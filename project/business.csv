As India cracks down on a suspected Pakistan-backed spy ring spreading across the country, one unsettling question emerges: How did Indian influencers end up working against their own country?At the center of this mystery is Noshaba Shehzad, a Pakistani businesswoman with high-level connections and a seemingly ordinary travel agency, Jaiyana Travel and Tourism. But behind the tourist brochures, Shehzad allegedly helped orchestrate a sophisticated espionage network with the backing of Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI).According to sources cited by NDTV, Shehzad isn’t just a travel agent, she’s “Madam N”, an ISI codename for the woman who reportedly laid the groundwork for a sleeper cell network inside India, with a target of recruiting up to 500 operatives who could blend in with the population unnoticed.Her strategy? Start with influencers. Arrested Instagram personality Jyoti Malhotra was allegedly among the many Indian citizens Shehzad lured into Pakistan under the pretext of cultural trips and tourism.But what began as guided visits soon turned into groundwork for spying.Sources say Shehzad worked hand-in-hand with Pakistani officials and ISI handlers, even manipulating the visa process through the Pakistani Embassy in Delhi.With just a call to key officials like Suhail Qamar (First Secretary, Visa) and Umar Sheryar (Counsellor, Trade), Shehzad could reportedly get Pakistani visas approved almost instantly for people she handpicked.She was also in close contact with Danish aka Ehsan-ur-Rehman, a known ISI operative working at the embassy until he was expelled in May—shortly after Malhotra’s arrest. Notably, Madam N’s husband is said to be a retired officer of Pakistan’s civil services, adding another layer to her insider access.Though there is no official tourism corridor between India and Pakistan, Shehzad allegedly managed to send over 3,000 Indian citizens and 1,500 NRIs across the border in just six months. Many of these trips were organized under the banner of religious pilgrimage, Sikh and Hindu yatras permitted only through her agency, thanks to a tie-up with Pakistan’s Evacuee Trust Property Board.Investigators believe the agency was used not only to facilitate travel but also to funnel funds into anti-India propaganda efforts. Pilgrims were reportedly overcharged, with the excess diverted for covert operations.Shehzad’s network didn’t stop at Pakistan’s border.

Census to pave way for nationwide delimitation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/census-to-pave-way-for-nationwide-delimitation/articleshow/121660013.cms,"Entire Census 2027 data may be released in 3 yrs

NEW DELHI: Population data returned by the upcoming 'Census 2027', due to begin on April 1, 2026, will pave the way for a countrywide delimitation of Lok Sabha and assembly constituencies, as the March 1, 2027 reference date makes it ""the first Census to be held after 2026"".However, the chances of delimitation being completed in time for the 2029 general election appear bleak, given that the final population data may take time to be published. The final population data for Census 2011 was published almost two years after release of the provisional data in March-end 2011. Even with a 'digital' Census - which is expected to facilitate early release of tables - there may be a considerable time lag between completion of the exercise in March 2027 and availability of the final population count to enable initiation of the delimitation process.The home ministry on Thursday took to X to explain the delay in conducting the Census, put on hold five years ago due to the Covid outbreak, stating that hiring lakhs of school teachers as enumerators would have immensely disrupted primary education already hit by the pandemic.The home ministry also cited issues in quality and coverage of Census conducted by other countries immediately after the Covid-19 pandemic.The Census declared by govt on Wednesday fulfils the criterion laid down in the 84th constitutional amendment for a fresh countrywide delimitation.“The relevant cutoff here is the March 1, 2027 reference date for the upcoming Census. Population enumeration is to be done in Feb 2027, and the population count — the primary input for the next delimitation — will be recorded as on March 1, 2027. Thus, the criterion of the upcoming Census being the first Census after 2026 is fulfilled,” said former chief election commissioner (CEC) N Gopalaswami, who was also ex officio member of the last Delimitation Commission chaired by Justice Kuldip Singh. Jay Vinayak Ojha from Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy added, “Article 82 of the Constitution provides for readjustment of seats between and within states after each Census. The 42nd amendment, passed in 1976, had provided that readjustment of constituencies would take place based on the figures of the first Census to be taken after the year 2000.Delimitation takes time — a couple of years, at least, though the 2002 one had taken six years — as it involves consultations with MPs, MLAs, state chief electoral officers, as well as public meetings in all states/Union Territories to record suggestions and hear objections and claims. Sources indicated that the entire Census 2027 data may be released in around three years; the population figures, much earlier. Interestingly, Finalising delimitation prior to the 2034 general election will work well in terms of plans to switch to ‘one nation-one election’ system, and the implementation of one-third reservation for women in legislature.","Census 2027 will pave the way for a countrywide delimitation of Lok Sabha and assembly constituencies.

1st passenger train to Srinagar on Saturday,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/1st-passenger-train-to-srinagar-on-saturday/articleshow/121659886.cms,"LUCKNOW: Neetu Sapra has bittersweet memories of the 14 years she spent in J&K since 1997.""No quarters, peak insurgency, Kargil War - it was a roller coaster,"" she says of life in a CRPF camp in Srinagar with a two-year-old son and a railway officer husband handling a project as fraught with danger as it was technically daunting. ""On a shopping trip to Lal Chowk in 1998, we narrowly escaped a bomb blast. The USBRL shaped us as much as we shaped it.""Neetu's story is intertwined with the Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla Rail Link (USBRL) that PM Narendra Modi is set to inaugurate Friday, marking the physical bridging of what was once considered a geographical implausibility: seamless rail connectivity from Kashmir to Kanyakumari.""Wives of all railway personnel associated with USBRL would have similar stories to tell,"" says Neetu, whose husband Suresh Kumar Sapra was then an executive engineer with Northern Railway.Sapra was posted in Udhampur when former PM H D Deve Gowda laid USBRL's foundation stone in Udhampur in early 1997. Many thought the task of carving a route through the undulating, terrorist-infested terrain was a fanciful idea.By April that year, India had a new PM in I K Gujral, and a second foundation ceremony was soon planned in Srinagar for the Qazigund-Baramulla section.Sapra recalls receiving an official note from his senior colleague Sandeep Gupta - the executive engineer assigned to lead the 13-strong technical team - to proceed to Srinagar for the July 12, 1997, event.With the odds as steep as the Pir Panjal, the team got cracking. ""Srinagar was synonymous with militancy. Nobody was prepared,"" Gupta, who retired as USBRL's chief administrative officer in Feb this year, writes in the 2009 TOI coffee table book, 'Linking Paradise: A Northern Railway Project'.""We had no choice but to dive in. This was bigger than us,"" he writes in the book, remembering how his team got by erratic phone and electricity connections and an inadequate number of vehicles.Sapra's trip to Srinagar from Udhampur to lay the ground for the foundation ceremony prepared him for what lay ahead.""Just 13km beyond Udhampur, we dodged the possibility of death by a few metres as a landslide occurred in front of our eyes. The national highway was blocked for 48 hours."" A week later, Gupta joined them, reaching Srinagar on a rickety van. A team from CRPF's 69th battalion was then occupying the railway-owned holiday home in Srinagar's Tulsi Bagh, leaving Gupta's team to cram into four dingy rooms within the complex.""We had only candles for light and hauled water in buckets from CRPF tankers,"" says Sapra, currently principal executive director in the Research Design and Standards Organisation in Lucknow.Living conditions and logistics remained a challenge throughout. The state power department refused to restore electricity to the railway facility, citing unpaid bills throughout a decade of unrest. It took several meetings with the then divisional commissioner of Kashmir, SL Bhat, for power supply to be restored. Mudassara, the PA to DoT's then general manager, intervened to provide landlines.On Nov 12, 1997, a railway survey team comprising two officers, three junior engineers and six helpers reached Nowgam (later named Srinagar railway station) on a cloudy, uneasy morning. Locals mistook them for a police raid party, causing an already tense situation to almost spiral out of control.""I had butterflies in my stomach due to sheer anxiety and fear,"" Gupta recalls in his essay.Every day, a road-opening party would set out ahead of the railway survey team to detect and defuse potential mines. After spending weeks studying topography sheets and working out other details, Gupta and Sapra drove the first two wooden pegs into the ground to mark the project's first alignment.""It felt like we had planted a dream,"" recalls Sapra.As winter took hold, the survey covered Pampore and Kakapora. The first snowfall of 1997 came on Nov 27. Work had to be halted by Dec 15. The team would return next April to resume work.""On our off days, we hunted for vegetarian food in Srinagar. However, the CRPF wasn't happy about our venturing out of the railways complex,"" reminisces Gupta.While surveying Anantnag, the team would run into surrendered militants still carrying AK-47s. ""They looked intimidating, but didn't do us harm; in fact, they seemed encouraging,"" says Gupta.By Oct 31, 1998, the Qazigund-Baramulla survey report was ready. The railway team didn't just beat the odds; they completed the task ahead of schedule.After the Baramulla-Qazigund section, Sapra and his colleagues were asked to survey the proposed Katra-Qazigund stretch. That was in 2001. The then rail minister Nitish Kumar laid the foundation for this portion two years later.""During the survey, we closely observed how difficult life was for people of the Valley. Pregnant women, critically ill patients and elderly people would be brought down from hilly terrain on makeshift palanquins as there were no roads. Mules and horses were the only modes of transport to ferry goods,"" recalls Sapra.Just when things seemed to be going well, tragedy struck on June 25, 2004, when IRCON engineer R N Pundhir and his brother were kidnapped and killed by terrorists at Sugan in Shopian. ""It was a jolt. Work paused. But buoyed by local sympathy and police support, the railway men restarted with the same zeal,"" writes Bhanu Prakash, the then deputy chief engineer of USBRL, in his memoir.The first trial run in Oct 2008, from Budgam to Kakapora, was a milestone in more ways than one. A Hindu priest, a Muslim cleric and a Sikh granthi presided over prayers before the train rolled in at 30kmph. ""Locals lined the tracks and children skipped school to see the trial run. Even the cattle seemed puzzled!"" recounts Bhanu.By the time the Qazigund-Baramulla section was commissioned in 2009, tracks were ready for trains to run at speeds of up to 100kmph.Built at a cost of around Rs 44,000 crore, including a parallel highway, the 272km rail route has 36 tunnels and 943 bridges, including the world's highest, the Chenab Bridge.The rail route promises all-weather connectivity, slashing the 800km Delhi-Srinagar journey to under 13 hours.This isn't just a story of steel tracks, concrete arches and staggering statistics. USBRL is an odyssey of workers and officials fighting the elements, braving the threat of guns, and enduring separation from their families to finally ""connect"" Kashmir to the rest of India.",The Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla Rail Link (USBRL) will be inaugurated by PM Narendra Modi on Friday. Neetu Sapra's husband Suresh Kumar Sapra was then an executive engineer with Northern Railway.

accidental gunshot injury

, rules SC

NEW DELHI: The friendship between Vaibhav and Mangesh, who studied homeopathy, came to a tragic end in Sept 2010, when Mangesh, while playing with Vaibhav's father's service gun, accidentally shot himself fatally. A panic-stricken Vaibhav dumped the body and cleaned up the scene of the accident.The trial court and Bombay high court concurrently convicted him of murder in 2012. Over a decade later, Supreme Court acquitted Vaibhav of murder charges.The trial court had believed the prosecution's version of events - that Vaibhav killed Mangesh using his father's service gun when the latter came to drop him home after college. He then called two of his friends to help dispose of the body and clean the blood stains at the scene of the crime. HC had dismissed his appeal.In SC, the bullet's trajectory came to Vaibhav's rescue.The bullet had exited from the downward portion of Mangesh's skull and then hit the ventilator above the door. His counsel argued that such a trajectory was only possible in case of a suicidal death and not homicidal.On the conduct of the accused, the counsel said the young man panicked seeing his friend motionless in a pool of blood. Fearing his father's wrath, he dumped the body and cleaned the scene ofhis friend's accidental death.A bench of justices B V Nagarathna and Satish C Sharma said, ""No doubt, the deceased was shot by the pistol belonging to the father of the appellant and in the house of the appellant, but the pertinent question that craves for an answer is - who pulled the trigger? Despite two rounds of litigation, the question is yet to find answer.""Doing the work of a detective with a keen eye for details, the bench said while the trajectory of the bullet was admittedly upwards as it hit the ventilator, which was at a much higher level than the height of the deceased, the prosecution's story was that Vaibhav shot Mangesh in the eye without proving the trajectory of the bullet.Writing the judgment, Justice Sharma said, ""The prosecution version remains acceptable only till the point of entry of the bullet through the eye, but it starts becoming cloudy when the upward trajectory of the bullet is analysed further... Such a trajectory of the bullet could have been possible only if the deceased was sitting and looking downwards towards the barrel of the pistol from a close distance. It was only then that the bullet could have hit the ventilator despite exiting from the lower part of the skull. "" ""The present case ticks the boxes of an accidental gunshot injury, both in theory and in fact,"" the bench said while acquitting Vaibhav of murder charges.","The trial court and Bombay high court concurrently convicted him of murder in 2012.

Yunus has been an effective figurehead but needs to move faster to retain popular support: David Taylor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/yunus-has-been-an-effective-figurehead-but-needs-to-move-faster-to-retain-popular-support-david-taylor/articleshow/121656787.cms,"Former Dean of Humanities and Interim Pro-Vice Chancellor of the Asian University for Women in Bangladesh's Chittagong talks to TOI about the forthcoming polls

and the challenges in Dhaka's political transition

Ten months down the line do you think that the Yunus government has been successful in carrying out key reforms as was demanded by the July-August protesters?

What is your opinion of how the interim govt has handled Islamic fundamentalism and the rise of the Jamiat's influence in the country?

How has the political climate impacted the welfare of minorities, especially Hindus? There have been reports of persecution of Hindu residents.

Major political parties like BNP have demanded early elections preferably by December. The demand has now been endorsed by the army chief. Do you see the Yunus govt committing to the deadline of Dec 25-Jun 2026?

How do you see the Bangladesh army's role in the current situation? It was initially criticized for having abandoned former PM Sheikh Hasina.

Students in the country have metamorphosed from a group of protestors to a political party. As a former Pro-VC do you think they have the capability and capacity to meet the aspirations of the people?

As someone who was teaching and mentoring women students till recently what is your opinion of women's freedoms in Bangladesh? Are they more free now than before?

You have studied civil society in south Asia closely. Chief advisor Yunus was very successful at groundbreaking volunteer work and creating the SHG system in Bangladesh that has been lauded by the world. Do you think his transition as a politician has been as successful?

Do you think elections can be inclusive and fair when one of the major political parties has been banned?

Progress in carrying out key reforms has been slower than the protesters had hoped. Yunus's strategy has been to try to create a consensus around a list of reforms, some of which will require major constitutional changes. This consensus has not been easy to achieve, given the political divisions between the major parties as well as the expectations of the protesters. The dilemma that he faces is that to produce a well thought out programme of reform will take time, while the political parties that had lost out during the period of Awami League rule want to seize the moment to come to power.The evidence here is somewhat anecdotal and I don’t feel I have enough data to make an informed comment. The interim government has created space for the Jamaat by lifting the ban on its activities but it is too early to say whether it has been able to enlarge its support base. Nor is it clear how far the Jamaat is prepared to operate within the constitutional framework that the interim government puts in place.As far as I can see, the reports of attacks on members of the Hindu minority are best seen as isolated, if worrisome, events rather than part of any concerted campaign. However, times of political uncertainty such as the present create conditions in which such attacks are more likely.This is the dilemma that Yunus and his colleagues face. The logic of democracy would call for early elections but the most likely beneficiary of early elections would be the BNP, which in many ways is part of the previous political system against which the students revolted. The BNP had been the target of state repression under the Awami League, it’s true, but its approach to political power would most likely be very similar in its use of patronage and its vulnerability to corruption.As in Pakistan, the army has the power to intervene in politics either directly or indirectly. While it is clear that its decision not to back Sheikh Hasina’s violent crackdown on protesters was crucial in her downfall and that it preferred to bring in an interim government, it also seems plausible that it really does want to see fresh elections and a fresh start. There are parallels here with its role in the 1990s upheavals in Bangladesh.Students in many countries have taken the lead in protesting against autocratic regimes but the next step of creating a permanent voice in politics is often very difficult. In Bangladesh the National Citizen Party represents the view of an important section of the student movement but it is likely to find it difficult to sustain a sufficiently high level of support to win power.I don’t see a major shift in the position of women in Bangladesh. Economic development over the last few decades has created new opportunities for women from all socio-economic classes but there have been only gradual changes to social expectations of women’s roles except among small sections of the middle and upper class.Muhammad Yunus has been an effective figurehead for a process of political transition but needs to move faster if he is to maintain popular support.There’s huge public feeling in favour of banning the Awami League, given the experience of the July/August 2024 movement and the use of state violence against it, but there’s also a significant residual support for the party as well. If it can’t participate, it may shore up trouble for the future.",The BNP has been banned from holding elections for a year and a half. The party is expected to make a comeback after the ban is lifted. The BNP is also expected to win back some of the votes it lost in the last election.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121656812,imgsize-52594,width-400,resizemode-4/121656812.jpg"

ICCT and IIT Roorkee released a comprehensive review of EV emissions. CAQM Chairperson Rajesh Verma warned of unchecked vehicle growth: “Vehicles have increased 21 times since 1981—but roads have barely doubled.”Amitabh Kant, India’s G20 Sherpa, cited the economic and health toll of pollution in Delhi and called for immediate reforms, including electrification of two- and three-wheelers and adoption of solar-powered technologies in small industries. “Delhi loses Rs 100,000 crore and 6.3 years of life expectancy annually to pollution.

The UAE’s Golden Visa has become a powerful symbol of the country’s ambition to attract the best minds from across the world. Ten years of residency, no need for a local sponsor, family sponsorship rights, and the promise of professional freedom in one of the most connected hubs of the 21st century—few offers are more attractive to high-achieving graduates.That allure only grew stronger after a landmark policy update in April 2022.

What’s gone wrong between Musk & Trump?

Tesla share price crash: Where’s the stock headed?

The situation appears precarious now. Initially, Tesla's stock benefited substantially from Musk's association with Trump.

Currently, investor confidence appears shaken, resulting in substantial paper losses for Musk's personal Tesla shareholding, dropping $20 billion in a single day.

SpaceX in trouble?

Tesla share price crash: Elon Musk and Donald Trump’s escalating spat has wiped out a whopping $150 billion from Tesla’s market cap. Tesla's share price crashed over 14% as shareholders hastily sold their positions during an escalating verbal dispute between the US President Donald Trump and the Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who is currently the wealthiest individual globally.Following Donald Trump's election, investors poured vast sums into Tesla shares, prioritising political considerations over financial performance.The consequences of this strategy became evident on Thursday when within three hours, the situation took a dramatic turn!The conflict originated from discussions about the president's budget legislation before intensifying rapidly. Following Musk's assertion regarding his role in Trump's electoral victory, Trump suggested potential governmental actions against Musk's enterprises, including Tesla and SpaceX.Trump expressed his views on Truth Social, stating: ""The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon's Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn't do it!""Also Read | ‘Electric cars that nobody else wanted…’: Donald Trump’s shocking words on Elon Musk; says Biden should have terminated Musk’s subsidies Tesla share price crash on Thursday partly offset a significant increase that occurred during the eight-week period after Musk announced Tesla's plans to launch an autonomous, driverless ""robotaxi"" service in Austin, Texas, this month.The market participants are concerned that Trump's potential stance might slow down the advancement of autonomous vehicles in the United States, which could adversely affect Tesla.The company's current electric vehicle business faces challenges, making it crucial for them to swiftly transition into the era of driverless vehicles.""The whole goal of robotaxis is to have them in 20 or 25 cities next year,"" said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, a prominent Tesla supporter who now expresses concern. ""If you start to heighten the regulatory environment, that could delay that path,” Ives said according to an Associated Press report.He further stated, ""There is a fear that Trump is not going to play Mr. Nice Guy.""Following the November presidential election, investor enthusiasm drove Tesla's market value up by over $450 billion within weeks. Investors anticipated substantial gains from reduced regulatory oversight under Trump's administration and were optimistic about Musk's autonomous vehicle initiatives for American roads.The shares peaked on December 17, but subsequently declined when Musk's leadership of a government efficiency committee sparked boycotts and damaged Tesla's image. The stock has recently rebounded after Musk announced his renewed focus on Tesla and its forthcoming autonomous taxi service.The potential reduction in government contracts appears to majorly affect SpaceX rather than Tesla. SpaceX, a private space enterprise, has secured substantial NASA funding for International Space Station missions, including astronaut transport, cargo delivery, and various space operations. The company is currently developing a large-scale rocket for NASA's upcoming lunar mission scheduled for next year.Starlink, operating as a SpaceX division specialising in satellite internet services, has seemingly profited from Musk's previous cordial relationship with Trump.During his Middle Eastern visit with Trump last month, Musk revealed Saudi Arabia's approval for Starlink's aviation and maritime operations. Although the influence of political factors remains uncertain, recent agreements in Bangladesh, Pakistan, India and other nations have emerged amid Trump's tariff warnings and diplomatic pressures.SpaceX's recent achievements are reflected in its valuation, which reached $350 billion through private financing and share sales, marking a significant increase from $210 billion in the previous year.","Investor confidence appears shaken, resulting in substantial paper losses for Musk's personal Tesla shareholding, dropping $20 billion in a single day.

As the climate crisis continues to threaten ecosystems, biodiversity, and human health, global environmental action is more important than ever. World Environment Day offers a moment of collective reflection and a platform to amplify solutions. Celebrated annually on June 5, it serves as a global reminder that environmental protection is not just a responsibility of governments but of every individual and community.Every year on June 5, people across the globe unite to celebrate World Environment Day, an initiative led by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). In 2025, this globally significant day will be hosted by the Republic of Korea, with a strong focus on one of the most pressing challenges of our time: plastic pollution.From schools to governments, environmentalists to artists, millions of people will participate in activities that raise awareness and push for action to safeguard our planet. This article explores the theme, history, significance, poster ideas, and host country for World Environment Day 2025.The official theme for World Environment Day 2025 is “Beat Plastic Pollution.” The campaign aims to raise global awareness about the harmful impacts of plastic waste on ecosystems, wildlife, and human health.Plastic pollution has become a planetary crisis, with microplastics now found in the deepest oceans, remote mountain peaks, and even inside the human body.Plastic production has skyrocketed from 2 million tonnes in 1950 to over 430 million tonnes today, according to UNEP. A large portion of this plastic is single-use and ends up in landfills, rivers, and oceans. The 2025 campaign urges nations, industries, and individuals to reduce dependency on plastic, adopt sustainable alternatives, and promote responsible production and consumption.For 2025, the Republic of Korea will serve as the global host country for World Environment Day. Known for its innovation and commitment to green technology, South Korea offers a fitting backdrop to a campaign focused on eliminating plastic pollution.The country has already made strides in sustainability through advanced recycling systems, plastic bans in major retail outlets, and investments in eco-friendly alternatives. By hosting the event, South Korea aims to spotlight scalable, tech-driven solutions and inspire global cooperation to phase out harmful plastic use.Here are some poster concepts and taglines to help students, creators, and event organizers promote awareness:These posters can be used in schools, colleges, and community centers or shared digitally on social media as part of the awareness drive.World Environment Day was first established in 1972 during the Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment, which marked the beginning of global environmental consciousness. The first celebration took place in 1973, and since then, June 5 has become a cornerstone for environmental action.Each year, UNEP assigns a different country to host the event and highlights a key environmental theme. Previous years have focused on climate change, biodiversity loss, and ecosystem restoration. The annual event now engages over 150 countries and millions of people through tree plantation drives, clean-up campaigns, sustainability workshops, and policy-level dialogues.While climate reports and scientific warnings continue to grow urgent, World Environment Day serves as a powerful reminder that every small action counts. The event promotes:The 2025 focus on plastic pollution is especially timely. With more than 19 to 23 million tonnes of plastic entering aquatic ecosystems every year, urgent and collective action is needed.Whether you're a student, teacher, parent, artist, or entrepreneur, there are many ways to join the World Environment Day movement:World Environment Day 2025 is more than just a date on the calendar. It is a call to action. With the Republic of Korea leading the global initiative and the theme of “Beat Plastic Pollution” guiding the efforts, this year is set to be a landmark in the fight for a plastic-free, sustainable future. Let us use this opportunity to reflect, engage, and act, not just for one day but every day. Because when we protect the environment, we protect ourselves.","The official theme for World Environment Day 2025 is “Beat Plastic Pollution” The campaign aims to raise global awareness about the harmful impacts of plastic waste on ecosystems, wildlife, and human health.

Eminem vs Meta: Unauthorised use of music

What Meta said on the lawsuit

Grammy-winning rapper Eminem has filed a lawsuit of $109 million against Facebook-parent Meta accusing it of copyright infringement. The lawsuit, filed by Eminem’s music publishing company, Eight Mile Style, accuses Meta of the ""unauthorised storage, reproduction, and exploitation"" of 243 of Eminem's songs across its platforms.As per the court documents seen by People, Eight Mile Style alleges that Meta's in-app features, such as ""Original Audio"" and ""Reels Remix,"" have actively encouraged and allowed users to incorporate Eminem's music into their video content without proper licensing or attribution. The lawsuit further claims that this has led to rapper's songs being used in millions of videos and streamed billions of times, resulting in diminished value of the copyrights and lost profits for the publisher.As reported by People, the lawsuit alleges that Meta has allowed its users to store, reproduce and exploit Eminem’s songs through features like Original Audio and Reels Remix, which enable users to incorporate music into their content without proper attribution or licensing.Eight Mile Style is seeking statutory damages of $150,000 per song, per platform (Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp), which could accumulate to the total sum exceeding $109 million. The publisher has also requested a jury trial and a permanent injunction to prevent Meta from future unauthorised use of Eminem's music.Meta has not yet issued a public comment directly on the lawsuit. However, a companyspokesperson told People that the company has licenses with thousands of partners around the world and the company has also been negotiating with Eight Mile Style. “Meta has licenses with thousands of partners around the world and an extensive global licensing program for music on its platforms. Meta had been negotiating in good faith with Eight Mile Style, but rather than continue those discussions, Eight Mile Style chose to sue,” said Meta spokesperson.","Eminem has filed a lawsuit of $109 million against Facebook-parent Meta.

Why Tesla has not paid Elon Musk

What’s next for Elon Musk’s pay?

Despite being one of the most influential figures in the tech and automotive industries, Elon Musk received zero salary from Tesla in 2024, making him the lowest-paid CEO among S&P 500 companies. As reported by the Wall Street Journal, Musk’s compensation structure has been a subject of debate for years. His 2018 pay package, which was designed to grant him stock options based on Tesla’s performance milestones, was twice struck down in court, leaving him without formal compensation. While Tesla’s valuation has skyrocketed—growing over 2,000% in the past seven years—Musk has not received a paycheck during this period.As mentioned above, Elon Musk’s salary package was approved by Tesla shareholders in 2018. As part of the agreement his entire compensation was tied to the company’s overall performance and market capitalisation milestones.Under this structure, Musk was granted stock options that would vest only if Tesla hit specific, escalating targets for market capitalisation, revenue, and adjusted EBITDA. Over the years, as Tesla's valuation soared and it met many of these goals, the package became immensely valuable, potentially making it the largest compensation deal in corporate history.The legal battle over Musk’s $56 billion stock award has prevented Tesla from issuing him compensation. Courts have ruled that the approval process for his pay package was flawed, leading to its rejection despite shareholder support.Musk himself has acknowledged the situation, stating that he has worked without pay for years. However, with Tesla facing market volatility and leadership concerns, some experts argue that it may be time to restructure his compensation to ensure stability and long-term commitment.Tesla’s board is now weighing options for a new compensation plan. Some analysts suggest a performance-based stock package, while others argue Musk should receive a traditional CEO salary to align with industry standards.","Elon Musk received zero salary from Tesla in 2024, making him the lowest-paid CEO among S&P 500 companies.

Dubai has made a generous move to support its citizens as Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai, orders the waiver of Dh101 million in mortgage debts for 303 Emirati nationals. This decision, announced ahead of the Eid Al Adha celebrations, highlights the UAE’s ongoing commitment to improving the quality of life for its people. It reflects the leadership’s focus on social welfare, economic stability, and creating a caring society. The gesture is part of a wider vision to ensure citizens can celebrate the festive season with greater financial ease and peace of mind.As Dubai gears up to celebrate Eid Al Adha, this historic decision to forgive housing loans is a demonstration of the UAE values of benevolence, unity, and accountability in leadership. It is not just relief from financial burdens but also a sense of national cohesion and confidence between the government and citizens.The program was executed under the instructions of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai. The exemption of debt is in line with the efforts of the leadership to increase citizens' quality of life and support social stability.Sheikh Hamdan, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, and Chairman of The Executive Council of Dubai, implemented the directive on June 4, a day before the beginning of the Eid holidays. The news, issued through a tweet from the Dubai Media Office, was particularly symbolic in that it was delivered during the first ten days of Dhul Hijjah, a significant period for Muslims characterised by acts of piety, charity, and the holy pilgrimage of Hajj.Eid Al Adha, a celebration of sacrifice and generosity, also increased the significance of this move, providing economic relief and happiness to hundreds of Emirati families preparing to celebrate one of the holiest festivals of the Islamic calendar.This mortgage forgiveness is not a one-off move. The UAE over the past few weeks has seen a string of measures that have helped to relieve its citizens of their financial burdens:These policies are part of a unified national approach aimed at enhancing social ties, sustaining justice, and sustaining economic prosperity throughout the Emirates.The UAE leadership continues to provide a regional model for humane leadership. Cancelling the debt of more than 300 citizens is an expression of the government's long-standing desire to ensure that financial burdens do not impinge on the social and individual growth of the citizens. By combining strategic leadership with humane values, the UAE is solidifying its position as a forward-thinking and people-centred country.","Dubai initiative waives Dh101 million in housing loans for 303 citizens.

One of the problems with watching the Star Wars prequel is that one knows what happens. For example, it’s inevitable that Anakin Skywalker would eventually become Darth Vader, turning on his great friend and mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi. The same was apparent to anyone who saw the bromance between Elon Musk and Donald Trump : two oversized egos who forged an unlikely partnership to destroy wokeism and Make America Great Again. And yet, behind the bromance, with Trump loving Elon’s rocket landings and Elon praising Trump, the fallout was always coming. The trigger? T rump’s Big Beautiful Bill. If the American republic is a reality show, then Donald Trump and Elon Musk were its breakout power couple. One sold steaks and slogans, the other sold flamethrowers and tunnels. For a moment, they were the tech-and-tantrum axis, the double helix of power and platform. But like all primetime pairings, their arc had a third-act twist—less redemption, more Game of Thrones firestorm.Read: A timeline of the meltdown There was a time, not long ago, when Elon Musk and Donald Trump were on different planets—ideologically, intellectually, and ecologically. Musk publicly distanced himself from Trump during his first term, even resigning from the White House advisory councils in 2017 after Trump pulled the US out of the Paris Climate Agreement.Musk was more Silicon Valley libertarian than nationalist firebrand; Trump, more Rust Belt messiah than Martian coloniser.But politics, like spaceflight, is about trajectory. And in July 2024, after an attempt on Trump’s life during the campaign trail, Musk’s compass shifted. He endorsed Trump. Loudly. Repeatedly. He became the single largest donor to the Republican campaign with nearly $300 million in funding. SpaceX's Starlink was praised during the campaign, particularly for its potential to provide reliable internet access in rural areas—an area of focus for Trump’s second-term infrastructure promises.Behind the scenes, Musk enabled the tech bros to go with Trump, helping to realise the intellectual blueprint associated with Curtis Yarvin. Curtis Yarvin, a Silicon Valley-based political theorist and blogger also known by his pen name 'Mencius Moldbug,' is often credited as a founding intellectual figure of the New Right and the 'neoreactionary' movement. His ideology favours strong executive power and a technocratic elite over liberal democracy—an outlook that resonated with Musk's growing contempt for traditional institutions and love for systems engineering. And with his typical flair for drama, Musk turned what was once quiet admiration into full-throttle political support. Trump responded with the one currency he deals in best: spectacle.By early 2025, the bromance had been institutionalised. Trump appointed Musk to head the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency—DOGE. If the name sounded like a meme, it was because it was one. Musk, now a cabinet-level bureaucrat with budgetary scissors, had free rein to slash overhead and theoretically save the American taxpayer trillions. Within weeks, he was livestreaming audits, tweeting cost-cutting charts, and posting memes of bureaucrats turned into “NPCs. ”Meanwhile, Trump basked in the Musk glow. At a Mar-a-Lago fundraiser, he reportedly insisted the band play Space Oddity as a tribute to Musk and mused to guests about how “those rockets, they’re just incredible—beautiful machines.” It wasn’t policy. It was pageantry. They travelled together. They went to UFC fights. Musk's son, X Æ A-12, appeared at White House events. For a while, Musk was ""First Buddy""—unofficial, unfiltered, and ever online.Cracks had begun to show even earlier. One major source of tension was the so-called MAGA Civil War over H-1B visas. In early 2025, Trump’s base erupted over what they perceived as a betrayal of the America First doctrine, particularly as Trump’s administration floated limited reforms to streamline high-skilled immigration. Musk, a vocal advocate for retaining and attracting top engineering talent from abroad, defended the H-1B program, calling it essential for innovation in AI, automotive tech, and aerospace. This did not sit well with the populist flank of the GOP. Hardline Trump allies began to attack Musk, accusing him of putting corporate interests above American workers. Right-wing influencers branded him a 'globalist Trojan horse,' and social media became a battleground where MAGA’s nationalist rhetoric clashed with Musk’s techno-libertarianism.Around the same time, the Trump administration introduced a tariff framework designed to penalise countries that subsidised exports into the US—raising concerns among tech companies. Musk, who had publicly criticised similar tariffs in the past, warned they would increase domestic production costs for high-tech manufacturers like Tesla. It made importing components more expensive, while offering no meaningful relief for US-based innovation.The online vitriol was an early signal that Musk’s ideological alignment with Trump’s base was more fragile than it appeared.But alliances built on mutual flattery have the shelf life of a Tesla’s steering wheel. Trouble emerged with Trump’s signature “One Big Beautiful Bill”—a sprawling tax and spending plan. While MAGA world cheered its middle-class tax cuts and deficit reduction promises, Musk bristled at its axe-swinging on clean energy incentives, particularly EV subsidies.Musk wasn’t subtle about it. In public posts, he attacked the bill as irresponsible. In private meetings, he warned Republican allies it would hurt American innovation. But most significantly, he realised the bill—and its supporters—no longer needed him. He had gone from insider to inconvenience.In May 2025, Musk stepped down from DOGE. Officially, it was to “refocus on private ventures.” Unofficially, the writing was on the wall.The final straw came in June, with the subtlety of a SpaceX booster detonation. At a closed-door White House meeting, Trump reportedly voiced his disappointment with Musk’s public criticisms. Musk, mid-meeting, fired off posts on X denouncing the bill and reminding the world he had ""bankrolled the campaign.""He reposted content calling for Trump’s impeachment. It was no longer dissent—it was defiance.Trump hit back.He publicly threatened to terminate federal contracts and subsidies for Tesla, SpaceX, and Starlink, claiming it would save ""Billions and Billions of Dollars.""By day's end, Tesla had lost 14.3% in market value. Musk, in turn, stoked conspiracy fires by suggesting Trump’s name might be in the unreleased Epstein files. No evidence. Just thermonuclear innuendo.The markets shook. SpaceX's NASA contracts went into limbo. Musk’s loyalists cried betrayal. Some Republicans—Thomas Massie, Warren Davidson—sided with him. Most stayed with Trump.Trump pulled Jared Isaacman's NASA nomination, Musk's close friend, just days after the feud began. Peter Navarro and Musk reignited their mutual loathing over tariffs, with Musk publicly calling Navarro ""a moron.""Then came the money. Musk withheld the final $100 million of his $300 million donation, citing ""fiscal betrayal."" Trump responded by saying Musk had 'Trump Derangement Syndrome'. The digital divorce was final.In the end, this wasn’t just about electric vehicles or deficits. It was about two men who see themselves as the singular protagonists of American destiny—and couldn't tolerate a shared spotlight. Trump wanted a loyal industrialist. Musk wanted a blank cheque. Neither got what they wanted.Now, one controls the levers of state. The other commands the timeline. One speaks from a podium. The other from a rocket. And the rest of America is left scrolling through a billionaire breakup, meme by meme, post by post.","Elon Musk and Donald Trump forged unlikely partnership to destroy wokeism.

As the city chokes on its own pollution every year, its natural air purifier, the Delhi Ridge, is struggling to remain intact in the face of relentless expansion and commercialisation.The Ridge lies at the tail end of the nearly 1,500-million-year-old Aravalis that stretch from Gujarat, traverse Rajasthan and Haryana, and finally end in Delhi. With burgeoning construction and unauthorised settlements, the Ridge, often called Delhi’s green lungs, is gradually fading. In its southern reaches, especially, it fights a fierce battle for survival.Just beyond the boundary of Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary, a vital refuge for leopards and myriad species of birds and animals, Sanjay Colony offers a picture of stark contrast. Over the past few decades, this densely packed human settlement has grown rapidly, pushing its way into the Southern Ridge.A spot visit byrevealed a colony dotted with concrete structures and commercial establishments, with only a few fragments of wilderness left.Similarly, at Asola village in the Southern Ridge, over 38 hectares are encroached upon. Indigenous trees, thorny bushes and ancient rocks have been replaced by manicured lawns of sprawling farmhouses.Carving out private estates from ridge land, Asola village is now synonymous with colossal gates and high walls of lavish farmhouses.It’s not just private structures; govt buildings have come up in the area too. Against a backdrop of trees, Maidan Garhi police station in the Southern Ridge has single-storey structures with concrete walls and a tin roof. During a visit,found many vehicles parked on the campus. When contacted, there was no response from Delhi Police.As per a 1994 Delhi govt notification under Section 4 of Indian Forest Act, these are forest lands. Defining the boundaries of Northern, Central, South-Central and Southern Ridge, the notification declared “all forest lands and wastelands which is govt property” within these specified regions would be classified as “reserved forest”.The four Ridges, spread over about 7,777 hectares, were declared Ridge Reserve Forest. In 1996, Delhi govt notified a 7-hectare area as Nanakpura Ridge, taking the total notified Ridge Reserve Forest to 7,784 hectares.Apart from the notified five Ridges, Delhi has a Morphological Ridge with similar physical and ecological features. An Introduction to Delhi Ridge , a book published by Delhi forest and wildlife department in 2014, says the Morphological Ridge is described on the basis of seismic zonation provided by Geological Survey of India Map of Delhi of 2006.“Though falling outside the notified Ridge forest land, it has Ridge-like features in respect of Aravali outcrop and vegetative cover,” says the book. It is granted the same level of protection following a 2011 Delhi high court order, which stated lands outside the notified Ridge areas, but with morphological features conforming to the Ridge, should be given the same protection as the notified Ridge area.Though it is not officially designated as a reserve forest under section 4 of Indian Forest Act, the approval of Ridge Management Board, Central Empowered Committee and the Supreme Court is required for undertaking any construction activity in Morphological Ridge.In a landmark judgment in 1996, the Supreme Court noted Delhi had two distinct features: “The Ridge, which is the rocky outcrop of Aravali Hills and the river Yamuna. Some parts of the Ridge have been erased in the central city area. No further infringement of the Ridge is to be permitted; it should be maintained in its pristine glory.”However, not much has been done on the ground to save the city’s Ridges in the past three decades, which remain “unprotected”. For full legal protection, the Section 4 notification should be followed by notification under Section 20 of Indian Forest Act after demarcation and settling of land rights.Though the Ridge areas were notified under Section 4, the final notification under Section 20 is pending even after 31 years. Even the management and ownership of Ridge reserve forest are under multiple agencies.There was no immediate response from the forest department.In 2013, activist Sonya Ghosh filed a plea in the National Green Tribunal seeking protection of the Ridge. The tribunal, in an order dated Jan 15, 2021, directed Delhi govt through the chief secretary to ensure the Section 20 notification within three months. It also directed the identification of the remaining area and an action plan for removing the encroachment within the next three months.However, encroachment removal from the Southern Ridge is progressing at a slow pace. Following demarcation by the revenue department, 398.6 hectares were identified as encroached in 2019, encompassing 18 villages that are home to lakhs of people. Of this, encroachment of only 91 hectares was removed till March 18 this year.On other Ridges, the extent of encroachment is still unknown. “It can be known only after demarcation,” said a senior forest official.“South-Central, Northern, Nanakpura and Central Ridges are yet to be demarcated on the ground. The forest and wildlife department has written to the revenue department and other land-owning agencies for joint demarcation,” said a March 18 affidavit filed by Delhi govt in NGT through the principal secretary (environment and forests).“Villages comprising the Southern and South-Central Ridges have been urbanised… However, urbanisation does not change the status of forest land. In 74 matters, different courts have granted a stay in respect of the demolition of encroachment over forest land in the southern ridge,” it added.Claiming “no concrete action” has been taken so far to remove encroachments from the Southern Ridge, Ghosh, who filed the case in NGT, said, “The forest department needs police backup for anti-encroachment drives, but it doesn’t get the assistance. Besides, there is political interference, and bastis came up in ridges with the support of politicians.""Sanjay Colony, she added, was to be removed on Supreme Court orders and alternate housing provided, but the authorities hadn't yet acted on the matter.In an affidavit dated April 5, Delhi forest and wildlife department informed NGT it will conduct the final Section 20 notification of the Southern Ridge, spread over 6,200 hectares, in three phases.The first phase encompasses roughly 3,300 hectares, for which a file was recently submitted to Delhi govt for final notification. This portion comprises forest land without encroachment or any pending litigations. Under Phase II, areas with encroachment but no pending litigations would be notified. The remaining parts would be notified in Phase III.Apart from encroachment, the Ridge is also under threat from cutting of trees for infrastructure projects. Last year, a plea was filed in SC claiming hundreds of trees were illegally felled for the widening of the road to the under-construction Central Armed Police Forces Institute of Medical Sciences.SC imposed a Rs 25,000 fine on each DDA official found responsible for cutting 1,670 trees without the court’s nod over their “contemptuous act”. The courts have been pulling up govt agencies for the past few years. HC in March this year lamented that “Delhi's agencies don't appear to be serious about protecting ridge forests”.The apex court’s Central Empowered Committee (CEC), in a report dated Sept 4 last year, said only five out of 20 govt projects whose conditional permission was given by the apex court for tree felling or translocation in the Ridge area from 2016 onwards complied with the terms. Among the conditions not met were compensatory plantation and the creation of a green belt at the site.“The project proponents are interested in complying with norms until trees are felled or translocated, and after the construction starts, they pay no heed to other conditions,” CEC said.In another report dated May 8, 2025, CEC found that the Ridge Management Board (RMB) approved 39 projects to carry out work in Ridge areas from 2015 onwards. It diverted 301.8 hectares of land — around 4% of Ridge area — for construction work.RMB was constituted on SC orders in 1995 under the chief secretary’s chairmanship to ensure the “Ridge is not occupied or encroached by any person for any authorised purpose”.However, in 2024, SC restrained it from clearing any project proposals for the diversion of Ridge forests without seeking its permission. On May 26 this year, SC suggested setting up a single “consolidated” authority to manage the Ridge.According to environmentalist Bhavreen Kandhari, “Ridge forests are under mounting pressure, not just from encroachments, but also from sanctioned developments like cafés, toilets and event spaces that erode their ecological sanctity. While authorities are removing unauthorised structures in areas like Sanjay Van, they are simultaneously introducing commercial amenities. This contradictory approach highlights the urgent need for clear demarcation of the Ridge. ”Delhi HC, she added, had directed the formation of a committee to oversee the demarcation and protection of these vital green spaces. “Without precise boundaries and unified management, the Ridge remains vulnerable to piecemeal degradation,” said Kandhari.CR Babu, professor emeritus and head of Centre for Environment Management of Degraded Ecosystems, said infrastructure development, encroachments and the dominance of invasive species were ailing the Ridge.“The British first brought Vilayati Kikar (Prosopis juliflora) from Mexico to Rajasthan in 1857 to make it green. They then introduced it in Delhi and broadcast its seeds in the Ridge. Nearly 150 years later, Vilayati Kikar is dominating the Ridge and eliminating the native species and their habitats, including moisture level in the soil, microflora and water level. Other invasive species, Lantana and Subabul, are also present in the Ridge,” said Babu.He said if the Aravalli Biodiversity Park model was adopted in the 22km floodplain of Yamuna and the Ridge restored to its natural glory, Delhi’s environmental problems, including pollution, urban heat island effect and urban flooding, would be resolved.“An Introduction to Delhi Ridge” says the Ridge acts as a barrier to the sandladen westerlies from the deserts of Rajasthan, protecting Delhi from desertification. “With increasing encroachment and felling of trees, this natural filtration system of the Ridge is weakening. Dust storms have become more frequent, and Delhi’s air quality has plummeted further, exacerbating respiratory illnesses among residents,” said Kandhari.","Delhi’s ecological shield is now a casualty of bureaucratic apathy, encroachments and token enforcement. The Ridge lies at the tail end of the nearly 1,500-million-year-old Aravalis that stretch from Gujarat, traverse Rajasthan and Haryana.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121664325,imgsize-1666624,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/121664325.jpg"

BENGALURU: The Axiom-4 (Ax-4) mission will have a fifth ""crew member""- ""Joy"", a soft, white toy baby swan that will travel with them to space as their zero-gravity indicator. But Joy isn't just a charming mascot. Her selection carries a quiet imprint from back home: Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla's six-year-old son, Kiash, who's also called Sid.The crew - commander Peggy Whitson, Shukla as pilot, and mission specialists Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski of Poland and Tibor Kapu of Hungary - unveiled the toy, symbolising grace and elegance, late Tuesday. Kapu said: ""Our first ideas all included animals, because we have one kid with the crew, Shux's kid, Sid who basically just loves animals... You know, show any animal to him, he will love it. We wanted to go with dinosaurs and lions, but we just couldn't find the right one, and we were extremely happy when we found Joy. ""About why they named the swan ""Joy"", mission commander Peggy Whitson said that it was Kapu who actually came up with her name. ""Why we selected the name, per se, might become more obvious once you hear the name of the vehicle. So, you'll have to wait for that,"" Whitson said.Axiom and the crew have kept the name of the vehicle - now just designated with a number - under wraps. It is expected to be announced either ahead of the launch or after.""...In Indian culture, the swan is the vehicle of goddess Saraswati, symbolising wisdom, learning, and purity. It is said to have the rare ability to separate milk from water, a symbolism that's a powerful reminder of discernment in an age of distraction. To carry the symbol is to carry the essence of formation, pursuit of knowledge, clarity of purpose, and grace under pressure,"" Shukla said.Whitson described Joy as a reflection of the cultural mix on board. ""More than just a companion, Joy will signal our arrival in microgravity shortly after launch. Through Joy, we'll celebrate our diversity and our unity in the shared journey of space exploration,"" she said. Axiom Space confirmed that the swan will serve as the zero-G indicator - a floating object that provides a visual cue of the transition into microgravity after launch. Plush toys have long served this role in space missions, particularly in commercial flights.But Joy, Axiom said, is more than just a functional object. ""Joy the baby swan embodies the shared pursuit of Isro, European Space Agency (ESA) and ] Hungarian to Orbit programme (Hunor) to soar high above our home planet. In this way, Joy represents cultural unity as three nations realise the return to human spaceflight together as one crew,"" the company said.Axiom added that the swan carries symbolic meanings across cultures. In India, it represents wisdom and purity; in Poland, it stands for loyalty and resilience; and in Hungary, it reflects grace and nature's beauty. ""By choosing a swan as the zero-G indicator, the Ax-4 crew celebrates the diversity of their cultures, united in the shared human experience of space exploration,"" Axiom said.","Axiom-4 mission will have a fifth ""crew member""- ""Joy"", a soft, white toy baby swan that will travel with them to space as their zero-gravity indicator.

"As Louisiana's governor faces ethics charges, his lawyer raises bar for future ethics investigations",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/as-louisianas-governor-faces-ethics-charges-his-lawyer-raises-bar-for-future-ethics-investigations/articleshow/121664476.cms,"As Louisiana's governor faces ethics charges, his lawyer raises bar for future ethics investigations (Image: AP)





NEW ORLEANS: Louisiana is poised to adopt new measures that watchdogs warn raise barriers to holding public officials accountable via the state's ethics board. The legislation was drafted by the personal attorney of Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, who faces charges brought by the board for violating state ethics laws.Proponents say the measures give those accused of ethics violations more opportunities to respond to allegations, increases transparency and limits abuses of a process they claim is often unjust. But watchdog groups - and the Board of Ethics - warn the changes will undermine the board's ability to hold public officials accountable.While the changes would not apply to Landry's current charges, the legislation further bolsters the governor's power over a state board largely made up of his own appointees. Having overwhelmingly passed in the House and Senate this week - only three lawmakers voted against it - the bill awaits Landry's signature.Republican Rep Gerald ""Beau"" Beaullieu, who sponsored the bill, said it was brought forth after officials complained that the board's investigation process was ""more like being investigated by the Gestapo.""Landry's office declined to comment.Another bill would share the names of complainants with officials they are accusing of wrongdoing, as well as limit the board's ability to launch investigations.Governor's lawyer behind the legislation Landry's private attorney, Stephen Gele, drafted the legislation, which the governor supports.Gele is defending Landry against ethics charges brought in 2023 for undisclosed free plane rides to Hawaii when he served as the state's attorney general. Gele said negotiations are progressing to ""amicably resolve the charges.""Last year, Gele warned lawmakers that the ethics board's investigatory powers are ""dangerous, unwarranted, and threaten well-established fundamental constitutional rights"" and he has sought to rein them in with new legislation.The bill's supporters say it gives the board more discretion about whether to pursue investigations and bring charges, cuts down on waste of taxpayer dollars and strengthens due process rights for the accused.Yet these changes are raising red flags.In a letter to lawmakers, the Board of Ethics warned that the bill's requirement to share copies of all subpoenas with officials under investigation allows them to ""influence a witness's documents or responses.""Critics say the bill undercuts the board's authority by granting local courts the power to quash investigations, gives officials opportunities to run out the clock on the board's one-year timeline to bring charges and prevents the board from investigating violations that were disclosed by public officials seeking the board's advisory opinion.The bill also requires a two-thirds board vote to approve an investigation into a sworn complaint and another two-thirds vote on whether to file charges. Current policy requires only majority votes.Barry Erwin, president of the Council for a Better Louisiana, a nonpartisan government accountability group, said the bill's two-thirds vote requirements constitute a ""high bar to overcome"" for a board of political appointees.""I just think in real life, in very political situations, it's hard for some of these board members to act with the independence in the system we had before,"" Erwin said.A bill that will reduce complaints The other bill under consideration - which Gele said he did not craft and Landry has not publicly supported - would require anyone bringing an ethics complaint to disclose their name and file the complaint in person at the ethics board offices in Baton Rouge. The bill passed in the House with only seven lawmakers opposed and is pending final passage in the Senate.In a legislative committee hearing, David Bordelon, general counsel for the ethics board, warned that the bill would enable officials ""to intimidate a witness or potentially alter information that's requested."" Bordelon said the measure would ""drastically reduce the number of complaints.""The legislation's sponsor, Republican Rep Kellee Hennessey Dickerson, said her bill is part of a fight for ""truth"" and ""justice.""""For those of us who have been through it, it helps develop peace of mind, knowing who your accuser is, especially when you are spending thousands upon thousands of dollars to try and clear your good name,"" said Dickerson, who was fined $1,500 for an ethics violation in 2023.She argued people frequently file complaints to harass their political opponents. Bordelon countered that the board dispassionately evaluates complaints and provides the accused with the opportunity to defend themselves if charges are brought.The bill also prevents the ethics board from launching investigations based on non-governmental sources such as media reports.Governor dominates state ethics board Following legislation passed last year, the governor directly appoints nine of the board's 15 members, with the Legislature appointing the rest.Officials with the legislative and executive branches now have more control over those who may be tasked with investigating them, watchdogs note.""It's gone from a process that was as much arm's length away from politics as we could make it, and we had it that way for many years, to a process now that is very much more political than we've ever seen it,"" Erwin said. ""It's going to be very difficult for the board to act in a way that guarantees that kind of oversight we want to have.""","Louisiana is poised to adopt new measures that watchdogs warn raise barriers to holding public officials accountable via the state's ethics board. The legislation was drafted by the personal attorney of Republican Gov.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

US bond yields are likely to fall further which will be positive for EMs, particularly India, whose growth prospects are the brightest.“In today’s monetary policy the RBI is likely to cut policy rates by 25 bp.

"Mumbai Penguin Language Row: ‘Born in Maharashtra, must be named in Marathi’ Penguins now part of language row in Mumbai",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/born-in-maharashtra-must-be-named-in-marathi-penguins-now-part-of-language-row-in-mumbai/articleshow/121637955.cms,"Poll Should the penguin chicks at the Byculla zoo be given Marathi names instead of English ones? Yes, Marathi names are more appropriate No, English names should continue





NEW DELHI: A row has erupted in Mumbai over the naming of three newly hatched penguin chicks at the city’s Byculla zoo with BJP leaders demanding they be given Marathi names instead of English ones.The protest, led by BJP functionary Nitin Bankar from the Byculla assembly constituency, took place outside the Veermata Jijabai Bhosale Botanical Udyan and Zoo — popularly known as Rani Baug — where the chicks were born earlier this year.“When penguins were brought from abroad to the Veermata Jijabai Bhosale Botanical Udyan and Zoo, we accepted that their names would be in English.However, Penguin chicks born here, on the soil of Maharashtra, should be given Marathi names,” Bankar said.He claimed that repeated appeals to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), which runs the zoo, had gone unheard.The zoo had named the chicks Noddy, Tom, and Pingu — continuing a tradition of English names that began when the first batch of Humboldt penguins arrived from South Korea in 2016.Bankar said the protest was not just about naming animals, but also about recognising Marathi’s classical language status.“We stood firm on our demand, but it was ignored.I had even written to the BMC administration, but no one responded,” he said.The penguin chicks were born to two penguin couples in March, zoo officials said. The first, Popeye and Olive, welcomed Noddy on 3 March. Daisy and Donald had two hatchlings — Tom on 7 March and Pingu on 11 March. This was the first successful batch of chicks at the zoo in over a year.“Tom gets his name to complement Jerry, a chick hatched in June 2023,” an official explained. “Tom, being the elder sibling, often gets more food regurgitated by the parents. We end up feeding Pingu.”The chicks are being cared for by their parents and monitored by zoo staff. “The babies are expected to start exploring the pool area once they are about three months old,” said Dr Abhishek Satam, biologist at the zoo.The hatchings have brought the total number of Humboldt penguins at the facility to 21. Zoo officials said they were fast-tracking expansion plans for the enclosure, which currently houses up to 25 birds. The proposed expansion — an additional 400 square feet — will increase capacity to around 40 penguins.With most of the birds now around 6–7 years old and able to breed until the age of 15, the zoo anticipates more additions in the coming years.The facility has drawn praise for its success in breeding the species in Indian conditions, officials said.","The protest was led by BJP functionary Nitin Bankar from the Byculla assembly constituency.
