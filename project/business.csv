The plan is to bring all packaged items sold in the retail market under the ambit of the rule. Packaged commodities meant for industrial and institutional consumers will be exempted from this provision,” said an official.Mandatory packaging norms have been a key feature as these provide necessary details for consumers to take informed decisions before any purchase.The department said the amendments will help manufacturers, packers and importers of packaged commodities of any quantity to make declarations.","Till now, items sold in the retail market in packages weighing up to 25 kg were covered under this provision.

OBC Creamy Layer: OBC Creamy Layer Income Cap Revision Status and Controversy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/obc-creamy-layer-income-cap-revision-status-and-controversy/articleshow/111738531.cms,"NEW DELHI: The controversy about alleged misrepresentation of ‘non-creamy layer’ certificate by trainee IAS Pooja Khedkar has cast a cloud over the ‘ OBC creamy layer ’ criteria and its implementation. But the irony is that genuine backward aspirants are getting a rough deal and desperately hoping that the new BJP govt will finally wake up to the long pending revision of ‘creamy layer’ for Mandal reservations.The increase in ‘ income ceiling ’ for 27% OBC quotas is pending for seven years, which has made it twice overdue for a hike. It is supposed to be revised every three years to adjust for inflation. The ‘creamy layer’, last revised from Rs 6 lakh to Rs 8 lakh in 2017, is the group of backwards who are categorised as well-off among the OBCs and thus ineligible for job and education quotas.All India OBC Employees Federation general secretary G Karunanidhy said during the seven years, the Union govt has revised the salary structure of its employees and increased their dearness allowance (DA) from 24% to 46% till July 2023, and ignoring these indexes for income ceiling for reservation is unjustified. “The new central govt has settled in. We demand immediate revision of income ceiling for creamy layer to Rs 15 lakh,” he said.When the income ceiling was due for an increase in 2020, the Union social justice ministry moved a cabinet proposal recommending it be hiked from Rs 8 lakh to Rs 12 lakh, but added a separate point to redefine the ‘income criteria’ for the ‘creamy layer’. As laid down by the post-Mandal 1993 office memorandum, ‘income’ does not include ‘salary’ and ‘agricultural earnings’, but govt proposed that in future ‘salary’ be included in calculating ‘income’.The proposal ran into resistance from the National Commission for Backward Classes and senior OBC leaders of BJP, who argued that inclusion of ‘salary’ in calculating the ‘creamy layer’ would make it easier for a backward to be considered better-off. A surprised Modi govt was forced to put the proposal in cold storage.The deadlock dragged on for three years and in Sept 2023, the revision became due again. Meanwhile, the social justice minister told the Lok Sabha on Feb 7, 2023, that there was no proposal for revision “since the existing income limit is considered sufficient”, triggering outrage among the backwards.Now, with two hikes overdue, social justice activists like Karunanidhy, who have sent several letters to govt, complain it has become much easier for an OBC to be weeded out of eligibility for reservations because Rs 8 lakh is too low a ceiling in 2024, seven years after it was determined.","The increase in ‘ income ceiling ’ for 27% OBC quotas is pending for seven years. It is supposed to be revised every three years to adjust for inflation.

NEW DELHI: Probationary IAS officer Puja Khedkar , in the eye of a storm over the authenticity of her disability and OBC status claims that got her appointed to the civil services, could face termination of service and even criminal charges of forgery if the one-man panel set by the Centre to probe the matter finds any misrepresentation or suppression of facts on her part.Sources in the government said the panel of DoPT additional secretary Manoj Dwivedi will, over the next two weeks, probe how she obtained the documents establishing her disability and OBC status, and whether proper vetting was carried out by the issuing authority.Khedkar is said to have recurrently failed to appear for mandatory medical tests at AIIMS Delhi to confirm her disability, despite having qualified for IAS in the ‘Persons with Benchmark Disabilities (PwBD)’ category.“The panel will submit its findings to DoPT which will then forward the report with recommendations to the Maharashtra government, since she is allocated to the Maharashtra cadre. If found guilty of forging her OBC and disability papers, the state government could terminate her. Also, she may face criminal liability for forgery and misrepresentation,” a source said.The DoPT panel looking into Khedkar’s claims is likely to take the help of social justice ministry to verify her OBC status. Although she claims to be from the economically weaker category, the affidavit filed by her father, an ex-bureaucrat and a candidate in the recent Lok Sabha polls, declared his assets at over Rs 40 crore. Khedkar was shown as the owner of flats and plots worth crores.The panel will, in consultation with experts from AIIMS Delhi, also examine if the visual and mental disability claimed by her meets the benchmarks for employment in the government.A senior government functionary said this was not the first case of a civil services aspirant making incorrect disability claims for selection in the PwBD category. “There are instances almost every year when those selected on the basis of false disability claims have evaded the mandatory medical test at AIIMS Delhi and even escalated the matter to the Central Administrative Tribunal seeking testing elsewhere.

(With reports from agencies)

NEW DELHI: In more trouble for IAS probationary officer Puja Khedkar , Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) officials have issued a notice of illegal encroachment at her residence. According to the PMC's Encroachment Department, Khedkar's residence had unauthorised construction or obstructions on public roads or footpaths under the corporation's jurisdiction.While the details of Khedkar's specific case are not publicly known, the PMC's encroachment removal process typically involves issuing notices, conducting surveys, and ultimately demolishing or clearing the illegal structures if the owner fails to comply.Khedkar has found herself in the middle of a massive controversy over alleged misuse of power and privileges.Officials said all documents presented by her to secure her candidature in the civil services examination and then for selection in the service will be re-examined by a single-member committee constituted by the Centre on Thursday.She may be terminated from service if found guilty, said officials.""The officer may be terminated from the service if found guilty.

There must be some material against the person before proceedings under the law can be initiated, it stressed.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Ahsanuddin Amanullah held that ""in the absence of the basic/primary material, it cannot be left to the untrammelled or arbitrary discretion of the authorities to initiate proceedings"", which have life-altering and very serious consequences for the person.It said, Section 9 could not be invoked on the basis of hearsay or bald and vague allegation(s).""...the question is that does Section 9 of the Act empower the executive to pick a person at random, knock at his/her/their door, tell him/her/they/them 'We suspect you of being a foreigner'?... Obviously, the State cannot proceed in such a manner. Neither can we as a court countenance such an approach,"" the bench observed, while setting aside the order of the Foreigners Tribunal and Gauhati high court declaring a person from Assam an illegal Bangladeshi migrant.The bench accepted the submission of advocate Kaushik Choudhury who, appearing for the petitioner, submitted that Section 9 could not be used arbitrarily and settled principles of natural justice could not be given a go-by.""It needs no reiteration that a person charged or accused would generally not be able to prove to the negative, if he/she is not aware of the evidence/material against him/her which leads to the person being labelled suspect. Ipso facto just an allegation/accusation cannot lead to shifting of the burden to the accused, unless he/she is confronted with the allegation as also the material backing such allegation,"" the court said.The court said that there was no material in possession of authority which could raise suspicion on his nationality. After fighting a legal battle for two decades, SC came to his rescue and declared him Indian as all his relatives were also declared Indian citizens. The court also said that minor spelling mistakes in names on official documents could not be the sole reason to deny authenticity as happened in the case.""However, mere allegation, that too, being as vague as to mechanically reproduce simply the words which mirror the text of provisions in the Act cannot be permitted under law.

Controversial Trainee IAS Pooja Khedkar's Mock Interview Goes Viral | Watch

PUNE: Probationary IAS officer Puja Khedkar , embroiled in a controversy over the legitimacy of her certificates, secured MBBS admission to Pune’s Shrimati Kashibai Navale Medical College and General Hospital in 2007 under the reserved nomadic tribe-3 category furnishing a non-creamy layer OBC certificate, college director Arvind Bhore said Saturday.Khedkar gained admission through the Association of Management of Unaided Private Medical and Dental Colleges of Maharashtra (AMUPMDC) entrance test, scoring 146 out of 200, said Bhore. AMUPMDC no longer exists after NEET’s introduction.Khedkar is under multiple investigations for submitting a non-creamy layer certificate to UPSC, despite owning properties worth at least Rs 17 crore, including family gifts. Her selection under the benchmark disabilities category is also under review.According to Bhore, it was the medical college’s first batch when Khedkar joined. “Khedkar had also attempted the Maharashtra common entrance test for medical admissions. But her AMUPMDC score was higher than the state CET. She had provided a non-creamy layer certificate of the NT-3 category of the Vanjari community at the time of admission. We checked all the documents at the time of submission and found them to be authentic govt records,” Bhore said.Khedkar’s non-creamy layer certificate was issued by Pathardi sub-divisional office in Ahmednagar in 2007. Her caste and validity certificates were also issued by the same office, according to college records. Bhore mentioned she did not submit any disability certificate at the time of admission.When TOI contacted Khedkar, her cellphone was switched off. She also hadn’t responded to text messages till the time of going to press.College records indicate Khedkar scored 83% in Class 10 and 74% in Class 12 state board exams. She earned her MBBS degree in 2011-12 after completing academics and internship at Navale College. During her internship, she was stationed at the community medicine department.“Her conduct was fine and she passed all her semesters with ease while her internship at the hospital was also completed on time,” Bhore said.","Pooja Khedkar secured MBBS admission to Pune’s Shrimati Kashibai Navale Medical College and General Hospital in 2007 under the reserved nomadic tribe-3 category.

Out of 1,000 CUET-UG aspirants for whom National Testing Agency (NTA) is conducting a retest on July 19, 250 candidates are from Oasis Public School in Hazaribag. According to NTA sources, the retest is necessary due to the distribution of question papers in a language not chosen by the candidates and issues with ""missing data"" for some aspirants.The agency announced the retest schedule on Sunday but did not address the delay in the results, which are already over two weeks late. The final answer key has also not been released. The official notification on Sunday stated that grievances submitted by candidates up to June 30, and complaints sent to rescuetug@nta.ac.in between July 7-9 (before 05.00pm) have been reviewed. The re-examination will be conducted for the affected candidates on July 19 in computer-based test mode.The public notice did not specify the number of candidates or the nature of the grievances. However, sources indicate multiple issues, including ""missing data"" for some aspirants. According to NTA sources, the ""1,000 candidates are spread across six states, and some grievances include time lost due to the distribution of the wrong question paper.""The distribution of incorrect question papers also occurred during the NEET-UG exam on May 5, leading NTA to grant grace marks for the lost time. However, following opposition and pleas in Supreme Court against the inflation of marks, NTA withdrew the results and announced retest for 1,563 candidates, 813 of whom attended the exam on June 23.Sources also mentioned that NTA has not been able to retrieve data for some candidates. ""Some data are missing, so these candidates will have to take the test again on July 19"", said the source, without revealing how the data was misplaced.This raises questions about how long NTA will take to release the results. Initially scheduled for June 30, the results were delayed due to the paper leak allegations involving NEET-UG, and UGC-NET. On July 7, the agency released the provisional answer key for CUET-UG 2024, indicating a retest for candidates if grievances were validated. ""Initially, it was decided to announce the results for the remaining candidates before the retest, and subsequently for the rest. However, a final decision is yet to be made,"" said the source, indicating further uncertainty.Delhi University has already indicated that a three-week delay in results would delay the university's academic calendar by two weeks.

Should we stop at this point, or proceed further to find out why the driver was overtaking from the left? Why was he (driver) speeding? Was it a time table issue? What about standards for buses?

The atmosphere was charged with a mix of apprehension and enthusiasm among the devotees during the opening of the treasury inside the Puri Jagannath Temple .Many devotees visited Puri to witness the historic event apart from paying obeisance to the sibling deities at the Gundicha Temple. Curious pilgrims were standing in front of the Jagannath Temple to witness an array of activities on the occasion of the inventory of the treasury.There were restrictions for people to enter the Jagannath Temple before the 11-member team entered to open the Ratna Bhandar. When new wooden chests were being taken to the Jagannath Temple, people could not resist taking photographs of the chests. They were inquiring from people standing in front of the temple about the chests.Ranjan Kumar Swain, a devotee from Nayagarh, expressed his happiness over the opening of Ratna Bhandar. “We have been eagerly waiting for the day. All Odias should know the condition of the treasury of Lord Jagannath. I have come all the way from Nayagarh to witness the event,” said the youth.Bimala Mohapatra, a senior citizen from Dhenkanal, said the inventory of the Lord’s treasury should be done in a transparent and systematic way. “I am feeling happy that Ratna Bhandar is opened for repairing and inventory. Lord Jagannath is our identity, and we are proud of our Lord,” she added.Abhisek Das, an activist, said he had filed a PIL in the Orissa High Court in 2016 to open Ratna Bhandar. “In 2018, the high court had issued an order in favor of us. But the inventory process could not be started during the previous government because of the loss of the key to Ratna Bhandar’s inside room. I am happy that this new government has implemented the high court order. It’s a dream come true moment for Odias like me,” he added.Some foreigners and non-Odias were among the curious devotees near the Puri Jagannath Temple. They were also witnessing the hustle and bustle outside the temple. “I have come to Puri for the Rath Yatra festival. When I knew about the opening of Ratna Bhandar of the sibling deities, I stayed back to feel the vibe outside the temple.

If the works are found to be sub-standard, the entire stretch should be relaid at the concerned contractor’s expense. No extra funds should be released for repairing damaged road stretches,” Desai said.It may be noted that several stretches of roads develop damages within days of being repaired during the monsoon following which the concerned department and agencies end up spending additional money to fill up the potholes. The issue was also raised recently by chief minister Eknath Shinde after a senior former bureaucrat was recently stuck in slow-moving traffic on Nashik highway due to potholes.Meanwhile, a plan to install GPS systems on all ambulances operating in Thane to keep tabs on their movements was also discussed. Shiv Sena MP Shrikant Shinde said often patients don’t get ambulances on time leading to loss of valuable time. “There is a need for a unified network where locations of these vehicles could be tracked via GPS and conveyed on a dashboard which could help dispatch the nearest vans to patients in time,” said Shinde.","Contractors undertaking pothole filling works on highways and city stretches will now be asked to bear the cost of fresh repairs.

"World population to peak at 10.3b by 2080s, life expectancy returns to pre-Covid levels : UN report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/world-population-to-peak-at-10-3b-by-2080s-life-expectancy-returns-to-pre-covid-levels-un-report/articleshow/111669844.cms,"NEW DELHI: The world’s population is expected to peak within the current century to reach around 10.3 billion people in the mid-2080s, up from 8.2 billion in 2024. After peaking, it is projected to start declining, gradually falling to 10.2 billion by the end of the century.While in 63 countries, like China and Japan, population peaked before 2024, India and the US are placed among 126 countries where the peak is expected in the second half of the century or beyond 2100.Significantly, one in four people live in a country whose population has already peaked.These findings, part of the ‘ World Population Prospects 2024’ report released by the UN on Thursday, also highlight that since 2022, life expectancy has returned to pre-Covid levels in nearly all countries and areas. After a brief decline during the pandemic, global life expectancy at birth has reached 73.3 years in 2024 (an increase of 8.4 years since 1995) up from 70.9 years during the pandemic.“Further reductions in mortality are projected to result in an average longevity of around 77.4 years globally in 2054. By the late 2050s, more than half of all global deaths will occur at age 80 or higher, a substantial increase from 17% in 1995,” the report shows.By the late 2070s, the number of persons at ages 65 years and higher globally is projected to reach 2.2 billion, surpassing the number of children (under age 18). By the mid-2030s, it is projected that there will be 265 million persons aged 80 years or older, more than the number of infants (1 year of age or less).Even in countries that are still growing rapidly and have relatively youthful populations, the number of persons aged 65 or older is expected to rise over the next 30 years.According to a press statement released from New York, the analysis in the report prepared by the Population Division of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA) shows that the size of the world’s population in 2100 is now expected to be 6% lower — or 700 million fewer — than anticipated a decade ago according to the ‘World Population Prospects 2024’ report released by the UN on Thursday.In 63 countries and areas, containing 28% of the world’s population in 2024, the size of the population peaked before 2024. This category includes countries like China, Germany, Japan and the Russian Federation, and the total population of this group is projected to decline by 14% over the next thirty years.For another 48 countries with 10% of the world’s population, including Brazil, Iran, Türkiye and Vietnam, the population is projected to peak between 2025 and 2054.In the remaining 126 countries, including India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan and the United States of America, the population is expected to increase through 2054 and, potentially, to peak in the second half of the century or beyond 2100.In nine countries of this last group, including Angola, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Niger and Somalia, very rapid growth is projected, with their total population doubling between 2024 and 2054.The report highlights that rapid fertility declines in populous countries is a likely cause for the global population to peak within this century (80%), contrasting with a decade ago when the probability was around 30%.“The demographic landscape has evolved greatly in recent years,"" said Li Junhua, UN Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs. ""In some countries, the birth rate is now even lower than previously anticipated, and we are also seeing slightly faster declines in some high-fertility regions. The earlier and lower peak is a hopeful sign. This could mean reduced environmental pressures from human impacts due to lower aggregate consumption,” Junhua added.“The earlier population peak is due to several factors, including lower levels of fertility in some of the world’s largest countries, especially China. Globally, women are having one child fewer, on average, than they did around 1990,” the analysis shows.The data brings into focus that in more than half of all countries, the average number of live births per woman is below 2.1—the level required for a population to maintain a constant size over the long term without migration—and nearly a fifth of all countries and areas, including China, Italy, the Republic of Korea and Spain, now have “ultra-low” fertility, with fewer than 1.4 live births per woman over a lifetime.On what the journey onwards is expected to look like, the report states that the main driver of global population increase through mid-century will be the momentum created by growth in the past. ""The number of women at ages 15–49 is projected to grow from nearly 2 billion in 2024 to a peak of around 2.2 billion in the late 2050s, driving continued growth even if the number of births per woman falls to the replacement level."" Moreover, today’s youthful age structure, which is a product of past growth, will account for 79% of the population increase through 2054, adding about 1.4 billion people.The analysis also shows that the countries with youthful populations and declining fertility have a limited time to benefit economically from an increasing concentration of population in the working ages. ""In about 100 countries or areas, the working-age population (between 20 and 64 years) will grow through 2054, offering a window of opportunity known as the demographic dividend,"" the UN report states and recommends that to capitalize on this opportunity, countries must invest in education, health, and infrastructure, and implement reforms to create jobs and improve government efficiency.For some populations, immigration will be the main driver of future growth. ""In 50 countries and areas, immigration is projected to attenuate the decline in population size due to sustained low levels of fertility and an older age structure. However, in 14 countries and areas already experiencing ultra-low fertility, emigration is likely to contribute to reducing population size through 2054,"" the report states.The data also shows that early pregnancies remain a challenge, particularly in low-income countries. In 2024, 4.7 million babies, or about 3.5% of the total worldwide, were born to mothers under age 18 – and some 340,000, to girls under age 15 – with serious consequences for the health and well-being of both the young mothers and their children.The UN calls for investing in the education of youth, especially girls, and increasing the ages at marriage and first childbearing in countries where these milestone events tend to occur early will have positive effects on women’s health, educational attainment and labour force participation. ""These efforts will also contribute to slowing population growth and reducing the scale of the investments required to achieve sustainable development while ensuring that no one is left behind,"" the report asserts.","The world’s population is expected to peak within the current century to reach around 10.3 billion people in the mid-2080s. After peaking, it is projected to start declining, gradually falling to 10.2 billion by the end of the century. In 63 countries, like China and Japan, population peaked before 2024, India and the US are placed among 126 countries where the peak is expected in the second half of thecentury or beyond 2100.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111669848,imgsize-2260147,width-400,resizemode-4/111669848.jpg"

Valmiki corporation scam: ED detains former Karnataka minister B Nagendra in money laundering case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/valmiki-corporation-scam-ed-detains-ex-karnataka-minister-b-nagendra-in-money-laundering-case/articleshow/111677673.cms,"Ex-Karnataka Minister B Nagendra

BENGALURU: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Friday detained former Karnataka Minister B Nagendra on Friday in connection with the alleged Valmiki Development Corporation scam.This action followed raids conducted by the ED on Wednesday at various locations linked to Nagendra and MLA Basanagouda Daddal, concerning the alleged embezzlement of funds from Valmiki Development Corporation.Nagendra, who had resigned on June 6 amid the ongoing investigation, has professed his innocence, asserting he would be cleared of all allegations through the investigation process.Union Minister and BJP MP Shobha Karandlaje has implicated Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah in the scam, demanding his resignation.She stated, ""On July 3, I wrote to the Union Home Minister and demanded a CBI probe into this. When the CBI probe is going on, the Karnataka government formed an SIT to hide this scam . Now the SIT is not helping the CBI, but the probe is going on and the ED conducted raids. At various places, searches are being conducted in Hyderabad, Bengaluru, and Bellary. The Karnataka CM is involved in this, so we demand the resignation of Siddaramaiah. He should resign and face the probe then only justice will be delivered.""Shobha Karandlaje further explained, ""Siddaramaiah is the Finance Minister. Without his instructions, no one will have the courage to transfer Rs 187 crores from the bank to companies.""In response to the ED raids , Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister stated that the raids were unnecessary, emphasizing that the Special Investigation Team (SIT) had already conducted thorough investigations and recovered the money.He said, ""There was no need for ED raid. Our SIT officers have already done an investigation and money has been recovered. CBI have already filed an FIR and they have provisions to take up the investigation, ED doesn't have that provision. There is a procedure for how it can be done, not on NR Ramesh or somebody's complaint ED can do an investigation.""The controversy surrounding the Maharshi Valmiki Scheduled Tribes Development Corporation first came to light after the suicide of an official, Chandrasekaran, on May 26. Chandrasekaran, a resident of Kenchappa colony in Vinobanagar and a superintendent at the Corporation's Bengaluru office, left behind a six-page suicide note alleging multi-crore corruption within the Corporation and naming three officials involved.This note prompted investigations, with Chandrasekaran's allegations drawing widespread attention. The ED raids and subsequent detention of Nagendra have added further intensity to the case, raising serious questions about the governance and integrity of the Valmiki Development Corporation and its officials.The SIT’s prior intervention and the ED's involvement place a spotlight on potential overlaps or conflicts between state mechanisms like the SIT and central agencies like the CBI and ED. This complex interaction underscores the broad impacts of corruption allegations and the administrative responses elicited at various government levels.The ongoing investigations and their outcomes will likely have significant implications for political and administrative accountability in Karnataka, with particular focus on the roles and responsibilities of high-ranking officials within the state’s finance and development sectors.As the situation unfolds, the ED, CBI, and SIT continue their respective probes into the matter, which remains a hotbed of political and legal activity. The ultimate findings will determine the veracity of the claims and the extent of involvement by key figures, including those at the highest levels of the state government.","The Enforcement Directorate (ED) detained former Karnataka Minister B Nagendra on Friday in connection with the alleged Valmiki Development Corporation scam.

This Year Will Lead To Lesser

Cut-Off

With fewer students inching past the 195 cut-off mark this year in the rank list and engineering colleges adding 25,000 more seats, the cut-off is likely to go down for top engineering colleges this year.As many as 65 students scored 200 of 200 marks in the engineering rank list released on Wednesday.Of these, 58 were from the state board and seven from other boards. Last year, 102 students scored full marks.Thosithaa Lakshmi N from Chengalpet, Nilanjana K from Tirunelveli and Gokul from Rasipuram secured the first three ranks in the engineering rank list.“The number of students scoring above 195 has come down from 2,911 last year to 2,862 this year. Due to a big increase in the intake of seats by colleges, the cut-off may come down by up to one mark for top colleges compared to last year,” career consultant Jayaprakash Gandhi said.In the 150 to 180 marks bracket, the cut-off may rise by up to eight marks as more than 15,000 students have scored in this range this year, he added. However, engineering colleges said students who scored below 180 cut-off marks have a bright chance to get admitted to top colleges.“With more seats available this year, we can expect students with below 180 cut-off marks can join reputed colleges this year,” said B Chidambarajan, director, SRM Valliammai Engineering College.Earlier, K Veera Raghava Rao, commissioner, directorate of technical education (DOTE) released the engineering rank list and the schedule for admissions. This year, 1,99,868 students feature in the rank list.“The number of students in the engineering rank list has increased by 11.7% compared to previous year. We will release the list of colleges with seat matrix by July 15 on TNEA website,” he said.Engineering counselling will begin on July 22 for special categories. The online general counselling will be conducted in three rounds from July 29 to September 3.Engineering colleges have submitted applications to the fee committee to revise the tuition fee for govt quota seats and management quota seats for 2024-25.As of now, engineering colleges collect Rs 85,000 for management quota (Rs 87,000 for accredited courses) and Rs 50,000 for government quota seats (Rs 55,000 for accredited courses). A few top colleges were allowed to collect Rs 1.25 lakh for management quota seats after they submitted their balance sheet with the fee committee.","As many as 65 students scored 200 of 200 marks in the engineering rank list released on Wednesday.

Still stuck in Space: What astronaut Sunita Williams said about her return to Earth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/still-stuck-in-space-what-astronaut-sunita-williams-said-about-her-return-to-earth/articleshow/111648877.cms,"Two American astronauts , Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams , who are currently waiting to depart from the International Space Station , expressed their confidence on Wednesday that the Boeing Starliner spacecraft they arrived on would safely bring them back to Earth, despite the significant uncertainties surrounding the vehicle's performance.The astronauts launched on June 5 aboard the new spaceship, which Nasa hopes to certify for transporting crews to and from the space station.However, their return has been delayed due to thruster malfunctions and helium leaks that were discovered during the journey.Although no specific date has been set for their return, Nasa officials indicated on Wednesday that they are targeting ""late July.""When asked during a press conference from the station if they still had faith in the Starliner team and the spacecraft, mission commander Wilmore responded, ""We're absolutely confident."" Williams added, ""I have a real good feeling in my heart that the spacecraft will bring us home, no problem.""The astronauts have been keeping themselves busy on the ISS, carrying out various tasks and experiments, such as changing the pump on a machine that recycles urine into drinking water and conducting gene sequencing in microgravity.Before Wilmore and Williams can return to Earth, engineering teams need to conduct more simulations on the ground to better understand the root causes of the technical issues Starliner experienced and modify the spacecraft's flight plan if necessary.The spacecraft had a known helium leak before launch, but additional leaks emerged during the flight. Additionally, some of Starliner's thrusters, which provide fine maneuvering, initially failed to engage during its approach to the station, delaying docking. Engineers are still investigating the reasons behind these issues.Despite the challenges, Nasa and Boeing maintain that Starliner could safely return to Earth in case of an emergency, particularly since the problems affected only certain orientation-controlling thrusters. They have no concerns about the more powerful thrusters responsible for the ""deorbit burn"" that will bring the spaceship back.However, much remains uncertain, including whether the malfunctioning thrusters have become degraded, which would necessitate relying on other thrusters during descent.","Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams are currently waiting to depart from the International Space Station.

Among many international celebrities spotted at the grand wedding ceremonies of business tycoon Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant ,WWE star John Cena too arrived in style and had the photographers going gaga over his presence in Mumbai. The 16 time WWE World champion was even seen shaking a leg in joy.The future WWE Hall of famer famously known as ‘The Champ’, arrived at Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant's Grand wedding in Mumbai.The 47 year old who is also a Hollywood movie star for the past 5 years, arrived on July 12th for the wedding. Previously, Cena touched down in Mumbai wearing a casual outfit. The wedding took place at the Nita Ambani Cultural Centre, Mumbai. He was cheered and clicked by the fans in huge numbers outside the airport amidst heavy security.Several International celebrities like Kim Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian, Justin Bieber, Rihanna, etc have all been a part of this grand wedding and its festivities going on in the last few months. It has been the talk of the town and regarded as one of the biggest and most awaited wedding ceremonies across the globe. The WWE legend, Cena was seen striking his signature ‘You Can't See Me’ pose in a light blue 'Sherwani' after arriving at the wedding place. He was seen in a jovial mood all throughout.During all this, the moment that took everyone by surprise was seeing Cena shake a leg and dance vigorously at the ‘Baraat’ ceremony that takes place specially for the groom. It looked like John was enjoying his time at the wedding thoroughly and did not hesitate one bit even from shaking his leg when asked by the friends of the groom. It was the rarest of the rare sights for the wrestling and Hollywood fans across the world.John Cena has recently been in the news globally since he shocked the world last week at Money in the Bank Premium Live Event by announcing his retirement from wrestling after WrestleMania 41 is done with. Millions of fans have gone emotional after this announcement from Cena.

The WWE has given us some truly iconic moments over its last 70 years of entertainment. Throughout the last seven decades, we have witnessed some of the greatest wrestlers in the ring battle it out for championship belts. However, not every WWE legend is created equal. There are a few who stand out, even among the brightest stars of the game.There are some whose brilliance sets them apart, even when they're grouped with legends.Today, we’ll be taking a look at the Top 10 WWE Legends of all time.If it wasn’t for the greatness of Hulk Hogan , WWE, and all its various businesses might not be where they are today. Hogan stood together with Vince McMahon and helped him expand the WWE brand. His larger-than-life persona helped McMahon sneak his wrestling promotion into the homes of millions. Throughout his career, Hogan won the WWE Championship six times and toppled legends like Andre the Giant, Roddy Piper, and Randy Savage.Even after an eight-year absence, Hogan returned for Wrestlemania X-8 and gave one of the best performances ever against The Rock . His longevity and ability to win crowds is what makes him a WWE Legend. Hogan made his debut back in 1977 and is still celebrated as one of the best wrestlers to ever grace the ring. We might never see a star who can pull in the masses as effectively as Hogan could at the peak of his career.John Cena has been the WWE Champion a total of 16 times. He arrived in 2002 and completely burst onto the scene by deciding to challenge former WWE superstar Kurt Angle in his first ever appearance. However, despite his hot start, Cena might’ve fizzled out if the company hadn’t found him rapping on buses.Thanks to his skills on the mic, the Thuganomics era began, and Cena was unstoppable. John Cena started with awkward raps full of witty insults and used that to become the face of the company. The crowd just couldn’t get enough of him, and his rapid ascent took Cena to his first WWE title back in 2005.It’s been 19 years since then, and he's still going strong. John Cena has taken on legends like The Rock, Randy Orton, Shawn Michaels, Triple H, and more throughout his decade-long reign at the top of WWE. Next year, Cena’s time in the ring will come to an end, he’s already one of the best to ever do it and will surely be giving us some historic moments as he prepares for his final run.The Undertaker is easily one of the greatest wrestlers of all time and for a man who doesn’t speak often, he is also one of the best showmen the WWE has ever seen. He was so loved by the crowd that it only took him a year to beat Hulk Hogan and become the WWE Champion. His zombie-like fighting style and his supernatural character were loved by the fans.What truly made The Undertaker great wasn’t the belts he won, it was the stories he delivered. From his scuffle with Kane to his Hell in a Cell bout with Mankind and even his entire row with Randy Orton, the Undertaker has always given us some of the best stories in the WWE. He even strung together 21 Wrestlemania victories in a row until Brock Lesnar somehow toppled the giant at Wrestlemania XXX.There aren’t many who can electrify an arena like The Rock. He arrived to the WWE as a third-generation wrestler, and the expectations were high. If he hadn’t found his way to the Nation of Domination, we might not have been able to witness his greatness. However, The Rock was able to completely reinvent his character, and his mic skills did all the rest.Within two years of his debut, The Rock won the WWE Championship at Survivor Series. Since then, he’s won the belt a total of eight times, solidifying himself as one of the greatest of all time. Rock has taken on and beat legends like Steve Austin, Shawn Michaels, John Cena, Triple H, and many more. He more than deserves to be counted among the greatest WWE legends.“Stone Cold” Steve Austin is the reason WWE was able to outlast WCW in the Monday Night Wars. If it weren’t for the antihero persona of Austin, WWE, as we know it, might have looked completely different. No one expected Austin to be a success, but as it turns out, a wrestler who doesn’t care about authority, flips everyone off and drinks beer in the ring was all the rage back in the 1990s.His shenanigans in the ring and rivalry against McMahon saw Austin rise to the top of WWE. He beat Shawn Michaels at Wrestlemania XIV and etched his name into the history books by becoming the WWE Champion. Since then, we’ve seen Stone Cold turn heel and partner with McMahon on his way to five more championships. The Stone Cold Stunner outlined an era of WWE greatness and will go down as one of the best ever.Randy Savage the Macho Man is one of the most entertaining wrestlers to ever step into the ring. He brought life to the storylines he played a part in. His rivalries against Hulk Hogan, Ricky Steamboat, Ric Flair, and more legends like the Ultimate Warrior go on to show, just how big of a star he was.Savage chose his wife, Miss Elizabeth, to manage him, and what a decision that was. The amount of legendary moments we’ve had due to Savage being jealous of his wife is enough to get him to the Hall of Fame. Even today, Savage’s image is used to advertise products for Slim Jim all around the world. Randy Savage is a timeless hero and a legend of the game.Not many expected a wrestler of Shawn’s size and build to become the WWE Champion, yet Michaels did it three times. After his relationship with Marty Jannetty came to an end, Michaels was dubbed the Heartbreak Kid and the rest is history. He kept working and took out some of the best competitors in the business like John Cena, Chris Jericho, Rey Mysterio , and many more.Michaels also gave us one of the best Wrestlemania performances of all time at Wrestlemania XXV against The Undertaker. The Deadman won the day, but Michaels reminded the people that he’s one of the best wrestlers this brand has ever seen. Today, Michaels helps Ava run WWE NXT. Even after stepping out of the ring, Shawn is working on bringing new talents to the fans at home.We said that not many people expected someone of Shawn Michaels’ size to become WWE Champion, and this is even more true in the case of Rey Mysterio. Rey has never been able to tower over an opponent throughout his lengthy WWE career. However, his athleticism has allowed him to reach the pinnacle of WWE by winning three world championships.At the peak of his career, Mysterio was facing off against the likes of Eddie Guerrero and Kurt Angle. Mysterio left the company after more than a decade of greatness. Upon his return in 2019, he continued to impress, and his legend only grew. Even now, Rey continues to give us some amazing storylines, facing off against Seth Rollins, Roman Reigns and his own son, Dominik Mysterio.Before Mysterio won the Royal Rumble match in 2006, the world thought it'd be impossible for a man of his size to achieve such a thing. However, Mysterio made a career out of proving people wrong, and he did so tons of times on his way to multiple championship belts.Ultimate Warrior was pure energy every time he stepped into the WWE ring. Everything from his fae paint to the arm bands and his toned muscles made the people believe that The Ultimate Warrior was a force of nature. Thanks to his out-of-this-world presence and personality, he was able to reach the pinnacle of the WWE world and battled with the likes of Randy Savage, Hulk Hogan, and Rick Dude.Ultimate Warrior’s reputation among his fellow stars might not be spotless, but his savagery and skills in the ring sure were. The Ultimate Warrior is a Hall of Famer and is easily one of the best competitors the WWE has ever seen.Ever since Bret Hard took his leave, the WWE has not seen a showman who can even be compared to him. The Hitman was a master of his trade and made a career out of selling his fights on realism. Hart was a true champion and had the pride and ego of one as well. Thankfully, he also had the skills and quality to win over the hearts of the fans.Throughout his career, Hart faced off against many legends like Ric Flair, Steve Austin, The Undertaker, and Shawn Michaels. Whoever he faced became a bigger and better star thanks to the impact Bret Hart had on his peers. It can also be said that it was Bret Hart himself who paved the way for smaller wrestlers like Shawn Michaels. Many consider the Hitman to be the greatest wrestler ever, and an argument can surely be made for the five-time WWE Champion. The WWE would look a lot different without all those who were inspired by the brilliance of The Hitman.","The WWE has given us some truly iconic moments over its last 70 years of entertainment. Not every WWE legend is created equal, even among the brightest stars of the game. There are some whose brilliance sets them apart, even when they're grouped with legends. Here are the Top 10 WWE Legends of all time.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111664815,imgsize-3299136,width-400,resizemode-4/111664815.jpg"

Was Udham Singh at Jallianwala Bagh on day of massacre? Book reignites debate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/was-udham-singh-at-jallianwala-bagh-on-day-of-massacre-book-reignites-debate/articleshow/111737543.cms,"Jallianwala Bagh (File photo)

CHANDIGARH: The curious case of a school textbook in Punjab suggesting that one of India's celebrated freedom fighters, 'Shaheed' Sardar Udham Singh , wasn't anywhere near Amritsar on April 13, 1919 - the day of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre - has ignited sentiments in his native state that go beyond challenging this alleged historical untruth.Generations have grown up hearing and reading about how Udham Singh, who would go on to ""avenge"" the massacre of innocents two decades later, tended to those wounded at Jallianwala Bagh hours after the carnage and also helped a woman find her husband in a heap of bodies.Some accounts mention that he stood over the victims' bodies at Jallianwala Bagh that day and vowed to make it his life's mission to get them justice. He would wait until March 13, 1940, for that moment to arrive.Udham Singh's act of shooting dead Michael O'Dwyer, who was the British lieutenant governor of Punjab at the time of the massacre, in London's packed Caxton Hall and his arrest, conviction and execution thereafter remain one of the more compelling stories of the movement for Independence.Earlier this year, a six-member team from Ferozpur's Shaheed Udham Singh Memorial Society landed in Chandigarh to meet officials of Punjab School Education Board (PSEB) and contest the veracity of the information mentioned in one of its published textbooks.The original version of Punjabi Paath Pustak, a Class IV textbook, states that Udham Singh was abroad when bullets from British soldiers' guns rained on a Baishakhi Day crowd at Jallianwala Bagh protesting the Rowlatt Act and the arrest of freedom fighters Saifuddin Kitchlew and Satyapal.""A textbook published by PSEB says Udham Singh was abroad when the Jallianwala Bagh carnage happened. That's a blatant historical distortion. We have submitted documentary evidence supporting the fact that Udham Singh was present at Jallianwala Bagh that day. Fortunately, PSEB responded positively to our request and decided to amend the chapter,"" Jaspal Handa, a member of Shaheed Udham Singh Memorial Society, told TOI.This isn't the first time that Udham Singh's presence or otherwise at Jallianwala Bagh on April 13, 1919, has been debated. Various books and accounts disagree on this aspect of the massacre episode.In a foreword to B S Maighowalia's 1969 book Sardar Udham Singh: A Prince Amongst Patriots in India, former defence minister V K Krishna Menon writes, ""Sardar Udham Singh, who joined the national movement early in his life, soon parted company with Gandhiji. The key factor in this conversion was the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, which impelled him to rebel against the authority, almost individualistically, but with determination coupled with bitterness.""Menon, who was part of the team that defended Udham Singh during his trial in London, then cites an instance suggesting that the latter's presence at Jallianwala Bagh on the day of the massacre would define his life thereafter.""Sardar Udham Singh was driven to avenge the death of martyrs. The grimmest element in this determination of vengeance seems to have been the acceptance of the request of an Indian woman who had decided to immolate herself at Jallianwala Bagh. But Udham Singh undertook to retrieve the body of the dead husband.""In 1974, Udham Singh's remains, which had been lying in England since his execution in 1940, were brought to India. The same year, Central Khalsa Orphanage, where Udham Singh had spent a part of his childhood, published a Punjabi book on him authored by Suba Singh.Quoting various sources, Suba Singh writes, ""Ratan Devi from Peshawar had also come to Amritsar. But her husband fell victim to the bullets. In the evening, she was wailing and asking for help. Udham Singh heard her voice and went to the place of the massacre along with her. With much difficulty, he located the body of her husband and even retrieved it.""The book also mentions that on April 14, authorities of the orphanage had deputed some youth at the site of the massacre for relief and rescue operations and that Udham Singh was part of it.In one of his books, Dr Sikander Singh, who did his PhD on Udham Singh, writes, ""Udham Singh was also there. He was doing the work of a water carrier.""Martyrs of the Twentieth Century by Giani Gurmukh Singh Musafir states, ""On the day of the massacre, Udham Singh was present in the orphanage. A group of boys from the orphanage was deputed to care for injured people. He was deeply shocked while tending to the victims and pledged to take revenge.""The first challenge to these accounts of Udham Singh being present at Jallianwala Bagh came from a set of British files declassified in 1997.The documents, included in historian Dr Navtej Singh and Avtar Singh Jouhl's 2002 book Emergence of the Image: Redact Documents of Udham Singh, provide detailed information about Udham Singh from his days in Amritsar to his execution in Pentonville prison in England.Accounts of his presence at Jallianwala Bagh on April 13, 1919, were apparently first questioned in the communication dispatched by the then home department to the British secretary of state for India, on June 20, 1940.""Enquiries made in his (Udham Singh's) home village at Sunam in Patiala state and in Amritsar do not confirm his statement that any of their relatives was shot in Amritsar in 1919, or that he was present at Amritsar,"" states the communication.The London-based British authorities purportedly tried to ascertain whether any relative of Udham Singh was at Jallianwala Bagh during the protest that culminated in a tragedy.In response, the home department wrote on April 8, 1940, ""We have no knowledge of any brother or other relative being in Amritsar...His 1927 Amritsar statement to the police, although detailed and accurate in all other aspects, made no mention of either claimant.""The documents also claim that Udham Singh was then working in Africa and returned to India at least two months after the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. After his arrest in London for O'Dwyer's assassination, Udham Singh's initial statement gives the impression that he was not present in Amritsar on April 13, 1919, the papers suggest.Cannon Row police station's A Division noted on March 13, 1940, ""He first left that country (India) during 1918, from Mombasa, East Africa, and worked there as a motor mechanic for a German firm in Nairobi. He could not recollect how long this situation lasted but thinks it was for eighteen months. He says he was sacked for not going to work. He returned to India about June 1919.""Bharat Bhushan, coordinator of the UK-based Shaheed Udham Singh Welfare Trust, told TOI that since all official British files linked to Udham Singh were classified till 1989, writers of books published in the previous decades didn't have access to the important cache of primary sources. ""The contrary fact (about Udham Singh being abroad on the day of the massacre) emerged once the British authorities declassified the documents,"" he said.But so intertwined were the tales of the Jallianwala massacre and Udham Singh that the British ostensibly tried hard to delink his act (of assassinating O'Dwyer) from the massacre. ""The heroic act of the martyr and his apparent link to the massacre was proving uncomfortable for them,"" Bhushan said.A communication between British officials appears to confirm their apprehension, ""The anniversary of Jallianwala Bagh will fall on the 13th April... It would be advisable to avoid holding Udham Singh's trial on this date."""," textbooks say Sardar Udham Singh wasn't at Jallianwala Bagh on April 13, 1919. Singh was one of India's celebrated freedom fighters. He would go on to ""avenge"" the massacre of innocents two decades later.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111737605,imgsize-1910935,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/111737605.jpg"

A consumer court in Karnataka reportedly ruled in favour of a woman who didn't receive her momos order placed through food delivery app Zomato in 2023. According to a report in Indian Express, the order by the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in Dharwad came recently.The woman named Sheethal reportedly placed the order on August 31, 2023, but despite receiving a delivery confirmation, the momos never arrived.Sheethal contacted both the restaurant and Zomato but received no resolution. Zomato requested 72 hours to investigate but never followed up. Left with no choice, Sheethal filed a legal notice against Zomato in September 2023.In court, Zomato denied any wrongdoing. However, the court pointed out that Zomato's inaction for months contradicted their initial request for time to address the issue. Finally, in May 2024, Zomato refunded Sheethal the original cost of the momos (Rs 133.25).The court found Zomato deficient in service and liable for the inconvenience caused to Sheethal. Zomato was ordered to pay Sheethal Rs 50,000 as compensation for the mental stress and Rs 10,000 to cover her legal expenses, bringing the total award to Rs 60,000.“Zomato is carrying out their business of supplying materials in response to the online orders placed by the customer. Despite receipt of the purchase money, Zomato did not deliver the required product to the complainant. By looking into these facts of the case on hand in our opinion Op no. 1 (Zomato) alone is liable to answer the claim of the complainant,” the commission reportedly said.In the order, Eshappa K Bhute, president of the commission, ordered Zomato to pay Sheethal Rs 50,000 as compensation towards the inconvenience and mental agony caused to her and Rs 10,000 towards her litigation cost.","A consumer court in Karnataka reportedly ruled in favour of a woman who didn't receive her momos order placed through food delivery app Zomato in 2023.

"Parvathi, the ‘invisible’ wife of Karnataka’s CM Siddaramaiah",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/parvathi-the-invisible-wife-of-karnatakas-cm-siddaramaiah/articleshow/111741484.cms,"Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah

BENGALURU: Spouses of prominent politicians usually make headlines for their presence, but in the case of Parvathi , wife of chief minister Siddaramaiah , her absence from public eye is the talking point, especially after her name surfaced in connection with the Muda alternative sites allotment scam , where she is listed as a beneficiary .While Siddaramaiah’s popularity has soared, Parvathi appears to have melted deeper into the shadows.She was missing at Siddaramaiah’s swearing-in ceremony last year at Kanteerava Stadium in Bengaluru, when he ascended the state’s top post for the second time. He is only one of two CMs to complete a full five-year term, after D Devaraj Urs, also from Mysuru district.Parvathi’s absence even extends beyond public events. She is rarely seen at private functions which Siddaramaiah attends and, in this era of modern gadgets, has managed to stay out of photographs, even those clicked with ubiq uitous mobile phones.“We rarely see her alongside Siddaramaiah. They stay in two different places,” said an aide of the CM .In 2017, when Siddaramaiah made a rare appearance as a guest on the popular television show ‘Weekend with Ramesh’, hosted by actor Ramesh Aravind. The show introduced Siddaramaiah’s family, friends, and teachers, but Parvathi was conspicuously absent.When Aravind curiously asked Siddaramaiah why his wife skips public events, he said: “She is very shy of a person.” She is even when Siddaramaiah offers ‘bagina’, the traditional offering to rivers when reservoirs fill up.Even during a legislative session in 2013, during Siddaramaiah’s first tenure as CM, the opposition quizzed him on his wife’s absence, but his aides suggested she did not like the limelight.When a TOI team visited Siddaramaiah’s hometown Siddaramanahundi, about 22km from Mysuru city in April last year ahead of assembly polls to meet Parvathi, she refused to come out of her home or even pose for a photograph. A battery of domestic helps ensured no one sneaked in.Despite being invisible in public, Parvathi is not a traditional homemaker as many believe. She actively campaigns for Siddaramaiah during elections, albeit away from media glare, and understands the nuances of politics. She makes certain decisions in consultation with her brother Mallikarjuna Swamy and son Yathindra, an MLC. She also leads a queen’s life in Siddaramaiah’s ancestral house, which has been tastefully renovated, blending old and modern architecture, and has a fleet of luxury SUVs at her disposal.","Parvathi appears to have melted deeper into the shadows.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

King Charles III plans extensive tour covering 12 time zones post Cancer treatment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/king-charles-iii-plans-extensive-tour-covering-12-time-zones-post-cancer-treatment/articleshow/111741574.cms,"King Charles III is set to visit Australia and Samoa in October, an ambitious trip that will cover 12 time zones and challenge the monarch's endurance as he continues to recover from his recent cancer treatment . The palace announced the visit on Sunday, signaling a significant step for the 75-year-old king, who has been gradually resuming his public duties following a hiatus due to his cancer diagnosis in early February.Although the itinerary in Australia will be ""limited,"" the decision to undertake such an extensive trip points towards Charles' ongoing recovery. The visit to Australia will be a pivotal moment for the king as he seeks to bolster support for the monarchy both domestically and internationally, the Associated Press reported.This trip will be the first time Charles visits one of the 14 countries outside the United Kingdom where the British monarch remains head of state since his ascension to the throne. While this connection is a source of pride for some, it is an unwelcome reminder of Britain's colonial dominance for others.Despite the anticipated welcome from supporters waving flags and singing ""God Save the King,"" Charles is also likely to encounter anti-monarchy sentiments in a nation where 45% of voters supported the creation of an Australian republic in a 1999 referendum.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's Labor Party advocates for abolishing the monarchy, although the government maintains that it is not a priority and has not set a timeline for another referendum.The palace has provided limited details about the tour, saying that Charles and Camilla will visit the Australian Capital Territory and New South Wales, as well as making a more formal state visit to Samoa, where the king will attend the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.The capital territory is home to Canberra, Australia's national capital, while Sydney, Australia's largest city, is located in New South Wales. The annual heads of government meeting will take place from October 21-25.However, the trip will not include a visit to New Zealand, as the palace stated, ""The King's doctors have advised that a further extension to Their Majesties' trip should be avoided at this time, to prioritize His Majesty's continued recovery.""Isaac Jeffrey, national director and CEO of the Australian Republic Movement, called for a meeting with Charles and questioned the justification for Australia to fund the royal visit. He said, ""This visit is a great opportunity for all Australians to ask themselves whether the British Royals really represent a modern Aussie democracy.""The trip comes at a time when the health issues of Charles and Kate, the Princess of Wales, have underscored the challenges faced by a streamlined royal family as the king pledges to reduce costs. With fewer working royals available to carry out the endless round of public engagements that make up the life of a modern royal, the remaining family members have been required to take on more events.The Princess of Wales, one of the most popular royals, underwent abdominal surgery and later revealed that she, too, had cancer, while Prince William took time off to support his wife and their young family.",King Charles III is set to visit Australia and Samoa in October. The trip will be a pivotal moment for the king as he seeks to bolster support for the monarchy.
