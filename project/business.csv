Justice Varma denies allegations, calls it a conspiracy



SC sets up three-member inquiry panel



Supreme Court press release full document:



The Supreme Court on Saturday released an inquiry report by Delhi high court chief justice Devendra Kumar Upadhyay regarding Justice Yashwant Varma's case, which involved the discovery of burnt currency notes by firefighters at his official residence.A video shared by Delhi Police Commissioner Sanjay Arora with Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna and Delhi high court chief justice Upadhyay purportedly shows the burnt cash, adding to the scrutiny.According to the report, on March 15, workers cleared some debris and partially burnt items from the storeroom. Subsequently, the Supreme Court instructed Justice Varma to maintain all phone data and communications. Additionally, the court requested records of security staff deployed at his residence over the previous six months. Justice Varma has been temporarily removed from his judicial responsibilities whilst the investigation continues.Also read: SC uploads video of burnt currency given by police, HC CJ suggests deeper probe; judge Yashwant Varma cries conspiracy Justice Varma has strongly denied any wrongdoing, calling the allegations an attempt to malign him. In his response to the inquiry panel, he stated that neither he nor his family had any connection to the cash allegedly found at the site.“My wife and I were not in Delhi at the time of the fire. The storeroom is a common area used by staff and is not part of my main residence. The claim that we kept cash there is absurd,” he said.Also read: Cash row inquiry report: 'No cash was ever placed in that storeroom', claims Justice Yashwant Varma Justice Varma also questioned the evidence, stating that when he inspected the storeroom after the fire, no cash was present. “Later, a video was shown to me suggesting otherwise. This raises serious concerns about evidence tampering,” he added.He further pointed to previous online allegations against him in December 2024, hinting at a possible effort to damage his reputation.The Supreme Court has set up a three-member inquiry panel to investigate the case. The committee includes Punjab & Haryana high court, chief justice Sheel Nagu, Himachal Pradesh high court chief justice G S Sandhawalia, and Karnataka high court judge Anu Sivaraman.With the inquiry now underway, the Supreme Court will review Justice Varma’s response along with forensic findings related to the alleged cash recovery. The panel will determine whether there is any direct link between the cash and the judge or his family.The court’s directive to preserve Justice Varma’s mobile data suggests that phone records and messages could play a role in the investigation. The case has sparked debate in legal and political circles, with concerns about both judicial integrity and possible attempts to frame the judge.The committee is expected to submit its findings to the Supreme Court in the coming weeks.","Fire broke out in a storeroom at Justice Yashwant Varma's official residence in New Delhi.

Fugitive businessman Mehul Choksi living in Belgium: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/fugitive-businessman-mehul-choksi-living-in-belgium-report/articleshow/119362229.cms,"<p>Mehul Choksi<br></p>

NEW DELHI: Fugitive businessman Mehul Choksi is reportedly living in Belgium's Antwerp with his wife, Preeti Choksi, after securing an ‘F Residency Card’ in the country, according to a media report.Indian authorities have reportedly urged Belgium to initiate his extradition to India after knowing his whereabouts, the Associated Times reported.Choksi, accused of defrauding Punjab National Bank of over Rs 13,000 crore, obtained residency in Belgium and secured an 'F Residency Card' on November 15, 2023, reportedly facilitated by his wife, a citizen of Belgium. According to the Carribean-focused media outlet, Choksi had fabricated his documents to Belgian authorities and misrepresented his nationality in his application process, failing to disclose the details of his existing citizenship.It is believed that Choksi was believed to be living in Antigua and Barbuda before travelling to Belgium and is planning to move to Switzerland.The matter came days after Antigua and Barbuda’s Foreign Minister EP Chet Greene said that Choksi is no longer on the island.Greene, who was invited to participate in the Raisina Dialogue, did not reveal where Choksi had gone and noted, “Mehul Choksi is not on the island. I am told he left Antigua for medical attention abroad (but) he remains a citizen of Antigua and Barbuda. The governments, yours (India) and mine, are working together on this matter.”Choksi departed from India in January 2018 after being implicated in the PNB case. His nephew, Nirav Modi, was also implicated and currently awaits extradition proceedings in London.In May 2023, Choksi informed a Mumbai special court that circumstances beyond his control prevented his return to India, contesting the label of 'fugitive economic offender'. He claims he did not leave to avoid prosecution and is not refusing to return, adding that Indian authorities suspended his passport.The ED approached the special court seeking to designate him as a 'fugitive economic offender' for avoiding their summons and to enable confiscation of his assets under applicable legislation.In May 2021, his disappearance from Antigua led to speculation about abduction by Indian authorities - claims disproven when he was located in Dominica. Some suggested he attempted to avoid potential extradition.Dominican authorities arrested him for unlawful entry, but he returned to Antigua on medical grounds with interim bail. The proceedings were halted in May 2022.Choksi disputed the illegal entry allegations, stating that individuals posing as police officers took him from his restaurant, Jolly Roger in Antigua, to Dominica by boat.In December 2023, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman informed Parliament that assets valued at Rs 22,280 crore had been recovered or liquidated to settle debts of wanted persons including Choksi.","Indian authorities have reportedly urged Belgium to initiate his extradition to India.

Can Heathrow nightmare hit Indian airports?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/can-heathrow-nightmare-hit-indian-airports/articleshow/119361222.cms,"A question of backup

Where Indian airports stand

Pressure to make green break

How to avoid hiccups

The power outage that crippled London-Heathrow on Friday was not an isolated incident for the global airline industry, except for the scale of flight disruptions, which was unprecedented. Ask aviation experts and they’ll tell you that it’s more than just an operational mishap but a warning for the entire airline industry.International Air Transport Association (IATA) director general Willie Walsh voiced the questions now on everyone’s mind. “First, how is it that critical infrastructure, of national and global importance, is totally dependent on a single power source without an alternative? If that is the case, as it seems, then it is a clear planning failure by the airport.”Heathrow is the UK’s largest hub, handling over 1,300 flights a day. For comparison, Mumbai airport handles about 950 flights a day. Heathrow had to shut down after a fire at the North Hyde substation, located about 1.5 miles north of the airport, caused a “significant power outage”. A Heathrow spokesperson said “backup systems have been working as they should but they are not sized to run the entire airport”.Can such an incident occur at any airport in the world or was it merely a result of Heathrow’s legacy infrastructure? Experts said a substation fire may not be a risk unique to Heathrow, but it exposes the pitfalls of relying on a single external power source without sufficient backup systems or onsite supply in the form of solar, wind, or diesel generators, etc. Aviation norms ensure critical units like air traffic control towers, runway lighting, etc, are typically fed by uninterruptible power supply (UPS). The problem is with nonessential operations, the kind that involves operations at passenger terminals.Mumbai airport, India’s second largest airport with its two passenger terminals and one cargo terminal, consumes 26.9 MW power a day. “We receive power through two independent, redundant (back up) sources. In the event of a failure at one source, the other can seamlessly take over 100% of the power load to ensure operational continuity. Each terminal gets electricity from more than one power station,” said a Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL) spokesperson.There are multiple pathways to deliver power to each terminal. “The system is designed to handle not just one failure, but two back-to-back failures without stopping operations. Both the terminals and the airfield have their own diesel generators, with a total capacity of 30 MW. These get activated in the case of a rare, major failure,” the official said. Mumbai airport runs on 100% renewable energy, 5% comes from on-site solar generation and 95% from hydro and wind energy. Bangalore International Airport Ltd (BIAL) said it uses a highly resilient and redundant power infrastructure for uninterrupted operations. “BLR airport receives power from Begur substation, which gets power through four independent supply lines from different substations,” said Hari Marar , MD and CEO, BIAL. “BIAL has also installed a separate transformer at the Begur substation dedicated for airport operations, minimising the risk of disruptions and also integrated on-site solar power generation and gone for tieups with off-site external renewable energy suppliers, ensuring a steady supply of green power,” he added.Unlike the 16-year old Bengaluru airport, many major airports rely on infrastructure designed long before modern digital systems and sustainability requirements became key concerns. While airports have kept upgrading facilities, many remain dependent on outdated power grids, centralised energy supply, and legacy IT systems that can be difficult to overhaul. Heathrow, for instance, opened in 1946 and expanded incrementally. Its electrical systems reflect a patchwork of upgrades rather than a fully modernised design, said an aviation expert.Most major hubs and airports of the world have started moving towards 2050 net-zero carbon emission goals (India’s net-zero target is set for 2070). In the coming decades, the demand for electricity at airports will see a steep rise as it powers everything from vehicles to aircraft. The move towards sustainable energy will happen even as terminal buildings and runways handle ever-increasing volumes of passengers and flights. Airports have begun preparing for this and “electrical resilience” has become a critical aspect of operations in recent years.All the 40 airports surveyed in a US study were found to be planning for or completing electrical infrastructure projects aimed at increasing their power resilience. These include removing overhead routes for an airport’s main feeder lines and taking those underground, and upgrading infrastructure to eliminate single points of failure. The latter is exactly the kind of upgrade that would prevent a Heathrow-like crisis.One of the most promising solutions — which began to find takers starting in the early 2000s — is the adoption of microgrids. These are localised grids that can operate independently or in tandem with the main grid, offering a self-sustained power supply. Microgrids can integrate renewable energy sources like solar and wind. Through these, and along with battery storage and backup generators, airports can reduce their reliance on external power sources. As airports move towards an increasingly electrified future, ensuring power reliability is no longer optional. Heathrow’s disruption should not just be another unfortunate event in aviation history — it should be a turning point.","Heathrow's power outage is a warning for the entire airline industry. Mumbai airport runs on 100% renewable energy, 5% comes from on-site solar generation and 95% from hydro and wind energy.

Investigators had found no evidence of forced entry, and the preliminary findings suggested that depression could have been a contributing factor. His body was discovered hanging from the ceiling fan, but no suicide note was recovered from the scene.Later, Sushant’s family lodged an FIR in Patna against Rhea Chakraborty and others, alleging abetment to suicide, theft, cheating, and wrongful confinement. This led to a jurisdictional dispute between the Bihar Police and the Mumbai Police, as the latter had initially been handling the investigation.Following the Bihar government’s recommendation, the central government approved a CBI probe into the case. On August 19, 2020, the Supreme Court of India directed the CBI to take over the investigation, granting the central agency full authority to conduct the inquiry.In its conclusive medico-legal opinion to the CBI, forensic specialists at AIIMS had dismissed the claims of ""poisoning and strangling"" made in the case.","Sushant Singh Rajput was found hanging at his Bandra home on June 14, 2020.

Later, when the national anthem was played, he stood smiling and waving at bystanders.Kumar came under heavy opposition fire in both Houses of the state legislature for disrespecting the national anthem. His latest act led to much mirth and has given fodder to opposition parties, RJD and Congress, to exploit in the upcoming state polls, arguing he can't be given another term in view of his health condition.BJP, sources said, is confident of winning another term alongside JDU and LJP, but the party's worry is that Kumar's unexpected behaviour in the public glare has often given openings to opponents.The party, however, believes Kumar continues to be a valuable partner, and the memories of RJD's ""jungle raj"" will blunt any possibility of ""anti-incumbency"". Moreover, Kumar is credited with good governance and raising the bar in terms of performance which, BJP insiders feel, will help the alliance win another term.Of late, Kumar's behaviour has not followed a consistent pattern; there have been days when no mishaps took place and he appeared to be in control, like during his 'Pragati Yatra', even though he was in the public glare for several days. But there have been odd days when Kumar behaved in a manner that his opponents derided him, and his supporters found difficult to justify. ""We hope that Nitish Kumar will overcome his on-off ways,"" a BJP functionary said.On questions raised by opposition parties on Kumar's fitness, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said it would not be appropriate for him to comment on any neta's health.

NEW DELHI: In a rare public disclosure, the Supreme Court on late Saturday night uploaded reports, photos, and videos related to allegations of unaccounted cash discovered at the official residence of Justice Yashwant Varma, a sitting judge of the Delhi High Court. The materials, now available on the court’s website, reveal the findings of an internal investigation and Justice Varma’s detailed response denying the allegations.The controversy erupted after a fire at Justice Varma’s official residence on March 14 led to the discovery of large quantities of cash. The Supreme Court’s decision to make these documents public signals the seriousness of the allegations and the judiciary’s commitment to transparency.According to the report by Delhi High Court Chief Justice Manmohan Upadhyay, the fire broke out in a storeroom of Justice Varma’s residence at approximately 11:30 PM on March 14. The fire was reported by Justice Varma’s personal secretary after being informed by household staff, reported Live Law.The next day, Chief Justice Upadhyay, along with the High Court’s Registrar, visited the bungalow and personally inspected the scene. The report mentions that the storeroom was located separately from the main living quarters and had limited access to Justice Varma’s servants, gardeners, and occasionally CPWD staff.The Delhi Police Commissioner shared with Chief Justice Upadhyay images and videos from the scene, which showed sacks of cash—some of it burnt. The Supreme Court has now released these materials publicly, offering an unprecedented look into the case.When shown the photographs of the cash, Justice Varma expressed concerns about a potential conspiracy against him. In his formal response to the Chief Justice of India, he categorically denied any connection to the cash or knowledge of how it arrived in the storeroom.“I unequivocally state that no cash was ever placed in that storeroom by me or any of my family members. The suggestion that this cash belonged to us is preposterous. The storeroom is an open, commonly used area near staff quarters, disconnected from my living spaces,” Justice Varma stated.He also criticized the media for what he described as premature and defamatory reporting. “I only wish that the media had conducted some enquiry before I came to be indicted and defamed in the press,” his response added.Following the initial inquiry, Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna instructed Chief Justice Upadhyay to seek further clarification from Justice Varma on three critical points:Justice Varma has been explicitly asked not to delete any data from his phone.In light of the findings, the Supreme Court has formed a three-member committee to conduct an in-depth in-house inquiry. The panel members are Justice Sheel Nagu (Chief Justice, Punjab & Haryana High Court), Justice GS Sandhawalia (Chief Justice, Himachal Pradesh High Court) and Justice Anu Sivaraman (Judge, Karnataka High Court).Additionally, Justice Varma has been temporarily relieved from judicial duties. The Delhi High Court Chief Justice has been instructed not to assign him any further cases pending the outcome of the inquiry.","The Supreme Court on late Saturday night uploaded reports, photos, and videos related to allegations of unaccounted cash discovered at the official residence of Justice Yashwant Varma.

Any delimitation exercise carried out by the Union Government to improve the content and character of democracy should be carried out transparently, enabling political parties of all the States, State Governments and other stakeholders to deliberate, discuss and contribute in it.

Given the fact that the legislative intent behind the 42nd, 84th and 87th Constitutional amendments was to protect / incentivise States which have implemented population control measures effectively and the goal of national population on stabilisation has not yet been achieved, the freeze Parliamentary constituencies based on 1971 Census Population, should be extended by another 25 years.

The States which have effectively implemented the population control program and consequently whose population share has come down, should not be penalised. The Union Government must enact necessary constitutional amendments for this purpose.

The Core Committee consisting of Members of Parliament from the represented States will coordinate the parliamentary strategies to counter any attempts by the Union Government to undertake any delimitation exercise contrary to the principles mentioned above.

The Core Committee of MPs shall submit a Joint Representation on the above lines to the Hon'ble Prime Minister of India during the ongoing Parliamentary session.

The Political Parties from different states represented in the meeting will initiate efforts to bring about appropriate Legislative Assembly resolutions in their respective States on the issue and communicate the same to Union Government.

The JAC will also undertake necessary efforts to disseminate information on the history and context of past delimitation exercises and the consequences of the proposed delimitation among the citizens of their respective States, through a coordinated public opinion mobilization strategy.

Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin on Saturday convened the inaugural meeting of the Joint Action Committee (JAC) in Chennai, aimed at opposing the central government's proposed delimitation exercise . This initiative has garnered significant attention from various southern states, which fear that the exercise could undermine their political representation and rights.Stalin described the meeting as a ""historic day"" for India's federal structure, emphasising that it marked the beginning of a movement to safeguard the interests of states that have effectively implemented population control measures .""Today will be etched in history as the day when states that have contributed to our nation's development came together to safeguard its federal structure by ensuring fair delimitation,"" said CM Stalin.Stalin's remarks underscored concerns that if the delimitation proceeds based on future census data, states like Tamil Nadu could lose parliamentary representation, which he argued would compromise their rights and erode democracy itself.""This is more than a meeting. It is the beginning of a movement that will shape the future of our country,"" he said at the start of the meeting.The meeting was attended by leaders from several southern states, including Kerala, Telangana, and Punjab. However, it faced opposition from Tamil Nadu's BJP faction, which staged protests against the JAC's proceedings.Stalin futher said that the next meeting of the JAC would take place in Hyderabad, urging all opposition parties to unite against what he termed an unfair delimitation process.","Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin convened the inaugural meeting of the Joint Action Committee (JAC) in Chennai.

Initial reports put the amount at Rs 15 crore, although this figure has not been officially confirmed.The Supreme Court's in-house inquiry procedure dictates that when allegations arise against a High Court judge, the Chief Justice of India, after a preliminary inquiry, forms a committee of three judges to investigate the matter after seeking a response from the judge in question.Significantly, the Chief Justice of the High Court of Delhi for the time being has been asked not to assign any judicial work to Justice Yashwant Varma. The report submitted by the Chief Justice of the High Court of Delhi, response of Justice Yashwant Varma, and other documents, are being uploaded on the Supreme Court website.Following the alleged discovery of the unaccounted cash, the Supreme Court collegium had convened a meeting and the Chief Justice of the High Court of Delhi, D K Upadhyay, was asked to file a report regarding the allegations against Justice Varma. The report was submitted on March 21.In another decision, which the SC has clarified was not connected to the allegations, Justice Varma was transferred back to his parent court in Allahabad.The Supreme Court has emphasised that the proposal for Justice Varma's transfer was independent of any ongoing inquiry into the cash allegations.In February 2018, the Central Bureau of Investigation had named Justice Varma as an accused in the Simbhaoli Sugar Mill fraud case involving a ₹97.85 crore loan misappropriation. Justice Varma was a non-executive director of the company at the time. Although the CBI launched a probe, the case seemingly lost momentum, and a subsequent court order to resume the investigation was overturned by the Supreme Court in 2024, effectively ending the inquiry.","Allegations surfaced against Justice Varma after a fire at his official residence led to the alleged discovery of a significant amount of cash.

NEW DELHI: Two months after it conducted searches on the premises of a railway claims tribunal judge in Patna, R K Mittal, and his associates in a case of Rs 50 crore fraudulent withdrawal of death compensations, ED on Friday attached 24 properties belonging to the accused.This was not the first time the agency had acted against a judge accused of alleged bribery or association with fraudsters engaged in fixing benches and cultivating judges for favourable judgments. Apart from the known instances, the agency is also learned to be keeping a close surveillance on conflicts of interest of judges and alleged efforts to bribe them.On Aug 10 in 2023, ED arrested Panchkula's former special court judge Sudhir Parmar in connection with alleged bribery and for favouring accused in a money laundering case against real estate developer IREO and its promoter Lalit Goyal.Goyal was arrested by the agency just a month before it took Parmar into custody. Panchkula's special CBI court judge was suspended by Punjab and Haryana high court in April that year after agencies produced ""incriminating evidence"" against him for allegedly favouring the IREO promoters accused in a money laundering investigation .ED later arrested Goyal's associates and promoters of M3M, Basant Bansal and Pankaj Bansal, in a separate case. ED in its remand note had claimed that ""Sudhir Parmar (the Panchkula judge) was showing favouritism to the accused Roop Bansal, his brother Basant Bansal, the owners of M3M, and Lalit Goyal, the owner of IREO Group, in lieu of undue advantages"".In yet another case, while probing the Chhattisgarh PDS scam pertaining to the period of the previous Congress-led govt of Bhupesh Baghel, ED came across evidence of alleged liaisoning between two senior IAS officers who were accused in the case and a judge of the Chhattisgarh high court influencing the trial.ED brought the issue to the notice of Supreme Court, which transferred the judge in question to Patna high court, an action similar to what the SC collegium had proposed in case of a judge of Delhi high court after alleged recovery of a huge pile of cash from his residence.In the case of Chhattisgarh HC judge, as reported by TOI, ED had told SC that two IAS officers, Anil Tuteja and Alok Shukla, ""were in touch with the high court judge who granted bail to Shukla"". The agency further alleged that the then advocate general of the state had been liaising between the two accused and the judge, indirectly alleging quid pro quo in relief granted to the babus under investigation in the PDS scam.","Two months after it conducted searches on the premises of a railway claims tribunal judge in Patna, R K Mittal, and his associates, ED attached 24 properties belonging to the accused.

NEW DELHI: Noting that a woman who is employed and holds the same post as her husband and can take care of herself independently, Supreme Court has turned down her plea seeking maintenance from her estranged husband.A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan refused to grant relief to the woman who is working as an assistant professor and sought maintenance from her husband. ""Both the first petitioner and respondent (husband and wife) are holding the same post of an Assistant Professor. No case for interference is made out in exercise of our jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution of India.

Opposing her plea, advocate Shashank Singh, appearing for the husband, told the court that she was earning around Rs 60,000 per month and both of them were holding the post of the same grade.But the wife pleaded that she was entitled to maintenance and the wife's earning capacity and qualification cannot automatically absolve the husband of his obligation to provide maintenance. She told the bench that her husband was earning around Rs 1 lakh per month. As there was dispute over their monthly salaries, the court had directed both of them to place before it the salary slip of the last one year.Wife approached the apex court after her plea of maintenance was rejected by Madhya Pradesh HC and a trial court.","A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan refused to grant relief to the woman who is working as an assistant professor and sought maintenance from her husband.

NEW DELHI: Acting swiftly on Delhi high court chief justice D K Upadhyay's adverse report against Justice Yashwant Varma on the alleged discovery of a huge pile of cash at his residence, CJI Sanjiv Khanna Saturday appointed a three-judge panel , comprising two HC chief justices and one HC judge, to inquire into the charges.In another important decision, CJI Khanna has asked the Delhi HC chief justice ""not to assign any judicial work to Justice Varma for the time being"", which would mean he is barred from doing any judicial work till the inquiry panel submits its report to the CJI.This also means that the March 20 decision of the CJI-led five-judge collegium to repatriate Justice Varma to his parent Allahabad HC would be kept in abeyance till the panel concludes inquiry and submits its report.The Allahabad HC Bar Association had questioned the decision of the collegium, led by CJI Khanna, and comprising Justices B R Gavai, Surya Kant, A S Oka and Vikram Nath, asking if Allahabad HC was a ""trash bin"". The panel comprising Punjab and Haryana HC CJ Sheel Nagi, Himachal Pradesh HC CJ GS Sandhawalia, and Karnataka HC's Anu Sivaraman will ""inquire into the allegations against Justice Varma, a sitting judge of the Delhi HC,"" the SC said in a late evening press release. No time limit has been fixed by the CJI for the panel to complete inquiry proceedings.On March 14, the day of Holi celebrations, a fire had allegedly broken out in the small hours of the night at Justice Varma's official residence at Tughlaq Road in the heart of Lutyens Delhi. The police and fire brigade rushed to the spot to douse the fire and allegedly stumbled upon a huge pile of cash in one of the outhouses of the bungalow. This was reported to the higher-ups who, in turn, informed the CJI on March 15. On the same day, the CJI had asked the Delhi HC CJ to submit a report on the incident along with Justice Varma's explanation about the alleged reovery of cash. The SC had said on Friday, ""On receiving the information, theDelhi HC CJ commenced the in-house inquiry procedure collecting evidence and information prior to the collegium meeting on March 20.""On March 20, the five-judge collegium met and decided to transfer Justice Varma to Allahabad HC, his parent HC from where he was brought to Delhi HC in 2021. The collegium had sought the opinions of consultee judges - Justices Manoj Misra (from Allahabad HC) and Justice Manmohan (who was CJ of Delhi HC prior to his recent appointment as SC judge).Justice Varma had risen to number two in seniority in Delhi HC and would have ended ninth in the seniority list in Allahabad HC had he been shifted there. If the inquiry panel submits an adverse report, Justice Varma would have no option but to resign as his refusal would force the hands of CJI Khanna to recommend the Union govt to initiate the removal process in Parliament, which is similar to the process applicable for removal of SC judges. Article 124(4) of the Constitution provides: ""A judge of SC shall not be removed from his office except by an order of President passed after an address by each House of Parliament supported by a majority of the total membership of that House and by a majority of not less than two-third of the members of the House present and voting has been presented to President in the same session for such removal on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity.""","CJI Sanjiv Khanna Saturday appointed a three-judge panel to inquire into the charges.

Modi’s presence at G7 uncertain as Canada says no decision on summit invitations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-presence-at-g7-uncertain-as-canada-is-yet-to-finalise-invites/articleshow/119356690.cms,"NEW DELHI: With barely 3 months to go for the G7 summit in Canada, suspense looms over PM Narendra Modi's participation in the event. Modi has been a regular at G7 since 2019 but, asked about whether India will be invited for this year's summit, host Canada told TOI no decision has been taken yet about participation of guest countries.Canada’s ongoing G7 presidency will see it hosting the summit on June 15-17 in Kananaskis, Alberta, at a time its bilateral ties with India remain frosty and in the middle of an unprecedented crisis with the US provoked by a nasty tariff war. The foreign ministers of the group of economically most advanced nations put up a show of unity in Charlevoix earlier this month reaffirming their “unwavering” support for Ukraine but the G7 has been riddled with concerns about Trump’s treatment of allies and his reluctance to call out Russia for its aggression.“No decisions on summit invitations have been taken at this time. More information will be made available in due time,’’ said a Canadian official with the G7 media relations team. Both Modi and his predecessor Manmohan Singh have in the past been invited for G7 summits. Modi, in fact, has been a regular since 2019, when French President Emmanuel Macron invited him for the meeting in Biarritz. Then the Trump administration too had invited him for the Camp David summit in 2020, although it was called off later because of Covid-19.It's learnt that former PM Justin Trudeau, widely blamed for wrecking ties with India with his slapdash approach to the Khalistan murder plot, may have left the choice of guests to his successor. The new PM, Mark Carney, has said he wants to rebuild ties with India but is currently saddled with the unenviable task of dealing with Trump’s adventurism. Carney has also said he wants to create trading relationships with new partners, and to build the strongest economy in the G7. Apparently, limited space at the summit venue might also be a factor in having very few, or even no, guest leaders.Carney has so far been silent on Khalistan supporter Hardeep Singh Nijjar’s killing that caused a dramatic downturn in ties, including a downgrading of the diplomatic relationship. India has said it hopes to rebuild ties based on mutual trust and sensitivity but will probably wait to see the outcome of the next elections that Carney is likely to call soon and will be held, according to reports from Canada, on April 28. While it’s fashionable here to blame Trudeau for the current status of ties, the RCMP, which has investigated the case, maintains that Trudeau’s position was informed by information provided by the agency.","Modi has been a regular at G7 since 2019 but, asked about whether India will be invited for this year's summit, host Canada told TOI no decision has been taken yet.

He is the first writer from Chhattisgarh, and the 12th Hindi litterateur, to be bestowed with the honour. “His writings are known for their simplicity, sensitivity and unique style. He is also famous for experimental writing in modern Hindi literature ,” a press release issued by Bharatiya Jnanpith said.Shukla responded in free verse when asked for his reaction, “Mujhe likhna bahut tha, lekin bahut kam likh paya, maine dekha bahut, suna bhi maine bahut, mehsoos bhi kiya bahut, lekin likhne main thoda hi likha.” (“I had a lot to write, but could write very little, I saw a lot, I heard a lot, I felt a lot too, but I wrote only a little.)Starting with the ordinary, yet extraordinary line, “Kitna sukh tha ki har baar ghar laut kar aane ke liye main baar baar ghar se baahar nikloonga (It was such a feeling of happiness that to order to return home each time, I had to step out again and again,” Naukar Ki Kameez (The servant’s shirt) became his most acclaimed and popular work.

His other novels are Deewar Mein Ek Khidki Rehti Thi (A window lived in the wall) and Khilega To Dekhenge (Will see when it blooms).“Shukla’s novels have cemented his position as a writer with an audacious and experimental craft. He is also lauded for the perspicacity of his poems. He is a deserving choice for his literary genius,” said Sahitya Akademi recipient writer Mridula Garg.Eminent Dalit writer Sheoraj Singh “Bechain” says the common people in Shukla’s literary world are more powerful and magical than those created by writers who navigate the world of enchanted imagination. “A streak of realism runs through his poetry as well. He is a true ‘sahityasevi’,” he said.Born in Rajnandgaon, now located in west Chhattisgarh, Shuka is a post-graduate in krishi vigyan (agriculture science) from Jabalpur. His first poetry collection, Lagbhag Jai Hind (Almost Jai Hind) was published in 1971.“He is one of those rare writers who carved out his own path. He has not only inspired a generation of young writers but also created his own category of readers. In his writings, we see the common people’s striving for dignity, and the rhythm of relationship between humans with nature and environment,” said Satyanand Nirupam, editorial director, Rajkamal Prakashan group.Jnanpith Award is the highest literary honour India given to writers who have excelled in literature in different Indian languages.

CHURACHANDPUR: The future of hundreds of children in Manipur - its next doctors, engineers, writers, teachers, and lawyers - is slipping through the cracks. ""I had a dream, and then it was gone,"" said Hatneu Haokip, 21, once a bright Class XI science student in Imphal.The ethnic conflict that erupted in May 2023 has done more than just displace 60,000 people and claim over 260 lives - it has stolen childhoods and left an entire generation teetering on edge of uncertainty.At Sadbhavana Mandap, a camp near Tuibong Multipurpose Hall in Churachandpur, the scene is painfully familiar. Of the 400 people crammed into this temporary shelter, 208 are children. Their days blur into one another - playing aimlessly on phone screens, kicking dust outside. Their parents watch in helpless agony, their own worries of survival overshadowing the shattered hopes of their children.In Churachandpur district alone, there are 84 relief camps. Govt schools in Churachandpur town are bursting at the seams. An organisation has taken in 400 displaced kids, but how far can that go?Hatneu had dreamt of studying pharmaceuticals, of wearing a white coat and making a difference. But then came the violence. Now, she sits in a Churachandpur camp, her textbooks replaced by a gnawing sense of loss. ""It is the same story for many living in relief camps,"" she said.The camp is a maze of despair, where numbers tell a grim tale: 81 children under six, 127 between six and 18. Among them, a handful still cling to education - such as three college students trying to hold on to their ambitions.Lucky Deb, a 39-year-old driver, watched his four children fight a losing battle against time. His eldest two were in high school when their education was put on pause. ""They now go to school, but it is not enough,"" he said. ""Their crucial years are slipping away. Govt must step in before it is too late.""For Tabitha, 24, survival is a daily act of faith. A former beauty parlour owner from Imphal West, she had enough to provide for herself and her son. Now, her business is gone, her home a distant memory, and her son's education a casualty of war. ""What can I do except pray?"" she said.A man overseeing the camp's basic needs - food and medical aid - spoke with a weary sigh: ""Initially, private institutions stepped in to help, but now they are struggling to even pay their staff.""Each of these relief camps is a microcosm of lost dreams, where young minds with untapped potential are wasting away in forced idleness.

The Sisyphus Clause



The Myth of Sisyphus

I said that the world is absurd, but I was too hasty. This world in itself is not reasonable, that is all that can be said. But what is absurd is the confrontation of this irrational and the wild longing for clarity whose call echoes in the human heart. The absurd depends as much on man as on the world. Albert Camus

So maybe Pakistan is happier.

Not because it is richer, freer, safer, or better—

But because, like Sisyphus, it has made peace with the mountain.

And it no longer asks why.

Long before he became a meme for slapping Chris Rock at the Oscars for a joke that seemed like a punchline for Big Pharma to sell some follicular solutions, Will Smith acted in some remarkable movies. One of the most moving was, a fine film on paternal-filial relationships. In a rather dark moment, he wonders if Thomas Jefferson gaslit America by stating in the Declaration of Independence that every American would be endowed with certain rights, including life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. He says in the movie: “And I remember thinking: how did he know to put the pursuit part in there? That maybe happiness is something that we can only pursue and maybe we can actually never have it. No matter what.”It’s a sentiment that theappears to agree with—at least for Indians , who have been rankeddespite the fact that it’s a rising global power—one of the few, to borrow a line from the proverbial egg-faced Shashi Tharoor , whose leader can hug both the premiers of Ukraine and Russia.But that’s hardly surprising, because it completely fits into the WENA (Western Europe and Northern American) idea of India. If one were to learn about India solely from Anglosphere coverage, one would assume that India was a genocidal hellhole where the living conditions were worse than sub-Saharan Africa.The fact is that if irony could be measured, the World Happiness Report 2025 would be a more shoddily written Don Quixote. India is ranked 118th—below Saudi Arabia (32), Libya (79), Venezuela (82), Uzbekistan (53), Rwanda (116), China (68), Iran (99), Lebanon (104), Palestine (108), Pakistan (109), Ukraine (111), Iraq (101), Cameroon (104), a list that includes war zones, authoritarian regimes, debt-ridden states, and nations facing civil unrest. Even if one were to accept that there are enough citizens of the world who prefer being a fed sparrow to a hungry songbird, even Pakistanis would be shocked to learn that they are ranked above India and would wonder if the only person surveyed for this poll was Osama Bin Laden So, before we get into the problem with the methodology, let’s do a simple headcount between India and Pakistan. Currently, India’s GDP is $3.7 trillion—the fifth largest in the world and the only one after the US to outstrip its former colonial rulers. Pakistan, meanwhile, is a $375 billion economy—not even 10% of India’s size. India’s digital economy is booming, startups are thriving, and infrastructure is expanding at a record pace. Meanwhile, Pakistan’s economy is lurching from one IMF bailout to another like a tippler looking for his next drink.Pakistan is essentially running on loans. The country has over $125 billion in external debt, with crippling inflation and foreign reserves barely enough to cover a few weeks of imports. It defaulted on several payments before being saved by yet another IMF bailout. India, by contrast, is not only managing its debt prudently but has become a net lender to the IMF.As for the contrasting militaries, there’s a delightful anecdote from 1957 recalled by Anvar Alikhan in apiece titled, where he draws parallels between the militaries of the two countries.He writes: “A true story: In 1957, the then Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru , visiting the office of General Thimayya, the Chief of the Army Staff, saw a steel cabinet behind his desk and asked the general what it contained. The general replied that the top drawer contained the nation’s defence plans. And the second drawer contained the confidential files of the nation’s top generals. And what about the third drawer, enquired Nehru. Ah, said the general with a straight face, the third drawer contains my secret plans for a military coup against you. Nehru laughed, but there was apparently a tinge of nervousness to his laughter.”While the idea of a military coup in India remained a joke locked in a cabinet, in Pakistan, the military was so good at dealing with law and order and other issues that whenever martial law was declared, people would rejoice: “” playing on the termWhile India became a nuclear-armed democracy—warts and all—Pakistan devolved into a de facto military state whose generals always had more power than elected officials. Coups happened with the alacrity of Friday prayers. In fact, Imran Khan was propped up by the military to counter mainstream politicians, but the former World Cup winner soon became more powerful than his puppeteers intended. Yet, a country where the army decides your prime minister, your policies, and sometimes even your breakfast menu is apparently living its best life.Yes, India’s secularism is under scrutiny and faces legitimate criticism. But it still remains a constitutionally enshrined, functioning democracy with an independent judiciary, regular elections, and a diverse press. Pakistan, in contrast, is a state founded on religious identity and has institutionalised discrimination against minorities. Ahmadiyyas can’t even call themselves Muslim, and Hindus are regularly persecuted. Minorities live under a blasphemy law that’s been used more as a weapon than a shield.So, how exactly does a theocracy with enforced religious conformity and institutional bigotry outscore a pluralist democracy—even if imperfect?India is seen as a rising power on the global stage. It’s hosting G20 summits, mediating in global conflicts, and pushing for a multipolar world. Pakistan, meanwhile, is often the subject of IMF reports, FATF warnings, and UN human rights resolutions. India’s passport opens doors; Pakistan’s passport raises eyebrows.In fact, the contrast between India and Pakistan can even be seen in both nations’ favourite pastimes: cricket. In recent years, much to the chagrin of English and Australian columnists, India has become the de facto Trump of world cricket —big enough to call the shots—so much so that when Pakistan finally got the chance to host a Champions Trophy, India refused to set foot. While the Pakistani team went out dismally in the group stage, India romped home to pick up the trophy without as much as breaking a sweat. To add insult to injury, India’s dominance meant that Pakistan (the hosts) had to travel to Dubai to play its match, and India reaching the final robbed Pakistan of the spectacle.India’s changed standing on the global stage can be summarised by the contrasting online reaction to a tweet from an American commentator with a Ukraine flag (a marker of online inanity), which wondered why there was no outrage when Prime Minister Modi (like Zelenskyy) wasn’t dressed in a suit. Most commentators pointed out that Modi was dressed in traditional garb (a kurta pyjama and a jacket) as opposed to Zelenskyy’s cosplay sweatshirt and khakis. However, the real kicker was even white Americans—who often spend time mocking JD Vance’s wife —defended the Indian Prime Minister because he wasn’t in America asking for more funds and weapons.The implication that India—a growing economy, a space-faring democracy, and a hub of innovation—is less “happy” than war-torn or economically collapsed nations raises serious questions about the methodology behind these rankings. The report relied heavily on subjective self-assessments, primarily via Gallup’s “Cantril Ladder,” where respondents rated their lives on a scale from 0 to 10. These were then modelled against six variables: GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and perceptions of corruption. However, many of these variables were based more on perceptions than hard data. In societies where expectations are low, or media is tightly controlled, people often report higher satisfaction. In contrast, in dynamic democracies like India, rising aspirations, political noise, and media scrutiny tend to yield harsher self-assessments—even in the midst of tangible progress.All of this brought renewed attention to the flaws of international perception-based indices—something Sanjeev Sanyal and Aakanksha Arora had flagged in a 2022 working paper . They had offered a pointed critique of three influential global indices: Freedom in the World (by Freedom House), Democracy Index (by the Economist Intelligence Unit), and the V-Dem Indices (by the University of Gothenburg)—all of which had routinely rated India poorly.Sanyal-Arora had argued that these indices were largely opinion-driven, relying on small, opaque pools of anonymous “experts” whose identities, qualifications, and nationalities were often undisclosed. Freedom House, for instance, used 25 subjective questions assessed by internal analysts and external advisers, but published no transparency on scoring mechanisms. The EIU claimed to use public opinion, yet India’s last World Values Survey input dated back to 2012—meaning more recent assessments were based almost entirely on expert opinion. V-Dem, meanwhile, used 473 variables, many of them highly subjective, including notions like “self-censorship” or “deliberative quality of governance.”They also noted that many of the questions used were ill-suited for cross-country comparisons, such as “how pervasive is corruption?” or “to what extent is direct popular vote utilised?”—metrics that penalised democracies like India and the US for not holding national referendums, while awarding higher scores to one-party states like Cuba.India and Pakistan are on two different trajectories, and even the honest Pakistani knows that. If Albert Camus was right, then perhaps the secret to happiness lies not in prosperity, democracy, or purpose—but in the acceptance of futility, the repetition of struggle, and the knowledge that there is no divine reward at the summit.In, Camus describes a man condemned to eternally roll a boulder up a mountain, only for it to roll back down each time. It is an absurd fate, but in contemplating it—knowing it is his, accepting it as unchangeable—Sisyphus becomes, paradoxically, free. Camus writes: “One must imagine Sisyphus happy.”Perhaps this, then, explains Pakistan’s higher ranking in the World Happiness Report 2025. Perhaps Pakistan is the Sisyphus of South Asia. A nation locked in a cycle of economic collapse, military coups, IMF bailouts, energy shortages, and cricketing heartbreak, and yet—it smiles on the way back down the hill.Where India fights, debates, builds, reforms, and aspires—Pakistan accepts. It no longer expects the summit. Its happiness is not driven by achievement but by survival, not by growth but by repetition. Where India agonises over its democracy, Pakistan no longer pretends to have one. Where India chases global leadership, Pakistan is content negotiating its next loan. There is peace in low expectations, freedom in detachment. If happiness is the absence of disillusionment, then what better strategy than to stop being illusioned in the first place?And so, while Indians grumble through traffic jams in growing cities, rage against corruption, or demand better governance, Pakistanis return to their rock each morning, lift it with muscle memory, and smile—because nothing else was promised. As Camus wrote: “Each atom of that stone... forms a world.”Every bailout is a new beginning. Every coup, a cosmic reset. Every World Cup loss, a philosophical cleansing. They roll the rock. It rolls back. The absurd cycle is complete. Meanwhile, India is caught in its own existential spiral—still believing happiness is to be earned, still chasing Jefferson’s promise of “the pursuit”, still demanding meaning from its journey. But as Camus warns, meaning is a human construct. The world owes us none.","India is ranked 118th among 147 countries in the World Happiness Report 2025.

Long-time Tesla investor Ross Gerber, the CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, who called for Elon Musk 's exit from the company has now said that the Tesla Board should have never let him purchase Twitter as that started Elon Musk's distraction from Tesla. ""Why has the board of directors sat quietly while so much brand value has been eroded to the point that cars are being set on fire?"" he said. ""It's been wildly negligent that the board has done nothing to curb Elon's behavior, especially around extremist statements.""Gerber's statement came as shares of Tesla dropped in the wake of massive protests against Elon Musk inside the country and also outside. Hundreds of Tesla vehicles have been set on fire showing anger against Elon's interference in the government decisions.

Justice Varma did not hold court in the HC on Friday.In a rare press note, Supreme Court said, “On receiving the information, Delhi HC CJ commenced in-house enquiry procedure collecting evidence and information… and will be submitting a report to CJI Sanjiv Khanna Friday.” The note was mum on the “information”, but that it warranted an “in-house inquiry procedure” left little to the imaginationThe report will be examined and processed for further and necessary action,"" the SC said.

Elon Musk reveals why he uses Ketamine—and why investors should approve

Musk on late-night posts: ‘Almost always sober, but questions remain'

X’s advertising business and content moderation policies

Elon Musk cancels Don Lemon’s X deal after tense interview

Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk recently addressed his use of the medication ketamine, his late-night social media activity, and the challenges facing X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. In a wide-ranging interview with journalist Don Lemon, Musk explained his reasons for using ketamine, emphasizing its effectiveness in managing what he described as a “negative chemical state” in his brain. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO also defended his work ethic, stating that excessive use of ketamine would interfere with his ability to manage his companies. The conversation further touched on X’s advertising struggles, Musk’s stance on content moderation, and the controversial termination of Lemon’s deal with the platform.During the interview, Musk disclosed that he has a prescription for ketamine from a licensed medical professional. He explained that he takes a small dose of the drug once every other week to alleviate symptoms of depression. Musk described his condition as possibly genetic and not necessarily linked to external negative events.Ketamine, originally developed as an anesthetic, has gained attention in recent years as a potential treatment for depression, anxiety, and other mental health conditions. Some clinical studies have suggested that low doses of ketamine can have rapid antidepressant effects, though concerns remain about its long-term safety and potential for misuse.Musk firmly denied any overuse of the drug, emphasizing that maintaining mental sharpness is crucial given his demanding work schedule, which often involves 16-hour workdays. He argued that excessive ketamine consumption would hinder his ability to run his companies effectively.Musk also addressed concerns about his frequent late-night posts on X. When asked whether he is under the influence while posting, he responded that he is “almost always” sober during these sessions. However, he did not clarify whether he was referring specifically to ketamine or other substances.The billionaire’s social media activity has often attracted controversy, as his posts have led to significant market fluctuations, legal disputes, and public scrutiny. Despite this, Musk continues to use the platform actively, frequently sharing updates, opinions, and memes.The conversation also covered X’s advertising business, which has faced challenges since Musk acquired the company. Many advertisers distanced themselves from the platform due to concerns about the rise in controversial and hateful content under Musk’s leadership.In a previous public statement, Musk harshly criticized advertisers who left X over concerns about antisemitic content, telling them they could “go f**k yourself.” However, in the interview with Lemon, he claimed that almost all major advertisers have returned to the platform and that both advertising and subscription revenue are growing rapidly.Musk reiterated his position on content moderation, stating that advertisers are free to choose where their ads appear but should not dictate censorship policies for the entire platform. He maintained that X would not accommodate demands for broad censorship beyond ad placement preferences.The interview also led to a falling-out between Musk and Don Lemon. Originally, Lemon had entered into a deal with X to host his new streaming show on the platform. However, following the interview, Musk canceled the agreement, claiming that Lemon had approached the conversation with a bias akin to mainstream media.The dispute between Musk and Lemon further highlights the ongoing tensions between X and traditional media organizations. Since taking over the platform, Musk has positioned X as a space for “free speech,” often clashing with journalists and critics who argue that the platform has become more hostile to certain viewpoints.","Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk recently addressed his use of the medication ketamine, his late-night social media activity, and the challenges facing X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach. It became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

Ten years of incumbency

Liquor scam, Sheesh Mahal dent Kejriwal's 'imandaar' image

No tie-up, Congress did strategic campaigning

Flood of freebies but no next-level of development

BJP focuses on Kejriwal, Hindutva takes back seat

BJP's latent vote

Rahul roasted Kejriwal as payback for Haryana

MCD with AAP: No excuses

Steady exodus of AAP leaders

AAP goes negative

The BJP on Saturday pulled off a major political upset by unseating the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) from Delhi after over 10 years. As per the latest Election Commission data, the BJP may win around 48 seats and the Kejriwal-led party may secure around 22 seats in the 70-seat Assembly.BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a fierce contest from the New Delhi seat by a margin of 4,089 votes. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes.Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.""We accept the mandate of the people with great humility. I congratulate the BJP for this victory and I hope they will fulfil all the promises for which people have voted for them,"" Kejriwal said in a video address posted on X.In the evening as the results were decalred, PM Modi kicked off his victory speech with a powerful chant of ""Yamuna Maiya ki Jai"". PM Modi declared that the people of Delhi were experiencing both relief and joy -- relief from the ""disaster"" (AAP-da governance) and joy in embracing a new era under BJP rule. ""I had written a letter to every Delhi resident, urging them to give the BJP a chance to serve in the 21st century...Today, I bow my head in gratitude to every family in Delhi for trusting us. You have given us love with an open heart, and I assure you that we will return it manifold through rapid development,"" PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also attacked the AAP over allegations of corruption against its leaders, saying that all links of such charges will be probed and those who ""looted"" money will have to return it.With the BJP set to regain control of Delhi after 27 years, what went wrong for the Aam Aadmi Party?After governing Delhi for a decade, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) faced significant anti-incumbency.While AAP achieved impressive results in health and education during its first two terms, and kept voters happy with power and water subsidies, unfulfilled promises, such as improved air quality, became major poll issues.The AAP's assertion that the BJP government at the Centre was creating roadblocks in its functioning began to be increasingly seen by voters as excuses, especially after ten years in power.The BJP's ""double engine"" promise, suggesting seamless governance between the central and state levels, appealed to voters against the backdrop of AAP's constant conflicts with the Centre. Furthermore, internal disarray within the AAP, with senior leaders facing jail time, added to the challenges of incumbency .The image of Arvind Kejriwal as an anti-corruption crusader suffered a setback due to several factors, most notably the controversy surrounding the now-scrapped liquor policy.The BJP accused the AAP government of turning Delhi into a ""city of drunkards"" with the new policy, and receiving crores in kickbacks from those who opened the vends.Probes by central agencies led to the arrest of top AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, and Sanjay Singh. These arrests forced Sisodia to step down as deputy chief minister and kept the AAP in ""firefighting mode"", distracting from fulfilling its 2020 poll promises.Additionally, the ""Sheesh Mahal"" controversy, referring to the renovated residence of the chief minister, further dented Kejriwal's image. The BJP further highlighted a Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report that indicated the renovation cost had increased from an initial estimate of Rs 7.91 crore to Rs 33.66 crore by completion.AAP has been synonymous with Arvind Kejriwal since its inception. Kejriwal, initially seen as an agent of change with his untucked shirt and no-nonsense demeanor, resonated with the common person.However, the anti-corruption image of Kejriwal and his party suffered irreparable damage, specially after the AAP leader's arrest in March 2024 on corruption allegations and his subsequent resignation as CM.While he was later granted bail, the leadership transition to Atishi and the circumstances surrounding Kejriwal's arrest damaged the party's image and cohesion.The absence of an alliance with the Congress party and the Congress's strategic campaigning likely contributed to the AAP's loss.In previous elections, the AAP had significantly reduced the Congress's presence in the Delhi assembly.Attempts to convince Congress workers to collaborate with AAP volunteers reportedly led to an ""existential crisis"" among them.The Congress decided to campaign aggressively against the AAP, sensing ""anger building up against the AAP"". Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attacked the AAP in the final days of the Delhi campaign.The Congress further claimed the AAP did not want an alliance, with Kejriwal announcing all 70 candidates early on.The rise of AAP in Delhi has been congruous with the decline of the Congress. In 2013, AAP won 28 seats with a 29.49% vote share, while the Congress tally decreased to 8 seats from 43 in 2008. In 2015, Congress suffered a 15% decline in its vote share, while the AAP saw its support base rise by around 15%.While AAP's welfare schemes, such as free electricity and bus travel for women, initially garnered support, a lack of focus on infrastructure development and maintenance became a significant issue.The poor condition of roads and sewers across Delhi angered voters.Overflowing drains, potholed roads, and irregular garbage collection contributed to the party's unpopularity.The AAP's control over the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) meant it could not deflect blame for these issues onto the BJP. Voters in middle- and upper-middle-class areas were particularly affected by the deteriorating infrastructure.AAP's origins trace back to Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption movement, positioning the party as an alternative to the Congress in 2013.While AAP secured mandates in 2015 and 2020, their repeated promises and ""freebies"" seem to have lost their appeal.The promise of piped water connections for all in 2015 remains unfulfilled, as does the promise of full statehood for Delhi and the ""Rozgar Budget"" aimed at creating 20 lakh jobs.Kejriwal himself admitted that he had failed to fulfill three promises: cleaning the Yamuna, providing clean drinking water, and upgrading Delhi's roads. This acknowledgment gave the BJP an opportunity to attack the AAP, with Amit Shah mocking Kejriwal's promise to purify the Yamuna.The BJP's campaign strategy focused primarily on targeting Arvind Kejriwal and his government, rather than emphasising Hindutva, as it has often done during campainging in other state elections as well as previous Delhi polls.This approach likely resonated with a broader segment of the population, including those who may not have been inclined to support a religiously charged campaign. By focusing on issues such as corruption and governance, the BJP effectively undermined AAP's credibility and appealed to a wider range of voters.The BJP also focused on hyper-local issues such as air pollution, traffic, and public safety, and engaged with local Resident Welfare Associations. They also promoted central government schemes.The BJP also targeted specific demographics, including Purvanchalis and slum dwellers, and utilised an aggressive digital campaign with AI-enhanced content and memes targeting AAP.The BJP's consistent performance in the Lok Sabha polls in Delhi indicated a latent voter base that the party successfully mobilised this time around for the assembly elections.Despite AAP's strong performance in the assembly elections, the BJP had consistently swept Lok Sabha elections in the national capital, winning all seven seats.This pre-existing support base provided a foundation for the BJP's campaign and likely contributed to their victory.The BJP also strategically fielded Parvesh Verma, a strong Jat leader, in the New Delhi constituency, signaling their intention to win back the confidence of the Jat community, which had previously favoured AAP in Delhi elections.During the Delhi Assembly elections, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched strong criticisms against Arvind Kejriwal, which may have been payback for events in Haryana. Gandhi's attacks covered a range of issues, including alleged corruption, unfulfilled promises, and inaction on key issues.Like the BJP, Gandhi attacked Kejriwal over the alleged liquor scam and accused him of living in a ""Sheesh Mahal"" while engaging in corrupt practices.Gandhi said that Kejriwal made false promises, ""similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi"", particularly regarding cleaning the Yamuna River. He also challenged Kejriwal to drink Delhi's tap water, implying it was still polluted despite promises to clean it.The Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) win in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) in 2022 proved to be a double-edged sword, ultimately hurting the party instead of helping it. AAP had promised a cleaner city with world-class roads, but it fell short on both accounts. The MCD House was in limbo, and the Standing Committee, which controls all financial powers, was never formed. The AAP repeatedly accused the Centre of creating hurdles through the Lieutenant Governor and stalling projects.This time around, voters held the AAP accountable for the deteriorating civic infrastructure across Delhi.AAP's performance in the MCD was a letdown for the people of Delhi. The party failed to address critical issues such as clearing garbage, repairing roads, and cleaning clogged sewers. Erratic water supply and overflowing sewers that were never repaired because Rs 4,000 crore for the Delhi Jal Board was not released further hurt the party.Senior party leaders stated that the MCD functioning had collapsed under the AAP, and no work was being done, leading to frustration among councillors.The steady departure of senior leaders from AAP over time might have also weakened the party's organisational structure and public image.The exit of prominent figures like Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Mayank Gandhi, and Kumar Vishwas, who had dared to disagree with Arvind Kejriwal, and repeatedly accused Kejriwal of having an ""autocratic"" style of leadership.Resignation of senior leaders like Kailash Gahlot, who cited the party's focus on political agenda over fulfilling promises, along with internal challenges, signalled internal discord.The BJP had termed Gahlot's resignation a ""courageous move"".Negative campaigning by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) centered on issues like Yamuna River pollution, the Delhi Police, and the Election Commission (EC) may have affected public perception of the AAP government.In the lead up to the polls, Kejriwal accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna River, which supplies drinking water to Delhi. He claimed that the Haryana government deliberately sent polluted waters to Delhi to create an artificial water scarcity and blame the AAP.The AAP also repeatedly levelled accusations of voter fraud and irregularities against the BJP as well as the EC.AAP alleged that the Election Commission and Delhi Police were shielding BJP workers and accused them of ""hooliganism"". Kejriwal wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner, expressing concern over the intimidation and harassment of AAP volunteers by BJP workers. The EC responded that no written complaints could be traced in most cases but assured that all registered complaints are investigated.Kejriwal further criticised the Election Commission for allegedly refusing to make Form 17C public, a document detailing the number of votes polled at each booth. AAP then launched a website, transparentelections.in, claiming to upload Form 17C data for all constituencies to present the data in an accessible format.The EC dismissed Kejriwal's claims regarding Form 17C, stating that copies had already been provided to polling agents at each booth after voting, as per Rule 49S of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.","BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes.
