CBI raids Bhupesh Baghel's residence; former Chhattisgarh CM reacts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cbi-conducts-searches-at-former-chhattisgarh-cm-bhupesh-baghels-residence/articleshow/119511641.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Central Bureau of Investigation on Wednesday conducted searches at the residence of former Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel.According to officials, the investigating agency raided Baghel's residences in Raipur and Bhilai, as well as the residential premises of a senior police officer and a close associate of the former chief minister.Reacting to the raids, Baghel suggested that the actions were taken to prevent him from attending a key Congress meeting scheduled for April 8 and 9 in Ahmedabad.Taking to X, Baghel said, ""Now the CBI has arrived. Today, former Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel is scheduled to travel to Delhi for a meeting of the 'Drafting Committee' formed for the AICC meeting to be held in Ahmedabad (Gujarat) on the upcoming 8th and 9th of April.""""Even before that, the CBI has already reached his residences in Raipur and Bhilai,"" he added.This comes days after the Enforcement Directorate raided Baghel's residence in connection with an alleged liquor scam.The central investigating agency seized approximately Rs 30 lakh in cash, using a counting machine, at the former chief minister’s residence.The probe was linked to an alleged liquor scam that the central agency believes caused a ""massive loss"" to the state exchequer. Authorities claim that those involved in the liquor syndicate had siphoned off around Rs 2,161 crore through various schemes.The ED investigation so far has revealed that the liquor syndicate operated between 2019 and 2022, generating a large amount of illegal commissions through multiple methods. One of the ways was to collect bribes from the distillers for each liquor 'case' procured by the state liquor body.The alleged scam also involved the sale of country liquor from state-run shops, which remained entirely unaccounted for. The ED believes that not a single rupee reached the state exchequer, with all the money pocketed by the syndicate suspects.","Bhupesh Baghel suggested that the actions were taken to prevent him from attending a key Congress meeting scheduled for April 8 and 9.

PM set to open new bridge to Rameswaram on Ram Navami,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-set-to-open-new-bridge-to-rameswaram-on-ram-navami/articleshow/119509551.cms,"NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to inaugurate the new Pamban bridge in Tamil Nadu on Ram Navami (April 6), which will improve rail connectivity to Rameswaram - one of the holiest Hindu pilgrimage sites.Rameswaram is believed to be the place where Lord Ram built the bridge to Lanka, as recounted in the Ramayana, to defeat Ravan. Over 25 lakh pilgrims visit the Rameswaram temple annually and the upgraded infrastructure is expected to be a bigger boost to tourism and pilgrimage.As far as symbolisms go, the significance of the likelihood of PM inaugurating the bridge on the day of Ram Navami, the day when Hindus believe Lord Ram was born, is big enough. But what makes it even more interesting is the timing of the likely inauguration-when DMK govt in Tamil Nadu has virtually been on a warpath against Centre over the language issue and yet-to-be announced delimination.The new bridge, country's first vertical sea bridge, is expected to ensure greater comfort for travellers.Sources said the preparation for commercial opening of the sea bridge is in full swing and top railway officials from Southern Railway have been inspecting the bridge and the Rameswaram railway station in the past few days. The inauguration is likely soon after the PM returns from his two-day trip (April 4 and 5) to Sri Lanka, they added.The little over 2-km rail bridge is an engineering marvel that reconnects the mainland to Rameswaram Island, replacing the old corroded bridge. The old bridge constructed in 1914 was the only link between Rameswaram and the mainland, and was a cultural icon for over 110 years. This was the country's first sea bridge and was a lifeline for locals, pilgrims, and traders. Exposure to saltwater and aging infrastructure caused severe corrosion, which eventually led to its closure in 2022.Officials said the new one isn't just a replacement, but a more modern and efficient one as it can accommodate growing traffic volumes, ensure durability and facilitate maritime navigation.

Chadha asked in the Upper House of the Parlaiment.He questioned whether India was falling behind in AI and if the country would be able to develop its own generative AI model.Citing data from 2010 to 2022, Chadha said that 60 per cent of the world’s AI patents were registered by the United States and 20 per cent by China. ""Between 2010 and 2022, 60 per cent of the world's AI patents were registered by the USA, and 20 per cent by China.

It is true that the USA and China have a head start of four to five years, but this is because they have invested in their research, academia, and AI development,"" Chadha said.""It is said that 15 per cent of the total AI workforce consists of Indians. Around 4,50,000 Indian AI professionals are working in foreign countries. This means that India has talent, hardworking people, brainpower, and a digital economy. However, despite all this, India has become a consumer of AI today, not a producer,"" Chadha further said.He also noted that India has over 90 crore internet users, yet the country is primarily an AI consumer rather than a producer.Chadha also referred to OpenAI founder Sam Altman’s comments, where he described India's AI potential as ""disappointing."" He urged the government to focus on becoming a producer of AI.To strengthen India’s position in AI, Chadha suggested steps such as producing indigenous AI chips, creating a dedicated AI infrastructure fund, providing research grants, offering tax incentives, and preventing talent migration.""The time has come when India should become an AI producer rather than an AI consumer. For this, we need to start making indigenous AI chips in the country. We should start an AI Infra Fund. We should also stop talent migration so that India's top-tier AI talent remains in the country,"" he said.He pointed out that financial investment in AI needs to increase, noting that the US spends 3.5 per cent of its GDP on AI research, China 2.5 per cent, while India spends only 0.7 per cent.""In the future, the nation that dominates AI will lead the world and become a global guru.

Initially, they were charged under Section 376 of the IPC (rape) and relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.However, the Allahabad HC ruled that their actions did not qualify as rape or an attempt to rape but instead fell under the lesser charge of aggravated sexual assault , punishable under Section 354(B) IPC and Section 9(m) of the POCSO Act The high court’s ruling was based on the argument that ""an attempt to commit rape must go beyond the stage of preparation and actual attempt to commit an offence consists chiefly in the greater degree of determination.""""The specific allegation against Akash is that he tried to drag the victim beneath the culvert and broke the string of her pyjama. It is also not stated by witnesses that due to this act of the accused the victim got naked or got undressed.

SC order sets benchmark for fines in tree-felling cases

NEW DELHI: Observing that the act of cutting a large number of trees was worse than killing a human being, Supreme Court on Tuesday said no mercy should be shown to people who damage the environment and approved imposing a fine of Rs 1 lakh for each illegally cut tree.Sending out a clear message that those indulging in illegal cutting of trees without approval from the authority concerned and damaging the environment must be dealt with an iron hand, a bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan rejected the plea of a man who had cut down 454 trees in the protected Taj Trapezium Zone.The bench accepted the suggestion of senior advocate ADN Rao, who is assisting the court as amicus curiae, that a clear message needed to be sent to offenders that the law and trees could not, and should not, be taken for granted. With its order, the court has set a benchmark on how much fine should be imposed in such cases.“No mercy in environmental case. Felling a large number of trees is worse than killing a human. It will take at least 100 years minimum to again regenerate or recreate the green cover created by 454 trees which were blatantly cut without permission of this court though the embargo imposed by this court is right from the year 2015,” the bench said.The court accepted the report of the central empowered committee (CEC), which recommended a fine of Rs 1 lakh per tree for 454 trees which were cut last year by one Shiv Shankar Agarwal. Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for him, told the bench that his client had admitted the mistake and apologised and urged the court to reduce the fine amount, which he said was exorbitant. He also said Agarwal should be allowed to do plantations at a nearby site and not on the same plot. Refusing to reduce the fine amount, the court, however, allowed him to do plantations in nearby areas.In its report, CEC said 454 trees were illegally felled on the night of Sept 18 last year out of which 422 trees were on private land known as Dalmia Farm situated at Vrindavan Chatikara Road, and the remaining 32 trees were on the roadside strip adjoining this private land which was a protected forest.Observing that the report revealed the shocking state of affairs and blatant violation of the SC’s order, the bench initiated contempt proceedings against Agarwal and asked CEC to suggest further measures to be taken against him.The panel suggested that the forest department should recover the penalty due under the provisions of UP Protection of Trees Act, 1976, for this illegal felling and the department should also take punitive action against the land owner for felling 32 trees that were in the protected forest as per the provisions under the Indian Forest Act, 1972",SC order sets benchmark for fines in tree-felling cases.

Nishant suggested that performing a ritual for Rs 6,300 could cleanse his life of negativity, police told news agency PTI.The software engineer, after a week of rumination, decided to go ahead with the ponzi prophecy.He reached out to Nishant, who assured him that a "" Bade Maharaj "" would personally conduct the sacred '' to heal his fate.""Nishant facilitated the conversation between the software engineer and Bade Maharaj through a conference call,"" according to the FIR. Later, what followed makes a classic case of spiritual extortion .Bade Maharaj demanded Rs 15,300 to begin the ritual and later added another Rs 28,000 under different reasons. Trusting their words, the victim made the payments electronically, police confirmed.When the techie asked for proof that the rituals had been performed, the fraudsters turned up the pressure.""When the victim demanded proof that rituals were performed by Bade Maharaj, the latter called up in the night and demanded an additional Rs 20,000, saying some rituals are incomplete,"" police said.The software engineer, skeptical but scared, hesitated. That’s when the fear tactics escalated.Bade Maharaj told him that incomplete rituals could harm his life. With panic creeping in, the victim found himself tangled deeper in the scam.Nishant reconnected him with Bade Maharaj, and by this time, he had transferred Rs 2.41 lakh. But the fraudsters weren’t done yet.The psychological pressure intensified—warnings of impending doom if the rituals weren't completed pushed the victim into financial freefall.He maxed out his credit cards, borrowed from private lenders, and continued paying, desperate to ""fix"" his cosmic misfortune. Over six days in January, the techie had drained Rs 12.20 lakh into the scam. The fraudsters still weren’t satisfied.It wasn't until he confided in his friends that he realised he had been played.Urged to investigate, he reached out to the customer support of DevineTalk, where a woman reassured him that the rituals would be completed—and as a gesture of goodwill, she even offered him three free meditation sessions.Skeptical, the techie checked online reviews of DevineTalk and discovered he wasn’t alone—several users had flagged the app for fraudulent activities.On Monday, the techie lodged a formal complaint with the cyber police, leading to an FIR under various sections of the BNS and the Information Technology Act (ITA).","A Mumbai-based techie turned to ""astrology"" in a bid to mend his life, unaware the only thing that was to align for him were not stars but a well-planned scam.

The case pertains to razing of the houses of a lawyer, a professor, and others in 2021.A bench of Justices Abhay Oka and N Kotishwar Singh, based on the claim by the aggrieved, took exception to the manner in which demolition was carried out and termed it the state's high-handedness. ""It shocks the conscience of the court the manner in which within 24 hours of the notice it was done,"" it said.The UP govt, however, disputed the version of the petitioners that the demolition squad had moved in a day after notices were served on them.Attorney general R Venkataramani, appearing for the state, argued that reasonable time was given to the petitioners to respond to the notice. He said on Dec 8, 2020, they were given the first notice, followed by notices in Jan 2021 and March 2021. The petitioners said the demolition notice was issued March 1, 2021, served on March 6, 2021, and demolition carried out on March 7.The petitioners said they were not given a reasonable opportunity to challenge the demolition notice before the appellate authority under Section 27(2) of the UP Urban Planning and Development Act.""State must act very fairly and state must give reasonable time to enable them to file an appeal before the structures are demolished. Notice served on March 6 and demolition carried out on March 7. Now, we will allow them to reconstruct,"" the bench said.The bench pointed out that the notices were served by affixture, which is not the method approved by the law and only the last notice was served through the legally recognised method.""Therefore, we are going to pass order only in the light of these facts. The manner in which the whole process has been conducted... the court cannot tolerate such a process. If we tolerate in one case, it will continue. We will pass an order that they can reconstruct at their own cost and if the appeal fails, then they will have to demolish at their own cost,"" it said.The court asked the petitioners to file an undertaking and adjourned the case. The petitioners in the case are advocate Zulfiqar Haider, Prof Ali Ahmed and three other individuals. They moved the apex court after Allahabad high court dismissed their plea against the demolition.The video of an eight-year-old girl clutching her books and running away from her shanty during an anti-encroachment drive in Ambedkar Nagar’s Jalalpur area in UP has sparked widespread outrage.The footage, which surfaced on social media, showed an earthmover revving nearby, drawing sharp criticism from opposition parties. Former UP CM and SP president Akhilesh Yadav condemned the demolition, calling it an example of the state’s deteriorating condition.On Monday, he posted on X, “Eight years, UP ruined, and only questions remain.” He also shared an AI-generated image of a girl holding books while a bulldozer loomed in the background.

Several states, however, have doled out higher increases on an ad hoc basis in their legislatures.Govt sources said the mechanism introduced in 2018 ensures a fair and transparent approach to salary revisions, preventing arbitrary increases and ensuring financial prudence.The Finance Act, 2018, amended the Salaries, Allowances and Pension of Members of Parliament Act, 1954, to link MPs' salaries to inflation, specifically using the cost inflation index (CII) published under the Income Tax Act, 1961. The sources said before this amendment, salary revisions were conducted on an ad hoc basis and required parliamentary approval each time. The amendment aimed to ""depoliticise the process and introduce a systematic mechanism for salary adjustments"", they said.The last revision before the 2018 amendment took place in 2010, when Parliament passed a bill to increase MPs' monthly salaries from Rs 16,000 to Rs 50,000, the sources said. This decision led to significant public criticism, as many perceived it as MPs granting themselves a three-fold pay hike.However, some MPs, including Mulayam Singh Yadav and Lalu Prasad Yadav,demanded at least a five-fold rise in salaries, the sources said.","The Finance Act, 2018, amended the Salaries, Allowances and Pension of Members of Parliament Act, 1954, to link MPs' salaries to inflation.

Amit Shah rules out centralisation of power for disaster management,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amit-shah-rules-out-centralisation-of-power-for-disaster-management/articleshow/119507567.cms,"NEW DELHI: Parliament passed the Disaster Management (Amendment) Bill, 2024, on Tuesday with home minister Amit Shah saying there will be no centralisation of power or discrimination with states in handling disasters.Replying to the debate on the bill in Rajya Sabha, Shah said timely reforms were essential to prevent outdated systems from collapsing. He also launched a sharp attack on Congress's management of the PM's Relief Fund, accusing the previous UPA regime of lacking accountability and transparency.The bill was passed in Lok Sabha in Dec 2024.On the need for the amendments, Shah said, ""Some members asked what is the need for amendment. I want to tell them that if a building is not repaired in time, it collapses. They think that maybe, they will come and change it but nobody's turn will come for the next 15-20 years. Whatever has to be done, we have to do it. The Disaster Management Act was implemented for the first time in 2005. Under this, NDMA, SDMA and DDMA were formed. Now, concerns are being expressed that there will be centralisation of power. If you read the entire bill carefully, then the biggest responsibility of implementation lies with the District Disaster Management Authority which is under the state govt. Therefore, there is no possibility of harming the federal structure anywhere.""Shah emphasised that the amendment prioritised shifting from reactive disaster response to proactive risk reduction. He outlined several key measures, including real-time monitoring using AI-based systems instead of manual processes, enhanced communication strategies, moving from traditional radio announcements to digital platforms, mobile alerts and social media notifications. The reforms also aimed to expand disaster response beyond being govt-centric to a multi-dimensional, society-involved approach, he added.He also underscored India's significant progress in disaster management, which has earned both national and international recognition.

NEW DELHI: Noting that the application to disqualify three BRS MLAs who allegedly defected to Congress is pending for almost a year before the Telangana assembly speaker, Supreme Court on Tuesday asked why there no decision has been taken one way or the other. The court wondered if the decision would be taken after the assembly's term ends.Hearing a plea filed by BRS MLAs seeking the court's direction to the speaker to decide within four weeks, a bench of Justices B R Gavai and A G Masih said it is prima facie of the view that the court can interfere if the decision is not taken within a reasonable time.The Supreme Court bench said certain observations passed by SC in the Subhash Desai case (Shiv Sena rift matter) favour BRS which seeks disqualification of its MLAs.“As on today, how much time has passed since the first application? It appears to be a year. Why has not the Speaker’s office set a deadline for deciding these petitions?” the court observed.Senior advocates C A Sundaram and D Seshadri Naidu, appearing for BRS MLAs seeking the disqualification, told the bench high court had in Sept 2024 asked the Speaker to fix a hearing schedule within four weeks but no notice was issued until Jan this year.They said one of the defected MLAs had even contested the Lok Sabha polls on Congress ticket and lost and continued to be MLA.They said only after SC passed observation in an earlier hearing, the Speaker issued notice on Feb 13 to MLAs and granted them three weeks time to respond. But that deadline passed and there is no clarity on the status of the disqualification petitions, they told the bench.

NEW DELHI: The newly formed BJP government gave the capital a talking point on Tuesday by presenting an ambitious Rs 1 lakh crore budget for 2025-26, a sharp increase of 31.6% over last year’s outlay of Rs 76,000 crore. Revving up the double engine that now runs the capital, it got valuable support from the Centre in the form of grants and loan, doubling the capital expenditure and allocating funds for various schemes and projects that were promised in the run-up to the assembly polls in Feb this year.Like the AAP government, chief minister Rekha Gupta ’s government, too, has given education the lion’s share with a Rs 19,291-crore allocation, nearly 19.3% of the total outlay (Rs 16,396 crore in 2024-25), followed by Rs 12,952 crore for transport, including roads and bridges (Rs 7,470 crore in 2024-25), and health with Rs 12,893 crore (Rs 8,685 crore in 2024-25).Gupta, who also holds the finance portfolio, announced that her govt was setting aside Rs 5,100 crore for Mahila Samriddhi Yojana — a scheme to provide a monthly grant of Rs 2,500 to poor women aged above 18 — apart from allocating funds to roll out the Ayushman Bharat health scheme, increasing pension for senior citizens, widows and destitute, and constructing decentralised sewage treatment plants to prevent polluted water from flowing into the Yamuna Allocating Rs 9,000 crore for water and sanitation, the CM said her government’s prime responsibility was to provide clean water. She emphasised on bridging the gap between the demand of 1,290mgd and the installed capacity of 1,000mgd.Gupta said her government was going to increase capital expenditure from Rs 15,089 crore in 2024-25 to Rs 28,115 crore for ‘Viksit Delhi’.The govt will take a loan of Rs 15,000 crore from the Centre under the National Small Savings Fund and also receive Rs 12,096 crore as grants and aid from it under various heads. The chief minister also projected an increase of nearly 17% in tax revenue, from Rs 58,750 crore in the 2024-25 budget estimates to Rs 68,700 crore in 2025-26.In her 138-minute-long budget speech, probably the longest in the history of the Delhi assembly, Gupta constantly attacked and taunted the previous AAP government.“The days of corruption, mismanagement and inefficiency are gone with the AAP(da) govt,” she added.Before reaching Vidhan Sabha , the Delhi chief minister visited Hanuman temple at Connaught Place. At Vidhan Sabha, she chaired a meeting of the cabinet before entering the house.In her speech, the CM said her government will focus on 10 key areas in the new financial year. These include infrastructure; industrial development and investment promotion; access to water, sanitation and Yamuna cleaning; health and education for all; tourism, art, language and culture promotion; expanding social security and development; seamless connectivity; efficient irrigation and flood control; power, sustainable development, green growth and pollution control; and smart and good governance. She said a major focus of the budget was the cleaning and rejuvenation of the Yamuna, inspired by the Sabarmati riverfront project. She said her government was allocating Rs 500 crore for Yamuna cleaning, ensuring that only treated water enters the river through the decentralisation of 40 sewage treatment plants (STPs). This was in addition to Rs 500 crore earmarked for the repair and upgradation of STPs and Rs 250 crore for replacing old sewer lines, besides investing in advanced machinery to tackle waste and pollution.Gupta said her govt proposed to create a chief minister development fund with a provision of Rs 1,400 crore for developmental projects, complementing the efforts already made under other schemes and initiatives.The CM announced that the Delhi government will set up 100 Atal canteens across the capital, earmarking Rs 100 crore to fund the project. An education hub in Narela, two new medical colleges, a modern cow shelter, a pilot project for eliminating overhead electric wires, free laptops for 1,200 students passing Class 10, welfare boards for gig workers and auto-taxi drivers, a new industrial policy and a global investment summit were among the key initiatives announced in the budget.To curb alleged corruption in the free bus ride scheme for women, Gupta said the BJP govt will replace pink tickets with smart cards. In a bid to empower women and enhance their safety, Gupta announced a host of welfare schemes, including a monthly honorarium of Rs 2,500, installation of 50,000 CCTV cameras, introduction of pink PCR (all-female police assistance) units and a financial aid of Rs 21,000 for women who are expecting.The CM, however, said her government will run a verification campaign to ensure that the benefits of the schemes reach only the deserving. “The AAP govt ran Delhi's schemes for vote-bank politics, which deprived the people of Delhi and benefited the ineligible. We will now launch a vigorous verification campaign so that illegal immigrants from outside Delhi borders, especially Bangladeshis and Rohingya , do not get benefits under any scheme,” Gupta said.The chief minister said that her government will also establish an integrated command and control centre which will do real-time monitoring of various environmental parameters like air quality, water quality, noise levels and waste management, among others.Gupta attacked the previous AAP governments for allegedly neglecting basic amenities in slum clusters of the city while building a ‘sheesh mahal’. Taking a jibe at the opposition AAP MLAs in the house, Gupta in a lighter vein said that ‘sheesh mahal’ will be included in the tourist circuit.Taking a dig at AAP, Gupta quoted Bashir Badr : “Dil ki basti purani Dilli hai , jo bhi guzra hai usne loota hai (The locality of my heart is old Delhi, whoever has passed through it has looted it).”","BJP government presents ambitious Rs 1 lakh crore budget for 2025-26.

Committed to judiciary's diversity, says Meghwal

NEW DELHI: On a question related to social diversity in higher judicial appointments, law ministry informed Parliament last week that about 78% of judges appointed to different high courts in the last seven years, since 2018, were from upper castes, while minorities and Scheduled Castes & Scheduled Tribes comprised 5% each. Those from OBC category were around 12%.Responding to a question raised by Manoj Jha of RJD in Lok Sabha on Thursday last, law minister Arjun Ram Meghwal said that out of 715 HC judges appointed since 2018, 22 belong to SC category, 16 to ST, 89 to OBC and 37 from minorities. tnnRJD's Manoj Jha recently pointed out in Lok Sabha that the representation of SCs, STs, OBCs, women and minorities in the higher judiciary remains far below the desired level, and sought a statement from the law minister if govt has taken it up with the apex court. He said that there was a declining trend in the appointment of judges from the marginalised communities in recent years and, if govt had approached Supreme Court (SC) to incorporate social diversity in memorandum of procedure (MoP) for judicial appointments.""Appointment of judges to SC and high courts is made under Articles 124, 217 and 224 of the Constitution, which do not provide for reservation for any caste or class of persons,"" Arjun Ram Meghwal said in a written reply.The law minister emphasised that govt was committed to enhancing social diversity and since 2018, those recommended for the post of HC judges are required to provide details regarding their social background in the prescribed format (prepared in consultation with SC). "" Govt has been requesting chief justices of high courts that while sending proposals for appointment of judges, due consideration be given to suitable candidates belonging to SCs, STs, OBCs, minorities and women to ensure social diversity,"" he said.However, he said that there was little govt could do since only those persons who are recommended by the SC collegium are appointed as judges of the constitutional courts.As per the MoP, the responsibility for initiation of proposals for appointment of judges in SC vests with Chief Justice of India , while the responsibility for initiation of proposals for appointment of judges in HCs vests with the chief justice of the concerned HC, he added.","Law ministry informed Parliament last week that about 78% of judges appointed to different high courts in the last seven years, since 2018, were from upper castes.

The aim: to equip them with ""language skills to tap into global job markets while also supporting national security interests amid ongoing border tensions with China"".The project was initiated by Pauri Garhwal DM Ashish Chauhan in 2023, following discussions between former CDS Gen Bipin Rawat and Doon University VC Surekha Dangwal in 2021.""This is the first time in India that Mandarin is being taught in govt schools under such an initiative,"" said Shanky Chandra, HoD (Chinese Studies) at Doon University.The project began on a pilot basis in 2023, and the positive response from students encouraged us to continue.”Chandra added: “Currently, the programme runs in 15 PM SHRI (Pradhan Mantri Schools for Rising India) schools, which have online teaching facilities, as we lack, as of now, the required resources for physical classes.”Fluency in Mandarin — a language with over 50,000 characters — typically requires mastery of at least 3,000 to 5,000 characters, and the intricate writing system and tonal nature of it make it one of the most challenging languages to learn.Chandra, an alumnus of Harvard University, emphasised the project’s potential for creating employment opportunities. “Learning Mandarin will significantly improve job prospects as China is one of India’s largest trade partners. Last year, three of our students who passed Class 12 secured well-paying jobs in the neighbouring country solely due to their language skills.”He said, “Many other opportunities open up as interpreters and translators are hired by the ministry of external affairs and even private companies. Plans are also in place to offer foreign scholarships based on student proficiency tests.”Another faculty member of the university said the experiment could extend beyond economic opportunities and prove beneficial for the country’s national security interests. “Given the border issues with China, there is a growing demand for Mandarin-speaking personnel in defence establishments and security operations. These students could play a crucial role in fulfiling these needs in the future,” he told TOI, requesting anonymity.Commending the efforts of the university, Dangwal said, “We are putting our best into helping the children develop foreign language skills.

SC orders scrutiny of Apollo over EWS intake,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-orders-scrutiny-of-apollo-over-ews-intake/articleshow/119501865.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered the Centre and Delhi government to send a joint team of experts to inspect the records of Apollo Hospital for the last five years to find out whether it had fulfilled its commitment to provide free treatment to 30% indoor and 40% outdoor patients as per the 1994 lease agreement , and stressed that it ""would not hesitate to hand it over to All India Institute of Medical Sciences "" if it was found to be in violation of the agreement under which 15 acres of prime land was given to it at the token rent of Re 1 per month.A bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh referred to the lease agreement, under which land was allotted to Indraprastha Medical Corporation, with Delhi govt having a 26% shareholding, to set up Apollo Hospital on Mathura Road and said, ""We are not sure whether the hospital is providing 200 free beds to poor patients in its indoor facility.""Additional solicitor general S D Anand informed the bench that the 30-year lease of the land allotted to Apollo Hospital had expired, leading the bench to order the Centre and the Delhi govt to set up an expert team to inspect the records of the hospital for the last five years to find out whether it had honoured the lease agreement conditions.The bench asked the Centre and Delhi government to file affidavits informing the court whether the lease period was extended, and if so, the terms and conditions thereof.It also wanted to know what use the land and building were put to if the lease had not been renewed.The Justice Kant-led bench asked the expert team to find out from hospital records the number of poor patients who were given free treatment in outdoor and indoor facilities in the last five years. It directed the hospital management to cooperate with the examination of records by experts.The court also asked the hospital to file an affidavit giving details of free treatment to poor patients and posted the matter for further hearing after four weeks while issuing a warning that ""if the hospital is not being run properly and as per the lease agreement, we will not hesitate to give its running to AIIMS"".Referring to the Sept 22, 2009, judgment of Delhi high court, SC said it was apparent that the hospital management had not adhered to the free treatment obligations stipulated in the lease agreement. It said the HC had issued a series of directions to ensure free treatment to specified percentage of poor patients despite the hospital management taking a stand that it was a commercial venture.Delhi HC had said in its judgment, ""The land was given to the hospital at a token rent of Re 1 per month. In addition to the land, GNCTD contributed substantially to the equity capital as well as to the construction of the hospital. Total investment of the GNCTD is more than Rs 38 crore. It is not permissible for the hospital to turn around and avoid the responsibility undertaken by it under the agreement.""","Supreme Court orders joint team of experts to inspect the records of Apollo Hospital for the last five years.

The fire chief had subsequently denied making any such statement.Besides Justice Varma, the prime witnesses who will be examined by the panel are the first responders to the distress call about the fire in the outhouse storeroom of the judge’s residence on the night of March 14.

Indians on green cards are advised not to panic but to carry relevant documents when returning to the US from abroad,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/indians-on-green-cards-are-advised-not-to-panic-but-to-carry-relevant-documents-when-returning-to-the-us-from-abroad/articleshow/119419156.cms,"Checklist of documents that green card holders should carry with them for re-entry into the US



Valid and unexpired green card (Form I-551) – Ensure it is unexpired.

Passport from home country

Re-entry permit (if applicable) – Needed for those staying abroad for over one year but less than two years

Pay stubs from current employment (last 3 months)

Employment verification letter

Previous year’s W-2 form and federal income tax return copy

US bank account details

US driver’s licence

With a tough immigration policy being followed by the US government and key agencies including the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection ( CBP ), putting green card holders under heightened scrutiny; many Indians who are living and working in the US with legal permanent resident status (green cards) are worried.A recent statement by US Vice-President, JD Vance , that a green card “doesn’t give you an indefinite right to stay in the US”, has sparked concerns among thousands of Indians who are in the US on green cards. However, many experts and immigration attorneys feel that there’s no need to panic for most Indians who are on green cards and may need to travel outside the US, including on visits to India.“Though green cards can be revoked for certain reasons, including national security risks or criminal activity, most Indian professionals are law-abiding and tax-paying individuals. They don’t need to panic. As long as they follow US laws, avoid criminal activities, maintain strong ties to the US, and avoid extended stays abroad, they have little to worry about,” feels Neha Mahajan , co-founder of Skilled Immigrants in America (SIIA), an organisation supporting Indians stuck in long green card queues. She adds that green cards aren’t automatically at risk unless someone engages in actions that violate immigration rules or national security policies.The green card is a status of permanent resident in the US; hence strong ties to the US are important. “One can have multiple residences but the US government wants America to be the permanent residence of green card holders,” says Manjunath Gokare , an attorney based in Atlanta, Georgia, who specialises in immigration. Law requires that the green card holder must live in the US (maintain a home or apartment); maintain employment in the US; file income taxes in the US on all income earned globally; and maintain US bank accounts and driver’s licence.An important factor for green card status is the duration of travel outside the US and long absences are not recommended. “A stay of less than six months outside the US typically does not raise questions. A stay of more than six months but less than one year could result in additional scrutiny upon arrival in the US. A stay beyond one year without a valid re-entry permit (Form I-131) may lead to the presumption that you have abandoned your green card,” says Mumbai-based immigration lawyer, Poorvi Chothani.For green card holders, it is important to keep certain documents with them and to make sure that they are valid and updated. “Keep your green card valid and on you and renew it on time and always carry the original when you are travelling. Keep your US bank account, active health insurance, driver’s licence, and tax records up to date,” says Mahajan. She adds that green card holders should file taxes as resident (1040) and not as non-resident.Given the increased scrutiny at ports of entry, it is wise to carry certain documents for green card holders returning from overseas. “These include pay stubs from your current employment (last 3 months); employment verification letter and last year’s W-2 form and federal income tax return copy,” says Gokare.It is very important for green card holders not to have been convicted of any criminal offences (classified under US immigration laws as aggravated felonies) that render them deportable or removable, under US immigration laws.“If one is maintaining their permanent residence in the US and does not have any criminal convictions, then there is nothing to worry about. Green card holders that are targeted by CBP, typically have either residency issues or removable criminal convictions,” says Gokare. He adds that green card holders who believe that they have always complied with the law, but are yet facing issues at the port of entry, should ask the CBP officers to set up a ‘deferred inspection’.“With an appointment for deferred inspection, a green card holder is allowed to provide evidence and can be accompanied by a lawyer when they meet with CBP officers to present their case as to how they are maintaining permanent residence in the US,” he says.If faced with tough questions at a US border, green card holders are advised not to sign any forms; including Form I-407; which is the record of abandonment of legal permanent residence status; without consulting their lawyers, even if there is pressure from CBP. “No one is legally required to sign it. If they refuse, CBP cannot unilaterally strip them of their green card without due process,” says Chothani.Despite providing evidence of resident status and ties to the US, if CBP officials ask green card holders to renounce their green cards on arrival, there are still certain potential recourse measures that can be taken up.“Those who have been outside the US for an extended period should be prepared for questioning by CBP officers. If placed in secondary inspection, it is best to remain calm and provide clear responses regarding ties to the US,” says Chothani.Secondary inspections can take up to two hours to clear and Gokare advises anyone facing such inspections to co-operate with the officers and not get alarmed. Even if CBP insists that a green card holder is inadmissible or has abandoned their green card, they can still request a notice to appear before an immigration judge. This allows them to fight the case in immigration court rather than surrendering the green card at the airport.“If an individual’s green card is revoked, they may still have a few options including filing for a motion with the USCIS or immigration court to reopen or reconsider and applying for a returning resident visa to regain LPR status,” Chothani says.Finally, five years after getting their green cards, those who are eligible can consider US citizenship. “It’s the best way to make sure you don’t have to worry about losing your status,” says Mahajan. She adds that green card holders should stay engaged; follow rules and not let small mistakes put their status at risk.","A recent statement by US Vice-President, JD Vance, has sparked concerns among thousands of Indians who are in the US on green cards.

Elon Musk Tesla Latest News: Tesla investor who called for Elon Musk's exit says Board should not have allowed him to purchase Twitter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tesla-investor-who-called-for-elon-musks-exit-says-board-should-not-have-allowed-him-to-purchase-twitter/articleshow/119351660.cms,"Some Tesla investors want Elon Musk to step down from the CEO post.

Can Elon Musk be removed as CEO?

Long-time Tesla investor Ross Gerber, the CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, who called for Elon Musk 's exit from the company has now said that the Tesla Board should have never let him purchase Twitter as that started Elon Musk's distraction from Tesla. ""Why has the board of directors sat quietly while so much brand value has been eroded to the point that cars are being set on fire?"" he said. ""It's been wildly negligent that the board has done nothing to curb Elon's behavior, especially around extremist statements.""Gerber's statement came as shares of Tesla dropped in the wake of massive protests against Elon Musk inside the country and also outside. Hundreds of Tesla vehicles have been set on fire showing anger against Elon's interference in the government decisions. The arson incidents are being treated as 'domestic terrorism' by the Donald Trump administration who sympathized with Elon at this time of crisis.Elon, however, brushed aside the emergency and adviced shareholders to hold on to their shares -- in a surprised all-hands meeting of Tesla.Gerber said the Tesla Board can't do anything against Musk as it solely functions for the benefit of Elon and is highly compensated by him. ""They're not going to do anything he doesn't say,"" Gerber said.Newsweek reported that Tesla shareholders don't have the power to directly vote to remove the CEO. But they could influence the Board if they believe Musk's leadership endangers their investment. ""An ouster would likely occur if enough board members—facing pressure from large investors—determined that Musk's actions or controversies significantly harmed Tesla's performance or reputation,"" David Park, professor of entrepreneurship at Syracuse University, told Newsweek.Gerber believes Tesla is suffering because of Elon Musk's involvement with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) -- the department that he has been leading solely after Vivek Ramaswamy's exit. DOGE has a mandate to cut the government spending within a year and after that DOGE is supposed to stop functioning.As the world's wealthiest individual, Musk has assumed a prominent position in President Donald Trump's second term, heading DOGE. However, his engagement in politics has sparked investor unease, leading to Tesla's poor market performance throughout 2025.In 2025, Tesla's share value has declined by 37 per cent, following Musk's controversial political statements and decisions. Recent weeks have also witnessed increasing incidents of Tesla vehicles being targeted for vandalism including gunshots fired at Tesla dealerships, or targeted in arson attacks.Read more: Tesla arson attacks investigated as 'domestic terrorism,' backed by radical group tied to 2020 riots","Ross Gerber, the CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, called for Elon Musk's exit from the company.

A Father's Plea For Justice

Harshita Brella's body was discovered in the boot of a car in Ilford, London, on November 14, 2024, after her family was notified by local police through Interpol.



Harshita's father, Satbir Singh, recounts her struggles with domestic violence and expresses his desire for justice against her husband, Pankaj Lamba, whom the family believes is responsible for her murder.



Harshita Brella suffered abuse and financial exploitation during her marriage to Pankaj Lamba, who allegedly took money from her and subjected her to physical violence, leading her to seek help from authorities.



The Brella family suspects that Harshita's murder was premeditated and facilitated by Pankaj Lamba's family, who did not show any concern after her death and failed to report her missing.

NEW DELHI: The Delhi High Court on Monday deferred to March 26 the hearing of a petition related to the alleged murder of city resident Harshita Brella in London. The matter was scheduled before the single-judge bench of Justice Sachin Dutta, said advocate Rushabh Aggarwal, counsel for the petitioner.In February, Brella’s sister Sonia Daba had filed a petition in HC stating concerns that the MEA was not adequately following up with UK authorities to expedite the investigation. During the hearing, HC directed the ministry to appoint a nodal officer in the matter to liaise with her and the investigating agencies in the UK, ensuring a smooth exchange of information and updates related to the case.Brella’s body was found in the boot of a silver Vauxhall Corsa in Ilford on Nov 14 last year, following which an investigation was launched. The news reached her father in India through the local police, which conveyed a message from Interpol UK via Interpol India.""We urged her to return after the incidents of extreme domestic violence , but she told us she couldn't return as she had filed a complaint and there were rules,"" recalls Satbir Singh, father of 24-year-old Harshita Brella, who was murdered in Corby, UK, recently. The grieving father is fighting for justice from his humble residence in Sadh Nagar, Palam, south-west Delhi, hoping that Harshita's husband, Pankaj Lamba , is given the harshest punishment he deserves.""She was as innocent as a kid,"" says her elder sister, Sonia Dabas, as her voice quivers in sorrow. ""She always thought if she was good to others, others would be good to her."" Recalling how they were inseparable as siblings, Sonia says, ""We never needed a third person. We were engrossed in each other's company."" She remembers Harshita as a person 'full of life', enjoying food and shopping on the streets of GK and Sarojini Nagar.Born and raised in Delhi, Harshita attended Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya in Dwarka and later pursued Hindi (Hons) at Venkateswara College in Delhi University. After completing her B Ed, she began tutoring students. ""Parents often said they won't ever find a teacher like her,"" Sonia remembers.Despite her wish to pursue teaching, Harshita eventually agreed to marry after a proposal came through relatives. The family agreed too. But little did they know what lay ahead. ""We were told Pankaj worked for a good company,"" her sister recalls. ""But later, we discovered he was a security guard, a job he was forced to leave. Then he took up a pizza delivery job,"" says Sonia.The wedding took place on March 21, 2024, at a farmhouse in Bijwasan. A few days later, Pankaj left for the UK, and Harshita joined him a month later in April.""Initially, Harshita faced some challenges adjusting to the new life but continued to stay positive,"" recalls her sister. It wasn't until domestic abuse began that she reached out to her family for help. Harshita confided in them, revealing the hardships she was facing.Singh recalls a call from Harshita while she was running on the streets of an unfamiliar country in the middle of the night. ""She called me and told me what had happened. She then called one of her colleagues, also an Indian. I asked her to run towards her colleague,"" he shares. ""That night, Harshita was thrashed by Pankaj. When she tried to escape, he chased her down the street, assaulting her and hurling abusive words at her.""It was then that Harshita approached the authorities for help. She stayed at her colleague's house for a couple of days and then under police protection, as per family members. ""She suffered a miscarriage during this time. Harshita was not only physically abused but financially drained. Pankaj regularly took money from her using various excuses—whether for groceries or friends. When they lived together, he made her work extra hours for more money, even on her days off. When she came home, she had to do all the housework. She wasn't even allowed to talk to anyone,"" recalls Sonia.The last time Harshita called her family, it was around midnight in India. ""She told my mother that she should sleep as they had to attend a wedding the next day,"" Sonia recalls. Days passed, but Harshita's family could not reach her. Then, on Nov 15, 2024, her father received the devastating news. ""I got a call from one of the Dwarka police stations, and the person said, 'Your daughter has been murdered'. I was alone at home when I came to know of this.""Harshita would have turned 25 on Christmas Day, but tragically, she never lived to see it. Her body was found in the boot of a car in East London, four days after her death. Investigators believe she was strangled by Pankaj on Nov 10, 2024, in Corby, Northamptonshire.The family claims they were being pressured for dowry. ""On Sep 14, Pankaj's relatives came to our house and threatened us, demanding more dowry, despite already receiving a significant amount during the wedding,"" says the father.The family also believes that Pankaj planned her murder, and his family helped him evade the law. ""They did not attend the funeral, nor did they reach out when they learned of Harshita's death. Both Harshita and Pankaj were missing, yet Pankaj's family did not file a missing person report. Why?"" Singh questions.Praying for justice, Singh says, ""We want Pankaj to be given the punishment he deserves.""Key highlights","Harshita Brella's body was discovered in the boot of a car in Ilford, London, on November 14, 2024, after her family was notified by local police through Interpol. The Delhi High Court on Monday deferred to March 26 the hearing of a petition related to the alleged murder of Harshita. Brella suffered abuse and financial exploitation during her marriage to Pankaj Lamba.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119457238,imgsize-86438,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/119457238.jpg"

Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams partners with Google Inc. to introduce Artificial Intelligence integrated pilgrim services, making it the first Hindu temple trust globally to do so.



The integration of AI aims to significantly reduce waiting times for devotees seeking free Darshan of Lord Venkateswara at Tirumala.



The Tirupati trust has resolved to reclaim 20 acres of land previously allocated for the Science City project, which did not materialize.



A new trust will be established to merge the Srivani trust and its funds, with a focus on constructing new temples in India and abroad, as well as restoring dilapidated temples.



The trust has decided to restore the VIP break Darshan slot to early morning hours at 5 am on a trial basis in response to complaints from devotees.

TIRUPATI: Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams is set to become the first Hindu temples trust in the world to rollout fascinating Artificial Intelligence integrated pilgrim services by inking a pact with global tech giant Google Inc.Following the TTD trust board meeting held at Tirumala on Monday, Chairman BR Naidu, EO J Syamala Rao and Additional EO Ch Venkaiah Chowdary told reporters that AI systems will be adopted and integrated with various pilgrim services at Tirumala to ensure a hassle free pilgrimage to the multitude of devotees.While specific details of this pact between the TTD and Google are being worked out, one key deliverable which is anticipated by the Tirupati trust is a considerable reduction in the waiting hours for the common devotees availing the free Darshan of Lord Venkateswara.Among other key decisions taken during the trust board meeting, the Tirupati trust has resolved to get the 35 acres of land allocated to Mumtaz hotels and Devalok projects near Alipiri and also decided to take over an extent of 15 acres of land belonging to AP tourism which is located adjacent to the site allocated to the Mumtaz group of hotels.TTD chairman further explained that the Tirupati trust will allocate an extent of 50 acres of land elsewhere to the tourism department. “Following the instructions of Chief minister Nara Chandrababu Naidu, TTD will take upon the responsibility of prohibiting any construction activity between the Zoo park road and Kapilateertham stretch to preserve the sanctity of the Tirumala hills”, BR Naidu asserted.Similarly, TTD trust board also resolved to reclaim an extent of 20 acres of land allocated for the Science city project in Tirupati, which never took off.On the other hand, the Tirupati trust has resolved to speed up the process of establishing a new trust and merge Srivani trust into it along with it’s funds to the tune or approximately Rs.1400 cr. “This new trust will be entrusted with the responsibility of constructing new temples within India and abroad. This trust will also extend financial assistance for the construction of dilapidated temples and for construction of smaller Hindu temples”, BR Naidu told reporters.TTD chairman further explained that he had written letters to the Chief ministers of various Indian states, seeking allocation of land for construction of Lord Venkateswara Swamy temples. “While some CMs have expressed their willingness, CMs of certain other Indian states are yet to respond. AP CM has expressed his willingness to approach the CM’s of those states who haven’t responded yet to the TTD plea, seeking allocation of land to the Tirupati trust”, BR Naidu added.Another significant decision taken by the TTD trust was to restore the VIP break Darshan slot to the early morning hours on a trial basis. “We have received numerous complaints from the devotees, seeking the TTD to restore the VIP break Darshan slot to 5 am in the morning and hence it was resolved to initiate a trial run.Meanwhile, EO J Syamala Rao told reporters that the TTD will initiate immediate measures to renovate and refurbish both VIP and general accommodation blocks at Tirumala to ensure the devotees coming on a pilgrimage to the hill town have access to the best of accommodation services at affordable and subsidised rentals.TTD board members Dr Suchitra Ella, G Bhanuprakash Reddy, Vemireddy Prashanti Reddy, Panabaka Lakshmi and others took part.","Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams partners with Google Inc. to introduce Artificial Intelligence integrated pilgrim services.

IIT Madras to establish campus at Auroville near Puducherry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/iit-madras-to-establish-campus-at-auroville-near-puducherry/articleshow/119437697.cms,"CHENNAI: A new IIT Madras campus will come up at Auroville near Puducherry, focusing on sustainability. “It will be the fourth campus of IIT Madras. Auroville will be giving us 100 acres. We will set up a sustainability campus aligned to the objectives of Auroville. A test track for electric trucks will be set up as one of the first facilities on 20 acres,” director V Kamakoti told reporters on Monday.The testing track will be part of the Centre of Excellence for Zero Emission Trucking ( CoEZET ). “We already have a satellite campus at Thaiyur, a foreign campus in Zanzibar, besides the main campus. The new campus will come into operation in the next 2-3 months. About 45% of fuel is consumed by trucks. If we cut down consumption by 50%, it will make a significant impact on carbon emissions.”Union additional secretary for the ministry of heavy industries Hanif Qureshi said, “Unfortunately, India was a little late in adopting electric vehicles (EVs). The focus is not only on increasing the EVs. The condition is that they must be indigenous.”Of the 32,500 electric chargers in the country, 60% to 70% are slow, he said. “About 40% to 50% of the cost of EVs comes from batteries as they have to be imported,” he said, urging researchers to develop battery technology for cheaper prices. Qureshi launched the EV battery engineering lab, focusing on key aspects of battery technology, and the battery charging infrastructure lab.IIT-M also launched a web-enabled MTech in eMobility, a programme for working professionals in EV technology, and a certificate programme on eMobility, a 100-hour online course on cutting-edge knowledge in EVs. A report on the safe electrification of battery electric trucks for inflammable and hazardous goods transportation and a report on failure modes and effects analysis for battery electric trucks were released.Preeti Banzal, senior scientist from the principal scientific advisor’s office, P K Banerjee, executive director, Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers, Manu Santhanam, dean, Industrial Consultancy and Sponsored Research, IIT-M, C S Shankar Ram, head, department of engineering design, Karthick Atmanathan, and Ajithkumar T K, chief executive officer CoEZET, were present.","A new IIT Madras campus will come up at Auroville near Puducherry, focusing on sustainability.

New UPI rules starting April 1: Here’s what’s changing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/new-upi-rules-starting-april-1-heres-whats-changing/articleshow/119512700.cms,"What it means for UPI users

National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has announced new directives aimed at enhancing the security and efficiency of Unified Payments Interface (UPI) transactions. These guidelines, set to come into effect on April 1, 2025 require banks, Payment Service Providers (PSPs), and third-party UPI service providers like PhonePe, GPay and Paytm to implement specific measures concerning numeric UPI IDs.According to the NPCI's directive, ""The Banks, PSP App shall use the Mobile Number Revocation List/Digital Intelligence Platform (MNRL/DIP) and update their database accordingly at regular intervals, at least on weekly basis.""As mentioned above, banks and PSPs must utilize the Mobile Number Revocation List/Digital Intelligence Platform (MNRL/DIP) to update their databases at least once a week. This aims to reduce transaction errors caused by outdated or reassigned mobile numbers.According to guidelines from the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), a mobile number that has been disconnected can be reallocated to a new subscriber after a gap of 90 days. Typically, if a subscriber makes no calls, sends no texts, or does not use data on a particular mobile number for three months, it is deactivated by the telecom service provider. These operators then reassign such mobile numbers to another subscriber after a certain time gap. These are known as recycled or churned numbers.With the new UPI guidelines starting April 1, 2025, UPI IDs linked to inactive mobile numbers will be deactivated. If your bank-registered mobile number has been inactive for an extended period, your associated UPI ID will be unlinked, rendering UPI services inaccessible.Users are advised to ensure that their mobile numbers registered with their banks are active and up-to-date. Failure to do so may result in the suspension of UPI services linked to inactive or reassigned numbers. Regularly updating bank records with current mobile numbers will help maintain seamless access to UPI services.Meanwhile, NPCI has also started eliminating “Collect Payments” features from the UPI to address growing frauds. According to an Economic Times report, this pull-payment system will be restricted to only large, verified merchants, while person-to-person collect payments will be capped at Rs 2,000.","National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has announced new directives aimed at enhancing the security and efficiency of Unified Payments Interface (UPI) transactions.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

* IT, Auto stocks shine

* Q3 results season starts

* Positive global cues

* China stocks rise

* Rupee gains

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.
