NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party supremo Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday targeted Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta over her remarks on air pollution, sharing a video of her comments and questioning the scientific basis of her claims.Posting in Hindi on X, Kejriwal wrote: “AQI monitors are installed, water is being sprayed there so that the truth about pollution doesn’t reach the people of Delhi. In other words, there’s a game afoot to hide the figures and make it look like the ‘air is clean’. Second thing – when did this new science come about that AQI has now become temperature?”The video shared by Kejriwal showed Gupta defending water spraying at pollution hotspots. In the clip, she said: “So you will spray (water) at a hotspot. Does spraying water on a monitor bring down the AQI, she questioned.""AQI ek aisa temperature hai, jo kisi bhi instrument se pata chalta hai. Toh usme watering is the only solution. Jo hum kar rahe hai, jo pichli sarkare bhi karti thi, aur wo hotspot pe hi hota hai jahan sabse zyada pollution hoga, wahi toh aap safai karenge (AQI is a kind of measurement that can be detected using any instrument.So watering is the only solution for it. That’s what we are doing — just as previous governments did — and it is done only at the hotspots, where pollution is highest. That’s exactly where you would carry out cleaning.),” she said at a media event.The exchange comes at a time when Delhi continues to battle hazardous air. On Tuesday morning, the city woke up to a layer of smog that reduced visibility across several areas. The AQI stood at 292 at 8 am, falling into the ‘poor’ category. Key locations also recorded worrying readings: 265 around India Gate, 294 at ITO, 282 at Alipur, 253 at Aya Nagar, and 291 at Burari. In Akshardham, Ghazipur and Anand Vihar, the AQI touched 319, categorised as ‘very poor’.The worsening air comes despite ongoing government measures. The Delhi government has formed an Expert Group on Air Pollution Mitigation to advise on long-term strategies and emerging technologies. Headed by retired IAS officer Leena Nandan, the panel includes senior scientists, former CPCB officials, IIT professors and representatives from CAQM and IMD. It will meet monthly and offer sector-specific recommendations, covering transport, industry, waste burning and construction.Rekha Gupta has separately emphasised mist spray technology as a key intervention, saying trials at ITO and other NDMC areas have “shown positive results”. She said 305 mist sprayers are being installed at nine hotspots, alongside measures such as filling potholes, improving road surfaces and encouraging residents to report civic issues to prevent dust and waste-related pollution.",Aam Aadmi Party supremo Arvind Kejriwal targeted Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta over her remarks on air pollution.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday extended greetings to former Congress president Sonia Gandhi on her 79th birthday.“Birthday greetings to Smt. Sonia Gandhi Ji. May she be blessed with a long life and good health,” PM Modi wrote on X.The Congress hailed her “visionary” leadership, crediting her with “transforming” the country through several landmark rights-based laws — a reference to her tenure as chairperson of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA), the Congress-led coalition that governed India from 2004 to 2014.""Laws like MGNREGA, Right to Education, Right to Information, and the National Food Security Act gave millions jobs, hope, education, voice, and dignity. Her lifelong commitment to women’s empowerment, social justice, and inclusive growth continues to uplift millions all across the country. Her grit and dedication inspire us every day,"" the party said.Sonia Gandhi led the Congress from 1998 to 2017, making her the longest-serving president in the party’s history. She later returned as interim chief from 2019 to 2022. In June 2024, she was re-elected as president of the Congress Parliamentary Party.Her son, Rahul Gandhi — also a former Congress president — is the current Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha, where he represents Uttar Pradesh’s Raebareli constituency, a seat she held from 2004 to 2024 before moving to the Rajya Sabha.Her daughter, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, is a Congress general secretary and the MP from Kerala’s Wayanad seat.","PM Narendra Modi extended greetings to former Congress president Sonia Gandhi on her 79th birthday.

NEW DELHI: Banking regulator RBI and the country's largest PSU bank SBI Monday told Supreme Court it was not possible to give personal hearings to account holders before declaring an account fraud in view of the massive number of banking frauds.The country witnessed 60,000 cases of bank fraud in the last two financial years involving Rs 48,244 crore, the financial institutions said.Responding to query of a bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and K V Viswanathan on why personal hearings cannot be given before declaring an account fraud which is part of natural justice, solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for SBI, said the number of bank frauds had been alarming in recent years and any personal or oral hearing would derail the entire process of declaring an account fraud.He said the number of bank frauds was 23,953 in FY 2024-25 and 36,060 in FY 2023-24. The amount involved was Rs 36,014 crore in 2024-25, which was a 194% jump from Rs 12,230 crore in the previous year. Mehta said no bank gives personal hearings as it may defeat the very purpose of declaring the account to be a fraud. He argued that banks may have to encounter situations by which it would not be possible to afford oral hearing or personal hearing to the parties concerned.RBI also told the bench it had not issued any circular for making personal hearings mandatory in declaring an account fraud. The lawyer appearing for RBI said operationally it would not be feasible to do so, and if it is made mandatory, then bankers would have to spend more time on granting personal hearings than doing banking operations. He said RBI left it to the wisdom of banks to take a call, and everything cannot be micromanaged by the regulator. The bench, however, said there may be situations where personal hearing should be given for which there are no guidelines.In 2023, SC held that the principles of natural justice demand that borrowers must be served a notice and given an opportunity to explain the conclusions of the forensic audit report before their account is classified as fraud under the Master Directions on Frauds. In addition, the decision classifying the borrower's account as fraudulent must be made by a reasoned order. After the verdict, the controversy arose whether personal hearings needed to be given or written response filed by account holder was enough before declaring an fraudulent account.","The country witnessed 60,000 cases of bank fraud in the last two financial years involving Rs 48,244 crore.

SC had began its journey as a protector of environment in a petition filed by retired forest officer T N Godavarman Thirumalpad in 1995 seeking protection of the Nilgiri forests from illegal felling of trees, and in the span of three decades, it has protected northeastern forests, Kashmir Khair trees, Aravalli hills, Western Ghats, Saranda forest, sanctuaries and stopped illegal stone quarries and mining.On Monday, the case related to the protection of Sukhna Lake in Chandigarh triggered the rethink on the part of SC. A bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi castigated the Haryana and Punjab govts for being in collusion with real estate agents to allow rapid urbanisation around the water body to throttle its catchment area.However, it said Punjab and Haryana HC, which is just 500 metres from the lake, would be better placed to gauge the local situation and pass appropriate orders. It asked amicus curiae and senior advocate K Parameshwar, additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati, and representative of the Central Empowered Committee (CEC) to identify localised issues raised in a large number of petitions pending before the green bench.The cases involving local issues should be dealt with by HCs concerned, the bench said, adding, ""We cannot sit here in Delhi and usurp the jurisdiction and wisdom of HCs, which are in a better position to handle the issues raised.Moreover, local environmentalists may not always be able to travel to Delhi to present the views of the local population. HCs would be in a much better position to consider views of local people. ""Petitioner Thirumalpad passed away on June 1, 2016, at the age of 86. In his 1995 petition, he had moved SC being distressed by the systematic destruction of pristine forests in Gudalur in the Nilgiris, Tamil Nadu. On Dec 12, 1996, a bench led by then CJI J S Verma passed an interim order stopping felling of trees and all non-forest activities across the country.Senior advocate Harish Salve was appointed amicus curiae. SC, thereafter, banned movement of timber from northeast, and several orders followed as the top court kept an eagle eye on forests through continuous mandamus.","SC had began its journey as a protector of environment in a petition filed by retired forest officer T N Godavarman Thirumalpad in 1995.

Not about AI, but

fabrication of case laws

: Senior advocate

NEW DELHI: In the first instance of misuse of artificial intelligence in the judicial process - detected in Supreme Court - a litigant took the help of AI tools to draft a response that contained hundreds of fake cases. Taking cognisance of the matter, SC said it could not brush it aside but would hear the case on merit.Appearing before a bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and A G Masih, senior advocate Neeraj Kishan Kaul said a rejoinder filed in the court cited many cases which are all fake and not part of any judicial record. He alleged that some of these cases were correctly mentioned but the questions of law, which were decided in these cases, were misreported. Senior advocate C A Sundaram, appearing for Gstaad Hotels Bengaluru promoter Deepak Raheja, admitted it was a mistake, saying, ""I have never been more embarrassed. ""Sundaram read out an affidavit filed by the filing advocate in the case.Senior advocate Neeraj Kishan Kaul, appearing for Omkara Asset Reconstruction, said the rejoinder submitted by Gstaad Hotels Bengaluru promoter Deepak Raheja was prepared using AI tools and fabricated cases were cited to convince the court in his favour.Kaul submitted that the erring party was not entitled to be heard after the grave mistake. ""Fake case laws were invented using AI tools and questions of laws, which were decided by the court, were fabricated by using AI. It is not about AI, but fabrication of case laws and concoction of points of law,"" he said. It would be difficult for a bench to detect falsehood as it is supposed to hear 70-80 cases, and if the court relies on the AI-generated falsehood, then it would be disastrous for the judicial system, he added.Sundaram said that he was in complete agreement with Kaul on this issue and told the bench that it was a terrible error committed in court.Reading out the affidavit - filed by the advocate-on-record (AoR), who is responsible for filing any document in SC - Sundaram said the lawyer tendered unconditional apology and assured SC that he would be cautious in future not to repeat the mistake. He sought permission to withdraw the response. ""We cannot simply brush it aside,"" the court said, and asked why the AoR should take the blame as the response said very clearly that the affidavit was drafted under the guidance of the litigant. SC, thereafter, went ahead hearing the case on merit.The controversy revolves around a high-profile case between Omkara Assets Reconstruction Private Limited and Gstaad Hotels Private Limited.

Indigo crisis enters seventh day





NEW DELHI: The aviation minister K Rammohan Naidu vowed in Rajya Sabha on Monday that the government will take “very, very strict action” against Indigo over the recent fiasco to ""set an example"" across the industry.Speaking during question hour, Naidu said the disruption was a result of IndiGo’s internal lapses. Blaming the carrier for failing to manage its crew and duty roster, the minister said, “We are not taking this situation easily. We are doing an inquiry. We will take very, very strict action not only for this situation but also as an example.""Responding to a query from Congress MP Pramod Tiwari, who sought to know whether the cancellations stemmed from a malfunction in the automatic message switching system (AMSS) - the glitch that hit flight operations in early November 2025 - Naidu clarified that the two incidents were unrelated. The IndiGo crisis, he said, arose from “anomalies and mismanagement” in the airline’s crew roster system.The minister also outlined the timeline of the revised flight duty time limitations (FDTL), introduced after a high court order in April 2025. Of the 22 guidelines, 15 were implemented on July 1 and the remaining seven on November 1. He stressed that multiple consultations were held with all stakeholders, including IndiGo, and that the rules had to be followed “without any compromise on safety.”Naidu said the directorate general of civil aviation has been in continuous discussions with airlines since FDTL came fully into force, and had granted limited exemptions based on operational variations and safety assessments.Noting that the crisis erupted “almost one whole month” after the final phase of FDTL implementation, he pointed out that IndiGo did not flag any imminent issues during a meeting with the ministry on December 1.“This is a day-to-day operation - something that Indigo should have maintained. Indigo was supposed to manage the crew, roaster through its day-to-day operations,” he said.Reiterating that accountability is non-negotiable, Naidu added: “If there is any mis-compliance, non-compliance, non-adherence for any single person, entity and organisation, or any operator functioning in this civil aviation, we will take very, very strict action so that we set an example in the industry.”Indigo’s operational crisis entered into its seventh consecutive day of chaos on Monday. With more 500-large scale flight cancellations continuing across major airports.According to the civil aviation ministry, IndiGo is scheduled to operate 1,802 flights across 137 of its 138 destinations on Monday. The ministry also said the airline has already returned around 4,500 misplaced bags to passengers and aims to deliver the remaining 4,500 within the next 36 hours.Separately, the Supreme Court refused to entertain a petition seeking judicial intervention over the large-scale flight cancellations, noting that the matter did not warrant its involvement at this stage.(With inputs from agencies)","The aviation minister K Rammohan Naidu vowed in Rajya Sabha on Monday that the government will take “very, very strict action” against Indigo.

NEW DELHI: The ministry of external affairs on Monday issued a strong-worded message asked China to issue assurance to India after the recent harassment of an Arunachal Pradesh woman at Shanghai airport.The statement follows growing concerns over arbitrary checks and mistreatment of Indian passengers in transit, after reports emerged of an Arunachal Pradesh woman being harassed at Shanghai airport.Responding to the matter, ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, ""We expect the Chinese authorities to provide assurances that Indian citizens transiting through Chinese airports will not be selectively targeted, arbitrarily detained or harassed and that regulations governing international air travel would be respected by the Chinese side.""""We have stated many times that Arunachal Pradesh is and will remain an integral part of India, and we do not want any interference in it,"" Jaiswal added.On the China-India relationship, Jaiswal said, ""...This relationship is gradually moving in a positive direction, and we want to keep it moving in that direction.""The MEA also issued an advisory urging Indian nationals to be cautious. ""MEA would advise Indian nationals to exercise due discretion while travelling to China or transiting through the country,"" Jaiswal stated.Ministry of external affairs last month after the incident strongly protested China’s “arbitrary detention” of an Indian passport holder from Arunachal Pradesh at Shanghai Pudong International Airport, stating that no amount of political denial will alter the fact that the northeastern state is an “integral and inalienable” part of India.The ministry of external affairs said it issued a strong demarche to Beijing and its embassy in New Delhi after the woman, identified as Prema Wangjom Thongdok, was detained during transit despite being eligible for visa-free passage under Chinese regulations.“We want to say that Arunachal Pradesh is an integral and inalienable part of India, and this is a fact that is self-evident. No amount of denial by the Chinese side is going to change this indisputable reality,” MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said during a weekly briefing.According to the MEA, the Indian national, holding a valid passport, was travelling onward to Japan when she was stopped at Shanghai airport. India said the detention lacked legal basis and breached norms of international travel.“This issue has been taken up strongly with the Chinese side. Chinese authorities have still not been able to explain their actions, which are in violation of several conventions governing international air travel,” Jaiswal said. He added that China’s actions contradicted its own policy for visa-free transit.The MEA warned that such incidents undermine diplomatic engagement between the two countries. “Arbitrary actions by China involving an Indian citizen from Arunachal Pradesh are most unhelpful towards efforts being made by both sides to build mutual trust and understanding and gradually move towards normalisation of bilateral relations,” Jaiswal noted.However, China has rejected India’s accusations. Responding to Beijing-based media, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said that “the lawful rights and interests of the person concerned were fully protected and no compulsory measures were taken on her,” dismissing claims of detention or harassment.This response came despite the Indian citizen narrating her “long ordeal”, alleging that Chinese immigration officials “mocked and raised questions” about her Indian identity, with the situation resolved only after intervention by Indian missions in Shanghai and Beijing.",The statement follows growing concerns over arbitrary checks and mistreatment of Indian passengers in transit.

It is an important element of our comprehensive global strategic partnership with the United States,” he said.He noted that the two countries strongly condemned the recent terrorist attacks in Pahalgam and Delhi, and reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening multilateral cooperation against terrorism through platforms such as the UN, the Quad, the Financial Action Task Force, and other forums.""The two sides renewed their commitment to strengthening multilateral cooperation in the fields of terrorism, including at the UN, within the format of Quad, as well as in the format of Financial Action Task Force and several other multilateral forums where we discuss and continue to discuss these aspects,"" Jaiswal added.At the meeting, India and the United States pressed for tougher UN actions against Pakistan-based terror groups, seeking additional punitive measures such as asset freezes and arms embargoes on Lashkar-e-Taiba , Jaish-e-Mohammad, their proxy outfits, and their backers.They also called for further designations of ISIS and al-Qaida affiliates under the UN sanctions regime. Although these groups are already listed and subject to existing restrictions, both sides stressed the need to broaden and intensify global pressure on them.During the talks, India thanked the US State Department for designating The Resistance Front (TRF), a Lashkar-e-Taiba proxy, as both a Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO) and a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT). The designation followed the group’s claim of responsibility for the Pahalgam terror attack ""The two sides called for additional designations of ISIS and al-Qa'ida affiliates, and LeT and JeM and their proxy groups, supporters, sponsors, financiers and backers, under the UN 1267 sanctions regime, ensuring their members face a global asset freeze, travel ban and arms embargo,"" the statement by MEA read.","The ministry of external affairs on Monday took a swipe at Pakistan, saying India is closely tracking developments in the neighbouring country. “democracy and Pakistan don’t go together,” as concerns deepen over the country’s weakening democratic institutions.

'Will Set An Example': IndiGo Faces Heat As Aviation Minister Promises Tough Action In Rajya Sabha

IndiGo outlines ‘preliminary factors’ behind disruption



NEW DELHI: IndiGo on Monday replied to the DGCA’s show-cause notice, saying it is “realistically not possible to pinpoint the exact cause(s)” immediately due to the complexity and scale of its operations. The response addressed the recent large-scale operational disruptions and flight cancellations across the airline’s network.The reply by the airline’s chief executive officer and chief operating officer, was submitted, with the airline requesting additional time to complete a comprehensive Root Cause Analysis (RCA).""The airline notes that the DGCA’s manual allows a fifteen-day response timeline for show-cause notices, suggesting more time is needed to conduct a comprehensive Root Cause Analysis (RCA). The complete RCA will be shared once finished,"" the statement read.In its submission, IndiGo expressed that it is “profusely apologetic” and deeply regrets the inconvenience caused to passengers. The airline attributed the disruptions to the “compounding effect of multiple factors,” which coincided in an “unfortunate and unforeseeable confluence.”The DGCA had earlier granted a one-time 24-hour extension to IndiGo respond to its showcause notice, setting the new deadline at 6 pm on Monday.The regulator warned that failure to meet the deadline would lead to the matter being decided ex-parte.The notice cited “significant lapses in planning, oversight and resource management” as the primary reasons behind the airline’s large-scale operational failure.Preliminary factors cited by IndiGo included minor technical glitches, schedule changes linked to the winter season, adverse weather conditions, increased congestion in the aviation system, and challenges arising from the implementation of updated crew-rostering rules (Flight Duty Time Limitation Phase II). The airline added that it had been engaging with the DGCA regarding difficulties in implementing FDTL Phase II and had sought variations, exemptions, or extensions.IndiGo said the disruptions began in early December when these factors collectively affected crew availability and on-time network performance. To manage the situation, the airline carried out a network ""reboot” on 5 December, involving a large number of cancellations to recover stranded passengers, ease airport congestion, and reposition crew and aircraft. Services began normalizing from 6 December onwards.The airline also stated that it provided timely notifications and assistance to passengers, including meals, refreshments, hotels, and local transport, in line with DGCA requirements. Substantial refunds have reportedly been processed for most affected customers.The DGCA is currently examining IndiGo’s response and said that enforcement action, if deemed necessary, will be taken in due course.The current disruption is linked to the implementation of revised Flight Duty Time Limitation (FDTL) rules for pilots, which impose longer weekly rest periods, stricter night duty limits, and reduced night landings.Initially opposed by domestic carriers including IndiGo and Air India, the rules were phased in during July and November following Delhi High Court directions. IndiGo has obtained temporary relaxations for the second phase of the norms until February 10.IndiGo’s operational crisis entered its seventh day on Monday, with over 500 flights cancelled across major airports, leaving thousands of passengers stranded across the country.",IndiGo on Monday replied to the DGCA’s show-cause notice.

NEW DELHI: Lok Sabha member Supriya Sule has introduced a private member's Bill in the Lower House to promote work-life balance for workers and employees in India.The Bill, ""The Right to Disconnect Bill, 2025"", seeks to impose sanctions at a rate of 1 per cent of the total remuneration of its employees on entities (companies or societies) for any non-compliance with the provisions of the Bill.The Bill, as introduced in the Lok Sabha on Friday, provides every employee the right to disconnect from work-related electronic communications.""It aims to foster a better quality of life and a healthier work-life balance by reducing the ""burnout caused by today's digital culture,"" she wrote on X.While digital and communication technology offer benefits in terms of work flexibility, it also carries a significant risk of eroding the boundaries between professional and personal life, she argued in the private member's Bill.""Studies have found that if an employee is expected to be available round the clock, they tend to exhibit risks of over-work like sleep deprivation, developing stress and being emotionally exhausted. This persistent urge to respond to calls and emails (termed as 'telepressure'), constant checking of emails throughout the day, and even on weekends and holidays, is reported to have destroyed the work-life balance of employees,"" the statement of objects and reasons of the Bill read.""According to a study, the constant monitoring of work related messages and emails, may overtax employees' brains leading to a condition called 'info-obesity'.""The Bill argued that there is a need to respect the personal space of the employees by recognising their right to disconnect and not respond to their employer's calls, emails etc., during out-of-work hours.""The need is also to recognise the rights of the employees, it also takes into consideration the competitive needs of the companies and their diverse work cultures. Flexibility in the right to disconnect rules and leaves it to the individual companies to negotiate terms of service with their employees is need of the hour,"" the Bill further read.The digital transformation has direct impact on conditions in the employment contract, like the time and the place of work.Hence if an employee agrees to works during out-of-work hours, overtime pay at the same rate as his wage rate is also necessary to check the surge in unpaid overtime work, brought about by digital transformation, she argued in the Bill.The Bill also provides for counselling services to increase awareness among employees and citizens, on reasonable use of digital and communication tools, for professional and personal use.To free an employee from digital distractions and enable him to truly connect with the people around him, the Bill provides for digital detox centres.""The Bill thus champions for the rights and welfare of employees, by mandating individual entities to negotiate out-of-hour service conditions with their employees, and upholding the right of employee to disconnect. The Bill seeks to recognise right to disconnect as a way to reduce stress and ease tension between an employees' personal and professional life,"" the Bill concluded.She introduced all together what she termed forward-looking Private Member Bills in the Parliament - the other two were The Paternity and Paternal Benefits Bill, 2025. It introduces paid paternal leave to ensure fathers have the legal right to take part in their child's early development. It breaks the traditional model, supports the new mother's well-being, and promotes flexible parenting.The other one is the Code on Social Security (Amendment) Bill, 2025, that recognises platform-based gig workers as a distinct category, ensuring minimum wages, regulated hours, social security, fair conditions, and equitable contracts to ensure a fairer, more sustainable environment and economy for them.Several other members of the Lok Sabha also introduced their Private Member Bills in the House.","Lok Sabha member Supriya Sule has introduced a private member's Bill to promote work-life balance for workers and employees in India.

Current situation:

NEW DELHI: Under fire for its handling of the IndiGo crisis, govt said on Monday it would set an ""example"" for other airlines with ""very, very strict action"" against the budget carrier once the probe into the massive flight disruptions is complete. The unprecedented disruption was caused by an ""internal crisis"" in the airline, Union aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu said in the Rajya Sabha Monday.Also, with the duopoly situation - Air India Group and IndiGo - being blamed for making the bad situation even worse, Naidu said India needs more airlines. ""We have envisioned the demand to be growing at such a rate that we want to have more airlines in the picture... India today has the capacity of five big airlines. We are talking about two airlines, but the capacity, the demand that India is creating, we need to have five big airlines,"" he said, adding that this was ""the time to start an airline in India"". Naidu said govt wants ""more pillars"" in the industry to counter concentration and build resilience. ""There is so much growth that is happening. So let us all encourage more airlines to come into this industry along with govt,"" he said.""We are not taking this situation easily. We are conducting an inquiry... Revised flight duty time limitation (FDTL) was introduced after an April 2025 HC order. Of the 22 guidelines, 15 were implemented on July 1 and remaining seven on Nov 1. Multiple consultations were held with all stakeholders, including IndiGo, and rules had to be followed without any compromise on safety,"" Naidu said.The DGCA ""has been in continuous discussions with airlines since FDTL came fully into force, and had granted limited exemptions based on operational variations and safety assessments"", he said. The crisis erupted ""almost one whole month"" after the Nov 1 implementation and IndiGo did not flag any imminent issues during a meeting with the ministry on Dec 1. ""This is a day-to-day operation, something that IndiGo should have maintained. .. We care for pilots, crew and passengers. We made it clear to all the airlines. IndiGo was supposed to manage the crew and roster. Passengers faced a lot of difficulties. We are not taking the situation lightly.""IndiGo is fast returning to near normal, with the airline saying it expected to operate over 1,800 flights on Monday. ""We have optimised our operations and managed to reduce the number of cancellations which are being notified to customers in advance. Our on-time performance has improved to 91% across the network.""Rs 827 crore already refunded, and the rest is under process for cancellations up to Dec 15, 2025. Over 4,500 bags have been delivered to respective customers, and we are on track to deliver the rest in the next 36 hours,"" IndiGo said.The Union aviation ministry said about 5.9 lakh PNRs for travel between Dec 1 and 7 have been cancelled and refunds of about Rs 570 crore have been issued.","The disruption was caused by an ""internal crisis"" in the airline, Union aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu said in the Rajya Sabha.

DGCA may scale down IndiGo ops to make room for others

Also read:

NEW DELHI: IndiGo may have its schedule cut by 5% and the same - roughly about 110 daily flights - could be given to other airlines that have the resources to add capacity. A livid government is mulling incremental cuts to the schedule starting with 5%, followed by another 5% in coming days if need be, say sources, adding that other actions are also being considered in the wake of the severe disruptions caused by flight cancellations.Meanwhile, a ""profusely apologetic"" IndiGo has in its reply to the DGCA's show-cause notice blamed a combination of five factors, including new flight duty time limitation (FDTL) rules and winter schedule-related changes, for its massive flight disruptions.The airline said given the scale of its operations, it is ""realistically not possible to pinpoint the exact cause(s)"" in the time given. It sought more time for a ""comprehensive root-cause analysis"", citing DGCA's manual that allows a 15-day response time.DGCA is in the process of examining the response and enforcement action as deemed appropriate will be taken in due course,"" the aviation ministry said regarding the responses submitted at 6.01pm Monday by CEO Pieter Elbers and COO Isidre Porqueras, who is also the accountable manager.Given the public anger at aviation authorities, it remains to be seen whether IndiGo will be granted more time. The DGCA could now scale down IndiGo's flights in proportion to its crew strength and make the slots available to other airlines depending on their resource availability.Apart from a hefty financial penalty, the top executives, who are approved by the DGCA, including the airline's accountable manager (the COO), may face action. The airline, too, may either seek resignations or sack key people seen as responsible for the huge mess.The airline has attributed the disruption to the ""compounding effect of multiple factors which coincided in lesser or greater measure"" in an ""unfortunate and unforeseeable confluence"". It listed these as minor technical glitches; schedule changes linked to the start of the winter season; adverse weather conditions; increased congestion in the aviation system; and implementation of and operation under the updated crew rostering rules (FDTL phase II) that came into force on Nov 1, 2025.""IndiGo notes they had been engaging with the DGCA regarding challenges in implementing FDTL phase II and were seeking variations, exemptions or extensions. The disruptions began in early Dec when the compounding factors resulted in a lower on-time network performance, which affected crew availability,"" the aviation ministry said.IndiGo termed the Dec 5 large-scale cancellations, when over 1,000 IndiGo flights - almost half its daily schedule - were affected, as a ""drastic measure"" of ""rebooting"" the network ""to recover stranded customers, ease airport congestion, and reposition crew/aircraft"".Meanwhile, the four-member DGCA panel probing IndiGo disruption, headed by joint DG Sanjay Brahamane, could summon CEO Pieter Elbers and COO Isidre Porqueras. This panel has been mandated to pinpoint the root cause of this disruption and will examine manpower planning, rostering and IndiGo's preparedness to implement the new FDTL rules.","IndiGo may have its schedule cut by 5% and the same - roughly about 110 daily flights - could be given to other airlines that have the resources to add capacity.

NEW DELHI: Accusing Congress of portraying ' Vande Mataram ' as ""communalist"" on account of its own appeasement politics - which made it see the national song through the lens of MA Jinnah - defence minister Rajnath Singh on Monday urged parliamentarians across party lines to restore its glory by adding a new fundamental duty in the Constitution that mandates according the same respect to 'Vande Mataram' as is given to the national anthem ""My request to all members is that we all come together and consider whether we can add a new fundamental duty under Article 51A of the Constitution - that all citizens shall accord the same respect to 'Vande Mataram' as we accord to the national anthem. If we do this, it will be a perfect tribute to 'Vande Mataram', its author, and Bengal's great nationalist thinker Bankim Chandra Chatterjee,"" Singh said while participating in a discussion in Lok Sabha on the 150th anniversary of the national song.Singh said that after Independence, it was decided that the national anthem and the national song would be given equal status, but only the national anthem ' Jana Gana Mana ' became an integral part of the country's consciousness, while the national song 'Vande Mataram' was treated like an ""extra"".""On the very soil where 'Vande Mataram' was composed, the Congress took the decision to truncate the song in 1937. Every generation must know about the political deceit and injustice done to 'Vande Mataram'.This injustice was not only to a song but to the people of independent India and the freedom fighters who fought for freedom with chants of 'Vande Mataram',"" he said.'Vande Mataram' is complete in itself, yet attempts were made to make it incomplete. ""However, it has remained the immortal song of our nation, and it will remain so,"" he added.Singh emphasised that future generations must understand the mentality of those who undermined the song, calling it an injustice to India's cultural and national identity.Earlier, LS Speaker Om Birla described 'Vande Mataram' as a reflection of India's harmony and strength. In his opening remarks, Birla said that as the country commemorates the 150-year glorious journey of 'Vande Mataram', it remains etched in the heart of every Indian even today.Former Union minister and BJP MP Anurag Thakur said, ""Vande Mataram' is not just a song; it is a 'Maha Mantra'.

It recorded that ""three examinations - UGC-NET, CSIR-NET and NEET-PG - had to be postponed, one examination viz. NEET-UG saw instances of paper leaks, and one examination CUET (UG/PG) saw its results postponed"".The committee also flagged that in JEE (Main) 2025 held in Jan, at least 12 questions had to be withdrawn due to errors in the final answer key. It observed that ""such instances do not inspire confidence of the examinees in the system"". ""The committee, therefore, recommends that NTA needs to quickly get their act together so that such instances, which otherwise are fully avoidable, do not occur in future,"" the report said.On exam security, the panel weighed risks in both online and offline modes. It noted that pen-and-paper exams ""offer more opportunities for paper leaks"", while computer-based tests (CBT) ""can be hacked in a manner that is difficult to detect"". Between the two, it supported a stronger shift to traditional formats, stating that NTA should closely study and replicate the CBSE and UPSC models. For CBT, the panel recommended that such exams be hosted only in government-controlled centres and ""never in private centres"".The report also flagged concerns over the continuing engagement of tainted vendors. It said several firms involved in paper setting, administration and correction have been blacklisted by organisations and state governments, yet continue to secure contracts elsewhere. ""Such blacklisted firms must not be engaged for any entrance test by the NTA or state govts,"" it said, recommending a nationwide list of blacklisted firms and associated individuals to prevent future contracts.Highlighting NTA's finances, the panel noted that the agency ""collected an estimated Rs 3,512.9 crore while it has spent Rs 3,064.7 crore on the conduct of exams, thereby creating a surplus of Rs 448 crores in the last six years"". It recommended that this corpus be used to build NTA's internal capability or to strengthen regulatory and monitoring systems for vendors.The panel also flagged growing dependence on private coaching, urging tighter alignment of entrance examinations with school curricula and recommending a task force to explore regulatory oversight of coaching sector.","The parliamentary standing committee on education has said National Testing Agency's handling of entrance examinations in 2024 ""has not inspired much confidence"" The committee, headed by Congress MP Digvijaya Singh, noted in its report that ""in 2024 alone, of the 14 competitive examinations conducted by NTA, at least five faced major issues""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125846244,imgsize-563455,width-400,resizemode-4/critical-of-nta-panel-says-return-to-pen-paper-tests.jpg"

The plea of default bail is untenable since no substantial change in circumstances has occurred subsequent to the rejection of their earlier bail applications,” judge Manjeet Singh Manhas said in his order.Earlier, on Oct 4, the court had rejected bail applications of all accused.In their fresh bail applications, the policemen argued that the chargesheet was filed on Oct 22, 2025, and the most serious charges like attempt to murder had been dropped against them.The CBI counsel contended that the chargesheet still contained substantive offences.The case is based on an FIR registered by the CBI on July 26, 2025, following directions from the Supreme Court of India in a 2023 special leave petition.As per case details, constable Khursheed Ahmed Chowhan was detained at an interrogation centre and tortured from Feb 20 to Feb. 26, 2023.

‘Girls Should Not Be Allowed To Go Outside At Night’: Mamata Banerjee’s Shocker On Durgapur Gangrape

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday continued its stay on the Allahabad high court's controversial observation that acts such as grabbing a woman’s breast, breaking her pyjama string and dragging her under a culvert were insufficient to attract charges of rape or attempt to rape under the IPC.A bench headed by Chief Justice Surya Kant directed that the accused in the case will stand trial under the charges of rape and attempt to rape under the IPC and the POCSO Act, rather than lesser offences, news agency PTI reported.The bench said it would not comment on the merits of the ongoing trial, and the accused would remain free to challenge the charges through due process.Calling attention to a pattern of “unfortunate observations” made by various High Courts while dealing with sexual assault matters, the Supreme Court said it was inclined to frame comprehensive guidelines on the degree of sensitivity required in judicial language and reasoning.“Sometimes these observations go unnoticed, and sometimes victims and their families are forced into compromise because of them,” the bench noted.The case originated as a suo motu matter, after the court earlier stayed the high court's remarks that the acts amounted only to aggravated sexual assault, not attempt to rape.The SC also acknowledged a separate appeal challenging the high court ruling, tagging it with the suo motu proceedings.The court asked amicus curiae and senior advocate Shobha Gupta to submit examples of similar remarks made by courts across the country, to aid the formulation of guidelines.",The Supreme Court on Monday continued its stay on the Allahabad high court's controversial observation.

NEW DELHI: Union labour minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Monday defended the four Labour Codes in the Lok Sabha, citing their impact on women workers, particularly in Assam’s tea plantations, amid opposition's criticism that the reforms dilute labour protections. His remarks came in response to questions on implementation and safeguards under the Codes.Responding to a question on women workers in tea gardens, Mandaviya said: “Whether it is a tea garden or any factory or establishment anywhere in the country, the Labour Codes have made strong provisions for the dignity, safety, health, and rights of women workers.” He said equal wages for men and women for the same work had been guaranteed, health facilities ensured and maternity benefits strengthened through provisions such as crèche facilities and paid leave.Referring to social security cover, the minister told the House that under Ayushman Bharat and ESIC, women workers and their families are entitled to cashless treatment, including for illnesses linked to hazardous work. He added that wherever 50 or more women workers are employed, housing, drinking water and sanitation facilities have been made mandatory. “In every establishment, an Internal Complaints Committee or grievance redressal committee is mandatory, and it is compulsory to include women members in it,” he said.Mandaviya noted that women constitute 70–80% of the tea garden workforce and said over 12 lakh plantation workers were benefiting from the Codes. He questioned the Opposition’s resistance, asking whether it objected to equal wages, maternity benefits and health security for women.Opposition parties, including Congress and Trinamool, have argued that the Codes favour employers through longer work hours and weaker enforcement. The government maintains that the reforms modernise labour laws and expand social security coverage. After the debate, Mandaviya reiterated his position on social media, listing equal pay, health security, maternity benefits, safe workplaces and mandatory grievance committees as core safeguards for women workers.","Union labour minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Monday defended the four Labour Codes in the Lok Sabha.

Paramount vs Netflix: What’s at stake in Hollywood

Market reaction

NEW DELHI: Paramount has launched a $108 billion hostile bid to acquire Warner Bros Discovery (WBD), directly appealing to shareholders just days after WBD agreed to be acquired by Netflix. The move sets up a rare, high-stakes media battle that could reshape global entertainment.The offer, announced late Monday, comes from Paramount and its CEO David Ellison , who told CNBC the bid aims “to finish what we started.” The all-cash offer of $30 per share is pitched as a more secure alternative to Netflix’s $27.75-per-share proposal made last week.Paramount argues its bid “provides shareholders $18 billion more in cash than the Netflix consideration” and offers “a quicker path to completion,” according to an official statement.Netflix agreed on Friday to buy WBD’s studios and HBO Max after the entertainment giant splits into two companies. Paramount accused Warner of failing to “meaningfully engage” despite submitting six takeover proposals in 12 weeks. The company signalled it is prepared for a prolonged tender battle, despite having a much smaller market value of around $14 billion, compared to Netflix’s $400+ billion.Also read: Warner Bros-Netflix deal - Is the Tudum effect harmful for Indian cinema? 'The risk is two-fold' The Paramount bid is backed by the Ellison family, RedBird Capital, and $54 billion in debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo.Paramount warned WBD shareholders that Netflix’s takeover is unlikely to clear global regulators. Netflix, however, has included a $5.8 billion breakup fee in its terms, signalling confidence. Co-CEO Ted Sarandos said he is “highly confident” the deal will be approved.US President Donald Trump weighed in, telling reporters the Netflix deal “could be a problem” due to market dominance and adding, “I’ll be involved in that decision.”If Warner backs out of the Netflix deal to accept another offer, it must pay $2.8 billion to Netflix.Whoever wins will control some of the most valuable franchises in entertainment, including HBO, Harry Potter, DC Comics, and CNN. If Netflix succeeds, analysts say it will cement the company’s control over Hollywood content and accelerate disruptions to theatres and artificial intelligence-driven filmmaking.If Paramount prevails, Warner would become part of a media empire led by Ellison and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, who are also positioned to take control of TikTok’s U.S. operations under a deal championed by Trump.Warner shares closed at $26.08, below Netflix’s offer price, signalling investor doubt the deal will close.

Your Money Vanished? The Truth About Online Scams & How To Fight Back!

MUMBAI: Mumbai is seeing a surge in cyber financial fraud, with nearly 20,000 cases reported since 2020 and losses crossing Rs 2,000 crore, yet recoveries remain minimal.Victims, from businesswomen to retirees, are finding themselves trapped not only by sophisticated scammers who clone cards and steal data, but also by banks that routinely refuse reimbursement despite RBI's zero-liability rules.Experts say the financial system's own vulnerabilities are to blame. Instead of protecting customers, banks often shift the burden onto them, leaving countless citizens fighting legal notices, recovery calls and bureaucratic indifference long after the fraud occurs.Of the cases, 4,132 FIRs were for credit or debit card fraud, ATM fraud, SIM swap, cloning, activation and OTP sharing, with victims losing Rs 161.5 crore and the police recovering just Rs 4.8 crore.The cases spanned various methods of fraud. In one example, Sakinaka resident Romaljit Kaur Makkar, a businesswoman, lost Rs 2.5 lakh after her credit card was cloned. On April 3, while attending a meeting in a Mumbai office with her card in her possession, fraudulent transactions were carried out on a merchant machine in Lucknow.Makkar alleged that her PIN could have been captured by CCTV during a shopping trip earlier that day.In another instance, retired engineer Navneet Batra (64) of Borivli East has faced daily calls from recovery agents and legal notices since March 2023 over four fraudulent fund transfers totalling Rs 1.9 lakh.He alleged that scamsters stole his card details to buy herbal products from Bihar. Despite filing a complaint with Dahisar police and blocking his card, the bank has not reversed the transactions.RBI rules on card fraud stipulate that customers have zero liability if they report a fraud within three days. If reported within four to seven days, liability is limited to Rs 10,000-25,000 depending on card limit.In cases of customer negligence, such as sharing PINs or OTPs, the customer bears full loss until the unauthorised transaction is reported; the bank covers subsequent losses. Banks must reverse charges within ten working days and resolve outstanding complaints within 90 days.Maharashtra Cyber Cell's Yashasvi Yadav said fraudsters steal card data through leaks and ATM skimmers. Expert Ritesh Bhatia argued that blaming victims for sharing OTPs is misplaced, as such fraud usually stems from systemic failures like data leaks and weak verification, making banks - customers - responsible for securing the ecosystem.Former police chief D Sivanandhan said banks are liable unless victims deliberately share sensitive details. Cyber lawyer Dr Prashant Mali said banks routinely ignore RBI's zero-liability rules and called for stricter KYC, faster card blocking, better coordination and penalties for banks that fail security norms.","Mumbai is seeing a surge in cyber financial fraud, with nearly 20,000 cases reported since 2020.

Dhakne also said if the city's AQI crosses 300 for consecutive three days, then all polluting units within a 2km radius such as construction and redevelopment (demolition) sites, RMC plants and bakeries will be stopped until the AQI improves. ""Govt works cannot be exempt. The same strict rules must apply across the board,"" he said, adding that while Mumbai currently has 28 air quality monitoring stations, the BMC is open to adding more if data gaps appear.We should also be able to start getting localised AQI data from the air quality sensors that construction sites have been asked to put up. So far, around 500 construction sites have installed the specified air quality sensors linked to the BMC's central dashboard. This network will help pinpoint hyperlocal pollution hotspots and guide targeted interventions,"" he said, adding that a meeting with the transport and traffic department was also in the pipeline in the coming days to crackdown specifically on vehicles carrying uncovered debris, construction materials or causing spillage on the road.Dhakne, who earlier served as member secretary of the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB), said Mumbai's priority must be to increase the number of days the city's air quality remains in the ‘satisfactory' category. ""In a dense coastal city like Mumbai, pushing AQI below 50 is extremely challenging, but improving the overall number of satisfactory days is achievable,"" he said. Data shows in 2025, Mumbai saw 55 good AQI days, 161 satisfactory, 112 moderate and one poor AQI day. Enforcement has already intensified: In Dec alone, the civic body issued 191 show-cause notices and 78 stop-work notices to errant construction sites.Meanwhile, on Monday at a meeting with the garden department, the BMC proposed setting up bamboo nurseries in the city. As bamboo is classified as grass, it can be cut without permission, allowing quick deployment for green buffers wherever needed.","At present, construction sites are fined just Rs 10,000 for violations.

Where Metaverse budget cuts may go

Meta reportedly delays MR glasses

The day Facebook changed its name to Meta





Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg seems to have finally realised that one of the company's biggest bets—Metaverse—is not working (or not working as expected). It is also the technology that the company changed its very name after. In 2021, after 17 years of being called Facebook, the social networking parent company behind Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus changed its name to Meta. Now according to a report from Bloomberg, Meta is likely to slash its Reality Labs budget, shaving off as much as 30%. The proposed metaverse cuts are reportedly part of the company's annual budget planning for 2026, which included a series of meetings at Zuckerberg's compound in Hawaii last month.For those unaware, Metaverse unit works on virtual reality headsets and a VR-based social network, which produces the company's Quest mixed-reality headsets, smart glasses made with EssilorLuxottica's Ray-Ban and upcoming augmented-reality glasses. Meta has struggled to sell its vision of an immersive metaverse of interconnected virtual worlds and expand the market for its devices beyond the niche of the gaming community.Analysts see the move reflecting the overall lack of interest in products like Meta’s social virtual reality platform Horizon Worlds, as well as its virtual reality hardware—both in the industry at large, as well as among consumers.Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s Metaverse vision has posted more than $70 billion in losses over the past four years. Little doubt then that Facebook parent's shares rose 4% as the move eased some investor jitters over a bet that CEO Mark Zuckerberg has backed with billions of dollars. ""Smart move, just late,"" told Huber Research Partners analyst Craig Huber to Bloomberg. He added, ""This seems a major shift to align costs with a revenue outlook that surely is not as prosperous as management thought years ago. ""So, what may really be troubling Metaverse? No one can really pinpoint. But as a report in Fortune says, for many people, the problem is that the value proposition is unclear; Metaverse simply doesn’t yet deliver a must-have reason to ditch their smartphones or laptops.Reality Labs is made up of a Metaverse unit and a wearables unit. Within the Metaverse unit, executives are reportedly considering making cuts to VR jobs. As the report says, cuts in resources that high are most likely to include layoffs as early as January.The report comes as Meta scrambles to stay relevant in Silicon Valley's artificial-intelligence race after its Llama 4 model met with a poor reception. To fuel its ambitious goals, Meta has committed as much as $72 billion in capital spending this year. The company reorganized its AI efforts under Superintelligence Labs earlier this year, with Zuckerberg said to be personally leading an aggressive talent acquisition, floating offers for startups and directly courting prospects on WhatsApp with million-dollar pay packages. In fact, Meta's big hiring is said to have triggered a talent war in the Silicon Valley.Last month, Meta Platforms said that it will invest $600 billion in the US infrastructure and jobs over the next three years, including artificial intelligence data centers. Meta has doubled down on AI, with a target of achieving superintelligence. Zuckerberg said Meta is building compute because ""it's the right strategy to aggressively front-load capacity so we're prepared for the most optimistic cases,"" on the company's recent earnings call. Meta has forecast ""notably larger"" capital expenses next year thanks to investments in artificial intelligence, including aggressively building data centers to power its AI push.Incidentally, earlier this week, Zuckerberg announced that Alan Dye, a longtime designer at Apple, is joining Meta to lead a new creative studio inside the Reality Labs division that would focus on design, fashion and technology. Dye will report to Andrew Bosworth, Meta’s chief technology officer, who leads Reality Labs. “We’re entering a new era where A.I. glasses and other devices will change how we connect with technology and each other,” Mr. Zuckerberg said in a post to Threads. “With this new studio, we’re focused on making every interaction thoughtful, intuitive, and built to serve people.”Meta has reportedly delayed the launch of its Mixed Reality Glasses (MR Glasses) from the second half of 2026 to the first half of 2027. According to a report in Business Insider, Meta executives announced the delay after meetings with CEO Mark Zuckerberg is said to have told the team to take more time to make the business sustainable and deliver higher quality experiences.In October 2021, after 17 years of being called Facebook, the social networking giant behind Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus got a new name. Facebook’s corporate entity became Meta. Mark Zuckerberg announced the change at the company’s AR/VR-focused Connect event, sharing that the new title captured more of the company’s core ambition: to build the metaverse.","Reality Labs, Meta's virtual reality unit, is likely to be cut by as much as 30%, according to a report from Bloomberg.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says GAIN act will hurt America 'most'





Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has once again shared a word of caution of America. Recently, Huang cautioned that America’s slow place of infrastructure development cloud hinder the ability of the country to keep up in the global race for the dominance of artificial intelligence. As reported by Fortune, speaking at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, Huang talked about the contrast in the speed of construction in the US with that of China. “If you want to build a data center here in the United States from breaking ground to standing up an AI supercomputer is probably about three years,” he said. “They can build a hospital in a weekend.”Along with the slow pace of US, Huang also stressed on the fact that while US is still ‘generations ahead’ of China in the AI chip technology an semiconductor manufacturing, but this complacency could prove to be dangerous for the US in the long run. “Anybody who thinks China can’t manufacture is missing a big idea,” he warned.Huang also expressed optimism about the future of Nvidia and pointed out that US President Donald Trump’s initiatives to restore reshore manufacturing jobs and spur AI investments.Recently, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang shared his thoughts on the GAIN act. Nvidia has secured a major lobbying victory after US lawmakers excluded the controversial GAIN AI Act from the annual defense policy bill, following intense pressure from CEO Jensen Huang who warned the legislation would harm American competitiveness more than help it.The Guaranteeing Access and Innovation for National Artificial Intelligence (GAIN AI) Act would have required chipmakers like Nvidia and AMD to prioritize US customers over buyers in China and other adversary nations when selling advanced AI processors. The measure was expected to be included in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) set for release this week, but sources confirmed it has been left out of the current draft.Huang met with President Donald Trump and key lawmakers on Wednesday to argue against the proposal. Speaking outside the Capitol, he called lawmakers' decision ""wise"" and claimed the GAIN AI Act would be ""even more detrimental to the United States than the AI Diffusion Act.""","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has once again shared a word of caution of America.

Jamie Dimon the CEO of America’s biggest banks JPMorgan and Chase has now warned that slow bureaucracy of Europe and the economic fragmentation are driving away businesses, investment, and innovation. This in turn is creating risks not only for the continent but also for the United States. As reported by Bloomberg, speaking at the Reagan National Defence Forum, Dimon said, “Europe has a real problem. They do some wonderful things on their safety nets. But they’ve driven business out, they’ve driven investment out, they’ve driven innovation out. It’s kind of coming back.”Along with this, Dimon has also cautioned that a fragmented Europe is one of the biggest challenges faced by the world. Earlier this year, in his annual shareholders letter, Dimon noted that Europe has “serious issues to fix.” While praising the creation of the euro and Europe’s pursuit of peace, Dimon warned that reduced military efforts and difficulties in reaching consensus within the European Union threaten the continent’s stability.“If they fragment, then you can say that America first will not be around anymore. It will hurt us more than anybody else because they are a major ally in every single way, including common values, which are really important,” he said, urging Washington to adopt a long-term strategy to strengthen Europe.“A weak Europe is bad for us.”The comments made by Dimon clings with recent announcement made by JPMorgan to funnel $1.5 trillion into industries that bolster US economic security and resiliency over the next decade — $500 billion more than previously planned.The initiative will mainly focus on supply chain and advanced manufacturing, defense and aerospace, energy independence and resilience and also frontier and strategic technologies.Along with this, JPMorgan will also invest up to $10 billion of its own capital to enable combines expand and innovate in strategic manufacturing.Separately, Dimon commended President Trump’s efforts to cut government bureaucracy. “There is no question that this administration is trying to bring an axe to some of the bureaucracy that held back America. That is a good thing and we can do it and still keep the world safe, for safe food and safe banks and all the stuff like that,” he said.","JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has warned that slow bureaucracy of Europe and the economic fragmentation are driving away businesses, investment, and innovation.

Elon Musk's Starlink has revealed the residential satellite internet pricing for India at Rs 8,600 monthly, plus a Rs 34,000 hardware kit, as the SpaceX subsidiary prepares for commercial operations. The service targets households in remote and underserved areas with promises of unlimited data, 99.9% uptime, and weather-resistant connectivity where traditional broadband infrastructure fails to reach.Following regulatory clearance from the Department of Telecommunications in July, Starlink is positioning itself to challenge established players Jio-SES and Eutelsat OneWeb in India's satellite communications sector.The residential plan, priced at a monthly subscription cost of Rs 8,600 offers unlimited data without usage caps or throttling, addressing critical connectivity gaps in rural regions.

Gold price prediction today: Where are gold prices headed this week and should you 'buy on dips'? Top factors to watch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-price-prediction-today-where-are-gold-rates-headed-on-december-09-2025-and-in-the-near-term-mcx-gold-silver-prices/articleshow/125860611.cms,"Support is at $4160/$4115/$4085/$4050. Resistance is at $4245/$4300/$4381 (all-time high). (AI image)

Gold Performance:

On December 8, spot gold traded in a rather narrow range of $4176-$4219 as US yields spiked higher. At the time of writing this article, the yellow metal was trading at $4192, down 0.1% for the day, while the MCX February gold contract at Rs 129,770 was down 0.36%.

Earlier, in the week ending December 5, the yellow metal closed with a weekly loss of nearly 0.95% at $4198.

US Dollar and yields:

At the time of writing this article, the US Dollar Index, boosted by higher yields, was hovering around 99.20, up around 0.20% for the day.

Ten-year US yields at 4.17% were up by 0.90%, while 2-year yields at 3.59% were up around 1%.

US treasury yields climbed to the highest in more than two months on huge issuance by the Treasury (in total $119 billion this week) and inflation concerns as the Fed cuts rate into elevated inflation.

New York Treasury term premia, a measure of premium creeping higher, has risen to 0.7% -- around September level.

Fed Watch:

The markets are placing 90% odds on the FOMC cutting Fed Fund rate by 25 bps on December 10. Thereafter, markets assign 90% probability of the Fed cutting one more time by April.

ETFs and COMEX inventory:

As of December 5, total known global gold ETF holdings stood at 97.84MOz, highest since October 24. ETF holdings have risen 18% YTD (or 15 MOz, equivalent to 466 tons of net inflow).

Eligible COMEX Gold inventory stood at 18.277 MOz as of December 5, which is down 18.58% from the all-time high level of 22.45 seen in April 2025.

China's central extends its gold buying spree:

China's Central Bank PBoC increased its gold reserves again as it extended its gold buying spree to a 13th straight month as it bought 30,000 Ounces (around 1 ton) of gold.

China's forex reserves surged to the highest level since 2016 to nearly $3.35 trillion.

Bank for International Settlements (BIS) on gold:

According to the BIS, retail investors' gold buying frenzy has pushed the yellow metal out of its traditional safe haven pattern to a more speculative asset. The Bank added that while institutional investors bought gold to hedge their positions in over-extended equities, the retail investors' buying has amplified the trend. It also noted the fact that both equities and gold have been rallying together for the past few quarters, which is a rare occurrence in at least the last fifty years. The Bank cited the case of gold crashing in 1980s.

Data and event roundup:

Japan's 3Q annualized GDP came in at -2.3% as weak housing and exports weighed on the economy. However, this contraction is being seen as a blip. China's November trade surplus widened to $111.70 (forecast $103.10 billion) from $90.10 billion in October.

China's trade surplus exceeded $1 trillion for the first time.

China's Politburo, in its December huddle, has cited boosting domestic demand as its top goal in 2026 as top leaders pledged to strengthen cross-cyclical policy measures as they keep proactive fiscal and moderately loose monetary policies as possible tools to achieve their goals. The budget deficit target for 2026 could be around this year's 4% target.

US data released on Friday did little to change Fed rate cut probability. Real Personal spending in September stagnated Vs forecast of a 0.1% increase m-o-m. PCE Price Index data (Sep.), core PCE Price Index rose 2.8% y-o-y (forecast 2.8%, prior 2.7%). University of Michigan Sentiment (Dec. prel.) came in at 53.3 Vs the estimate of 52; it continues to be mired around historical low. One-year inflation expectations eased from 4.5% to 4.1% Vs the estimate of 4.5%.

Upcoming data:

Major US data on tap this week include JOLTs job openings (December 9), Employment cost index (Dec. 10) and trade balance (Dec. 11). Out of Asia, focus will be on China's new Yuan loans, PPI and CPI (Dec. 10).

However, the most important event of the week is upcoming Fed's monetary policy due on December 10, wherein the central bank is widely expected to cut the Fed Fund rate by 25 bps to 3.50%-3.75% target range. In addition to the rate decision, investors will pay close attention to the Fed's summary of projections which will include the Fed's forecasts of inflation, GDP and unemployment, too.

Gold Price Outlook:

Spot gold is well supported on rate cut expectations, rising fiscal concerns, deteriorating US job market and global trade flows suffering due to tariff wars. Geopolitical tensions remain elevated as the Ukraine talks have failed to make any headway. Also, President Trump calling for revival of Monroe doctrines is positive for the metal in the medium to long term.

Should the US nonfarm payroll report show continuing weakness in the job market, the yellow metal can reach new record highs soon.

Buying the dips is advisable.

Support is at $4160/$4115/$4085/$4050. Resistance is at $4245/$4300/$4381 (all-time high).

Silver Price Outlook:

Silver ETFs have recorded a net inflow of 132.50 MOz YTD as of December 6, which is equivalent to a net inflow of around 4121 tons. ETF holdings are up 18.50% YTD.

One-month LBMA swap rate, although significantly lower than the October frenzy level of 34.95%, is currently at 6.41%, which is quite elevated as compared to historical standards of 0.3%-0.5%.

We continue to remain bullish on silver as Chinese silver inventories in SHFE and SGE warehouses have fallen to around decade-low levels. In addition, huge ETF inflows continue to keep the metal buoyant despite surging US yields. It is advisable to buy the dips with stoploss below $56.40/$54 for a target of $62 in the coming weeks/months.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

CHANDIGARH: Sudhir , the IT executive who created a stir on Nov 26 by bidding over Rs 1.1 crore for VIP number HR88B-8888 in an online auction, now says the number isn’t worth that much and he won’t bid again.Fond of VIP numbers, he already owns four cars with 0777 endings and said an astrologer advised him that 8888 would be luckier.He said intense bidding pushed him to Rs 1.17 crore. Calling the uproar unnecessary, he said he’ll buy numbers privately. On minister Anil Vij’s inquiry remark, he said he welcomes any probe.Earlier, Speaking to the media, Minister Anil Vij explained that the state allots fancy and VVIP vehicle numbers through an online auction system, which not only enhances the buyer’s prestige but also generates significant revenue for the government.In the recent auction, a Hisar-based bidder offered over Rs 1.1 crore for the number HR88B-8888 — a national record — making headlines, but failed to deposit the money by the deadline.Terming the incident a matter of concern, Vij said the trend of placing excessively high bids without the actual intent or capacity to pay must be curbed. “Placing a bid in the auction is not a pastime — it is a responsibility. I have directed transport officials to thoroughly verify the individual’s income and assets.We must determine whether he truly had the financial capacity to place such a high bid,” he said.Vij added that the transport department will write to the Income Tax Department seeking a comprehensive financial inquiry into the bidder, to ensure the auction system is not misused.He emphasised that such actions undermine the integrity of the auction process and could impact government revenue. “We want to ensure transparency and accountability. If someone bids Rs 1.17 crore, we must verify whether they genuinely have the means to honour that bid,” he said.","Sudhir, the IT executive who created a stir on Nov 26 by bidding over Rs 1.1 crore for VIP number HR88B-8888 in an online auction, now says the number isn’t worth that much.

Indiana Jones moment at Konark: ASI drills into chamber sealed in 1903,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/indiana-jones-moment-at-konark-asi-drills-into-chamber-sealed-in-1903/articleshow/125860862.cms,"The hole is being drilled between the first and second pidha — the stepped horizontal tiers — on the western wall

BHUBANESWAR: Drums once thundered beneath its vast stone roof. Priests moved through shafts of light. The Jagamohan - the grand assembly hall of the 13th-century Sun Temple in Konark - was built to hold the living pulse of a kingdom. Today, the same sacred chamber lies entombed in silence, its interior packed with tonnes of sand that kept the hall standing - and hidden - for 122 years.This weekend, Archaeological Survey of India pierced that silence. Engineers began drilling a narrow hole into the western wall of the Jagamohan - the first physical breach in the sand-filled chamber since the British packed it tight and sealed it shut in 1903. The drilling marks a decisive step in a long-debated plan to remove the sand and reveal what years of hidden damp and pressure may have done to one of India's most celebrated works of sacred architecture - rising from the edge of the Bay of Bengal in Odisha's Puri district.The hole is being drilled between the first and second pidha - the stepped horizontal tiers - on the western wall. It is the exact point where colonial engineers once poured sand into the collapsing hall under orders from Sir John Woodburn, then lieutenant governor of Bengal, fearing the structure would otherwise crumble.The move comes five years after then Union culture minister Prahlad Singh Patel directed the agency to remove the sand to assess internal damage.Over that period, ASI built a special platform, designed to let experts extract sand without destabilising the monument.An ASI official said the current phase involves core drilling to test the hidden strength of the wall before any large-scale excavation begins. ""The next step will be to create a pocket or a frame through which a tunnel will be dug out to remove the sand. This is a preliminary assessment of the wall because there are no records about its condition and stability,"" the official said.The operation revisits fears that first surfaced nearly 70 years ago. In the mid-1950s, former ASI director general Dr Debala Mitra had carried out exploratory work inside the sealed hall. Her studies revealed that rainwater seeping into the closed interior had triggered the growth of harmful moss due to persistent dampness. That moisture was accelerating the decomposition of the khondalite stone that forms the backbone of the monument, she had said.Those warnings were confirmed in 2019, when the Roorkee-based Central Building Research Institute examined the structure. Its report found that the sand inside the Jagamohan had settled by nearly 12ft, and that stone blocks from the upper portion of the hall were already dislodging and falling - a sign of invisible stress building within the sealed core.Designed as a colossal stone chariot for the sun god, Surya, complete with 24 carved wheels and seven horses, the temple once served as a centre of ritual, astronomy and royal power. Over centuries, cyclones, salt-laden winds, shifting sands and rising coastal moisture linked to climate change have eaten into its surfaces, turning conservation into a perpetual race against time.What lies inside this Unesco World Heritage Site remains an open question: intact carvings preserved in darkness, or stone reduced to powder by decades of damp.","The Jagamohan - the grand assembly hall of the 13th-century Sun Temple in Konark - was built to hold the living pulse of a kingdom.

He said imports were challenging domestic producers and reiterated his intent to address the issue.Trump said he would ""take care"" of alleged dumping of Indian rice into the US. Farmers have pointed to falling rice prices, claiming imports from countries like India, Vietnam and Thailand are undercutting their crops. ""They shouldn't be dumping,"" Trump said. ""I mean, I heard that, I heard that from others. You can't do that.""He also suggested possible tariff measures on fertiliser coming from Canada to encourage local production. ""A lot of it does come in from Canada, and so we'll end up putting very severe tariffs on that, if we have to, because that's the way you want to bolster here,"" he said, adding, ""And we can do it here. We can all do that here.""The comments came amid ongoing economic pressures, including concerns about inflation and consumer prices. Farmers, a key support base for Trump, have faced rising costs and market challenges linked to tariff policies.Negotiations with both Canada and India aimed at stabilising trade ties have encountered difficulties. Earlier this year, Trump imposed 50% tariffs on Indian goods, citing trade barriers and energy purchases. A US delegation is expected to visit India this week for further talks, although no major breakthrough is anticipated.Trump has also previously raised tariff concerns with Canada, including threats to increase duties on products not covered by the North American trade deal. Recent statements have suggested the possibility of revisiting the agreement itself.","US President Donald Trump may impose new tariffs on agricultural imports, including Indian rice and Canadian fertilizers. Trump said he would ""take care"" of alleged dumping of Indian rice into the US. He also suggested possible tariff measures on fertiliser coming from Canada to encourage local production.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125854946,imgsize-44386,width-400,resizemode-4/us-president-donald-trump.jpg"

Pakistan will hold bidding on December 23 to sell its state-owned carrier, Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), state media reported on Wednesday.The loss-making airline is being privatised as part of a $7 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) program , which requires the federal government to reform or divest struggling state enterprises. A previous attempt to offload PIA last year was scrapped after the government failed to receive a sufficiently attractive offer.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met with corporate entities and company representatives involved in the process, according to a press release shared by state broadcaster PTV News. “PIA’s bidding will take place on December 23, which will be broadcast live on all media. We are ensuring transparency and merit in the privatisation process,” the statement quoted him as saying.Sharif said the process was proceeding “smoothly” and argued that privatisation would help restore the airline’s “lost prestige,” align it with modern aviation requirements and facilitate the restoration of PIA’s global flight operations — a step he said was crucial for overseas Pakistanis.If completed, the transaction would mark Pakistan’s first major privatisation in nearly two decades.Founded in October 1946, PIA is based at Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport, the country’s second-busiest airport and its largest city’s main aviation hub.","Pakistan will hold bidding on December 23 to sell its state-owned carrier, Pakistan International Airlines.
