"10 centres in Haryana, 8 in Kottayam score well above average in NEET-UG",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/10-centres-in-haryana-8-in-kottayam-score-well-above-average-in-neet-ug/articleshow/111912756.cms,"Most ‘high-performing’ centres had just 3-4 students with 700+ scores

An initial analysis of data on city and centre-wise NEET-UG scores put out by National Testing Agency shows that there are 10 centres in Haryana and eight in Kerala where more than 5% of candidates scored over 650 (out of 720). That proportion is more than three times the national average of 1.3% students getting that score. Unlike in Kerala, where all such centres are in Kottayam , a well-known coaching hub, in Haryana they are from eight cities.Other than Rajasthan's Sikar, which grabbed headlines for the maximum number of centres with high proportion of 650-plus students, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Chandigarh, Vijayawada and Malappuram had many centres where proportion of such students was well above national average.Several centres in Haryana also had a high proportion of those scoring over 600. But the clustering of scores above 700 was seen more in two centres in Gujarat, with nine students in one centre in Rajkot and another in Ahmedabad managing the feat.With the exception of these two centres in Gujarat, a majority of the ‘high performing’ centres had just three to four students at best who scored over 700.In many of the Haryana centres, the proportion of candidates who scored 600 was also much higher compared to many other centres. For instance, 22.7% of the students who appeared for the test at the Delhi Public School in Rewari scored more than 600. This was the highest proportion for any centre not just in Haryana, and would be among the highest for any state.Centres in Rewari, Mahendragarh, Gurgaon, Hisar, Bhiwani and Sirsa in Haryana outdid the centres in Gujarat, Delhi and Kerala when it came to having a high proportion of candidates who scored over 650 and 600. The 650-mark is significant because it is widely perceived as a rough indicator of the possibility of getting into the much-soughtafter govt medical colleges, which offer both quality medical education and relatively modest fees.",There are 10 centres in Haryana and eight in Kerala where more than 5% of candidates scored over 650 (out of 720) That proportion is more than three times the national average of 1.3% students getting that score.

It's possible to leave teeth marks in objects containing pure gold, silver, or copper because they are all soft metals.This biting technique was used to ascertain the authenticity of gold coins and other gold items.

The composition of modern-day Olympic medals is no secret: gold medals are mostly comprised of sterling silver, while bronze metals are actually made of copper.The tradition of Olympians biting their medals has persisted over the years, not as a means of verifying the purity of precious metals, but simply as a more engaging and intriguing pose compared to merely smiling for the cameras.Furthermore, although they are not exerting significant force when biting their medals, this pose allows Olympians to showcase their apparent strength in an entertaining manner.","Historically, teeth have served purposes beyond mere eating, speaking, and smiling.

Budget 2024 expectations : In the intricate realm of tax regulations, simplicity holds paramount importance. The current landscape of tax collection at source ( TCS ) and tax deduction at source ( TDS ) is far from straightforward. With varying thresholds and a multiplicity of rates spanning from 0.1% to 40%, navigating these provisions has become akin to navigating a labyrinth, fraught with complexities and pitfalls.This complexity not only creates confusion but also leads to disputes, culminating in the locking up of working capital, hindering growth and development. In light of these challenges, there is a need to rationalize and simplify the provisions to promote clarity and efficiency.It should be kept in mind that withholding tax is a vicarious collection of tax and that the tax authorities can always have recourse to the primary taxpayer. Even in the case of non-resident taxpayers, the tax authorities can have recourse to treaty provisions for assistance in tax collection. There is also a comprehensive information collection system in place to obtain data on income and transactions such as Annual Information Statements, returns filed for Specified Financial Transactions, declaration of remittances in Form 15CA and 15CB, etc . Apart from the income-tax system, the government collects information about transactions under other laws such as GST. Accordingly, the government may contemplate the following measures:Also Check | Budget 2024 Expectations Live Updates: Income Tax changes, record capex for roads and railways expected from FM Nirmala Sitharaman The current plethora of TDS rates and provisions engenders a convoluted system that needs simplification. To this end, the government may undertake the formulation of a comprehensive roadmap aimed at reducing the prevailing disparity in TDS provisions and rates. By consolidating payments into two or three categories, the TDS framework can be streamlined, fostering a more cohesive and comprehensible system. Several disputes arise not because of non-deduction but only because of differing views on the rate of tax. These disputes can be minimized if the number of rates is rationalized.The essence of income-tax lies in levy of tax on income, rather than on expenses. Given that GST already applies to most expenses, the imposition of TCS appears redundant. A prudent course of action would entail either the abolition or the rationalization of TCS provisions, eliminating superfluous layers of taxation and promoting efficiency within the tax regime.This is more so as regards the imposition of TCS on the sale of goods and TDS on the purchase of goods. This poses a formidable challenge characterized by compliance ambiguity. While in theory only one provision will apply, in several practical situations such a determination is difficult and time consuming. To mitigate these challenges, a harmonized approach is imperative, whereby one of the two provisions (preferably TCS) is dropped. Alternatively, regular taxpayers may be afforded the flexibility to opt for lower or nil tax deduction/collection certificates.Such pragmatic measures will not only simplify compliance but also enhance the ease of doing business, fostering a conducive environment for economic growth.Ambiguities surrounding the definition of critical terms such as ""goods"" undermine the efficacy of the tax framework, giving rise to interpretational discrepancies and disputes. To address this issue, precise definitions must be formulated, aligning with related statutes to obviate confusion and ease compliance.The absence of explicit provisions pertaining to credit for taxes paid outside India imparts an element of rigidity within the tax framework, hindering the facilitation of foreign tax credit (FTC). To address this lacuna, employers should be permitted to provide credit for taxes paid abroad while withholding taxes on salaries, with requisite amendments being made to facilitate the disclosure of FTC in relevant forms.Employees of multinationals are often provided with an option to participate in the employee stock option plan of the overseas parent. Acquisition of such shares by employees is being treated as a payment under LRS which is subject to levy of TCS. Such taxpayers are already paying taxes on income arising from exercise of stock options as a prerequisite which are deducted by the employer. Levy of both TDS and TCS impacts cash flow for employees since stock options are perquisites in kind and not in cash and they will be able to claim credit of TCS only after filing the return of income. To alleviate this burden, amendments may be enacted, enabling the adjustment of any TCS collected on such remittances against the TDS on salaries.Ambiguities surrounding the withholding of taxes on year-end provisions necessitate resolution to ensure fairness and certainty. Withholding should be predicated upon the actual crystallization of expenses, rather than estimations and avoiding a hyper-technical approach in favor of a pragmatic approach that engenders ease of compliance.There are certain overlapping provisions, such as whether a particular service is a ‘technical service' or a 'contract for work' (194J v. 194C) or whether it is ‘professional service’ or ‘technical service’ (194 J(a) v 194J (b)), payment for lease or use of plant and machinery (194-I v. 194J). These overlapping engenders confusion and inefficiencies. To rectify these anomalies, efforts must be made to elucidate and clarify existing provisions, fostering coherence and consistency.According to section 201, if a person who is required to deduct TDS fails to do so, or after deducting TDS fails to deposit the same with the government, he shall be deemed to be an assessee in default. This could result in a penalty under section 221. In addition, non-deduction could lead to a penalty under section 271C. This represents a potential double burden on taxpayers. By streamlining penalty provisions, the framework may be rendered more equitable so that double jeopardy is avoided.Disallowance may occur when taxes are not withheld as per section 40(a)(i) or (ia), and separately demands may be raised under section 201(1) for these omissions. Eliminating this duplication could be achieved by abolishing disallowance under section 40(a)(i) or (ia) as section 201(1) is adequate to compensate for the loss of revenue. Alternatively, a clarification may be inserted that only one of the two provisions will apply.The measures proposed above have the potential to streamline withholding provisions and alleviate the administrative burden on deductors. It may also be kept in mind that the deductors are performing the task of tax collection on behalf of the government. It is reasonable to expect that deductors are fairly compensated for undertaking the responsibility. This could be achieved through the payment of fees commensurate with the workload or the revenue collected.",Tax collection at source and tax deduction at source ( TDS) is far from straightforward. The current plethora of TDS rates and provisions engenders a convoluted system that needs simplification. The government may undertake the formulation of a comprehensive roadmap aimed at reducing the prevailing disparity in TDS provisions and rates.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111898479,imgsize-222246,width-400,resizemode-4/111898479.jpg"
Disabled candidate not given any service despite clearing UPSC 4 times,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/disabled-candidate-not-given-any-service-despite-clearing-upsc-4-times/articleshow/111895006.cms,"NEW DELHI:

'Cerebral palsy allowed for IAS, why not muscular dystrophy?

In the midst of the row over trainee IAS officer Puja Khedkar allegedly misusing the disability quota, a case has surfaced of a candidate with muscular dystrophy being denied any service despite having cleared the civil services four times.Kartik Kansal, who studied mechanical engineering in IIT Roorkee, is currently a scientist in Isro, a post for which he was selected through all-India central recruitment.Kartik, who has been using a wheelchair since the age of 14, was selected for the civil services four times - in 2019 (rank 813), 2021 (271), 2022 (784) and 2023 (829).In 2021, when he was ranked 271, even without a disability quota he ought to have got the IAS, since that year those ranked 272 and 273 got IAS. However, in 2021, muscular dystrophy was not included in the list of conditions in functional classification eligible for IAS.Muscular dystrophy was included in the list for Indian Revenue Service (income Tax) Group A and Indian Revenue Service (Customs and Excise), which were his second and third choices.In 2019, when Kartik Kansal got 813 rank, he could easily have been allotted a service as there were 15 vacancies for locomotor disability and only 14 were filled. In 2021, there were seven vacancies in the locomotor disability category and only four were filled. He ranked number one in the category.The medical board in AIIMS certified that he had muscular weakness and both his arms and legs were affected by muscular dystrophy. Inexplicably, for IAS, persons with both arms and legs affected are eligible but persons with muscular dystrophy are not. The board noted that he ""can do manipulation with fingers with difficulty and can do mobility with motorised wheelchair"". It also certified that he could see, hear speak, communicate, read and write though he could not stand, walk, pull, push, lift, crouch, bend, kneel, jump or climb. Though his original disability certificate put his level of disability at 60%, the AIIMS medical board deemed it 90%.A retired IAS officer, Sanjeev Gupta, took up Kartik's cause and tweeted in his support pointing out that it was a travesty of justice that Kartik who wrote the civil services without even using a scribe except for help in going to the toilet, and who met all the physical requirements for the job of IAS and IRS was not given any service.When he sought the reason for rejection through the central portal for grievance redressal, he got a reply stating: ""PWBD candidates are allocated service as per the functional classification and physical requirements prescribed by different cadre controlling authorities. There were no matching services at your turn as per your rank.""""Why should functional classifications and physical requirements for similar nature of work vary across services? If cerebral palsy is allowed for IAS, why not muscular dystrophy? Thankfully, since 2024 everything has been merged into one. There will be no such errors now. As per the new merged criteria too, Kartik is eligible to get IAS and true justice will be done by giving him IAS if there is a carry forward vacancy from previous years. This will partly undo the injustice meted out to him till now,"" said Gupta.""By joining the civil services, I wanted to prove that even people like me can do it. But I cannot comment further on the issue since it is sub judice,"" said Kartik, whose case pertaining to this issue is pending in Central Administrative Tribunal.","Kartik Kansal has been using a wheelchair since the age of 14. He was selected for the civil services four times - in 2019 (rank 813), 2021 (271), 2022 (784) and 2023 (829) In 2021, when he was ranked 271, even without a disability quota he ought to have got the IAS.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111895386,imgsize-1111128,width-400,resizemode-4/111895386.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Skewed distribution of rainfall in June-July saw nine states , including Jharkhand, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Odisha and Bihar, facing a significant rain deficit in the range of 20-49% whereas six states, including four in the south peninsula, reported excess to large excess of cumulative rainfall during June 1-July 20.State-wise, Jharkhand reported the highest deficit (49%) while Tamil Nadu recorded the highest surplus (83%) than their respective normal rainfall during the period.Overall, the country reported over 1% of deficit in cumulative rainfall with northwest (14% deficit) and east & northeast (12% deficit) India taking the biggest hit as on Saturday. Deficit was slightly reduced in the past 24 hours due to rains in Odisha, Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh caused by a depression over the Odisha coast.Region-wise, central India has no deficit, whereas the south peninsula reported 26% more than normal rainfall so far. Barring a few days of expected good rainfall this month, the overall situation may not improve much.There is a possibility of a weak phase of monsoon in early Aug due to delay in formation of La Nina - a climate condition associated with the periodic cooling of ocean surface temperatures in the central and east-central equatorial Pacific. It is linked to good monsoon rainfall in the Indian sub-continent. Rainfall situation in the deficit zones (northwest and east & northeast) will improve with the formation of La Nina in the later part of next month or in early Sept.The deficit, however, has so far not affected the kharif (summer sown) crop sowing operation as a large part of monsoon core zone (areas dependent on seasonal rains for farming operations) in the country received normal rainfall this month, improving even water storage in the major 150 reservoirs in many states. Data from Central Water Commission shows that the overall live storage improved from 20% of total storage capacity of these reservoirs on June 27 to 29% on July 18.The overall acreage of kharif crops, including paddy, pulses and oilseeds, showed a higher sown area this year so far compared to the corresponding period last year. A huge deficit (11%) of rainfall in June delayed the sowing operation but farmers could increase acreage during the month with the help of groundwater and other irrigation facilities, compared to the same period last year when India reported a slightly less (9%) deficit in 2023.Surprisingly, farmers so far this season don't appear enthused by the pitch around millets, nutri-cereals, which show decline in acreage at a time when over 60% of the kharif sowing operation is complete in the country. Their acreage as on Friday declined by 8% compared to the corresponding period last year, whereas the acreage of paddy rose by 7%.Higher total acreage can be attributed to focus on sowing of pulses and oilseeds, which reported over 15 lakh hectares (21% increase) and 12 lakh hectares (8% increase), respectively, more sown area as on Friday. A better prospect of procurement of paddy, pulses and oilseeds encouraged farmers to opt for these crops instead of millets whose procurement could not match the popular crops despite govt's focus on it during 'International Year of Millet' last year.Acreage data, released by the ministry on Friday, shows that the total area under coverage for all kharif crops has risen to 704 lakh hectares till July 19 against 680 lakh hectares in the same period last year.","Nine states, including Jharkhand, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Odisha and Bihar, facing a significant rain deficit in the range of 20-49%.

KOLKATA: Bengal Police on Saturday registered an FIR against steel firm CEO Dinesh Saraogi for alleged sexual assault on a 28-year-old woman on a July 16 Kolkata-Abu Dhabi flight. Separately, Vulcan Green Steel , the Jindal Group firm that Saraogi heads, placed him on "" administrative leave and appointed an independent third-party"" for an internal probe.Saraogi has been booked under provisions that could land him in jail for up to five years on conviction.The FIR was filed after the woman's parents went to Kolkata airport police station and submitted a formal complaint. The woman was on her way to the US when Saraogi allegedly showed her porn and groped her. She had described her ordeal in a detailed social media post.""I wasn't able to forgive myself for letting the man go. But now that a case has been registered, I hope I will get justice,"" the woman told TOI from Boston on Saturday. Saraogi was detained after disembarking at Abu Dhabi but was let off as the woman had a connecting flight to Boston and was unable to go to the police station there to lodge an official complaint.Saraogi has been booked under sections 74 (assault or use of criminal force with intent to outrage modesty), 75 (sexual harassment) and 79 (uttering words or making sound or gesture or exhibit any object that insults the modesty of a woman and intrudes upon her privacy) of Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita (BNS), said police.""We will record the woman's statement over video call as she is in the US and will proceed with the investigation,"" said a senior officer of Bidhannagar City Police. Kolkata airport falls under Bidhannagar Police.Police were trying to reach Saraogi in Oman, where he is currently based, and a notice will be sent to his registered addresses to appear for investigation, the officer said.Speaking to TOI on Saturday, the woman's father explained further why his daughter could not lodge the complaint in Abu Dhabi itself. ""The Kolkata-Abu Dhabi flight was already 40 minutes late and the only flight to Boston for that day would have departed in barely an hour. She couldn't take the risk as she had a visa compliance that required her to re-enter the country within a certain time frame and she couldn't afford a 24-hour delay,"" the father said. He expressed happiness with the cooperation of the Bengal police in lodging the FIR.TOI's multiple calls to Saraogi on Saturday went unanswered. There was no response to text messages, either.

The textbook also undergoes notable modifications, such as the omission of caste-based discrimination, alterations to BR Ambedkar's experiences with discrimination, and the rebranding of the Harappan civilisation as the ""Sindhu-Sarasvati"" civilisation.The textbook elaborates on the ""madhya rekha,"" stating, "" The Greenwich Meridian is not the first prime meridian.There were others in the past. In fact, many centuries before Europe, India had a prime meridian of its own! It was called madhya rekhā (or 'middle line') and passed through the city of Ujjayinī (today Ujjain), which was a reputed center for astronomy over many centuries. Varāhamihira, a famous astronomer, lived and worked there some 1,500 years ago. Indian astronomers were aware of the concepts of latitude and longitude, including the need for a zero or prime meridian. The Ujjayinī meridian became a reference for calculations in all Indian astronomical texts.”The textbook, titled ""Exploring Society India and Beyond,"" accentuates the ""Sarasvati"" river's significance to early Indian civilisation, identifying it as the seasonal ""Ghaggar"" in India and ""Hakra"" in Pakistan, while referring to the Harappan civilisation as the ""Sindhu-Sarasvati"" civilisation.The revised textbook incorporates information on the Vedas but excludes references to the caste system and the preclusion of women and Shudras from studying these scriptures.

Shudras could not perform any rituals. Often women were grouped with Shudras. Both women and Shudras were not allowed to study the Vedas,"" and ""The priests also said that these groups were decided based on birth.

Kerala issues first-ever guidelines for treatment of rare Amoebic Meningoencephalitis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kerala-issues-first-ever-guidelines-for-treatment-of-rare-amoebic-meningoencephalitis/articleshow/111907308.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Kerala health department on Sunday issued special guidelines for the treatment of amoebic meningoencephalitis , marking the first such initiative in the country. This rare brain infection , caused by free-living amoeba present in contaminated waters, has claimed several lives in Kerala in recent times.Health minister Veena George announced the release of a technical guideline aimed at preventing, diagnosing, and treating this condition.Due to the limited scientific studies and reports available on this rare disease, the government decided to develop a comprehensive guideline based on existing research and observations.To further advance the understanding of amoebic meningoencephalitis, a panel will be established in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). This panel will focus on conducting additional studies and research related to the disease. Minister George has instructed both government and private hospitals to adhere strictly to the guidelines provided.The health department's previously issued advisory said, ""Bathing in stagnant water and diving in water should be avoided as much as possible as this disease has been reported in Kerala. Water in theme parks and swimming pools should be properly chlorinated to ensure that it is clean.""Minister Veena George urged individuals experiencing prolonged fever or other symptoms such as shortness of breath with fever, excessive palpitation, chest pain, slurred speech, loss of consciousness, blood in sputum, or excessive fatigue to seek expert treatment.The most recent victim of this rare brain infection in Kerala was a 14-year-old boy who passed away earlier this month, marking the fourth case reported in the state since May, with all patients being children.According to medical experts, amoebic meningoencephalitis occurs when free-living, non-parasitic amoebae bacteria enter the body through the nose from contaminated water. The amoeba responsible for this condition, Naegleria fowleri, thrives in warm freshwater environments such as lakes, rivers, and hot springs.Once the amoeba enters the body, it travels to the brain, causing a rare and often fatal infection of the brain and its surrounding tissues, known as primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). Before the recent cases, this disease was reported in the coastal district of Alappuzha in Kerala in 2023 and 2017.",Kerala health department issues special guidelines for the treatment of amoebic meningoencephalitis.

Officials explained that a 'zero' score does not necessarily mean blank answer sheets were submitted or the questions were not attempted. ""It is plausible that the candidate attempted some questions correctly and some questions incorrectly, which led to the negative score.""In NEET-UG, four marks are awarded for correct answers, while incorrect answers lead to deduction of one mark. Unattempted questions do not result in any marks being awarded or deducted.The results, released on the direction of Supreme Court, indicate that while candidates allegedly involved in irregularities have not performed well, some centres have a high concentration of well-performing students. Over 2,000 candidates from centres in Rajasthan's Sikar, one of the popular coaching hubs, scored above 650 marks, while another 4,000 scored above 600 marks.

Andhra CM N Chandrababu Naidu has submitted a list of projects, including an oil refinery, on which it wants Centre's announcements, with some of them sought in the Budget.As reported by TOI on July 15, JDU has flagged flood control as a priority issue given that it involves water flowing from Nepal, which cannot be dealt with at the state level. On Sunday, Jha highlighted how Bihar CM has repeatedly flagged the demand for special status but provided greater leeway to Union FM Nirmala Sitharman who will present the Budget on Tuesday in allocating funds for infrastructure and specific projects in the state.After the meeting, TDP MP Lavu Sri Krishna Devarayalu said party lawmakers have sought more time during the Budget session that starts on Monday to highlight the issues on which white papers have been released.While the Centre has repeatedly said that a special category status cannot be accorded now, given the 14th Finance Commission recommendations, the demand has not gone away with BJD demanding the tag for Odisha pointing that BJP had promised it as part of its 2014 poll campaign. Odisha is now among the better performers on fiscal parameters.Special category status, which was originally designed for hilly and border states, ensured that the Centre provided additional funds.While Andhra has a weak fiscal position, Naidu and his team have realised that it will be more prudent to focus on getting their specific demands addressed. TDP's rival YSR Congress, however, demanded the status for the state, something that Jairam Ramesh of Congress, which has been encouraging TDP to up the ante on the demand for special category tag, highlighted.""In today's all-party meeting of floor leaders chaired by defence minister Rajnath Singh, the JDU functionary demanded special status of Bihar. The YSRCP member demanded special status for Andhra. Strangely, the TDP member kept quiet on the matter,"" he tweeted.",JDU and TDP did not press for'special category' status for Bihar and Andhra. Instead they suggested that there could be special packages to meet specific requirements. TDP MP Lavu Sri Krishna Devarayalu said party lawmakers have sought more time during the Budget session that starts on Monday.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111909629,imgsize-36370,width-400,resizemode-4/111909629.jpg"

Railways introduces AI-based technology to ensure clean linen for passengers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/railways-introduces-ai-based-technology-to-ensure-clean-linen-for-passengers/articleshow/111908182.cms,"NEW DELHI: Indian Railways is looking at AI-camera based technology solutions to address the perennial problem of dirty linen supplied to train passengers. Railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw has inaugurated one such machine that automatically segregates dirty linens with stains and damages using artificial intelligence (AI) before final packing.Railways uses around six lakh packets of linens daily.Each packet includes two bedsheets, one pillow cover, a hand towel and one blanket. Officials said dirty linen is a common problem and the railways receives regular complaints from passengers.Officials said the first state-of-the-art “stain and damage” detection machine designed specifically for cotton bedsheets of size 1400X2500 mm is being used in Pune, which Vaishnaw has inaugurated. The machine uses high resolution cameras for capturing detailed images of bedsheets, which ensures high accuracy in detection.The Indian Railways has 80 mechanised laundries across the country. Vaishnaw said currently only 2% linen are sample checked and those found not cleaned are rejected. “This (new machine) is an experiment and we will use this across the country as the technology develops. We plan to use this in the laundries in Central Railway and Western Railway . Then it will be used across all the zones in the country,” the minister said.In this system, bedsheets are loaded onto the conveyor system manually, initiating the detection process. The machine uses a pinching conveyor system for efficient transport of bedsheets through the detection area at a controlled speed. During this process the cameras capture detailed images. Subsequently, the images are processed in real-time detection software.“The software uses advanced machine learning algorithms to identify and classify stains and damages with 100% accuracy. The system records and stores the percentage stains and damages on each bedsheet. The focus is on quality control,” said a railway official. He added this will ensure passengers get properly washed linen.","Railways uses around six lakh packets of linens daily.

Income Tax Expectations Budget 2024: The Narendra Modi government has been pushing for the adoption of the new income tax regime that offers concessional income tax rates, but with negligible exemptions. The new income tax regime was first introduced in 2020 and in the 2023 Budget further tweaks were made to popularise it amongst the common man and middle class salaried taxpayers.Further, the new income tax regime was made the default regime, signalling the government's intent to push for it as the main tax regime.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the first Budget 2024 of the Modi 3.0 government on July 23, 2024. Expectations are high that more changes may be brought in the new income tax regime - possibly raising the basic exemption limit, hiking standard deduction, or/and rationalising the income tax slabs and tax rates further.Also Check | Budget 2024 Expectations Live Updates: Income Tax changes, record capex for roads and railways expected from FM Nirmala Sitharaman So what can salaried taxpayers expect from Budget 2024 for the new income tax regime? Times of India Online did an exclusive survey of top personal tax experts. Here’s what they had to say:Tax experts are divided on the ideal tax income tax slabs and income tax rates under the new tax regime. However, most agree that the 30% tax slab above an income of Rs 15 lakh is still steep and needs to be implemented at incomes of at least above Rs 20 lakh.Aarti Raote, Partner, Deloitte India says that the government may not look at rejigging the tax rates up to 25% slab under the new tax regime. Rather, the government may look to increase the threshold of Rs 15 lakh to Rs 20 lakh for the 30% tax rate under the new tax regime.“In addition, the basic exemption limit of Rs 3 lakh can be moved to Rs 5 lakh. Additionally, increasing the standard deduction to Rs 1 lakh from existing levels of Rs 50,000 would provide further relief and encourage compliance,” she tells TOI.Chander Talreja, Partner, Vialto Partners tells TOI, “This year, the government may provide relief to middle income level individuals by tweaking the slab rates further and introducing additional slabs for income ranging between Rs 15 lakh and Rs 20 lakh.” Chander recommends the following income tax slabs and rates for salaried taxpayers under the new income tax regime:Preeti Sharma, Partner, Tax & Regulatory Services, BDO India LLP says that the applicable tax rate of 30% on the income of Rs 15 lakh is a very steep increase from 5% at the income level of Rs 3 lakh. “The applicable tax rate on income of Rs 15 lakh should be reduced to 22-25% and another slab may be introduced raising the tax rate to maximum 30% for income level of Rs 25 lakh and above,” Preeti tells TOI.Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Raise basic exemption limit, standard deduction and NPS benefits for taxpayers “This reduction in tax will leave the government with some loss in the collection of direct tax revenue, at the same time leaving the individuals with more disposable income in their hands. This would also lead to more spending in the economy which will bring more indirect tax collection for the government,” she adds.Surabhi Marwah, Tax Partner, EY India is of the view that the basic exemption should be raised to Rs 5 lakh. She also advocates reducing the income tax rates in order to provide more disposable income in the hands of taxpayers.Kuldip Kumar, Partner at Mainstay Tax Advisors says that the number of slabs should be brought down under the new regime. “Currently there are 7 tax slabs under the new regime. These need to be rationalized to 3 or 4 at the most. The government has all the data on income brackets and the respective number of taxpayers falling therein and taxes paid. Changes should be made in such a way that tax burden reduces on the lower and middle income group tax payers,” he tells TOI.There were significant changes introduced in personal tax for individuals opting for new personal tax regime in the Budget 2023 like surcharge rate was brought down from 37% to 25% for individuals having taxable income more than Rs 5 crores, raising of the basic exemption limit by Rs 50,000, 100% tax rebate on income up to Rs 7 lakh. Accordingly, the government provided benefits for low-income level as well as high income level individuals.Currently, the income tax rates and slabs for the new income tax regime are:The eligibility limit for rebate is Rs 7 lakh, which means a tax rebate of up to Rs 25,000. There is a marginal relief for individuals whose net taxable income exceeds Rs 7 lakh and the incremental income tax liability is higher than incremental income above Rs 7 lakh.Also Read | Income Tax Expectations Budget 2024: What can the salaried, individual taxpayers expect?

The news of his resignation, believed to have been submitted to the President some time back, comes amid the controversy over IAS probationer Puja Khedkar 's selection to the civil services based on forged identity, which had on Friday led UPSC to file a police complaint against her.Govt sources, however, told TOI that Soni's resignation was not linked in any way to the Khedkar episode. ""The resignation was submitted almost a month ago, well before the IAS probationer's selection became a matter of probe,"" an officer told TOI.There is no clarity on whether govt has taken any call yet on accepting Soni's resignation. A source indicated that govt may be mulling over a suitable replacement before relieving Soni.Soni, who had joined UPSC as a member in 2017 and took over as its chairman last year, is said to be keen to step down to devote more time to ""socio-religious"" activities. Reports indicated that he wants to give his undivided time to serving the Anoopam Mission, a non-profit organization linked to the Swaminarayan sect that he is deeply involved with. The resignation is also said to have mentioned health reasons, according to a source.Soni, an academician considered close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, became the vice-chancellor of his alma mater Maharaja Sayajirao University, Baroda, in 2005. Only 40 years then, he was the youngest ever vice-chancellor in India. Later from 2009 to 2015, Soni was vice-chancellor of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Open University, Gujarat for two terms.Controversies rocked his tenure at MSU with the biggest being the infamous ""obscenity row"" of 2007 when objections were raised against a student's artworks, alleging they hurt religious sentiments. Soni suspended a professor for not abiding by his directives to close the exhibition.Though a governor-appointed committee recommended Panikkar's suspension be withdrawn with a mild reprimand, its report was not accepted.Instead, based on a departmental inquiry headed by a retired district judge, Panikkar was permanently suspended and his retirement benefits withheld.Soni's tenure also witnessed controversies over appointments of six officers in a non-quorum meeting and admission of a student from a private college into the grant-in-aid Faculty of Technology and Engineering (FTE).UPSC had on Friday filed an FIR with the Delhi Police against Puja Khedkar for having fraudulently availed of attempts at the Civil Services Exam (CSE) beyond the permissible limit by faking her identity.","UPSC chairman Manoj Soni has tendered his resignation barely a year into his six-year tenure.

It's worth push for opportunities outside Formula 1: Jehan Daruvala,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/racing/top-stories/its-worth-push-for-opportunities-outside-formula-1-jehan-daruvala/articleshow/111907344.cms,"NEW DELHI: Mumbaikar Jehan Daruvala , who competed in Formula 2 for four seasons has transitioned to Formula E after conciliating with the fact that his dream of reaching Formula 1 may never materialize.Despite a less-than-stellar start in the all-electric racing series and languishing at the bottom of the standings, Daruvala, 25, remains committed to the highly competitive championship, expressing satisfaction with the opportunities Formula E presents and looking at other options like Indycar if necessary.Daruvala's extended stint in Formula 2, the feeder series to Formula 1, saw him accumulate four wins and 18 podium finishes but ultimately fell short of securing a place in Formula 1.Questions arose about his lengthy and financially draining dedication to a junior series, especially after his departure from the Red Bull junior driver program.However, he holds no regrets about those years. The racer admits that his accomplishments weren’t enough in the rigorous environment, as he watched former teammates like Lando Norris and Yuki Tsunoda ascend to Formula 1.Representing Maserati in Formula E, Daruvala acknowledges a rocky beginning to his career in the electric racing series but remains optimistic. He intends to continue with Formula E next season and beyond, emphasizing the competitive nature of the championship.“Honestly, Formula E is probably the most competitive championship I've been on in terms of teams and even drivers. The level on Formula E is probably as good as Formula 1.""I'm happy where I am. I'm driving against the best guys in the world so I have no complaints,” Daruvala told PTI on the sidelines of season-ending London E-Prix.“Times are changing. There are also more opportunities outside of F1. Sometimes it's worth pushing on. I spent enough years in Formula 2 trying to go to F1 , but then when I realised that it wasn't possible, I looked somewhere else.""The realisation of not making Formula 1 dawned upon him when Red Bull released him from their junior driver program. He continued to chase his dream on his own but eventually settled for Formula E.“In the end, it just depends on each person. I think the biggest story is that there are more options in professional racing apart from F1. And they are all equally fun and enjoyable as well.“I mean, I'm not really looking back at those years anymore. I didn't win Formula 2 (title), so yeah, I don't have any regrets about it.""I feel I'm good enough to be in F1 but I didn't win in F2 so I have no regrets,” said Daruvala, who found it tough to move on from his childhood target but eventually turned the corner.After a difficult debut in Formula E, does he expect to get a seat for next year?“Honestly, for now I don't know. I would like to stay in Formula E but if not there's always other options. It's still only July so there's a long time. If I am not in Formula E, I would like to explore Indycar in the US.”How does he look back on the season when he had to unlearn a few things from his time in Formula 2?“I've had fun this year but it's been difficult especially managing the energy in the races.

HYDERABAD: A flourishing IT industry , coupled with a thick concentration of high net worth individuals (HNIs), has put Hyderabad on the hit list of cyber criminals, with Telangana accounting for the highest 15% share of malware attacks reported from across the country in 2023, a report says.A bevy of attackers worm their way into systems to make the state the geographical hotspot for such strikes, from the rookie OTP fraudsters of Jharkhand cyber-crime den Jamtara to skilled malware attackers working out of plush offices.According to the latest India Cyber Threat Report, Telangana was closely followed by Tamil Nadu with 14% of such attacks overall. Among cities, Hyderabad stood third on the dreaded list, behind Surat and Bengaluru.""These attacks have penetrated Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities as well, like Khammam and Adilabad, in Telangana. The server of a mid-sized IT company in a Tier 2 city was recently compromised after criminals gained access to the laptop of an employee working remotely,"" said the vice-president of a cyber security company that has handled several high-profile cases.According to him, Telangana could well top the list in 2024 with a slew of cyber crimes reported in the last six months. ""We have already had 55 attacks so far this year on IT majors, pharma companies, large banks and manufacturing companies' data centres in Hyderabad. There have been attacks targeting specific companies to steal intellectual properties. The attackers are focused on large companies with a database of thousands of people,"" the cybersecurity expert explained.While the semi-skilled bunch of cyber criminals operating from Jharkhand and UP target individuals from Telangana, specifically Hyderabad, the rest of the state has also turned fertile ground for sophisticated cyber criminals using malware as well, according to other experts.","Telangana accounts for the highest 15% share of malware attacks reported from across the country in 2023, a report says.

And I did not see tangible evidence out of that visit that it was deepening; I didn't see deliverables in that space,"" Sullivan said.How concerned were you when PM Modi met Russian President Putin, essentially at the same time that US President Joe Biden was hosting the NATO leaders in Washington, he was asked.""Don't you think the bear hug was significant then?"" he was asked. ""Well, Modi has a certain way of greeting world leaders.

Like many Indian athletes, Sarvesh too has spent countless hours of his life for just one goal - to be an Olympian and to win a medal for the country.The journey of this small-town athlete from Deogaon village of Nashik district in Maharashtra is nothing but incredible.As a young and aspiring kid, Sarvesh found a mentor in Raosaheb Jadhav , a physical education teacher at his school - DR Bhosale Madhyamik Vidhyalaya in Deogaon. Looking at his jumping skills, Jadhav introduced Sarvesh to high jump, but the mat required for landing during practice and at an event was missing. Like many Taluka-level athletes, Sarvesh started high jump with the Scissors style, and it took some years for him to shift to the result-oriented Fosbury mode.His shift to the Fosbury style of jumping was possible only after school authorities and his father Anil Kushare prepared a makeshift mat made from the waste from Corn with some cotton and unused clothes. Some agricultural waste too was used.In a chat with TOI, Jadhav explained the initial days of struggle. He said, ""To achieve success in high jump, Fosbury style must be followed. Since the requisite mat was not available, I and Sarvesh's father tried to find out ways to prepare a similar mat and after some research we achieved the desired result.""Jadhav added, ""The second challenge was to convert Sarvesh from the Scissors to Fosbury style. Since Sarvesh was getting results in Scissors style he was hesitant and a bit frightened. Then I gave him a practical display of landing and slowly he mastered Fosbury. Finally in 2013 Sarvesh won his first national medal, a silver, at the school nationals at Etawah.""Speaking with TOI from Poland, where he is camping with the Indian contingent, Sarvesh said, ""After I won my first national medal, Jadhav sir told me that this was just the first step as you need to bring medals for India and become an Olympic medalist. And I started living a dream of qualifying for the Olympics.""In 2016 Sarvesh joined the Army on the insistence of Jadhav. After being rejected twice by the Army, he was reluctant but with his consistent performance at the national level and the push that Jadhav gave, Sarvesh got himself enrolled. With better facilities and salary Sarvesh started his journey as a professional athlete.Jadhav said, ""From the savings of his salary at the Army, Sarvesh bought his first professional high jump spikes (shoes). The proper jumping spikes are not available in India. Now that he has all the facilities, Sarvesh is just a step away from achieving the unthinkable at the Paris Games.""The Asian Games silver medalist and reigning national champion, Sarvesh's personal best is 2.27m which he achieved during the 2022 Nationals in Gujarat. Jadhav feels Sarvesh has a realistic chance to create history in Paris. He explained, ""On June 29 at Panchkula, Sarvesh took a leap of 2.25m with a 15-20cms gap between his chest and bar. If we add that 15cms to his jump of 2.25m then he can cross 2.40m and it will be a sure shot medal.""Jadhav said, ""At Paris, Sarvesh will get similar weather conditions as Panchkula. If he is in his best frame, then history can be scripted.""","Sarvesh Kushare is the first Indian ever to qualify for the high jump event in Olympics.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

power outages

Accidents add to the toll

In the aftermath of the Hurricane Beryl 's landfall, nearly 3 million homes and businesses in Texas were left without electricity, and blackouts persisted for days or even longer in some cases. Hospitals saw a rise in heat-related illnesses as residents struggled without air conditioning. Almost two weeks later, the number of storm-related fatalities in Texas has reached at least 23.It wasn't until last week that most affected areas had their power restored, following more than a week of extensive outages.The sluggish response in the Houston region put CenterPoint Energy, the area's electric utility, under increasing criticism and raised questions about its level of preparedness for such events, news agency AP reported.The prolonged power outages have placed Houston's electric provider, CenterPoint Energy, under scrutiny for its preparedness and response. While most power has been restored, the true human toll of the storm may not be known for weeks or even years. Initially, deaths were caused by falling trees and drowning in floodwaters. As the days passed, heat-related deaths became more prevalent, especially in Harris County, where half of the storm-related deaths were due to heat.Experts stress the importance of understanding the full impact of the storm to better prepare for future disasters. Lara Anton, a spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services, mentioned that a preliminary count of storm-related deaths might be available by the end of July. The department relies on death certificates and additional information to identify storm-related fatalities.The initial deaths caused by the storm were a result of falling trees and drowning incidents when vehicles were submerged in floodwaters. In the aftermath of the storm, additional deaths occurred due to accidents while cutting damaged tree limbs and heat-related causes.According to the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences, half of the deaths in Harris County, which includes Houston, were attributed to the extreme heat following the storm.","The number of storm-related fatalities in Texas has reached at least 23.

The country's fragile political situation could also derail the recovery,"" the report added.With discussions about a potential ban on Imran Khan's party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf, BMI warned of possible widespread protests that could impact the economy.""While Pakistan's establishment parties were successful in creating a new coalition government following the February election, the strong electoral performance of independent candidates backed by jailed opposition leader Imran Khan suggests that there is significant dissatisfaction with the current political elite. Another round of protests in urban areas could disrupt economic activity,"" the BMI report stated.Additionally, the report highlights that while Pakistani policy makers are likely to miss ambitious budget targets, they might still manage to narrow the deficit.","Business Monitor International (BMI), a part of the Fitch Group, has reported that opposition leader Imran Khan is unlikely to be released from jail in the near future. Despite successful legal appeals, BMI predicts he will remain imprisoned. BMI emphasizes that it expects the government to push through IMF- mandated fiscal reforms.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111902907,imgsize-400325,width-400,resizemode-4/111902907.jpg"
Hard to implement IMF deal as political pressure surges in Pakistan: Experts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/hard-to-implement-imf-deal-as-political-pressure-surges-in-pakistan-experts/articleshow/111900333.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The current fiscal year's tax-laden budget and the Supreme Court's ruling on reserved seats have shifted the focus of politics to the economy , further posing doubts over Pakistan 's ability to meet the new International Monetary Fund (IMF) conditions for a $7 billion loan, reported Dawn.A senior researcher said, ""This is crucial to determining if the government can meet the conditions for a USD 7 billion IMF loan agreement.Nonetheless, I am confident the government will sign the deal at any cost.""According to the analysts, the government is seeking China's help to restructure its substantial $28 billion debt.However, sources have suggested that China is unlikely to restructure these loans, fearing that other nations, like Sri Lanka, may also seek debt restructuring from Beijing.Bankers and analysts agreed that the country has been facing significant challenges, with political pressure mounting to provide relief to the public, Dawn reported.""The government has failed to offer any relief, instead exacerbating the situation by repeatedly increasing fuel and electricity prices,"" a senior banker said, noting that only banks and the equity market are enjoying the ""worst economy,"" recording historic profits.On the contrary, sectors like textiles are calling for tax reductions and price controls. Exporters are also dissatisfied with the new taxes on their income.The annual inflation rate for FY24 stood at 23.4%, leaving the real interest rate negative by three per cent.""How can we expect any big cut in the interest rate in the future to stimulate the economy?"" the banker questioned.The sources said that the IMF has asked the State Bank to maintain fiscal discipline, implying no substantial relief in interest rates soon.The high cost of doing business has already led to economic contraction in FY23, with a mere 2.4 per cent growth in FY24.""If the political situation remains unstable, significant growth in FY25 is unlikely, which will increase unemployment and deepen political uncertainties,"" noted an analyst. The IMF projects 3.5% growth for FY25, while Fitch Ratings estimates 3.2%.Faisal Mamsa, CEO of Tresmark, showed optimism and said that the IMF deal will unlock additional funding sources, stabilise the rupee and bolster foreign exchange reserves.However, he expressed concerns about the political and social challenges in the country, which could complicate the successful implementation of IMF conditions, as reported by Dawn.""Moody's points out that Pakistan has historically struggled with implementing the structural reforms required by IMF programmes, which casts doubt on the current deal's effectiveness,"" he said.Despite campaigns for deals with Saudi Arabia, UAE and China, no substantial progress has been made, nor has privatisation of any government entity gone through, Mamsa said, adding that the anti-poor budget may not be sustainable in the long term.","The current fiscal year's tax-laden budget and the Supreme Court's ruling on reserved seats have shifted the focus of politics to the economy.
