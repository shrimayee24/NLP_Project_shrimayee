slams lateral entry move, says it undermines quotas

NEW DELHI: In the biggest such exercise since lateral entry began in 2019, Union Public Service Commission ( UPSC ) has invited applications for 45 mid-level posts of director, joint secretary and deputy secretary in various ministries and departments as govt seeks more specialists. So far, 63 appointments have been made through lateral entry at these levels during the past five years, and currently 57 such officers are posted, govt told RS on August 8.Applications have been invited for 10 joint secretary posts, which include two each in finance and MeitY (electronics and IT) ministries, and one each in environment, steel, shipping, science and technology, renewable energy and home ministry.Considering the need to go for people with specialisation, the MeitY has invited applications for joint secretary for 'emerging technologies' and another for 'semiconductor and electronics'.The two joint secretaries in the finance ministry will be hired for FinTech, cyber security and investment.According to the notification, the applications for the posts will have to be submitted by Sept 17 and will be on contract basis for three years, extendable to five years depending upon performance. The vacancies for joint secretaries in the shipping and environment ministries have been advertised as the term of two such officers hired earlier through lateral entry is ending.The fresh notification has triggered a strong protest from the opposition, which accused govt of systematically undermining the reservation system that safeguards opportunities for marginalised communities and their ""rightful"" share in governance.In a post in Hindi on X, Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge said, ""BJP, which has ripped apart the Constitution, has made a double attack on reservation! Under a well-planned conspiracy, BJP is deliberately making such recruitments in jobs so that SC, ST, OBC classes can be kept away from reservation.""Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) neta Tejashwi Yadav slammed the move as a ""dirty joke"" on the reservation system and the Constitution drafted by B R Ambedkar. He said if these 45 posts were filled through the traditional civil services examination, nearly half of them would have been reserved for SC, ST, and OBC candidates.According to the UPSC notification, applications have been invited for 35 director and deputy secretary posts. These appointments will be for climate change and soil conservation, credit, natural farming, organic farming and water management in the agriculture ministry; commodity pricing in the consumer affairs department, insolvency and bankruptcy in the corporate affairs ministry, two in the education ministry to deal with education laws and technology to name a few.Applicants for the post of joint secretary need a minimum of 15 years of experience and must be in the age of 40-55 years. The gross salary will be approximately Rs 2.7 lakh per month. Similarly, director and deputy secretary candidates need a minimum of 10 and seven years of experience respectively. They must be in the age group of 35-45 years for director and 32-40 years for deputy secretaries.","UPSC has invited applications for 45 mid-level posts of director, joint secretary and deputy secretary in various ministries and departments.

US court: 26/11 accused Tahawwur Rana can be extradited to India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-court-26/11-accused-tahawwur-rana-can-be-extradited-to-india/articleshow/112599310.cms,"US judge: Rana said people of India deserved 26/11 attack

A US court has ruled that Pakistani-origin Canadian businessman Tahawwur Hussain Rana can be extradited to India, where is wanted for his involvement in the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks carried out by Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists.""The (India US Extradition) Treaty permits Rana's extradition,"" the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit said on Thursday.Ruling on an appeal filed by 63-year-old Rana, a panel of three judges affirmed the District Court in the Central District of California's denial of his habeas corpus petition challenging a magistrate judge's certification of him as ' extraditable ' to India.Rana, currently lodged in a jail in Los Angeles, faces charges for his role in the 26/11 Mumbai attack and is known to be associated with Pakistani-American LeT terrorist David Coleman Headley, one of the main conspirators of the attacks.Writing the opinion for the bench that ruled that Tahawwur Hussain Rana can be extradited to India, judge Milan Smith said ""India provided sufficient competent evidence"" to support the initial order of a magistrate judge's ""finding of probable cause that Rana committed the charged crimes"" to allow the extradition.Rana, a Canadian citizen living in Chicago, was arrested in the US in 2009 for plotting to bomb a Danish newspaper, 'Jyllands-Posten', that published a controversial image of Prophet Mohammed.He faced three main charges in a Chicago federal court relating to his involvement in the Danish case, providing support to Lashkar, and conspiring for the Mumbai attacks.He was acquitted of the Mumbai attack charge, but convicted in the other two and sentenced to 14 years.The appeals court ruled that his acquittal in the Mumbai attack charge did not affect his extradition because in India he faces several different charges, including conspiracy, waging war, murder, terrorism, and forgery.Rana was released after seven years on compassionate grounds during the Covid-19 pandemic, following which India requested his extradition to face trial here, which the magistrate judge approved.Rana is a former Pakistan Army doctor who set up an immigration service after immigrating to Canada. The judgment mentioned Rana helping Headley get a five-year visa for India under the pretext of setting up a branch of his business there. Headley used the visa to help plot the Lashkar terror rampage by surveilling the Taj Hotel and other targets. Headley had informed Rana about the surveillance activities, the judgment said.Judge Smith also noted in the judgement that ""Rana commended the terrorists who carried out the attacks and stated that the people of India 'deserved it'.""","Tahawwur Hussain Rana is wanted for his involvement in the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks carried out by Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists.

Addressing the third Global South Summit India hosted virtually on Saturday, Modi said terrorism, extremism and separatism continued to pose serious threats to societies.After having listened to participating leaders from over 120 countries, Modi proposed a 'Global Development Compact ' that will be ""human-centric, multi-dimensional"" and, amid concerns over Chinese lending practices, not put needy countries under the burden of debt in the name of development finance.It will contribute in balanced and sustainable development of the partner countries, said Modi.""Under this 'Development Compact', we will focus on trade for development, capacity building for sustainable growth, technology sharing, project specific concessional finance and grants. To boost trade promotion activities, India will launch a special fund of $2.5 million,"" he said.Describing concerns about conflicts as a serious issue, Modi said solutions to these will depend on just and inclusive global governance, such institutions whose priorities give preference to the Global South, where developed countries fulfil their responsibilities and take steps to reduce the gap between Global North and South.The PM said earlier in his opening remarks that the technology divide and technology-related new economic and social challenges were also emerging. Looking to drive home India's point about the need for reforms of the UNSC and other global and financial institutions, Modi also said these had failed to meet the challenges of this century.India is committed to sharing its experiences, its capabilities with countries of Global South and wants to promote mutual trade, inclusive growth, progress of Sustainable Development Goals, and women-led development, he said.""In recent years, our mutual cooperation has been promoted by infrastructure, digital and energy connectivity. Let's learn from one another's experiences, share our capabilities, together transform our resolutions into success. Let us join together to get recognition for the two-third of humanity,"" said Modi, calling Global South unity the need of the hour.

Luckily her cries for help reached colleagues in adjacent rooms and they quickly gathered after which the assaulter tried to run away but was eventually nabbed. The dazed young woman, who suffered bruises, was taken to hospital and is now back in India where she is being counselled, said an official.Confirming the same, an AI spokesperson said: “We are deeply anguished by an unlawful incident of intrusion at a hotel, operated by a major international chain, that affected one of our crew members.We are providing all possible support to our colleague and their broader team, including professional counselling. Air India is also working with the local police to pursue the matter to the fullest extent of the law, and with the hotel management to ensure such incidents are not repeated.”The airline added that it “accords foremost priority to the safety, security and wellbeing of our crew and staff members” and requested “the privacy of those involved is respected.”The incident happened post shortly after midnight at Radisson Hotel London Heathrow. That night crew member of multiple AI flights were at the property. “The crew member was sleeping when an intruder attacked her in her room around 1.30 am. Startled, she woke up and screamed for help. He attacked her with a clothes hanger and dragged her on the floor as she tried to escape towards the door,” said sources.Her colleagues immediately came to her rescue. “She was badly bruised and the intruder tried to escape. The police were called in and she was taken to a hospital. She could not fly back on duty and a friend from the crew stayed back with her,” sources add.The police are probing the attack. “The intruder was arrested. He might have been a homeless person who walked into the hotel and managed to enter the room. The lack of security in the hotel is shocking. Luckily the crew member’s friends came to her rescue quickly and save her just in time,” sources say.AI pilots stay in Central London and the cabin crew in hotels near Heathrow . This alleged attack took place just a day after an 11-year-old Australian girl was stabbed eight times while visiting Leicester Square as a tourist with her mother.“The law and order situation in some parts of Britain, including London, as of now requires everyone there to be alert. We avoid going out alone after late evening these days in London.

She learnt about something she was not supposed to, doc’s parents ‘told cops’

KOLKATA: Did the 31-year-old PGT doctor at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital know something she was not supposed to? Did she have to pay the price for knowing those ""secrets""? Was the rape and murder planned to silence her?These are some of the questions raised by her parents and colleagues , who have also been insisting that police volunteer Sanjoy Roy, the only person arrested so far, could be ""only a small fry or even a scapegoat and that real culprits are yet to be apprehended"".Details that police have so far pieced together from the deceased doctor's diary and from her parents indicated that she was under tremendous stress and work pressure the last few weeks.Being a second-year PGT doctor, she had already spent over a year at the government medical college and hospital. At such institutes, it is common for junior doctors to work 36 hours at a stretch. She wrote about the pressures in a diary.""We suspect it was not a simple case of rape and murder or that she was an accidental victim. She was targeted. How did the civic volunteer know she was in the seminar hall alone at that time? He could be part of a plot hatched by big fish,"" said a colleague.Others hinted at a medicine ""racket"". ""There are murmurs of a possible drug siphoning racket in her department that she was trying to expose. There is a reason for us to suspect this as she was upright,"" said another colleague.Several colleagues said ""punishment overwork"" was an ""SOP"", perfected under the watch of the previous management of RG Kar, led by former principal Sandip Ghosh. For faculty members who did not toe Ghosh's line, it would mean transfer, and for MBBS students, failing in exams.Some RG Kar Medical College and Hospital insiders said the PG trainee doctor was extremely hard working and was focussed on her career. She always wanted to be a doctor and chose medicine, though she had also cracked engineering entrance exam as well. She was elated when she secured a PG seat at RG Kar to study chest medicine.On August 9, after being informed about their daughter’s death, the woman’s parents had told police that she had spoken to them about tremendous work pressure. From her diary, it was evident that some colleagues were dumping a lot of work on her.Before the case was transferred to CBI, the parents had reportedly told police their daughter might have learnt about something in the department that she was not supposed to. Colleagues and officials also pointed at numerous malpractices at the hospital and said anyone who dared stand up against the irregularities were “meted out some form of punishment”.",Colleagues and officials point at numerous malpractices at the hospital.

Maharashtra assembly polls likely in November,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maharashtra-assembly-polls-likely-in-november/articleshow/112596139.cms,"NEW DELHI: Election Commission will announce assembly polls in Maharashtra only after the J&K and Haryana election results on October 4, and is likely to tie them up with the Jharkhand polls.Sources told TOI that elections in Maharashtra and Jharkhand may be held in Nov and would be completed well before the term of current Maharashtra assembly expires on November 26.Chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar, while announcing the poll schedule for J&K and Haryana on Friday, said assembly elections in Maharashtra and Haryana - which were held together over the last few cycles - were delinked this time as the existing Haryana assembly's term was ending much earlier on Nov 3, 2024.Since J&K was a new addition to the list of assembly polls due in this part of the year, the options available to the EC were to either sync Haryana polls with J&K's or wait until the conclusion of J&K polls to announce elections in Haryana.However, as J&K polls had to be completed within the September 30 timeframe set by the Supreme Court and the earliest the poll process could start was August 20 (since Amarnath Yatra would be over a day before and the final revised rolls for the UT published by then), the EC did not have a decent window to hold the Haryana polls after the J&K polls. Also, the poll panel did not deem it proper to announce the Haryana polls separately while the poll process in J&K was still on.""The time between the completion of J&K poll process on October 6 and November 3, by when a new Haryana assembly should be in place, was not enough to accommodate the entire poll process, including the nomination procedure, campaign and polling. Besides in 2019, the Maharashtra assembly's term was only till November 9, unlike November 26 now, and much closer to the expiry date of the Haryana assembly on Nov 2, 2019, which is why the two states had gone to polls together,"" said an EC official.With the Jharkhand assembly's term ending on January 5, 2025, EC sources indicated it made sense in terms of logistics and expenditure to bring the Jharkhand polls forward and align them with the exercise in Maharashtra. ""Since the Delhi assembly polls are due only in Feb next year, EC appears more inclined to bring Jharkhand polls forward,"" the official said.",Election Commission will announce assembly polls in Maharashtra only after the J&K and Haryana election results on October 4.

Chief Advisor to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, Alapan Bandyopadhyay, outlined these measures during a press conference, amidst ongoing protests by doctors across the state in response to the alleged rape and murder of a medic at RG Kar hospital.The initiatives include designated retiring rooms and CCTV-monitored 'safe zones' in hospitals, medical colleges, hostels, and other establishments where women work night shifts.These locations will now be covered under the flagship programme 'Rattirer Sathi – Helpers of the Night', which involves volunteers.Furthermore, the state government plans to develop a mobile app with alarm features that women can download and use to communicate with local police stations in case of emergencies. Employees in both state and private establishments will be encouraged to form two-member women teams during night shifts to keep each other informed about their activities. Bandyopadhyay also mentioned, ""We have also recommended maintaining the right ratio of male and female security staff at workplaces.""In addition, ""breath analyser tests"" will be conducted at medical colleges and hospitals in the city and districts. Night police patrolling will be implemented at all medical colleges, hospitals, and women's hostels. ""Wherever possible, night duty may be avoided for women.

NEW DELHI: Government is unlikely to immediately step into the controversy created by the Hindenburg report as senior officials believe that the charges against Sebi chief Madhabi Puri Buch and her husband Dhaval, are ""untrue and malicious"" and are in response to the regulator 's notice to the short seller.They alleged that Hindenburg may also be trying to make a quick buck from the Indian markets through its latest action and the regulator and govt are keeping a close tab on how the developments unfold.Describing it as a fresh attempt to ""create a smokescreen"", a govt source suggested that this may be part of a larger attempt to discredit the regulator at a time when the Indian stock market is seeing a good run on the back of healthy macroeconomic fundamentals and strong growth prospects with clean corporate and bank balance sheets. The source alleged such actions were part of a pattern to hit Indian markets but argued that the markets were now strong and deep enough to withstand Hindenburg-type attacks.""There have been a series of regulatory actions to improve the overall functioning of the markets and the regulator itself has not shied away from cautioning investors, wherever it sees pressure building up,"" another official said, while listing out a host of measures taken by Sebi.

The ED describes the assets as proceeds of crime (POC) from a loan fraud in which ₹4,000 crore were allegedly diverted from a PSU bank .The fraud amount goes beyond Rs 11,300 crore if the interest is added.The financial assets seized include shares of listed companies, mutual funds, and fixed deposits, apart from Rs 55 lakh in cash, according to a press release shared by the ED.Cases have been booked against Jayaswal's sons, Abhijeet and Abhishekh, too.The probe revealed that the company not only used a web of 250 shell companies but also 20 charitable organisations for money laundering . The action was taken following a raid on the company's premises in Nagpur, Kolkata, and Vishakapattanam on Tuesday and Wednesday.Jayaswal headed the Abhijeet Group of companies, which was among the biggest beneficiaries of the UPA regime's controversial coal block allocation scheme. Abhijeet Group was also ranked among the country's top bank defaulters. The companies were sitting on huge debt, which ultimately turned into NPAs. CPL was one of the entities that had borrowed from Union Bank but ended up in a default. Known for his flamboyant lifestyle, Jayawal had also purchased a private jet which is now grounded at the Nagpur airport after a loan default.The CBI had registered a case against the CPL promoters for manipulating the project cost and other financial statements to avail loans. The loan amount was later diverted to purposes other than stated, leading to a loss of Rs 4,000 crore to Union Bank, says the press release. With interest, the amount comes to Rs 11,379 crore. Apart from CPL, two more bank frauds worth Rs 136 crore and Rs 180 crore were committed through two more group companies - Corporate Ispat Alloys Limited (CIAL) and Abhijeet Integrated Steel Limited (AISL) respectively, said the release.The ED investigation also revealed that the company's promoters had colluded and engaged in booking fictitious transactions in the company's books of accounts as well as those of its related entities. The search revealed that the Abhijeet Group had created a web of 250 shell companies, which were used for layering, integration, and utilisation of the proceeds of crime. The shell companies were also used to introduce share premium in the accounts and inflate the balance sheet. The fudging of accounts helped the company avail fresh bank loans.A network of 20 charitable institutions was identified, which were used as conduits for the proceeds of crime. The funds were also parked in immovable properties, apart from shares and mutual funds, the release said.Jayaswal shot into the limelight over a decade ago after the coal allocation scam came to the fore. The Abhijeet Group had been allotted a number of coal blocks. For CPL, the company had plans to set up a power plant at Latehar in Jharkhand. However, the Abhijeet Group began defaulting in repaying loans after the plans of CPL and other companies were held up after the coal blocks were wrested back from the beneficiaries.

Trial run of empty wagon at Hubballi rail track successful

The first trial run of empty coal wagons took place successfully on the restored railway track between Sonalim and Dudhsagar in the Braganza Ghat section, four days after a derailment incident. Passenger train services are scheduled to resume after ensuring all safety checks and obtaining the necessary approvals from the South Western Railway's technical and engineering departments.

Bengaluru: BMRCL has commenced laying tracks on the Metro viaduct constructed between Saraswathinagar and Doddnekkundi along the Outer Ring Road. This is a significant development in the construction of 19-km elevated line between Silk Board and K R Pura under phase IIA.BMRCL officials said a 2.5 km stretch has been taken up for track laying in the first stage, and the works started last week.A 4.4-km stretch from Kadubeesanahalli to Iblur will be handed over for track laying works in the next stage.BMRCL also approached the Railways for approval to erect spans across the operational rail tracks at Doddanekkundi. “We have started the fabrication of a steel girder. After getting necessary safety clearance from the Railway, we will launch a 65-metre steel composite girder across the track,” an official said. Another steel girder will be launched near Benniganahalli to connect the line with Baiyappanahalli depot.Regarding the hurdles faced in the construction at Iblur, another official said, “We are in talks with authorities to facilitate the Metro works by shifting the gas pipeline of GAIL. At Iblur, the Blue Line and phase III A line will interchange. We are proposing to build a three-storey building to generate commercial revenue by renting out space for offices.”The construction on the entire stretch is expected to be completed by March 2025.","Kadapa MP YS Avinash Reddy, along with Tirupati MP M Gurumoorthy, met union railways minister Ashwini Vaishnaw.

Excerpts from an interaction...

What are your thoughts now looking at the coverage of your medal wins?

Manu:

When you're shooting, do you ever think of something like this happening when you get back home?

Manu:

Jaspal, what did you tell her about your days as a shooter when you were hero worshipped after the

Asian Games

?

Jaspal:

Manu, we read somewhere that you have Maya Angelou's 'And Still I Rise' tattooed…

Manu:

How did it occur to you to get that done?

Manu:

What is the single biggest lesson that you learnt in Paris and what will it take to take you to gold in LA 2028?

Manu:

You may have read about what Prakash Padukone has said about athletes underachieving, there's been some controversy…

Jaspal:

After getting your medal, you were quoting the Gita. We believe you also read Mark Manson's 'The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck'…

Manu:

Are you a passionate reader?

Manu:

Jaspal:

Manu (interrupts):

Does music help you focus?

Manu:

So, sad songs for sad moments?

Manu:

How long do these feelings stay with you?

Manu:

Jaspal:

Can you tell us about your emotions in all the three events in the Olympics?

Manu:

Jaspal:

Shooting is not considered as a physical sport. How much emphasis do you put in physical fitness?

Manu:

Jaspal:

Manu:

What do you take from the Vinesh Phogat's journey - coming from protests to this winning position in the Olympics?

Manu:

Why didn't sportspeople stand up for them when they were protesting?

Manu:

With your progress what changes do you see in your native Haryana now?

Manu:

In the old days, the coach used to be like a command-and-control person. But now, it's a lot more give-and-take between the coach and the athlete…

Jaspal:

Manu:

We saw Turkish shooter

Yusuf Dikec

who shot without any gear on...

Jaspal:

Did you look at the memes on Dikec?

Manu:

Jaspal:

Manu:

Earlier, shooting was a very quiet sport. After rule changes, even loud music is played when shooters are in action. How do you adjust?

Manu:

In a sport where margins are so thin, how do you champions get themselves in the zone on the day that matters, especially on the Olympic stage?

Manu:

Do you have any techniques for honing the mental side of your game? Are these training methods secret?

Jaspal:

What do you do for mind training?

Manu:

India won a lot of bronze this time. To win silver, it's said you have to lose the gold, but for a bronze, you have to fight for the medal separately …

Manu:

At the Olympics, there was very little difference between bronze and a silver…

Manu:

What will you do to get gold in LA?

'VOWED THAT MY DAUGHTER WOULD MAKE HISTORY'

""No, no, wait, wait."" Manu Bhaker stops Jaspal Rana in mid-sentence. It is normal, the interruption. No one minds really. If anything, it sums up best the relationship between the two, oscillating between the once ugly - after the debacle in Tokyo three years ago - to the good-natured banter that marked the double bronze high of Paris this past fortnight.Jaspal is, if you like, the Bela Karolyi to Manu's Nadia Comaneci. Sometimes father figure, most times back-slapping pal, full-time coach. Yet, this time when Manu interrupts him, she has something to say that is her own mind, not just a coaching mantra, however well-meant.Manu Bhaker didn't need to pick up a gun. Her easy, natural charm is disarming enough. Because when she talks, we are literally eating out of her hand, hanging on to every word, eager to find some elbow room in their private jokes. But with this interruption, Manu Bhaker, is thoughtful, perceptive, telling us how picking up the gun can bring about change in patriarchal and conservative mindsets in native Haryana, and much of India.""I think one event can bring about some change, but if you want to see bigger change, it has to be persistent,"" said the double Olympic bronze winner, somewhere fully aware that her own life has changed with that one last pull of the hair-trigger at the Chateauroux Shooting Centre, some 300km south of Paris, where they fed a goat tethered nearby each day back from the range, just to beat off boredom.""It takes a lot of time to see significant changes in society. Although we have seen over a period of time how India has changed, we need something to be very persistent in the society and only then we'll be able to see significant changes,"" she held forth, as everyone in the crowded hall nodded.Manu Bhaker didn't need to pick up a gun. But now that she has, we, a nation, are eternally thankful.I did not get to see the newspapers at all. But this is so heartwarming. It feels so good. I mean almost the entire page is dedicated to me. Thank you so much for this.When we are in the field of play, it's all about nervousness. So, performance was good although silver was possible. The journey from Tokyo to here has been full of ups and downs. Training and preparation were very good but there was a lot of nervousness on match day.She doesn't know anything about my days. This generation is ahead in terms of information and technology. They are way ahead of the 1990s and 2000s. Now everything is on the computer.I know (blushes). I didn't know whose it was, but now it's mine. I got it in Jan 2022. Now, only when people tell me that I have the tattoo, then I'm like, 'Oh, I have that tattoo!'After Tokyo Olympics, I was trying to move on, but it was getting difficult with each passing day. So, I was like, 'You know what? I'll get a tattoo'. The tattoo reminded me that I had to move on. I really love this tattoo and whenever people remind me of it, it just clicks in my head.Tokyo indeed taught me many things. Other than luck, I think it's just that how you build yourself during the training days, how you train, in what conditions you are able to sustain yourself. Of course, how you are as a human being also matters a lot. Olympics is about the day.There will always be controversy. It's about how you think. We also had a lot of difficulties. We also have a lot of problems, but we did not bypass them. We went through it. I knew that I would not be allowed in the Olympics to sit behind her. So, we started training for it. In all the trials, I was sitting at the back. Sometimes the problem makes you stronger.I think that was a long time back.I do have books with me. I always have something or the other to read. We are not allowed to carry phones. During flights and traveling, if I'm not sleeping, then I'll probably read or eat. So that's that. I really like Usain Bolt's book ('Faster Than Lightning'). But during the Olympics, we had a hectic training programme. It was like if you gave me 10 minutes, I would have probably fallen asleep.We went to meet the ambassador, and she got the Gita from there also. I think maybe some limited edition.He was talking about the book, and he was like, this is such a good book. I was like, 'are you gifting it to me?' Books will always be with me. And I mean flowers will last for hours or 2-3 days. But books always stay.Yes, I am a big music listener. Even if I'm driving, I need music. Otherwise, I won't be able to drive with patience. Same goes with the sports. Music calms me down.It depends how I want to feel. Sometimes I play emotional music and sad music like 'Maula mere lele meri jaan.' If I want to feel sad, then I'll feel sad and play sad music.If I feel sad about something, I will solve it. I will cry over it, I will solve it and then I'll put it in the past. I do not like to carry it with me for future events or in daily life.There's no time for this. Like the first medal, there were too many interviews and all. Next morning she had to be on the range by 7.I think this time around we put in equal amount of effort in all three events. We were training for 10m, we were training for mixed doubles, and training for 25m equally well. The workouts, the meditation and everything. I was always aware that I'll be shooting in three events.If you see her scores, I'm happier with the third event (25 metre pistol where she missed the bronze). It's about the day, the day decides.I'll give you an example. If you are writing an exam, you have to be very well prepared and you have to manage the time also. You practice that. And it's like you have to practice to be able to stand for a longer period of time. You have to practice to sustain for a longer period of time. Because in a sport such as shooting, we do not have major injuries, but we do have minor injuries. And minor injuries can affect your career badly. There was a scapula injury I was struggling with last year. And then we have elbow, knees, lower back injuries. We also have neck injuries. To maintain our posture and to be able to deliver for a longer period of time, you have to be fit.You need more strength to stand in one place for two hours than walking for two hours. They need to stand still till the last shot. So, you can imagine the kind of fitness they need.Physical health also affects your mental health. And I really believe that if you're physically fit, you will probably be more confident and feel mentally more stable.She has been a fighter. She had to struggle with many things. And even despite her previous journeys in the Olympics, she did not give up. She is not a kind of person who will give up on anything. I do not know the technicalities of those situations, the protests and the current situation. I do not know the deeper version of it. But to me, I have huge respect for her. She's been like an elder sister to me. It's the spirit that she carries that 'I'll fight, I'll fight till the end'. I go by that.I think many people did stand up. It also depends on person to person if they want to be engaged in something. We have back-to-back competitions and there's something happening in our lives also. I do not have phones with me. I do not carry anything. I do not get time to read newspapers and all. If something is going on, I'll be the last person to know.Earlier, sports was a kind of taboo, but I see that changing. Many parents are supportive of their daughters and their careers. But we have a long way to go. We cannot be like, 'Okay, one, two, three… parents are allowing their girls, and we have made a change.' Yes, there is a change, but we need to go even further.It's completely what she wants, and I have to mould myself around that - the training, the technique she has. It's her technique. I just work around her technique. Even my shopping style has changed because of her shopping. I spend more time in the ladies' section because she stays in the gent's floor for about five minutes. We need to protect them; we need to take care of a lot of things.(Laughs) What will I do in the gents section?It's a matter of practice. I shot 10-15 years without gear. But when you want to get better, you need these (equipment). Manu never used shooting glasses but I forced her to do it. We try to get the best technology because you are up against the best players. Every now and then somebody comes up and shoots without anything and becomes a winner and goes home a hero. But the point is when you fight, you need to be prepared.I'm aware. There were comparisons between the Korean shooter and the Turkish shooter, but that's how it is. The Turkish shooter is a natural. He is 52 and has had a long career. Every person has a style of shooting. Some people use caps, some use glasses, some earphones. Some use everything, some nothing. It's just a matter of how you get used to equipment. Earlier, like 30 years back, I don't know if shooters had access to this kind of technology.In 25m, they shoot with firearms, and gunpowder comes out. So, fire protection is required. You need to have earmuffs because after 50 you don't want to go deaf. We need every little protection provided.Plus 10m (air pistol event) doesn't require much protection.We have practiced every situation in training, everything that can happen during our matches. The atmosphere is different everywhere. During the trials before Paris, it was very quiet. We had no music. In international tournaments, sometimes the music is so loud or totally quiet.It's all in the mind. Your training talks during high-pressure situations. You have to work for it. Two months before the Olympics, we started training at exactly the same time of the qualification stage, the finals.It's not secret. If you are not able to see what people are doing, then it's a secret. Just like in journalism, you have to keep your eyes open.I read the (Bhagavad) Gita, usually. My physical fitness definitely helps me to be on my toes as well as be mentally fit. If anything bothers me, I talk to my mom, my dad, my brother. Even to (Jaspal) sir. I write journals. Meditate before bedtime. I read Gita before sleeping, it just stays with me. I have been reading the Gita since the last 7-8 years. Before that, my mother used to teach me, guide me, and keep mentioning the shlokas. For me, the ultimate one is focusing on your karma, not to think about the outcome.Yes, I've seen people not being happy with silver. But with a bronze they are kind of happy because they fought and they won. In the mixed team event, me and my partner Sarabjot actually fought for the medal. But yes, gold is gold, nothing like it.(Laughs) Yes, I see the headline here 'Manu misses silver' and then the report states 'Manu shot at 10.3, scored a 10.5'. So, there are very minor margins to win or to lose. In our sport, it's not him versus me or her versus me, it's more like how you as an individual are doing. That counts. Both medals are equally important. The second one was either you win third position or you lose. The first match was like, you have an opportunity to win the gold too. My scores were very good; however, I missed the silver by 0.1, the gold was also missed.It will be different, there will be the weight of expectation.That's fine. That's natural because that's what we train for. So, we will give our best and do better than this time.We have to push a little harder. With more pressure, there should be more effort. Experiment-wise, though, I don't think too much experimentation will succeed.The Tokyo chapter is an experience and will always be there with me. The experience will be there.What happened in Tokyo? (laughs)Yes, absolutely.Even I can, I will be 53, 52 (like Dikec) during the next Olympics.All of them shot brilliantly. If you see the skeet event, mixed team, Arjun Babuta, Sarabjot - all reached the final. So, we have several talented shooters. It's only about protecting them. How do we protect them? I think the authorities have to work on it… SAI, the federation, government, TOPS, everybody has to start working on it. Protecting a talent is a task.There will be a lean time for every sportsperson. It's during that time that you need to look after them. There is no talent protection in our country. Saurabh Chaudhary, you remember the name? What was Saurabh Chaudhary 's score in Tokyo? He was outstanding in Tokyo, just didn't win a medal. What did we do to protect him? Nothing.I mean, few songs of hers, yes, but it's like more like Karan Aujla, Diljit Dosanjh, Arijit Singh for me. And then the 1990s (looking at Jaspal).I take around like 2 hours in the gym every day. Every day, like five times a week. Or if my matches are going on, I'll work out every day. And the workout would be like, depending on the matches and all. So I will do my warm-up, then I'll do my rehab. Rehab for all the muscles and everything for injury prevention. Then I'll strengthen those small muscles for long-term injury prevention. And then I'll do the strengthening and then the cool down.She gave up the sugar two days back.Kal hi ice-cream khayi thi (I had ice-cream yesterday), samosas and all.But she's honest that way, that she doesn't cheat on exercise, training, eating and all.(I haven't been home yet, haven't eaten meals cooked by my mummy).""I always asked God for a daughter, and I vowed that if I had one, I would ensure she would do something that would go down in history,"" Manu's mother, Sumedha Bhaker told TOI. Manu's father, Ram Kishan, recounted that Manu was always a natural sportsperson. ""One day she'd be boxing, one day she'd be into karate. She used to be playing something or the other all the time."" Was it difficult to encourage their daughter's sporting interests in a conservative environment, TOI asked.""When Manu was still very young, I did the karva chauth fast. That day, I made my husband put his hand on my head and swear that he would let me move to a city with the children if we needed to. Whenever I did a fast, as a gift I always asked for something that would help the children,"" said Sumedha. ""I was determined to fulfill my vow.""She certainly did, and India owes her a debt of gratitude.","Manu Bhaker and coach Jaspal Rana tell TOI what it took to win a double. Bhaker: ""Shooting is not considered as a physical sport. How much emphasis do you put in physical fitness?"" Rana: ""It's a lot more give-and-take between the coach and the athlete""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112580375,imgsize-193600,width-400,resizemode-4/112580375.jpg"

KOLKATA: From New York City 's Times Square to Canada; from the UK to Germany, and Bangladesh, protests were held, and are being organized, across the world in a show of solidarity with those in Kolkata fighting for justice for the RG Kar rape-murder victim.Sayantan Das, who participated at the midnight protest at Times Square on Aug 14, said there were around 40 people who gathered in a show of solidarity with students and women in Bengal.""Some scientists and researchers of New York organized the protest and we carried leaflets and posters. There were many Indians who were nearby and they asked us about the incident. Finally, when we sang the National Anthem, they joined us,"" Das said.On Sunday, Los Angeles Indians will gather at Lake Hollywood Park at 11 am to protest in front of the Hollywood signage. Babli Chakraborty, an LA-based teacher who grew up in Kolkata, said, ""Some 250 Indians are expected to turn up. Earlier on, rape survivors never spoke because of shame. Now, it is crucial to raise our voices.""The Bengali community of Houston, including members of Houston Durgabari Society and Tagore Society of Houston, came out to protest the RG Kar incident. ""The fact that an educated working woman standing up to corruption was raped and murdered points to a complete systematic failure at medical institutions,"" said Rituparna Roy one of rally organisers.In Chicago, the Bengali community organised a protest-cum-vigil on Thursday.

English teacher Sukanya Chakraborty (36) from Kolkata started off the protest by deciding ""not to wish anyone a good evening"" and ending her speech with ""no mercy"". Debaschmidt Biswas, who organized the meet with Soumi Chakraborty and Sukanya Chakraborty, read out a poem by his mother on women's plight in her city. The meeting ended with a walk with candles in hand and demands of ""Justice for RG Kar, Justice for Kolkata"".Homemaker Amrita Roy joined her fellow warriors at Crown Point Shopping Centre in Leeds, UK on Aug 14. ""I am hurt and angry. We wore all-black attires and observed a minute’s silence before speaking about the issue. Not a single rapist should go unpunished. No one dare hush up the matter. I demand transparency in a fast-tracked probe,"" Roy said.Doctors from Bengal and other parts of India working in the UK organized a protest in Manchester on Wednesday, joined by other Indians who participated in a candlelight march. ""This is a shocking incident,"" said Arunava Dhar, a neonatologist at Cambridge, an alumnus of RG Kar. Protests spread to other areas, including London 's Trinity Church, Princes Street in Edinburgh, and the main square of Poland's Krakow.

Bangladesh: Dozens Of Hasina's Party Members Chased & Killed In Mob Attacks; 29 Bodies Found

Heavy rains in Brazil have led to a remarkable paleontological discovery : a 233 million-year-old dinosaur fossil . This significant find was made in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul , near the town of São João do Polêsine. The fossil, which is almost fully preserved, was unearthed next to a reservoir after torrential rains eroded parts of the fossil site.The dinosaur, believed to be a member of the Herrerasauridae family , roamed the Earth during the Triassic Period when all the continents were part of a single landmass known as Pangea, also often referred to as a ""super continent"".Herrerasaurids were among the earliest carnivorous dinosaurs, and this particular specimen is estimated to have been about 2.5 meters (8 feet) long. The discovery was made by a team led by Rodrigo Temp Müller , a paleontologist from the Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM).The site where the fossil was found has been a focus of paleontological research for about 20 years. The region is known for its rich deposits of Triassic fossils, which have provided valuable insights into the early evolution of dinosaurs . The recent heavy rains accelerated the erosion process, exposing the fossil that had been buried for millions of years. According to Müller, the fossil was initially thought to be just a few isolated bones, but further excavation revealed an almost complete skeleton.This discovery is particularly significant because it is one of the oldest dinosaur fossils ever found. The oldest known dinosaur fossils date back to around 231 million years ago, making this find potentially one of the earliest examples of dinosaur evolution. The fossil’s excellent preservation allows scientists to study its anatomical details, which could provide new insights into the characteristics and behaviors of early dinosaurs. Truly an exciting find!The Herrerasauridae family, to which this dinosaur belongs, includes some of the first known carnivorous dinosaurs. These dinosaurs were bipedal, much like the Tyrannosaurus Rex, meaning they walked on two legs, and had free hands with sharp claws for catching prey. The newly discovered fossil is expected to shed light on the evolutionary adaptations that allowed these early dinosaurs to thrive in their environment.The discovery has generated excitement in the scientific community, as it could help fill gaps in our understanding of dinosaur evolution. The fossil’s advanced age and preservation make it a unique and valuable addition to the fossil record, offering a rare glimpse into the past. Researchers are now working to carefully extract the fossil from the surrounding rock and conduct detailed analyses to determine whether it represents a new species of dinosaur.The region where the fossil was found has been subject to increasingly severe weather events, including the heavy rains that led to this discovery. In June 2024, the state of Rio Grande do Sul experienced three months’ worth of rain within just two weeks, causing widespread flooding and displacing over 500,000 people. While the rains have accelerated the erosion process, they also pose a threat to newly exposed fossils, which can be damaged or destroyed if not promptly rescued.The Federal University of Santa Maria and other research institutions are now focused on preserving the fossil and conducting further studies. The findings from this discovery are expected to be published in scientific journals, contributing to our knowledge of early dinosaur evolution and the conditions that shaped their development.For the unversed, dinosaurs were a diverse group of reptiles that dominated the Earth during the Mesozoic Era, which lasted from about 252 to 66 million years ago. They were some of the most successful and varied animals ever to have lived, ranging from the small, bird-like Velociraptor to the gigantic, long-necked Brachiosaurus. Paleontologists study dinosaur fossils to learn about their behavior, diet, and appearance. Fossilized bones, teeth, footprints, and even eggs have been found, offering insights into these ancient creatures. There were over 1,000 different species of dinosaurs identified so far, ranging from the plant-eating sauropods to the fierce carnivorous theropods, showcasing their incredible diversity.Did you like this article?

Land acquisition on for Cuncolim bypass project,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/land-acquisition-on-for-cuncolim-bypass-project/articleshow/112595982.cms,"Better connectivity

Panaji:

The Union ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) has begun the process of acquiring land for the Cuncolim bypass. Under the project, the highway will be four-laned from Uskinibandh to Bendordem.A notification has been issued stating that the land is being acquired for public purposes and any objection regarding that should be filed within 21 days with the special land acquisition officer of the Public Works Department (PWD).Last month, Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari had sanctioned Rs 310 crore for land acquisition for the Cuncolim bypass, spanning 8.3km. The stretch from Uskinibandh to Bendordem has become accident-prone due to the increasing vehicular flow, as per reports.“The bypass addresses the problems of congestion and accidents in Cuncolim, providing improved connectivity to tourist destinations in South Goa and Panaji,” Gadkari had said. “This development anticipates enhanced service levels, considerable socio-economic benefits, reduced vehicle operating cost, and decreased travel time.”After the highway widening is completed from Patradevi to Bambolim (barring the Porvorim corridor), the Siridao bypass, the new Zuari bridge, the Canacona bypass, and the stretch along Cuncolim are some roads that will need to be focused on.A four-lane highway expansion from Navelim to Cuncolim and a four-lane bypass from Mashem to Pollem in Canacona are the other stretches to be completed in the state.The work on the Navelim to Cuncolim stretch has been stuck with two factions asking for a shift in the alignment to protect their side of the houses.",The highway will be four-laned from Uskinibandh to Bendordem.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

Q: How much time should I be dedicating to career cushioning?

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Court documents reveal Plasencia's derogatory texts about Perry, including ""I wonder how much this moron will pay"" and ""Let’s find out,"" reported NYT.Ketamine, used increasingly for mental health treatments, was also abused recreationally. Perry had sought treatment for depression and anxiety, leading to addiction to intravenous ketamine. The autopsy report showed that Perry’s ketamine levels were equivalent to those used in general anesthesia.Erik Fleming, an acquaintance of Perry’s, has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute ketamine and distribution resulting in death. Dr Mark Chavez admitted to selling ketamine to Plasencia, while Kenneth Iwamasa, Perry’s assistant, injected him with ketamine.

UFO: ‘We are not alone’: Ex-defense official claims home invaded by ‘glowing green orbs’ in new UFO memoir,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/we-are-not-alone-ex-defense-official-claims-home-invaded-by-glowing-green-orbs-in-new-ufo-memoir/articleshow/112599615.cms,"In his newly released memoir 'Imminent: Inside the Pentagon's Hunt for UFOs', former senior defense official Luis Elizondo revealed that glowing green orbs , roughly the size of basketballs, mysteriously invaded his home. Elizondo, who spearheaded a top-secret Pentagon program investigating Unexplained Aerial Phenomena (UAPs), shared these unsettling experiences in a book that took a year to pass Department of Defense censorship.The memoir details his tenure at the Advanced Aerospace Weapons System Applications Program under the Defense Intelligence Agency and suggests ongoing government knowledge of UFOs dating back to the 1940s.Elizondo claims that his work at the Pentagon often spilled into his personal life. Over a period of seven years, his home in the DC area was allegedly visited by green, glowing orbs that appeared to be under intelligent control. These events were witnessed not only by Elizondo but also by his wife, their two daughters, and neighbors, who referred to the mysterious entities as “our friends from out of town.”“We can no longer stick our heads in the sand. We know we are not alone,” Elizondo says in his book.Elizondo's diverse background includes service in the Army in Afghanistan, involvement in counterterrorism operations, and work at Guantanamo Bay before being assigned to the UFO program. The extent of Pentagon knowledge and the secrecy surrounding it left him astonished.“I know that our US military takes very seriously their job of defending our nation, and I believe they will take the necessary actions to ensure our defense against all threats,” he told the Daily Beast after retiring.According to Elizondo, the Pentagon has been amassing a significant body of knowledge about UFOs since the 1950s, initially driven by the need to prevent the Soviet Union from gaining such information. “Whoever controlled such technology could control the world,” he writes. His program investigated Navy pilots’ encounters with unexplained aerial phenomena, capturing videos of mysterious craft performing seemingly impossible maneuvers. Three such videos, first reported by The New York Times, were later confirmed by the Pentagon in 2020 as authentic, though they did not confirm whether the craft involved alien intelligence.“The nonhuman intelligence controlling them presents, at best, a very serious national security issue, and at worst, the possibility of an existential threat to humanity,” Elizondo writes regarding the unknown spacecraft.Due to government censors, Elizondo was limited in what he could discuss in his memoir. However, he hinted that other secretive alien-hunting programs exist but have never been fully disclosed.Elizondo's program gained public attention in a unique way. Established by then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid in 2007, it received $22 million, discreetly inserted into other spending. Although the unit was officially shut down in 2012, Elizondo continued his work with the Navy until he resigned in 2017. In a letter to then-Defense Secretary James Mattis, Elizondo emphasized, “There remains a vital need to ascertain the capability and intent of these phenomena for the benefit of the armed forces and the nation.”Following his retirement, Elizondo became a prominent voice on UFO-related issues. He briefed his successors on the Pentagon’s crash retrieval program and named Harold E. Puthoff as the government’s chief scientist on alien matters for 50 years—a role that had remained unreported until the memoir. Puthoff, who holds a Stanford PhD, has also faced accusations of pseudoscience.Puthoff supported Elizondo's claims, stating, “He has briefed us on information that he obtained that appears to be firsthand data, and I have no reason to discount that. He certainly had clearances to get primary information.”Elizondo’s assertions about government knowledge extending back to the 1940s go beyond what official agencies have acknowledged. While the CIA has declassified many documents detailing its UFO investigations from that period, their findings are generally inconclusive.The Air Force’s Project Blue Book , which investigated 12,618 reported UFO sightings between 1947 and 1969, concluded, “There has been no evidence indicating that sightings categorized as ‘unidentified’ are extraterrestrial vehicles.”Despite such official statements, Elizondo remains convinced that extraterrestrial intelligence exists and poses significant implications for national security and humanity as a whole. His memoir seeks to shed light on his experiences and the broader scope of government knowledge on unexplained aerial phenomena.“We can no longer stick our heads in the sand. We know we are not alone,” he reiterates in his book, urging for greater public understanding and official disclosure of what he and others have encountered.","Former senior defense official Luis Elizondo claims that glowing green orbs invaded his home over a seven-year period.

No joke: The onion thinks print is the future of media,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/no-joke-the-onion-thinks-print-is-the-future-of-media/articleshow/112599674.cms,"The Onion: 'Mild-mannered reporter suddenly transforms into incredible unemployed man'

The Onion: 'Major shift in media landscape occurs every 6 seconds'

The Onion: 'Americans demand new form of media to bridge entertainment gap while looking from laptop to phone'

The funniest writers at The Onion shuffled through dozens of news stories at a meeting last week, trying to discern which headline would make readers laugh harder.""Next Up: 911 Operator Calmly Talks Woman Through Macarena,"" suggested one writer, as his co-workers cackled. Another: ""JD Vance Doubles Down on Controversial Criticism of Childless Children.""The headlines -- all 52 of them -- were completely fake, possible fodder for the satirical news site.But the jokesters behind those stories are also hard at work on a genuine experiment in the media business, one so counterintuitive that it sounds as if it could have been published in The Onion.This week, The Onion began distributing a print edition for the first time in more than a decade and will soon deliver it monthly to everyone who subscribes to its site. The move is a throwback to the publication's roots as a campus weekly in the late 1980s.But it is also emblematic of a growing trend in the media industry -- trying new ways to attract and retain digital subscribers .The Onion is no stranger to the difficulties that face the publishing business. Its headlines have tracked the tumult in the media industry over the past several years, even occasionally poking fun at itself:The print edition is part of a variety of perks that the company plans to offer online subscribers, who pay $5 a month, said Ben Collins, the CEO of The Onion's parent company,Global Tetrahedron . The company plans to offer invites to live events, access to The Onion's archive of physical papers and sponsorship of ambitious editorial projects, such as a video titled ""The Perfect One-Pot, Six-Pan, 10-Wok, 25-Baking-Sheet Dinner,"" Collins said.""Do you know how much 10 woks cost these days?"" he asked. ""It's not pretty.""The Onion hopes to begin turning a profit later this year with the help of those subscription add-ons, said Collins, whose company took over the publication in April.At the same time, The Onion is reducing its reliance on certain kinds of advertising. A month ago, it stopped running digital ads from the company Taboola, a purveyor of attention-grabbing links. Most of the ads in this month's print edition -- for Ashley Madison, WeWork and Chick-fil-A -- are fake, but there are some genuine promotions for The Onion. One of the ads: ""It's That Sweater You Clicked On Once. We Found a Way to Follow You Into Print Media, Too.""Over the past 10 years, The Onion has changed hands three times. It was bought by Spanish-language television company Univision, digital publisher G/O Media and, this year, Global Tetrahedron. Along the way, there have been layoffs, tense contract negotiations and even the sale of The Onion's sister site, The AV Club.But its 15 staff members are hoping the worst is behind them. Under the owner of Global Tetrahedron, Jeff Lawson, a co-founder of the tech company Twilio, the publication has enjoyed a relatively calm period.Lawson said he had started joking with friends about buying The Onion after Marc Benioff, the founder of Salesforce, bought Time magazine in 2018. In early 2024, Lawson was introduced to a group interested in buying The Onion, including Collins; Leila Brillson, a former TikTok executive; and Danielle Strle, a product development executive.""I said, 'I have $600 -- who wants to help me buy this?'"" Collins said. He said he was lucky to be introduced to Lawson, ""the only regular person in Silicon Valley.""Lawson said he hoped to own The Onion for the rest of his life. The business could be turned around, he said, if it focused first on satisfying its paying customers.Lawson said he hadn't discussed his purchase of The Onion with Elon Musk -- the Tesla CEO, who at one point discussed a bid for the site -- despite their shared love of satire.""Unbelievably, not all Silicon Valley people hang out in an evil mountainside lair,"" Lawson said.The Onion will hand out its new print edition next week at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago -- where The Onion is based -- though Collins joked that the publication was not credentialed to cover the event.The major influx of influential journalists will make it a perfect opportunity to debut the print edition, said Jordan LaFlure, The Onion's executive editor.LaFlure said he hoped the print newspaper would reach a younger generation of consumers who had already begun to show some affinity for analog substitutes of digital products.""I think for the same reason that 18-year-old kids are buying Taylor Swift on vinyl,"" LaFlure said, ""we can introduce those same kids to the notion that a print publication is a much richer way to consume media.""The staff doesn't seem to share that enthusiasm for all publications. One of the front-page headlines in The Onion this week: ""New York Times to Cease Publication.""",The Onion is distributing a print edition for the first time in more than a decade. The move is a throwback to the publication's roots as a campus weekly in the late 1980s.

But our supply chains have improved and prices are still too high.”Highlighting his support for Harris' initiatives regarding healthcare and pharmacy costs, Cuban said in a post, “And my favourite of course, did anyone else hear @VP say she was going to bring TRANSPARENCY to pharmacy and healthcare middlemen?

He emphasized her pro-business stance, quoting her speech: ""I will focus on cutting needless bureaucracy and unnecessary regulatory red tape .""Cuban further quoted Harris, underlining her commitment to fostering innovation , protecting consumers, and creating a stable business environment. He highlighted her pledge to bring together labour, small businesses, and major companies to invest in America, create jobs, achieve broad-based growth, and ensure America's continued leadership in the world.Earlier on Friday, Kamala Harris announced a federal ban on price gouging in the food industry at a campaign event. ""My plan will include new penalties for opportunistic companies that exploit crises and break the rules,"" she said.However, some economists warn that Harris's proposal could create new challenges, while Harris claimed her proposal will foster competition within the food industry.","Shark Tank judge, American businessman and investor Mark Cuban took to X to commend her real estate policies and proposal to ban price gouging.

These ads will be concentrated in crucial battleground states that are expected to play a pivotal role in determining the election's outcome.In addition to the television spots, the campaign is investing more than $200 million in digital advertising across popular streaming platforms such as Hulu, Roku, and YouTube. Notably, this figure does not encompass spending on social media or search services, indicating that additional funds may be allocated to those areas as the campaign progresses.Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump's campaign has so far reserved advertising time after Labour Day in only two states: Pennsylvania and Georgia. This information comes from data provided by the media tracking firm AdImpact, highlighting a disparity in advertising strategies between the two campaigns.Quentin Fulks and Rob Flaherty, deputy campaign managers for the Democratic candidates, outlined the specifics of their advertising approach in the memo. They stated that the television ads being reserved will include placements during high-viewership events to maximize exposure.""The television ads will include spots around high-viewership moments such as major sporting events and season premieres,"" the memo detailed.Furthermore, the campaign is making daytime reservations on Fox News Channel. The strategy behind this move is to reach a segment of conservative-leaning independents who previously supported former GOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley over Trump during the Republican presidential primary.Ad reservations are a strategic tool used by candidates and campaigns to secure advertising slots and lock in rates before prices escalate as election dates approach.

What are you talking about?""Jim Treacher, a Substacker, echoed the skepticism: ""'Day one.' We're supposed to vote for her because of the past four years, which we're supposed to pretend never happened.""Columnist Jon Gabriel criticised Harris’s approach, writing, ""You've spent three-and-a-half years raising prices.""Conservative writer Libby Emmons criticised Harris’s plan to institute price controls, stating, ""Kamala Harris wants to institute price controls across key areas like food and housing just like they do in socialist nations. And then she wants to make it harder for big corporations to create new jobs by destroying tax cuts, incentives for investment in the US.""Virginia Kruta, another conservative writer, warned of potential negative impacts on smaller businesses: ""If you run a small grocery store or own one house/building for rent, you're screwed and she doesn't care. If she puts a price control on larger corporate stores and landlords, they will be forced to charge less than the little guys, and the little guys will lose.""Strategist Yossi Gestetner noted the contradiction in Harris’s position, stating, ""You are VP now. Your day one was almost 4 years ago. You are simultaneously running as the current VP while running against the administration that you are VP of. Price Controls reduce incentives to produce which rescues supply which leaves more people with less. Genius.""Conservative commentator Paul Szypula argued that Harris is partially responsible for current economic issues: ""Kamala Harris has been Vice President for four years and has brought up prices 20% on average. Prices are high because inflation is high. Harris cast the vote to make it that way.""Finance and culture commentator Wall Street Silver criticised the policy's feasibility, stating, ""Price controls failed in the 1970s when Nixon tried them. Companies reduce production because they cannot make a profit at the govt ordered price. This results in shortages as companies respond to govt controls. Kamala is a socialist and will turn us into Venezuela.""Harris unveiled her economic plan during a speech in Raleigh, North Carolina, saying, ""When I am elected president, I will make it a top priority to bring down costs and increase economic security for all Americans. As president, I will take on the high costs that matter most to most Americans, like the cost of food."" She acknowledged the pandemic's impact on prices but added, ""Our supply chains have now improved and prices are still too high.""Harris concluded her speech by addressing business practices, saying, ""I know most businesses are creating jobs, contributing to our economy, and playing by the rules, but some are not, and that’s just not right, and we need to take action when that is the case.""","Vice President Kamala Harris promised to address rising prices on ""day one"" of her potential presidency.

'Monsoon brides': Extreme weather fuels Pakistan child marriages,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/monsoon-brides-extreme-weather-fuels-pakistan-child-marriages/articleshow/112579850.cms,"'I thought I would get lipstick'

'I want to study'

DADU: As monsoon rains were about to break over Pakistan , 14-year-old Shamila and her 13-year-old sister Amina were married off in exchange for money, a decision their parents made to help the family survive the threat of floods.""I was happy to hear I was getting married... I thought my life would become easier,"" Shamila told AFP after her wedding to a man twice her age in hope of a more prosperous life.""But I have nothing more. And with the rain, I fear I will have even less, if that is possible.""Pakistan's high rate of marriages for underage girls had been inching lower in recent years, but after unprecedented floods in 2022, rights workers warn such weddings are now on the rise due to climate-driven economic insecurity .The summer monsoon between July and September is vital for the livelihoods of millions of farmers and food security, but scientists say climate change is making them heavier and longer, raising the risk of landslides, floods and long-term crop damage.Many villages in the agricultural belt of Sindh have not recovered from the 2022 floods, which plunged a third of the country underwater, displaced millions and ruined harvests.""This has led to a new trend of ' monsoon brides ',"" said Mashooque Birhmani, the founder of the NGO Sujag Sansar, which works with religious scholars to combat child marriage.""Families will find any means of survival. The first and most obvious way is to give their daughters away in marriage in exchange for money.""Birhmani said since the 2022 floods, child marriage has spiked in villages in Dadu district, one of the worst-hit areas that for months resembled a lake.In Khan Mohammad Mallah village, where Shamila and Amina were married in a joint ceremony in June, 45 underage girls have become wives since the last monsoon -- 15 of them in May and June this year.""Before the 2022 rains, there was no such need to get girls married so young in our area,"" said village elder Mai Hajani, 65.""They would work on the land, make rope for wooden beds, the men would be busy with fishing and agriculture. There was always work to be done"".Parents told AFP that they hurried the marriage of their daughters to save them from poverty, usually in exchange for money.Shamila's mother-in-law, Bibi Sachal, said they gave 200,000 Pakistan Rupees ($720) to the young bride's parents -- a major sum in a region where most families survive on around one dollar a day.Najma Ali was initially swept up in the excitement of becoming a wife when she married at 14 in 2022 and began living with her in-laws, as is tradition in Pakistan.""My husband gave my parents 250,000 rupees for our wedding. But it was on loan (from a third party) that he has no way of paying back now,"" she said.""I thought I would get lipstick, makeup, clothes and crockery,"" she told AFP, cradling her six-month-old baby.""Now I am back home with a husband and a baby because we have nothing to eat.""Their village, which lies on the banks of a canal in the Main Nara Valley, is barren and there are no fish left in the polluted water -- its stench overwhelms the area.""We had lush rice fields where girls used to work,"" said Hakim Zaadi, 58, the village matron and Najma's mother.""They would grow many vegetables, which are all dead now because the water in the ground is poisonous. This has happened especially after 2022,"" she added.""The girls were not a burden on us before then. At the age girls used to get married, they now have five children, and they come back to live with their parents because their husbands are jobless.""Child marriages are common in parts of Pakistan, which has the sixth-highest number of girls married before the age of 18 in the world, according to government data published in December.The legal age for marriage varies from 16 to 18 in different regions, but the law is rarely enforced.Unicef has reported ""significant strides"" in reducing child marriage, but evidence shows that extreme weather events put girls at risk.""We would expect to see an 18 percent increase in the prevalence of child marriage, equivalent to erasing five years of progress,"" it said in a report after the 2022 floods.Dildar Ali Sheikh, 31, had planned to marry off his eldest daughter Mehtab while living in an aid camp after being displaced by the floods.""When I was there, I thought to myself 'we should get our daughter married so at least she can eat and have basic facilities',"" the daily wage labourer told AFP.Mehtab was just 10 years old.""The night I decided to get her married, I couldn't sleep,"" said her mother, Sumbal Ali Sheikh, who was 18 when she married.An intervention from the NGO Sujag Sansar led to the wedding being postponed, and Mehtab was enrolled in a sewing workshop, allowing her to earn a small income while continuing her education.But when the monsoon rains fall, she is overcome by dread that her promised wedding will also arrive.""I have told my father I want to study,"" she said. ""I see married girls around me who have very challenging lives and I don't want this for myself.""","Pakistan's high rate of marriages for underage girls had been inching lower in recent years. But after unprecedented floods in 2022, rights workers warn such weddings are now on the rise. The summer monsoon between July and September is vital for the livelihoods of millions of farmers.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112579857,imgsize-1225816,width-400,resizemode-4/112579857.jpg"

The first trial was carried out in July, which resulted in the slowing down of social media platforms.PM Shehbaz Sharif’s government had allocated more than 30 billion Pakistani rupees in the development budget for the acquisition and installation of this filtering system.However, the adverse impacts after installing the firewall drew criticism from netizens and digital rights groups, who expressed fear about the future of internet-based businesses in Pakistan.government authorities had so far feigned ignorance over the internet disruptions being linked to firewall installation, and had blamed telecom and internet service providers for connectivity issues.On Thursday, however, IT minister Shaza Fatima Khawaja said her ministry was addressing complaints of slow internet speed, even though she did not link the problem with thecybersecurity firewall .“There have been complaints of slow internet and I have asked the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority to provide data of the last two weeks to look at the data traffic to know the speed issue,” she told reporters.Asked about the installation of a firewall, the minister said it was a cybersecurity matter and that countries around the world used the technology. “Previously, government was managing the web system, but with increasing international cybersecurity attacks on the country, there is a growing need for the state to strengthen its ability to prevent these attacks,” Khawaja said.Countries like China, Iran, Turkiye, and Russia have employed national firewalls for years to regulate internet content, saying they aim to pinpoint and restrict sources of propaganda content.The association of internet service providers have blamed the slow internet speed and outages on increased security and surveillance. “It’s a very discouraging situation for our customers. Many are leaving the smaller ISPs because they cannot sustain the poor service quality any more. If this continues, we will see a mass exodus of businesses from Pakistan,” read a statement issued by service providers.","Pakistan government confirms that it is upgrading its “web management system” to cope with cybersecurity threats.

Pakistan govt admits tinkering with internet: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-govt-admits-tinkering-with-internet-report/articleshow/112565175.cms,"ISLAMABAD: For the first time, the Pakistan government has confirmed that it was upgrading its "" web management system "" to cope with cyber security threats amid speculation about the installation of a so-called 'firewall' that could be leading to internet disruptions in the country, according to a media report on Friday. Millions of people across Pakistan have been facing trouble accessing internet services for some time now due to limited connectivity, particularly while using mobile data in some regions.So far, official stakeholders in Pakistan have either been feigning ignorance in response to public outcry and media queries, or claiming that the problems were because of telecom and internet service providers, or even Meta.While talking to reporters after the Senate Standing Committee on Information Technology and Tele­communi­cation meeting on Thursday, Minister of State for Information Technology and Telecommunication Shaza Fatima Khawaja said the government had sought a report from Pakistan Telecommunication Authority and other institutions over the internet disruption.""The internet should never be slow. We have even been talking about bringing 5G technology to Pakistan. There is no doubt about that, and conversations about higher internet speed are underway,"" the Dawn newspaper quoted Khawaja as saying.When the minister was asked about the 'firewall' - a blanket term used by the public to describe the causes of internet disruption in the absence of any official explanation - she said the issue had been ""blown out of proportion"".""The government has been operating a web-management system. The system is now being upgraded.""She also called the process ""a routine exercise"" across the globe to enhance internet security, without giving any detail to substantiate her claims about which other countries have deployed this system.""It is the right of the government to take measures to protect its interests given the cyber security attacks that Pakistan is facing.""This was the first time an acknowledged the government's actions, which have been blamed for everything from slow browsing speeds, the arbitrary blocking of social media platforms and WhatsApp connectivity issues on mobile data, the paper said.Meanwhile, on Thursday, users continued experiencing pro­blems in accessing social media platforms, including WhatsApp.Downdetector, a website that provides real-time information about internet outages, received an unusually high number of complaints about disruptions in WhatsApp, YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram between 12 noon and 1 pm.Meanwhile, a petition was filed in the Lahore High Court (LHC) on Thursday against a ""nationwide internet shutdown"", seeking immediate restoration of internet access.",Pakistan government confirms it is upgrading its web management system to cope with cyber security threats.
