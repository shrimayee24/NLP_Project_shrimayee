SRIHARIKOTA: The Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) on Monday successfully launched EOS-N1, along with 14 co-passenger satellites and a capsule into a re-entry trajectory in a marathon mission that lasted 108minutes, marking the space agency’s first mission of 2026. The flight comes months after a rare setback, when PSLV-C61, launched on May 18, 2025, failed to place the EOS-09 earth observation satellite into orbit due to a third-stage anomaly. The successful PSLV-C62 mission restored momentum to Isro’s workhorse launch vehicle.The 44.4-metre-tall Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV-C62) lifted off from the First Launch Pad at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota, in a commercial mission for NewSpace India Limited (NSIL). The launch marked the 64th flight of PSLV and the fifth mission of the PSLV-DL variant, with all four stages performing nominally, Isro said.Following lift-off, EOS-N1 and 14 co-passenger satellites were successfully injected into a sun-synchronous orbit at an altitude of about 505 km and an inclination of 97.5 degrees. After satellite deployment, the PS4 stage was re-started and de-orbited, followed by the separation of the Kestrel Initial Demonstrator (KID) re-entry capsule, which was placed on a controlled re-entry trajectory.The mission carried a diverse suite of technology demonstration satellites from India and overseas, covering applications such as AI processing in orbit, store-and-forward communication systems, IoT services, radiation measurement, and agricultural data collection.The primary payload, EOS-N1 (Anvesha), is a hyperspectral earth observation satellite designed for advanced surveillance and strategic monitoring.Among the notable secondary payloads was AayulSAT, developed by Bengaluru-based startup OrbitAID Aerospace, which serves as India’s first on-orbit satellite refuelling demonstrator. The mission aims to test technologies for propellant transfer and satellite servicing in low Earth orbit, a capability seen as critical for extending satellite lifetimes and enabling sustainable space operations.Another key payload, the KID re-entry capsule, a European technology demonstrator developed with a Spanish startup, separated from the PSLV’s fourth stage and was designed to splash down in the South Pacific Ocean, validating controlled atmospheric re-entry technologies.The flight also included a mix of CubeSats and small satellites from universities and startups, including missions from Dhruva Space (CGUSAT), and international partners, supporting research and commercial applications in communication, IoT and Earth observation.The successful PSLV-C62 mission follows Isro’s detailed review of the PSLV-C61 failure, one of only a handful of setbacks in PSLV’s three-decade operational history. Isro had constituted a failure analysis committee after the May 2025 mission and implemented corrective measures before returning the launcher to flight.","The Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) on Monday successfully launched EOS-N1, along with 14 co-passenger satellites and a capsule into a re-entry trajectory.

"After China, today’s mission could help India get closer to on-orbit re-fuelling",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-china-todays-mission-could-help-india-get-closer-to-on-orbit-re-fuelling/articleshow/126475379.cms,"File photo

BENGALURU: When OrbitAid’s 25-kg Ayulsat lifts off aboard Isro’s PSLV-C62 on Monday, it will be carrying more than a technology demonstration. If the mission succeeds as planned, India will take one step forward towards becoming only the second country in the world to have demonstrated on-orbit satellite refuelling, a capability so far claimed only by China.China is believed to have carried out an on-orbit refuelling demonstration last year, though details remain limited and official disclosures sparse. No other spacefaring nation, including the US, has publicly demonstrated the technology in orbit. US firm Astroscale is also developing a refuelling technology, but is yet to launch.Ayulsat won’t exactly demonstrate a full on-orbit re-fuelling. It is designed as a target satellite to validate fuel transfer in the space environment. Unlike more complex servicing missions involving two spacecraft, OrbitAid’s first step focuses on internal refuelling within a single satellite, allowing engineers to study how fluids behave in microgravity under real orbital conditions.OrbitAID founder and CEO Sakthikumar R, in an exclusive interview with TOI, said the first refuelling operation is expected to take place within four hours of launch, followed by multiple refuelling cycles over the course of the mission.“These transfers will be carried out under varying thermal conditions, pressure levels and eclipse phases to build a detailed operational handbook for future missions,” he said.The company has spent several years testing the technology on the ground and in zero-gravity environments before committing to an orbital demonstration. OrbitAid conducted high-pressure and low-pressure fluid transfer tests using propellants of different viscosities, followed by zero-gravity experiments in the US that successfully demonstrated bubble-free fuel transfer, a critical requirement for safe refuelling in space.Beyond fuel transfer, the mission also validates OrbitAid’s proprietary docking and refuelling interface, developed to support future in-orbit servicing missions. Sakthikumar said: “...The interface aligns with emerging international standards and has been developed in consultation with CONFERS, an industry-led initiative focused on best practices for rendezvous and proximity operations, on-orbit satellite servicing, and in-space servicing, assembly and manufacturing. ”If Ayulsat performs as expected, OrbitAid plans to follow it up with a chaser satellite within six to eight months. “That mission would demonstrate close-proximity operations and, later, docking and fuel transfer between two spacecraft, a key step towards extending the operational life of satellites already in orbit,” Sakthikumar said.The implications are significant. On-orbit refuelling could reduce the need for costly satellite replacements, allow spacecraft stranded in sub-optimal orbits to be recovered, and enable longer missions for strategic and commercial satellites alike.For India, the mission also marks a shift in how advanced space capabilities are being developed. Ayulsat is being flown by a private startup, highlighting the growing role of Indian industry in frontier space technologies.As Sakthikumar put it, replacement satellites are expensive, but servicing an existing one can dramatically change mission economics. Jan 12 will determine whether India can now claim a place in one of the most exclusive clubs in spaceflight.","China is believed to have carried out an on-orbit refuelling demonstration last year.

Deal St: Cognizant inks over $1bn contract with Novartis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/deal-st-cognizant-inks-over-1bn-contract-with-novartis/articleshow/126473146.cms,".

BENGALURU: Cognizant is learnt to have secured a deal worth over $1 billion from Swiss pharma major Novartis as part of a consolidation contract that includes renewals as well as new scope spanning application services, infrastructure, data and AI-led offerings, people in the know told TOI.This marks the second consecutive billion-dollar deal for Cognizant in less than a year, after it won a large contract from UnitedHealth Group last year. UnitedHealth ranks among Cognizant's biggest customers, supported by a partnership spanning nearly two decades. When TOI reached out, a Cognizant spokesperson said the company is currently in a silent period and had no comment. An email sent to Novartis did not elicit a response until the time of going to press.Those aware of developments said Cognizant's EMEA and APAC teams played a key role in clinching the deal under the leadership of Gagan Syal, head of life sciences for EMEA and APAC at Cognizant.Phil Fersht, CEO of USIT advisory HfS Research, said the rise in half-billion-dollar and larger IT services deals reflects a structural reset in how enterprises buy technology, rather than a surge in discretionary spending. ""CIOs are aggressively consolidating vendors, bundling what were once multiple mid-sized contracts into fewer, broader and longer-term engagements with clearer accountability. These deals now typically span seven to ten years. ""","Cognizant is learnt to have secured a deal worth over $1 billion from Swiss pharma major Novartis.

US Supreme Court ruling: Treasury has enough funds if Trump’s tariffs are struck down; when refunds could begin,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-supreme-court-ruling-treasury-has-enough-funds-if-trumps-tariffs-are-struck-down-when-refunds-could-begin/articleshow/126448985.cms,"'No Call From PM Modi': Trump Aide Lutnick's Shocker On India-US Trade Deal Amid Tariff Threats

If the US Supreme Court rules against President Donald Trump's emergency tariffs, the treasury has more than enough funds to pay for the tariff refunds, treasury secretary Scott Bessent said. The timeline of payments, however, might extend to weeks or even a year, he told Reuters.In an interview, Bessent said he doubted the court would rule against Trump's tariffs, but suggested that any refunds could become a “corporate boondoggle” for companies that passed on the costs to their customers.""It won't be a problem if we have to do it, but I can tell you that if it happens - which I don't think it's going to - it's just a corporate boondoggle,"" he said.""Costco, who's suing the US government, are they going to give the money back to their clients?""Bessent added that, in general, companies had not been passing tariffs on to consumers, stating there was ""very, very little, if any, pass-through,"" and disputed that Trump's tariffs had contributed to inflation. He noted that goods inflation had remained below headline inflation.Importers and trade lawyers had expected a Supreme Court ruling on Friday, but the court issued a decision on a different matter instead.It remains unclear when the court will rule on the tariff case, which challenges Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose broad tariffs on nearly every U.S. trading partner.Bessent said he believed that the longer the decision is delayed, the more likely the Supreme Court will rule in Trump's favour.With nearly $774 billion in cash as of Thursday, the treasury has more than enough to cover any refunds. Treasury borrowing estimates for January-March 2026 project an end-March cash balance of around $850 billion.""We're not talking about the money all goes out in a day. Probably over weeks, months, may take over a year, right?"" Bessent told Reuters.He also indicated that Treasury budget data for calendar year 2025 would likely show a deficit reduction of $300 billion to $400 billion from 2024, providing additional capacity. The government reported a fiscal-year deficit of $1.775 trillion for 2025, which ended on 30 September.Importers have warned that recouping any tariffs paid could be difficult if the Supreme Court finds Trump's IEEPA-based duties illegal. According to Customs and Border Protection data, $133.5 billion in such tariffs had been assessed through 14 December, with the total likely approaching $150 billion, based on Reuters calculations.Bessent disputed this estimate, saying it was ""not the number"" for tariffs potentially subject to refunds. He noted that revenues from tariffs imposed under other legal authorities also existed, but did not provide a specific figure for IEEPA-based tariffs.",Treasury secretary Scott Bessent says the treasury has more than enough funds to pay for tariff refunds.

In Fiery UK Conclave Speech, Suhel Seth Says India Has Evolved Beyond 1947, Now Shapes Global Power

NEW DELHI: In a move to shed yet another colonial relic, railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw on Friday announced discontinuing the railway uniforms introduced by the British Raj — black prince coats (bandhgala coats) — saying that “we have to find every trace of colonialism and banish them”.TOI has learnt that govt is carrying out a larger exercise across the board to identify similar colonial hangovers — attire and ceremonial rites — such as convocation gowns and caps (robe and mortarboard) which are de rigueur at university conovations and bandhgalas officers have to mandatorily wear at formal receptions. In some states personnel attached to district collectors and mayors in some states are required to wear a certain pattern of dress.Speaking at an event to honour railway officials and the zone for their exemplary works, Vaishnaw said, “We have to get rid of all colonial mindset. We need to find each of them and remove them whether it’s in our working style or dressing style. Today (Friday) I am making the first announcement. Humare jo band gale ka kala suit angrezon chalu kiya tha, aaj se yeh railway mein formal dress nehin rahegi. (From today onwards, the black prince coats that the British introduced will no longer be a part of formal dress in railways).Officials said that PM Narendra Modi has asked ministers and top bureaucrats to identify the colonial practices and to suggest alternatives that are of Indian origins and reflect the country's culture.While the practice of convocation gowns and caps has been fading, some institutions have held on to it despite the ceremonial gear not being suited for India’s hot and humid conditions and despite protests from students and faculty. Officials said that more practices, which are not commonly known to many, may be identified during consultations.Sources did not rule out the possibility of a nudge to do away with black coats and gowns that lawyers are required to wear as per Advocates Act, 1961 continuing a tradition inherited from the British legal system where it symbolised authority, dignity, and a commitment to justice. This law formalised the British-era custom, requiring advocates to wear the black robe with a white neckband for uniformity and gravity in court.",Railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw announced discontinuing the railway uniforms introduced by the British Raj.

PM Modi Offers Prayers At Somnath Temple, Witnesses Grand Drone Show & Fireworks At Swabhiman Parv

PM Modi: In face of great global uncertainty, India stands out

AHMEDABAD/RAJKOT: India must remain vigilant against ""merchants of appeasement"" who are still active and hatching conspiracies to divide the country, PM Modi said Sunday while projecting Gujarat's ancient Somnath temple as a model of resistance to what he termed ""religious terrorism"".PM Modi carried the broader theme of resilience to the Vibrant Gujarat Regional Conference in Rajkot, where he assured investors that the country offers ""extraordinary certainty"" amid global turbulence.At a rally in Somnath, where the shrine was rebuilt over centuries of pillage by invaders, the PM accused unnamed historians and politicians of obfuscating what had happened. ""Those with a mindset of religious extremism tried to disguise religious terrorism as merely motivated by wealth. They even wrote books to conceal the cruel history of hatred, atrocities and terrorism,"" he said.PM Modi said the temple’s history was inseparable from the valour of protectors like Raval Kanhardev, Veer Hamirji and Vegda Bhil, who never received due recognition for thwarting a succession of attempts to destroy the shrine. “There are no parallels anywhere in the world to Somnath’s retaliation against religious terrorism.”Harking back to how Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel faced hurdles after pledging to renovate Somnath and objections by some quarters to former President Rajendra Prasad’s 1951 temple visit, the PM said the “same forces” continue to pursue that agenda. “Only their methods have changed. In place of swords, they are now using vile means against India,” he said. In Rajkot, 200km from Somnath, PM Modi cited recent assessments by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and rating agencies S&P and Fitch as evidence of rising global confidence in India’s economy.S&P upgraded India’s rating outlook after 18 years, he said, while IMF has described the country as the engine of global growth. “In the face of great global uncertainty, India today stands out,” PM Modi said. “There’s political stability, continuity in policy, and the rapid expansion of the neo-middle class with rising purchasing power.” The PM pointed to sectoral shifts, saying that from importing nine of every 10 mobile phones in 2014, India now ranks second globally in manufacturing handsets.The country has also become the largest consumer of mobile data and hosts the world’s largest real-time digital payments platform through UPI, he said. It has the third-largest startup ecosystem, ranks among the top three in solar power generation and has emerged as the third-largest aviation market, PM Modi said. “This Reform Express won’t halt,” PM Modi said before reprising his Red Fort punchline, “Yehi samay hai, sahi samay hai (This time is the right time). ”","PM Modi: India must remain vigilant against ""merchants of appeasement"" who are still active and hatching conspiracies to divide the country.

LUCKNOW: A central GST inspector posted in New Delhi has been named an accused in a Rs 100-crore tax evasion racket uncovered by UP's Special Task Force (STF), a case that investigators said exposed deep collusion between tax officials and a network of shell firms.Inspector Mohit Agrawal, who is on the run, is accused of providing departmental protection and manipulation in return for bribes, STF officials said Sunday. Teams have been deployed to trace and arrest him.The case registered at Kavi Nagar police station in Ghaziabad district centres on large-scale GST fraud through bogus firms, fake e-way bills and forged invoices. On Friday, STF arrested four accused - New Delhi-based scrap dealer Hardeep Singh alias Prince, along with Jitendra Jha, Punit Agrawal and Shivam Singh. Investigators alleged the syndicate floated multiple shell companies and generated fake e-way bills to illegally claim input tax credit, causing estimated loss of nearly Rs 100 crore to govt.During the probe, evidence emerged showing inspector Agrawal allegedly actively aided the operation. STF officers said he accepted bribes to restore suspended firms, shield fake entities from scrutiny and manipulate records.One such firm, Adon Automobile, allegedly linked to Punit Agrawal, was suspended around three months ago but restored after inspector Agrawal's intervention. Investigators clai-med he accepted Rs 40,000 for the favour. STF also pointed to the role of Alok, a Haryana-based facilitator who allegedly supp-lied fake firms to Hardeep Singh for a lump-sum commission.WhatsApp chats recovered from Punit's phone allegedly detail discussions on payments and record manipulation, officers said, and indicated more arrests were likely as investigators widen the net across UP and neighbouring states.","Inspector Mohit Agrawal, who is on the run, is accused of providing departmental protection and manipulation in return for bribes.

Bluebird Lift-Off Shows ISRO Commercial Power As Nambi Narayanan Calls LVM-3 Game Changer Move

BENGALURU: When OrbitAid's 25-kg Ayulsat lifts off aboard Isro's PSLV-C62 Monday, the mission's success will bring India a step closer to becoming the second country in the world to demonstrate on-orbit satellite refuelling, a capability so far claimed only by China, reports Chethan Kumar.Last year, China carried out a similar demonstration, but details remain limited and official disclosures sparse. No other spacefaring nation, including the US, has publicly demonstrated the technology in orbit. However, US firm Astroscale is developing a refuelling technology but is yet to launch.Ayulsat won't demonstrate a full on-orbit re-fuelling. It is designed as a target satellite to validate fuel transfer in the space environment. Unlike more complex servicing missions involving two spacecraft, OrbitAid's first step focuses on internal refuelling within a single satellite, allowing engineers to study how fluids behave in microgravity under real orbital conditions. OrbitAid founder and CEO Sakthikumar R told TOI the first refuelling is expected to take place within four hours of launch.",OrbitAid's 25-kg Ayulsat lifts off aboard Isro's PSLV-C62 Monday.

RAIPUR: The headmistress of a govt school in Chhattisgarh has been suspended while a contractual assistant teacher faces dismissal after a Class 4 English exam paper listed 'Ram' as a possible answer to a multiple-choice question about the name of a protagonist's dog, reports Partha Behera. The paper-setter said the error occurred as a result of inadvertently dropping the last letter of 'Ramu'.The school education department announced the decision on Saturday, four days after the question paper sparked protests across state by VHP, Bajrang Dal and other organisations. Shikha Soni, headmistress of a govt primary school in Nakti village of Tilda block, had set the paper for half-yearly examinations across govt schools in Raipur division. Namrata Verma, an assistant teacher on contract, moderated it.To the question 'What is the name of Mona's dog?', students had four options to choose from: 'Bala', 'Sheru', 'Ram' and 'No one'. Soni said the 'typo' went unnoticed while Verma said she failed to spot the incorrect option.Both maintained they had no intention of hurting religious sentiments or any community.","The headmistress of a govt school in Chhattisgarh has been suspended while a contractual assistant teacher faces dismissal.

North, N-W India to see more coldwave days than normal

NEW DELHI: Cold wave to severe cold wave conditions are very likely to continue in Delhi, Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand for two more days (Jan 12-13), IMD said Sunday. The forecast and prevailing conditions in north India are in sync with the Met department's earlier prediction about this winter witnessing four-five additional cold wave days, reports Vishwa Mohan.On Sunday, Pilani (east Rajasthan) was the coldest spot in the northern plains at 1.2 degrees C. IMD said cold wave conditions may continue in ""isolated pockets"" of north and northwest India on Jan 14 (Wednesday) and ease thereafter. It predicted ""cold day"" in isolated parts of Bihar till Jan 16. Dense fog is very likely to continue during morning hours over northwest India and Bihar for the next five days, it added.D ense fog continuing during morning hours over the next few days means cold wave and foggy morning conditions may coincide with both Lohri and Makar Sankranti celebrations in most parts of north and northwest India, and parts of east India.The states in north and northwest India normally get four to six coldwave days from Dec to Feb, but this time the region is expected to get a total of eight to 11 such days, with the maximum number being reported in Jan.A coldwave is declared when the minimum (night) temperature of a meteorological station is 4°C or less in the plains and 0°C or less in hilly regions. Coldwave conditions can also be declared if temperatures are less than 10°C and below normal by at least 4.5°C. Releasing a forecast of minimum (night) temperatures, IMD said “no significant change” is likely over northwest India in the next three days, with a gradual rise of 2–3°C in the subsequent four days.However, it said, there may be gradual rise in minimum temperature of 2–3°C in Maharashtra over the next two days. There may not be significant change over the subsequent five days. During the past 24 hours (till 8.30am on Sunday), minimum (night) temperatures were below 0°C at many places in J&K, Ladakh, Gilgit, Baltistan, Muzaffarabad, a few places in Himachal Pradesh, and at isolated places in Uttarakhand. Minimum temperatures of 1–5°C were recorded at a few places in Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and north Rajasthan, IMD said.On the other hand, minimum temperatures of 5–10°C were recorded at many places in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh; a few places in Odisha, Bihar, east Rajasthan and Gujarat; and at isolated places in Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha, West Bengal, Sikkim, Assam, Meghalaya and Maharashtra.

Govt Sends Notice To Elon Musk's X On Grok AI Chatbot Misuse, IT Ministry Seeks Action Report

X is said to have accepted mistakes, pledged rectification

NEW DELHI: A week after the Centre warned of legal consequences, microblogging platform X has acknowledged lapses in content moderation linked to its AI chatbot Grok, taking down about 3,500 pieces of content and deleting over 600 accounts, govt sources said on Sunday. The platform has assured authorities that it will comply with Indian laws and will not allow obscene imagery going forward.The action follows a Jan 2 directive from the ministry of electronics and information technology (MeitY), which pulled up X over the circulation of vulgar, obscene and unlawful content generated through Grok, including non-consensual sexualised images of women. The ministry had asked X to submit a detailed action taken report within 72 hours, spelling out technical and organisational safeguards, enforcement steps and oversight mechanisms to prevent recurrence.According to sources, X has now accepted its mistake and conveyed that corrective measures have been initiated. Besides blocking content and deleting accounts, the platform has assured stricter enforcement of its policies to prevent misuse of AI-generated imagery.Earlier, X’s initial response to the notice, though lengthy, was seen by govt as falling short of expectations, as it did not clearly spell out takedown specifics or future prevention measures.This prompted MeitY to seek additional details, while warning that failure to observe due diligence obligations could result in loss of safe harbour protection under Section 79 of IT Act, apart from action under other applicable laws, including BNS.In its notice, the ministry said Grok was being misused by users to create or manipulate images through prompts and synthetic outputs, targeting women in a derogatory and vulgar manner. It stressed such activity reflected serious gaps in platform-level safeguards and enforcement. X has maintained publicly that it takes action against illegal content, including child sexual abuse material, by removing such content, suspending accounts and cooperating with law enforcement.“Anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will face the same consequences as if they uploaded illegal content,” the platform had said earlier. The controversy has not been limited to India. Regulators in UK and EU have also raised concerns over AI-generated “digital undressing” images linked to Grok. UK communications regulator Ofcom has sought clarification from X and xAI on steps taken to meet legal obligations, while European Commission has reportedly asked the platform to preserve documents related to the chatbot.With scrutiny mounting globally, govt sources said India will continue to closely monitor compliance by X to ensure that online safety norms and statutory obligations are strictly followed.","Microblogging platform X has acknowledged lapses in content moderation linked to its AI chatbot Grok.

Def experts: Azhar’s statement sign of post-Sindoor frustration

A new audio recording purportedly featuring Maulana Masood Azhar , the elusive chief of terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), has surfaced on social media, boasting that his organisation now commands ""thousands"" of suicide bombers who are prepared for immediate deployment.The clip has surfaced at a time when Pahalgam attack mastermind and Lashkar-e-Taiba deputy chief Saifullah Kasuri was captured on video claiming that the Pakistani army had invited him to lead the funeral prayers of its soldiers after Operation Sindoor - conducted by India in May last year following the terror attack in J&K. Both clips were posted on Telegram and X by pro-ISI accounts.The messages are being viewed as a desperate propaganda attempt to revitalize a group reeling from devastating losses inflicted by the Indian armed forces during the operation. Kasoori's speech was made from a school with hundreds of children visible in the audience while Azhar too is seemingly addressing a public gathering, sources said.In another video, Kasuri has also welcomed the growing diplomatic and military ties between Pakistan and Bangladesh. The latest recording features a defiant Azhar claiming that the sheer number of his followers would ""cause an uproar in the global media"" if fully revealed.Azhar said new recruits are driven by the obsession of attaining ""martyrdom"".Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) Masood Azhar asserts that these recruits are driven by a fanatical obsession with “martyrdom”, explicitly stating that they do not seek material comforts like cars, motorcycles or foreign visas. “They only ask Allah for one thing: martyrdom,” the UN-designated terrorist claimed, attempting to project a picture of high morale and spiritual conviction among his cadre.However, defence experts suggested this was little more than a “hollow threat” and a sign of severe frustration arising out of Operation Sindoor, a series of precision strikes by India in May 2025 that decimated JeM’s infrastructure and eliminated at least 10 of Azhar’s close relatives and top aides in Bahawalpur.“This audio appears to be a calculated effort to save face after the group’s leadership was ‘torn to pieces’, as recently admitted by other JeM commanders,” said a source. Interestingly, Azhar has not been seen in public since a 2019 blast at his Bahawalpur hideout, leading to persistent rumours about his health and location.This latest audio, while lacking visual proof of his life, indicates that the terror mastermind is still attempting to operate from the shadows, deep within a safe haven in Pakistan. Security agencies are now closely analysing voice samples and metadata of the clip to track its origin and assess the current threat level posed by the group’s surviving sleeper cells, sources said.","A new audio recording purportedly featuring Maulana Masood Azhar has surfaced on social media.

So far ASI was solely executing the conservation work in projects supported by donors under NCF.According to officials, the idea to empanel heritage conservation architects is being cited as yet another model of public- private partnership (PPP) aimed at capacity building to cut down delays and add to the conservation strength of ASI which has under its perview as many as 3,685 monuments across the country.The last date for submission of request for proposal (RFP) for empanelment of heritage conservation architects by NCF, ends on Monday. Nearly 20 heritage conservation architects with the necessary expertise are learnt to have submitted their proposals. After a scrutiny, the selected architects are expected to be empanelled by end of this month.The RFP document on the NCF site highlights that empaneling architects expertise in heritage conservation and restoration and provision of visitor amenities at ASI centrally protected monuments and heritage sites ""will not only complement the ASI's efforts in conservation but also help to create a national talent pool of human resource"" and ensure that the work is completed within the time frame fixed by the donor.The NCF has served as a financing mechanism for enabling donors and sponsor institutions to support protect, restore, conserve and develop India's cultural heritage directly as partners with the govt.",The conservation of centrally protected Archaeological Survey of India monuments will be opened up soon to the private sector.

India-US trade figures



US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick made a big statement over why the India-US trade deal is not sealed yet, claiming that it was due to PM Modi not calling Trump. Speaking at the All-In Podcast, hosted by Chamath Palihapitiya, Lutnick said, ""Let's be clear, it's his deal. He's the closer. He does the deal. So I said, you got to have Modi. It's all set up. You have to have Modi...they were uncomfortable doing it.""""So Modi didn't call,"" he claimed.This statement comes after US President Donald Trump, on Thursday, approved a bill that can impose at least 500% tariffs for countries buying Russian oil, aiming to ""punish them."" US senator Lindsey Graham said that the bill would give US tremendous leverage against countries like China, India and Brazil to incentivize them to stop buying the cheap Russian oil.In February, leaders from both countries directed officials to begin negotiations, setting an initial goal of completing the first phase by autumn 2025. However the deal still remains stalled with India's trade with Russia remaining a major flashpoint.Back in August, US imposed additional tariffs on Indian imports to the country alleging that New Delhi's purchase of Russian oil was fueling Moscow's 'war machine' in Ukraine.Since then total tariffs on Indian goods stand at 50%, including 25% of additional tariffs and 25% of Trump's reciprocal tariffs.Since then, two nations have held many rounds of trade talks with the meeting back from December 10 to December 12, when US officials visited New Delhi. India and the US are engaged in parallel negotiations, aiming to develop a framework trade deal to address tariff issues, and focus on a comprehensive trade agreement.The proposed agreement aims to more than double bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030 from the current $191 billion.The US remained India’s largest trading partner for the fourth consecutive year in 2024–25, with bilateral trade standing at $131.84 billion, of which $86.5 billion came from Indian exports. The American market accounts for roughly 18% of India’s total goods exports, 6.22% of its imports, and 10.73% of overall merchandise trade.Exporters have highlighted the need to finalise the agreement, noting that India’s merchandise exports to the US fell for a second straight month in October, declining 8.58% to $6.3 billion, largely due to the steep tariffs imposed by Washington.","US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick made a big statement over why the India-US trade deal is not sealed yet.

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Gold February futures on MCX are trading near ₹1,37,800 after a sharp pullback from higher levels. The recent recovery attempt appears corrective in nature, with price facing strong resistance near the previous breakdown zone. Technical indicators suggest that upside momentum is losing steam, making higher levels vulnerable to fresh selling pressure. The intraday setup favors a sell-on-rise approach in the ₹1,37,800–₹1,38,000 range.Prices are trading below the short-term EMA cluster, with EMA 8 failing to sustain above EMA 21. This indicates weak short-term structure and suggests that rallies are likely to be sold into rather than extended.Gold has moved back toward the mid-Bollinger band after testing lower levels, but the upper band near ₹1,38,000 continues to act as a firm resistance. This positioning supports the view of capped upside in the near term.• Resistance Zone: ₹1,37,800 – ₹1,38,000• Support Levels: ₹1,36,800 followed by ₹1,36,400Failure to sustain above pivot resistance keeps the intraday bias tilted to the downside.RSI is around 60, indicating a short-term recovery but not strong enough to confirm trend reversal. This level often precedes consolidation or pullback when price approaches resistance.MACD has shown a brief positive crossover, but histogram bars are flattening, signaling waning bullish momentum. This increases the probability of a rollover from higher levels.The recovery has been accompanied by moderate volume, while open interest remains soft, hinting that the move lacks strong long buildup and is prone to reversal.• Strategy: Sell on rise• Sell Zone: ₹1,37,800 – ₹1,38,000• Stop-Loss: ₹1,39,100• Downside Target: ₹1,36,400• Bias: Bearish below ₹1,38,000; strength only above ₹1,39,100.Gold’s intraday technical structure remains vulnerable as prices trade below key moving averages and momentum indicators fail to confirm sustained strength. The resistance band near ₹1,38,000 is likely to attract selling pressure. Traders are advised to sell on rise around ₹1,37,800–₹1,38,000, keep a strict stop-loss at ₹1,39,100, and look for a move toward ₹1,36,400 during the session.","Gold price rally appears to be losing steam for now, says Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst - Commodity and Currency, LKP Securities.

Beginning in 2026, the world faces economic insecurity, record inflation, and a cost-of-living crisis. But for the affluent few, it all appears far less significant than their bank accounts. Today, the total fortune of the world's 14 richest men exceeds $3 trillion in technology, luxury, fashion, AI, and investments. Elon Musk leads the league for the fifth year in a row, with a staggering $717.9 billion wealth that has nearly doubled in the last several years. In contrast, newcomers have joined this league as a result of AI and semiconductor storms, as well as anticipated investments. The symbolic wealth levels of this important few contrast with the growing disparity between the issues of the globe and the super-rich.As of 2026, the world’s wealthiest men continue to amass staggering fortunes despite global economic challenges. According to Forbes, the top 10 richest men, led by Elon Musk, now hold combined wealth exceeding $3 trillion, dominating sectors from technology and AI to luxury, fashion, and global investments, reshaping markets, influencing policy, driving innovation, and redefining modern economic power.Elon Musk, Tesla, SpaceX, and X’s CEO, sustains his dominance in the list of global billionaires.The value of Musk's net worth escalated from 2021’s $300 billion to 2026's $717.9 billion because of the phenomenal performance of electric cars, space exploration, and social media reach. Musk's entry and eventual support or endorsement of Donald Trump in politics made news but made no tangible contribution to or subtraction from his net worth. Tesla is leading in global electric cars, while SpaceX is working towards making rocket technology reusable. Musk's projects also cover energy storage, AI, and neural tech, providing him with multiple income streams. Musk's increases in net worth despite controversies, disagreements with authorities, or unpleasant encounters with influential persons in social media like Twitter make him the richest person in planet Earth.Co-founder of Google, Larry Page, has leaped to the second position in the worldwide list. There has been a remarkable increase in his wealth from 133.1 billion to 258.3 billion dollars in one year alone. Though Larry has kept himself away from the limelight, he has been pursuing long-term ventures such as the “moonshot” projects of Alphabet, which comprises self-driving automobiles and AI-based health care. Though he is no longer actively involved with Google, his impact on the company’s planning has ensured an increase in his wealth. He is the epitome of success for innovators who firmly believe that innovations related to the tech infrastructure of data enterprises will result in massive returns.Oracle founder Larry Ellison, who holds 98% ownership of Lāna‘i in Hawaii, has moved up to the third position for 2026. This follows his net worth rising from $199.5 billion. He has also served as a technology advisor for Artificial Intelligence policy and strategy with expertise gleaned from his years at Oracle. He has diversified his portfolio, including involvement with ‘real estate, sailing, and life sciences. Ellison has demonstrated his capacity to engage with entrepreneurship and diversify his reach globally, keeping him relevant as one of the most significant stakeholders among the wealthy across the world.Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, has slipped to the fourth position, down from $248.1 billion last year. Bezos is a visibly successful person due to his dominance in online e-commerce, cloud computing through AWS, and media ventures like Prime Video. Bezos has had enormous success due to decades of expansion, acquisitions, and reach, but he still invests in space technology through Blue Origin, along with philanthropic work in climate change and healthcare.Sergey Brin, Google co-founder, is at number five with a net worth of $238.4 billion. The position is an improvement from last year, when he ranked fifth with a net worth of $155.4 billion. Sergey Brin's net worth has been strengthened by Alphabet’s success in AI, cloud computing technology, and autonomous driving technology. Sergey Brin is still engaged in innovation and is a major beneficiary of Alphabet's long-term initiatives.Facebook’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, has also minutely slid out from the top five richest people, with a wealth ranking of $223 billion from the previous year’s assessment of $219.9 billion. Mark Zuckerberg keeps pushing the initiatives for the “metaverse,” AI, and social networking. Zuckerberg’s presence in shaping technology policies and trends around the world has not changed, even though there are certain fluctuations.France's luxury leader, Bernard Arnault, has fallen to the sixth spot from the first position in 2024, but the value of his net worth, which is sourced from the success of LVMH as well as brands such as Louis Vuitton, Dior, and Sephora, is still a remarkable $192.4 billion, slightly lower from the previous year's $195.1 billion, thus symbolizing the timeless use value of exclusive luxury products.A Taiwanese national, Nvidia's co-founder, Jensen Huang, has experienced tremendous growth because of the AI and silicon revolution. His net worth increased from 128.4 billion to 163.9 billion dollars. Huang's vision to develop chips for the gaming, AI, and data center markets has made him one of the leading tech billionaires globally.The 95-year-old investment guru and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway has an estimated net worth of $146.8 billion, a marginal improvement from $143.4 billion. The key to Mr. Buffett’s achievement is his long period of value investing and his knack for investing in businesses during favorable times and diversifying his investment portfolios across various sectors.Amancio Ortega, the Spanish fashion tycoon behind Zara, is still a giant in the industry with an estimated wealth of 145 billion dollars. His success in the fast-fashion industry has been fueled by expansion and supply chain management. Amancio Ortega proves that the success in the affordable fashion industry translates to the accumulation of unimaginable wealth.","Elon Musk, Tesla, SpaceX, and X’s CEO, sustains his dominance in the list of global billionaires. Co-founder of Google, Larry Page, has leaped to the second position in the worldwide list. Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, slipped to the fourth position from $248.1 billion last year. The total fortune of the world's 14 richest men exceeds $3 trillion.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126415089,imgsize-47860,width-400,resizemode-4/top-10-richest-men-in-the-world-2026-elon-musk-leads-717-billion-fortune-ahead-of-larry-page-jeff-bezos-and-mark-zuckerberg.jpg"

What defines airline and airport punctuality





On-time performance has always been one of the key factors appreciated by air travel, impacting the lives of millions of air travellers every day. In Cirium's 2025 On-Time Performance Review, more than 1.8 million flights were considered to rank airlines and airports. An airline is said to be punctual if its flight arrives or departs within a time frame of 15 minutes, denoting the landing's benefit and support. This year, worldwide leaders like Qatar Airways, Aeromexico, and Delta Air Lines were at the top, and in the Asia-Pacific leaderboard, IndiGo, from India, secured a position in the top 10. Yet, with certain operational issues in Dec. 2025, the airline recorded a considerable 78.12% rate for arriving flights in a reduced total of 802,418 flights.The 2025 Cirium On-Time Performance Review shows that global and regional leaders maintain schedules despite operational challenges. While Qatar Airways, Aeromexico, and Delta dominate globally, IndiGo demonstrates that Indian carriers can compete on punctuality in the Asia-Pacific region. Travellers seeking reliable journeys in 2026 can now consider these rankings as a guide for selecting airlines and airports that prioritise efficiency, timeliness, and consistent operational excellence.Cirium uses on-time performance measured through arrivals within 15 minutes of schedule and departures within 15 minutes to assess efficiency. Airports are carefully evaluated on operational difficulty, potential disruption impact on passengers, and overall effectiveness in handling high volumes of passenger traffic. These rigorous criteria, combined with factors such as weather challenges, air traffic complexity, and infrastructure quality, have set a reliable global standard for airline and airport rankings, helping travellers and industry professionals better understand overall performance and operational excellence.","The 2025 Cirium On-Time Performance Review shows that global and regional leaders maintain schedules despite operational challenges.

Udaipur Leela Palace fined Rs 10 lakh: Staff entered occupied room with master key; pregnant guest suffered mental trauma,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/udaipur-leela-palace-fined-rs-10-lakh-staff-entered-occupied-room-with-master-key-pregnant-guest-suffered-mental-trauma/articleshow/126451091.cms,"Chennai Headlines Today — The Biggest Updates You Need to Know.







CHENNAI: A Chennai consumer court has ordered luxury hotel The Leela Palace, Udaipur, to pay more than Rs 10.65 lakh in compensation and refund after holding it guilty of deficiency in service over a serious breach of guest privacy involving a pregnant woman.The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Chennai (North), in its December 16 order, found that a housekeeping staff member unlawfully entered an occupied room using a master key while the complainant and her husband were inside the washroom, causing severe mental trauma and humiliation.The complainant, a Chennai-based advocate, had booked a premium “Grand Room with Lake View” at the Leela Palace, Udaipur, for Rs 55,500 on a non-refundable basis for a one-day stay in January 2025 to celebrate her husband’s birthday and their baby-moon. The commission noted that despite the room being occupied, a housekeeping associate entered the room within seconds of ringing the bell, relying on internal standard operating procedures.Rejecting the hotel’s defence, the commission held that internal SOPs cannot override a guest’s fundamental right to privacy, particularly in a five-star hotel charging premium tariffs. It observed that entry using a master key within less than a minute was unreasonable and unsafe, especially when the washroom was in use.The commission relied on contemporaneous evidence, including WhatsApp communications with hotel officials, apology letters issued by the housekeeping staff and hotel management on the same day, and photographs showing a broken washroom door and a non-functional CCTV camera outside the room. It said these documents supported the complainant’s version and disproved the hotel’s claim that there was no immediate protest.The court also criticised the hotel’s conduct after the incident, citing delays in sharing CCTV footage, misleading assurances, and harassment at checkout, when the complainant and her husband were made to wait for hours and their luggage was withheld. The complainant’s pregnancy, the commission said, aggravated the trauma and imposed a higher duty of care on the hotel.Holding the hotel liable, the commission ordered refund of the full room tariff of Rs 55,500 with 9% interest from January 26, 2025, Rs 10 lakh as compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages, and Rs 10,000 towards litigation costs, to be paid within two months.","Chennai consumer court orders luxury hotel The Leela Palace, Udaipur, to pay more than Rs 10.65 lakh in compensation and refund.

BJP Targets Mamata Banerjee Over ED Raid At I-PAC, Alleges Evidence Tampering

KOLKATA: A Rs 20 crore hawala transaction allegedly changed hands six times to erase its trail before reaching political consultancy, Indian Political Action Committee (I-PAC)'s Goa office from Kolkata, Enforcement Directorate (ED) has alleged in a petition filed before Calcutta high court.ED said that proceeds of crime generated from alleged coal smuggling in West Bengal were routed through domestic and international hawala channels and used to fund political campaigns. One such transfer reached I-PAC during Goa assembly elections in 2021-22, the agency claimed. The allegations are part of an ongoing investigation and are yet to be tested in court.According to ED, investigators traced the money trail to a former director of a New Delhi-based non-banking financial services firm, who allegedly contacted a person known as Munna to move the funds. ED said that Munna linked up with another member of a hawala network, after which money reached a manager of a Kolkata-based hawala firm.In a statement to ED, the hawala firm manager allegedly said that he arranged cash delivery in Goa during 2021-22. The cash was to be handed over to an employee of an event management company, who then contacted the firm's director and its sister concern.ED claimed both companies were handling events and campaign-related work for I-PAC during Goa assembly elections.ED told high court that I-PAC co-founder and director Pratik Jain handled the consultancy's Goa operations at the time. Based on these findings, searches were carried out on Jan 8 at 10 locations in New Delhi and Kolkata, ED said. One of the locations was Jain's home on Loudon Street in central Kolkata.The agency alleged that proceeds originated from a coal smuggling syndicate led by Anup Majee, accused of stealing and illegally excavating coal from premises of Eastern Coalfields Limited, a central public sector coal producer operating across parts of Bengal and Jharkhand. ED claimed stolen coal was sold to factories and plants in districts, including Bankura, Purba Bardhaman and Purulia - all in western and central parts of Bengal.Factory owners allegedly paid in cash, which syndicate members collected and deposited at an office in Bhamuria, a locality in Asansol subdivision of Paschim Bardhaman district, the central agency said."," Enforcement Directorate (ED) claims proceeds of crime generated from alleged coal smuggling in West Bengal were routed through domestic and international hawala channels.

AHMEDABAD: Dwarka, the ancient Gujarat coastal town closely associated with the legend of Lord Krishna and home to the revered Dwarkadhish Temple, is set to witness renewed rounds of archaeological excavations, both on land and underwater, senior officials of Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) have said. The proposed work aims to explore previously unexamined areas using modern technology to gain a deeper understanding of the region’s historical and cultural past.Underwater archaeological excavations at Dwarka were last carried out between 2005 and 2007, while limited exploratory studies were conducted again in 2025.According to ASI officials, the upcoming phase will be more extensive and systematic. Alok Tripathi, additional director-general of ASI, toldthat new areas at Beyt Dwarka and unexplored underwater zones will be covered by the agency’s Underwater Archaeology Wing (UAW).“Dwarka has been under study for nearly 40 years, but the work so far has been limited in scope and objectives. We are now examining the other side of the mouth of the Gomti river,” Tripathi said.Experts said modern tools and technology would be deployed to enable larger and deeper excavations in the Arabian Sea. Tripathi himself was part of the five-member UAW team that conducted underwater exploratory work at Dwarka in Feb last year.During that time, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had also dived underwater off Dwarka coast to view submerged remains discovered on the seabed, drawing national attention to the site.On land, the focus will beon relatively undisturbed areas of Beyt Dwarka. Earlier excavations were largely concentrated near the cliff area. “We are now going deeper inside the forest area, where we have observed signs of a significant settlement. The site has some remarkable features, and excavations at lower levels could reveal important details about settlement planning, economic activities, arts and crafts, and the way of life of the inhabitants,” Tripathi said.The site has attracted attention alike due to the legend of the sunken city of Dwarka, believed to be founded by Lord Krishna. TheASI website indicates that explorations were carried out to understand the submerged archaeological remains off the coast of Dwarka as sculptures and stone anchors were found during low tide in coastal areas.The excavations so far have yielded many antiquities, including terracotta objects, beads, fragmented bangles, copper rings, iron ingots and pottery among others, according to the ASI website.Apart from Dwarka, the ASI has also initiated excavations at other key sites in Gujarat. Work has begun at Valabhipur, the ancient capital located in Bhavnagardistrict, and at Lothal, the Harappan-era site renowned for its water structure believed to be among the world’s oldest dockyards. With the upcoming National Maritime Heritage Complex near Lothal, archaeologists are exposing a larger area of the site using advanced tools and techniques. Tripathi emphasised that archaeology goes beyond excavation. “Our task is to place findings in perspective and fill gaps in historical understanding,” he said, adding that India’s use of technology in archaeology is on par with global standards and increasingly relies on interdisciplinary approaches.Gujarat has seen significant archaeological activity over the past decade, including extensive ASI-led excavations at Vadnagar in Mehsana district, PM Modi’s hometown, uncovering evidence of continuous habitation over two millennia. The state is also home to major Harappan sites such as Dholavira, now a Unesco World Heritage Site, and Lothal, highlighting Gujarat’s rich and layered archaeological heritage.","Dwarka, the ancient Gujarat coastal town closely associated with the legend of Lord Krishna, is set to witness renewed rounds of archaeological excavations.

BMC Becomes Mega Battleground As Thackerays Reunite And Alliances Shift Ahead Of Civic Wars 2026







MUMBAI: BJP candidate Makrand Narwekar, brother of state assembly speaker Rahul Narwekar, is among the richest candidates in the forthcoming BMC elections , with assets worth Rs 124 crore declared in his affidavit.The 47-year-old two-time corporator, listed as an advocate in his affidavit, purchased 27 land parcels in Alibaug between Oct 2022 and Nov 2025. “Everything is shown in my affidavit. I would only like to say this is a live example of India shining,” he told TOI .With infrastructure projects such as the Atal Setu, RoRo ferry to Alibaug, the value of these holdings has suddenly gone up, said Narwekar, whose assets were listed as Rs 6.32 crore in 2017 and Rs 3.67 crore in 2012.Around 35% of the candidates contesting the BMC elections are crorepatis. His sister-in-law Harshita Narwekar, who is contesting from ward 225, has declared assets worth Rs 63.62 crore — up from Rs 10.74 crore in 2017. Close behind is Sana Abbas Qureshi with Rs 60.3 crore. Contesting from Kalina on a Samajwadi Party ticket, Qureshi says the collapse of the area pushed her into politics.“This is my first election,” she said. “My family runs schools.But I realised that if you want change, you cannot only complain — you have to be a part of it.” Every lane, she says, carries its own catalogue of neglect. “Sanitation is a mess. Toilets don’t even have doors. We need better hospitals, better schools. The problems are visible everywhere,” she added.Another affidavit drawing attention is that of Samadhan Sarvankar, son of former MLA Sada Sarvankar, who is seeking a second term as corporator. Sarvankar has declared assets of Rs 46.59 crore, up from Rs 9.43 crore he reported in 2017. Of this, Rs 40.59 crore is listed under immovable assets. Meanwhile, his sister, Priya Sarvankar, who is contesting from Dadar Shivaji Park, has declared assets of Rs 12.16 crore. Former mayor Shraddha Jadhav, the first female mayor from the Shiv Sena from 2009-2012, has assets worth Rs. 46.34 crore.Independent candidate Ashok Gupta, a pan vendor from Bandra, has declared assets of Rs 1.6 crore. Gupta says he worked for years for Sharad Pawar’s party but was denied a ticket, prompting him to contest as an independent. “I want to work to make Mumbai a better city,” says Gupta, who assets include an SRA house worth Rs 1 crore, some savings and his wife’s jewellery.And then, there are candidates like Khandu Nana Khandekar, a rickshaw driver from Mankhurd–Govandi, whose affidavit carries no such heft. “When auto drivers stand for elections, they go door-to-door touching people’s feet,” he said. “But after they get elected, they behave like kings. I am not like that. I will never become that. So, people will vote for me.”","Around 35% of the candidates contesting the BMC elections are crorepatis.

Mathematics with real-world impact



Securing the quantum future

Indian-origin mathematician Nalini Joshi has been named New South Wales’ Scientist of the Year, becoming the first mathematician to receive the state’s top science honour in Australia. The recognition highlights her pioneering work in applied mathematics and its growing importance in addressing complex scientific and technological challenges, from climate modelling to secure digital communications.The award places a spotlight on the often unseen role mathematics plays in modern life, with Joshi’s research helping to shape advances in fields such as fibre-optic technology, nonlinear physics and emerging quantum systems.Nalini Joshi is a world-leading applied mathematician and a Professor of Mathematics at the University of Sydney, where she currently serves as Chair of Applied Mathematics. She made history as the first woman appointed Professor of Mathematics at the university, a milestone widely seen as a breakthrough for gender representation in Australian academia.Her research is internationally recognised in the field of integrable systems, a branch of mathematics that studies complex nonlinear equations.These equations are essential for describing real-world phenomena that do not behave in simple or predictable ways, including fluid flows, wave motion and optical systems.Although rooted in theory, Joshi’s work has had wide practical influence. Integrable systems play a crucial role in fibre-optic communications, which form the backbone of the internet and global data networks, as well as in climate science, where advanced mathematical models help scientists understand highly sensitive and chaotic environmental systems.Colleagues often note that her research demonstrates how abstract mathematics can drive innovation across disciplines, even when its contributions remain largely invisible to the public.In recent years, Joshi has increasingly focused on the implications of quantum computing, particularly in the area of cryptography. Cryptography is the science of keeping information secure so that only authorised people can access it. It is what protects online banking, digital payments, emails, messaging apps and government systems by scrambling data into coded forms that are extremely difficult to break.While quantum computers promise major advances in areas such as drug discovery and materials science, they also pose a serious risk to today’s cryptographic systems. Powerful quantum machines could potentially crack many of the encryption methods currently used to protect financial systems and digital infrastructure.Joshi has warned that governments and industries are not sufficiently prepared for this shift. She has highlighted Australia’s limited number of specialists capable of developing post-quantum cryptography, new encryption techniques designed to withstand quantum attacks, and has argued that long-term investment in advanced mathematics is essential.“Mathematics is central to securing our quantum future,” she has said.The New South Wales Scientist of the Year award also acknowledges Joshi’s broader contributions as a leader, mentor and advocate for science. She has been a strong voice for strengthening mathematical education and research capacity, and for recognising mathematics as a foundational discipline that enables progress across science and technology.",Nalini Joshi has been named New South Wales’ Scientist of the Year.

Iran Burns As Protests Explode, Regime Elites Quietly Seek French Exit: Report

Dubai suspends key flight paths to Iran

Airline Status Impacted Cities flydubai 6 Flights Cancelled Tehran (IKA), Shiraz (SYZ), Mashhad (MHD) Emirates Transit Suspended Passengers starting from other cities cannot board for Iran. Air Arabia Reviewing Schedule Expect delays or short-notice cancellations for Sharjah routes.

The ""Transit Rule""

Why your flight was cancelled?

What travellers should do?

Check flight status before leaving for the airport: Airlines and airport authorities recommend confirming your scheduled flight online or via the airline’s app.

Stay updated with official notifications: Airlines often send updates via email or SMS, ensure your booking contact information is current.

Prepare for possible rebooking or refund: If a flight is cancelled, passengers usually qualify for free rebooking, changes, or full refunds under airline policies when cancellations are initiated by the carrier.

Monitor travel advisories: Government travel warnings and airspace updates may influence airline operations and security protocols, check with official sources before planning.





In a swift response to shifting regional dynamics, Friday, January 9, 2026, became a day of unexpected ""grounding"" for hundreds of travelers. At least six major flights scheduled to depart from Dubai to various Iranian hubs were abruptly cancelled.According to data from the Dubai Airports website, these cancellations aren't just minor delays; they represent a cautious, safety-first response to ""heightened regional uncertainty"" and ongoing civil unrest within Iran.The atmosphere at Dubai International (DXB) remains calm but busy as ground staff work to reroute passengers. For the ""common traveler,"" this means the usual hop across the Gulf has become a waiting game. These disruptions follow a pattern seen across the Middle East this week, where airlines like Turkish Airlines also scrapped seven flights to Tehran, signaling a broader industry-wide pivot toward caution as regional stability fluctuates.The cancellations have primarily targeted the most popular gateways into Iran. If you are flying with flydubai, a total of six flights have been officially removed from today's schedule.Emirates has taken a different approach, focusing on its transit network to manage the flow of passengers during this volatile window.For those traveling from London, Paris, or New York with a connection in Dubai to Iran, the rules have changed overnight. Emirates has officially stated that customers transiting through Dubai with a final destination in Iran, Iraq, or Jordan will not be accepted for travel at their original point of departure.This is a strategic move to prevent thousands of travelers from becoming ""stranded"" inside Dubai International Airport (DXB). If your ticket starts outside the UAE, your journey will likely be paused at your home airport until the regional safety assessment is cleared.The decision is purely a precautionary measure driven by ""heightened regional uncertainty"" and the need to ensure airspace safety. The primary driver behind today's cancellations is a massive wave of civil unrest sweeping through Iran.Since late December 2025, a sudden 30% devaluation of the Iranian Rial and soaring inflation sparked protests that have now spread to over 150 locations across 27 provinces, including Tehran, Isfahan, and Mashhad.This isn't just a local protest; it has evolved into a significant political challenge.Protesters have been seen chanting slogans like ""Not Gaza, not Lebanon, my life for Iran,"" expressing frustration over the government's focus on regional proxy conflicts while the domestic economy struggles.For airlines, flying into major cities where street battles and ""debris-strewn roads"" are being reported on state TV poses a high operational risk for both crews and passengers.If you’re planning to travel between Dubai (or other UAE airports) and Iran, here’s what you should do:Flight cancellations between Dubai and Iran highlight the importance of staying informed, checking live flight updates, and planning flexible travel arrangements. While some flights are resuming as airspace reopens, schedules can still be affected by regulatory decisions and safety precautions.

Why Jensen Huang believes being Nvidia CEO is a ‘great responsibility’

“great responsibility”

“We are the captain of this industry and we have supply chain partners and collaboration partners all over the world who are counting on us to do our part. So there is a great responsibility that comes with our company. It took us 34 years to get here. We're getting good at it. If you do something for 34 years, you can figure it out,”

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has revealed he has no plans to step down from his position at the company anytime soon. He noted that he will remain in charge for now. During a question-and-answer session at CES, 62-year-old Huang said this in response to shareholders' questions about his future at the chipmaker. Huang has led Nvidia since he started the company in 1993. He said he currently has no plans to leave his role, while the company has yet to announce who may replace him in the coming days.Huang attributed his long tenure to his continued interest in the company’s operations and his ability to meet performance expectations. He said,Huang said that there is ain being Nvidia's CEO. He noted that the AI chipmaker's performance will not just affect the tech industry but will also impact the entire market.he explained.Huang and Nvidia will have a lot of work to do in the coming years. At CES, Huang announced Nvidia’s next-generation Vera Rubin superchip, which will begin shipping later this year. The company also announced a partnership with Mercedes-Benz to develop self-driving technology that will compete with Tesla's Autopilot.The Vera Rubin platform, which is named after American astronomer Vera Rubin, who changed how scientists understand galaxy motion, was one of the biggest highlights. It promises to train AI 10 times more efficiently than its previous version, Blackwell. According to Huang, a 10 trillion-parameter model can now be trained in one month using one-quarter of the chips.Huang noted.Huang has been Nvidia's CEO since 1993. He took the company from a stock price of just pennies per share between 1999 and 2016 to more than $187 today, making it the most valuable company in the world.His tenure has been much longer than that of most other tech leaders, including Apple's Tim Cook (14 years), Meta's Mark Zuckerberg (22 years), and Tesla's Elon Musk (who founded SpaceX in 2002).Born in Taipei in 1963, Huang moved to the US at age nine after his parents sent him to study there. Due to a mistake, he ended up at a tough school in rural Kentucky, where he did chores like cleaning toilets and helped his roommate learn to read.He finished high school at 16, studied electrical engineering, and worked night shifts at a diner to support himself. In 1993, Huang co-founded Nvidia at a Denny’s restaurant.

Investor concerns beyond Jeff Bezos







Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has once again cautioned that artificial intelligence is presently an ‘industrial bubble’, even he insisted that the technology itself is real and will ultimately deliver huge amounts of benefits to the society. Recently, speaking at the Italian Tech Week alongside Exor CEO John Elkann, Bezos said that the excitement around AI has led to unusual investor behaviour, with billions of dollars flowing into companies regardless strong fundamentals.Bezos explained that bubbles are characterised by inflated stock prices and a rush of funding into both good and bad ideas. This makes it difficult for the investor to distinguish.Bezos further outlined the hallmarks of bubbles. He said that the current AI climate as one where “every experiment or idea gets funded,” even if the fundamentals are weak. He pointed to unusual behavior such as small companies with only a handful of employees receiving billions of dollars in investment. This, he said, is a hallmark of industrial bubbles, where excitement drives capital into ventures indiscriminately.Despite this caution, Bezos feels that the technology itself is genuine and transformative. “AI is real, and it is going to change every industry,” he told the audience. He further compared the situation to the biotech bubble of the 1990s, which witnessed many companies fail but ultimately produced some life-saving drugs. Industrial bubbles, he argued, are not necessarily harmful; when the dust settles, society benefits from the inventions that survive.Bezos’ remarks echo a growing chorus of warnings from business leaders. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has previously said the AI market is in a bubble. At the same event in Turin, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon cautioned that investor excitement often overlooks risks, predicting a “reset” or “drawdown” in valuations. Similarly, Karim Moussalem, chief investment officer at Selwood Asset Management, recently said the AI trade is beginning to resemble “one of the great speculative manias of market history. ”","Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has once again cautioned that artificial intelligence is presently an ‘industrial bubble’ However, he insisted that the technology itself is real and will ultimately deliver huge amounts of benefits to the society.

This move allows for direct-to-cell services and speeds up to 1 Gbps. The FCC also eased coverage overlap rules, aiming for more reliable service and increased competition.

Putin's 'Starlink-KILLER' Spooks NATO; New Intel Claims Russia Exploring Anti-Satellite Zone Weapon

What FCC Chairman Brendan Carr said about the SpaceX approval

“This FCC authorisation is a game-changer for enabling next-generation services. By authorising 15,000 new and advanced satellites, the FCC has given SpaceX the green light to deliver unprecedented

satellite broadband capabilities

, strengthen competition, and help ensure that no community is left behind.”

“We find that authorisation for additional satellites is in the public interest, even as the Gen2

Starlink

Upgrade satellites remain untested on orbit. We defer authorisation of the remaining 14,988 proposed Gen2 Starlink satellites, including satellites proposed for operations above 600 km,”





The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has authorised SpaceX to expand its satellite network to enhance global internet and mobile connectivity. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, the US government agency recently approved a request from the rocket company to deploy 7,500 second-generation Starlink satellites. This authorisation will increase the total permitted number of satellites to 15,000 and will allow the company to operate across five different frequencies to increase network capacity and coverage.The expanded satellite constellation is also intended to support direct-to-cell connectivity and provide internet speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second, the Reuters report claims. According to the FCC, the additional hardware will facilitate mobile services outside the US while providing supplemental coverage within the country. As per the report, the agency relaxed earlier regulations that limited overlapping coverage, enabling more reliable service.In a statement to Reuters, FCC Chairman Brendan Carr said,The Reuters report noted that SpaceX had applied for permission to deploy close to 30,000 satellites, but the FCC said it is currently approving only 15,000 of them.the FCC noted.The FCC has even ordered SpaceX to launch 50% of its approved Gen2 satellites, put them in their assigned orbits, and operate them by December 1, 2028.SpaceX must launch the remaining satellites by December 2031. It must also complete the deployment of all 7,500 first-generation satellites into orbit by late November 2027.Last week, Starlink said it would start moving its satellites to lower orbits in 2026. The satellites currently orbiting at around 550 km (342 miles) will be lowered to 480 km. This move is meant to improve space safety.In December, Starlink said one of its satellites had a problem in space that created a small amount of debris. The company lost communication with the spacecraft, which was orbiting at 418 km. This kind of accident is rare for the satellite internet company.SpaceX has become the world's largest satellite operator through Starlink, a network of about 9,400 satellites that provide broadband internet to consumers, governments, and businesses.The FCC's former head, Jessica Rosenworcel, demanded more competition for SpaceX's Starlink in 2024. She pointed out that at the time, Starlink was in charge of almost two-thirds of all operational satellites.","The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has authorised SpaceX to expand its satellite network to enhance global internet and mobile connectivity.

Bill Gates pens the year 2026 note; says: Thing I am most upset about is ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/bill-gates-pens-the-year-2026-note-says-thing-i-am-most-upset-about-is-/articleshow/126450754.cms,"Bill Gates No Longer among Top 10 Billionaires: The Real Reason

Here’s Bill Gates annual 2026 letter in full

Optimism with footnotes

As we start 2026, I am thinking about how the year ahead will set us up for the decades to come.

I have always been an optimist. When I founded Microsoft, I believed a digital revolution powered by great software would make the world a better place. When I started the

Gates Foundation

, I saw an opportunity to save and improve millions of lives because critical areas like children’s health were getting so little money.

In both cases, the results exceeded my expectations. We are far better off than when I was born 70 years ago. I believe the world will keep improving—but it is harder to see that today than it has been in a long time.

Friends and colleagues often ask me how I stay optimistic in an era with so many challenges and so much polarization. My answer is this:

I am still an optimist because I see what innovation accelerated by artificial intelligence will bring.

But these days, my optimism comes with footnotes.

The thing I am most upset about is the fact that the world went backwards last year on a key metric of progress: the number of deaths of children under 5 years old. Over the last 25 years, those deaths went down faster than at any other point in history. But in 2025, they went up for the first time this century, from 4.6 million in 2024 to 4.8 million in 2025—an increase driven by less support from rich countries to poor countries.

This trend will continue unless we make progress in restoring aid budgets.

The next five years will be difficult as we try to get back on track and work to scale up new lifesaving tools. Yet I remain optimistic about the long-term future. As hard as last year was, I don’t believe we will slide back into the Dark Ages.

I believe that, within the next decade, we will not only get the world back on track but enter a new era of unprecedented progress.

The key will be, as always, innovation. Consider this: An HIV diagnosis used to be a death sentence. Today, thanks to revolutionary treatments, a person with HIV can expect to live almost as long as someone without the virus. By the 2040s, new innovations could virtually eliminate deaths from HIV/AIDS.

Budget cuts limit how many people benefit from lifesaving tools, as we saw to devastating effect last year. But nothing can erase the fact that for decades we didn’t know how to save people from HIV, and now we do.

Breakthroughs are a bell that cannot be unrung. They ensure that we will never go back to the world in 2000 where over 10 million children died from preventable causes every year—and they form the core of my optimism about where the world is headed.

But as I mentioned, there are footnotes to my optimism. Although the innovation pipeline sets us up for long-term success, the trajectory of progress hinges on how the world addresses three key questions.

1. Will a world that is getting richer increase its generosity toward those in need?

The “golden rule” precept is more important now than ever with the record disparities in wealth. This idea of treating others as you wish to be treated does not just apply to rich countries giving aid. It must also include philanthropy from the wealthy to help those in need—both domestically and globally—which should grow rapidly in a world with a record number of billionaires and even centibillionaires.

Through the Giving Pledge, I get to work with a number of incredible philanthropists who set a great example by giving away substantial portions of their wealth in smart ways. However, more needs to be done to encourage higher levels of generosity from the rich and to show how fulfilling and impactful it can be.

More needs to be done to encourage higher levels of generosity from the rich and to show how fulfilling and impactful it can be.

Turning to aid budgets for poor countries, I am worried about one number: If funding for health decreases by 20 percent, 12 million more children could die by 2045. I know cuts won’t be reversed overnight, even though aid represented less than 1 percent of GDP even in the most generous countries. But it is critical that we restore some of the funding. The foundation’s Goalkeepers report lays out what is at risk and how the world can best spend the aid it gives.

I will spend much of my year working with partners to advocate for increased funding for the health of the world’s children. I plan to engage with a number of communities, including health care workers, religious groups, and members of diaspora communities to help make this case.

2. Will the world prioritize scaling innovations that improve equality?

Some problems require doing far more than just letting market incentives take their course.

The first critical area is climate change. Without a large global carbon tax (which is, unfortunately, politically unachievable), market forces do not properly incentivize the creation of technologies to reduce climate-related emissions.

Yet only by replacing all emitting activities with cheaper alternatives will we stop the temperature increase. This is why I started Breakthrough Energy 10 years ago and why I will continue to put billions into innovation.

The world has made meaningful progress in the last decade, cutting projected emissions by more than 40 percent. But we still have a lot of innovation and scaling up to do in tough areas like industrial emissions and aviation. Government policies in rich countries are still critical because unless innovations reach scale, the costs won’t come down and we won’t achieve the impact we need.

If we don’t limit climate change, it will join poverty and infectious disease in causing enormous suffering, especially for the world’s poorest people.

Since even in the best case the temperature will continue to go up, we also need to innovate to minimize the negative impacts.

This is called climate adaptation, and a critical example is helping farmers in poor countries with better seeds and better advice so they can grow more even in the face of climate change. Using AI, we will soon be able to provide poor farmers with better advice about weather, prices, crop diseases, and soil than even the richest farmers get today.

The foundation has committed $1.4 billion to supporting farmers on the frontlines of extreme weather.

I will be investing and giving more than ever to climate work in the years ahead while also continuing to give more to children’s health, the foundation’s top priority. The need to ensure money is spent on the most important priorities was the topic of a memo I wrote in the fall.

A second critical area where the world must focus on innovation-driven equality is health care.

Concerns about healthcare costs and quality are higher than ever in all countries.

In theory, people should feel optimistic about the state of health care with the incredible pipeline of innovations. For example, a recent breakthrough in diagnosing Alzheimer’s will revolutionize how we test for—and ultimately prevent—this disease, saving billions of dollars in costs. (Funding Alzheimer’s research is a particular focus for me.)

There’s similar progress on obesity and cancer, as well as on problems in developing countries like malaria, TB, and malnutrition.

Despite so much progress, however, the cost and complexity of the system means very few people are satisfied with their care. I believe we can improve health care dramatically in all countries by using AI not only to accelerate the development of innovations but directly in the delivery of health care.

Like many of you, I already use AI to better understand my own health. Just imagine what will be possible as it improves and becomes available for every patient and provider. Always-available, high-quality medical advice will improve medicine by every measure.

We aren’t quite there yet—developers still have work to do on reliability and how we connect the AI to doctors and nurses so they are empowered to check and override the system.

But I’m optimistic we will soon begin to scale access globally. I am following this work so the Gates Foundation and partners can make sure this capability is available in the countries that need it most—where there aren’t enough medical personnel—at the same time it is available elsewhere.

We are already working on pilots and making sure that even relatively uncommon African languages are fully supported.

Governments will have to play a central role in leading the implementation of AI into their health systems.

This is another case where the market alone won’t and can’t provide the solution.

A third and final area I will mention briefly is education. AI gives us a chance for the kind of personalized learning to keep students motivated that we have dreamed of in the past. This is now a focus of the Gates Foundation’s spending on education, and I am hopeful it will be empowering to both teachers and students. I’ve seen this firsthand in New Jersey, and it will be game changing as we scale it for the world.

All three of these areas—climate, health, and education—can improve rapidly with the right government focus. This year I will spend a lot of time meeting with pioneers all over the world to see which countries are doing the best work so we can spread best practices.

3. Will we minimize negative disruptions caused by AI as it accelerates?

Of all the things humans have ever created, AI will change society the most. It will help solve many of our current problems while also bringing new challenges very different from past innovations.

When people in the AI space predict that AGI or fully humanoid robots will come soon and then those deadlines are missed, it creates the impression that these things will never happen. However, there is no upper limit on how intelligent AIs will get or on how good robots will get, and I believe the advances will not plateau before exceeding human levels.

The two big challenges in the next decade are use of AI by bad actors and disruption to the job market.

Both are real risks that we need to do a better job managing. We’ll need to be deliberate about how this technology is developed, governed, and deployed.

In 2015, I gave a TED talk warning that the world was not ready to handle a pandemic. If we had prepared properly for the Covid pandemic, the amount of human suffering would have been dramatically less. Today, an even greater risk than a naturally caused pandemic is that a non-government group will use open source AI tools to design a bioterrorism weapon.

We’ll need to be deliberate about how AI is developed, governed, and deployed.

The second challenge is job market disruption. AI capabilities will allow us to make far more goods and services with less labor. In a mathematical sense, we should be able to allocate these new capabilities in ways that benefit everyone. As AI delivers on its potential, we could reduce the work week or even decide there are some areas we don’t want to use AI in.

The effects of this disruption are hard to model. Sometimes, when a game-changing technology improves rapidly, it drives more demand at lower cost and, by making the world richer, increases demand in other areas. For example, AI makes software developers at least twice as efficient, which makes coding cheaper while also creating demand elasticity for code. (Computing is a good historical example where lower costs actually caused the overall market to grow.

)

Even with this complexity, the rate of improvement is already starting to be enough to disrupt job demand in areas like software development. Other areas like warehouse work or phone support are not quite there yet, but once the AIs become more capable, the job disruption will be more immediate.

We’re already starting to see the impact of AI on the job market, and I think this impact will grow over the next five years. Even if the transition takes longer than I expect, we should use 2026 to prepare ourselves for these changes—including which policies will best help spread the wealth and deal with the important role jobs play in our society.

Different political parties will likely suggest different approaches.

By including these footnotes, particularly the last one, some readers may find my continued optimism even more surprising. But as we start 2026, I remain optimistic about the days ahead because of two core human capabilities.

The first is our ability to anticipate problems and prepare for them, and therefore ensure that our new discoveries make all of us better off. The second is our capacity to care about each other. Throughout history, you can always find stories of people tending not just to themselves or their clan or their country but to the greater good.

Those two qualities—foresight and care—are what give me hope as the year begins. As long as we keep exercising those abilities, I believe the years ahead can be ones of real progress.





Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has written his annual letter for 2026, expressing a rare and “upsetting” shift in global progress. While maintaining long-term optimism, Gates revealed that a critical metric of human health has moved backward: child mortality. Gates noted that the trend will continue unless we make progress in restoring aid budgets.In his annual letter titled, “Optimism with footnotes”, Gates highlighted that for the first time since 2000, the number of deaths for children under the age of five increased, rising from 4.6 million in 2024 to 4.8 million in 2025. He also noted that while AI-driven innovation in health and climate is accelerating, the “trajectory of progress” is currently under threat by multiple factors: dwindling generosity, climate and health equality and AI disruptions.Gates remains confident that the “innovation pipeline” will eventually spark a new era of progress.","Gates: I believe the world will keep improving, but it is harder to see that today than it has been in a long time.

""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job. Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.

But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.
