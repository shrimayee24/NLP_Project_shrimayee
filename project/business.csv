PM Modi Targets Mamata, Declares 'Asli Poribortan' In Malda, Says Bengal Needs BJP For Development

KOLKATA/MALDA: PM Narendra Modi brought up the issue of recurring violence in Bengal's Murshidabad during his rally in neighbouring Malda district Saturday, specifying demographic imbalance and infiltration as the underlying causes.Murshidabad's Beldanga continued to see vandalism as highways and railway tracks were blocked for the second day in protest against continuing violence against Bengalis in Jharkhand and Bihar.""Infiltration is impacting local culture and language and riots in districts like Murshidabad and Malda are on the rise because of this. You have to break the nexus of infiltrators and those in office,"" Modi said at the rally, about 150km from the violence epicentre, adding ""demographic balance"" was being ""disturbed at a few places"".""Every developed nation is driving out infiltrators. It's essential in states like Bengal. But that's not possible as long as TMC is in office,"" he said, blaming ""TMC's syndicates"" for the mess. Modi blamed ""TMC's goons"" for attacks on media personnel in Beldanga. ""They have behaved indecently with a woman journalist. No one takes cognizance of women's plight in Bengal.""The PM moved on to BJP's pre-poll concerns, trying to assure Matuas and Namasudras the Constitution had given them the right to stay here.""CAA has given them full security,"" he said. BJP has faced internal dissent in the Matua belts of North 24 Parganas and Nadia, with party MPs and MLAs often speaking in different voices and the community hitting the streets to protest against their ""victimisation"" in SIR. TMC seniors, including CM Mamata Banerjee, have visited these areas to address concerns. A person from the community died this week, prompting his family to blame ""SIR worries"".Modi sought to portray TMC as a party of ""the cruel and corrupt"". ""They are Bengal's enemies. They are busy filling up their pockets,"" he said, adding TMC's days were numbered. He alluded to corruption allegations during flood relief, slamming TMC for ""looting even during a crisis"". ""Bengal will reach new heights by the ideals of Rishitulya Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay,"" he said. Modi's ""Bankim-da"" address in Parliament a few weeks ago had prompted Trinamool to allege Modi and BJP were ""culturally alien"" to Bengal.Modi inaugurated rail and road infrastructure projects worth Rs 3,250 crore after flagging off a Vande Bharat sleeper train linking Howrah and Kamakhya and four Amrit Bharat Express trains.He blamed TMC for lack of investment in industry and farmers, alleging this was fuelling migration, and said it was the only state where people were not allowed benefits of Ayushman Bharat.","PM Narendra Modi says Bengal needs BJP for development. He blames ""TMC's syndicates"" for violence in Bengal's Murshidabad. He also blames TMC for lack of investment in industry and farmers. Modi: TMC's days are numbered and they are Bengal's enemies.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126634247,imgsize-721811,width-400,resizemode-4/article-35.jpg"

What went against Thackerays

Another page was added to India’s political history on Friday, capturing the event that will echo through the corridors of power and serve as a reminder that even a slight strategic misstep can unravel a hold on power built over decades.Having first lost the father-founded Shiv Sena, Uddhav Thackeray has now ceded his last power citadel, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), a civic fortress once ruled unhindered by Bal Thackeray. In Asia's richest civic polls, the Thackeray ""brand"" of politics had one of its key equities missing. Hindutva.While Uddhav Thackeray never expressed hostility towards Hindutva, even after aligning with the Congress and Sharad Pawar’s NCP, he struggled to step into his father’s shoes in carrying the ideological banner, which Eknath Shinde wore on his sleeve after splitting the party in the 2023 rebellion.By contrast, Uddhav’s attempt to reset the party’s ideological compass by leaning heavily on Marathi manoos and regional pride, and to give it momentum by aligning with his estranged cousin Raj Thackeray, ultimately ended in a damp squib.The Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray) and Raj Thackeray's Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) combine had framed the BMC polls as a battle to “save the Marathi manoos” and Mumbai, projecting the contest as both an assertion of regional pride and a referendum on the Thackeray legacy.The reunion of Uddhav Thackeray and Raj Thackeray after nearly two decades was billed as an acid test for the Thackeray brand.While sections of the Marathi electorate did rally behind the cousins, the consolidation fell short of what was required to retain control of the civic body.The ‘save Marathis’ narrative appeared to have a limited electoral pull. The combine managed to hold on to pockets of south and central Mumbai and parts of the western and eastern suburbs, including Dadar-Mahim, Worli, Dindoshi, Bhandup, Vikhroli and Bandra East.However, it failed to make inroads into BJP-dominated constituencies such as Colaba, Bandra West, Andheri West, Borivli, and Dahisar. Political observers noted that a significant section of the city’s upwardly mobile Maharashtrian voters, particularly in the western suburbs, gravitated towards the BJP.The underperformance of Shiv Sena (UBT) was compounded by the MNS’s poor showing. The MNS ended up in single digits, dragging down the overall Thackeray tally and underlining the limits of the reunion’s electoral impact.In September, Uddhav Thackeray himself had described the BMC election as a decisive test. Sena (UBT) contested 163 seats, the MNS 53, while the BJP fielded candidates in 137 wards and Eknath Shinde’s Shiv Sena in 90.BJP-led Mahayuti crossed the halfway mark of 114 in the 227-member body, but not by much. BJP won 89 seats and Shinde's Shiv Sena 29 to gain a narrow lead. In effect, the BJP will need Eknath Shinde's backing for big decisions.The Uddhav-Raj Thackeray combine won 71 seats (Uddhav's Sena winning 65 and Raj Thackeray's MNS taking 6), retaining a large chunk of wards in the city's Marathi heartland.Although Sena (UBT) did receive backing from Muslim voters, with two candidates from the community winning, the support was far weaker than in the 2024 Lok Sabha and assembly elections, largely because the Congress was no longer part of the alliance.When Bal Thackeray founded the Shiv Sena in 1966, the party was not conceived as a Hindutva platform. Its political grammar was rooted firmly in Marathi identity and regional assertion. The Sena positioned itself as the voice of the Marathi manoos in an increasingly cosmopolitan Bombay, railing against perceived economic and cultural marginalisation.Its early campaigns focused on securing jobs for locals, resisting the dominance of South Indian migrants in the city’s clerical and industrial workforce, and asserting linguistic and cultural primacy. Hindu nationalism, at this stage, was peripheral rather than foundational.This began to change as India’s political landscape evolved in the late 1970s and 1980s. The slow erosion of Congress dominance, coupled with the rise of the BJP, altered the ideological marketplace.The mobilisation around the Ram Janmabhoomi movement created space for a more assertive Hindu political identity, particularly in urban centres. Bal Thackeray, a keen reader of political mood and mass sentiment, consciously pivoted to occupy this space.By the early 1990s, especially during the period surrounding the Babri Masjid movement, Hindutva had moved from the margins to the centre of the Sena’s politics. The party formally aligned with the BJP, and Bal Thackeray emerged as one of the most unapologetic and influential mass leaders of the Hindutva movement.Crucially, he did not abandon Marathi identity in this shift; instead, he layered Hindutva over Marathi asmita, fusing the two into a single, emotionally charged political narrative.This fusion proved potent. It gave the Shiv Sena ideological clarity, street-level mobilisation, and cross-community appeal within Mumbai’s Hindu electorate. Bal Thackeray did not inherit Hindutva as a founding principle; he evolved into it. His political success lay in recognising that Marathi pride alone had limits, and that when combined with Hindutva, it could be transformed into a durable and expansive political brand.Unlike his father, Uddhav Thackeray did not abandon Hindutva in one decisive moment. His departure was incremental and tactical, shaped more by political compulsion than ideological conviction. For much of his early political career, Uddhav remained within the broad Hindutva framework laid down by Bal Thackeray, often projecting himself as a custodian rather than an innovator of the Sena’s legacy.The first visible shift came after the 2019 Maharashtra assembly elections, when Uddhav broke with the BJP and stitched together an ""unlikely alliance"" with the Congress and the NCP.The formation of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government required ideological accommodation, and Hindutva, once the Sena’s most assertive plank, was deliberately softened. The rhetoric gave way to the language of governance, secular inclusivity and constitutionalism, signalling a recalibration rather than an outright rejection.This softening deepened during Uddhav’s tenure as chief minister. While he never publicly disowned Hindutva, he also stopped aggressively articulating it. Temple politics, street mobilisation, and confrontational cultural messaging, hallmarks of Bal Thackeray’s style, were conspicuously absent.Instead, Uddhav leaned into administrative legitimacy and coalition management, seeking to broaden the Sena’s appeal beyond its traditional base.However, this ideological dilution created a vacuum. The Sena’s core voters, long accustomed to ideological clarity, were left uncertain about what the party stood for. That ambiguity proved costly when Eknath Shinde split the party and openly reclaimed Hindutva as its defining identity.By positioning himself as the inheritor of Bal Thackeray’s ideological legacy, Shinde offered continuity at a moment when Uddhav appeared to be reimagining the Sena without fully replacing its ideological core.In the end, Uddhav’s deviation from Hindutva was not about renunciation but about subtraction without substitution. And in a political ecosystem built on legacy and emotional mobilisation, that proved to be a strategic miscalculation.The reunion of Uddhav Thackeray and Raj Thackeray ahead of the BMC polls was less a moment of sentiment and more an act of political necessity. For nearly two decades, the Thackeray cousins had travelled divergent paths, divided by personal rivalry and competing claims over the Marathi political space.But the BMC election altered the calculus. Having lost the Shiv Sena and facing a weakened organisational base, Uddhav Thackeray needed a fresh axis of mobilisation. Raj Thackeray, struggling with electoral irrelevance and a shrinking footprint, needed relevance. The reunion was thus driven by a convergence of weakness rather than shared resurgence.Together, they sought to revive the original Thackeray ""brand of politics"" that included Marathi manoos, regional pride, and cultural ownership of Mumbai.The pitch was deliberately crafted to bypass Hindutva and instead reclaim the emotional terrain of Marathi asmita, projecting the BMC polls as a fight to “save Mumbai” and protect Maharashtrian interests. The symbolism of the cousins sharing a platform after 20 years was meant to signal unity, closure, and a consolidated Marathi vote bank.Both the Thackerays, recalling the 1961 Samyukta Maharashtra movement in which their grandfather, late Prabodhankar Thackeray, participated, claimed that the BJP was planning to separate Mumbai from Maharashtra and merge it with Gujarat.Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, who led the BJP’s campaign, refuted the charge.Speaking in Nashik on January 11 and then again at Shivtirth in Mumbai the next day, Fadnavis made it a point to repeatedly refute these claims and ensured that Thackerays’ Mumbai and Marathi “” (pride) and “” (existence) card does not stick this time around.Thackerays’ arguments about growing unemployment and neglect of “son-of the soils” were counter-punched with a “Global Mumbai” narrative by Fadnavis. Also, BJP fielded over 90 Marathi candidates for the BMC and announced that the next mayor of BMC will be Marathi.The Thackerays' push for regional identity turned so intense that Thackeray mockingly referred to the BJP leader K Annamalai as “rasmalai” and questioned his standing to speak on issues related to Mumbai.Thackeray attacked Annamalai for suggesting that Mumbai is an “international city”. He also referred to his uncle Bal Thackeray's ""Hatao lungi, bajao pungi” slogan from the 1960s and 1970s.“One rasmalai came from Tamil Nadu… what is your connection to here? Hatao lungi, bajao pungi,” Thackeray said at a joint UBT–MNS rally in Mumbai.Additionally, Thackeray also said that he would “kick” people from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh out of Maharashtra if they “try to impose Hindi”.In July last year, the Thackeray brothers held an ""Awaz Marathicha"" rally to oppose what they called the state government's bid to ""impose"" Hindi over Maharashtra.""We have come together to stay together"", Uddhav Thackeray said while addressing the gathering.Raj Thackeray launched a veiled attack on Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and said the CM did what even Balasaheb Thackeray could not -- bring the two estranged brothers together.Thackerays also shared a hug at the joint rally after the Maharashtra government scrapped two Government Resolutions (GRs) to introduce Hindi as the third language.""The Maharashtra Government rolled back the decision on the three-language formula due to the strong unity shown by Marathi people. This decision was a precursor to the plan of separating Mumbai from Maharashtra,"" the MNS chief said with Uddhav seated on the stage.Attacking the BJP-led Mahayuti during his address, Raj Thackeray said: ""How did they suddenly bring in the imposition of Hindi without any discussion? For what purpose, and for whom? This is an injustice to young children. Without any consultation, you’re trying to force it upon us. You may rule the assembly - but we rule the streets.""However, the reunion came with structural limits. While it generated attention and nostalgia, it failed to translate into a city-wide electoral wave.The BMC verdict laid bare the limits of legacy politics in a city that has steadily changed its political expectations. The Thackerays managed to revive old memories and emotional connect through unity, rallies and a renewed push for Marathi identity, but nostalgia alone could not compensate for the absence of a clear and contemporary ideological anchor.Mumbai’s electorate has grown more aspirational and diverse, and it appears less willing to rally behind a single, narrow identity pitch.For Uddhav Thackeray, the defeat completed a slow political unravelling, from losing the father-founded Shiv Sena to ceding control of the civic institution that once symbolised Bal Thackeray’s unquestioned authority.For Raj Thackeray, the outcome reinforced the challenge of converting sharp rhetoric into electoral relevance. Their reunion sent a message of solidarity, but solidarity without organisational depth and ideological clarity fell short.Ultimately, the BMC result was not merely about seats or numbers. It signalled a deeper shift in Mumbai’s politics, where legacy and sentiment must now contend with a demand for sharper purpose and direction.","BJP-Alliance Sweeps BMC Polls, Thackeray Reunion Flops; Rahul Slams EC Over ‘Ink Mark’ Row. Uddhav's attempt to reset the party’s ideological compass by leaning heavily on Marathi manoos and regional pride, and to give it momentum, ultimately ended in a damp squib.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126610578,imgsize-93756,width-400,resizemode-4/thackeray-cousins.jpg"

NEW DELHI: India has stepped up diplomatic engagement with Iran seeking consular access and early resolution for the case of 16 Indian crew members on board a merchant vessel detained by Iranian authorities in December last year, the Indian embassy in Tehran said.In a press release on Saturday, the embassy said it was informed around mid-December 2025 about the detention of MT Valiant Roar. The Consulate of India in Bandar Abbas wrote to the Iranian government on December 14 seeking consular access to the crew and has since followed up through diplomatic correspondence and in-person meetings in Bandar Abbas and Tehran, including at the level of the ambassador.“The Iranian authorities were also requested to allow the crew to communicate with their families in India,” the embassy said.The mission said it contacted the UAE-based ship-owning company on December 15 and has remained in touch with its Iran-based agents to ensure food, water and fuel supplies for the vessel, besides pressing for legal representation for the crew in Iranian courts. After being informed of depleting provisions, the mission intervened with the Iranian navy, which arranged emergency food and water supplies in early January.The Indian consulate in Dubai has also been engaging the ship-owning company to ensure regular provisioning and legal support, the embassy said, adding that the case is expected to go through Iran’s judicial process.“However, the Mission and the Consulate continue to press the Iranian authorities to grant early consular access to the crew, and to ensure expeditious completion of the judicial proceedings,” the statement said.Earlier in the day, the father of one of the detained crew members appealed to Indian authorities for urgent intervention. Mukesh Mehta said his son Ketan, a third engineer on board the tanker operated by Prime Tanker LLC, Dubai, was among those detained after the vessel was intercepted at Bandar Abbas port, reported PTI.He said the family has been living in constant anxiety since learning of the detention and appealed to the government, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the ministry of external affairs and the Directorate General of Shipping to take immediate diplomatic steps to secure the crew’s release.Iran on December 13 had seized an oil tanker in the Gulf of Oman, claiming it was carrying six million litres of diesel fuel and had 16 crew members from India on board.Iran has frequently announced the boarding of vessels it accuses of illegally transporting fuel, citing smuggling concerns amid low domestic fuel prices. Authorities have denied that such seizures are retaliatory actions against other countries.The Gulf of Oman and the Strait of Hormuz remain critical maritime chokepoints, handling nearly 20 per cent of global oil trade, with heightened tensions continuing amid increased regional naval activity and geopolitical friction.","India has stepped up diplomatic engagement with Iran seeking consular access and early resolution for the case of 16 Indian crew members detained by Iranian authorities.

Experts warn: Mass removal of stray dogs could backfire on public health,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/experts-warn-mass-removal-of-stray-dogs-could-backfire-on-public-health/articleshow/126556050.cms,"Image: IANS

Free-living dogs form stable social groups when food sources, sterilisation, and vaccination coverage remain consistent.

Large-scale removal disrupts these systems, creating territorial vacuums that are rapidly filled by other dogs -- often unvaccinated and unsterilised -- an effect associated with increased dog-bite incidents and heightened disease risk.

Mass removal undermines rabies control by dismantling herd immunity. India’s existing Catch-Neuter-Vaccinate-Release (CNVR) framework, when implemented consistently, targets the internationally recognised threshold of vaccinating at least 70% of dogs in a given area.

Data show steep declines in human rabies deaths and dog-bite incidence in areas with sustained sterilisation and vaccination programmes. Abandoning this approach risks reversing hard-earned gains achieved over past two decades.

Mass sheltering, experts argue, compounds the risks. High-density animal housing is globally classified as a biohazard activity, requiring stringent quarantine, disease surveillance, and worker-safety protocols.

Supreme Court Directs Dogs Be Shifted From Schools, Bus Stands To Shelters; Petitioner Breaks Down

A coalition of multisectoral experts from a range of global institutions has lent its weight to petitioners in the stray dog case being heard in Supreme Court. The coalition warned that authorities’ proposals to remove and mass-shelter India’s free-living community dogs could undermine public health, go beyond the law, destabilise urban ecosystems and impose enormous fiscal costs, without delivering greater public safety.The cautionary note draws on experience of veterans in public health, behavioural science, veterinary medicine and law. Signatories include Chinny Krishna who pioneered India’s Animal Birth Control programme, evolutionary biologist Lee Dugatkin (University of Louisville, US), Anindita Bhadra of IISER Kolkata, public health expert Leena Menghaney, Pushpinder Singh Khera of AIIMS Jodhpur, and Julie Corfmat of Mission Rabies among a host of others. Organisations include International Companion Animal Network (ICAN), Pet Dog Trainers of Europe (PDTE), International Institute for Canine Ethics (IICE) and Bangalore Hundeskole Academy for Research and Canine Studies (BHARCS). Highlights of their analysis:Dugatkin noted claims justifying removal often rest on myths rather than biology. “These dogs have coexisted with humans in India for millennia. Disrupting stable populations based on fear or misinformation ignores everything we know about animal behaviour and disease ecology,” he said.Anthrozoologist Sindhoor Pangal said the debate had become detached from evidence. “Replacing proven, low-cost public-health systems with a mass-detention model is not just unscientific -- it actively increases risk while draining resources that should be strengthening vaccination and disease prevention,” she said.Position statements from IICE highlight that large shelters frequently experience overcrowding, stress-induced immunosuppression, and rapid disease transmission, particularly where enforcement capacity is limited.Free-living dogs play a role in urban ecosystems by scavenging waste and limiting proliferation of rats and other scavengers that can’t be vaccinated or monitored. Sudden dog removal can lead to rodent population explosions linked to diseases such as leptospirosis and plague.Legal experts point out that mass relocation directly contradicts the Animal Birth Control (Dog) Rules, 2023, which mandate sterilisation, vaccination, and return to the original territory. Large-scale confinement also raises constitutional and labour-safety concerns, given occupational hazards associated with mass animal housing.","A coalition of multisectoral experts from a range of global institutions has lent its weight to petitioners in the stray dog case being heard in Supreme Court. The coalition warned that authorities’ proposals to remove and mass- shelter India’s free-living community dogs could undermine public health, go beyond the law and destabilise urban ecosystems.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126556091,imgsize-1095608,width-400,resizemode-4/image-ians.jpg"

Big relief for Punjab's farmers as Centre has agreed to shift border fence closer to IB: CM Mann,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/big-relief-for-punjabs-farmers-as-centre-has-agreed-to-shift-border-fence-closer-to-ib-cm-mann/articleshow/126617513.cms,"NEW DELHI: Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann on Saturday claimed a major relief for farmers in the state's border belt after the Centre agreed in principle to shift the security fence closer to the International Border.Mann, after his meeting with Union home minister Amit Shah, said the move will clear the way for unhindered cultivation of thousands of acres of farmland currently trapped beyond the fencing.The Punjab chief minister said farmers have long been forced to cross the fence with identity cards and under BSF escort to reach their own fields, facing daily hardship and uncertainty along the 532-km-long India-Pakistan border, where fencing lies deep inside Punjab's territory.He said the home minister informed him during the meeting that the issue is under active consideration and that the fencing will be shifted towards the border, bringing Punjab's land back on the accessible side without compromising national security.Alongside the border issue, CM Mann also raised a series of long-pending concerns, including Punjab's objections to the proposed Seeds Bill 2025, the unresolved Sutlej Yamuna Link (SYL) dispute, slow movement of foodgrains by the FCI, freezing of Arthia commission, non-payment of rural development fund (RDF) and Mandi Fund, and the dilution of Punjab's role in Chandigarh's administration.He sought a prompt and time-bound resolution of these matters.Raising objections to the proposed Seeds Bill 2025, Mann said, ""Punjab is an agrarian state and one of the largest grain-producing states of the country, yet the draft Seed Bill does not assure representation of the state as per schedule under the relevant section.""The zone-based system introduced in the Bill does not guarantee Punjab's representation in the central seed committee, unlike the existing system, thereby limiting the state's voice in decisions that directly affect the seed sector.""The Punjab CM added, ""The proposed Bill also curtails the existing powers of the state seed committee, as there is no role envisaged for the state-level committee in seed registration, and the draft is silent on a robust compensation framework for farmers who suffer losses when registered seed fails to perform as claimed.""The chief minister further pointed out that seed varieties tested and released in foreign countries have been allowed for import and sale in Punjab and other states without compulsory multi-location testing under state-specific agro climatic conditions, posing serious risks to farmers.He conveyed to the home minister that agriculture is Punjab's lifeline, where farmers grow crops, sell part of the produce and retain seeds for the next season, and forcing farmers to depend entirely on companies for seeds is neither practical nor in farmers' interest.He said that the Bill should not be brought before Parliament in its present form, and was assured by the Union home minister that the concerns would be examined.Reiterating Punjab's long-standing position on river waters, the chief minister said, ""Punjab has no surplus water to share with any other state. There has been a substantial reduction in the availability of Satlej, Ravi and Beas waters, and therefore construction of the Satlej Yamuna Link canal is not viable.""He said that out of 34.34 Mean Annual Flow (MAF) of water from these rivers, Punjab was allocated only 14.22 MAF, about 40 per cent, while the remaining 60 per cent was allocated to Haryana, Delhi and Rajasthan, even though none of these rivers actually flow through those states.""This is a gross injustice with Punjab, and there is absolutely no question of constructing this canal as it is totally against the interests of the state and its people,"" he asserted, adding that Punjab's stand before the Supreme Court remains firm that there is no water to spare.Highlighting the problem of foodgrain movement and storage, the chief minister said, ""For the last five months, the FCI has been moving only about 4 to 5 lakh metric tonnes of wheat and 5 to 6 LMT of rice from Punjab. Against 95 LMT of pending rice of Kharif marketing season 2025-26 to be delivered, only 20 LMT of storage space is currently available.""On the issue of Arthia commission, CM Mann said, ""The Arthia Commission has been frozen since the 2019-20 procurement season, contrary to the provisions of The Punjab Agriculture Produce and Marketing Act 1961.""Flagging the non-payment of statutory dues, the chief minister said, ""Despite clear statutory provisions under the relevant Punjab Acts, RDF has not been reimbursed to the state government. Even after amending the Punjab Rural Development Act in compliance with Government of India instructions, RDF has not been released since KMS 2021-22.""","The Centre agreed in principle to shift the security fence closer to the International Border. Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann said the move will clear the way for unhindered cultivation of thousands of acres of farmland currently trapped beyond the fencing.

Infrastructure as a catalyst for industrial growth

‘India Outperforming Emerging Markets’: Economist On India's 7.4% FY26 GDP Growth Estimates

Translating policy intent into global manufacturing competitiveness

(Arnab Basu is Partner and Chief Industries Officer, PwC India)

As India advances towards achieving the government’s vision of Viksit Bharat, Budget 2026 arrives at a poignant moment in the country’s economic journey. Over the past decade, public policy has laid strong structural foundations through reforms, infrastructure expansion and a renewed focus on domestic manufacturing which has collectively reshaped India’s growth trajectory. The task before the upcoming Budget is not to reset direction, but to consolidate gains, deepen execution and ensure that public investment continues to crowd in private capital at scale.At the heart of this agenda lies infrastructure. Sustained public CapEx has been one of the most defining features of recent budgets, supporting growth even amid global uncertainty. Investments in roads, railways, ports, airports and digital infrastructure have improved connectivity, reduced logistics costs and strengthened India’s competitiveness across sectors.The Union Budget FY26 has the opportunity to build further on this momentum by continuing a high level of CapEx allocation, while sharpening focus on project execution, asset monetisation and state-level capacity building. The next phase of infrastructure growth must prioritise outcomes related to productivity gains, faster completion cycles, and stronger linkages between physical and digital networks.Equally important is the role of infrastructure in enabling India’s manufacturing ambitions. The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes, announced over successive Budgets, have begun to yield tangible results across electronics, pharmaceuticals, automotive components and renewable energy equipment. As India seeks to position itself as a trusted manufacturing partner in global value chains, this year’s Budget can focus on refining these schemes—shifting from capacity creation to deeper supply-chain integration, technology adoption and MSME participation. Simplifying compliance, improving access to long-term finance, and strengthening industrial clusters will be critical to sustaining manufacturing competitiveness beyond initial incentives.The manufacturing opportunity in India is both cyclical and structural. While geopolitical realignments and supply-chain diversification are creating near-term openings, domestic demand, urbanisation, and rising incomes provide a long-term anchor. Policy continuity will therefore be key. Measures such as stable customs regimes, faster approvals, and coordinated centre-state frameworks can reinforce investor confidence. Targeted investments in logistics parks, warehousing and multimodal transport can further reduce the cost of manufacturing and exports which has been a long-standing constraint for India’s manufacturing industry.While infrastructure and manufacturing form the core of Budget expectations, the role of technology (especially AI) cannot be overlooked. AI is increasingly becoming a horizontal enabler, enhancing productivity in design, operations, maintenance and supply chain planning across infrastructure and industrial sectors. Budget 2026 can support this transition through targeted incentives for digital adoption, investments in data infrastructure, and skilling programmes that prepare the workforce for technology-enabled manufacturing. The focus should be on practical application rather than experimentation alone, ensuring that AI investments translate into measurable productivity gains.Skilling and human capital development remain another critical lever. Large-scale infrastructure and manufacturing expansion will require a workforce equipped with both technical and digital skills. Building on initiatives such as Skill India and recent efforts to align skilling with industry needs, the Budget can further strengthen public-private partnerships in vocational training, apprenticeships, and continuous upskilling. Ensuring that India’s demographic dividend is absorbed into these sectors will be central to achieving inclusive and sustainable development.From an investor's perspective, policy predictability and fiscal discipline will be crucial. In the past, India has demonstrated that growth-oriented spending can coexist with a credible fiscal consolidation path and the Union Budget FY26 will have to continue this balancing act by maintaining CapEx while managing deficits and debt prudently. According to PwC’s 28th Annual Global CEO Survey: India Perspective, a majority of Indian CEOs remain confident about the country’s economic growth, underpinned by reform stability and sustained public investment. Preserving this confidence will depend on the Budget’s ability to reinforce continuity while addressing emerging execution challenges.Beyond numbers and allocations, this year’s budget will be read as a signal of intent. For global investors, it will indicate how firmly India is committed to strengthening its role in global manufacturing and infrastructure-led growth. For the domestic industry, it will shape decisions on capacity expansion, technology adoption, and long-term investment, while for the states, it will define the contours of cooperative federalism in delivering large-scale projects.The Union Budget FY26 represents an opportunity to reinforce the foundations of Viksit Bharat through steady, purposeful policy action. By sustaining infrastructure investment, deepening manufacturing capabilities and enabling technology-led productivity, the Budget can help ensure that India’s growth story remains resilient and inclusive. As the economy navigates an evolving global landscape, it is this consistency of direction and execution that will preserve momentum and translate ambition into enduring economic outcomes.","At the heart of this agenda lies infrastructure. Sustained public CapEx has been one of the most defining features of recent budgets. The next phase of infrastructure growth must prioritise outcomes related to productivity gains, faster completion cycles, and stronger linkages between physical and digital networks.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126585586,imgsize-57460,width-400,resizemode-4/budget-2026-expectations.jpg"

Budget 2026: Will tax provisions ease for crypto assets?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-will-tax-provisions-ease-for-crypto-assets/articleshow/126525033.cms,"Losses from VDAs cannot be set off — not against other income, nor even against gains from another crypto asset.

Key concerns flagged:

Crypto’s anonymous, borderless and near-instant transfers make tracking taxable income and beneficial ownership difficult for tax authorities.

Use of offshore exchanges, private wallets, and decentralised platforms complicates enforcement and obscures transaction trails, hindering accurate tax assessment and recovery.

Jurisdictional limitations add to the challenge, as many transactions occur outside India’s regulatory reach, making compliance and enforcement “virtually impossible.”

A tax framework that bites:

Non-residents and the unresolved ‘situs’ question:

Reporting income from VDAs:

Suggestions for

Budget 2026

:

Allowing set-off of losses between different VDAs, even if not against other income

Providing statutory guidance on the situs of VDAs, especially for non-residents

Reviewing the impact of 1% TDS on market liquidity

The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has raised fresh concerns about the risks posed by virtual digital assets (VDAs) such as cryptocurrencies, aligning its stance with that of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).The tax department’s warning presented recently to a Parliamentary Standing Committee of Finance underscores regulatory agencies' growing scepticism about cryptocurrencies fit within India’s financial and taxation framework. It highlights revenue risks, enforcement gaps and potential misuse for evasion or illicit finance.The tax regime in India, for VDAs can be considered as one of the most stringent in the world.The Finance Act, 2022, ushered in a bespoke tax regime for VDAs by inserting section 115-BBH into the Income-tax Act, 1961 (I-T Act). Income from the transfer of VDAs is taxed at a flat 30%, plus surcharge and cess, regardless of the holding period. The law allows only the cost of acquisition as a deduction, barring transaction fees, exchange charges or other expenses.More critically, losses from VDAs cannot be set off — not against other income, nor even against gains from another crypto asset.Losses also cannot be carried forward. A parallel provision mandates 1% tax deduction at source (TDS) on transfers beyond specified thresholds, further tightening liquidity. To illustrate: For a salaried individual, a 1% TDS is applicable on transfer of the VDAs if the transaction amount exceeds ­10,000.Various associations have in their pre budget submissions, argued that disallowing set-off of losses between VDAs is economically distortive and ultimately counterproductive for tax revenues.The argument is simple: when losses are ring-fenced, but gains are fully taxed, risk-taking is penalised asymmetrically. This has reportedly contributed to trading volumes migrating offshore, exchanges shifting operations overseas and Indian investors being pushed into cross-border structures that raise FEMA and compliance complexities.The result is a tax structure that treats crypto trading far more harshly than equities, real estate or even speculative assets, despite its growing mainstream adoption.While section 115-BBH of the I-T Act, applies equally to residents and non-residents, tax provisions are not clear on a crucial issue: where is a VDA located? For non-residents, taxability hinges on whether income accrues or arises in India (the provisions of sections 5 and 9 of the I-T Act and the relevant tax treaty provisions come into play).Unlike shares or immovable property, VDAs lack a clearly identifiable physical or legal location. In the absence of legislative clarity on the situs of crypto assets, non-resident taxation risks becoming a fertile ground for disputes particularly where trading occurs on global exchanges, assets are held in offshore wallets and sale proceeds are received outside India.Experts point out that clarity is essential to avoid avoidable litigation. Jurisdictions such as the UK offer guidance by linking the situs of crypto assets to the residential status of the beneficial owner, an approach India could adapt.Individuals dealing in cryptocurrencies are required to disclose income from virtual digital assets in Schedule VDA of their annual income tax returns — typically ITR-2 or ITR-3, depending on their income profile. The schedule seeks granular information, including the date of acquisition and transfer, cost of acquisition and sale consideration. Accurate reporting is crucial, as any under-reporting or misreporting of VDA income can attract penalties, apart from interest on unpaid tax.Possible reforms being discussed in policy circles include:Ashish Singhal, Co-founder, CoinSwitch said, ""India’s VDA ecosystem is at a pivotal stage, with growing adoption across the country. However, the current tax framework presents challenges for retail participants by taxing transactions without recognising losses, creating friction rather than fairness. A reduction in TDS on VDA transactions from 1% to 0.01% could improve liquidity, ease compliance, and enhance transparency while preserving transaction traceability. Raising the TDS threshold to ₹5 lakh would help protect small investors from disproportionate impact.""""Introduced in 2022 as a stand-in for regulation at that time, VDA taxation has since been complemented by strong oversight from FIU-IND and improved compliance. This Budget presents a great opportunity to revisit the framework in a manner beneficial to both investors and the government. We remain hopeful that the government will recognize this gap and consider reviewing the current framework soon,"" he concluded.","Crypto’s anonymous, borderless and near-instant transfers make tracking taxable income and beneficial ownership difficult for tax authorities.

Pune Municipal Corporation: 52/162 seats

Nagpur Municipal Corporation: 85/151 seats

Navi Mumbai (NMMC): 42/67 seats

2. The Thackeray legacy and failed reunion

3. Pawar play fizzles out

4. AIMIM makes inroads in urban pockets

5. Hope for Congress

(With agency inputs)

NEW DELHI: The Maharashtra civic elections 2026, including the high-stakes Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) polls, delivered a resounding verdict to the BJP-led Mahayuti. Across 27 civic bodies and 2,869 wards, results show the BJP-led Mahayuti alliance decisively ahead, as the party and its partners captured key urban strongholds.Meanwhile, smaller players made targeted gains and traditionally dominant regional parties struggled to counter a robust campaign narrative focused on governance.The most striking outcome of the civic polls is the BJP ’s dominance, under the strategic leadership of Devendra Fadnavis. In the BMC, India’s richest municipal corporation, the BJP is on track to secure around 90 wards, compared with just 82 in 2017.When combined with alliance partners, the Mahayuti tally comfortably surpasses the 114 seats needed for a majority, currently projected at 140+ BMC wards. The BJP also leads major urban bodies:The outcome validates the ""triple engine"" narrative the BJP has pushed under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Analysts attribute the BJP-led Mahayuti’s march past the 100-seat mark to one overriding factor: a deeply fragmented opposition that converted the contest into a patchwork of “friendly fights” and multi-cornered battles. The sharpest splits emerged in the traditional Marathi heartland. Although the Shiv Sena (UBT) and the MNS stitched together a tactical understanding, they faced competition not only from the BJP but also from the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena . In more than 80 wards, the two Sena factions were locked in direct contests, effectively dividing the same “bow and arrow” legacy vote.The Congress ’s decision to stay out of the Sena (UBT)–MNS arrangement compounded the problem. By contesting independently in an attempt to consolidate minority and Dalit voters, the party instead triggered a three-way split in what observers described as the secular vote. In several areas, Congress candidates, along with those from the VBA and the Samajwadi Party, played a spoiler role that hurt Sena (UBT) more than the Mahayuti.This splintering meant that anti-Mahayuti sentiment never coalesced into a decisive bloc. Reports pointed to at least 15 instances of “friendly fights” where opposition or anti-BJP parties fielded candidates against one another. The internal rivalries not only confused voters but also drained organisational energy and resources, leaving the Opposition poorly positioned to mount a unified challenge to the BJP.The results underline a decisive realignment in Mumbai’s civic politics. The BJP, which for decades played second fiddle during the undivided Shiv Sena’s long reign over the BMC, has now emerged as the dominant force, aided by the Eknath Shinde-led Sena faction that broke away in 2022.The undivided Shiv Sena had controlled the 227-member BMC almost continuously since the late 1990s, making the civic body the cornerstone of its political and organisational power. For the Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena (UBT), the latest outcome marks its weakest showing in the corporation in more than 20 years, signalling a sharp erosion of its once-formidable urban base.Trends suggest that while the broader “Thackeray brand” retained limited resonance with voters, it was not enough to arrest the party’s decline. The results have also cast a spotlight on the future of the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), with questions mounting over Raj Thackeray’s political viability as his appeal failed to translate into significant electoral gains.Historically, the Shiv Sena, founded by Bal Thackeray, first captured the BMC in 1997, winning 103 seats and unseating the Congress, which secured 49. The BJP then won 26 seats, while the Samajwadi Party emerged victorious in 21 wards. In the 2017 polls, the undivided Sena had remained the single largest party with 84 seats, narrowly ahead of the BJP’s 82, while Congress won 31, the NCP nine, the MNS seven and the Samajwadi Party six. Although the BJP and Shiv Sena were allies, they had contested separately and stitched together an alliance after the results.In contrast, the current elections saw the Shiv Sena (UBT) and the MNS contest together in an effort to consolidate the Marathi vote amid a fractured Sena legacy. That strategy failed to hold Uddhav Thackeray’s traditional civic bastion.Political observers say the verdict reflects a fundamental shift in Mumbai’s civic power structure, with influence moving away from the Uddhav Thackeray-led Sena and the BJP significantly expanding its footprint in the country’s financial capital.Ajit Pawar’s bid to revive the Nationalist Congress Party’s urban strongholds through a late “family reunion” with the Nationalist Congress Party (SP) fell flat in the 2026 civic polls, as the Bharatiya Janata Party swept Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad.Seeking to blunt the BJP’s challenge in his traditional bastions, Ajit Pawar forged an alliance with his uncle Sharad Pawar’s faction and ran an unusually confrontational campaign against his own state-level ally. He accused the BJP’s local leadership of stalled development and corruption, and personally targeted Union minister and Pune MP Murlidhar Mohol, as well as Pimpri-Chinchwad MLA Mahesh Landge.The strategy did not work. Live trends showed the BJP leading decisively in both cities: over 110 seats in Pune, compared with the NCP’s 12 and NCP (SP)’s two, and 84 seats in Pimpri-Chinchwad against the NCP’s 37. The outcome significantly weakens Ajit Pawar’s bargaining power within the BJP-led Mahayuti alliance.Compounding the setback, Sharad Pawar remained largely absent from the campaign, as did Baramati MP Supriya Sule, blunting the optics of reconciliation. Ajit Pawar’s manifesto promises, including free Metro and bus rides and property tax relief for small homes, were ridiculed by BJP leaders as unrealistic.The polls, held after an eight-year gap, were also fought amid scrutiny of the Mundhwa land deal involving Ajit Pawar’s son, Parth Pawar. Together, the results underscore the limits of factional reunions without organisational unity or voter trust.One of the notable surprises of the 2026 civic results was the performance of the All India Majlis‑e‑Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM).AIMIM has won or is leading in over 90 seats, performing better that regional parties like Raj Thackeray's MNS and Sharad Pawar's NCP.While AIMIM’s overall tally remains modest compared to the Mahayuti or traditional Congress vote banks, the party’s strategic gains have reshaped local arithmetic in several wards. In tightly contested seats, their presence appears to have split opposition votes, inadvertently aiding Mahayuti victories.For the Indian National Congress, the civic polls were mostly disappointing, but not uniformly so.The party decided to enter the contest solo after the Thackeray cousins reunited. While it was at No. 4 in BMC with 23 seats, the party managed to get third spot overall in the state with over 300 votes.The party's performed better in the state compared to its Maha Vikas Agadi allies Shiv Shiv Sena (UBT) and NCP (SP).While it might not be enough, this little resurgence might provide the motivation the party needs for the upcoming state elections.","The Maharashtra civic elections 2026 delivered a resounding verdict to the BJP- led Mahayuti. Results underline a decisive realignment in Mumbai’s civic politics.

India has a river that flows backwards: Know which river it is,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/travel/india-has-a-river-that-flows-backwards-know-which-river-it-is/articleshow/126525975.cms,"The Narmada river flows in the opposite direction and here’s why

The origin of the Narmada River

The reason why the Narmada flow westwards

What landscapes does the river support

Dams and projects that lie on the river

Natural sites found along the Narmada

Narmada and its importance for faith and culture





India’s river systems are usually described as following a clear pattern. Most major rivers rise in the Himalayas or the central highlands and travel eastward to the Bay of Bengal, a rule taught early in geography lessons and seldom challenged. Yet one notable river defies this logic. Flowing westward across the subcontinent, it reshapes landscapes, livelihoods, and belief systems along its course. Far from obscure or insignificant, this river is long, deeply revered, and extensively studied, though its direction often surprises first-time learners. The Narmada stands apart not for its size or speed alone, but because its westward journey is dictated by geology rather than convention.The river that flows westward rather than east is the Narmada. Stretching for about 1,310 kilometres, it is India’s fifth-longest river. Unlike rivers such as the Ganga or the Godavari, the Narmada does not empty into the Bay of Bengal. From its source, it follows a consistent westward course before finally draining into the Arabian Sea. Very few major Indian rivers take this route, with the Tapi being another notable example.The perception of the Narmada flowing “backwards” arises only because most rivers in the region flow in the opposite direction.The Narmada begins at Amarkantak in Madhya Pradesh. The area is forested and also known as a place of pilgrimage. From here, the river starts moving west. It passes through Madhya Pradesh, briefly touches Maharashtra, and then enters Gujarat. Its journey ends near Bharuch, where it reaches the Arabian Sea. Along the way, the river then changes character. While in some places, it cuts through hills and narrow valleys, in other places, it opens out and slows down. The upper stretches feel remote, while the lower ones feel settled.Geology shapes the Narmada's flow direction. It flows across a rift valley caused by previous tectonic action. The valley slopes east to west. Water follows the slope. The Vindhya Range sits to the north of the basin, while the Satpura Range extends to the south. Because the river passes through this gap, it behaves differently than many others. It does not form a wide delta. Instead, it creates an estuary where it joins the sea.The Narmada basin covers varied terrain. The upper areas are hilly and forested, with fewer people living nearby. Further west, the land becomes flatter and more open. These plains are fertile. Farming depends heavily on the river here. Crops such as wheat, pulses, and cotton are common. The river also supplies drinking water. Over time, canals and reservoirs have extended its reach. Towns and cities along the river rely on it in quiet, everyday ways.Several large dams have been built along the Narmada. The Sardar Sarovar Dam in Gujarat is the most widely known. Others include the Indira Sagar Dam and the Omkareshwar Dam in Madhya Pradesh. These projects generate electricity and supply water for farming and households. They have also changed how the river flows. Over the years, they have been linked to debates about land, displacement, and environmental impact. These discussions continue.The river is also associated with well known natural features. Near Jabalpur, it passes between tall marble cliffs known as the Marble Rocks. Close by, the Dhuandhar Falls send water crashing down in a thick spray, especially during the monsoon. These places are not vast, but they leave an impression. The river here feels contained. The sound carries. The landscape holds it in place.For numerous individuals, the Narmada signifies more than merely a river. Temples in Maheshwar, Omkareshwar, and Amarkantak attract pilgrims year-round. Some individuals undertake the Narmada Parikrama, an extensive pilgrimage along its banks. The river is regarded as a living entity. Its trajectory has remained consistent across generations. Throughout its extent, faith, establishment, and customary practices persist in expanding around it.","The Narmada is India’s fifth-longest river, stretching for 1,310 kilometres.

Smaller nations perform at rank six

The United Kingdom appears at rank seven

Canada at rank eight

Malaysia reach the top nine

The United States at rank ten





Passports are often treated as background documents, noticed only at airports or borders. Yet their strength shapes how easily people can move across the world. Global passport rankings measure this strength by counting how many destinations can be entered without arranging a visa in advance. These include visa-free access, a visa on arrival, and electronic travel authorisation. The higher the number, the fewer barriers a traveller faces. In 2026, the latest Henley Passport Index reports again show a clear gap between the most powerful passports and the rest. The countries at the top benefit from long-standing diplomatic ties, economic stability, and reciprocal agreements.According to the Henley Passport Index ranking, India's passport has become slightly more powerful in 2026, albeit it is still not among the strongest in the world. While rising up to 80th rank, Indian visitors can now enter 55 countries without seeking for a visa in advance or receiving one upon arrival. For travellers, this ranking is about actual freedom more than reputation. They have an impact on cost, planning time, and the speed with which a voyage can be completed when the need or opportunity arises.Singapore holds the top position with access to 192 destinations.This marks its third consecutive year at number one. The passport’s strength reflects the country’s strong diplomatic reach and reputation for stability. While it lost visa-free access to a small number of countries over the past year, it gained entry to Papua New Guinea, keeping its overall score high. Singapore’s role as a financial and transport hub continues to support its global mobility.Japan and South Korea share second place with access to 188 destinations. Both countries have built extensive travel agreements over decades. Their passports benefit from trust built through trade, tourism, and political alignment with many regions. Although neither sits at the very top this year, they remain among the most flexible for short-notice international travel.Denmark, Luxembourg, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland occupy third place with scores of 186. These countries benefit from European Union agreements alongside separate bilateral arrangements. Their citizens can move easily within Europe and beyond. Stability, strong institutions, and consistent foreign policy help maintain this level of access year after year.Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Norway, and the Netherlands all rank fourth with access to 185 destinations. The grouping reflects similar travel privileges rather than shared geography alone. These passports offer broad reach across the Americas, Asia, and Africa, supported by long-established diplomatic networks.Hungary, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and the United Arab Emirates sit at rank five with 184 destinations. The UAE stands out as a newer entrant to the top tier, reflecting rapid diplomatic expansion. The European countries in this group continue to benefit from EU mobility and steady international relations.Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Malta, New Zealand, and Poland share sixth place with 183 destinations. These passports combine regional access with growing global reach. New Zealand’s inclusion highlights how geographic isolation does not prevent strong travel freedom when trust and agreements are in place.Australia, Latvia, Liechtenstein, and the United Kingdom rank seventh with 182 destinations. The UK remains high despite changes to its relationship with the European Union. Its passport still offers wide access, though the pace of expansion has slowed compared with earlier years.Canada joins Iceland and Lithuania at rank eight with access to 181 destinations. Canada’s position reflects steady, rather than growing, mobility. Its passport remains strong for leisure and business travel, even if it no longer leads the rankings.Malaysia ranks ninth with access to 180 destinations. It is the only Southeast Asian country in the top ten besides Singapore. Its passport strength reflects regional agreements and growing international ties, giving its holders broad travel options.The United States completes the top ten with connectivity to 179 destinations. Although still formidable, its passport has experienced a modest decline in recent years. Visa policy and reciprocity influence the landscape, positioning it slightly below several comparable nations in terms of global mobility.","Henley Passport Index 2026 reveals world's most powerful passports.

The government is likely to peg the fiscal deficit at 4.3 per cent of GDP in the next financial year beginning April 2026, while continuing with double-digit growth in capital expenditure, rating agency ICRA said in its pre-Budget expectations on Friday.ICRA said it expects a shortfall of about Rs 1.3 lakh crore in net tax revenues in the current fiscal, while non-tax receipts are likely to exceed the 2025-26 Budget target by around Rs 80,000 crore.“Fiscal slippage unlikely in FY2026, if shortfall in receipts is matched by expenditure savings,” it said.According to ICRA, the FY2027 Union Budget will be significant as the government’s focus is expected to shift towards medium-term debt consolidation rather than annual fiscal deficit targets, alongside the rollout of the 16th Finance Commission’s recommendations for the next five years.The agency expects the fiscal deficit to be capped at 4.3 per cent of GDP in FY2027, assuming nominal GDP growth of 9.8 per cent. This would be marginally lower than the Budget Estimate of 4.4 per cent for FY2026.ICRA said the government is likely to raise capital expenditure by 14 per cent to Rs 13.1 lakh crore in FY2027, before fiscal rigidities begin to intensify from FY2028 onwards due to higher committed expenditure linked to the recommendations of the 8th Central Pay Commission on salary and pension revisions for Central government employees and pensioners.Despite the expected moderation in the fiscal deficit-to-GDP ratio, the agency said gross dated market borrowings are projected to rise sharply by 15–16 per cent to Rs 16.9 lakh crore in FY2027. This increase would be driven mainly by higher redemptions, although it could be partly offset through switching of government securities, ICRA added.","ICRA said it expects a shortfall of about Rs 1.3 lakh crore in net tax revenues in the current fiscal.

BMC election results 2026: BJP trolls Raj Thackeray with 'rasmalai'; Annamalai says Mumbaikars chose substance over divisiveness,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bmc-election-results-2026-bengaluru-bjp-mp-trolls-raj-thackeray-with-rasmalai-mahayuti-sweeps-polls/articleshow/126563534.cms,"BMC Polls 2026: Inside Mumbai’s Civic Giant Whose Budget Is Bigger Than Many Indian States

NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MPs PC Mohan and Tejasvi Surya on Friday took a 'rasmalai' jibe at Raj Thackeray - who had used the term to mock BJP leader Annamalai during his election campaign - as the saffron party dominated the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and other Maharashtra civic elections.PC Mohan, Lok Sabha MP from Bangalore Central, shared photos of 'rasmalai' (Indian sweet dish) on X and wrote: ""Ordered some rasmalai. #BMCResults.""The tweet was a direct jibe at Raj Thakeray, who started a war of words with BJP MP K Annamalai earlier last week.Mumbai BJP chief spokesperson Niranjan Shetty also celebrated the party's victory by distributing rasmalai. Soon, BJP MP Tejasvi Surya also joined in on X saying, ""A sweet 'Rasmalai' victory for BJP Mumbai in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation Election. Congratulations to CM Devendra Fadnavis and all dedicated karyakartas for their tireless efforts in this victory. The Triple Engine Sarkar, under the leadership of PM Modi, will work strongly for Mumbai’s redevelopment and improve Ease of living for all Mumbaikars. ""Meanwhile, Annamalai himself congratulated the Mahayuti government for clean sweep in Maharashtra civic polls.""The people of Mumbai have spoken with crystal clarity! The historic victory of the Mahayuti alliance in the BMC elections is a resounding endorsement of development-first governance.From the grassroots of local bodies to the halls of the parliament, this is the Triple Engine that delivers real, tangible development for every citizen. While the opposition trafficked in divisive narratives aimed at fragmenting the people, Mumbai chose unity, progress, and inclusive growth,"" the BJP leader wrote on X.Taking veiled jibe at Raj Thackeray, Annamalai wrote: ""The opposition was banking on the failed strategy of dividing Mumbaikars along linguistic and regional lines, a 20th-century relic the people soundly rejected. While our NDA government talks about development infrastructure, jobs, and growth, the opposition clung to an archaic narrative of regional animosity. Mumbaikars chose substance over divisiveness. ""The 'rasmalai' controversy started when while campaigning in Mumbai for the BMC elections, Annamalai had said the city didn't belong to Maharashtra alone as it was an international city.The remarks triggered a sharp exchange at a joint Shiv Sena (UBT)–MNS rally in Mumbai. MNS chief Raj Thackeray took a swipe at Annamalai, mocking him as 'rasmalai' and questioning his authority to comment on Mumbai. He also raised the slogan “hatao lungi, bajao pungi”, a phrase long used derogatorily against South Indians in the city.Annamalai responded defiantly, saying some had threatened to cut his legs if he visited Mumbai. “I will come to Mumbai. Try cutting my legs,” he said, insisting his comments had been misrepresented.Clarifying his position, Annamalai said praising leaders like K Kamaraj did not diminish their Tamil identity, just as calling Mumbai a world-class city did not erase the role of Maharashtrians in building it. He stressed that Mumbai’s growth was inseparable from the contributions of the Marathi people.Annamalai also accused Shiv Sena leaders of insulting Tamils by mocking their traditional attire, such as lungis and veshtis, and said it was surprising that the DMK chose to share political space with parties that resorted to such remarks.Interestingly, before 'rasmalai' it was 'jalebi' that was served as a sweet revenge by the BJP.In 2024, as the BJP swept Haryana assembly elections, its Haryana unit marked its dramatic comeback and a historic third consecutive assembly win with a pointed gesture: sending a kilogram of jalebis to Congress MP Rahul Gandhi's Delhi office.","PC Mohan, Lok Sabha MP from Bangalore Central, shared photos of 'rasmalai' (Indian sweet dish) on X and wrote: ""Ordered some rasmalai. #BMCResults"" The tweet was a direct jibe at Raj Thakeray, who started a war of words with BJP MP K Annamalai earlier last week.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126569536,imgsize-1180209,width-400,resizemode-4/file-photo.jpg"

Tax neutrality for fast- track demergers

Deloitte Partner Says Budget Must Fix GST Gaps, Cut Costs, Boost Domestic Manufacturing

Clarifying the definition of Associated Enterprises (AEs)

Taxation of buyback proceeds

Boosting employment-linked deductions

TDS rationalisation

Other critical expectations

(Shaily Gupta is a Partner and Aanchal Jain is a Senior Associate at Khaitan & Co. Views expressed are personal.)

As the Union Budget 2026 approaches, expectations are running high across corporate India. This year’s budget assumes added significance as it precedes the implementation of the new Income-tax Act, 2025 (ITA 2025), effective 1 April 2026. While the ITA 2025 has primarily focused on textual and structural simplification, it has largely preserved the substantive tax framework of the erstwhile Income-tax Act, 1961 (ITA 1961). As a result, certain ambiguities, interpretational challenges and policy gaps remain unaddressed. Corporates therefore look to the upcoming Budget for targeted direct tax reforms that can enhance certainty, reduce litigation and support ease of doing business.One of the most pressing issues relates to the tax treatment of fast-track demergers under Section 233 of the Companies Act, 2013. Under the previous law, ambiguity existed on whether tax neutrality for demergers was limited to schemes sanctioned by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) under Sections 230–232, thereby excluding fast-track demergers. These schemes were introduced to simplify and expedite restructuring for small companies and wholly owned subsidiaries by eliminating judicial intervention.Fast-track demergers are similar to NCLT-approved schemes, the only distinction is the approval mechanism. Denying tax neutrality merely because of procedural differences creates an artificial distinction, defeating the objective of the fast-track route. Although the Select Committee on ITA 2025 acknowledged industry representations, the government clarified that fast-track demergers were not intended to be tax neutral as they are not court-monitored, and therefore the valuations can result in tax implications or avoidance. However, these concerns can be effectively addressed through existing anti-avoidance measures, rather than a blanket denial.With the scope of fast-track demergers expanded in September 2025, it is imperative that the definition of “demerger” under Section 2(35) of the ITA 2025 be amended to include fast-track schemes.Transfer pricing compliance hinges on the definition of Associated Enterprises (AEs). Under ITA 2025, the definition has two limbs, participation in “management,” “control,” or “capital” and specified transactional relationships such as loan arrangements, guarantees, provision of intangibles, or exclusive supply of raw materials.Ambiguity exists on whether the second limb can independently establish an AE relationship, without satisfying the foundational participation test. The current wording suggests a potentially expansive interpretation, risking overreach. It should be expressly clarified that transactional relationships alone, without participation in capital, control, or management, do not constitute an AE relationship.Finance Act (No. 2) 2024 altered the taxation of share buybacks by shifting the tax burden from companies to shareholders. Entire buyback proceeds are now taxed as dividend income, irrespective of accumulated profits and without allowing deductions, while the cost of acquisition is treated as a capital loss (eligible for set-off). This departs from the deemed dividend framework, where taxation is limited to accumulated profits.A more balanced approach would be to tax buyback proceeds as dividends only to the extent of accumulated profits, with the balance treated as sale consideration and taxed as capital gains.Additionally, shareholders should be permitted to deduct expenses incurred in relation to buyback proceeds, consistent with the treatment of other dividend income.Section 146 of ITA 2025 [corresponding section 80JJAA of ITA 1961] allow a deduction of 30% of additional employee costs for three years, but only for new employees earning up to INR 25,000 per month, a limit unchanged since 2016. Given wage inflation, this limit requires upward revision to ensure relevance and effectiveness in promoting employment.Timelines for income tax returns in business reorganisationsCurrent provisions permit filing of modified returns following a business reorganisation only where the original return has already been filed before the reorganisation order. Where the order is passed close to the due date of filing return, taxpayers face compliance challenges. A uniform six months window from the order date in all cases would bring much-needed certainty.The ever-expanding scope and complexity of TDS provisions impose significant compliance burdens. Multiple rates, frequent classification disputes and reconciliation challenges across Form 26AS/AIS, income tax returns, GST filings and financial statements, often lead to mismatches and potential denial of credit. A clear roadmap to rationalise TDS rates and simplify compliance processes is essential to reduce litigation and improve ease of doing business.Clarity is also sought for foreign component manufacturers who store goods in India for just-in-time supply, without transferring ownership. A safe harbour proposed in Budget 2025, remains unnotified and should be operationalised. Similarly, loan waivers pursuant to insolvency resolution under the IBC should be excluded from taxable income and TDS applicability, to preserve a clean slate to revived businesses.As Budget 2026 approaches, these targeted reforms can significantly reinforce India’s commitment for a stable and business-friendly tax regime.","The Union Budget 2026 approaches, expectations are running high across corporate India. This year’s budget assumes added significance as it precedes the implementation of the new Income-tax Act, 2025 (ITA 2025), effective 1 April 2026.

‘Daily Struggle To Survive’: Lawyer Exposes Grim Reality For Air India Crash Families





: The families of nine British victims of the AI 171 June 12, 2025 plane crash are suing Air India in the London high court.The families have filed a joint legal claim for personal injury and damages in the King’s Bench Division through their law firm.James Healy-Pratt, aviation partner at Keystone Law, said: “High court proceedings have been issued against Air India but have not yet been formally served on them. This is against the backdrop of upcoming confidential negotiations in London. Hopefully the parties will resolve their claims through such dialogue without the need for a trial.”When contacted by TOI, Air India declined to comment.The Boeing 787 crashed in Ahmedabad shortly after take-off; 241 of the 242 people on board perished.Mariam Javed Ali Syed (35) a brand ambassador at Harrods, and her husband Javed Ali Syed (37), manager at the Best Western Kensington Olympia Hotel, and their children, Zayn (6) and Amani (4), died in the crash.

Merge Labs vs Neuralink





ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has announced an investment in Merge Labs, a brain-computer interface (BCI) startup which was founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Rival to Elon Musk ’s Neuralink, the mission of Merge Labs is to develop safe and scaleable brain-computer interfaces. “We are excited to support and collaborate with Merge Labs as they turn an ambitious idea into reality and ultimately products that are useful for people,” said the company.OpenAI revealed that funding made by the company will support Merge Labs’ mission of creating safe, scalable brain-computer interfaces that could one day allow humans to interact with artificial intelligence directly through neural signals. The company has not yet disclosed the size of the investment, but the partnership underscores OpenAI’s growing interest in technologies that extend beyond software into hardware and human augmentation.Merge Labs is a research lab with the long-term mission of bridging biological and artificial intelligence to maximize human ability, agency, and experience. It is developing fundamentally new approaches⁠ (opens in a new window) to BCIs that are safe and interface with the brain at much higher bandwidth by combining biology, devices, and AI.The company is focused on creating non-invasive neural interfaces that can translate brain activity into digital commands. Unlike more invasive approaches that require surgical implants, Merge Labs aims to build consumer-ready devices that are both accessible and ethically designed.The company’s early prototypes reportedly use advanced sensors and machine learning models to interpret neural signals, with potential applications ranging from medical rehabilitation to enhanced productivity tools.Elon Musk founded Neuralink in 2016 and till now the company has made significant progress in developing brain implants which enable people with paralysis to control devices with the help of their thoughts. The Elon Musk-owned company recently raised $600 million at a $9 billion valuation and is conducting human trials.Merge Labs on the other hand, is reportedly working on less invasive brain interfaces with a strong emphasis on AI-powered enhancements. The focus of the startup is not just medical rehabilitation but broader human-AI integration.“I believe the merge has already started,” Altman wrote in a 2017 blog post. “We will be the first species ever to design our own descendants”.","Merge Labs is a brain-computer interface (BCI) startup founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.

YouTuber MrBeast says “I have negative money”; cannot buy a McDonald’s meal despite $5 billion company valuation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/youtuber-mrbeast-says-i-have-negative-money-cannot-buy-a-mcdonalds-meal-despite-5-billion-company-valuation/articleshow/126557701.cms,"YouTuber MrBeast

MrBeast’s 'Beast Industries' hits $5 billion valuation, but personal liquidity tells a different story



MrBeast’s Forbes net worth vs. personal cash



MrBeast: “I actually have negative money”



Focus on reinvesting, not personal savings



High-cost decisions driven by time constraints



MrBeast borrowed money for his wedding



Multiple ventures under the MrBeast brand







Jimmy Donaldson, widely known as MrBeast, is one of the most well-known people on YouTube. He runs a business and content empire that reaches hundreds of millions of people around the world, and he's only 27. His videos often have big challenges, giving back, and record-breaking prize money. People often think that MrBeast is personally wealthy in the traditional sense, with lots of money on hand, because of how he looks to the public. But a recent interview has brought a different side of his financial situation to light. Donaldson was honest about money and said that even though the company he started is worth billions, his own bank account tells a very different story. He said he has ""negative money"" and is currently borrowing money, even for big life events. His comments have brought attention to the differences between startup valuations, equity ownership, and personal liquidity, especially for founders who keep putting money into growth. The conversation gives us a better idea of how digital businesses work today and how money is often tied up on paper instead of cash.Beast Industries, MrBeast's main business, is at the heart of what he does.As per a report from Fortune in September 2025, the company is now worth $5 billion. Donaldson owns a little more than half of the company, which gives him a big stake in it. Beast Industries runs a number of businesses, such as making big YouTube videos, creating branded content, and making consumer goods. The value takes into account the company's reach, potential for revenue, and high levels of audience engagement across platforms.But the value of a company is not the same as the cash it has on hand. A valuation is what investors think the business is worth based on how much money it will make and how fast it will grow in the future. It is not the amount of money the founder has to spend every day.Forbes said that MrBeast's net worth was $85 million in June 2025. This number includes the worth of his stake in Beast Industries and other things he owns. Donaldson has made it clear that most of this net worth is in stocks and not cash.He talked about common ideas about his wealth in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. He said that a lot of people think he is a billionaire, but that is because they mix up his net worth with his available cash. He said that it is not easy to use equity in a company for everyday expenses unless it is sold or converted, which he has decided not to do.Donaldson said something very interesting about his finances during the interview. He said, ""I really... I have negative money right now."" I am borrowing money. He also said that if you take away the equity value of his company, many viewers would technically have more money in their bank accounts than he does.He gave a simple example to explain the situation, saying that company equity can't be used to buy a McDonald’s meal in the morning. This comment made it clear that there is a difference between wealth on paper and money you can actually spend.Donaldson said that his focus on work and growth affects how he handles his money. He said he doesn't think about his bank balance very often. Instead, he is focused on making videos and growing his businesses.He has said many times that a lot of the money he makes goes back into making more content. He says that spending on making content alone is expected to reach about $250 million in one year. This model of reinvesting in productions allows for more complicated works, bigger prizes, and higher production standards, which are now a defining feature of his brand.Donaldson has made some expensive spending choices when he needed to, even though he keeps a small personal account. He told one story about how he rented a private jet to see his fiancée, Thea Booysen, who was studying in the UK at the time.He said that because of where he lived and when he worked, commercial travel took a lot of time. It took a long drive and a lot of layovers to get to a big airport. Donaldson says that a private jet cut down on travel time a lot, which meant he could keep working without losing almost a whole day to travel. The flight is said to have cost about $150,000.Donaldson told people on social media in June 2025 that he had borrowed money from his mother to help pay for his wedding. He said that this happened because he put most of his money back into his businesses.He also pointed out how ironic it was that he owned companies worth billions of dollars but still needed short-term personal loans. He said again that even though the businesses look very valuable on paper, that value doesn't always turn into cash that you can use for yourself.Donaldson's business portfolio includes several big projects, not just YouTube videos. One of them is ""Beast Games,"" a competition series that gave its first-season winner $10 million, which is one of the biggest single prizes in entertainment history. Feastables is another important business. It's a consumer brand that focuses on chocolate and snack foods, and it has grown quickly in retail markets.All of these projects need a lot of money up front. Donaldson's strategy of reinvesting rather than taking personal income is supported by high operating costs, which come from prize money, production costs, staffing, and logistics.","Jimmy Donaldson, widely known as MrBeast, is one of the most well-known people on YouTube.

Record spending planned as global health indicators worsen

Bill Gates No Longer among Top 10 Billionaires: The Real Reason





Bill Gates has started putting in place the first major steps toward closing the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, one of the world’s most-influential philanthropic organisations. The foundation recently announced that it will spend a record $9 billion in 2026, its highest annual budget so far, while also preparing to cut up to 500 staff positions over the next five years. According to a Fortune report, these moves follow Gates’ decision last year to formally wind down the foundation by 2045, after spending roughly $200 billion over two decades.The latest plan marks a significant shift for the foundation at a time when many of its long-term focus areas — including global health, poverty, and US education — are under pressure due to cuts in international aid.Gates Foundation was established in 2000 as a nonprofit fighting poverty, disease, and inequity around the world. Bill Gates and his former -wife are among the top donators to the foundation. Together, they contributed $60.2 billion to the endowment through 2024. Warren Buffett, who is a former trustee and a clsowe friend of Gates donated $43.3 billion from 2006 to 2024.The foundation’s board has approved a cap on operating costs, limiting them to $1.25 billion a year, or about 14% of its budget.To meet that limit, the organisation will reduce its workforce from the current 2,375 roles, including by leaving some positions unfilled.Foundation CEO Mark Suzman said the reductions will be gradual:“We will do this thoughtfully, carefully, and systematically … We’ll be recalibrating it every year. That 500-person target is a maximum target. I very much hope that we won’t have to do it as large as that number.”Suzman said operating costs were projected to reach 18% by 2030 if no action was taken.The $9 billion budget for 2026 includes increases for programmes focused on women’s health, vaccines, polio, AI tools, and education. Gates recently wrote that global health indicators slipped last year, noting that child deaths increased for the first time in two decades.“The next five years will be difficult as we try to get back on track and work to scale up new lifesaving tools,” Gates wrote. Still, he said he remains optimistic about long-term progress.The foundation plans to accelerate spending in three key areas:• maternal and child health• infectious disease prevention• poverty reductionNotably, Bill Gates has repeatedly warned about risks from artificial intelligence (AI) but is also investing in its development. The foundation joined a coalition pledging $1 billion toward AI tools for public-sector workers in the U.S.AI remains one of the programmes that will continue to grow, Suzman confirmed.The foundation is also expanding operations in Africa and India, creating a new division focused on the two regions. Work on HIV and tuberculosis will increasingly shift from Seattle to Africa.Despite its planned closure, Suzman said the foundation still has two decades to operate and aims to make its most significant impact during that time.“We are moving into what I believe is going to be the most impactful period of the Gates Foundation,” he said.","Gates Foundation was established in 2000 as a nonprofit fighting poverty, disease, and inequity around the world.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

Reza Pahlavi Highlights India As Key Partner For A Democratic Iran In Energy Technology And Trade





Reza Pahlavi, Iran’s exiled crown prince , on Friday spoke about India–Iran ties and future cooperation, while speaking about the ongoing protests against Iran’s clerical leadership.Speaking at a news conference, Pahlavi said India and Iran shared a relationship that went back decades. Recalling earlier ties, he said former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had visited Iran when he was very young.“I remember those days,” he said, adding that the connection between the two countries has long been cultural and historical.Pahalvi said the relationship has remained strong even in modern times. “In modern history, we have had a very, very good relationship,” he said.The exiled crown prince further said that a democratic Iran would naturally seek close ties with countries that respect sovereignty and liberty. “A democratic Iran is committed to having the best possible relationship with countries that share the same values,” he said.Pahlavi said India’s history and heritage made it a natural partner for deeper cooperation. “There is a rich history that I observe in India,” he said, adding that this could form the basis of a strong bond between the two nations.Pahalvi further described India as a leader in technology and expertise, particularly in renewable energy and information technology. “India is one of the leading countries when it comes to tech and expertise,” he said, expressing hope that experts from both sides could work closely in the future.He said a new phase of ties could begin once Iran was free. “Hopefully, once we are freed, we can start a new chapter,” he said.Reza Pahlavi is the eldest son of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Iran’s last shah, who was overthrown during the 1979 Islamic Revolution. He has lived in exile since the fall of the monarchy. He has been a prominent voice calling for protests to continue in the country.Iran has been witnessing widespread anti-government protests for over two weeks. What began as demonstrations over economic distress has expanded into broader calls for political change and an end to the country’s theocratic system. Protests have spread across several cities despite heavy security deployment, internet restrictions and mass arrests.","Reza Pahlavi, Iran’s exiled crown prince, spoke about India–Iran ties and future cooperation, while speaking about the ongoing protests.

FDA quietly removes older guidance

Can cellphone radiations cause cancer?





For years, fears about cellphone radiation have lived mostly on the fringes of the internet. This week, they moved straight into the federal government. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has publicly raised alarms about 5G towers and cellphone radiation, saying he believes electromagnetic radiation poses serious health risks, including cancer and DNA damage.His comments came just as his department launched a new study into cellphone radiation, reigniting a debate scientists say has already been studied extensively.In an exclusive interview with USA TODAY, Kennedy said concerns over 5G and cellphone radiation are not hypothetical to him.“Generally speaking, electromagnetic radiation is a major health concern,” Kennedy said when asked specifically about 5G towers. “I’m very concerned about it.”Speaking for USA TODAY’s “Extremely Normal” series, Kennedy went further, claiming there is extensive scientific backing for his position.He said there are “more than 10,000 studies” documenting harmful effects from electromagnetic radiation, including cancer, tumor growth and DNA damage.“EMFs are bad depending on the pulse rates and the wave lengths,” Kennedy said. “Some of them are very bad.”Earlier the Department of Health and Human Services has highlighted cellphone restrictions in schools as part of the administration’s “Make America Healthy Again” movement. According to the department, 22 states have limited cellphone use in schools to protect children’s health.But those policies are largely aimed at reducing the mental health impacts of social media, curbing cyberbullying, and limiting constant online engagement, not exposure to electromagnetic radiation. Since 2022, K–12 schools across the US have increasingly moved to ban phones in classrooms for behavioral and psychological reasons, not radiation concerns.The interview comes at a time when the federal agencies are also signaling a shift in tone. The Food and Drug Administration, which operates under Kennedy’s leadership, has removed older webpages that stated cellphones are not dangerous.Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for HHS, explained the move in a statement: “The FDA removed webpages with old conclusions about cell phone radiation while HHS undertakes a study on electromagnetic radiation and health research to identify gaps in knowledge, including on new technologies, to ensure safety and efficacy,” Nixon said.According to The Wall Street Journal, HHS now plans to research the possible health effects of radiation emitted by cell phones. The administration has not released new scientific evidence prompting the change.That raises a key question: what does existing science actually say?arge-scale international research has repeatedly found no clear link between cellphone use and cancer.In September 2024, the World Health Organization published a comprehensive review in the journal Environmental International. Experts from nine countries analyzed 63 studies on cellphone use and cancer conducted between 1994 and 2022.“The researchers found no connection between cellphone use and brain cancer,” the WHO said.That conclusion aligns with earlier global assessments. In 2011, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), which is part of the WHO, classified radiofrequency waves as “possibly carcinogenic to humans.” However, the agency did not identify a causal link, placing cellphone radiation in the same broad category as items like pickled vegetables and coffee at the time.Some laboratory studies in rats have suggested a possible association between radiofrequency radiation and cancer. But scientists have consistently cautioned that those findings do not easily translate to humans. Human studies remain limited, inconsistent, and difficult to replicate at meaningful exposure levels.","HHS Secretary Robert F.

Shaksgam Valley: India bristles over China's fresh claim,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/shaksgam-valley-india-bristles-over-chinas-fresh-claim-dispute-explained/articleshow/126529230.cms,"Why China Building Roads In Shaksgam Valley Is A Direct Strategic Challenge For India In Kashmir

What is the Shaksgam Valley?

What is the dispute about?

Why does Shaksgam Valley matter strategically?

Proximity to Siachen and Ladakh



The valley lies close to the Siachen Glacier, where Indian and Pakistani troops have been locked in a military standoff for decades. Chinese activity in the area adds a third actor to an already volatile theatre. China-Pakistan strategic depth



The region provides China and Pakistan with contiguous territorial access, enabling coordination between Xinjiang and Gilgit-Baltistan. This was impossible before the 1963 agreement. Military and logistics implications



Infrastructure in the Shaksgam Valley improves China’s ability to move troops, equipment and supplies near India’s northern frontiers, particularly Ladakh. Precedent for territorial claims



For India, accepting Chinese control over Shaksgam would weaken its legal position on PoK as a whole and dilute the 1994 parliamentary resolution asserting that the entire region belongs to India.

What has MEA said?

What China said?

What is the China-Pakistan boundary agreement of 1963?

Why does India call the 1963 agreement illegal?

Pakistan is an occupying power: New Delhi holds that Pakistan’s control over parts of Jammu and Kashmir is illegal, making any territorial transfer invalid.

Violation of India’s sovereignty: Any alteration of borders in Jammu and Kashmir without India’s consent infringes upon its territorial integrity.

Dangerous precedent: Accepting the agreement would legitimise third-party involvement in the Kashmir dispute. This legal position has remained unchanged across governments and decades.

What is CPEC and how does it link to Shaksgam Valley?

Why is China pushing infrastructure in this area now?

Securing Xinjiang’s western approache

Protecting CPEC assets amid militant threats in Pakistan

Signalling resolve after standoffs in eastern Ladakh

Reinforce claims through physical presence

Infrastructure, in this sense, becomes both a logistical asset and a political statement.

Where does Pakistan stand?

What happens next?





NEW DELHI: China’s fresh assertion that the Shaksgam Valley “belongs to China” has reopened a largely forgotten but strategically explosive fault line in the long-running Kashmir dispute. Beijing’s defence of infrastructure construction in the region -- tied closely to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) -- has drawn a sharp response from New Delhi, which has once again described the area as an “integral and inalienable part of India”.The disagreement is not merely semantic. At stake are territorial sovereignty, India’s claims over Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), China’s growing footprint in the western Himalayas, and the future shape of regional connectivity linking Xinjiang, Gilgit-Baltistan and the Arabian Sea.This explainer breaks down what the Shaksgam Valley is, why it matters, the legal roots of the dispute, what India and China have said, and how CPEC and the 1963 China-Pakistan boundary agreement fit into the larger geopolitical picture.The Shaksgam Valley -- also known as the Trans-Karakoram Tract -- is a sparsely populated, high-altitude region located north of the Siachen Glacier . It borders China’s Xinjiang province to the north, Pakistan-occupied Gilgit-Baltistan to the south and west, and the Siachen area to the east.Geographically inhospitable, the region is marked by glaciers, mountain passes and extreme weather. Politically, however, it is one of the most sensitive pieces of territory in the Kashmir puzzle.India maintains that the Shaksgam Valley is part of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir and therefore legally belongs to India. Pakistan , which has occupied parts of Jammu and Kashmir since 1947, transferred control of the area to China in 1963 — a move New Delhi has never recognised.China currently administers the territory as part of Xinjiang and treats it as sovereign Chinese land.At its core, the dispute revolves around who has the legal authority to decide the fate of the Shaksgam Valley.India’s position is straightforward: Pakistan had no legal right to cede any part of Jammu and Kashmir to a third country because it is an occupying power in PoK. Any agreement signed by Pakistan concerning that territory is therefore “illegal and invalid”.China and Pakistan argue otherwise. They say the 1963 China-Pakistan boundary agreement was a sovereign decision between two independent states to demarcate their frontier and bring stability to a previously undefined border.Beijing has now gone a step further by asserting that infrastructure development in the region is “fully justified”, signalling that it considers the issue closed — at least from its perspective.Despite its harsh terrain, the Shaksgam Valley holds outsized strategic importance for four key reasons:India’s response has been unusually firm and consistent. Ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal has categorically rejected both China’s claims and Pakistan’s role in facilitating them.“Shaksgam Valley is an Indian territory. We have never recognised the so-called China-Pakistan boundary agreement of 1963,” Jaiswal said during a weekly briefing.He added that India also does not recognise the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which passes through territory “under forcible and illegal occupation of Pakistan”.Jaiswal underlined that the entire Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are an integral and inalienable part of India, and said New Delhi has consistently protested attempts to alter the ground reality in the Shaksgam Valley.Importantly, India has also reserved the right to take necessary measures to safeguard its interests, language that signals both diplomatic and strategic options remain open.China’s response has been equally direct.Beijing's foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning rejected India’s objections, stating: “The territory you mentioned belongs to China. It’s fully justified for China to conduct infrastructure construction on its own territory.”She said China and Pakistan had signed a boundary agreement in the 1960s and demarcated their border as an exercise of sovereign rights.On India’s criticism of CPEC, Mao repeated Beijing’s long-standing line that the project is an economic cooperation initiative aimed at development and improving livelihoods.Crucially, she added that the boundary agreement and CPEC do not affect China’s position on the Kashmir issue, which Beijing says should be resolved peacefully in accordance with UN resolutions and bilateral agreements.Signed on March 2, 1963, the China-Pakistan boundary agreement formally transferred 5,180 square kilometres of territory in the Shaksgam Valley from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir to China.At the time, Pakistan described the move as a provisional arrangement, pending the final settlement of the Kashmir dispute. The agreement includes a clause stating that once Kashmir is resolved, the sovereign authority would renegotiate the boundary with China.India rejected the agreement outright, arguing that Pakistan had no locus standi to sign away territory that legally belonged to India.For China and Pakistan, however, the agreement served a vital purpose: it created a shared land border, laying the foundation for their enduring strategic partnership.India’s objections rest on three pillars:The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is a Beijing's flagship Belt and Road Initiative project valued at around $60 billion. It links China’s Xinjiang region to Pakistan’s Gwadar port through roads, railways, energy projects and industrial zones.Parts of CPEC pass through Gilgit-Baltistan, which is a part of PoK.While Shaksgam Valley is not the most visible segment of CPEC, its integration into Chinese logistics networks strengthens Beijing’s western connectivity and supports Pakistan’s role as China’s gateway to the Arabian Sea.India argues that CPEC directly infringes on its sovereignty, and has repeatedly warned against third-country participation in projects passing through PoK.Several factors appear to be driving Beijing’s assertiveness:Pakistan has backed China’s position, insisting that the 1963 agreement is valid and that CPEC is critical to its economic future.Islamabad recently announced the creation of a Special Protection Unit to safeguard Chinese nationals working on CPEC projects, underscoring how central the corridor has become to Pakistan-China ties.India, however, continues to describe Pakistan’s actions as illegal and accuses Islamabad of trading away territory that does not belong to it.In the short term, the dispute is likely to play out diplomatically, with India continuing to lodge protests and China proceeding with its projects.In the longer term, the Shaksgam Valley could emerge as another pressure point in the already strained India-China relationship, especially if infrastructure development alters the strategic balance near Ladakh and Siachen.For New Delhi, the challenge lies in defending its territorial claims without triggering escalation, while preventing the gradual normalisation of a situation it considers unlawful.The Shaksgam Valley may be remote and uninhabited, but it sits at the crossroads of India-China rivalry, Pakistan’s territorial gambits, and China’s westward expansion.China’s renewed claim and India’s firm rejection show that the issue is far from settled. What was once a quiet footnote to the Kashmir dispute is now re-emerging as a live geopolitical fault line — one that could shape the strategic landscape of the Himalayas for years to come.","The Shaksgam Valley is a sparsely populated, high-altitude region. It borders China’s Xinjiang province to the north, Pakistan-occupied Gilgit-Baltistan to the south and west, and the Siachen area to the east. It is one of the most sensitive pieces of territory in the Kashmir puzzle. At stake are territorial sovereignty, India's claims over Pakistan- occupied Kashmir, and China's growing footprint in the Himalayas.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126529183,imgsize-1792158,width-400,resizemode-4/representative-ai-image.jpg"

‘Not 1, Not 1,000’: Jem Chief Masood Azhar Returns With Audio Threat As India Tightens Terror Noose

Def experts: Azhar’s statement sign of post-Sindoor frustration





A new audio recording purportedly featuring Maulana Masood Azhar , the elusive chief of terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), has surfaced on social media, boasting that his organisation now commands ""thousands"" of suicide bombers who are prepared for immediate deployment.The clip has surfaced at a time when Pahalgam attack mastermind and Lashkar-e-Taiba deputy chief Saifullah Kasuri was captured on video claiming that the Pakistani army had invited him to lead the funeral prayers of its soldiers after Operation Sindoor - conducted by India in May last year following the terror attack in J&K. Both clips were posted on Telegram and X by pro-ISI accounts.The messages are being viewed as a desperate propaganda attempt to revitalize a group reeling from devastating losses inflicted by the Indian armed forces during the operation. Kasoori's speech was made from a school with hundreds of children visible in the audience while Azhar too is seemingly addressing a public gathering, sources said.In another video, Kasuri has also welcomed the growing diplomatic and military ties between Pakistan and Bangladesh. The latest recording features a defiant Azhar claiming that the sheer number of his followers would ""cause an uproar in the global media"" if fully revealed.Azhar said new recruits are driven by the obsession of attaining ""martyrdom"".Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) Masood Azhar asserts that these recruits are driven by a fanatical obsession with “martyrdom”, explicitly stating that they do not seek material comforts like cars, motorcycles or foreign visas. “They only ask Allah for one thing: martyrdom,” the UN-designated terrorist claimed, attempting to project a picture of high morale and spiritual conviction among his cadre.However, defence experts suggested this was little more than a “hollow threat” and a sign of severe frustration arising out of Operation Sindoor, a series of precision strikes by India in May 2025 that decimated JeM’s infrastructure and eliminated at least 10 of Azhar’s close relatives and top aides in Bahawalpur.“This audio appears to be a calculated effort to save face after the group’s leadership was ‘torn to pieces’, as recently admitted by other JeM commanders,” said a source. Interestingly, Azhar has not been seen in public since a 2019 blast at his Bahawalpur hideout, leading to persistent rumours about his health and location.This latest audio, while lacking visual proof of his life, indicates that the terror mastermind is still attempting to operate from the shadows, deep within a safe haven in Pakistan. Security agencies are now closely analysing voice samples and metadata of the clip to track its origin and assess the current threat level posed by the group’s surviving sleeper cells, sources said.","New audio recording purportedly featuring Maulana Masood Azhar has surfaced on social media.

This latest audio, while lacking visual proof of his life, indicates that the terror mastermind is still attempting to operate from the shadows, deep within a safe haven in Pakistan.Security agencies are now closely analysing the voice samples and metadata of the clip to track its origin and assess the current threat level posed by the group’s surviving sleeper cells, sources said.","A new audio recording, purportedly featuring Maulana Masood Azhar, has surfaced on social media. He boasts that his organisation now commands ""thousands"" of suicide bombers. The messages are being viewed as a desperate propaganda attempt to revitalise a group reeling from devastating losses inflicted by Indian security forces.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126465583,imgsize-659398,width-400,resizemode-4/masood-azhar.jpg"

Congress MP says India remains ""heavily invested emotionally and politically"" in Bangladesh





DHAKA: Bangladesh's interim government of Muhammad Yunus on Thursday approved a draft ordinance to indemnify from prosecution the protesters who led the demonstrations that toppled then prime minister Sheikh Hasina's Awami League regime on August 5, 2024.At a press briefing, Law Adviser Asif Nazrul said ""the July revolutionists"" were indemnified for the acts they committed with an aim of ""political resistance"" during the uprising under the ""July Mass Uprising Protection and Accountability Ordinance"".""We had announced this earlier. It was our commitment to the July revolutionists,"" he said, emerging from a meeting of the advisory council chaired by Yunus.Nazrul said the ""political resistance"" in the case of the ordinance ""meant the acts committed by July revolutionists to restore democratic governance system toppling the fascist government"".He said the government would withdraw if any case was filed by now and no new case could be lodged against the July revolutionists, often called ""July warriors"".The adviser, however, added the law would not spare anyone who murdered others in July and August for any personal or narrow interest.The development came over a week after an inter-ministerial meeting asked the Law Ministry to quickly draft an indemnity ordinance for those involved in the student-led uprising.","Bangladesh's interim government of Muhammad Yunus approved a draft ordinance to indemnify from prosecution the protesters who toppled then prime minister Sheikh Hasina's Awami League regime.

PIOs illegally selling British work visas exposed in sting operation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/pios-illegally-selling-british-work-visas-exposed-in-sting-operation/articleshow/126512327.cms,"



LONDON: Two Indian-origin people have been caught in a sting operation in the UK selling British visas illegally for thousands of pounds and even offering them to migrants without any requirement to work.The Daily Mail said its undercover investigation found an Indian-origin female student in Britain selling work visas on Facebook Marketplace using forged documents via her company, a consultancy.In a video, taken by a Mail undercover reporter posing as an Indian film studies graduate, the woman said she can sell him a skilled worker visa for £12,000 upwards and he had two options, “with job and without job. “If you go with the job, then it will cost £17,000, £18,000, £19,000,” she said. “Without job” meant the employer “has to run the payroll only”. She explained he would get paid, after taxes were paid by the employer to the UK govt, and then he would have to pay the salary back in cash but would not have to work. She said she took a £1,000 cut.She also offered to arrange a Global Talent visa for a fee of £32,000. These visas are meant for those with exceptional talent and can lead to indefinite leave to remain after three years.She said a company would “create certificates for all your talents and create experience letters for you”.The Mail also exposed how another PIO and his business partner were offering a “free” skilled worker visa for three or five years to anyone who “invests” £25,000 in their high-street fast-food outlets. They told the Mail undercover reporter that working was not required and also advertised on Facebook Marketplace.“We don’t allow fraudulent activity on our platforms and have removed the content brought to our attention and taken action on the accounts for violating our policies,” a Meta spokesperson told TOI.When contacted by the Mail, the PIO and his partner denied any wrongdoing.A Home Office spokesperson told TOI: “The govt will do whatever it takes to secure our borders and cut the levels of migration. We are investigating this illegal activity and it will not be tolerated. We will stop at nothing to ensure our immigration rules are respected and enforced and if anyone is found flouting the rules they can expect the full force of the law to be used.”",Two Indian-origin people caught in a sting operation in the UK selling British visas illegally for thousands of pounds.

"Indian-origin Komal Shinde accused of selling UK work visas to illegal migrants for £12,000; Facebook black market exposed",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/indian-origin-komal-shinde-accused-of-selling-uk-work-visas-to-illegal-migrants-for-12000-facebook-black-market-exposed/articleshow/126484242.cms,"



An Indian-origin woman living in UK has been accused of selling illegal UK work visas to migrants for as little as £12,000, according to an undercover investigation that uncovered a growing black market operating openly on Facebook.Komal Shinde runs Krishiv Consultancy Ltd, which allegedly offered bogus skilled worker visas using fake jobs, forged documents and sham payroll records to help migrants stay in the UK illegally. She is said to be operating without any official registration or legal authority, reports the Daily Mail.The investigation found that unregulated fixers are advertising visa services on Facebook Marketplace, promising “high success approval rates” while charging migrants tens of thousands of pounds. These schemes allow migrants to enter or remain in the UK through legitimate visa routes without doing the jobs they are sponsored for.In a meeting with undercover reporters, Shinde claimed she herself is in the UK on a student visa and then went on to expose herself, saying she offered skilled worker visas for roles in restaurants, care homes and warehouses across the country. She quoted prices ranging from £12,000 to £19,000.“Without job it will cost you £12,000, £13,000 or £14,000,” she said, apparently bargaining from her end.Shinde said that job and jobless visas differ in prices: “If you go with job then it will cost £17,000, £18,000 or £19,000… Just decide whether you want to go with a job or without.”In many cases migrants were told they would not need to work at all. Instead, employers would transfer a monthly salary into their bank accounts, only for the money to be returned immediately in cash. This fake payroll cycle was designed to deceive the Home Office into believing the job was genuine due to the receipts and formalities.Shinde said she took a £1,000 cut for arranging the visas, with the rest of the money going to sponsoring employers. She warned that discretion was essential in case anything “leaked”.She also offered to arrange Global Talent visas, which are meant for people with exceptional ability in fields such as science, technology or the arts. The price for this route was up to £30,000.“You have a unique skill… they create certificates for all your talents, and they create experience letters for you — all of it is genuine,” she told the Daily Mail reporter.Shinde claimed that “7 to 8” previous applications had been successful and said applicants could also be coached for Home Office interviews. She said: “Most probably we will try that you don't have to give the interview.”The Home Office said it has launched an investigation and warned that offenders would face the “full force of the law”.Shinde has denied allegations of her selling visas or taking any cut: “I'm not fixing anything. I'm just giving the contact to the person who's selling. That's it.”Meta said it had removed content linked to the investigation and taken action against accounts violating its policies.","Komal Shinde runs Krishiv Consultancy Ltd, which allegedly offered bogus skilled worker visas using fake jobs, forged documents and sham payroll records.

"Erich von Daniken, Swiss writer who spawned alien archaeology, dies at 90",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/erich-von-daniken-swiss-writer-who-spawned-alien-archaeology-dies-at-90/articleshow/126470133.cms,".





BERLIN: Erich von Daniken, the Swiss author whose bestselling books about the extraterrestrial origins of ancient civilizations brought him fame among paranormal enthusiasts and scorn from the scientific community, has died. He was 90.Von Daniken's representatives announced on his website on Sunday that he had died the previous day in a hospital in central Switzerland.Von Daniken rose to prominence in 1968 with the publication of his first book ""Chariots of the Gods,"" in which he claimed that the Mayans and ancient Egyptians were visited by alien astronauts and instructed in advanced technology that allowed them to build giant pyramids.The book fueled a growing interest in unexplained phenomena at a time when thanks to conventional science man was about to take its first steps on the Moon.""Chariots of the Gods"" was followed by more than two dozen similar books, spawning a literary niche in which fact and fantasy were mixed together against all historical and scientific evidence.Public broadcaster SRF reported that altogether almost 70 million copies of his books were sold in more than 30 languages, making him one of the most widely read Swiss authors.While von Daniken managed to shrug off his many critics, the former hotel waiter had a troubled relationship with money throughout his life and frequently came close to financial ruin.Born in 1935, the son of a clothing manufacturer in the northern Swiss town of Schaffhausen, von Daniken is said to have rebelled against his father's strict Catholicism and the priests who instructed him at boarding school by developing his own alternatives to the biblical account of the origins of life.After leaving school in 1954, von Daniken worked as a waiter and barkeeper for several years, during which he was repeatedly accused of fraud and served a couple of short stints in prison.In 1964, he was appointed manager of a hotel in the exclusive resort town of Davos and began writing his first book. Its publication and rapid commercial success were quickly followed by accusations of tax dodging and financial impropriety, for which he again spent time behind bars.By the time he left prison, ""Chariots of the Gods"" was earning von Daniken a fortune and a second book ""Gods from Outer Space"" was ready for publication, allowing him to commit himself to his paranormal passion and travel the world in search of new mysteries to uncover.Throughout the 1970s von Daniken undertook countless field trips to Egypt, India, and above all Latin America, whose ancient cultures held a particular fascination for the amateur archaeologist.He lectured widely and set up societies devoted to promoting his theories, later pioneering the use of video and multimedia to reach out to ever-larger audiences hungry for a different account of history.No amount of criticism dissuaded him and his fans from believing that Earth has been visited repeatedly by beings from Outer Space, and will be again in the future.In 1991 von Daniken gained the damning accolade of being the first recipient of the ""Ig Nobel"" prize for literature - for raising the public awareness of science through questionable experiments or claims.Even when confronted with fabricated evidence in a British television documentary - supposedly ancient pots were shown to be almost new - von Daniken insisted that, minor discrepancies aside, his theories were essentially sound.In 1985 von Daniken wrote ""Neue Erinnerungen an die Zukunft"" - ""New Memories of the Future"" - ostensibly to address his many critics: ""I have admitted (my mistakes), but not one of the foundations of my theories has yet been brought down.""Although his popularity was waning in the English-speaking world by the 1980s, von Daniken's books and films influenced a wave of semi-serious archaeological documentaries and numerous popular television shows, including ""The X-Files,"" which featured two FBI agents tasked with solving paranormal mysteries.His last major venture, a theme park based on his books, failed after just a few years due to lack of interest. The ""Mystery Park"" still stands, its man-made pyramids and otherworldly domes rotting as tourists prefer to explore the charms of the nearby town of Interlaken and the imposing Swiss Alps that surround it.Erich von Daniken is survived by his wife of 65 years, Elisabeth Skaja, Cornelia and two grandchildren.",Erich von Daniken was a Swiss author who wrote about the extraterrestrial origins of ancient civilizations.
