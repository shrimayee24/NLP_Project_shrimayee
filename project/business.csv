The fear of machines taking away jobs is all too familiar. It first created panic when the Industrial Revolution hit. Then came the digital age. But the rapid evolution of AI poses the possibility of job losses on a scale and form not seen before.

That’s why India must revamp how it educates and upskills its youth to catch up

.

For more than two hundred years, each wave of new technology and innovation has carried with it a familiar fear that machines would take away people’s livelihoods. During the Industrial Revolution, the mechanisation of textiles and manufacturing triggered fears of “technological unemployment.” This panic even gave rise to the famous Luddite movement in England, where textile workers destroyed looms they thought would make their jobs obsolete. In reality, while machines did replace some manual weavers, industrialisation also generated vast new opportunities in factories, coal mining, engineering, and other emerging sectors.After World War II, automation and computers revived fears of a “jobless future”. Clerical roles like typists vanished, but new opportunities in software, electronics, and IT created even more jobs. The 1990s internet boom again disrupted work, with automation and outsourcing displacing factory and call-centre jobs.Yet, fresh industries emerged in e-commerce, app development, digital marketing, and cybersecurity.However, this time around the concern seems different and justifiable. The rapid evolution of AI and automation poses the possibility of job losses on a scale and form not experienced before. A McKinsey report estimates that by 2030, automation could replace up to 30% of hours worked in the US, forcing 12 million workers to shift roles. The ILO (International Labour Organization) warns the impact could be even more severe in India, with nearly 70% of existing jobs at high risk from AI and automation.Unlike earlier waves of innovation, even cognitive roles like coding, medical diagnosis, creative content, recruitment, customer support are all increasingly automatable. Now, with robotics and AI, even non-routine manual tasks such as warehouse picking, surgery assistance, and food preparation face the risk of being automated.But the situation is not really as grim as it may sound. If history is any guide, while many occupations will require people to work alongside technology, AI and robotics are likely to add net jobs. American economist David Autor has for long argued that tech and innovation have led to productivity growth, directly augmenting employment. Productivity growth in one sector generates large positive spillovers to employment growth elsewhere in the economy.For a developing economy like India, whether technology and innovation in AI, robotics, and automation lead to a net gain in jobs will largely depend on two key factors. One, how well we equip our students and the workforce through skilling and upskilling and make them job ready; and two, how strongly we invest in research and development.India’s biggest challenge today is that our skills and institutions have not kept pace with rapid shifts in technology. Each year, over 10 million students graduate from colleges and universities, yet the job market struggles to absorb them. A recent report by Mercer Mettl puts the employability of graduates in India at 42.6%. Multiple studies find that 85% of Indian engineering graduates are not job-ready. Our school education relies on rote learning with little focus on practical skills and critical thinking. Higher education is theory heavy.First, we must revamp our skilling programmes with a forward-looking lens, aligned to jobs of the future. Many semi-skilled roles will sustain and grow, be it in frontline sales, relationship managers or after-sales support in banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI), retail, and telecom, due to our cultural preference for trust and personal interaction. These can absorb large sections of young, educated workers.Similarly, delivery and logistics roles in quick commerce will expand, offering opportunities for lows-killed workers where machines cannot easily replace humans. With India’s tourism and hospitality sector set to grow, demand will rise for frontline staff, travel consultants, chefs, guides, and wildlife experts — creating strong need for skilled and semi-skilled workers.At the same time, AI and automation will reshape employment. In finance, routine processes like loan approvals will be automated, creating demand for specialists in AI training, analytics, and cyber-risk. In manufacturing, repetitive assembly jobs will decline, while technical roles in robotics supervision, maintenance, and monitoring will rise. New roles are expected to emerge in data and artificial intelligence, engineering, cloud computing and product development that will need highly skilled workers, and we need to prepare.The govt must strengthen apprenticeship programmes to meet the needs of a changing economy. So far, India’s apprenticeship model has struggled to bridge academia and industry, with training focused largely on traditional trades like fitter and welder when focus should be on courses in AI, automation, renewable energy, tourism and so on. Even short-term courses (3-6 months) in using computers, soft skills like communication, problem-solving, and interpersonal skills can cater to demand in retail, BFSI, and telecom sectors. The revamped hub-and-spoke ITI model announced in the 2024-25 budget under the National Scheme for ITI Upgradation could fill this gap by upgrading curricula and training with industry participation. Its success, however, will depend on effective execution, as past ITI reform efforts at both central and state levels have delivered limited impact.Secondly, India needs to put emphasis on research and development. The future of jobs will be shaped not just by who can use technology, but by who can create and lead it. The US, China, South Korea, and Germany succeeded in their engineering revolutions through large-scale investments in research and innovation, that formed the backbone of job creation in manufacturing, software, electronics, and semiconductors. India still lags behind — while China received 798,337 patent grants in 2023, the US 323,410, Japan 201,420, and South Korea 135,180, India managed 30,490. We are catching up, but we need to do more to shape the future of work.The govt’s launch of the Research and Development Innovation Fund (RDIF) and the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) is a right step forward. It provides both a roadmap and corpus to boost research and innovation in the private sector and academia. But much more can be done to create a strong ecosystem for corporate R&D in India.Several ministries already operate with R&D budgets — the ministry of science & technology was allocated a budget of Rs 16,628 crore in FY25 — yet these are often scattered. State govts too can create regional R&D incentives, sector-specific funds and work with local industries and universities. ANRF should quickly work on mapping, monitoring, and aligning all ministry and state-level R&D budgets with streamlined priorities. The foundation can also pool resources from multiple ministries into cross-sectoral missions such as green energy, AI in healthcare and advanced manufacturing instead of isolated projects.Technology and innovation can certainly lead to net addition of jobs in India. But the outcome largely depends on how we manage the transition .The author is chairperson, Quess Corp","The rapid evolution of AI and automation poses the possibility of job losses on a scale and form not experienced before.

61 Senior Naxal Cadres Surrender In Gadchiroli In Presence Of Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis

Andhra, Telangana latest states to be out of Naxal-affected list, says

MHA

New Delhi: Months ahead of the March 31, 2026 deadline to fully eliminate armed Naxalism from the country, the Centre declared that the total number of Left-wing extremism-hit districts have fallen to just 11 from 18 in March 2025 and 126 in 2013, with the “most-affected districts” also down to three from six in the last seven months.Hailing the “historic milestone in eliminating Naxalism” in a post on X, home minister Amit Shah said, “Under Modi ji's vision for a terror-free India, tireless counter-insurgency operations and people-centric development are shrinking the space of the left-wing extremists, leaving no place for them to hide. By March 31, 2026, India will be free from the menace of Naxalism”.The home ministry in a separate statement said only Bijapur, Sukma and Narayanpur districts in Chhattisgarh are now most-affected by left wing extremism (LWE).Kanker district in Chhattisgarh, West Singhbhum in Jharkhand, and Gadchiroli in Maharashtra have been shifted from the list of districts “most affected” by Left-wing extremism to “affected” category after latest review by the home ministry.The five remaining districts in “Naxal-affected” list are Gariyaband, Dantewada, and Mohalla-Manpur-Ambagarh Chowki in Chhattisgarh; Balaghat in MP; and Kandhamal in Odisha.Seven districts — Alluri Sitarama Raju in Andhra Pradesh, Kalahandi and Malkangiri in Odisha, Bhadradri-Kothagudem and Mulugu in Telangana, Latehar in Jharkhand, and Nuapada in Odisha — have been removed from the MHA list.Andhra and Telangana are now out of the LWE-affected states. Earlier, in March 2025, Kerala (Wayanad & Kannur) and West Bengal (Jhargram) were also delisted.Operational successes in 2025 have been record-breaking, with 312 LWE cadres killed — including the CPI (Maoist) general secretary and eight other politburo or central committee members. Another 836 cadres were arrested and 1,639 surrendered.Modi govt’s National Action Plan against LWE — focused on intelligence-based ops, targeting leadership, development of infra, choking finances, and Centre-state coordination — has delivered major setbacks to the movement once dubbed India’s “biggest internal security challenge.”","Andhra and Telangana are now out of the LWE-affected states.

Tata Motors demerger: What does it mean for investors & why did the share price drop 40%?

What does Tata Motors demerger mean for investors?

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Tata Motors demerger: Tata Motors shares dropped by 40% during early trading on Tuesday, with shares opening at Rs 399 on the Bombay Stock Exchange, compared to Monday's closing price of Rs 660.90. This is a notional decline in Tata Motors' share price post its demerger, according to an ET report.This adjustment occurred as the shares commenced trading ex-demerger value following the division of its commercial vehicles operations into a separate listed company. The reduction corresponds to the commercial vehicle division's removal from the parent company's valuation.October 14 is the record date for the company's division into Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd (TMPV) and Tata Motors Commercial Vehicles Ltd (TMLCV). Investors holding shares through October 13 will be allocated one TMLCV share for each Tata Motors share owned.The company will adopt the name Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd (TMPV), comprising passenger vehicles, electric vehicles and Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) units. TMLCV shares will be transferred to demat accounts within 30-45 days, followed by independent listing on the NSE and BSE after securing regulatory clearances.The existing F&O contracts due in October, November and December were concluded on Monday, with new contracts featuring adjusted lot sizes introduced from today.Financial experts anticipate the separation to enhance value assessment and business specialisation.SBI Securities indicates that the division ""enables clearer valuation of the company's distinct businesses."" They forecast TMPV, generating 87% of revenue from JLR, to be valued between Rs 285 and Rs 384 following the split, with growth prospects tied to JLR's operational improvements.For TMLCV, SBI Securities estimates a valuation range of Rs 320-470, highlighting its forthcoming €3.8 billion purchase of Iveco Group NV's commercial vehicle division, which should triple combined turnover and strengthen presence in electric and alternative fuel technologies. ""The integration of Iveco Group NV, most likely in FY27, will expose the company to the global CV cycle,"" they note, whilst cautioning about temporary margin reduction due to Iveco's lower EBIT performance.YES Securities views the separation as a ""value unlocking opportunity,"" observing that standalone passenger and commercial vehicle operations will enable targeted investment in specific automotive sectors.Brokerages say the demerger allows for a clearer valuation of Tata Motors’ separate businesses. “Overall, we expect value creation, as the commercial vehicles (CV) business is likely to trade at around 11 times EV/EBITDA on a FY27 basis, which translates to roughly Rs 300, in line with comparable peers,” said Pankaj Pandey of ICICI Securities, as quoted by Economic Times.“For the passenger vehicles (PV) segment, we estimate a fair value in the range of Rs 450 to 500. Since this is a vertical split, one of the most anticipated demergers, we believe there should be value creation, as the PV and CV businesses are poised for distinct growth trajectories,” Pandey added.According to Bonanza Research Analyst Khushi Mistry, the division ""will lead to sharper business focus for both entities."" TMLCV debuts as India's premier commercial vehicle manufacturer, commanding 37.1% market share and achieving 12.2% EBITDA margin in Q1FY26, despite reduced revenue. TMPV anticipates 8-10% growth in H2FY26, driven by product launches, strong SUV market position, and increasing EV and CNG adoption, representing 45% of its passenger vehicle earnings.Following a September cyberattack, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), the UK subsidiary of Tata Motors, initiated phased manufacturing operations on October 8. Khushi Mistry reported that wholesale volumes decreased by 24% while retail sales fell 17% in the September quarter, resulting in estimated weekly losses of £50 million. ""Full production is expected to resume post-Christmas due to the scale of restoration needed,"" she stated.YES Securities assessed that ""2QFY26 JLR dispatches (-24% YoY and QoQ) were impacted by production losses due to the cyberattack from early Sep'25. However, the retail-level impact was much lower. We expect volumes to gradually improve in 3Q and 4Q, which should support sentiment.""The share distribution plan allocates one TMLCV share per Tata Motors share owned. Details regarding acquisition costs for both entities will be provided subsequently to facilitate portfolio and tax calculations.Share price fluctuations are anticipated during the structural transition period. Industry analysts indicate that future performance will be determined by JLR's production recovery and TMLCV's operational success following the Iveco integration.The investment community remains focused on whether the corporate separation will boost Tata Motors' share performance or if value enhancement will require a longer timeline.","Tata Motors shares dropped by 40% during early trading on Tuesday, with shares opening at Rs 399 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.

"EPFO final settlement period extended: PF withdrawal now after 12 months, pension after 36 months; what it means for members",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/epfo-final-settlement-period-extended-pf-withdrawal-now-after-12-months-pension-after-36-months-what-it-means-for-members/articleshow/124554802.cms,"



The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has extended the period for final settlement or full withdrawal of funds from provident fund and pension accounts for unemployed members. Under the revised rules, members can now withdraw their provident fund after 12 months of unemployment and their pension after 36 months, PTI reported.The change was approved by the apex decision-making body of the EPFO, the Central Board of Trustees, chaired by Labour Minister Mansukh Mandaviya, during a meeting held on Monday. Earlier, the scheme allowed full withdrawals from both accounts after just two months of continuous unemployment.A senior official explained PTI that the move aims to ensure social security for formal sector workers who typically exit the EPFO after two months of unemployment. “Most of these unemployed youth need to enrol again when they secure new jobs and lose chances of earning pension and other benefits, as an account becomes pensionable only after a combined service of 10 years or more,” the official said.The ministry said the revision will also allow partial withdrawals, enabling members to meet immediate financial needs without affecting their retirement savings or pension entitlements.Additionally, a provision has been introduced to maintain a minimum balance of 25 per cent of contributions in members’ accounts at all times.“This will enable members to enjoy the high interest rate currently offered by the EPFO, 8.25 per cent per annum, along with compounding benefits to build a sizeable retirement corpus,” the statement added.The rationalisation is intended to improve ease of access while ensuring members maintain a sufficient retirement fund over the long term.","EPFO has extended the period for final settlement or full withdrawal of funds from provident fund and pension accounts for unemployed members.

Chandrababu Naidu’s Bold Vision: Bullet Train To Connect Hyderabad, Amaravati, Chennai And Bengaluru

NEW DELHI: The Indian Railways will next focus on building ‘dedicated passenger corridors’ to cater to the growing passenger demand while increasing the capacity of existing tracks and developing Vande Bharat 4.0 trains, railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said on Wednesday.He said the dedicated passenger corridors will be designed for a speed of 350 kmph and an operational speed of 320 kmph and will be completely indigenous, providing huge opportunities to Indian players. The minister also warned suppliers and manufacturers against compromising on the quality of products and directed the Railway Board chairman to be ‘ruthless’ in blacklisting and blocking such companies from getting any work in the sector.Addressing industry players after he inaugurated the International Railway Equipment Exhibition, the minister said there are three major focus areas for railways: provide enough service for passengers and their comfort, ensure safety and make the national transporter ready for at least the next 25 years.On the target to have dedicated passenger corridors, Vaishnaw said, “We have to start constructing dedicated passenger corridors because we are 1.4 billion people; the transportation demand is humongous, and we have successful examples of economies of similar nature...Thesecorridors will be equipped with indigenously developed signalling systems and modern Operations Control Centres (OCCs).” He added that such corridors will be constructed across the country, and the target is to develop around 7,000 km of them in the next two decades.While highlighting the success of Vande Bharat trains, he urged the industry and railway engineers to reimagine the indigenous semi-high-speed train. The current Vande Bharat (3.0) is capable of accelerating from 0 to 100 kmph in 52 seconds. “The new version will focus on enhancing toilets, improving seats and elevating the overall workmanship of the coaches. Vande Bharat 4.0 (to be launched in the next 18 months) should be a train so advanced in quality and comfort that countries around the world aspire to adopt it,” the minister said.Vaishnaw urged manufacturers to focus on quality and safety, cautioning that “those who do not improve will lose out”. He directed the Railway Board chairman to carry out strict checks and blacklist those supplying poor quality materials.On the hydrogen-powered train, Vaishnaw said a 2,400-horsepower model has been developed entirely indigenously. “We will not import this technology. We will design it ourselves,” he said.",The Indian Railways will next focus on building ‘dedicated passenger corridors’ to cater to the growing passenger demand.

Fantastic Opportunity For Both: British Chambers of Commerce Hails UK-India Trade Deal as 'Win-Win'

The Indian Army on Wednesday signed the agreement with UK-based Thales group for the procurement of the Light Weight Modular Missile (LMM) system to significantly boost its air defence architecture and strengthen its air capabilities.Thales will manufacture the missiles and launchers at Belfast, Northern Ireland, before delivering them to the Indian Army.The contract follows days after India-UK defence initiatives unveiled during British Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s visit to India.In a joint statement, the Centre said the deal will further support India’s air defence capabilities and, in the spirit of ' Atmanirbhar Bharat', meet current and future requirements of the Indian Ministry of Defence while fostering long-term collaboration on complex weapons between the two countries.British defence secretary John Healey had said, ""The defence deals announced today show how our growing strategic partnership with India will boost UK business and jobs. I am hopeful this will pave the way for a deeper relationship between our two defence industries, particularly in the development of electric engines for naval ships and in air defence"" he added.The LMM is a lightweight, man-portable missile system that can be deployed in operational areas, including high-altitude regions, the Indian Army said.The missile operates on a laser beam riding guidance system, allowing precision strikes with minimal collateral damage. Equipped with a triple-effect warhead and proximity fuse, it is effective against aircraft, helicopters, UAVs, and UCAVs, including low-infrared signature targets, at ranges beyond 6 km in all-weather conditions.Weighing just 13 kg, the LMM is a supersonic weapon with speeds above Mach 1.5. Its advanced sighting system and high-explosive warhead give it a high single-shot kill probability. The system is optimised for air, land, and naval deployments, enabling rapid response against drones, light aircraft, and helicopters near borders or frontline positions, reported news agency ANI.","The Indian Army on Wednesday signed the agreement with UK-based Thales group for the procurement of the Light Weight Modular Missile (LMM) system.

NEW DELHI: Balancing the concerns for environment, sentiments of citizens during the festive season and right to livelihood of workers in the firecracker industry, Supreme Court on Wednesday temporarily relaxed its complete ban and allowed bursting of only green crackers on two Diwali days, both in the morning and evening.Permitting the sale of NEERI-approved green firecrackers through designated outlets from Oct 19 to Oct 20, a bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran ordered district administrations and police to “ensure that use of firecrackers shall be confined between 6-7am and 8-10pm on the two days i.e. the one before and on Diwali day”.However, SC banned sale of crackers through e-commerce websites and transportation of any kind of crackers from outside into the National Capital Region (NCR). It continued the ban on joined firecrackers (laris). The court asked Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and state PCBs to monitor air quality index (AQI) daily from Oct 14 to 25, and file a report in SC.Pronouncing the 21-page order five days ahead of Diwali, CJI Gavai said the permission to burst only green crackers, as allowed by SC in its Oct 23, 2018, judgment, was turned into a ban on all forms of crackers in Delhi and NCR on Dec 19 last year based on a complete ban on crackers issued by the Delhi govt on Oct 14 last year.The bench said the SC ban on crackers has been observed more in breach during festive days as conventional firecrackers were smuggled in and burst, causing more harm to the environment. “In such a case, we must take a balanced approach, taking into account the conflicting interests and permit in moderation, while not compromising the environmental concerns arising,” it said.","Supreme Court allows bursting of only green crackers on two Diwali days, both in the morning and evening.

New Delhi: Calling it a “bogus challenge” to the will of late businessman Sunjay Kapur, his wife Priya on Wednesday told Delhi high court that incorrect spellings or addresses can’t be grounds to invalidate the document.Rebutting the allegations levelled by Kapur’s ex-wife Karisma Kapoor ’s children that the will was forged, Priya’s counsel Rajiv Nayyar told the court that no one had disputed or denied Sunjay’s signatures or those of the other two witnesses.The only ground to challenge the will, he told Justice Jyoti Singh, was if the deceased was not of sound mind, was under coercion, or was under some inability to execute the will. He told HC there was “nothing unusual in the bequest” since “in wife vs wife he would obviously name the present wife as beneficiary over an estranged wife”. The plea of the plaintiffs, Samaira and Kiaan Raj, was bereft of any cause of action, he argued.“Now I am told there are four additional grounds to invalidate a will — wrong spelling, wrong address, writing testatrix instead of testator, and closeness of witnesses,” Nayyar said.“There were two opportunities for the plaintiff. There was a will reading. It was read out to everyone, including the plaintiff... The suit was filed on Sept 9. There is no reference or challenge to the will in the plaint. The will was shared with them on Sept 15. They were conscious of the existence of the will as far back as July 30, prior to the filing of the suit. Today we are dealing with a non-existent challenge to the will” he said.",Kapur’s ex-wife Karisma Kapoor ’s children allege that the will was forged. Kapur's wife Priya tells Delhi high court incorrect spellings or addresses can’t be grounds to invalidate the document. No one had disputed or denied Sunjay's signatures or those of the other two witnesses.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124590205,imgsize-23010,width-400,resizemode-4/screenshot-2025-10-16-015146.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Chief minister Nitish Kumar ’s Janata Dal (United) on Wednesday released its first list of 57 candidates ahead of the Bihar assembly elections.JD(U), which is looking to retain power in the state, has fielded 30 new faces, while 27 sitting MLAs have been renominated.The announcement comes as National Democratic Alliance (NDA) partners continue to send mixed signals over seat allocations, just days after the seat-sharing deal was finalised. Under the arrangement, JD(U) and BJP will contest 101 seats each, Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) 29 seats, and Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM) and Rashtriya Lok Morcha (RLM) six seats each.The upcoming election appears to be a sequel to the previous assembly polls, when chief minister Nitish Kumar and Chirag Paswan clashed after the latter broke away from the NDA to contest independently. In 2020, though Chirag’s party won just one seat out of 135 contested, it inflicted heavy damage on JD(U), defeating its candidates in over two dozen constituencies and reducing Nitish’s party to 43 seats — its lowest tally ever.This time, JD(U) has fielded candidates in five constituencies reportedly eyed by Chirag’s Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas).JD(U) named Komal Singh (Gaighat), Ratnesh Sada (Sonbarsa), Vidyasagar Singh Nishad (Morwa), Rajkumar Singh (Matihani) and Kaushal Kishore (Rajgir).Notably, two of these five seats are reserved for Scheduled Castes - a key voter base for LJP (RV).As in every Bihar election, caste has been a decisive factor in candidate selection and JD(U)'s list seems to try and balance the equation. Banking on its social justice plank, the party has given tickets to 23 OBC candidates that include nine Kushwahas, 10 Kurmis, three Yadavs, and one Baniya. It has also fielded 12 Scheduled Caste candidates.In addition, nine Extremely Backward Caste (EBC) nominees - JD(U)’s largest support base - are in the fray.Among upper castes, 13 candidates have been fielded - six Bhumihars, five Rajputs, and two Brahmins.JD(U) has not fielded a single Muslim candidate in its first list, a notable omission given the party’s traditional appeal among Muslim voters within the NDA.In the 2020 assembly elections, JD(U) fielded 11 Muslim candidates out of 115 seats, none of whom won. The figure, around 10%, was already lower than the community's share of Bihar's population (over 15%).JD(U) has fielded five of the cabinet ministers from CM Nitish Kumar's cabinet. Those who have made the cut are: Shravan Kumar (Nalanda), Vijay Kumar Chaudhary (Sarairanjan), Maheshwar Hazari (Kalyanpur), Madan Sahni (Bahadurpur) and Ratnesh Sada (Sonbarsa).The party has also fielded four women candidates: Komal Singh (Gaighat), Ashwamedh Devi (Samastipur), Ravina Kushwaha (Vibhutipur) and Kavita Kumari Saha (Madhepura).Turncoats, too, have found space. Shyam Rajak, who rejoined JD(U) after quitting RJD last year, and strongman Anant Kumar Singh, who has filed his nomination from Mokama, are among those fielded.The Election Commission has announced the schedule for the Bihar Assembly elections. The 243 assembly seats will go to the polls in two phases on November 6 and November 11, with the counting of votes scheduled to take place on November 14.The total number of electors in the final list stands at 7.42 crore, while there were 7.89 crore electors as of June 24 this year. An Election Commission press release stated that 65 lakh voters were removed from the draft list, and the number of electors in the draft list as of August 1, 2025, stood at 7.24 crore.In the 2020 assembly election, the BJP contested 110 seats and won 74, securing 19.8% of the vote share. The Janata Dal (United) contested 115 seats and won 43, with a 15.7% vote share. The Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) contested seven seats, winning four, and achieved 0.9% of the vote share.","JD(U) has fielded 30 new faces, while 27 sitting MLAs have been renominated.

Carbon dioxide levels increase by record amount to new highs in 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/carbon-dioxide-levels-increase-by-record-amount-to-new-highs-in-2024/articleshow/124584004.cms,"Representative image

Carbon dioxide – continued emissions and less effective carbon sinks

Methane and Nitrous Oxide

BATHINDA: Carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the atmosphere soared by a record amount to new highs in 2024, committing the planet to more long-term temperature increase, according to a new report from the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO).The WMO Greenhouse Gas Bulletin said continued emissions of CO2 from human activities and an upsurge from wildfires were responsible, as well as reduced CO2 absorption by “sinks” such as land ecosystems and the ocean – in what threatens to be a vicious climate cycle.Growth rates of CO2 have tripled since the 1960s, accelerating from an annual average increase of 0.8 ppm per year to 2.4 ppm per year in the decade from 2011 to 2020. From 2023 to 2024, the global average concentration of CO2 surged by 3.5 ppm, the largest increase since modern measurements started in 1957.“The heat trapped by CO2 and other greenhouse gases is turbo-charging our climate and leading to more extreme weather. Reducing emissions is therefore essential not just for our climate but also for our economic security and community well-being,” said WMO Deputy Secretary-General Ko Barrett.Concentrations of methane and nitrous oxide – the second and third most important long-lived greenhouse gases related to human activities – have also risen to record levels.WMO released the annual greenhouse gas bulletin to provide authoritative scientific information for the UN Climate Change conference in November. The COP 30 meeting in Belém, Brazil, will seek to ramp up climate action.“Sustaining and expanding greenhouse gas monitoring are critical to support such efforts,” said Oksana Tarasova, coordinator of the Greenhouse Gas Bulletin, which is one of WMO’s flagship scientific reports and is now in its 21st issue.When the bulletin was first published in 2004, the annual average level of CO2 measured by WMO’s Global Atmosphere Watch network of monitoring stations was 377.1 ppm. In 2024 it was 423.9 ppm.About half of the total CO2 emitted each year remains in the atmosphere and the rest is absorbed by Earth’s land ecosystems and oceans. However, this storage is not permanent. As global temperature rises, the oceans absorb less CO2 because of decreased solubility at higher temperatures, whilst land sinks are impacted on a number of ways, including the potential for more persistent drought.The likely reason for the record growth between 2023 and 2024 was a large contribution from wildfire emissions and a reduced uptake of CO2 by land and the ocean in 2024 – the warmest year on record, with a strong El Niño.During El Niño years, CO2 levels tend to rise because the efficiency of land carbon sinks is reduced by drier vegetation and forest fires – as was the case with exceptional drought and fires in the Amazon and southern Africa in 2024.“There is concern that terrestrial and ocean CO2 sinks are becoming less effective, which will increase the amount of CO2 that stays in the atmosphere, thereby accelerating global warming . Sustained and strengthened greenhouse gas monitoring is critical to understanding these loops,” said Oksana Tarasova, a WMO senior scientific officer.Today’s CO2 emissions to the atmosphere not only impact global climate today, but will do so for hundreds of years because of its long lifetime in the atmosphere.Methane accounts for about 16% of the warming effect on our climate by long-lived greenhouse gases and has a lifetime of about nine years. Approximately 40% of methane is emitted into the atmosphere by natural sources (for example, wetlands) which are sensitive to climate as well, and about 60% comes from anthropogenic sources such as cattle, rice farming, fossil fuel exploitation, landfills and biomass burning.The globally averaged methane concentration in 2024 were 1942 parts per billion (ppb) – an increase of 166% above pre-industrial (before 1750) levels.Nitrous oxide is the third most important long-lived greenhouse gas and comes from both natural sources and due to human activities such as biomass burning, fertiliser use and various industrial processes.The globally averaged concentration reached 338.0 ppb in 2024, an increase of 25% over the pre-industrial level.","From 2023 to 2024, the global average concentration of CO2 surged by 3.5 ppm, the largest increase since modern measurements started in 1957. WMO released the annual greenhouse gas bulletin to provide authoritative scientific information for the UN Climate Change conference in November.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124584023,imgsize-455364,width-400,resizemode-4/pic-8.jpg"
"'Less harmful, not safe': Green crackers cleaner but far from risk-free, say experts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/less-harmful-not-safe-green-crackers-cleaner-but-far-from-risk-free-say-experts/articleshow/124583596.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday allowed the sale and bursting of green firecrackers in Delhi-NCR during Diwali , subject to time restrictions: 6 am to 7 am and 8 pm to 10 pm on the day before Diwali and on the festival day itself. The court had first imposed a ban on firecrackers in the region in 2014-15 due to rising pollution levels.But are the green crackers completely safe?Designed to reduce emissions by about 30%, green crackers are a cleaner alternative to traditional firecrackers, created in India to tackle air and noise pollution during festivals like Diwali.While these specially formulated fireworks are considered environmentally friendlier, experts caution that they are not entirely harmless.Green crackers were first introduced in 2018 by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research – National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (CSIR–NEERI), in collaboration with the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and other scientific bodies. The crackers were developed in response to dangerously high pollution levels in cities such as Delhi, especially during the winter months, news agency PTI reported Dipankar Saha, former additional director and head of air laboratories at CPCB Delhi as saying.Unlike conventional firecrackers, green crackers use less toxic raw materials and avoid harmful chemicals like barium nitrate and aluminium, which contribute heavily to air pollution and can trigger respiratory problems and other health issues. During ignition, these crackers release water vapour or dust suppressants, which help reduce particulate matter in the air. Laboratory tests show that these modifications cut emissions by up to 30%.In addition to lower air pollution, green crackers produce less noise, making them a safer option for children, the elderly, animals, and people with health sensitivities. Reduced decibel levels also help address noise pollution, a major concern during festival seasons.Green crackers are officially approved by the CPCB, and only variants certified by the Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO) are legally permitted for sale and use. Authentic products carry the CPCB logo on their packaging. Popular approved types include SWAS (Safe Water Releaser), STAR (Safe Thermite Cracker), and SAFAL (Safe Minimal Aluminium Cracker), designed to balance cultural celebrations with environmental responsibility.However, environmentalist Bhavreen Kandhari warned that while green crackers are a better choice, they are “less harmful, not safe.” She stressed that the release of ultrafine particles and toxic gases still occurs, and limiting the overall use of firecrackers remains the most effective way to reduce festival pollution.Meanwhile, air pollution curbs (GRAP) stage 1 were imposed a day before as air quality detoriated.",The Supreme Court on Wednesday allowed the sale and bursting of green firecrackers in Delhi-NCR during Diwali.

Congress MP Manickam Tagore and TMC MP Saket Gokhale demanded that government scrap the changes without delay.Tagore and Gokhale focused on the changes that state that Provident Fund money can be withdrawn only after 12 months of unemployment, and pension can be withdrawn only after 36 months. The period for withdrawal for both the categories was two months till now.Tagore said, “Besides the withdrawal norms, 25% of your own EPF will be locked forever. Who benefits from this, PM Modi ? Certainly not the workers. Imagine a worker who loses his job or a retiree waiting for years to access his hard-earned savings — while government writes off lakhs of crores for its crony friends. This is not reform, this is robbery.” He urged PM Narendra Modi “to not let bureaucratic cruelty destroy the dignity of India’s working class.”Gokhale said, “It is clear that the Modi govt is expecting a drastic rise in unemployment due to its terrible economic policies. These new rules locking people’s EPF are the signs of a panicked govt trying to prevent a run on the EPFO.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday observed that the government is “not ready to evolve” after the Centre said it may not be “very feasible” to give death row convicts the option to choose lethal injection as a mode of execution.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta was hearing a plea seeking removal of hanging as the sole method of executing death row convicts in India.Senior advocate Rishi Malhotra, who filed the petition in 2017, argued that condemned prisoners should at least be given a choice between hanging and lethal injection. Malhotra had originally sought the abolition of hanging, proposing less painful alternatives such as “intravenous lethal injection, shooting, electrocution, or gas chamber.”""I will demonstrate that the best way is lethal injection because 49 out of 50 states in the USA have adopted lethal injection,"" Malhotra said, as quoted by PTI. He added that execution by lethal injection was quick, humane, and decent compared to hanging, which he described as cruel and barbaric, with the body lingering on the rope for around 40 minutes.Justice Mehta suggested that the counsel representing the Centre advise the government on Malhotra's proposal.The Centre's counsel responded, ""This is also addressed in the counter that this may not be very feasible to give an option.""Justice Mehta remarked, ""The problem is that the government is not ready to evolve over the period of time... Things have changed over a period of time.""The bench has posted the matter for further hearing on November 11.The Centre’s counsel said the choice of execution method is a policy decision for the government. They referred to the Supreme Court's May 2023 order, which had noted the attorney general’s proposal to set up a committee to review issues related to execution methods. The Centre said it would seek instructions on the current status of that committee.In 2018, the Centre had strongly supported retaining hanging as the sole method of execution, stating that other methods such as lethal injection or firing were not necessarily less painful. The counter affidavit filed by the ministry of home affairs described hanging as “quick, simple” and free from anything that would “unnecessarily sharpen the poignancy of the prisoner.”The PIL also cited the 187th Report of the Law Commission, which recommended removing hanging as the mandatory method of execution in India, PTI reported.",The Supreme Court was hearing a plea seeking removal of hanging as the sole method of executing death row convicts in India.

Private forecasters said much of the intense rainfall may be over interior districts, while coastal districts could see moderate rain for at least the next five days.“The northeast monsoon rainfall is likely to commence over Tamil Nadu-Puducherry-Karaikal, KeralaMahe, south interior Karnataka, south coastal Andhra Pradesh, and Rayalaseema during the next 24 hours,” said an IMD bulletin on Wednesday.The northeast monsoon is crucial for Tamil Nadu and Chennai, bringing 48% of the state’s annual rainfall and 63% of the city’s, about 45cm and 87cm respectively.On Thursday, the city and suburbs may receive a few spells of moderate to heavy rain with thunder and lightning over some areas. The maximum temperature may be around 31°C and the minimum between 24°C and 25°C.Between Oct 17 and 20, heavy rain activity is expected to shift to western and southern districts.Mahesh Palawat, chief meteorologist, Skymet Weather, said the heavy rainfall over interior Tamil Nadu may be due to an upper air cyclonic circulation over the Comorin area. “For the next four to five days, coastal areas may receive moderate intensity rain. This northeast monsoon season will bring good rainfall to Tamil Nadu,” he said.Since Oct 1, Chennai has recorded 7 cm of rainfall, around 5% below normal, while Tamil Nadu logged 9cm, about 34% above normal. Kancheepuram recorded 10 cm (34% above normal), Tiruvallur 9cm (34% above), and Chengalpet 5cm (34% below).","IMD has forecast heavy rain of 6cm to 12cm in 24 hours in Chennai and 21 other districts.

“The (second) question is with the release of 1% workforce, the headcount declined by 20,000 people or 3%. And what you had announced earlier was 2%. So should we expect a similar kind of head count reduction in the next quarter as well?”

“So almost -- see, the 20,000 head count is a factor of voluntary and involuntary attrition.

So you should see that. But as we announced, against the 2 percentage, we have midway, so we have done approximately 1 percentage of it. And like what Krithi just mentioned, we don't have a target.”

“We are not chasing a target. We'll continue to evaluate everyone after all the investment in learning and development that we've done…..” he continued.





Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) HR head Sudeep Kunnumal recently addressed concerns over potential layoffs at the IT giant. Speaking during the company’s Q2 earnings call earlier this month, Kunnumal said that TCS is notwhen it comes to job cuts. Instead, the IT firm said it will evaluate “everyone”.During the earnings call, analyst Surendra Goyal from Citi asked:TCS HR head Sudeep Kunnumal replied to the question saying:Goyal further asked: “So just to clarify, there will be no involuntary attrition beyond the 1% number, is that understanding correct?”To this, Kunnumal replied: “No, no, I didn't say that. See, we estimate it to be 2%.We are currently at 1%, and we will continue to evaluate people whom we can redeploy -- whom we are not redeploy, and those are the people that we will release.”During the earnings call, TCS HR chief also talked about the new H-1B visa rule announced by Trump administration last month. Kunnumal said “...on H1B, we have significantly localized our workforce in the U.S. approximately just about 500 associates have traveled to the U.S. on H1B. We believe our business model will be able to adapt quickly to any changes in immigration policy.” US announced an annual fee of $100,000 on H-1B visa applications from September 21 onwards.Separately, the company has also announced a wage hike for over 80 percentage of our workforce with the effect from September 1.","Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) HR head Sudeep Kunnumal recently addressed concerns over potential layoffs at the IT giant.

AI’s real value lies ahead







Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu is the next to join the ongoing ‘AI bubble’ debate. Vembu has issued a cautionary warning on the present surge in artificial intelligence investments. He described the market as a ‘financial bubble’ that could distort long-term innovation. In an interview with CNBC-TV18, Vembu said that while AI holds enormous promise, the present wave of huge valuations and funding practices are becoming a cause on concern. “This boom makes me very uncomfortable,” he said. “While AI as a technology has enormous promise, much of today’s investment is speculative.”Along with this, Vembu also pointed to a round-tripping which a financial manoeuvre where companies fund each other to inflate revenue. This practice as per Vembu is a troubling trend for the AI sector. He further warned that such practices could lead to unsustainable valuations which is smilier to the past bubbles in dotcom and e-commerce. “Some people argue the multi-trillion-dollar valuations will be justified by productivity gains. But why aren’t those gains visible already?” he asked.However, despite all these concerns, Vembu stressed on the fact that the underlying technology of AI remains valuable and will continue to deliver real benefits in the long term.He advocates for measured, purpose-driven investment rather than hype-fueled speculation. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos may have agreed with Sam Altman over ‘AI Bubble’ warningRecently, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos also pointed out that the current surge of investment in artificial intelligence (AI) constitutes an “industrial bubble” but stressed that the underlying technology is ""real"" and will bring immense societal benefits. Similar comments have been previously made by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman who reportedly said earlier this year that he believes AI could be in a bubble but it’s “the most important thing to happen in a very long time”.“This is a kind of industrial bubble,” the Amazon founder said while speaking at Italian Tech Week.“The second thing that happens is that people get very excited like they are today about artificial intelligence,” Bezos added, noting that when they happen, stock prices are “disconnected from the fundamentals” of a business. He said that during bubbles, every experiment or idea gets funded.“The good ideas and the bad ideas. And investors have a hard time in the middle of this excitement, distinguishing between the good ideas and the bad ideas. And that’s also probably happening today,” Bezos said.","Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has issued a cautionary warning on the present surge in artificial intelligence investments.

Real-world application matters more than technological supremacy







Alibaba Group chairman Joe Tsai has challenged the prevailing narrative of US-China artificial intelligence competition, arguing that the race has no definitive winner because success should be measured by adoption speed rather than model superiority. ""When it comes to AI, there's no such thing as winning the race. It's a long marathon,"" Tsai said at the All-In Summit 2025 in September, with recordings posted Wednesday. He emphasised that the AI race isn't about who builds the biggest or most powerful model — it's about who can deploy AI faster.Tsai said the US should focus more on adoption and diffusion of AI instead of spending billions on developing larger models. He argued that ""every week there's a model that's leading, but then the next week another model overtakes them,"" making model superiority a fleeting achievement.The contrasting strategies between the two nations highlight fundamental differences in AI development philosophy. US tech companies have been spending billions, with Meta expecting to spend $600 billion on AI infrastructure through 2028, while OpenAI and Oracle announced plans for a $500 billion data center project.Meanwhile, China's AI play focuses on lean, efficient models — cheaper, lighter, and easier to deploy. DeepSeek's R1 model, which disrupted the AI industry and US stock market earlier this year, rivals top competitors but was built at a fraction of the cost.Tsai highlighted China as an example of faster adoption, noting companies are embracing open-source and smaller models optimised for real-world use on mobile devices and laptops.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang echoed similar concerns about America's adoption pace. Huang said China's under-regulation at the industrial level makes the country ""quick in adopting new technology,"" with the country aiming for 70% AI adoption by 2027.""I'm not saying China technologically is winning in the model war, but in terms of the actual application and also people benefiting from AI, it has made a lot of development,"" Tsai stated.Instead of trying to outbuild leading players like OpenAI, China focuses on rolling out AI across everyday tech at breakneck speed, which could prove just as crucial as model quality in determining overall AI competitiveness.",Alibaba Group chairman Joe Tsai has challenged the prevailing narrative of US- China artificial intelligence competition.

H-1B Visa Shock Explained: $100K Annual Fee Announced by Donald Trump

Top tech leaders who started their journey on an H-1B visa

Sundar Pichai – Alphabet and Google CEO

The H-1B visa programme has long served as a critical gateway for global talent to contribute to the United States’ economy, particularly in technology, healthcare, and academia, helping to fill key skill gaps and drive innovation. Recently, the Trump administration has signalled sweeping reforms beyond the previously proposed $100,000 mandatory fee, which has raised significant concerns among current H-1B holders, prospective applicants, and industry stakeholders. According to a note from the US Department of Homeland Security titled “Reforming the H-1B Nonimmigrant Visa Classification Program,” the administration is considering multiple changes, including revising eligibility for cap exemptions, increasing oversight of employers with prior violations, and tightening regulation of third-party job placements, as widely reported. These proposals are expected to be formally published in December this year, potentially reshaping application processes, affecting international talent mobility, and impacting US competitiveness in the global workforce landscape.Weeks before the proposed rule changes, President Donald Trump announced that employers would be required to pay a $100,000 fee for each H-1B visa application. This declaration caused immediate panic among the Indian diaspora and other foreign workers on H-1B visas.Many visa holders and their families, who were temporarily outside the US for work or travel, scrambled to return within 24 hours to avoid being stranded or denied entry. The situation eased slightly when White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt clarified that the fee would be a one-time charge applicable only to new petitions and not an annual cost. Despite this clarification, the proposed restrictions continue to generate concern among employers and employees alike, particularly in sectors heavily reliant on foreign talent.H-1B visa holders are not limited to tech roles; roughly a third work in essential sectors such as healthcare, education, religious services, and academia, as highlighted in a recent lawsuit challenging the reforms. Tech companies, in particular, fear that the reforms could disrupt hiring practices, limit access to high-skilled talent, and make the US less competitive on a global scale.Several prominent tech leaders began their US careers under the H-1B visa system, demonstrating its crucial role in fostering innovation and economic growth.Satya Nadella, born in Hyderabad, India, moved to the US in the early 1990s. He secured an H-1B visa to work at Microsoft, where he rose through the ranks to become CEO in 2014. Nadella has consistently highlighted the critical role of skilled immigrants in fostering innovation and growth, emphasizing that many of Microsoft's most transformative projects have been driven by talent brought to the US through the H-1B program.Sundar Pichai, originally from Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India, moved to the US for higher studies. After completing his education, he transitioned to an H-1B visa, which allowed him to join Google. Over the years, he rose to become CEO of Alphabet, overseeing key innovations in AI, Google Cloud, and hardware like Pixel phones and Nest devices. Pichai has emphasized that immigration has been instrumental in America's technological leadership and Google's success, and he has publicly advocated for policies that expand opportunities for skilled immigrants.Aravind Srinivas, born in Chennai, India, moved to the US for higher education and later transitioned to an H-1B visa. He is the founder and CEO of Perplexity AI, a company specializing in generative AI. Despite challenges posed by immigration policies, Srinivas underscores that the US remains a meritocratic environment where talent and innovation are recognized. He emphasizes that the primary challenge for immigrants is not the increase in H-1B visa fees but finding trustworthy mentors and investors.Jayshree Ullal, originally from London and New Delhi, moved to the US at 16 to pursue higher education. She began her career on an H-1B visa and rose through several top tech companies to become CEO of Arista Networks. Ullal has been a vocal advocate for the H-1B visa program, emphasizing its importance in attracting global talent to the US She has also highlighted the challenges of the US immigration process, noting the long wait times for permanent residence approvals.Arvind Krishna, hailing from Dehradun, India, moved to the US in the 1990s on an H-1B visa. He steadily advanced to become CEO of IBM. Krishna has consistently advocated for the US to remain an international talent hub, stressing that global collaboration and access to foreign talent are essential for innovation and economic competitiveness.The H-1B visa programme has historically enabled the United States to attract some of the world’s brightest minds, driving innovation and economic expansion across multiple sectors. As proposed reforms take shape, leaders like Satya Nadella, Sundar Pichai, Aravind Srinivas, Jayshree Ullal, and Arvind Krishna illustrate the tangible benefits of such a programme. Any policy changes must strike a careful balance between national interests, global competitiveness, and the livelihoods of millions of skilled workers who contribute to the US economy.","The H-1B visa programme has long served as a critical gateway for global talent to contribute to the United States’ economy.

MUMBAI: A 72-year-old businessman dealing in stocks lost Rs 58 crore in a cyber scam where he and his wife were put under ‘digital arrest’ by fraudsters posing as ED and CBI officials who threatened to prosecute them for money laundering.Police officers say this is perhaps the highest amount someone’s coughed up for fear of prosecution. Police have arrested a trio who forged documents, impersonated govt officers on video calls, and used fake credentials to convince the victim he was under investigation for money laundering, and coercing him into transferring money into multiple bank accounts over two months beginning Aug this year. The accused got Rs 25 lakh in each of their personal accounts, said a senior cop.The complainant (name withheld) was first contacted on Aug 19 by callers identifying themselves as Subramaniam and Karan Sharma. They used multiple mobile numbers and made WhatsApp video calls, claiming to represent CBI and other agencies. Using the fake documents along with threats of “digital arrest”, the accused coerced the man and his wife to transfer funds “for investigation clearance” in a money laundering case.The Maharashtra nodal cyber team identified the trio as Abdul Nasir Khulli (47), a resident of Pathanwadi, Malad, Arjun Kadwasara (55), a steel trader from Chira Bazaar, and his brother Jetharam Kadwasara (35), a resident of Bhadkamkar Road, Mumbai Central, who defrauded a 72-year-old businessman of Rs 58 core in a case of digital arrest scam Between Aug 19 and Oct 8, 2025, the businessman transferred a total of ?58.13 crore through RTGS to several bank accounts provided by the accused. By the time the victim realised he had been conned, the money was already siphoned off.The investigation showed that the funds were routed through 18 different bank accounts across Maharashtra and other states. One key account belonged to Aircool Enterprises, held with a private bank, registered in the name of Afreen Khulli, wife of accused Abdul Nasir. Around ?25 lakh was found to have been moved from this account to seven others.Further analysis traced Rs 24.95 lakh to Meghdoot Trading Company, a firm linked to accused Arjun Kadwasara, whose bank account with the bank in Mazgaon Branch was used to launder the proceeds. The transactions were allegedly managed by Jetharam Kadwasara, who also handled withdrawals.The probe established that Abdul Nasir handled operations on instructions from one Ankit Shah, suspected to be operating from Gujarat. Nasir travelled to Gujarat and Rajasthan in late Sept 2025, allegedly to manage fund transfers and create new money channels.Police said that the accused were booked under sections of BNS of cheating, forgery, impersonation, and criminal intimidation, along with Sections 66(c) and 66(d) of the Information Technology Act. Police have also frozen all identified bank accounts and initiated correspondence with multiple financial institutions through official cybercrime channels to trace the rest of the network.The probe is being carried out by a team of police inspector Abhijit Sonawane, DIG Sanjay Shintre, and Additional DG Yashasvi Yadav. Cyber teams from Thane, Gujarat, and Rajasthan have been roped in to track digital evidence and money movement linked to the racket.",Police say this is perhaps the highest amount someone’s coughed up for fear of prosecution.

Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmark indices, opened in green on Thursday. While Nifty50 was above 25,400, BSE Sensex was up over 300 points. At 9:18 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 25,410.10, up 87 points or 0.34%.

China’s tough actions regarding the rare earth magnets have hit the US hard and, therefore, the US is keen on striking a deal with India with both countries making some concessions. ”“Even though Indian macros are robust and GDP growth projection for FY26 is being revised up, India’s exports and jobs in labour intensive areas like textiles, gems and jewellery and leather products have been hit hard. In this context, a US-India trade deal will be a big boost to the markets.The low CPI inflation of 1.54% in September and the possibility of FY26 annual inflation declining to 2.6% open up the possibility of further rate cuts by the MPC. This, in turn, will boost the prospects of rate sensitives particularly automobiles, which are likely to experience sustained high demand for an extended period of time.”The S&P 500 finished higher on Wednesday, with Morgan Stanley and Bank of America shares rising after strong quarterly performances, whilst investors monitored escalating China-US trade friction.Asian equities increased at opening following US market gains in a fluctuating session as investors assessed new US-China trade developments.Oil prices increased approximately 1% during early trading Thursday after US President Donald Trump claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi committed to halting Russian oil purchases, which currently constitute one-third of India's imports.Gold achieved a new peak Thursday as investors sought safety in the precious metal during ongoing geopolitical and economic uncertainties, supported by anticipated US interest rate reductions and declining dollar strength.Foreign portfolio investors sold shares worth Rs 68 crore net on Wednesday.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

'BRICS Was Attack On US Dollar': Donald Trump Blasts India, China, Russia Amid Tariffs. Here's Why

Poll Do you think BRICS’ growing influence could impact global trade dynamics? Yes No





US President Donald Trump on Wednesday detailed his tariff strategy against Brics , claiming the bloc was “against the dollar” and saying countries were “dropping out.”“I told anybody who wants to be in Brics, that's fine, but we're going to put tariffs on your nation,” Trump said. “Everybody dropped out. They're all dropping out of Brics. Brics was an attack on the dollar and I said, you want to play that game, I'm going to put tariffs on all of your products coming into the US. They said, like I said, we're dropping out of Brics...They don't even talk about it anymore.”Just days earlier, India had urged Brics nations to uphold the multilateral trading system and adhere to international law - a move seen as a pushback against the protectionist measures promoted by Trump’s MAGA-driven America. The appeal risks fresh friction with a US President increasingly vocal in his hostility towards the non-Western economic grouping.Trump has repeatedly attacked Brics in the past, portraying it as a challenge to US economic dominance. The grouping, originally formed by Brazil, Russia, India, and China, has now expanded to ten full members: Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, UAE, and Indonesia.Ten others are partner states -- including Belarus, Bolivia, and Malaysia -- while another ten, such as Pakistan and Sri Lanka, have applied for membership.The rapid expansion of Brics has rattled Washington. Trump has cast it as a direct threat to the dollar’s global reserve status, insisting the bloc was “set up to hurt us” and to “degenerate our dollar.”Even as New Delhi clarified that it does not support de-dollarisation, Trump issued a fresh warning -- threatening a 100 percent tariff on Brics nations if they pursued that path.","'BRICS Was Attack On US Dollar': Donald Trump Blasts India, China, Russia Amid Tariffs.

A US federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Donald Trump administration from laying off federal employees amid the ongoing government shutdown.Judge Susan Illston described the planned cuts as ""illegal"" and ""exceeding authority."" During a Wednesday hearing in San Francisco, she pressed the assistant US attorney to justify the more than 4,100 layoff notices sent across eight government agencies, despite furloughed workers lacking access to their work emails and HR support.“It is very much ready, fire, aim on most of these programmes, and it has a human cost that cannot be tolerated. The evidence would ultimately show the cuts were illegal and in excess of authority,” Illston remarked, according to The Associated Press.The restraining order was issued in response to a petition from the American Federation of Government Employees and other federal labour unions, who sought to block both new and previously issued layoff notices.The shutdown, which began on October 1, entered its third week amid a stalemate between the Republicans and Democrats. Democratic lawmakers are demanding that any funding deal include healthcare provisions, while House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican, warned the shutdown could become the “longest in history” and said he “will not negotiate” until Democrats pause their demands.Lawmakers are seeking an extension of healthcare subsidies first introduced in 2021 and renewed a year later, as well as a reversal of Medicaid cuts included in Trump’s recent tax and spending legislation.","Judge Susan Illston described the planned cuts as ""illegal"" and ""exceeding authority"" She pressed the assistant US attorney to justify the more than 4,100 layoff notices sent across eight government agencies.

Strategic hedging, not endorsement







NEW DELHI: In a diplomatic manoeuvre that could reshape regional equations, India announced on Friday that it will upgrade its technical mission in Kabul to a full-fledged embassy. The decision was announced during Taliban foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi’s high-profile visit to New Delhi. On the same day, the Afghan foreign minister, from Indian soil, condemned Pakistan for bombing civilian areas in Paktika, Afghanistan — the first of its kind that came against the backdrop of escalating tensions between Kabul and Islamabad.During the meetings, external affairs minister S Jaishankar underlined that India’s engagement “contributes to Afghanistan’s national development, as well as regional stability and resilience,” while announcing a fresh round of development projects across Afghan provinces. The upgrade of India’s technical mission to a full-fledged embassy signals a significant deepening of diplomatic ties without extending formal recognition to the Taliban regime.Later the same day, Muttaqi held a press briefing in New Delhi, sharply condemning Pakistan for bombing civilian areas in Paktika, calling it a “provocative act” and a violation of Afghanistan’s sovereignty. “Such issues cannot be resolved by strength.Countries with disputes should resolve them internally. Peace and prosperity are good for all,” he said, stressing the widening rift between Kabul and Islamabad.India had shut its Kabul embassy in August 2021 after the Taliban’s return to power, maintaining only a skeletal presence through a technical team since June 2022 to oversee humanitarian aid. The embassy upgrade marks the deepest level of engagement between India and the Taliban since the fall of the Ashraf Ghani government. This move stops short of formal recognition but signals a decisive shift in India’s Afghanistan strategy.The timing of the announcement was significant. It came just hours after Afghanistan’s defence ministry accused Pakistan of bombing civilian areas in Paktika near the Durand Line. “Pakistan violated Afghanistan’s airspace, bombing a civilian market in the Marghi area of Paktika near the Durand Line and also violating Kabul’s sovereign territory,” the ministry said in a post on social media. Calling it “an unprecedented, violent, and provocative act”, Kabul warned that defending its territory is its right.From Indian soil, Muttaqi chose to respond sharply. “I think it’s a wrong step by the Pakistan government. Such issues cannot be resolved by strength. Countries with disputes should resolve them internally. Peace and prosperity are good for all,” he told reporters in Delhi. “Some attacks happened in border areas, and we condemn them. We have opened doors for dialogue and diplomacy.”The unusually strong language stressed the widening rift between the Taliban and Pakistan, their uneasy patron for decades. Relations have deteriorated over Islamabad’s military operations against Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters allegedly sheltering in Afghanistan. In March 2024, Pakistani airstrikes in Khost and Paktika killed several civilians, triggering warnings from Kabul of “consequences”. This fracture, analysts say, has created a new strategic opening for India.India has historically had a fraught relationship with the Taliban. During the 1990s, New Delhi backed the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance while Islamabad openly supported the Taliban regime. After 2001, India became one of Afghanistan’s largest regional donors, pledging over USD 3 billion for development projects. But the Taliban’s return to power in 2021 disrupted India’s presence and leverage in the country. New Delhi maintained limited contact, focusing on humanitarian assistance and regional coordination with Iran and Central Asian partners.Now, with Pakistan–Taliban ties fraying, India is recalibrating. By reopening its embassy, hosting Muttaqi, and accepting Taliban-appointed diplomats (though not at the ambassadorial level), India is signalling a willingness to engage without granting formal recognition. Strategic analysts describe this as “hedging” — positioning itself to gain influence should Pakistan’s grip weaken further, while safeguarding its own security concerns.Professor Rajan Kumar of the School of International Studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University says this evolving situation presents India with a rare diplomatic opening.“The ongoing conflict with Afghanistan and Pakistan certainly offers an opportunity for India can be a stabilising factor even in the ongoing conflict with Pakistan. India’s presence matters a lot to Afghanistan because it will provide some kind of legitimacy to the Taliban government, even though India is unlikely to recognise the regime as such,” he says.The engagement carried clear economic undertones as well. Muttaqi invited Indian companies to invest in Afghanistan’s mining sector and called for the opening of the Attari–Wagah border for direct India–Afghanistan trade. “Pakistan and India should open the Wagah border to facilitate trade between Afghanistan and India. It will benefit the people of all three countries,” he said.Currently, India trades with Afghanistan primarily via Iran’s Chabahar port due to Pakistan’s denial of overland access. But the route faces uncertainty after the United States revoked India’s sanctions waiver for Chabahar in September 2024, complicating transit. While Chabahar remains a strategic hedge, its operational limitations make direct India–Afghanistan connectivity via Pakistan attractive in theory — though politically fraught.India also announced a new slate of development projects: a Thalassemia Centre and 30-bed hospital in Bagrami district, oncology and trauma centres in Kabul, maternity clinics across Paktika, Khost and Paktia, and donations of ambulances, medical equipment and vaccines. These announcements draw on India’s legacy of over 500 development projects across all 34 Afghan provinces, including the Parliament building and the Salma Dam.Security remains at the core of India’s engagement. Without naming Pakistan, both sides “unequivocally condemned all acts of terrorism emanating from regional countries” in their joint statement. Jaishankar said, “We have a common commitment towards growth and prosperity. However, these are endangered by the shared threat of cross-border terrorism that both our nations face. We must coordinate efforts to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.” Muttaqi, meanwhile, pledged that Afghanistan “won’t allow any group to use the country against others”, identifying Daesh (ISIS) as the main regional threat.For India, the key is ensuring Afghan soil is not used for anti-India activities — a core concern since the IC-814 hijacking in 1999. Prof. Kumar explains this strategic bottom line:“What can happen, and what India is probably thinking, is that the land of Afghanistan may not be used for terrorist activities against India. That would be a huge achievement from the Indian perspective,” he says.India has so far avoided pressing the Taliban hard on human rights. Muttaqi remained vague when asked about women’s rights, saying, “All countries have their own customs and traditions and these should be respected.” While India has consistently raised rights issues at multilateral forums, officials have avoided making them a precondition for engagement.Perhaps the most consequential element of India’s strategy is its decision to reopen its embassy in Kabul without formally recognising the Taliban regime — a nuanced diplomatic line that gives New Delhi both flexibility and leverage. By restoring a physical diplomatic presence, India can deepen engagement on the ground and signal its relevance in Afghanistan’s evolving power dynamics, without extending official legitimacy to a government that remains internationally unrecognised and controversial for its human rights record.This approach reflects a clear distinction between establishing an embassy and granting diplomatic recognition. India has previously maintained similar diplomatic arrangements, such as with Palestine, where the presence of an embassy does not automatically translate into full diplomatic recognition of a government. In the Afghan context, this allows India to engage pragmatically while aligning its policy with the broader stance of the United Nations, the European Union and Western countries, most of which have opted for functional engagement without recognition.By doing so, New Delhi positions itself strategically. It can build channels of communication, potentially shape outcomes on critical security and connectivity issues, and apply pressure on regional actors like Pakistan and China, both of which are wary of India expanding its influence in Afghanistan. At the same time, India avoids prematurely endorsing a regime whose policies on women’s rights and governance remain at odds with international norms.India’s outreach is also informed by broader regional considerations. Russia and China have already established working relationships with the Taliban. Western governments are engaged in dialogue on counterterrorism and aid. New Delhi, analysts say, does not want to be the outlier.As Prof. Kumar notes, “Since Russia is talking, China is already there, and American and Western governments are also talking, India should not be left out. We may have ideological differences with the Taliban regime, but since other countries are talking to the Taliban in different forms, we should also try to moderate our policy and engage on several issues.”This balancing act is not without challenges. The Taliban regime remains ideologically rigid, especially on women’s rights and governance. Connectivity through Chabahar faces geopolitical headwinds. And there is no guarantee that the Taliban will limit anti-India groups indefinitely. Yet, by opening formal diplomatic channels, India aims to secure a seat at the table rather than watch from the sidelines as others shape Afghanistan’s future.Muttaqi’s visit to Delhi, marked by strong rhetoric against Pakistan, overtures for trade, and assurances on terrorism, reflects Kabul’s attempt to diversify its diplomatic bets. For India, the outreach is less about endorsing the Taliban regime and more about strategic positioning: insulating itself against security risks, reasserting influence in a region long dominated by Pakistan, and adapting to a shifting geopolitical landscape.New Delhi’s approach remains cautious but deliberate. It is engaging the Taliban to pursue its security and strategic objectives, without abandoning its normative concerns or rushing into recognition. In the complex triangle of India–Afghanistan–Pakistan, this marks the beginning of a new phase — one where India is no longer merely reacting to developments in Kabul, but actively shaping them.","India announced on Friday that it will upgrade its technical mission in Kabul to a full-fledged embassy.

India Spreading False Narratives About Hindu Attacks in Bangladesh: Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus





A fire broke out at a garment factory and adjoining chemical warehouse in Bangladesh’s capital Dhaka, killed at least nine people and injured several others on Tuesday, according to fire service officials, reported AP.The blaze erupted in the Mirpur area and is believed to have started on the third floor of a seven-storey building housing a garment facility, said Talha bin Jashim, a senior fire official. The cause of the fire is yet to be confirmed.Rescue workers had recovered nine bodies by late evening and warned that the death toll could rise. “Several other people have been injured,” Jashim said.The fire was brought under control by evening, though rescue and recovery operations were to continuing late into the night.Bangladesh is the second-largest garment exporter globally after China. The sector employs around four million people, the majority of them women, and contributes nearly $40 billion annually to the country’s export earnings, mainly from the US and Europe.The industry has long faced scrutiny for industrial safety standards. Several past accidents, including fires and building collapses, have been attributed to poor oversight and violations of safety and construction codes.(With inputs from agencies)","A fire broke out at a garment factory and adjoining chemical warehouse in Bangladesh’s capital Dhaka, killed at least nine people and injured several others.

Only Hindu temple in East of England faces closure threat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/only-hindu-temple-in-east-of-england-faces-closure-threat/articleshow/124561089.cms,".





LONDON: The only Hindu temple in East of England, which serves 13,500 Hindus, is at risk of closure because the local authority has put the building it is in up for sale.The Bharat Hindu Samaj Temple was established in the New England Complex in Peterborough in 1984 and serves Hindus in Cambridgeshire, Norfolk and parts of Lincolnshire.Peterborough City Council owns the building and wants to sell it to pay off debts.The temple put in its bid by the deadline of Monday night to buy the entire complex of seven units.Kishor Ladwa, president of the temple, said it had a bid of £1.3 million for the complex agreed in April with the council offering a £504,000 discount for the social value of its services. Then, in Sept, the council said it had other buyers and could not offer them the complex for that amount and asked them to increase their bid. The council has not disclosed who the other bidders are but indicated they are community organisations.“We don’t want to be someone’s tenant. The council never sent us a legally binding contract to buy the site. We would have signed it immediately,” Ladwa said. “We have been negotiating to buy the temple for 14 years but the council keeps shifting its goalposts.”The temple is an important social hub for the elderly, offering luncheons twice a week, and dementia and diabetic workshops.It also offers Bollywood dance, yoga, Zumba, Hindi and Gujarati classes. “Some of the elderly are lonely and this is the only social place to meet their own friends,” Ladwa said.There was a huge week-long procession when the idols were consecrated there, so how can they be moved if they have to go to another site, he asks.Ekta Patel, tempe vice-president, said: “We are saving the council millions of pounds in public services through the activities we are providing for the elderly. We don’t want to be in a situation where someone can evict us.”Petitions have sprung up garnering thousands of signatures calling for the sale to be stopped.Councillor Mohammed Jamil, cabinet member for finance and corporate governance at the council, said: “We understand that this must be a worrying time for the Hindu community. However, we have to put all community assets we have identified to sell on the open market to ensure we achieve the best possible value for taxpayers. If the Bharat Hindu Samaj is not the preferred bidder, responsibility for its tenancy would transfer to the new owner, and they would continue to have rights and protections under the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1954, but would need to seek their own legal advice. ”","The Bharat Hindu Samaj Temple was established in the New England Complex in Peterborough in 1984.

3I/Atlas and rising UFO sightings: Could an interstellar visitor be watching Earth







As rumours continue to swirl around the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, many enthusiasts are asking which regions in the UK have recorded the highest number of UFO sightings. While sceptics remain cautious, a significant portion of the population believes that humanity may not be alone in the universe. Speculations range from encounters with Greys and insectoid beings to humanoid creatures resembling cats, often described as possessing intelligence and wisdom beyond ordinary imagination.Public interest in UFO phenomena has surged in recent years, particularly following the release of declassified documents by the US Government. Discussions intensified with the discovery of 3I/ATLAS, only the third interstellar object ever detected passing through our solar system. Initially identified as a comet, some researchers have suggested that its unusual trajectory and physical characteristics might point to something more extraordinary. Avi Loeb, a prominent astrophysicist, has even speculated that it could be an alien probe on a reconnaissance mission. Despite these theories, the majority of the scientific community classifies it as a comet, yet its enigmatic behaviour continues to fuel debates surrounding extraterrestrial life.As reported by Peterborough Telegraph, to identify the top UFO hotspots in the UK, Casino.org compiled user-submitted reports from three independent sources: the National UFO Reporting Centre (NUFORC), the Enigma app, and the UFO Identified Group. Each report was counted per region, then adjusted for population density using the latest UK census data. This per capita approach highlights areas where residents are proportionally most likely to report UFO sightings, rather than simply presenting raw numbers.By analysing thousands of sightings across multiple years, researchers aimed to reveal patterns and trends that could indicate unusually high UFO activity in specific locations.It is important to note that rankings are based on subjective accounts and may be influenced by local population sizes and reporting cultures. While these figures provide a useful insight into UFO activity, they do not constitute definitive proof of extraterrestrial visitation.Southampton’s UFO sightings are largely concentrated around Southampton Water and the Solent. Observers have reported unusual aerial phenomena above shipping lanes, the city centre, and the New Forest.Leeds has a notable concentration of sightings in its green spaces, including Roundhay Park and Harewood House. Reports also frequently emerge along the River Aire, often describing bright, moving lights.In Leominster, most UFO reports originate from rural areas outside the town, particularly near Queenswood Country Park and over the River Lugg. Witnesses often describe objects hovering silently or moving at high speeds.Preston’s sightings are primarily near Moor Park and the University of Central Lancashire campus. Unusual lights are occasionally seen over the River Ribble, prompting speculation among local UFO enthusiasts.In Exeter, UFO activity has been recorded over the Exeter Ship Canal, Exeter Quay, and the outskirts leading toward Dartmoor National Park. Observers report strange formations and sudden appearances in the sky.The majority of Waterlooville’s reports come from areas surrounding the South Downs National Park and rural regions near Cowplain. Witnesses describe fast-moving lights and hovering objects that defy conventional explanation.Cannock Chase and the skies above the River Sow are notable hotspots for UFO activity in Stafford. Sightings often involve glowing lights that seem to change direction abruptly.Manchester’s UFO reports are frequently centred around Piccadilly Gardens, the Northern Quarter, and the River Irwell. Observers describe unusual aerial movements that are difficult to attribute to conventional aircraft.Norwich has emerged as a prominent location for unexplained aerial phenomena, with frequent sightings over the Norfolk Broads, Norwich Cathedral, and Norwich Castle. Witnesses report rapid lights and objects appearing at varying altitudes.Llandudno ranks as the UK’s most active region for UFO reports. Sightings are concentrated around the Great Orme and Llandudno Pier, with multiple accounts of strange lights moving swiftly over the Irish Sea.The recent attention on UFO sightings in the UK coincides with the discovery of 3I/ATLAS. This third interstellar object ever detected has captured public imagination due to its unusual trajectory and characteristics. While mainstream science considers it a comet, some theorists, including Avi Loeb, have suggested it could be an alien probe sent to observe Earth. Regardless of its origin, the object has intensified curiosity about extraterrestrial life and increased UFO reporting across the country.","Public interest in UFO phenomena has surged in recent years, particularly following the release of declassified documents by the US Government.
