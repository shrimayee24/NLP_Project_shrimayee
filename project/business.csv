‘No Choice But To Flee’

A History of Violence

Fight For Survival

A Question Of Identity

Still

Stateless

Waiting On CAA

Bijoy Das was 20 when he found himself left in the middle of the treacherous Dandakaranya forests of central India. More than 50 years later, he still shudders to think of the circumstances that forced him and countless other Hindus to leave their ancestral home in the then East Pakistan and seek refuge in India. Circumstances that are echoed again in the reports of violence against minorities in Bangladesh following the recent ouster of PM Sheikh Hasina.As more Bangladeshi Hindus mass at the border to seek shelter in a new country, the settlers from the previous decades find themselves reliving their story of loss, displacement and the long wait for legal recognition from Indian govt.Now 72, Das’s voice still quavers when he recalls the funeral of his sister back in his village. “They dragged her away. She kept screaming for help. As a young boy, I could only stand petrified. She was raped and killed. Her name was Dulaan. We later found her body in the river,” he says staring out of the window of his hut in Pakhanjore village on the southern tip of the Maoist heartland of Bastar. The area is more than 1,400km away from the home he left behind by the banks of Laukhati river, 250km from Dhaka.Standing next to Das, an elderly Somaresh Singha recounts a chilling tale of escape. “My father walked out of his burning home in a burqa, helped by sympathetic Muslim neighbours in Charbat village in Faridpur district. Mobs were on a killing spree and had kidnapped scores of girls. There was no choice but to flee,” he says.Das and Singha’s families crossed over to India on foot. Once here, they were bundled into trains or trucks and brought to Mana tran- sit camp near Raipur, then in Madhya Pradesh (now part of Chhattisgarh). After sheltering for months in tents in dense forests, they were settled in hamlets that are now part of the Maoist Red corridor. There are 2.8 lakh East Bengali refugees spread across 300 camps in these forests, including in Maharashtra’s Gadchiroli district.The killing and persecution in East Pakistan had begun long before the world woke up to it in 1971. The 1964 Dhaka riots, sparked by Kashmir’s Hazratbal shrine incident, pointed to East Pakistan’s descent into intolerance. Operation Searchlight of 1970-71, led by Pakistani army and Razakar militia, marked a period of unspeakable agony for millions of Bengali Hindus.Kalikrishna Biswas, 75, whose entire family was massacred, says “the Razakar militia unleashed by the Pakistan army were brutal”. As violence increased, lakhs fled with nothing but the clothes on their backs.Amar Mandal, originally from Khulna district, recalls crossing the Padma river at night, wading through waterlogged fields as mothers pressed down on their children’s mouths to muffle cries that could betray their presence. He was separated for years from his father, who had stayed back. “One day, a telegram came from my father. He was standing at the Indian border, having borrowed money to reach there. He was lucky to be reunited with his family in Gadchiroli,” says Mandal.But the struggle for Mandal and the thousands like him didn’t end when they reached India. As they tried to start a new life, they found they had a new threat to deal with inside the dense forests. “Many children and elderly were mauled by tigers. There DhakaBangladesh Kolkata 1,400km is not a single village where people didn’t fall prey to wild animals. Slowly, we cleared the forests and made the place habitable and grew crops,” says Sunil Biswas, a settler since 1970. But the land was infertile and the produce barely enough to feed their families. “After each harvest, we would look for odd jobs to make ends meet,” he adds.Many refugees sought to return to the newly formed Bangladesh post 1971, but efforts in that direction proved abortive. Biswas says the 1979 ‘Marichjhapi massacre’ in the Sundarbans “by police in Leftruled West Bengal doused any hope of getting closer home”. “We took Dandakaranya to be our abode and made peace with the wild,” he adds.But relations with the local tribals have been testy. “Initially, the adivasis were indifferent towards us, but tensions have grown over the years,” says one of the settlers. Sporadic campaigns to oust refugees have sparked fears among settlers. “We are scared. We pray that Pakhanjore does not end up becoming like Bangladesh,” he says.The residents of these refugee hamlets have held on to their Bengali culture and beliefs. In ‘Ghot’ or village No.53, the sound of evening prayers echoes through the air. A red ‘gamcha’ tied with rice and jaggery — a lucky charm — adorns each doorway. Inside, images of ‘Lokkhi Thakur’ (Goddess Laxmi) grace the walls.Settlers in Dandakaranya can be divided into two groups: those who came via official channels from East Pakistan between 1964 and 1971, and those who migrated after the formation of Bangladesh in 1971. The first group received a ‘border slip’ as proof of their refugee status. Others settled without documents. Some managed to carry only a few valuables or just the family deity or a photograph.For first-generation refugees like Jyotishchandra Sarkar, the effort to establish a home has been lifelong. “We broke rocks, cleared forests and built a liveable place in the wilds,” says Sarkar, now 87. Today, the border slip of 1985 is his only identity proof.Sukhendu Chakraborty, 68, a resident of Ghot No.20 in Gadchiroli, says they managed to flourish “despite the identity crisis and acute hardships”. “In those years, there was hardly any govt footprint here. Nowadays, officials and netas visit these forests with commandos and minesweepers. But we made peace with nature and the inhabitants. Adversity has hardened our will to survive, but we pray for stability and recognition,” he says.Decades after they arrived in India, Chakraborty and countless others remain stateless. They cultivated the land, raised families, and found a livelihood, but the struggle to become Indian citizens continues.Many have managed to find a footing, some have benefited from govt programmes that gave them jobs, land and the chance to build small businesses and farms. However, their progress has not been without setbacks. Bengali medium schools, which were once specially set up by the govt for refugee children, have been shut down while many claim they are excluded from govt schemes. Many settlers till the land without official ownership.“We have lived here for decades, but we are still waiting for recognition,” Bipin Bepari, a member of Nikhil Bharat Bangali Samanbay Samiti (NBBSS), voices the frustration of many.Jatin Karmakar (name changed), a grocery shop owner, is euphoric that his son landed a corporate job. While he leads a regular life in India, complexities still surround his legal status. “I have an Aadhaar card and a voter ID, but I am still not an Indian citizen,” he says. Settlers say they need the bor der slip for citizenship documentation, which Karmakar doesn’t have.Kalikrishna Ghose came to India in 1982 but, like many others, finds himself occupying a grey zone when it comes to citizenship. “I came through an agent. There are many in Bangladesh who help you cross the border. After staying in Kolkata for a while, I settled in Chamorshi in Gadchiroli in 1989, where my kin were already living,” he says.The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) seemed like a beacon of hope for these refugees. CAA, enacted in 2019, paves the way to Indian citizenship for religious minorities from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan who arrived in India by 2014. However, many settlers have found the process difficult, especially those who lack documents to prove their eligibility. “Many are not applying because they don’t have documents,” says Subhodh Biswas, president of NBBSS. Of 221 applications filed by them so far under CAA, only six were successful.The ongoing political turmoil in Bangladesh has triggered another wave of attacks on Bengali Hindus. “My brother keeps calling me on WhatsApp, asking me to come and take him to India,” says Krishna Bose of Chamorshi. “No one is buying our property there. They want Hindus to abandon everything and leave so it can be an easy smash-and-grab,” he says.Recently, about 10,000 Bengali settlers gathered at Pakhanjore and urged the Centre to open its borders for Hindus from Bangladesh. Biswas says his outfit plans to hold similar rallies across Bengali pockets before launching an agitation on Sept 23 at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi.","More than 2.8 lakh East Bengali refugees spread across 300 camps in these forests, including in Maharashtra’s Gadchiroli district.

Why should birth control measures target Hindus only: RSS magazine's editor Prafulla Ketkar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-should-birth-control-measures-target-hindus-only-rss-mags-editor/articleshow/113360151.cms,"Prafulla Ketkar, editor of RSS-affiliated magazine Organiser, questioned why population control measures target only Hindus and called for increased social awareness among them.

NAGPUR: Why should only Hindus be subjected to population control measures, questioned the editor of RSS-affiliated magazine Organiser, Prafulla Ketkar , on Saturday.""The proportion of Hindus has reduced to 75% due to a Hindu mindset. There is a need to create social awareness by changing the narrative about birth control . Today, many families have lost confidence in the institution of marriage.Even when they marry, couples often choose to have only one child,"" he said.Ketkar argued that maintaining the country's demographic balance requires awakening among Hindus. He claimed that concept of birth control was a strategy by foreign forces to reduce the population, which, he said, is the country's most significant asset.He noted that the birth control campaign led by late Congress functionary Sanjay Gandhi was funded by Ford Foundation and questioned what the American organisation aimed to achieve through this.Ketkar also criticised evangelist forces and neo-Left groups, who label the fight against religious fundamentalism as Islamophobia, suggesting that they are acting against India.Responding to a question whether India needed to prepare civilians for a situation similar to Israel's, he said that the Agniveer scheme was introduced with that purpose in mind. The scheme aims to produce military-trained individuals who can be deployed in a crisis, he told TOI on the sidelines of his talk on ""Global Uncertainties and Resurgent Bharat,"" organised by NGO Vishwamanthan Research Foundation.","Ketkar argued that maintaining the country's demographic balance requires awakening among Hindus.

Cyclonic circulation over Bangladesh: Depression over North India

Week 1: September 12 to 18

Week 2: September 19 to 25



NEW DELHI: A depression that formed over central India is predicted to cause heavy to extremely heavy rainfall in Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, and nearby regions in the coming two to three days, according to the India Meteorological Department ( IMD ).The latest IMD update indicated that the system was situated approximately 50 kilometres south-southeast of Agra and 50 kilometres north-northeast of Gwalior.It is anticipated to continue moving towards the north-northeast and gradually weaken on Friday. However, its impact will be felt across a wide region before it dissipates.From September 12 to 14, the state is anticipated to experience light to moderate rainfall, with isolated areas receiving heavy to extremely heavy precipitation. This could lead to localized flooding, landslides, and waterlogging in vulnerable areas.Both eastern and western regions are expected to face heavy to extremely heavy rainfall during this period. The IMD has warned of moderate to high flash flood risks , particularly in west Uttar Pradesh. Rainfall intensity could reach between 115.6 mm and 204.4 mm (very heavy) and exceed 204.5 mm (extremely heavy).Additionally, very heavy rainfall is expected in isolated areas of Delhi on the 12th, as well as in West Uttar Pradesh on both the 12th and 13th of September.Light to moderate rain is forecasted, with periods of heavy rainfall expected between September 12 and 15. Urban areas may face disruptions due to waterlogging and potential flooding.West Rajasthan is likely to receive heavy rainfall on September 12, while east Rajasthan will experience heavy to very heavy rainfall on September 12 and 13.Heavy rainfall is expected on September 12, with moderate to heavy rain continuing over the following days. This may result in surface runoff and flooding in low-lying areas.The depression follows a period of substantial rainfall across central India. From September 5 to 11, 2024, extreme heavy rainfall was reported in Chhattisgarh, Odisha, and Madhya Pradesh, with very heavy rainfall in Gujarat and East Rajasthan. The cumulative all-India rainfall for this period was 50.9 mm, which is 14% above the long period average (LPA). The seasonal rainfall departure from June 1 to September 11, 2024, stands at +8% above the LPA.The current system is not classified as a cyclone because it does not meet the intensity criteria set for cyclones. While it has brought significant rainfall and has the potential for severe weather, it lacks the sustained high wind speeds and organised cyclonic circulation typical of tropical cyclones.According to IMD, the depression that was previously over Northwest Madhya Pradesh has moved north-northeastwards at a speed of 10 km/h in the past six hours. By 8:30 AM IST on 12th September, it was positioned over Southwest Uttar Pradesh, near 27.0°N latitude and 78.5°E longitude, approximately 50 km east-southeast of Agra. It continued its movement north-northeastwards, accelerating to 13 km/h, and by 11:30 AM IST, it was centred near 27.3°N latitude and 78.7°E longitude, about 70 km east-northeast of Agra, 90 km southeast of Aligarh, 130 km north-northeast of Gwalior, and 140 km south-southwest of Bareilly. The system is expected to maintain its strength through the 12th of September before gradually weakening on the 13th. Continuous monitoring is being carried out by Doppler Weather Radars based in Delhi and Lucknow.An upper-air cyclonic circulation has formed over Southeast Bangladesh and its neighbouring regions in the lower and middle levels of the troposphere. A low-pressure area is expected to develop over coastal Bangladesh and the northern Bay of Bengal within the next 24 hours. Following this, the system is predicted to slowly move west-northwestwards, potentially strengthening into a depression over coastal West Bengal and the adjoining northwest Bay of Bengal within 48 hours.Extremely heavy rainfall is forecast for isolated regions of Uttarakhand on the 12th and 13th of September, while West Uttar Pradesh is expected to experience similar conditions on the 12th, with continued heavy rain on the 13th. Other regions, including Haryana, Chandigarh-Delhi, East Uttar Pradesh, West Madhya Pradesh, and East Rajasthan, are likely to see isolated heavy rainfall on the 12th. East Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh are expected to receive heavy rains on the 16th and 17th, while Gangetic West Bengal is likely to experience rainfall on the 13th and 14th. Rain is also forecast for Jharkhand, Assam, and Meghalaya between the 14th and 15th of September. Additionally, Odisha is expected to receive heavy rains on the 13th and 14th, while Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, and Tripura may see rainfall on the 12th and 13th.Localised flooding is anticipated in urban areas of these regions, especially in low-lying areas, which may lead to road closures and traffic disruptions. Heavy rainfall could also result in occasional reductions in visibility, affecting travel. Minor damage to kutcha roads and vulnerable structures is expected, particularly in areas of heavy rainfall, while landslides and mudslides are possible in hilly regions. There is also a risk of riverine flooding in certain river catchments; for further details, the Central Water Commission (CWC) website provides more information.Rainfall and flood risks in South India: Isolated heavy to very heavy rainfall is expected during this period in coastal and south interior Karnataka, as well as the Ghat areas of Tamil Nadu.Localised flash floods and waterlogging are anticipated in urban areas, leading to road closures and increased travel times due to traffic delays. Minor damage to kutcha roads and vulnerable structures is likely, along with possible landslides or mudslides in hilly regions. The heavy rainfall could also affect standing crops and horticulture in certain areas due to inundation. As in Week 1, certain river catchments may be at risk of flooding, and detailed information can be obtained from the CWC website.","A depression that formed over central India is predicted to cause heavy to extremely heavy rainfall in Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, and nearby regions.

Heated debate between BJP & opposition at JPC meet on waqf bill, officials asked tough questions

At a parliamentary panel meeting, top government officials faced intense questioning over the Waqf Amendment Bill. Opposition members argued that ministries were not independently assessing the draft legislation but following official directives. The bill aims to remove encroachments on government lands and expedite development projects, sparking heated debates between BJP and opposition lawmakers.

Hyderabad: A delegation of the Telangana Waqf Board has submitted a memorandum to the Joint Parliamentary Committee (renamed as Joint Working Committee) on the proposed Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024, in New Delhi and rejected the Bill, pointing out 41 proposed amendments in it as “detrimental to Muslims and aimed at usurping waqf properties”.The delegation was led by Telangana Waqf Board chairman Syed Azmatullah Husseni, with AIMIM president and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi, four-term board member and former central waqf council member Syed Akbar Nizamuddin, Telangana Urdu Academy and Minorities Finance Corporation chairpersons Taher Bin Hamdan and Obedulla Kothwal respectively, and the board’s chief executive officer Mohammed Asadullah, among others, giving their opinion on the amendments proposed in the proposed bill.It was on August 26 that a special meeting of the Telangana Waqf Board unanimously resolved to reject the Centre’s Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024, thereby becoming the first such board in the country to formally oppose the proposed amendments to the Waqf Act.Sources told TOI that the delegation members, including Azmatullah Husseni, Akbar Nizamuddin, and Owaisi, pointed out 41 proposed amendments point by point and explained how damaging they were to the Muslims and waqf properties. For example, they said while the Centre proposes to remove the provision of non-Muslims donating their properties to waqf, it at the same time wants two non-Muslim members on the waqf boards in every state.The JWC, which called for the hearing on Friday, laid down the condition that the details of the meeting should not be divulged anywhere else.","Muslim community leaders met NCP MP Suresh Mhatre to voice their opposition to the Waqf Amendment Bill, 2024.

I do not have any political party connections. Sorry, if I have said anything wrong.”Srinivasan, who is also the president of the Tamil Nadu hotel owners’ association, in a lighthearted comment raised concern about the varying GST rates on food items while addressing Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman during an event in Coimbatore.""Madam, a bun doesn't attract GST, but when cream is applied to make it a cream bun, it attracts 12 per cent GST. Customers now say, 'You bring the bun and cream separately, and I'll make the cream bun,'"" said Srinivasan.

India set to ink $4 billion deal for 31 Predator drones with US in October,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-set-to-ink-4-billion-deal-for-31-predator-drones-with-us-in-oct/articleshow/113359442.cms,"NEW DELHI: India is getting set to ink the mega deal for 31 weaponised MQ-9B `hunter-killer’ Predator drones with the US next month, with the defence ministry now finalizing the `draft note’ for the finance ministry and then the final nod from the PM-led cabinet committee on security.The report of the MoD’s contract negotiation committee has been “submitted and accepted” for the government-to-government deal for which the US had earlier quoted a price of $3.9 billion (over Rs 33,500 crore), sources told TOI.The development comes as PM Modi is slated to visit the US for the fourth in-person Quad leaders’ summit to be hosted by President Joe Biden in Wilmington, Delaware, on September 21.“The contract should be inked in mid-Oct. The costing, setting up of a MRO (maintenance, repair, overhaul) facility here, performance-based logistics support and other such issues have been finalized after hard negotiations,” a source said.While there will be no direct transfer of technology (ToT) in the deal, the 31 remotely-piloted aircraft will be assembled here, with the drone-manufacturer General Atomics making an investment in India and sourcing over 30 per cent of the components from Indian companies.Drone-manufacturer General Atomics will also provide expertise and consultancy to DRDO and others to develop such high-altitude, long endurance drones indigenously.TOI was the first to report last month that India was fast-tracking the techno-commercial negotiations for the deal, under which 15 Sea Guardian drones are earmarked for Navy and 8 Sky Guardians each for Army and IAF, in the backdrop of both China and Pakistan steadily boosting their fleets of armed UAVs.Designed to fly for almost 40 hours at altitudes over 40,000-feet, the 31 MQ-9B drones will come with 170 Hellfire missiles, 310 GBU-39B precision-guided glide bombs, navigation systems, sensor suites and mobile ground control systems, among other associated equipment. India will also equip the drones with indigenous weapons, including the naval short-range anti-ship missiles (NASM-SR) being developed by DRDO, in the future.Apart from long-range strategic ISR (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance) missions and over-the-horizon targeting, the drones can undertake anti-warship and anti-submarine warfare operations.This becomes crucial in the backdrop of the Chinese Navy’s increasing footprint in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), with its submarines capable of posing a major strategic challenge to India in the maritime domain after the land borders.“China has been systematically deploying its survey and research vessels in the IOR to map oceanographic and other data useful for underwater domain awareness and submarine operations. Chinese nuclear-powered submarines, which as of now come to the IOR occasionally, will be on regular deployments to the region in the near future,” an officer said.India, hoping to get the initial deliveries of the fighter-sized drones in two to three years, plans to deploy them at ISR command and control centres at Arakkonam and Porbandar for the IOR and Sarsawa and Gorakhpur for the land borders.","The report of the MoD’s contract negotiation committee has been “submitted and accepted” for the government-to-government deal for which the US had earlier quoted a price of $3.9 billion.

Khera also alleged that between 2021 and 2024, Puri Buch invested in four overseas exchange-traded funds (ETF) - which are like mutual funds and can be traded on exchanges - including in Global X MSCI China Consumer (CHIQ) and Invesco China Technologies ETF.Neither Sebi nor Puri Buch commented on the fresh accusations. While CHIQ seeks to invest in large-and mid-capital segments of the MSCI China Index classified in the Consumer Discretionary Sector, the second fund is based on the FTSE China Incl A 25% Technology Capped Index, according to information available on websites.On Friday, the Sebi chief and her husband, Dhaval, had dismissed the earlier charges as ""false, incorrect, malicious and motivated"" and said that all disclosures had been made.As a top regulatory official, Puri Buch and her family members are allowed to hold shares and units of mutual funds under Sebi's code of conduct but disclosures are required. Besides, the code does not put any restriction on investment in instruments regulated overseas.Khera sought to invoke the China factor given the restrictions placed by govt on investments with the neighbour following border tension. ""It is deeply concerning to learn that Ms Madhabi P Buch, the Sebi chairperson, has been investing in Chinese funds. When the Prime Minister of India can publicly give China a clean chit, it's hardly surprising that a key regulatory figure is engaging in investments linked to China,"" the Congress spokesperson said. He also questioned the overseas assets and sought to know when they were disclosed.While the Sebi boss and her husband had disclosed on Friday that the former Unilever executive's consulting income was routed via two consulting firms - Agora Partners (Singapore entity) and Agora Advisory (Indian entity), Khera raised questions about Puri Buch's association with the overseas outfit. ""Is it true that Ms Madhabi P Buch was actively involved in Agora Partners PTE (Singapore) as she was a signatory to the bank account?"" he questioned.Khera asked Puri Buch if she or her company has dealt with companies that figured in Panama Papers and Paradise Papers - a reference to exposes on tax evasion and laundering. ""If she does not respond to our questions, then we will give the answers,"" he said.He said Congress will give a detailed reply to the clarifications given by Puri Buch and her husband, which he dubbed as vague.Asked if the party was contemplating legal action, Khera said Congress is waiting for action by the PM and finance minister, while a Trinamool Congress MP has already approached the Lokpal.About Puri Buch's threat to initiate legal action against entities which have illegally obtained her and her husband's income tax returns to cull the information about investments, Khera said Congress has nothing to do with the returns and that it is only discharging its duty as a responsible opposition party of bringing to light questionable details about impropriety that are not known to people.","Sebi chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch was trading in "" listed securities "" during her tenure at the agency.

Study has shown nearly 50% of lung cancer patients across the country are non-smokers. Experts say pollution plays a big role in people falling prey to cancer. TOI analyses the effects of pollution on healthThere was a time when smoking would be associated with lung cancer and whenever we would see our loved ones light up cigarettes, we would immediately urge them to give up the harmful habit, fearing that they may be affected with the terminal disease.Even cigarette packets carry a ‘smoking kills’ sign in a perhaps feeble attempt to dissuade people from smoking and possibly protect them from the disease. But does not consuming tobacco shield you from lung cancer? Not anymore as per studies that show 40-50% of lung cancer patients in India are non-smokers.The World Health Organisation (WHO) has added second-hand smoke and air pollution as risk factors for lung cancer, along with consuming tobacco. Air pollution, especially particulate matter (PM2.5), is believed to be a risk factor for lung cancer in non-smokers. It has become a major concern in urban areas, as per a recent study published in The Lancet.The study stated that exposure to asbestos, chromium, cadmium, arsenic and coal products at the workplace can be a potential cause of lung cancer. “Factors like genetic susceptibility, hormonal status and pre-existing lung diseases have also been implicated in the rising incidence of lung cancer in non-smokers,” read the study’s analysis conceived and designed by Dr Vanita Noronha and Dr Kumar Prabhash of Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai.Dr Tarini P Sahoo, a native of Odisha who works in a Bhopal-based hospital and is among the 36 authors of the study, said, “Lung cancer cases are increasing among non-smokers, perhaps due to passive smoking. Pollution will lead to chronic lung diseases and some studies have proven that lung cancers are more common in patients with pre-existing lung diseases.”Dr Sourav Mishra, associate professor of medical oncology department at AIIMS Bhubaneswar, said, “We have conducted a survey of 100 lung cancer patients and of them, over 30% were non-smokers.”He added, “Pollution is an unknown killer. There is data about the harmful effects of smoking cigarettes, cigars and other tobacco-based products and the contents the smokers inhale through them, but more extensive studies are required to know about the pollutants people inhale daily. We need to know if it directly causes lung cancer and if so, to what extent.”The rate of lung cancer - the symptoms of which include persistent cough, chest pain and shortness of breath - in the country has increased from 6.62 per one lakh population in 1990 to 7.7 per one lakh population in 2019.Cases in metropolitan cities are expected to rise significantly by 2025, as per the study published in The Lancet. The study says that in India, lung cancer tends to manifest around 10 years sooner than in Western nations, with a mean age of diagnosis being between 54 and 70 years. Studies have shown that over two-thirds of the lung cancer patients in India are men, and 42.4% men and 14.2% women consume tobacco.“Three of every 10 adults who work indoors have been exposed to second-hand smoke at the workplace,” read the report.Traditionally, lung cancer was more common in older adults, usually diagnosed in those over 65.However, there has been an increase in cases among younger individuals, some even in their 30s and 40s.This could be due to earlier detection, genetic factors, or environmental exposures, said earlier studies.“We need to conduct a detailed study regarding the relation between pollution and lung cancer,” Bhubaneswar-based pulmonologist Dr Sourav Mishra said.He added, “There is a higher detection rate of specific genetic mutations, such as EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) mutations and ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) rearrangements, particularly in non-smokers and young patients. Our cells in the body grow in a regulated way, but the EGFRs are getting dis-regulated and function in an autonomous way. Targeted therapy is being used to treat lung cancer patients with these mutated genes. EGFR mutation is around 30-40% in Southeast Asia and in the Indian population.”Dr Sarat Kumar Behera, a city-based pulmonary medicine specialist, said there are a lot of causes behind lung cancer and pollution could be a likely cause of it. “Pollution causes respiratory disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and other related ailments. The pre-existing diseases in lungs may cause lung cancer in future,” he added.“There is no doubt that smoking is a major risk factor for lung cancer, but so is pollution nowadays,” Dr Deepak Rautray, director of Acharya Harihar PG Institute of Cancer, Cuttack, said, while advocating for early diagnosis for timely treatment of the disease.“The cornerstone of cancer cure and treatment is early detection. If you miss that bus, then you are fighting a lost battle. The chances of cure and survival increases with early detection,” he added.Gouranga Mohapatra, a health activist in Bhubaneswar, said the govt should start lung cancer screening of citizens for early detection.--According to the Indian Council of Medical Research-National Cancer Registry Programme (ICMR-NCRP), cancer cases are on the rise in Odisha.--In 2020, the state had reported 50,692 cancer cases, while it had reported 51,829 in 2021. This number was 52,960 in 2022 and 54,856 last year.--In Odisha, mortality in cancer cases was 28,024 in 2020, as many as 28,656 in 2021, a total of 29,287 in 2022 and 30,147 last year.--In national level, the country had reported 13.92 lakh cases in 2020, more than 14.26 lakh in 2021 and over 14.61 lakh in 2022 and 14.97 lakh last year.--In India, mortality in cancer cases was 7.7 lakh in 2020, over 7.89 lakh in 2021 and 8.08 lakh in 2022 and around 9 lakh last year.(Collected mostly from govt hospitals)","Study has shown nearly 50% of lung cancer patients across the country are non- smokers.

Is there anything unusual that you see in lung cancer cases nowadays?

What is the status of lung cancer patients in AIIMS Bhubaneswar?

What steps can be taken to reduce the disease burden?

Dr Prasanta Raghab Mohapatra, dean (academic), professor of pulmonary medicine and critical care at AIIMS Bhubaneswar , speaks to TOI about the risk factors of lung cancerThe link between pollution and lung cancer is well-established, particularly concerning outdoor air pollution and exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and other harmful pollutants.Fine particulate matter (PM2.5), tiny particles that are less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, can penetrate deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream, and long-term exposure to high levels of PM2.5 is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer. PM2.5 is primarily produced by vehicle emissions, industrial processes, power plants and residential heating. Even prolonged exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a gas produced by burning fuel, has been linked to an increased risk of lung cancer since it contributes to respiratory inflammation and can aggravate pre-existing lung conditions. Others include ground-level ozone, industrial emissions like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are known carcinogens, chemical pollutants, indoor air pollution, particularly from burning biomass fuels. Individuals working in sectors like mining, construction and manufacturing that have a high exposure to dust, fumes and chemicals are at an increased risk of lung cancer due to prolonged exposure to air-borne pollutants.Air pollution causes chronic inflammation and oxidative stress in the lungs, leading to cellular damage, mutations and may cause cancer. Pollutants can directly damage DNA in lung cells, leading to mutations that trigger the uncontrolled growth of cancerous cells. Numerous studies have demonstrated a clear association between exposure to air pollution and increased lung cancer risk. WHO and the International Agency for Research on Cancer have classified outdoor air pollution and particulate matter as carcinogenic to humans.In recent years, there have been some unusual and emerging trends in lung cancer cases that differ from the traditional patterns typically associated with the disease. A growing proportion of lung cancer cases are being diagnosed in people who have never smoked. This trend is partly attributed to factors like air pollution, radon exposure and genetic predisposition. More and more younger patients are suffering from the disease which wasn’t the case several decades ago. While men traditionally had higher rates of lung cancer due to higher smoking rates, there has been a relative increase in lung cancer incidence among women, particularly non-smokers .Over 2,000 cases were diagnosed in Bhubaneswar. Over the past decade, the numbers are increasing.Reducing the disease burden of lung cancer requires a multifaceted approach involving early detection, effective treatment and supportive care. Implementing and promoting smoking cessation programs, including nicotine replacement therapy and medications, can help reduce the risk of lung cancer. Increasing taxes on tobacco products and enforcing strict regulations on advertising can help reduce tobacco use. We need to reduce exposure to air pollution by enforcing air quality standards and reducing emissions from vehicles and industrial sources.","Dr Prasanta Raghab Mohapatra, dean (academic), professor of pulmonary medicine and critical care at AIIMS Bhubaneswar speaks to TOI about the risk factors of lung cancer. Pollutants can directly damage DNA in lung cells, leading to mutations that trigger the uncontrolled growth of cancerous cells.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113355685,imgsize-1116851,width-400,resizemode-4/113355685.jpg"

Transport minister

Mauvin Godinho

is struggling to update Goa’s transport system. In a chat with Team TOI, he says it is not just ever-evolving technology that he must cope with but also Goan cabbies’ resistance to change. Edited excerpts from Townhall With

TOI

Govt doesn’t seem to have a comprehensive mobility plan, or if there is, we are not aware of it. How do you plan to tackle the issues in the public transport sector?

Lack of Public Transport has been a Bane for Goa

Is there a solution to the taxi issue in sight?

Goa's Taxi operators are Exploitative

How will the introduction of EVs help the current transport system?

Once the registered vehicle scrapping facility is operational in Oct, will you consider scrapping even private vehicles over 15 years?

The skybus project failed in Goa.

Lack of Public Transport has been a Bane for Goa

But isn’t that also true for some from your own party who have vote banks of taxi drivers and try to instigate them?

What about the future of ride-sharing apps like Ola and Uber in Goa?

What is your vision for KTC beyond the focus on electric vehicles?

How does govt plan to update traffic signals with high-tech systems?

I agree that the transportation system in Goa is not at its best. There are problems, and while we’ve made some improvements, there is still work to be done.Currently, there is no affordable transport, and this has been the bane of Goa.Historically, we faced similar problems with buses, which led to the creation of the Kadamba Transport Corporation (KTC). Now, with the introduction of electric vehicles, we’re experiencing a shortage due to financial constraints and issues with suppliers. For example, Olectra Greentech Ltd., which was supposed to supply e-buses to Goa, did not meet its commitments. However, thanks to our proactive approach, the IIT alumni council has come forward with a fund of around Rs 2,500 crore for social impact projects, including transportation. They are providing Goa with around 500 buses, costing nearly Rs 700 crore, for free.The biggest problem with Goa’s transport is taxis. I want to build bridges with the taxi operators by urging them to recognise the changing times and adapt to new trends.Unfortunately, some taxi operators seem resistant to change and adopt new technology. As the late Prime Minister Pt Jawaharlal Nehru once said, “Goa ke log ajeeb hai,” I’d say, “Goa ke taxi wale bohot ajeeb hai,” because their reluctance to adapt is perplexing.The taxi operators held a grudge because we made them install taxi meters, but if taxi operators adopt any app-based system, there will be no need for traditional meters. I would be willing to scrap them entirely.GoaMiles generates valuable data for planning, including information on tourist arrivals and financial metrics like TDS and GST contributions, which amount to aroundRs 10 crore annually. We are currently losing approximately Rs 100 crore annually due to unpaid TDS and GST, as many taxi operators do not contribute to govt revenue.The opposition to app-based taxis from some operators seems to be an attempt to return to outdated practices where passengers are charged exorbitantly, such as Rs 1,800-2,000 for a trip that should cost Rs 500. This attitude denies people the choice of affordable and convenient travel options.Taxi operators are saying GoaMiles is destroying the business of Goans, but 60% of its users and 95% of its drivers are Goans.Today, we’re in a competitive world, not just competing with fellow Goans but with the national and global market. The good old’sussegad’ days are gone.The new buses will address the need for night buses, ladies’ buses, and hinterland connectivity. We will ensure that women have safe and harassment-free travel options. The introduction of more buses will also help cover routes to industrial areas and hinterland destinations. We want to expand our digital footprint by implementing an intelligent transport management system (ITMS), which is currently in development. We are also upgrading our bus stands through public-private partnerships.There are some private bus and car owners who contend that their older vehicles, which are still in good condition, should not be scrapped. To address this, we are developing a system to incentivise the scrapping of old vehicles. This includes increasing the subsidy for replacing old buses from the previous amount of Rs 3 lakh to 10 lakh. It is going to be my best endeavour to convince the finance department to allocate funds, as securing this money is challenging. While extending this to private car owners is complex due to the presence of vintage and classic cars, we are carefully considering how to address these concerns.Is there anything else on the table for a metro rail connecting Pernem to Canacona?nThere have been some proposals that have come to us, but they have not been actively at the table. There is a concern that if a metro or mass transportation system is introduced, it would be seen as a threat to the taxi operators, who might argue that such developments would harm their business. Everybody will say, “You’re killing us” or “Goemkaarak kabar korta”. There is also political fallout to consider. Unfortunately, politics can sometimes prioritise short-term gains or vote banks over long-term benefits for the community.nBy saying that you are touching a raw nerve. This is bound to happen at some point or another because some people keep themselves and their self-interest before anything else.There was a proposal to replace autorickshaws with electric rickshaws. However, this idea was met with resistance because some auto drivers were concerned that the EVs would be incorporated into the app-based systems. Personally, I am open to the idea of integrating services like Ola and Uber. For a state like Goa, which is a major tourist destination, having these services is essential.To be honest, I’ve devoted more time to the industrial sector, including our IDC, and we’re preparing to launch a new, transparent digital portal for it. However, with regards to KTC, we’re looking at using AI to optimise bus routes and operations to maximise revenue and efficiency.We’re also installing cameras across Goa and upgrading traffic signals to enhance road discipline and safety. Additionally, I’m reviewing high-security number plates, digital taxi meters, and speed governors to determine what needs to be retained, scrapped, or revised.We’re aiming to hire a reputable agency with strong expertise in AI and traffic signalling to ensure we get a top-notch system for Goa. We want to avoid selecting a vendor simply because they’re offering a business deal. Our goal is to implement a high-quality system that truly benefits the state. Having a single, well-managed control room—for North and South Goa each—will reduce confusion and improve traffic management.","Mauvin Godinho is struggling to update Goa’s transport system.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

20 bodyguards for 'voyager': Inside Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s $6-figure security detail,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/20-bodyguards-for-voyager-inside-tesla-ceo-elon-musks-6-figure-security-detail/articleshow/113353777.cms,"Tesla's headquarters in Austin, Texas, has ramped up security measures following a series of disturbing threats targeting CEO Elon Musk and other high-ranking executives. According to Business Insider, the company has made over five emergency 911 calls linked to ""terroristic threats"" between April 2022 and January 2024, prompting Tesla to spend millions to ensure the safety of its personnel and facilities.One of the most serious incidents occurred in March 2023 when then-Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn received a death threat via email. The email demanded $300,000 in bitcoin to spare his life, although authorities later deemed the threat a scam. Kirkhorn stepped down from his position in August 2023, months after the threat. In January 2024, another 911 call was made after a Tesla employee used X, formerly Twitter, to threaten Musk and U.S. President Joe Biden. The employee was arrested, and the threat was classified as ""terroristic.""Musk, who is code-named ""Voyager"" by his security team, rarely goes anywhere without his extensive security detail . The New York Times reported that Musk is typically flanked by as many as 20 security personnel, some armed, and accompanied by a medical professional. His net worth, estimated at over $250 billion by Bloomberg, has placed him at greater risk, necessitating constant protection. His security costs reportedly run into six figures monthly, once reaching over $163,000 in a single month in 2016.As Musk’s wealth and status have grown, so too have the risks. At Tesla's shareholder meeting in June 2024, Musk revealed that ""two homicidal maniacs"" had tried to kill him in recent months, forcing him to become more cautious. ""I probably need to, like, not get assassinated or something,"" Musk said.Musk has also taken personal measures to protect himself, including buying a house with 24/7 security after his address became public. Tesla's SEC filings show that Musk’s security company billed the company $2.4 million in 2023 and another $500,000 by February 2024.Tesla’s increased security also extends beyond Musk. The company has bolstered surveillance and personnel at its factories following recent layoffs, and factory workers in both Nevada and Texas now undergo multiple security checks each day to enter the facilities.","Tesla has made over five emergency 911 calls linked to ""terroristic threats"" between April 2022 and January 2024.
