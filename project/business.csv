Jimmy Carter's India connection: Haryana village was named 'Carterpuri' in his honour,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jimmy-carters-india-connection-haryana-village-was-named-carterpuri-in-his-honor/articleshow/116782324.cms,"The 39th President of the United States, Jimmy Carter , who passed away at the age of 100, shared a unique connection with India—one that extended beyond diplomacy. Known as ' Carterpuri ,' a small village in Haryana was renamed in his honor following his historic visit to India in 1978.Carter was the first American leader to visit India after the Emergency era and the victory of the Janata Party in 1977. His address to the Indian Parliament on January 2, 1978, championed democracy and freedom, rejecting authoritarianism.“India’s successes decisively refute the theory that a developing country must accept authoritarian or totalitarian rule to achieve economic and social progress,” Carter had said.He praised India’s electoral democracy, saying, “The largest electorate on earth freely and wisely chose its leaders at the polls. Democracy itself was the victor.”The following day, Carter and then-Prime Minister Morarji Desai signed the Delhi Declaration , solidifying ties between the two nations. Speaking at Rashtrapati Bhawan, Carter highlighted the shared values of democracy and human rights, noting that India and the US exemplified governance rooted in serving the citizen, not the other way around.Carter’s connection to India deepened during a visit to the village of Daulatpur Nasirabad, near Delhi. Accompanied by his wife, Rosalynn, he was welcomed warmly by villagers who later renamed their home ""Carterpuri."" The bond between Carter and the village endured, with residents celebrating his Nobel Peace Prize win in 2002 and commemorating January 3 as a local holiday.This visit was significant beyond its symbolism. Carter’s mother, Lillian Carter, had worked in India as a Peace Corps volunteer in the 1960s, making his ties to the country deeply personal. The Carter Centre later remarked that the visit laid the groundwork for a lasting partnership between India and the US, rooted in mutual respect and shared ideals.Carter’s presidency (1977–1981) coincided with Cold War tensions, volatile oil markets, and domestic struggles over civil rights and gender equality. His most notable achievement was brokering the 1978 Camp David Accords , a peace agreement between Egypt and Israel. Despite challenges like the Iranian hostage crisis and economic turmoil, Carter’s post-presidential legacy flourished through humanitarian efforts, earning him the Nobel Peace Prize.","Carter was the first American leader to visit India after the Emergency era and the victory of the Janata Party in 1977.

Contemplating terrorist act for years is also an act of terrorism: Delhi HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/contemplating-terrorist-act-for-years-is-also-an-act-of-terrorism-delhi-hc/articleshow/116780669.cms,"HC: Bids to brainwash youth, recruit them can't be ignored



NEW DELHI: Contemplating a terrorist act for years, even without executing it, constitutes a terrorist act, the Delhi high court has said.""The definition of 'terrorist act' under Section 15 of UAPA clearly includes the expressions 'with intent to strike terror', by any other means of whatever nature to cause or likely to cause. Such an expression would not be linked only to an immediate terrorist act but would even include acts, which could be under contemplation for years together and may be given effect to after several years,"" the court said in its Dec 23 order.A division bench was hearing an appeal against the conviction of a member of Al-Qaida in Indian Subcontinent ( AQIS ) under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.The prosecution alleged that the AQIS member was responsible for sending people to Pakistan for arms training. During his visit to Pakistan, the appellant met the chief of Lashkar-e-Taiba and chief of Jamaat-ud-Dawah, who is wanted for involvement in the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, the prosecution alleged. In 2015, the appellant visited Bengaluru and met a co-convict, and they discussed the planning and objectives of AQIS. The appellant also gave inflammatory speeches against the nation and propagated 'jihad' in his speeches, the prosecution said.The witnesses stated before the court that he delivered provocative speeches to the effect that RSS, BJP, and VHP conspired against Muslims and that Muslims should also unite.The division bench of Justices Prathiba M Singh and Amit Sharma observed that Section 18 of UAPA punishes preparation for terrorist acts, even when a specific terrorist act has not been identified. ""The planning to give effect to terrorist acts could also extend over years and under Section 18 of UAPA, the law aims to address such preparation for terrorist acts, even in cases where a specific terrorist act has not been identified,"" it said.The bench added, ""Moreover, speeches which are given to brainwash innocent youth, coupled with attempts to recruit them for committing unlawful and illegal acts against the country, cannot be completely washed away on the ground that no specific terrorist act has been committed.""The court noted that there was sufficient evidence to show and link the appellant with the main accused who obtained passports and visited Pakistan, stating that the appellant, along with co-accused, is part of a larger network involved in giving inflammatory speeches, disseminating material, having links with Pakistan-based organisations, recruiting persons for terrorist acts, and instigating hatred against India and its political leaders.The court further remarked that a terrorist act includes indulging in conspiracy with terrorist organisations and associated persons. ""A perusal of the definition of 'terrorist act' under UAPA shows that...(it) includes any acts which intend to threaten or are likely to threaten the unity, integrity, security, or sovereignty of India. The definition is wide enough to include indulging in conspiracy with terrorist organisations and associated with persons who are rendering support to terrorist organisations,"" said high court.Stating that for conspiracy, specific covert acts are not necessary, even secretive and clandestine support to declared terrorist organisations would also suffice, the court noted that the evidence and the testimonies clearly disclosed the appellant's association with terrorist organisations for the commission of conspiracy to commit a terrorist act.","Delhi high court: Contemplating a terrorist act for years, even without executing it, constitutes a terrorist acts.

"2,000 dead, $288 billion lost to top 10 climate disasters in 2024: Report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2000-dead-288bn-lost-to-top-10-climate-disasters-in-24-report/articleshow/116779646.cms,"NEW DELHI: Top 10 climate disasters cost the world more than $288 billion and took over 2,000 lives in 2024 with the US alone taking the biggest hit of nearly 50% of the cost whereas five countries in south-east Asia, put together, facing over 40% of the total casualties.A new report - Counting the cost 2024: a year of climate breakdown - compiling the economic impact and human casualties of big disasters across the globe shows though no part of the world was spared from such crippling events this year, North America (4) and Europe (3) reported seven of the 10 costliest disasters. Remaining three were reported from China, Brazil and south-east Asian countries.“Most of these estimates are based only on insured losses, meaning the true financial costs are likely to be even higher, while the human costs are often uncounted,” said the report, released by the Christian Aid, a global NGO, on Monday.It also noted that the impacts and costs of climate events fall disproportionately on those living in poverty in lower income countries. “This is because they will have fewer assets, less insurance and generally poorer access to comprehensive public services,” said the report.Since the estimates are mainly based on insured losses, the report doesn't include landslides in Wayanad, Kerala in its list of costliest disasters despite the events, linked to extremely heavy rainfall, witnessed killing of over 200 people in July.In terms of events which caused the biggest financial cost in 2024, the US bore the brunt with Hurricane Milton in October topping the list as the single biggest one-off event at $60 billion in damage and killing 25 people. Hurricane Helene which struck the US, Cuba and Mexico in September was next at $55 billion and killed 232 people.“In fact, the US was hit by so many costly storms throughout the year that even when hurricanes were removed, the other convective storms cost more than $60 billion in damage and killed 88 people,” the report said.In terms of human casualties, Typhoon Yagi battered south-east Asia, killing more than 800 people in September. The Typhoon made landfall on September 2 in the Philippines, before moving on to Laos, Myanmar, Vietnam and Thailand, where it triggered landslides, flash flooding and damaged hundreds of thousands of homes and agricultural land worth $12.6 billion. Floods in China, costing $15.6 billion, killed 315 people during June-July.On the other hand, European countries accounted for three of the top 10 costliest disasters with Storm Boris in central Europe and floods in Spain and Germany costing a combined $13.87 billion, and killing 258 people, 226 of which were in Valencia’s floods in October. In Brazil, floods in the state of Rio Grande do Sul killed 183 people and caused $5 billion in damage.“These terrible climate disasters are a warning sign of what is to come if we do not accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels. They also show the urgent need for adaptation measures, especially in the global South, where resources are especially stretched, and people are most vulnerable to extreme weather events,” said Patrick Watt, Christian Aid CEO.","North America (4) and Europe (3) reported seven of the 10 costliest disasters.

Smart cities staring at financial crisis: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/smart-cities-staring-at-financial-crisis-study/articleshow/116779043.cms,"NEW DELHI: A study by IIT-Kharagpur has flagged how Integrated Command and Control Centres (ICCCs), which are the nerve centres of 100 smart cities , are staring at a financial sustainability crisis as states and municipalities are not allocating them enough funds.ICCCs are integrated and centralised control-cum-monitoring centres for different services and systems of a city. The key features integrated under these centres are city infrastructure management, civic services monitoring, traffic and transportation management, safety and surveillance, and disaster risk simulation and prediction.In its study on ICCCs' role on effective disaster management , the premier technical institute concluded that the financial sustainability of these centres remain the ""biggest challenge"" to be addressed by the Smart City Mission. It has strongly recommended a mechanism for revenue sharing, which is generated from the core functions of an ICCC such as traffic management and surveillance.""At present, the revenue generated goes to the state exchequer with no basis for sharing with ICCCs which have to install, maintain, operate and periodically upgrade infrastructure. There are huge recurring costs required for the operation and maintenance of such infrastructure. A mechanism for cost sharing is mandatory for supporting the allied functions of the ICCC,"" the report said. It has recommended monetisation of ICCC infrastructure like optical fibre cable, and making a mobile application mandatory for ICCC and monetisation of such an application to bridge the cash crunch faced by these facilities.""Mobile application and call centres should be made mandatory for all ICCCs apart from web-based services. This becomes the direct point of contact for citizens with urban local bodies (ULBs) and Smart City Mission via ICCC for availing varied urban services or lodging complaints related to the same,"" the report said.Taking note of high dependence on private players in managing ICCCs, the study has recommended that there is a need to focus on in-house capacity building of staff and lesser reliance on the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). It has said OEMs must be supervised and managed by managerial staff either from the Smart City Mission unit or ULBs.This study has lauded the role of ICCCs in disaster management in Bhubaneswar, Visakhapatnam and Agartala. It noted the role of these centres and smart city infrastructure in disease control and management particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic.It has recommended the need to protect hardware deployed on the field for real-time information, which are prone to vandalism and theft.","ICCCs are integrated and centralised control-cum-monitoring centres for different services and systems of a city.

We have faith that the Shivling is there. We should all prepare for its excavation. The media should go first we will join after that,"" said Yadav during a press conference at the party office in Lucknow, drawing a round of laughter.The SP chief's comment came on Sunday as it marked the ninth day of excavation work underway in Sambhal district of Uttar Pradesh.During the press conference, Akhilesh Yadav said that the current government has brought deterioration rather than progress. The former chief minister highlighted that under BJP's governance, Uttar Pradesh is number one in borrowing and debt.He further said that the treasury has been emptied.He also criticised the government and accused it of cheating the farmers. ""Has the income of farmers doubled?"" he asked.Yadav added ""houses of innocent people are being demolished illegally by bulldozers"".""This is not development but destruction. There is no line of development in the hands of the chief minister, there is a line of destruction ('mukhyamantree jee ke haath mein vikaas kee rekha nahin hai, vinaash kee rekha hai'),"" he said, according to a statement issued by the Samajwadi Party.The SP leader asserted that the BJP administration has failed to implement any developmental initiatives. He pointed out that prices, joblessness and dishonest practices have reached unprecedented levels, causing widespread discontent among farmers and youth.Earlier on Saturday, an official of the Chandausi municipality in Sambhal district said that nearby encroachments would be cleared to trace out an ancient stepwell . The stepwell was discovered after the reopening of a Shiv-Hanuman temple in the district, which had been closed for 46 years.""Till Friday, we kept on digging the stairs and the sides, but a well has been found on the road premises, exactly at the centre. It seems that the structure is all around this well,"" the official said.The official said that structures constructed nearby, which have encroached upon the structure, shall be cleared. He emphasised that as a protected historical monument, no individual has been given the right to encroach upon an archaeological relic or carry out construction activities over it.""After finding such a structure that has archaeological importance, it will be cleared from all sides. If the excavation is done using a tractor or JCB machine, it might get damaged. Therefore, by employing manual labour, the debris is being taken out using shovels and spades, which is why it is taking time. The Archaeological Survey of India is constantly studying the area and the excavation is being done under its guidance,"" he said.The Samajwadi Party is vocal against the excavation work underway in Sambhal district. The aggressiveness was also witnessed during the winter session of Parliament, where MPs of SP staged protests over the Sambhal violence .","The Samajwadi Party is vocal against the excavation work underway in Sambhal district.

Access to the public will begin four weeks later, in the second half of May, when airlines commence domestic flights, along with cargo operations. By the end of July, international flights will start, said Arun Bansal, CEO, Adani Airport Holdings Ltd on Sunday.Given that the Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA) is a greenfield airport - built on undeveloped land - and built in 2024-25, it will have ""all the modern amenities from day one like biometrics, connectivity between terminals,"" said Bansal.On Sunday, around 12.30pm, an IndiGo A320 aircraft took off from Mumbai airport and spent an hour circling over Karjat, Pen, carrying out technical assessment and missed approach manoeuvres as part of the ""validation flight"" process.At 1.32pm, the aircraft did a touchdown on runway 08-26, becoming the first airline jet to land at NMIA. The data collected from the validation flight will be submitted to the aviation regulator for grant of the mandatory aerodrome licence.On Oct 11, an Indian Air Force C-295, a large multi-role tactical airlifter, carried out an inaugural landing on the NMIA runway.The phase-1 terminal building has a capacity of 20 million passengers per annum (ppa). To put that in perspective, last fiscal, airports like Chennai and Kolkata handled about 20 million ppa. Mumbai airport handled 52.8 million ppa, while Delhi, the busiest airport in the country, handled 73.6 million ppa. ""Navi Mumbai airport will start with 10-12 million ppa, with 8-9 million domestic and about 2-3 million international passengers,"" said Bansal. By mid-2026, it will reach 20 million capacity. ""NMIA's terminal 2 will have 30 million ppa capacity and will go live by the end of 2028,"" Bansal said.When commissioned, the much-awaited NMIA will share the burden of the congested Mumbai airport, which is served by a single runway. ""About 15 million passengers from the Mumbai region are travelling to nearby states or other airports,"" Bansal said. ""Airlines are very keen to move to Navi Mumbai to capture that additional passenger growth from Mumbai,"" he said, adding that all domestic airlines are big enough, and so they won't move their entire operations to NMIA.""But certain international airlines with only a few flights per day might decide to have all their operations either out of Mumbai or Navi Mumbai,"" he added.Speaking about connectivity, Bansal said, ""We're very hopeful that the last-mile connectivity will continue to improve. There is a proposal for a new Metro line from Navi Mumbai to the existing Mumbai airport. A lot of highway connectivity has happened, and last mile connectivity will also be ready in time for commercial operations,"" he said.","The Navi Mumbai airport missed its much-touted March-end deadline, but not by much.

NEW DELHI: The sites being considered for former PM Manmohan Singh's memorial include the area near Kisan Ghat , the memorial of former PM Chaudhary Charan Singh, and Rashtriya Smriti Sthal which is the designated spot for the last rites of presidents, vice-presidents and PMs. Both sites are close to the Yamuna and a decision is expected in the next few days.On Saturday, BJP chief J P Nadda said govt has ""given the space for Singh's memorial and has also informed his family about it"". Though the location or land parcel has not been revealed, sources said details will be out soon. ""Usually, space for a memorial is allotted to a society for development and maintenance. The procedure will take some time,"" a govt source said.In an interview to a private TV channel, Union minister Hardeep Puri said Rashtriya Smriti Sthal, the final resting place of four ex-presidents and three former PMs, has space for two more. ""But the request from Congress suggested they wanted more, and that request was accepted,"" he said. This indicated that govt may be considering allocating a bigger space for the former PM's memorial.At present, there are 18 memorials in and around the Raj Ghat complex, which includes those of former presidents, PMs and deputy PMs. The two exceptions are Sanjay Gandhi and Lalita Shastri, late wife of former PM Lal Bahadur Shastri.Sources said going by the norms, Manmohan Singh's memorial could be built at Rashtriya Smriti Sthal, though allocation of space will be a political decision.The earmarked area near Ekta Sthal was developed as the designated spot for last rites and memorials of presidents, vice-presidents and PMs. This was done following concerns over shrinking land resources in the capital.Though govt had decided not to create more memorials in 2000, it took 13 years to earmark a single place for such personalities. Before that, separate memorials were created for national representatives including Raj Ghat, Shanti Van, Shakti Sthal, Veer Bhumi, Ekta Sthal, Samta Sthal and Kisan Ghat which occupied over 245 acres of prime land. Construction of Smriti Sthal was completed in 2015 and former PM P V Narasimha Rao was the first to get a 'samadhi' here, even though his family had to wait for 10 years.The Rs 40-crore project was designed for streamlining the maintenance of samadhis and cut down expenses.","The sites being considered for former PM Manmohan Singh's memorial include the area near Kisan Ghat.

ITANAGAR: Arunachal Pradesh CM Pema Khandu said the Siang Upper Multipurpose Project (SUMP), estimated to cost Rs 1.13 lakh crore, was being planned by the Centre not just for generating electricity but to maintain the natural flow of the river all year round and mitigate risks of flooding if China released excess water.Khandu's remarks came in the wake of China approving the construction of the world's largest dam, at a cost of $137 billion, on the Brahmaputra river in Tibet close to the Indian border.The dam is to be built at a gorge in the Himalayan reaches where the Brahmaputra makes a huge U-turn to flow into Arunachal and then to Bangladesh.""The SUMP, with an estimated installed capacity of 11,000 mw, is not just about generating power, but also about maintaining the natural flow of the Siang river and mitigating potential flood risks from water releases by China,"" Khandu said. ""The real objective of the project is to save the Siang river and the communities that have depended on it for generations,"" he said. The survey for preparing the pre-feasibility report of the projects is yet to be done amid opposition from locals concerned about displacement, loss of livelihoods, and environmental impact.Warning of severe consequences if China's project moves ahead ""without safeguards"", Khandu said plans to divert water from the Brahmaputra into its arid regions could drastically reduce the flow of the Siang river during winters.Acknowledging the ongoing bilateral discussions between India and China, the chief minister cautioned against ""complacency"" and underscored the need for India to remain vigilant.","The Siang Upper Multipurpose Project (SUMP), estimated to cost Rs 1.13 lakh crore, is being planned by the Centre.

Underwater Krishna-Godavari basin landslide can trigger tsunami: Scientists,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/underwater-krishna-godavari-basin-landslide-can-trigger-tsunami-scientists/articleshow/116774892.cms,"PANAJI: A recently discovered landslide in Krishna-Godavari basin, reaching between 950m and 1.1km below the ocean surface, could pose a serious risk to underwater structures, Goa-based National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) said. ""The huge landslide can displace a large amount of water and bottom sediments, potentially causing a tsunami,"" NIO director Sunil Kumar Singh told TOI.NIO scientists said the landslide in Bay of Bengal could have occurred anytime between 2009 and 2015. ""It poses a significant risk to underwater communication cables and oil rigs, as well as to people living on the coast,"" NIO said.The scientists believe that when the landslide occurred, it caused a massive section of the seabed to collapse, moving around 11 cubic km of sediments - enough to fill about 44 lakh Olympic-size swimming pools. At some places, the landslide deposits are up to 60m thick, NIO said. This giant underwater landslide , known as a mass transport deposit (MTD), has created a large fan-shaped deposit on the ocean floor, they said. The area the MTD covers is about 70sqkm - roughly the size of 10,000 football fields.The landslide was uncovered using special equipment that tracks changes in the ocean floor over time and was one of the largest underwater slope failures ever found in this part of the ocean, NIO said. The scientists believe several factors might have caused the landslide. One important factor could be Cyclone Helen, a category-1 storm that hit the region in Nov 2013.The cyclone's powerful winds and strong waves may have triggered the collapse. Other possible causes include extreme flooding events in 2010 and 2013, and a powerful 6 magnitude earthquake that shook Bay of Bengal in May 2014. They said even events like cyclones, heavy rain, and earthquakes that seem small on their own can trigger massive underwater landslides, especially if the ocean floor sediments are already weakened.Scientists are now urging more research and monitoring of areas like KG basin to better understand and predict underwater hazards.","A landslide in Krishna-Godavari basin could pose a serious risk to underwater structures.

Licence Raj

It was June 1991. Manmohan Singh had just returned to Delhi, after attending a conference in the Netherlands, and had gone to bed. Late that night, Singh's son-in-law, Vijay Tankha, took a phone call. The voice on the other end was that of PC Alexander, a confidante of PV Narasimha Rao . Alexander urged Vijay to wake up his father-in-law.Singh and Alexander met a few hours later, and the official told Singh about Rao's plan to appoint him FM. Singh, then UGC chairman, and who had never been in politics, didn't take Alexander seriously.But Rao was serious. On June 21, Singh was in his UGC office. He was told to go home, get dressed and attend the swearing-in function. ""Everybody was surprised to see me as a member of the new team lined up to take the oath of office. My portfolio was allotted later, but I was told straight away by Narasimha Rao ji that I was going to be finance minister,"" Singh is quoted as saying in 'Strictly Personal, Manmohan & Gursharan', a book by his daughter Daman Singh.That appointment changed the course of India's economy. From an insular, control-heavy, low-growth economy it became what's today the world's fastest growing major economy.Along with Rao, Singh was the architect of 1991 reforms, weathering attacks from inside and outside Congress. The economy was in tatters, forex reserves had dropped to Rs 2,500 crore, barely sufficient to cover 2 weeks of imports, global banks were refusing to offer loans, forex outflows were large, inflation was soaring.But Singh knew the problems beforehand, and also the solutions, which he outlined in his budget speech a month later. The ball was set rolling within days of moving into North Block. He worked closely with then RBI deputy governor C Rangarajan to devalue the rupee and removed export controls in partnership with P Chidambaram, then the commerce minister.July 24, the day Singh presented his first budget, saw the Indian economy saying good riddance to the licence-permit raj. Hours before the budget, the Rao govt tabled the new industrial policy in Parliament, working on a paper that Singh remembered having seen during his brief stint as economic adviser to Chandra Sekhar, who led a fragile coalition in 1990-91.Based on the document prepared by economic adviser Rakesh Mohan, industrial delicensing was undertaken in all but 18 sectors, and foreign direct investment was allowed in 34 industries. Besides, public sector monopoly in several sectors came to an end and disinvestment of govt shareholding in state-run companies was permitted.His budget freed up fund-raising by Indian companies by setting up Sebi and also announced a new committee under RBI governor M Narasimhan to work out the new architecture for the financial sector, which was implemented by the Rao govt and its successors. The budget focused on fiscal consolidation, by cutting down on wasteful spending.Singh had also drawn attention to the precarious price situation in his 1991 budget speech.""The price situation, which is of immediate concern to the vast mass of our people, poses a serious problem as inflation has reached a double digit level. During the fiscal year ending 31st March 1991 the wholesale price index registered an increase of 12.1%, while the consumer price index registered an increase of 13.6%. The major worrisome feature of the inflation in 1990-91 was that it was concentrated in essential commodities,"" Singh had said.Those reforms had put the economy back on track and triggered optimism globally. The ""Bombay Club"", a group of corporate chiefs who wanted protection from foreign competition, was not happy. But they got it wrong.","Manmohan Singh was the architect of 1991 reforms, weathering attacks from inside and outside Congress.

One flight attendant and one passenger have been rescued so far.According to Yonhap News Agency, the incident occurred at 9.03 am (1203 GMT) as Jeju Air Flight 2216, travelling from Bangkok to Muan, was attempting to land. The aircraft landing gear reportedly malfunctioned after the bird strike.The fire department informed Yonhap that emergency teams were conducting rescue operations from the aircraft's rear section and that the 15-year-old Boeing 737-800 jet was 'almost completely destroyed.'""The plane is almost completely destroyed, and identifying the deceased is proving difficult. The process is taking time as we locate and recover the remains,"" the fire department said in a statement.An image captured at the scene displayed the aircraft's tail section ablaze near the runway's edge, with emergency response vehicles and firefighting units positioned nearby.Meanwhile, Jeju Air CEO executive Kim E-bae, issued an apology and said they are determining the cause of the accident.""We express our deepest condolences and apologies to the families of the passengers who lost their lives in this accident.

Tech mogul Elon Musk described the philanthropic efforts of MacKenzie Scott, the ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, as ""concerning."" His comment came in response to a social media post scrutinising Scott’s extensive donations, alleging that her initiatives primarily fund non-profits promoting divisive ideologies rather than addressing pressing global issues.The post highlighted Scott’s “trust-based philanthropy ,” which involves providing no-strings-attached grants to over 2,500 non-profits. It alleged that her focus on causes such as racial equity, immigrant rights, and LGBTQ justice feeds what the post described as an “NGO/non-profit complex,” creating jobs for individuals seeking to validate their expensive degrees. The post further detailed Scott’s $16 billion in donations over five years, noting her wealth remains substantial at $36 billion, boosted by Amazon’s rising stock price.Scott, the ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has become one of the most prolific philanthropists in recent years. Through her “Yield Giving” initiative, she has pledged more than $19 billion since 2019 to causes ranging from girls’ education in Africa to affordable housing in the United States. Scott has championed a transformative approach to philanthropy, providing large, unrestricted grants that allow organisations to allocate funds as needed.In 2024 alone, Scott made repeat donations to several organisations, a rare move given her typical “one-time grant” approach. For example, CAMFED, which supports girls’ education in Africa, received its third donation this year. Another notable beneficiary, Enterprise Community Partners, was unexpectedly awarded an additional $65 million after initially receiving $50 million in 2020.This year also marked a significant shift in Scott’s giving strategy, with her introducing an open-call application process for the first time. Over 6,000 non-profits applied, and Scott committed $640 million to more than 360 organisations, far exceeding her initial promise. Grantees praised the unrestricted nature of her grants, describing them as transformative not only for individual organisations but also for entire sectors like affordable housing.","Elon Musk described the philanthropic efforts of MacKenzie Scott as ""concerning"" His comment came in response to a social media post scrutinising Scott’s extensive donations.

Green cards with diplomas: A shift in rhetoric?

Tech leaders weigh in

Defenders respond

A balancing act

Amid the ongoing debate over skilled immigration , Green Cards, and the H-1B visa program in the US, President-elect Donald Trump's proposal on immigration and labor policies is back into the spotlight, reigniting the contentious debates that dominated his first presidency. While Trump, known for his harsh stance on immigration, now faces both support and backlash for softening his approach toward foreign talent, the issue is far from resolved.During his 2024 campaign, Trump proposed that foreign students graduating from US colleges—especially from countries like India and China—should automatically receive Green Cards. His rationale was to prevent these students from leaving the US to start billion-dollar ventures abroad. ""If you graduate from a US college, you should automatically get a Green Card as part of your diploma,"" Trump said, calling it a missed opportunity for American growth.This marked a stark departure from Trump’s earlier policies, including his criticism of the H-1B visa program, which he had called a ""theft of American prosperity."" While the H-1B visa allows American companies to hire skilled foreign workers, Trump argued it exploited foreign labor at the expense of US citizens.Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, co-chairs of Trump’s new “Department of Government Efficiency,” have defended the tech industry’s reliance on foreign talent, citing a domestic shortage of skilled engineers. Musk, responding to criticism on his platform X, claimed the US lacks enough ""super talented and motivated"" engineers, while Ramaswamy blamed cultural factors for the gap in competitive US-born candidates.The debate intensified after Sriram Krishnan , Trump’s senior policy advisor on artificial intelligence, suggested lifting caps on Green Cards for skilled immigrants. Critics like far-right activist Laura Loomer accused Krishnan of undermining Trump’s “America First” agenda, claiming it prioritizes foreign STEM graduates over American workers.Conservative tech leaders defended Krishnan, emphasizing that his proposals focus on a merit-based Green Card system. David Sacks, tapped to serve as Trump’s AI and crypto czar, clarified that Krishnan supports a skills-driven program, not an unrestricted one. Joe Lonsdale, co-founder of Palantir, added that attracting the “best and brightest” is crucial for maintaining US global leadership, while rejecting lower-skilled immigration.As Trump prepares to implement his controversial immigration policies, including mass deportations, the push to attract top foreign talent underscores the tension between nationalist priorities and economic realities in the tech sector. Whether Trump can balance his “America First” agenda with the demands of Silicon Valley remains to be seen.","Trump proposed that foreign students graduating from US colleges should automatically receive Green Cards.

To this, X users corrected him and added that Elon Musk did not name the company Tesla as he joined the company in 2004, a year after the company was founded by Eberhard and Tarpenning in 2003.Some social media users even claimed that Nikola Tesla was middle class and his uncle was a high-ranking army member and can not be called ""penniless"".Elon Musk also shared a Grok (X's AI) note on Nikola Tesla's contribution.Born in a Serb family in the village of Smiljan, Nikola Tesla studied engineering and physics in the 1870s without receiving degree. Then he worked at Continental Efiroe and immigrated to the United States in 1884. Later on, he became naturalized American citizen.H-1B is the American visa that allows companies to hire foreign workers. As of now, every country has an equal cap on the number of H-1B visas. Donald Trump's pick for the AI advisor Sriram Krishnan said the cap should be removed to allow more foreign workers to come to the US. While Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy supported the idea, MAGA old-timers said this is against the America First policy. The controversy boiled down to an Elon Musk versus Laura Loomer fight on X in which Elon Musk said the GOP should get rid of these voices.Only Vivek Ramaswamy among these three technocrats were born in the US and thus a natural US citizen.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

"'Doesn't seem like suicide': Elon Musk wades into Suchir Balaji death controversy; 'support us', pleads techie's mother",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/doesnt-seem-like-suicide-elon-musk-wades-into-suchir-balaji-death-controversy-support-us-pleads-techies-mother/articleshow/116772626.cms,"Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has backed Poornima Ramarao’s claims of foul play in the mysterious death of her son, Suchir Balaji.Ramarao, the mother of a 26-year-old Indian-origin tech researcher and former OpenAI employee, has called for an FBI investigation, arguing that evidence uncovered through a private autopsy and investigation casts doubt on the police’s conclusion of suicide.Ramarao shared her concerns, writing, “Suchir’s apartment was ransacked, sign of struggle in the bathroom and looks like someone hit him in bathroom based on blood spots. It’s a cold-blooded mu*d*r declared by authorities as suicide. Lobbying in SF city doesn’t stop us from getting justices. We demand FBI investigation”In response, Musk voiced his support, tweeting, “This doesn’t seem like a suicide.”Following Musk’s comments, Ramarao reached out to him, asking for further assistance in the case.Earlier, the entrepreneur who co-founded OpenAI and later parted ways with the company had also posted about the incident, fueling further speculation surrounding Balaji’s sudden death.The tragedy has prompted prominent AI ethics advocates and creators to demand a full and transparent investigation, alongside stronger protections for individuals who raise ethical concerns within the tech industry.Balaji, a respected figure in the tech world, was known for his critical stance on AI practices. In October, he made headlines with an interview in The New York Times, expressing concerns about copyright violations by leading AI companies. After resigning from OpenAI in August due to ethical disagreements, Balaji became a key figure in the newspaper’s copyright case against the company.Days after his 26th birthday, Balaji was found dead in his San Francisco apartment on November 26. The San Francisco police ruled his death a suicide, citing CCTV footage that showed he was alone at the time.However, his supporters have raised serious questions about the circumstances surrounding his death. Despite the San Francisco police's stance that there is no evidence of foul play, Ramarao’s call for an FBI investigation is gaining major momentum and public support.","Poornima Ramarao is the mother of Suchir Balaji, a 26-year-old Indian-origin tech researcher.
