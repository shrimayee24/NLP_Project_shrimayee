NEW DELHI: Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat on Tuesday reiterated that Hindu families should consider having at least three children.Addressing a social-harmony meeting at the Saraswati Shishu Mandir in Lucknow, Bhagwat expressed concerns over what he described as a declining Hindu population and called for uniting and empowering the Hindu society.""There is a need to unite and empower Hindus. There is no threat to us but vigilance is necessary,"" Bhagwat said.Raising concerns over infiltration, Bhagwat said infiltrators should be ""detected, deleted and deported"", and should not be provided employment.He also said Hindu families should consider having at least three children, citing scientific opinions that societies with an average fertility rate of below three could disappear in the future.Bhagwat said newly-married couples should be made aware of this and added that the purpose of marriage is to carry forward creation, not merely fulfilling one's own desires.He said a lack of harmony leads to discrimination and stressed that all citizens share one country and one motherland.""The Sanatan thought is a philosophy of harmony,"" Bhagwat said, adding that differences that have emerged over time must be addressed through understanding and practice.Responding to a question on University Grants Commission (UGC) guidelines, Bhagwat said laws must be obeyed and if a law is flawed, there are constitutional ways to change it.He said caste divisions should not become a cause of conflict and called for uplifting the disadvantaged with a sense of belonging.Bhagwat said India would guide the world in the near future and that solutions to many global problems lie within the country's civilisational ethos.He said regular community-level meetings should promote social harmony, remove misconceptions and address social issues, while extending support to the weaker sections of the society.The RSS chief cautioned that some elements in the United States and China are working against India's social harmony, and called for vigilance and mutual trust.","Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat says Hindu families should consider having at least three children.

Yunus Rakes Up India's 'Seven Sisters' In Exit Speech, Hails Bangladesh's Ties With China

NEW DELHI: Muhammad Yunus 's reference to the northeastern states without recognising them as a part of India in his farewell address as the chief adviser of Bangladesh's interim govt drew a sharp takedown from BJP functionary Mahesh Jethmalani who said he has presided over a country that looks increasingly ""unmoored"".""Bangladesh deserves serious statecraft. Instead, it has got a headline-chasing interim figure who treats India as a prop.

""When you can't govern, you grandstand. When you can't stabilise your own country, you try to manufacture an external villain - preferably the neighbour that actually functions.Yunus, he said, wasn't elected and instead instigated a volatile interim perch and has since presided over a Bangladesh that looks increasingly unmoored. He speaks as if he is Bangladesh's permanent conscience and the irony is almost comic, Jethmalani said.""All he will be remembered for is a hubris that is beyond redemption whose ideological shape-shifting is the tell.

'New World Order Emerging, India Ready To Lead As Global Growth Engine', Says PM Modi At ET Summit

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Tuesday called upon the Indian IT sector to lead not just in service delivery but in building AI products, platforms and solutions that work for India and the world.""India's IT sector has been the backbone of our services exports and a key driver of economic growth. AI presents both a tremendous opportunity and a challenge for this sector... The fundamental shift is that AI isn't replacing the IT sector. It is transforming it,"" he told ANI.PM Narendra Modi said, ""While general-purpose AI tools have become widespread, enterprise-grade AI adoption is concentrated in specific sectors. Incumbent IT firms continue to play crucial roles in solving complex business problems.""Many saw the PM's remarks as nudging Indian software service players to develop new capabilities and work on products and platforms - something that many Indian IT companies are not known for despite sitting on large cash piles. Global tech giants are also facing challenges from AInative companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic.Modi said India must not only be a technology consumer but a creator too, a foundational pillar of the ' Atmanirbhar Bharat ' principle. ""My vision is that India should be among the top three AI superpowers globally, not just in AI consumption but in creation.Our AI models will be deployed worldwide, serving billions in their native languages. Our AI startups will be valued in hundreds of billions, creating millions of high-quality jobs,"" the PM said.The PM also sought to address concerns over the impact of AI on jobs, vowing to arm the youth with requisite skills. ""I understand the concern of our youth about AI-driven disruptions in the job market. Preparation is the best antidote to fear. That is why we have been investing in skilling and re-skilling our people for an AI-driven future... We're not approaching this as a future problem but we're treating it as a present imperative,"" he said.""History has shown that work does not disappear due to technology. Its nature changes and new types of jobs are created. While some jobs may be redefined, digital transformation will also add new tech jobs to India's economy.

How do the fares of Vande Bharat chair car trains compare to similar trains around the world? According to Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, the ticket prices for the Vande Bharat chair car are much lower than such trains operating in countries such France, China, and Japan.Vande Bharat chair car is an all air-conditioned service that was first introduced in 2019 and has since then expanded across the Indian Railways network. The self-propelled train set is said to be a world-class offering by the national transporter, allowing for better passenger amenities and faster train travel.Recently, Ashwini Vaishnaw informed the Lok Sabha that the fare for the Vande Bharat AC chair car for journeys covering around 300 to 400 kilometres is approximately Rs 2.19 per kilometre. This, he said, is significantly lower than comparable services in countries such as China, Japan and France.“The fare of Vande Bharat AC chair car over a journey between 300 and 400 kilometres is around Rs 2.19 per kilometre, which is much lower than the fares of similar segments of services in countries like China, Japan and France, where it ranges from Rs 7 to Rs 20 per kilometre,” Vaishnaw said.Also Read | How seven new high-speed rail corridors can transform train travel in India In his written reply, Vaishnaw said the Ministry of Railways determines passenger fares after considering multiple factors, including operational costs, the value and quality of services provided, the nature of facilities offered, affordability for passengers, competition from alternative modes of transport, and broader socio-economic considerations.Vande Bharat train services currently operate across 82 routes, running a total of 164 services. According to the minister, these trains function as a separate category within passenger services, featuring a different fare structure along with amenities such as improved suspension systems, quicker acceleration through semi-high-speed operations, automatic plug doors, ergonomic seating, mini pantry facilities, CCTV surveillance and the KAVACH safety system.Vaishnaw added that passenger affordability has remained a key consideration, and as a result, ticket prices for these trains have been maintained below the actual cost of providing the service.He further said, “The rationalised fare structure has facilitated the wider expansion of these services across the country, reflecting strong passenger demand for these services. Vande Bharat services have high occupancy level on all major routes with occupancy of Vande Bharat near 100 per cent, demonstrating a change in passenger preferences.”Commenting on fares in the ordinary class of other trains, Vaishnaw said these remain among the lowest when compared internationally.Drawing a comparison with neighbouring countries, he noted that the per-kilometre fare in India stands at about 20 paise, while the corresponding fares are 54 paise in Pakistan, 37 paise in Bangladesh and 51 paise in Sri Lanka.Recently a sleeper version of the Vande Bharat Express train has also been launched, and hundreds of such trains are planned for overnight train travel in the coming years.",Vande Bharat chair car is an all air-conditioned service that was first introduced in 2019.

PM Modi, Emmanuel Macron Vow Strong India-France Anti Terror Front, Signals Big G7-BRICS Bridge

NEW DELHI/BENGALURU: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday asked his French counterpart, minister of the armed forces and veterans affairs of France Catherine Vautrin, “to raise India-made component” in the upcoming deal for 114 Rafale fighter jets “by up to 50%”, defence sources told TOI.During their 6th India-France Annual Defence Dialogue in Bengaluru, Rajnath also told Vautrin to “try to ensure that the engines of the (fighter) planes are made and overhauled in India. This will help our ‘Make-in-India’ effort,” the sources quoted the minister as saying.The two ministers also discussed a range of bilateral security and defence issues, including priority areas for co-development and co-production of defence equipment. India and France also renewed their defence cooperation agreement for another 10 years, announced reciprocal deployment of army officers, and inked a pact to manufacture Hammer missiles in India. An MoU on JV was signed for the manufacturing of Hammer missiles by defence PSU Bharat Electronics Limited CMD and executive vice-president of Safran Electronics and Defence.Defence PSU Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) and France’s Safran company will form a JV to produce Hammer precision-guided munitions, used during Operation Sindoor, in India.Earlier, Rajnath and Vautrin attended the inaugural ceremony of the H125 Light Utility Helicopter final assembly line, jointly built by Tata Advanced Systems Ltd (TASL) and Airbus at Karnataka’s Vemagal, when PM Modi and French President Emmanuel Macron virtually inaugurated the facility from Mumbai.After the facility inauguration, Modi said, “We take pride in the fact that, together, India and France will manufacture in India the world's only helicopter capable of flying to the heights of Mount Everest and export it to the entire world.” The delivery of the first ‘Made in India’ H125 is expected in early 2027 and the helicopter will help meet the requirements of the Indian armed forces for a light multi-role helicopter and will essentially contribute to army operations on the icy heights of the Himalayas. Rajnath said the total investment for the H125 project is expected to exceed Rs 1,000 crore and create direct and indirect employment.In the presence of Modi in Mumbai, Macron said, “From Rafale jets to submarines, we are expanding defence cooperation. India and France are also working together to build a helicopter assembly line and fifth-gen fighter jet engines.”The President’s remark came days after Rajnath Singh-led Defence Acquisition Council gave the go-ahead for purchase of 114 Rafale jets from France. After Tuesday’s meet between Modi and Macron, the cost negotiations between two sides for the upcoming Rafale deal will get a big push and the agreement will be inked after the Cabinet’s clearance in near future.With Macron also talking about defence collaboration on submarines, India may buy additional Scorpene-class conventional submarines from France. India had already acquired six Scorpene-class submarines (Kalvari class) from France under the Project 75 programme.The French defence minister appreciated the conversion of Exercise Shakti with the Army from biennial to an annual event.During the meeting, Rajnath also raised the issue of Pakistan terrorism. He said Pakistan has a long history of nurturing, nourishing, and promoting cross-border terrorism to create disturbance and violence in India. This, he said, has created a serious threat to peace in the region.","Rajnath Singh asked his French counterpart, minister of the armed forces and veterans affairs of France Catherine Vautrin, “to raise India-made component” in the upcoming deal for 114 Rafale fighter jets.

NEW DELHI: BJP on Tuesday sharply criticised Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi over their opposition to the Great Nicobar island infrastructure project, accusing them of going to great lengths to derail it.

'World Recognises India’s AI Power': Norway To New Zealand Praise India As AI Impact Summit Begins

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Tuesday criticised the Centre over mismanagement at the ongoing AI Impact Summit in the national capital. Party president Mallikarjun Kharge called it an example of “PR hungry” government that had turned a global opportunity into “utter chaos”.In a post on X, Kharge said that what could have been a major moment for India’s digital and artificial intelligence leadership had instead resulted in distress for participants.“What could have been a showpiece AI Summit for the entire world demonstrating the digital & AI capabilities of India, has reportedly turned into utter chaos and rank mismanagement by this ‘PR hungry’ government!” he wrote.The Congress chief alleged that founders, exhibitors and visitors faced multiple problems during the event, particularly on the first day.“Founders, exhibitors and visitors - all face extreme distress due to the PM gatecrashing for a photo opportunity on the very first day,” Kharge said.Listing the complaints, he added, “Exhibitors are left without food and water, their products are stolen, Digi Yatra miserably fails, laptops, personal electronic devices and even bags are prohibited, only cash instead of digital/UPI payment is accepted, and founders are made to pay huge sums without basic facilities, among many other reasons of distress.”Calling it an embarrassment for the country, Kharge said, “It is extremely unfortunate that, our country has to suffer this global embarassment due to the incompetancy of our own government.”He also suggested that the Centre take lessons from a state-level technology event. “Perhaps the Modi Govt should learn from the Bengaluru Tech Summit (BTS) which is an annual feature in smoothly organising such large scale Digital & Tech congregations,” he wrote.Union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw acknowledged the issue and assured that all problems will be addressed.""If any issue or inconvenience has come to exhibitors at AI Summit, we apologise for that. All issues will be addressed,"" Vaishnaw said.The AI Impact Summit, which began on Monday at Bharat Mandapam in New Delhi, is being described as the world’s largest artificial intelligence gathering. The five-day event, running from February 16 to 20, has drawn thousands of participants, including tech leaders, policymakers, startup founders and industry experts.Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the summit, which will also see the participation of more than 20 heads of state and government, including France’s Emmanuel Macron and Brazil’s Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Technology leaders such as OpenAI’s Sam Altman and Google’s Sundar Pichai are also scheduled to attend.The summit aims to shape a “shared roadmap for global AI governance and collaboration” and focuses on themes of “People, Planet, and Progress”. India is positioning itself as a hub for digital infrastructure and artificial intelligence, and is expected to push for wider access to AI technologies and the creation of global AI commons.PTI reporters at the venue observed long queues outside session halls due to packed schedules and high demand. Organisers said that registrations exceeded expectations, reflecting growing global interest in AI infrastructure, enterprise adoption and governance.While there were reports of logistical challenges due to heavy footfall and parallel sessions running simultaneously, the event has seen strong participation, with panel discussions and exhibitions drawing large crowds.The government has highlighted the summit as an opportunity to showcase India’s digital public infrastructure, engineering talent and its ambitions to lead global conversations on responsible and inclusive AI development.",The Congress on Tuesday criticised the Centre over mismanagement at the ongoing AI Impact Summit in the national capital.

At the fag end of his life, he admitted his guilt and pleaded for amnesty.The judge held Jai Narayan guilty, and disposed of the case after imposing a fine of Rs 2,000 on him. He was spared a prison sentence because of his advanced age and debilitating condition.The special court also took notice of the fact that Jai Narayan had already refunded to UCO Bank the entire loan amount - approximately Rs 4 lakh - which he had fraudulently obtained 15 years ago for the purchase of a tractor on the basis of forged documents.CBI had registered the case in 2011 against fake borrowers and other accused persons, including employees of UCO Bank, who allegedly swindled public money under the garb of agricultural loan schemes in Jamui district of Bihar.The judge heard the matter for nearly 35 minutes on the road leading to Patna civil courts.","Jai Narayan Singh, a frail 95-year-old man, lay inside a vehicle, barely able to move his legs.

SC: Compensation is not a substitute for punishment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-compensation-is-not-a-substitute-for-punishment/articleshow/128483599.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: Sending a clear message to high courts and trial courts that a person convicted of a crime could not be let off with lenient punishment on agreeing to financially compensate the victim, Supreme Court on Tuesday said that such compensation could not be considered equivalent to or a substitute for punishment.A bench of Justices Rajesh Bindal and Vijay Bishnoi said that undue sympathy for the accused while imposing an inadequate sentence would do harm to society and erode public trust in the justice system. It expressed concern over the ""misplaced understanding"" of various high courts in treating compensation as a substitute for a sentence.""Compensation payable to the victim is only restitutory in nature, and it cannot be considered as equivalent to or a substitute for punishment. Punishment is punitive in nature, and its object is to create an adequate deterrence against the said crime and to send a social message to the miscreants that any violation of the moral norms of society would come with consequences, which cannot merely be purchased by money,"" Justice Bishnoi, who penned the judgment, said.The bench quashed a Madras high court order that had reduced a three-year jail term in an attempt to murder case to the sentence undergone by them (two months), after the two persons convicted agreed to pay Rs 50,000 each to the victim.It said the HC had acted in defiance of the law and made a travesty of established criminal jurisprudence in arriving at its conclusion.""The consideration to be kept in mind while awarding punishment is to ensure that the punishment should not be too harsh, but at the same time, it should also not be too lenient so as to undermine its deterrent effect... The objective of punishment is not to seek vengeance for the crime; rather, it is an attempt to reconstruct the damaged social fabric of society in order to pull back its wheel on the track,"" the bench said.SC said the provision of compensation had its roots in victimology, which acknowledged victims as the ""primary sufferers of the crime"" and advocated the idea of providing some relief from suffering.""The rationale behind victim compensation is to rehabilitate the victim for the loss and injury caused to them as a direct consequence of the crime or offence and not to exonerate the offender/accused from their culpability. The practice of enhancing the compensation payable to the victim and reducing the sentence, especially in cases of grave offence, is dangerous as it might send a wrong message to society that offenders/accused persons can absolve themselves from their liability by merely paying a monetary consideration,"" it said.""The misplaced understanding of various courts in treating compensation as a substitute for sentence is both a matter of concern and a practice which should be condemned,"" SC said, adding that it had observed a ""trend"" in HCs to reduce the sentences awarded by trial courts "" capriciously and mechanically, without any visible application of judicial mind"".",Supreme Court quashes a Madras high court order that had reduced a three-year jail term in an attempt to murder case to the sentence undergone by them (two months) Justices Rajesh Bindal and Vijay Bishnoi said that undue sympathy for the accused while imposing an inadequate sentence would do harm to society.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128483517,imgsize-54350,width-400,resizemode-4/supreme-court-timings-chart.jpg"

‘Justice Delayed Is Justice Destroyed’: CJI Kant Calls High Courts Key Guardians Of Citizens’ Rights

AI-provided fake quotes have made our job tougher: CJI

NEW DELHI: As heads of govts and tech giants brainstorm how to reap benefits of the artificial intelligence revolution and dodge the risks that it poses, Supreme Court has expressed alarm over the growing practice of advocates using AI tools to draft petitions, and in the process, quoting from fictional judgments.CJI Surya Kant said, ""We are alarmed to learn that lawyers are using AI to draft petitions. It is very unfortunate that the petitions quote non-existent paragraphs from judgments,"" Justice B V Nagarathna said, ""A non-existent judgment Mercy vs Mankind was cited.""CJI Kant said there are several instances of such non-existent judgments having been cited in petitions, which were detected by Justice Dipankar Datta, echoing the concern in the US and other countries over the ""hallucination"" by large learning models.""There are instances where the petition quotes several paragraphs from a judgment of SC. But on scrutiny it was found that these paragraphs do not exist in the judgment,"" Justice Nagarathna said.CJI Kant said, ""It makes the judges' task more difficult. Now, they must not only go through the pleadings, but also scrutinise the authenticity of every paragraph quoted from cited judgments.""Recently, Bombay high court imposed a cost of Rs 50,000 on Heart and Soul Entertainment Ltd for submitting AI-generated arguments citing a non-existent case.HC said, ""A strong pointer is seen from a reference made to one alleged caselaw 'Jyoti w/o Dinesh Tulsiani Vs. Elegant Associates'. Neither citation is given nor a copy of judgment is supplied by the Respondent. This court and its law clerks were at pains to find out this case law but could not find it. """"This has resulted in the waste of precious judicial time. If an AI tool is used in aid of research, it is welcome; however, there is great responsibility upon the party, even an advocate using such tools, to cross verify the references and make sure that the material generated by the machine/computer is relevant, genuine and in existence,"" HC said.Last Sept, Delhi high court had found a petitioner indulging in ""AI hallucination"" as it relied on paragraphs from two judgements, one which does not exist and in another the quoted paragraphs did not exist.Last month, Andhra Pradesh HC had refused to quash an order of a trial court judge who had passed an order relying on AI-prompted non-existent ruling. HC said though the citation was wrong, the legal principles applied by the trial judge were correct and in consonance with settled law.In March last year, Karnataka HC had taken adverse note of a city civil judge relying on non-existent SC judgments to pass an order and had said that this would require further inquiry.The bench of CJI Kant and Justices Nagarathna and Joymalya BagchiTuesday also recalled how crisp petitions used to be drafted by senior advocate and former law minister A K Sen.","CJI Surya Kant said, ""We are alarmed to learn that lawyers are using AI to draft petitions"" CJI Kant said there are several instances of such non-existent judgments having been cited in petitions.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has ruled that development isn't an absolute goal and that the right to a clean environment, which is part of the right to life, cannot be traded off with economic benefits.Declining permission for change of land for a cement factory to come up at Sangrur, Punjab, close to farms and a school, a bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta also quashed Central Pollution Control Board's revised industrial sector categorisation issued in Jan 2025, in which a ""stand-alone grinding unit without captive power plant"" was put in 'orange' category from 'red', allowing these near inhabited areas.Writing the judgment, Justice Nath said, ""Economic development and industrial growth are legitimate and important objectives... However, in a constitutional framework founded on rule of law, development isn't an abstract or absolute goal. It's conditioned by the non-derogable obligation to protect life, health and environmental integrity.""""Development that undermines these foundational values ceases to be constitutionally permissible development.When developmental activity poses a credible risk to human health or environmental safety, regulatory frameworks must err on the side of protection,"" he said.The Supreme Court said the Constitution does not permit a trade-off where civilian life and health are exposed to foreseeable harm on the assumption that economic benefit or industrial facilitation justifies such exposure.""Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India do not tolerate a regulatory calculus that treats environmental safety as negotiable,"" it said.Faulting the reclassification of industries and the dilution of the restrictions on locations without considering their proximity to habitation and ill-effect on environment, Justices Nath and Mehra said, ""Sector-level reclassification, divorced from exposure realities and local sensitivities, would become a ready instrument to justify siting of polluting activities near habitations, schools, and other sensitive receptors. """"Such an approach would not remain confined to the present case. It would operate as a precedent, enabling progressive erosion of preventive safeguards across regions, with cumulative and irreversible consequences. The law does not permit environmental protection to be weakened incrementally until harm becomes inevitable,"" the bench said.It said environmental degradation is mostly irreversible. ""A regulatory framework that allows risk to materialise first and seeks to address consequences later is fundamentally incompatible with constitutional environmental jurisprudence,"" it said. It said courts are slow to interfere with the developmental and economic activities of the state.","The Supreme Court has ruled that development isn't an absolute goal. The right to a clean environment, which is part of the right to life, cannot be traded off with economic benefits. The court also quashed Central Pollution Control Board's revised industrial sector categorisation issued in Jan 2025.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128481710,imgsize-15598,width-400,resizemode-4/supreme-court.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Days after its announcement in the Budget, the agriculture ministry on Tuesday launched AI-enabled ‘Bharat-VISTAAR’ (Virtually Integrated System to Access Agricultural Resources) that will help farmers in farm-level decision-making by receiving date-driven customised digital advisory.Launched at a time when India is hosting the AI Impact Summit, Bharat-VISTAAR is a multilingual AI tool that will integrate the AgriStack portals and the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) package on farm practices with AI systems.Its use is expected to enhance farm productivity, enable better decisions for farmers and reduce risk by providing customised advisory support related to weather, market prices, pests and diseases, soil health, crop management, and information on major central govt schemes.Calling Bharat-VISTAAR a platform of “ask and get direct answers”, agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said farmers will neither have to make rounds of offices nor struggle with digital applications.“They will now just have to dial 155261 by picking up a mobile phone and ask any farm-related question. They will get immediate answer in one’s local language about which medicine (pesticide/insecticide) to apply, when to sow and what rates (of selling price of crops) are available in the markets of Jaipur, Jodhpur, Udaipur, Delhi or Mumbai,” Chouhan said while launching the first phase of Bharat-VISTAAR.The scheme, which is devised as an “AI-based digital security shield”, has initially been started in Hindi and English languages. Farmers will eventually be able to interact in 11 languages under the system in future.Chouhan said a farmer identity card was also being created under the system that would contain all information about the farmer. “Preparations are underway to connect the entire agricultural system with the Bharat VISTAAR scheme,” he added.Currently, a couple of central schemes such as ‘Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana’ and ‘Soil Health Card’ have been included in this scheme. Information about all major central schemes for farmers will be available through it in due course.The minister on the occasion also unveiled AI Hackathon focused on farmers and ‘Agri Kosh AI Strategy Roadmap’, emphasising innovative solutions for agricultural challenges.","Bharat-VISTAAR is a multilingual AI tool that will integrate the AgriStack portals and the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) package on farm practices with AI systems.

""Marseille is the city from where our Indian soldiers set foot in Europe during World War I. Their saga of bravery is still remembered in many parts of Europe, and it is the same city where freedom fighter Veer Savarkar jumped into the sea to escape the British. His action symbolised his unwavering resolve for India's independence.""

""I had the opportunity to remember and pay my respects to him in Marseille last year. This time, when president Macron is in India for the AI Impact Summit, we are fortunate to welcome him in Mumbai, the Gateway to India.""

""The year 2026 marks a significant turning point in relations between India and Europe. Just a few days ago, India signed the largest and most ambitious Free Trade Agreement in its history with the European Union. This landmark agreement is set to create unprecedented momentum not only in India-Europe relations but also in ties between India and France.""

""To further encourage mutual investment, we are signing agreements to eliminate double taxation, ensuring that our citizens and companies are not taxed twice. These initiatives will boost bilateral trade, investment, and the movement of people. Together, they form the roadmap for our shared prosperity.

“Deal Is A Key Priority For Both Sides” Us Expert Lauds India-Us Trade Pact

Parliamentary approval process underway

Double contributions convention to be implemented in parallel

Tariff reductions and market access

The India-UK free trade agreement signed in July last year is expected to be implemented from April 2026, a government official said.India and the United Kingdom signed the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) on July 24, 2025, under which 99 per cent of Indian exports will enter the British market at zero duty, while India will reduce tariffs on a range of British goods including cars and whisky.“We are expecting the pact to be implemented from April this year,” the official said, as quoted by news agency PTI.The agreement requires approval from the UK Parliament before it can take effect. In India, such trade agreements are cleared by the Union Cabinet.According to PTI, after ratification by the British Parliament, the pact will be implemented on a mutually agreed date. The House of Commons held a debate on the India-UK CETA earlier this week.Chris Bryant, minister of state in the UK Department for Business and Trade, responded during the debate on behalf of the Labour government, describing CETA as a significant achievement that goes “well beyond India's precedent in opening the door for UK businesses”.The British Parliament is currently ratifying the agreement, including debates in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords, along with committee reviews, before implementation in the coming months.Alongside CETA, the two countries have signed a Double Contributions Convention (DCC) pact to prevent temporary workers from having to pay social security contributions in both countries.The official said both CETA and the DCC are likely to be implemented in parallel, as per PTI.CETA aims to double bilateral trade, currently estimated at $56 billion, between the world’s fifth and sixth largest economies by 2030.Under the agreement, India will reduce import duties on Scotch whisky from 150 per cent to 75 per cent immediately, with a further reduction to 40 per cent by 2035.Also read| India-UK trade deal: From 99% duty-free access to benefits for Indian professionals - Here’s the FTA in 10 big numbers Import duties on automobiles will be cut to 10 per cent over five years from the current levels of up to 110 per cent, under a quota-based liberalisation system.In return, Indian exporters are set to gain improved access to the UK market for goods such as textiles, footwear, gems and jewellery, sports goods and toys.India has also agreed to lower tariffs on British consumer products including chocolates, biscuits and cosmetics.During his visit to India in 2025, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer expressed the desire for the agreement to be implemented as soon as “humanly possible.”Speaking in Mumbai in October last year, Starmer described the trade deal as Britain’s largest post-Brexit trade achievement and said he had instructed his team to ensure it is executed “as quickly as humanly possible”.Also read| India-UK trade deal: Starmer wants FTA implementation as soon as 'humanly possible'! The agreement was signed during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to London in July 2025.Economists estimate the pact could increase trade between the two countries by about £25.5 billion ($34 billion) by 2040, with UK officials describing that figure as a starting point for further growth.If implemented as expected in April 2026, the agreement would mark a significant step in expanding bilateral economic ties and reducing tariff barriers across key sectors.","India and the United Kingdom signed the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) on July 24, 2025.

End Of MGNREGA? What VB–G Ram G Means For Rural Workers, Farmers And Viksit Bharat Plan

Allocation pattern across key schemes

Sharp cut in MGNREGS allocation

Fund-sharing pattern and fiscal implications

Employment trends under MGNREGS

PMAY-G progress and challenges

VB-G RAM G, the scheme set to replace Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), has received the highest share in this year’s Budget for the department of rural development, accounting for about 40 per cent of its total allocation, according to an analysis by PRS Legislative Research.The PRS analysis said VB-G RAM G has been allocated Rs 95,692 crore in the Budget, making up around 40 per cent of the Department of Rural Development’s total outlay.The Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Gramin (PMAY-G) accounts for 23 per cent of the department’s Budget. This is followed by MGNREGS at 12 per cent, the National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) at 8 per cent, the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) at 8 per cent, and the National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP) at 4 per cent, as per news agency PTI.In 2026–27, VB-G RAM G (40 per cent) and PMAY-G (23 per cent) together account for 63 per cent of the ministry’s total gross expenditure, followed by MGNREGS (12 per cent), NRLM (8 per cent), PMGSY (8 per cent) and NSAP (4 per cent), the report said.The ministry of rural development has been allocated Rs 1,97,023 crore in 2026–27, which is 4 per cent higher than the revised estimates for 2025–26.Within this, the department of rural development has been allocated Rs 1,94,369 crore, 4 per cent higher than the revised estimates of 2025–26.The department of land resources has been allocated Rs 2,654 crore, marking a 51 per cent increase over last year’s revised estimates.The allocation for MGNREGS this year stands at Rs 30,000 crore, 66 per cent lower than the revised estimate of Rs 88,000 crore last year, as per PTI.In contrast, most other schemes have seen higher allocations. PMAY-G has been allocated Rs 54,917 crore, reflecting a 66 per cent increase over the previous fiscal year’s revised estimate.PMGSY has received Rs 19,000 crore, a 73 per cent rise compared to last year’s revised estimate.The report noted that under MGNREGS, wage payments accounted for around 70 per cent of total expenditure over the last five years. Material costs made up about 26 per cent of expenditure, of which roughly 20 per cent was borne by the Centre. Overall, the Centre bore around 90 per cent of the total expenditure under the scheme.“With the change in fund sharing pattern under the VB-G RAM G Act, the expenditure by state governments on the scheme may increase,” the report said.Under the VB-G RAM G Act, which guarantees 125 days of work, the Centre and states will share expenditure in a 60:40 ratio. For northeastern and Himalayan states, the ratio will be 90:10, as per PTI.According to the analysis, over the past decade, employment under MGNREGS averaged around 48 days per household per year.Less than 10 per cent of participating households completed 100 days of work. In 2020–21, average days of employment rose to 52 days per household due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Employment generation moderated thereafter, recording 50 days per household in 2024–25, reported PTI.On average, seven crore households demanded work during 2017–25, of which six crore households, around 90 per cent, were able to avail employment.The report also highlighted that actual wages paid to workers have often been lower than the notified rates. In 2025–26 (as of December 2025), wages received by workers were below the notified wage rate in 20 out of 31 states and Union Territories.For instance, in Andhra Pradesh, workers received Rs 268 against a notified Rs 307. In Chhattisgarh, workers were paid Rs 245 compared to Rs 261, and in Gujarat, Rs 264 against Rs 288.In Karnataka, workers received Rs 342 compared to the notified Rs 370. The gap was wider in Rajasthan (Rs 221 versus Rs 281) and Tamil Nadu (Rs 268 versus Rs 336), while in Telangana workers received Rs 259 against a notified Rs 307.Under rural housing, PMAY-G has been allocated Rs 54,917 crore, a 69 per cent increase, according to the report.However, only around 70 per cent of the targeted houses across phases have been completed so far.Delays have been attributed to issues such as land availability, migration, Covid-related disruptions and beneficiary-level constraints, the report said.","VB-G RAM G has been allocated Rs 95,692 crore in the Budget, making up around 40 per cent of the Department of Rural Development’s total outlay.

Actor Rajpal Yadav has been released from Tihar Jail today on an interim bail in Rs 9 crore cheque bounce case. The next hearing will take place on March 18 and till then, the actor has been released. As he thanked the country, fans and Bollywood for all the support, now the businessman who had filed a case against the actor, has finally spoken on the matter. Businessman Madhav Gopal Agrawal, who had loaned Rs 5 crore to the actor for his 2012 directorial venture 'Ata Pata Laapata', has spoken out about the prolonged legal dispute.Agrawal revealed how his association with Rajpal began and how the financial disagreement unfolded over the past 14 years. He revealed in a conversation with News Pinch, A that during the early phase of the conflict, he visited the actor’s residence and ""cried in front of him like a child,"" explaining that the funds he had lent were themselves borrowed from others. He said he repeatedly requested Rajpal to provide a specific date so a fresh agreement could be drafted.Agrawal, who represents M/s Murali Projects Pvt Ltd, said he was first introduced to the actor by MP Mithilesh Kumar Katheria.According to him, Rajpal had insisted that the film was nearly complete and that without immediate financial support, ""everything would go to waste"".Initially hesitant, Agrawal claimed he eventually agreed to the loan after Rajpal’s wife, Radha, sent him emotional messages appealing for help. He emphasized that the agreement clearly stated that repayment would not be influenced by the film’s box office performance, censor certification, or any other hurdle. The actor, he said, had also provided a personal guarantee.The businessman added that the transaction was strictly a loan and not an investment, noting that investments typically do not involve personal guarantees or post-dated cheques.When repayment deadlines passed without payment, Agrawal contacted Rajpal, who allegedly told him he lacked the funds. This led to three supplementary agreements being signed, along with the issuance of new cheques.Agrawal further recounted that when megastar Amitabh Bachchan attended the film’s music launch event, he realised that, as per the agreement, the negatives and payment were to be handed over once the film was completed. Consequently, he approached the court seeking a stay on the film’s release.According to Agrawal, Rajpal later assured him that repayment would only be possible after the film hit theatres. Trusting this assurance, he agreed to a settlement and had the stay order lifted. However, the film failed commercially.By 2013, with no resolution in sight, Agrawal moved court again. Following judicial intervention, a settlement amount of Rs 10.40 crore was agreed upon. Though Rajpal issued several cheques toward the payment, all were dishonoured, pushing the matter further into legal proceedings.Concluding his remarks, Agrawal stated that as a businessman, his sole objective is to recover his money.","Rajpal Yadav released from Tihar Jail today on an interim bail in Rs 9 crore cheque bounce case.

Elon Musk addressed speculation about his growing fortune

Tesla still a major contributor to Elon Musk’s wealth

'India Must Find Its Own Elon Musk': Ex-DGMO Emphasises Superiority In Space Tech To Win Future Wars

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has finally addressed the speculation about his growing fortune. Musk noted that his $849.3 billion net worth is overwhelmingly tied to his ownership stakes in Tesla and SpaceX. Responding to a post on X about wealth creation, Musk said he has already created wealth “thousands of times over.” He added: “My ‘net worth’ is almost entirely due to my ownership stakes in Tesla and SpaceX. I have <0.1% that is cash.”A post shared by Kalshi (web-based prediction market platform) shared a post on X (formerly known as Twitter) in which it claimed that there are 75% chances of Elon Musk becoming a trillionaire this year. Responding to the post, Musk wrote “Already have thousands of times over. My “net worth” is almost entirely due to my ownership stakes in Tesla and SpaceX. I have <0.1% that is cash. Tesla and SpaceX employees all receive stock/options and Tesla is >80% owned by retail investors and index/pension funds, so value increases apply >80% to them. ”Musk emphasised that employees at both Tesla and SpaceX receive stock and options, while Tesla itself is “>80% owned by retail investors and index/pension funds.”His comments highlight how his fortune is largely paper wealth, dependent on the valuation of his companies rather than liquid assets.Speculation about Musk becoming the world’s first trillionaire has intensified. Prediction market Kalshi shows a 78% probability of Musk reaching a $1 trillion net worth before 2027. The odds rose after SpaceX merged with xAI, valuing the combined entity at about $1.25 trillion. Musk’s estimated 43% stake in the new company is worth more than $530 billion.Elon Musk owns around 12% stake in Tesla, valued at $178 billion along with stock options worth another $124 billion. These figures exclude the record-breaking pay package approved by Tesla shareholders in November, which could grant Musk up to $1 trillion in additional stock if Tesla manages to hit the ambitious ‘Mars shot’ milestones including an eightfold increase in market cap over the next decade.","Elon Musk addressed speculation about his growing fortune.

“Illegal child labor”: MrBeast says child labor crisis in cocoa farms inspired him to launch Feastables,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/illegal-child-labor-mrbeast-says-child-labor-crisis-in-cocoa-farms-inspired-him-to-launch-feastables/articleshow/128452589.cms,"MrBeast says the widespread use of child labor in cocoa farming inspired him to launch Feastables as an ethical alternative to traditional chocolate brands. Citing over 1.5 million children in illegal labor, he emphasizes responsible sourcing and transparency. While experts note the issue is complex, his stance has renewed debate about supply chains, consumer responsibility, and ethical food production.

MrBeast turns snack brand into statement against child labor practices





Jimmy “MrBeast” Donaldson is known for viral challenges and jaw-dropping giveaways. Now he is drawing attention for something far less flashy but far more serious. The YouTube megastar says the chocolate industry’s long-standing child labor problem pushed him to build a different kind of snack company. His brand, Feastables, is based on ethical sourcing and supply chain transparency on a time when consumers want to see rather than hear.Feastables was a new chocolate brand introduced by its creator in 2022 amidst a saturated market dominated by long-established brands. Rather than relying solely on the appeal to celebrities, he positioned the brand as an alternative, which is values-based. Donaldson is of the opinion that modern consumers, particularly young people are very concerned with the way their product is manufactured and where they were sourced.MrBeast recently highlighted a troubling statistic tied to cocoa production: “Over 1 million children work in child labor on cocoa farms so you can have cheap chocolate. I want to prove that this is a choice and not a necessity with Feastables. Can’t wait for you all to see what we’ve been working on last 18 months. I’m thousands of hours deep on solving this. Won’t quit.""Cocoa farm child labor is highest in West Africa where poverty, poor regulation, and trade networks are hard to manage.The big chocolate firms have been promising reforms over a long time, but watchdog bodies still report a slow pace. Those discrepancies between the committed actions and quantifiable improvement have left a room in which new brands can make claims of cleaner sourcing at the very beginning.Feastables positions itself as a company that responsibly sources cocoa and has open partnerships. Analysts believe ethical sourcing is no longer a specialized selling point. It is turning out to be an expectation. The sheer scale of the reach of Donaldson in his online is a luxury. Millions of people listen when he speaks, and a lot of them are prepared to make their buying choices according to their values.Still, experts caution that solving child labor in cocoa production requires more than brand messaging. It demands economic reform, education access, and stronger governance in producing nations. Even so, Donaldson’s public stance has sparked renewed discussion about ethical consumption.By tying entertainment influence to supply chain ethics, MrBeast is testing whether digital creators can shape not only trends but also industry standards.","MrBeast turns snack brand into statement against child labor practices.

The enduring premium on leadership



Technology: Present, but no longer dominant

The rise of the experience economy

How the rankings were determined

A recalibrated definition of success

On a crowded Monday morning in Bengaluru, a young medical resident scrolls through job listings between patient rounds. Across town, a civil engineer studies blueprints for a housing project that will alter a neighbourhood skyline. In a glass-walled office, a finance chief prepares to sign off on a multi-crore expansion plan. They work in different worlds. Yet in 2026, the labour market has placed them on the same pedestal.According to the newly released India’s Best Jobs 2026 list by Indeed, the country’s most promising careers no longer belong overwhelmingly to coders. Instead, healthcare specialists, infrastructure professionals and seasoned leaders have emerged as the defining faces of opportunity.The data, based on pay transparency and year-on-year hiring growth, reveals not just who earns well, but where India is betting its future.Topping the rankings is the dermatologist, with a mean monthly salary of ₹93,411 and an astonishing 182% surge in job postings between 2024 and 2025. Surgeons and medical officers also feature prominently.Behind these numbers are longer queues at clinics, rising lifestyle-related conditions, and expanding private healthcare chains.Employers are not merely filling vacancies; they are racing to secure expertise.Step outside the hospital, and the cranes tell another story. Quantity surveyors recorded a remarkable 198% increase in postings. Realtors saw 191% growth. Senior civil engineers, architects, and electrical designers all posted triple-digit hiring gains.A senior civil engineer now earns on average ₹42,526 per month. A senior architect earns ₹48,457. These are not speculative spikes; they are signals of sustained infrastructure momentum. As projects grow more complex, employers are seeking professionals who can deliver at scale and on deadline.The skyline is becoming a career map.Even in a diversifying market, authority carries weight. The Chief Financial Officer ranks second overall, with a mean monthly salary of ₹82,528 and a 171% increase in postings. Heads of sales, heads of marketing, principals, and human resources managers also feature among the top roles.These jobs rarely trend on social media. Yet they sit at the centre of decision-making, balancing budgets, steering growth, and navigating uncertainty. Companies, it appears, are willing to pay handsomely for judgement.Technology roles have not disappeared. The Python developer remains on the list, earning ₹34,798 per month. But hiring growth for the role stood at 0% year-on-year. That figure may be the most telling statistic in the entire ranking.For over a decade, tech defined aspiration. In 2026, it shares the stage. The economy looks broader, less concentrated, more layered.Elsewhere on the list are social media managers, interior designers and travel consultants — roles that speak to changing lifestyles.Travel consultants saw a 189% increase in postings. Social media managers recorded 138% growth. Businesses are investing not only in production, but in perception and experience.Consumers want more than functionality. They want design, storytelling and curated journeys. The job market is responding accordingly.Indeed’s Best Jobs 2026 list was compiled by analysing Indian job posting data across five metrics: median salary in 2025, job volume, salary growth from 2022 to 2025, job posting growth over the same period, and availability of remote work options.To ensure reliability, only roles with at least 20% pay transparency and a minimum of 1,000 postings in 2025 were included. The emphasis was on sustained strength, not fleeting hiring bursts.The 2026 rankings tell a larger story about ambition in India. The highest rewards are flowing to those who heal, those who build, and those who lead. Technical skills remain valuable, but they are part of a wider mosaic.In clinics, construction sites, classrooms, and boardrooms, a quieter transformation is underway. The country’s growth is no longer tethered to a single sector. It is spreading, across industries, across cities, across skill sets.And for millions scanning job portals in search of direction, that shift may be the most reassuring statistic of all.","India’s most promising careers no longer belong overwhelmingly to coders.

Draft Income Tax Rules 2026: The Income Tax Department has released a new set of draft income tax rules, which once finalised, will be applicable for financial year 2026-27. There are several changes in the draft income tax rules that impact the way you pay income tax, withdraw cash, pay in cash etc. and the need to quote your PAN card number for a variety of transactions.Following the release of the draft rules, the government has invited comments and suggestions from stakeholders, with February 22, 2026 set as the deadline for submitting feedback. After reviewing the responses received, the revised rules will be finalised, formally notified, and are expected to take effect from April 1, 2026.Under the proposed framework, the threshold limits for several transactions requiring PAN Card details to be disclosed have undergone a change.One of the main changes related to mandatory quoting of PAN Card relates to the limit for quoting PAN in transactions involving the purchase or sale of immovable property has been raised from Rs 10 lakh to Rs 20 lakh.Also Read | Draft Income Tax Rules 2026 explained: How you can save Rs 1.41 lakh tax outgo - top points on HRA, PAN changes Similarly, the requirement to disclose PAN for cash deposits has been modified, increasing the threshold from Rs 50,000 in a single day to cash deposits of Rs 10 lakh or more during a financial year in a bank, cooperative bank, or post office.The draft also proposes that PAN Card details be shared if the total cash withdrawals reach Rs 10 lakh or more in a financial year across one or multiple accounts held by an individual.Under the current rules, PAN must be quoted when cash deposits of more than Rs 50,000 in a single day at a bank or post office are made. The draft income tax rules seek to revise this by introducing a higher threshold, requiring PAN details to be shared when total cash deposits are of Rs 10 lakh or more during a financial year across multiple accounts. The same annual limit has also been proposed for cash withdrawals, making PAN mandatory once withdrawals reach Rs 10 lakh in a financial year.If you buy a motor vehicle at present, the PAN Card details are required for all, excluding motorcycles. However, as per the proposed new income tax rules, PAN disclosure is compulsory only when the value of your motor vehicle or motorcycle is over Rs 5 lakh.Currently, PAN must be provided for payments made towards hotel or restaurant bills of over Rs 50,000. The draft rules suggest increasing this threshold to Rs 1 lakh.Existing regulations require PAN to be quoted for property transactions valued above Rs 10 lakh. The proposal recommends raising this limit to Rs 20 lakh.At present, PAN Card details are required when insurance premium payments are made above Rs 50,000. The draft income tax rules broaden this requirement. They extend the need for PAN Card to any account-based relationship maintained with insurance companies.","The draft income tax rules have been released by the Income Tax Department.

JABALPUR: ""I didn't argue emotionally — I simply placed the law as it is,"" said Atharva Chaturvedi, 19, a NEET aspirant recalling the moment he stood before the country's highest court with the Constitution and past judgments to support his case.Atharva cleared NEET 2024–25 with 530 marks out of 720 as an EWS candidate, but he was left out of the admission process because a clearly implemented EWS reservation policy was absent in private medical colleges in Madhya Pradesh. He chose to fight the case himself without engaging a senior advocate.Atharva said he argued his own case before the Madhya Pradesh High Court and the Supreme Court of India and secured relief after he was denied MBBS admission under the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) quota in private medical colleges in Madhya Pradesh.Before the High Court, he cited the 103rd Constitutional Amendment and said Articles 15(6) and 16(6) mandated 10% EWS reservation in private, non-minority educational institutions. The court directed the state to complete the process of increasing seats and implementing EWS reservation in private medical colleges within a year.However, the policy remained unimplemented in the following admission cycle. Despite securing an EWS rank of 164 in NEET 2025–26, he again did not get admission and moved the apex court through an online petition.On Feb 10, as a bench headed by Chief Justice Surya Kant was rising for the day, Atharva Chaturvedi sought 10 minutes to present his case, and the bench agreed.Invoking its powers under Article 142, the Supreme Court observed that the petitioner was denied admission due to circumstances beyond his control and that state authorities failed to comply with earlier judicial directions.The court directed the National Medical Commission and the Madhya Pradesh govt to ensure his admission to an MBBS course in a private medical college, and warned that further delay would cause irreversible harm to a deserving candidate.""I was nervous initially,"" Atharva told TOI, ""but I studied the earlier orders carefully. I knew the law was on my side, so I just followed the legal provisions.""He said his advocate father, Manoj Chaturvedi, helped him understand previous judgments, but said the decision to argue his case personally was deliberate. ""Travelling to Delhi repeatedly was difficult and expensive. That's why I chose to file the petition online and appear virtually,"" he said.Court observers said the bench was struck by the clarity with which he explained constitutional intent, reservation policy and administrative lapses, which they said was rarely seen even among experienced lawyers.As people asked him why he wanted medicine degree when, they said, the courtroom seemed to be calling, Atharva continued preparing for NEET with the aim of becoming a doctor.","Atharva Chaturvedi, 19, was denied MBBS admission under the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) quota in private medical colleges in Madhya Pradesh.

MEERUT: A case has been registered at Delhi Gate police station of Meerut against a woman and her daughter for allegedly residing in India for a prolonged period without Indian citizenship.The action follows a police inquiry based on a complaint filed by a local resident. Authorities stated that the allegations are currently under investigation.According to complainant Rukhsana, Farhat Masood traveled to Pakistan in 1988 and married a Pakistani national, Saba alias Naji (now 56). It is alleged that Saba later came to India and, in 1993, brought their daughter Aiman Farhat (now 33), who was born in Pakistan, into the country on a Pakistani passport.The complaint claims that Indian citizenship was never obtained for the daughter. The complaint further alleges that the mother and daughter procured identity documents on the basis of forged papers and used them for travel purposes. Rukhsana also raised serious allegations that Saba's relatives have links with Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI and expressed suspicion that the two may have gathered information from sensitive locations in India.SP (City) Ayush Vikram Singh, ""On the basis of a preliminary inquiry, a case has been filed and Saba Masood has been arrested. Investigation is on about other allegations, and action will be taken accordingly.""The case was filed under BNS sections 318 (4) (cheating), 336 (3) forgery, 340(2) using forget documents as genuine and 351 (criminal intimidation).The family, however, refuted the charges. ""My mother travelled to Pakistan when she was eight-month pregnant. She was supposed to return before the delivery, but experienced labour pains in the eight month and Aiman was born prematurely. The mother could not have come back without the infant and the Indian consulate gave permission to travel. Besides, as per the Section 3 of the Indian Citizenship Act, a child's citizenship is decided by the citizenship of her father. So, automatically Aiman becomes an Indian citizen,"" said Faraz Farhat, Aiman's brother and lawyer representing the family's case.Regarding the allegations of ISI links, Farhat said, ""These allegations are baseless.""Notably, TOI had covered a report in 2019 -- ‘27 years after marriage with Meerut man, Pak woman awaits Indian Citizenship' – in which it had highlighted how Saba Farhat (Aiman's mother) had been waiting for Indian citizenship for the last 27 years.The family sources also revealed that the matter was raked up due to a family dispute pertaining to the legacy of the pioneers of the band industry -- Nadir Ali -- that Meerut is famous for.",A case has been registered against a woman and her daughter for allegedly residing in India for a prolonged period without Indian citizenship. The action follows a police inquiry based on a complaint filed by a local resident.

‘Crucial Role For India In AI Governance’: Duncan Cass-Beggs At AI Summit

Indian IT Sector Resilient?

Striking a Note of Caution

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Indian IT sector stocks have been bleeding for the last few days, facing a massive selloff on increasing fears that artificial intelligence (AI) tools and models will hit the basic revenue model of the technology sector.The index tracking Indian IT sector stocks such as Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. and Infosys Ltd. has lost a massive $56 billion in market capitalization after Anthropic PBC introduced a tool that some market participants consider a potential challenge to traditional outsourcing business models.But is the situation really so bad for the Indian IT sector? Does the future look bleak, or is the scare around impact of AI overdone?According to a Bloomberg analysis, for investors who remain positive about India’s IT services sector, the recent ‘AI scare trade’ has opened a window to accumulate stocks of companies which are viewed as capable of coming out strong amid pessimistic forecasts about the industry’s future.The brutal selloff in Indian technology stocks has been particularly noticeable across Asia, where the region’s strong hardware manufacturing base continues to be regarded as essential to the broader artificial intelligence ecosystem.The NSE Nifty IT Index has declined by about 15% since the announcement made earlier this month by Anthropic PBC, putting it on course for its steepest monthly fall since March 2020.Although technology stocks in China and Australia with significant software exposure have also come under pressure, the drop has drawn particular attention in India, where IT companies have long been regarded as key drivers of the country’s economic growth narrative.Strategists at HSBC Holdings Plc and JPMorgan Chase & Co. believe the concerns may be exaggerated, noting that Indian IT companies could benefit as more enterprises seek assistance in adopting and embedding AI solutions within their operations. Investors such as PPFAS Mutual Fund also argue that the industry has the flexibility to adjust effectively to evolving technological demands.“Whenever a major technological change occurs, IT firms have historically adapted by upgrading skills and aligning services with client requirements,” Raunak Onkar, research head and fund manager at the $17 billion fund house, which increased its exposure to Indian software companies last month was quoted as saying by Bloomberg.He added that these businesses have consistently succeeded by delivering cost-effective expertise at speed.This constructive outlook reflects expectations among some investors that the recent decline in Indian IT stocks could eventually reverse. Globally, tech stocks have borne the brunt amid concerns about how AI-driven tools might affect companies, especially those whose business models rely on delivering efficiency and productivity improvements for clients.India’s IT outsourcing industry first gained global recognition in the late 1990s when it assisted Western corporations in addressing the Y2K problem, a computer-related risk that threatened widespread disruptions at the turn of the millennium.Since that period, these companies have navigated multiple global economic slowdowns and technological transitions, adapting through phases that included the emergence of mobile communications and the expansion of cloud computing.At present, concerns have emerged that advances in artificial intelligence and robotics could undermine the traditional software services model. However, analysts such as Stephen Bersey of HSBC Holdings Plc argue that such assumptions are misguided and lack logical grounding.In a note dated February 9, Stephen Bersey said that software is important for coordinating interactions between AI-generated outputs and the existing enterprise systems. It is crucial to enable smooth digital operations across AI and non-AI components. He is of the view that Indian IT firms have spent decades developing and delivering enterprise-grade software solutions at scale, and this positions them well in this evolving landscape.Despite this optimism, some observers remain cautious. Critics argue that the efficiency gains delivered by AI could ultimately reduce revenue potential for outsourcing firms. According to Phanisekhar Ponangi, co-founder of Mavenark Asset Managers Pvt., the concerns surrounding AI’s impact on the sector should not be dismissed lightly.He said that for nearly three decades, information technology companies built their success on the promise of delivering higher efficiency for clients. According to him, the sector now faces a significant transition as artificial intelligence shortens project timelines and lowers workforce requirements, with “the client will pocket the productivity gains.”Some market experts, however, believe the industry has already anticipated these changes and is positioning itself accordingly. Companies have increasingly highlighted artificial intelligence initiatives during earnings calls and have begun reporting revenue linked to such offerings. In January, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. stated that its AI-led solutions are generating annualised revenue of about $1.8 billion, with growth of roughly 17 per cent on a quarter-on-quarter basis.Manu Rishi Guptha, a portfolio manager at MRG Capital, said investors may be overlooking two factors that could support Indian IT companies. According to Guptha, strong cash reserves can help firms navigate business model changes triggered by AI. Also, a relatively young workforce is capable of adapting quickly to tech shifts.Guptha added that the recent decline in share prices could represent an opportunity rather than a setback, noting that order inflows have remained steady while valuations have corrected. The Nifty IT index is currently trading at about 20 times forward earnings estimates, marking its lowest valuation level since April 2023.",The index tracking Indian IT sector stocks such as Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. and Infosys Ltd. has lost a massive $56 billion in market capitalization.

Infosys share soars 4% today! What's driving the stock price after major IT stocks selloff,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/infosys-share-soars-4-today-whats-driving-the-stock-price-after-major-it-stocks-selloff/articleshow/128454585.cms,"Infosys shares inched higher on Tuesday after the IT giant announced collaborating with Anthropic to develop enterprise-focused artificial intelligence solutions. The stock gained more than 4% during the session, touching a day’s high of Rs 1,430 on the BSE. At 1:24 pm, Infosys was trading at 1,417 on the NSE, up 51 points or 3.77%. On the Bombay Stock Exchange, the share was up 3.70% or 50 points to 1,416.The newly announced alliance is designed to build and deliver advanced AI solutions for enterprises operating in telecommunications, financial services, manufacturing and software development, according to ET. The first phase of the partnership will concentrate on the telecommunications industry, where a dedicated Anthropic Center of Excellence will be established to create and deploy AI agents built for sector-specific applications. The companies plan to subsequently extend the collaboration to other sectors, including financial services, manufacturing and software development.Focus of the partnership is integration of Anthropic’s Claude models, including Claude Code, with Infosys Topaz AI offerings. The combined platform is aimed towards help organisations automate complex workflows, accelerate software development cycles and adopt AI systems with the governance, oversight and transparency required in regulated industries.“Together, Infosys and Anthropic aim to help clients reimagine the enterprise operating model by combining deep industry expertise, frontier AI, and engineering scale into one unified approach,” Infosys said in a statement.A major area of emphasis will be agentic AI systems capable of independently executing multi-step tasks such as processing claims, generating and testing code, or conducting compliance reviews. Using tools such as the Claude Agent SDK, the collaboration will support the creation of AI agents that can operate persistently across extended and complex processes rather than handling isolated interactions.Salil Parekh, chief executive officer, Infosys, said, “Our collaboration with Anthropic marks a strategic leap toward advancing enterprise AI, enabling organisations to unlock value and become more intelligent, resilient, and responsible. From modernising financial services with intelligent risk management and compliance, to enabling engineering businesses to lead with AI-driven design and manufacturing, the goal is to leverage the joint expertise of Infosys and Anthropic to accelerate AI value realisation for global enterprises. ”The partnership will also focus on modernising legacy systems. By combining Infosys Topaz with Claude, organisations are expected to speed up migration initiatives and lower the cost of upgrading ageing infrastructure.","Infosys shares inched higher on Tuesday after IT giant announced collaborating with Anthropic to develop enterprise-focused artificial intelligence solutions.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Dangers Of AI: Is ChatGPT Quietly Harming Your Mental Health? | Global Pulse

Perplexity prioritise revenue over reach

Ads in ChatGPT

Perplexity, the AI search startup has made its stand clear that it will not put ads inside its chatbot answers. As reported by Business Insider, speaking at a roundtable with reporters this week, executives said that company is focused on subscription and enterprise sales and not on advertising. The stance aligns Perplexity more closely with Anthropic, which has also rejected ads, and sets it apart from OpenAI , which is leaning heavily into ad‑based monetization.Perplexity is ramping up its business sales strategy and is now targeting large organisations and high-powered users such as finance professionals, CEOs and doctors. The company presently just has five people on its enterprise sales team but it plans to expand aggressively. This positions Perplexity against rivals like Glean, which helps employees search internal files and data with AI.The report further adds that executives also mentioned that Perplexity will give prioritise revenue and retention over metrics like the number of questions answered. The company did not share the financial details but revealed that its revenue grew 4.7 times last year, hitting $200 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) by October 2025.The company also pledged to keep a free tier available, but with rare limits.The move comes amid Silicon Valley skepticism. At an AI conference last year, investors informally voted Perplexity the company they’d most like to bet against, citing concerns about the wider AI bubble. Still, Perplexity insists it has been “busy building” rather than chasing hype, and executives argue that ads in AI answers undermine trust.By siding with Anthropic’s philosophy and rejecting OpenAI’s ad‑driven approach, Perplexity is betting that trust and enterprise adoption will be stronger long‑term drivers of growth.Recently, OpenAI started testing ads in ChatGPT. The company said it has started testing ads in the AI tool in the United States and will apply only to logged-in adult users on the Free and Go plans. “We’re starting to roll out a test for ads in ChatGPT today to a subset of free and Go users in the U.S,” OpenAI said in an X post adding “Ads do not influence ChatGPT’s answers. Ads are labeled as sponsored and visually separate from the response. Our goal is to give everyone access to ChatGPT for free with fewer limits, while protecting the trust they place in it for important and personal tasks.”","Perplexity will not put ads inside its chatbot answers.

How UK’s new border rules work and who they hit hardest



UK’s new border rules discrimination claims: Legal and ethical debate



Real-world impact of UK’s new border rules: Families, journeys and identity



UK government rationale: Security or bureaucracy?



Where things stand now in the UK and what’s next







A highly controversial new United Kingdom border regime set to take effect on February 25, 2026 has drawn sharp criticism from rights activists, legal experts and campaign groups, who say it discriminates against women and dual nationals living abroad. The policy, introduced by the Home Office, requires all dual British nationals to enter the UK on a British passport or to obtain an expensive “certificate of entitlement” costing nearly £589 attached to their other passport, triggering widespread uproar and claims of unfair treatment.According to the rules, dual nationals who attempt to travel to Britain using only their non-British passport, even if they hold valid citizenship, may be refused boarding by airlines, ferries or international trains if they cannot present a British passport or the pricey certificate of entitlement. Critics have called the policy a “tourist denial machine” that effectively treats British citizens like foreign visitors unless they hold specific documentation. The Home Office has defended the change as part of broader border digitisation efforts aimed at enhancing security and streamlining entry processes, but campaigners insist the poor communication and logistical burden on affected travellers has exacerbated confusion and caused unnecessary distress.The essence of the reform is straightforward: from late February, dual British citizens will no longer be able to enter the UK on the passport of their other nationality alone. Under previous practice, many dual nationals for example, those holding both UK and Greek, Spanish, French, Australian or Canadian passports, could choose which passport to use when travelling. However, the upcoming rules mandate that carriers must verify right of abode using a UK passport or the costly certificate, meaning those without British passports risk being turned away at check-in.This has stirred significant anxiety among expatriate communities, particularly in countries like Spain and Greece where naming conventions differ from the UK format. In Greece, women who marry may legally retain a maiden name that doesn’t align with their UK passport because Greek law does not allow name changes upon marriage, while in Spain, formal documents typically include both paternal and maternal surnames, making them longer and structurally mismatched compared with British passports. Campaigners say this mismatch disproportionately affects women, since naming traditions in these countries often result in women’s documents diverging from UK passport naming standards.Julia Cross, a representative of grassroots group British in Greece, argued that many women have been unaware of the deadline and the specifics of the new requirements and that the name-alignment mandate unfairly targets them. “Many didn’t know they had to get a second passport,” Cross told media, adding that the name rules “only impact women” and can make straightforward travel unexpectedly harrowing. She and other activists have called for a three-month transition period and clearer communication from the government to alleviate what they describe as discriminatory effects.Campaigners and legal commentators have framed the debate not just as an administrative tweak but as a broader civil rights concern. Many argue that linking entry rights so tightly to a specific document disadvantages citizens who have no practical way to comply, particularly when their home country’s civil registry or passport laws make altering names complex, time-consuming or legally untenable. Women, whose names often change upon marriage or who come from cultures with distinct naming practices, find themselves in an awkward position: they must either secure a British passport on short notice or pay hefty fees to continue using their foreign documentation.Some advocates have gone further, warning that the rules could have a chilling effect on diaspora engagement with the UK. Dual nationals often travel to visit family, attend events or support aging relatives; having to navigate expensive certificates or renew passports can impose significant financial and bureaucratic barriers. One woman quoted by campaigners said she felt “effectively banned” from entering her own country because she could not produce the desired passport documentation, language that encapsulates the emotional and practical frustration many feel.Even outside of naming conflicts, the certification process itself has been criticised as onerous. At nearly £589, a sum comparable to or even exceeding some countries’ visa fees, the certificate is seen by some as an unfair tax on citizens, especially when it is required simply to board a plane or train to their own country. Critics note that while other nations like Canada or Australia require citizens to use national passports at entry, they do not impose such high costs, leaving the UK’s regime open to charges of being especially punitive and potentially discriminatory.The new rules have already triggered practical complications for British expatriates worldwide. As of early February, travel forums and reports lit up with accounts of families scrambling to secure British passports long before the deadline, sometimes facing delayed processing timelines due to high demand. Some dual nationals have even considered renouncing their British citizenship to avoid the bureaucratic headache of managing multiple passports and certificates, a drastic step given the cultural and personal identity implications of losing citizenship.Parents of children born overseas are particularly affected as without British passports for their kids, who might never have applied for one, families face the prospect of paying for certificates for each child or scrambling to renew or replace documents. These scenarios place emotional and financial stress on families keen to maintain ties with the UK while building lives abroad.Moreover, some expatriates face legal contradictions in countries where dual nationality is either not recognised or discouraged. For example, Spanish nationals cannot maintain citizenship of another state in certain circumstances, meaning that holding both passports can create legal ambiguity. In such cases, seeking a British passport may conflict with domestic laws or norms, adding another layer of complexity to already problematic requirements.The Home Office defends the border rules as part of a modernisation drive, aligned with broader rollout of the UK’s Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) system for visitors and enhanced digital checks at the border. Officials say that requiring dual nationals to present specific documentation ensures a “seamless travel experience” and gives authorities clearer information about who is entering the country, improving both security and immigration data quality.Supporters of the changes point out that many countries already require their own citizens travelling internationally to use national passports and airlines routinely enforce these rules. Some commentators on social media have echoed this, noting that similar requirements exist elsewhere and that the issue is more about communication and preparation, not systemic discrimination.Nonetheless, the intensity of reaction, especially from groups representing women impacted by naming mismatches, suggests that this is more than a debate over stainless administrative timelines. It is a discussion about citizenship, belonging, identity and equity in an increasingly digitised and document-focused travel world.As the enforcement date nears, dual nationals are scrambling to ensure compliance. Passport offices in many countries have seen increased application volumes and campaigners continue to press for transitional measures or targeted exemptions, particularly for women who genuinely cannot align names between multiple passports due to legal or cultural norms.Whether the UK government will offer more flexibility or whether legal challenges are forthcoming remains uncertain. However, what is clear is that this seemingly bureaucratic adjustment has ignited a much broader conversation about the meaning of citizenship, gender equity in travel law and how modern borders reconcile technical documentation with individual identity.From February 25, 2026, dual British citizens must present a British passport or a costly certificate of entitlement to enter the UK. Campaigners say that the policy disproportionately affects women, especially those from countries with different naming conventions like Greece and Spain. The certificate costs nearly £589 and critics call it discriminatory and poorly communicated. Families, expatriates and children born abroad are facing practical, emotional and financial challenges due to the rule change.The government insists the change is part of border modernisation and digital security upgrades. With millions of British nationals living overseas, from the EU and the Middle East to Australia and North America, this is not just a niche travel rule. It is reshaping how citizenship translates to freedom of movement in a post-Brexit world, sparking debate about national identity, fairness and borders in the 21st century.","UK’s new border regime set to take effect on February 25, 2026 has drawn sharp criticism from rights activists, legal experts and campaign groups. The policy, introduced by the Home Office, requires all dual British nationals to enter the UK on a British passport or to obtain an expensive “certificate of entitlement” costing nearly £589 attached to their other passport. Critics have called the policy a “tourist denial machine” that effectively treats British citizens like foreign visitors unless they hold specific documentation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128492123,imgsize-40368,width-400,resizemode-4/families-in-panic-as-uk-tightens-entry-rules-for-dual-passport-holders.jpg"

How Saudi Arabia’s Work Interruption Service works



If the worker has been in Saudi Arabia for less than two years, their contract can be terminated and they are required to exit the Kingdom within 60 days. Failure to do so breaches residency and labour laws.

If the worker has been in the Kingdom for more than two years, they have two options within 60 days: Transfer to a new employer or obtain a final exit visa and leave Saudi Arabia.

Background: Labour policy reforms in Saudi Arabia



Digital platforms like Musaned and Qiwa



Musaned, historically used for domestic worker recruitment and documentation, is now expanding into full employment lifecycle services.

Qiwa, another national platform, has already introduced reforms such as a 60-day grace period before reporting a worker as absent, giving them time to re-contract, transfer or exit the Kingdom legally.

Why Saudi Arabia’s Work Interruption Service matters: For employers and workers



For employers



Workers who disappear but remain legally in the country can create legal and logistical ambiguity.

Lack of formal procedures could lead to employers being unable to hire replacements quickly.

Unregulated exit or absence reports created disputes or misunderstandings.

For workers



A defined timeframe to regularise status rather than indefinite limbo.

Pathways to transfer employment rather than immediate repatriation in some cases.

In a significant labour-market update, Saudi Arabia ’s Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development has launched a new digital service that fundamentally changes how domestic worker contracts can be handled when a worker stops showing up for work. The launch, via the national unified recruitment platform Musaned, is part of broader labour reforms aimed at streamlining employment processes and increasing contractual clarity and compliance across the Kingdom.The Work Interruption Service, introduced in February 2026, is an online mechanism that allows individual employers to legally end the employment contract of a domestic worker when the employee has ceased reporting to work. This resolves long-standing legal and administrative ambiguities that both employers and workers have faced under the previous framework.Earlier, if a domestic worker disappeared or failed to show up for work (“huroob”), employers had limited formal options. They often had to wait for months or navigate complex administrative processes to terminate the contract, while workers remained in unclear legal situations, sometimes without clear rights or protections.The new service aims to solve this by providing structured, digital tools that are -The Musaned platform, which already facilitates domestic worker recruitment, visas and documentation, now also hosts this work interruption functionality — extending its role as the central digital hub for household employment governance.When a domestic worker stops reporting to work, the employer can file a termination request through Musaned. This is legally recognised and initiates a formal process that replaces older, informal practices. Once the request is submitted:These 60-day grace periods represent a significant and structured timeline to balance both employer needs and worker rights.Importantly, the Work Interruption Service also incorporates labour mobility features, meaning that workers whose contracts are terminated have a chance to change employers under regulated conditions. This is a notable shift from older norms where workers had little agency once their contract ended or if they left their employer, conditions often tied to the kafala sponsorship system that Saudi Arabia has been reforming for several years.This mobility component indicates that the new service is not just about terminating contracts, it is about ensuring workers are not left stranded without legal rights. It aligns with other regulatory updates that give workers a defined “grace period” to regularise their status or transfer sponsorship.The launch of the Work Interruption Service should be seen against the backdrop of broader labour-system modernisation efforts in Saudi Arabia. Over the past two years, the country has introduced several digital tools and regulatory updates to formalise employment relations:These platforms are part of a broader digital governance strategy that aims to reduce manual bureaucracy, enhance transparency, and digitise labour-market interactions.Before the Work Interruption Service, Saudi Arabia had initiatives such as grace periods on Musaned for workers reported as absent to regularise their status or transfer to new employers, a measure already reflecting a shift towards more humane and structured labour policy. The new Musaned service consolidates these efforts into a more robust system that formalises the termination process itself instead of only offering status correction options.Employers of domestic staff, often families or private households, have historically faced challenges with contractual enforcement:With the Work Interruption Service, employers get a clear legal path to contract termination, reducing risk and confusion. This also benefits the domestic help sector by providing predictable standards for resolving conflicts, something that had been lacking in many informal arrangements.For domestic workers, especially expatriates from abroad, this reform provides:By formalising the process, the system aims to protect vulnerable workers from arbitrary or unfair treatment while still balancing employer needs. Domestic work has often operated in grey zones, with informal contracts or undocumented changes. By codifying termination and mobility processes digitally via Musaned, Saudi Arabia is pushing the sector towards formal labour governance, similar to reforms in the private sector that emphasise digital documentation and lawful compliance.While Saudi Arabia does not fully operate under international labour frameworks, these reforms bring its system closer to globally recognised best practices by ensuring:The Work Interruption Service gives employers a legal, digital way to terminate contracts when domestic workers stop showing up. It includes a grace period (usually 60 days), giving workers options to transfer sponsorship or exit the country legally. This system is part of broader Saudi labour reforms focusing on digital governance and contractual clarity. Workers and employers alike benefit from greater transparency and defined timelines. It complements other reforms like Qiwa’s grace periods and Musaned’s recruitment enhancements.Saudi Arabia’s Work Interruption Service represents a notable shift in how the Kingdom manages domestic employment relations, moving from largely manual, informal arrangements to structured, transparent, digital processes. It reflects ongoing efforts to modernise labour governance, protect rights on both sides and integrate labour-market activity into unified digital platforms like Musaned and Qiwa.Whether you are an employer seeking clarity in contractual enforcement or a domestic worker looking for secure legal pathways to navigate employment changes, this reform marks an important milestone in Saudi Arabia’s labour policy evolution.","Saudi Arabia ’s Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development has launched a new digital service that fundamentally changes how domestic worker contracts can be handled.
