3 Coast Guard men killed as helicopter crashes in Gujarat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/3-coast-guard-men-killed-as-helicopter-crashes-in-gujarat/articleshow/116973887.cms,"NEW DELHI: Three Coast Guard personnel were killed after their 'Dhruv' advanced light helicopter (ALH) crashed at Porbandar in Gujarat on Sunday afternoon, raising questions once again about the indigenous twin-engine choppers that have been grounded a few times after a string of accidents earlier.The ALH Mark-III chopper was returning from a routine training sortie when it reportedly developed some technical snag while landing at the Coast Guard Air Enclave in Porbandar, and crashed at about 12.15 pm. The two pilots - Commandant Saurabh and Deputy Commandant S K Yadav - and air crew diver Manoj Pradhan Navik were pulled out of the burning helicopter and rushed to the govt hospital. ""But they succumbed to their injuries. A board of inquiry will investigate the reasons leading to the crash,"" an official said.The incident comes after another ALH of the Coast Guard crashed into the Arabian Sea during a medical evacuation operation in Sept last year, leading to the death of the two pilots and an aircrew diver. The entire fleet of around 330 ALHs in the armed forces were grounded a few times in 2023 after four major accidents.The helicopter-manufacturer defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) had then undertaken safety technical upgrades after cases of design and metallurgical flaws, including ""failure of the collective"", which controls the power to the rotors and back, were reported in the choppers.First, a weaponised ALH version called Rudra had crashed in Arunachal Pradesh in Oct 2022, killing two officers and three soldiers. Then, there were two back-to-back ALH crashes in March 2023. In May that year, another ALH Mark-III of the Army had gone down in J&K's Kishtwar district, killing a soldier and grievously injuring the two pilots.The crashes had led to calls for a comprehensive inquiry into the problems plaguing the chopper fleet because the ALHs are the workhorses of the armed forces and critical in the ongoing push for self-reliance in defence production. Moreover, India also wants to export the 5.5-tonne chopper in greater numbers in the years ahead.",The ALH Mark-III chopper was returning from a routine training sortie. It reportedly developed some technical snag while landing at the Coast Guard Air Enclave in Porbandar.

Graffiti in ancient Tamil Nadu sites similar to Indus Valley civilisation signs: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/graffiti-in-ancient-tamil-nadu-sites-similar-to-indus-valley-civilisation-signs-study/articleshow/116973837.cms,"CHENNAI: A study by the Tamil Nadu archaeology department has revealed that more than 90% of the ancient graffiti marks found at 140 archaeological sites in the state, including Keeladi, have parallels or similarities with those of the Indus Valley civilisation that existed from around 3300 BCE to 1300 BCE.Researchers analyzed 15,184 graffiti signs inscribed on potsherds unearthed from these sites, discovering that some signs had exact parallels while others had near similarities. ""The exact shapes and their variants found in south India and Indus scripts indicate that they were not accidental,"" said archaeologist K Rajan, one of the report's authors. He said the Indus script or signs likely evolved over time rather than disappearing without a trace.The study highlighted several common symbols between southern India and Indus Valley (also known as the Harappan civilisation), including upward-facing arrows with triangle or flower-shaped heads, fish signs in both stylish and exact forms, U- shaped signs, plain circles, ladder symbols, square boxes (plain and divided), X-shaped signs, and swastika-like signs in both clockwise and anti-clockwise forms.Other common marks included flower signs, inverted Y-like signs, Z-like signs, A-like signs, and star signs.""The recent radiocarbon dates indicate that when the Indus Valley experienced the Copper Age, south India was in the Iron Age. In this sense, the Iron Age of south India and the Copper Age of the Indus were contemporary. If they are contemporary, there is a possibility of cultural exchanges either through direct or intermediate zones,"" Rajan said.Excavations at sites like Sivagalai, Adhichanallur, and other locations in Tamiraparani river basin have provided recent iron dating that may push back the timeline of the Iron Age in southern India by several centuries. Rajan highlighted the importance of documenting the graffiti inscribed potsherds, saying this documentation would be made available to researchers for further deciphering.Archaeology department joint director R Sivanantham, who is a co-author of the report, said: ""The occurrence of a large number of carnelian and agate beads, as well as high-tin bronze objects, particularly from Iron Age graves, gives a clue about the contacts as carnelian, agate, copper, and tin have to come from the north.""","Researchers analyzed 15,184 graffiti signs inscribed on potsherds unearthed from these sites.

Some flyers lost their cool after patiently sitting in the aircraft for more than two hours.""The cabin crew told the passengers to be seated, assuring them that the plane would be in the air soon. ""But it never happened. Many passengers, mostly senior citizens, wanted to go back to the terminal building to sit and rest comfortably. But that was not to be.

But there was no logic behind keeping us seated in the plane for more than seven hours,"" he said.""The cabin crew members suddenly told us to deboard the plane at 5.30am on Saturday, stating that there was a technical problem in the aircraft. After coming out of the plane, we were huddled into buses. The vehicles moved around the area for a while and dropped us at the terminal building. Then we were told to go through the security check again. The whole thing took around two hours.

Poll What Do You Think Was Captain Devi Sharan's Greatest Achievement? His Overall Dedication to Aviation Handling IC 814 Situation

NEW DELHI: “Now even as a passenger, I will always be looking at people around me to ensure that everyone is alright and nothing’s wrong. A creeping doubt will linger on.” That’s how Captain Devi Sharan — commander of the Indian Airlines aircraft IC 814 hijacked in December 1999 — will travel hereon after operating his last flight as a pilot on Saturday and retiring on turning 65. Joining erstwhile Indian Airlines in 1985, the ace pilot hung up his boots after 40 years in the flight deck that have given him memories — and nightmares — for a lifetime.“IC 814 hijacking taught me life is very unpredictable and one has to be always ready to fight back. Those were the toughest days of my life and my only aim was to save lives of everyone on that aircraft. I hope and pray no crew member, passenger or anyone else ever relives those moments,” Sharan told TOI Sunday as he prepares to board a set of long flights around the world over the next one year that will take him to Antartica and Siberia among other places.The Kandahar hijacking was not the only time this pilot and some others in erstwhile Indian Airlines had a tryst with danger. He along with Captain S P S Suri — the pilot flew the hijacked aircraft of erstwhile Indian Airlines back home on January 1, 2000, — had another tryst with danger 12 years later. This time the two and their cabin crew member colleagues got stuck in civil-war torn Libya and were waylaid by AK 47-totting youngsters on the streets of the city. Luckily, they all escaped unhurt.Captain Sharan did his flying training from Karnal in 1984 and then was selected by erstwhile Indian Airlines (which merged into Air India in 2007) the next year. He started with the Boeing 737-200, then operated the Airbus A320 and the A330 (one of which was hijacked to Kandahar). After the merger with AI, he flew the A330 and then the B787 Dreamliner. His final flight as a pilot was operating a Dreamliner from Melbourne to Delhi on January 4. The crew of this flight gave hi a special farewell.“With the same enthusiasm of a young boy who once joined this airline, I now turn the page and embark on the golden years of my life,” he said in a mail to colleagues. After his year-long world tour is over, Captain Sharan plans to do farming in Karnal and may also be onboard the mega training facility AI is creating.","Captain Devi Sharan, commander of IC 814 hijacked in 1999, retires after 40 years in the flight deck.

The ship, dating back to the 17th or 18th centuries, includes a cannon and anchor, suggesting historic maritime battles.

Poll Which Destination Would you Prefer for a Tropical Getaway? Lakshadweep Andaman and Nicobar Islands

CHENNAI: A group of divers exploring marine life near Kalpeni island in the Lakshadweep archipelago stumbled on Saturday morning upon the wreck of what, it appeared, had been a warship.Going by the nature of the wreck, researchers believe the ship, fitted with cannon, might have belonged to any of the three European powers - Portuguese, Dutch, or British - and was sunk sometime during the fight for supremacy over the ancient maritime route connecting the Middle East and Sri Lanka in the 17th and 18th centuries.“When we spotted the wreck on the western side of Kalpeni, we didn’t know it was a warship. When we found a cannon and an anchor, we realised it could be an important find,” said Satyajeet Mane, a marine explorer who led the group of divers from Brannadives, a local divers’ group that included Nasrulla and Sajudheen.They said they would inform the local authorities about the find. ""We found it at a depth of just four or five metres at the mouth of a lagoon. The wreckage appears to be spread over the deeper parts of the Arabian Sea,"" said Mane. ""Going by the size of the ship, the cannon, and the metal, it could be a European warship. More exploration is needed.""Idrees Babu, a scientist at the department of science and technology and a mentor to the divers' group, said such a shipwreck has not been recorded in the region earlier. tnn""The ship might have been 50m-60m in length. The East India Company started using iron ships on this trade route in the 17th century or 18th century. We need underwater archaeological studies to learn more about it; till then we need to protect the site,"" he said.When the British used iron ships, the Portuguese continued to use ships made of iron and wood. ""The coral growth on the wreckage and corrosion makes it difficult to immediately ascertain if the ship was made fully of iron or it had components of wood too. The coral growth indicates it has been submerged for a few centuries,"" said Mane.","Divers discover wreck of probable European warship near Kalpeni island, Lakshadweep.

'No Australia-like plan in India to ban social media for kids': IT secretary S Krishnan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-australia-like-plan-in-india-to-ban-social-media-for-kids-it-secretary-s-krishnan/articleshow/116973271.cms,"In the draft rules under DPDP law, you have suggested ""verifiable consent"" of parents when children join social media, against going the Australia way which has announced a complete ban for those under age of 16. Was a ban ever considered?

So, there is no plan of a complete ban?

The govt has time and again expressed frustration in dealing with the Big Tech and how open - or prompt - they are to requests and orders around content takedown. Is the compliance getting worse or getting better?

Cyber frauds have emerged as a major concern, with people losing thousands of crores of rupees and new phenomenon like digital arrests emerging in today's day and age. How concerned are you?

Govt has suggested “verifiable consent” from parents through the draft digital personal data protection rules against going out for an all-out ban on children joining social media on the lines of Australia, IT secretary S Krishnan told Pankaj Doval in an interview.“These are things which every society has to decide for itself. And so that is a social thing as to whether you will restrict access completely. In the Indian context, a lot of learning also takes place online. So, if you block complete access, is that a good way? That’s a broader social debate.”On social media firms taking out unlawful content, Krishnan praised Big Tech: “Compliance is actually going up tremendously, and many, many cases are dealt with before it even comes to the question of blocking. They do it immediately. Based on their own community guidelines or the takedown requests given out by the govt over unlawful content, the timeframe within which they do it now is really short… it’s gone up remarkably.”These are things which every society has to decide for itself. And so that is a social thing as to whether you will restrict access completely. In the Indian context, a lot of learning also takes place online. So, if you block complete access, is that a good way? That's a broader social debate. We control only the technology of it, but who should have access and how, that is something which is where the society at large has to have some sort of a consensus and the govt then needs to take it up and move forward.I don't think anyone has even suggested that so far. As far as a ban is concerned, I don't think that's even been discussed. I mean there are issues on how you prevent harm (to children) and what measures can be taken to prevent harm. But, that's not gone to the extent of a complete ban.Compliance is actually going up tremendously, and many, many cases are dealt with before it even comes to the question of blocking. They do it immediately. Based on their own community guidelines or the takedown requests given out by the govt over unlawful content, the timeframe within which they do it now is really short than earlier.And compared to where it was, say two or three years ago, it's gone up remarkably. The number of things which are taken down, the timeliness with which they're taken down, has gone up remarkably. These are on issues such as CSAM (child sexual abuse material), offensive content of various kinds, and on something that may disturb communal harmony. They do act, and on time.We are very concerned. First of all, let me emphasise that there is nothing called a cyber arrest. There is no provision for a cyber arrest or a digital arrest in any Indian law. People, including the educated, are falling for it due to a lack of awareness. Even the PM has spoken about this issue, which reflects the importance we are giving to this new problem.Not just the IT ministry, but there are a plethora of agencies involved in cyber security, which includes the ministry of home affairs and the i4C (India Cybercrime Coordination Centre), apart from the office of the National Security Advisor to address these problems.","Govt has suggested “verifiable consent” from parents through the draft digital personal data protection rules.

Recently, a 49-year-old man from Kandivli, following a call, received a link that led to documents related to a money laundering ""charge"" against him. The link resembled Supreme Court's website. Alarmed, he transferred Rs 32 lakh to scammers, later realising that the documents were fake. The cyber police registered an FIR on Jan 1. In another digital detention case, a vice-president with a private company was scammed of Rs 1.6 crore.This is how the scam unfolded. The Kandivli man received a call last month, with the caller claiming to be a Trai employee. The caller said a case had been registered against the man with Delhi Police for money laundering and for putting out fake ads. The call was transferred to ""DCP Sharma"" who instructed the man to get onto a WhatsApp call. On it, the man shared information on his assets and investments, besides personal information such as where he worked. He was told to provide information on his whereabouts every hour.The next day, ""CBI officer Simi"" contacted him and sent him a web link about the ""charges"" he faced. He was also given a ""case number"". Once he keyed it in, an arrest warrant, a bank account freeze warrant and an RBI notice popped up. They were all fake, but the man was convinced he was in legal trouble. The scammers forbade him from seeking advice from anyone. After receiving a second notice with ""Supreme Court of India"" written on the letterhead, the man was spooked and went to the bank as instructed by the scammers. He transferred Rs 32 lakh to them. After returning home and confiding in his family, his brother told him it appeared that he had been scammed.In the case of the vice-president, fraudsters got him to empty out not only his bank accounts, but also the pension accounts of his elderly mother and deceased father. They sent him letters from ""CBI, RBI and Supreme Court"", accusing him of drug trafficking, human trafficking and money laundering. He was asked to download Skype where instructions were given to him to transfer funds to ""a special account created by RBI"". Faced with threats that his mother too would be arrested, he transferred Rs 1.6 crore. While he was making the final money transfer from the Bengaluru airport, his friend told him it looked like he had been scammed.","A 49-year-old man from Kandivli, following a call, received a link that led to documents related to a money laundering ""charge"" against him.

102 maps forged to legalise Mumbai coast properties: Probe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/102-maps-forged-to-legalise-mumbai-coast-properties-probe/articleshow/116972854.cms,"MUMBAI: A special investigation team (SIT) formed following a Bombay high court order has said it has unearthed a land scam involving large-scale tampering of property records to convert Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) and No Development Zone (NDZ) lands into developable plots along the Mumbai coastline. Four people including two former govt employees were arrested last week for the scam linked to at least 102 property maps along the coast. In all, 18 govt staff from BMC and land records section have been summoned for questioning.The scam allegedly involves estate agents, govt staff and contractors who altered land records in Marve, Madh Island, Versova and other ecologically sensitive spots. The manipulation was first flagged by a farmer from Erangal in Malad, Vaibhav Thakur, who owns ancestral farm land. He had an FIR registered at Goregaon police station in 2021 against illegal constructions on his plot and adjoining lands. Thakur found that govt records had been forged to classify CRZ and NDZ plots as developable zones. However, authorities including BMC and Goregaon police failed to make much headway.Subsequently, deputy superintendent of land records Nitin Salunkhe lodged another FIR in 2021. He said maps and documents were forged between 2012 and 2020 to regularise illegal constructions in eco-sensitive zones. The matter resonated in the assembly in 2022 and prompted govt to set up an inquiry committee. The committee's findings were presented in HC when the original complainant, Thakur, filed a plea alleging inaction despite govt findings.The SIT set up on HC's order in Oct 2024 was tasked with probing four FIRs in all. Led by joint commissioner of police (crime) Lakhmi Gautam, it has made four arrests. According to the SIT, the four accused in connivance with govt staff manipulated 102 property maps and records over the years by adding false details, such as fabricated City Survey numbers, non-existent constructions, and altered boundaries. Forged maps were distributed under the guise of filing RTI requests. BMC officials allegedly approved the constructions and sale based on these fraudulent documents, leading to significant ecological damage and revenue loss to the govt.Investigators found that of 884 permanent enumeration maps dating back to 1955-1984 and housed in the deputy superintendent's office, 102 were fraudulent, showing constructions that did not exist before 1964. Maharashtra govt, following the SIT's findings, has ordered the principal secretary of Urban Development and Director of Land Records in Pune to take action against those responsible for manipulating public records. The SIT has seized all 884 original maps and their digital copies from the Maharashtra Remote Sensing Application Centre in Nagpur. Further investigations will focus on identifying additional suspects and verifying the authenticity of all documents.Last Thursday, the SIT arrested contractor Narshim Puttawallu (50), who is an accused in all four FIRs, along with two retired officers from the City Survey Office identified as Devdas Jadhav and Marade, and real estate agent Imam Shaikh. They were booked for forging records in connivance with officers from BMC and the Land Records Department. ""Illegal construction on CRZ and NDZ lands have severely impacted ecological balance and caused huge revenue loss. A total of 18 officials from BMC and Land Records Department have been summoned for questioning but due to the election process investigations were delayed,'' said a senior police official.","The scam allegedly involves estate agents, govt staff and contractors who altered land records in Marve, Madh Island, Versova and other ecologically sensitive spots.

Kerala Nurse Death: Iran offers help to Kerala nurse on Yemen death row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iran-offers-help-to-kerala-nurse-on-yemen-death-row/articleshow/116898420.cms,"A senior Iranian official said Thursday that Tehran was ready to take up the case of Nimisha Priya , a nurse from Kerala sentenced to death in Yemen for the murder of a Yemeni national. ""We are ready to do whatever we can as it involves a humanitarian issue,"" said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. Iran-backed Houthi rebels remain in control of large parts of Yemen, including capital Sanaa.After the Yemen president last month upheld the death sentence of Nimisha, in jail since 2017, India said it was in touch with her family members and was extending all possible help to them in exploring legal options.Iran's offer of help came ahead of another round of foreign office consultations with India in which Tehran is expected to call for revival of trade ties, including resumption of oil supplies to India. Unlike with Iran, India has not just continued to import crude from Russia despite international sanctions but also ramped up Russian supplies.The official also spoke about bilateral ties with India and the need to explore opportunities to enhance trade ties, despite the sanctions Iran is facing. ""We don't want to impose any hardship on India but there are opportunities that can be explored. The nature of sanctions against Iran and Russia are different but it's still a legitimate question why India has continued to import energy from Russia but not Iran. We need to see how this issue can be addressed,"" said the official.Speaking about the conflict in Gaza and the overall West Asia situation, the official said Israel's military actions in Gaza had only worked to further ""internationalise'' the Palestine issue. ""The core issue is the occupation of Palestine and it must be addressed. We want to see an independent Palestine state. Nobody can erase it from the global agenda,"" said the official, who also backed stronger counter-terrorism cooperation with India in the context of recent developments in Syria.Also read: 'Last-min pardon' the hope for kin of nurse on Yemen death row","Iran is ready to take up the case of Nimisha Priya, a nurse from Kerala sentenced to death in Yemen for the murder of a Yemeni national.

The file was then sent to the PPSC for concurrence, as part of the laid-down procedure.The dismissal order on Thursday noted that the PPSC concurred with the proposal of the state govt on Dec 26 and granted approval to dismiss Sandhu from govt service under Article 311(2)(b) of the Constitution.The order pointed out that the proviso in question under the Article implemented in the present case as it was “not reasonably practicable” to hold an inquiry into the chargesheet issued to Gursher Singh Sandhu in view of the “non-cooperative attitude of the officer.”Referring to the inquiry by a special investigation team (SIT) constituted by the high court, the order said that Sandhu, who was under suspension since Oct 25, “facilitated the recording of an interview of Lawrence Bishnoi by a TV channel, while he was in the custody of CIA, Kharar.”The dismissal order noted that the Punjab DGP apprised that Sandhu “evaded all attempts to receive the chargesheet,” which had to be “affixed at the doorstep of his residence as a means of ensuring formal service in compliance with procedural requirements.”Two back-to-back TV interviews of gangster Lawrence Bishnoi were telecast by a channel in March 2023. The SIT headed by special DGP (Punjab State Human Rights Commission) Prabodh Kumar pointed out that while one interview was conducted when Bishnoi was in CIA, Kharar, the second interview was conducted in Rajasthan.Consequent to the SIT findings, seven police officials, including Sandhu, were suspended by the Punjab government. The Punjab vigilance bureau is also conducting a disproportionate assets probe against Sandhu.","The Punjab government on Thursday dismissed deputy superintendent of police Gursher Singh Sandhu from service.

'Chacha will be voted out'



NEW DELHI: Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav on Wednesday said he was ready to ""forgive and welcome"" Bihar CM Nitish Kumar to the opposition INDIA boc.""Our doors are open (for Nitish). He should also unbolt his gates. This would facilitate movement of people from both sides,"" Lalu Yadav said.Reacting to the RJD chief's remark, CM Nitish Kumar gave no affirmative response.""Kya bol rahe hain (What are you saying)"" was all the JD(U) boss said in response to queries from journalists about Prasad's fresh offer, according to news agency PTI.Meanwhile, former JD(U) president Rajiv Ranjan Singh ""Lalan"" snapped when asked about Lalu Yadav's remark.""The NDA is strong. JD(U) and BJP are united. It is a free society and anybody can say whatever he pleases. It is for Lalu ji to say more on his own utterances"", Lalan Singh said.Nitish Kumar, who ditched the INDIA bloc after spearheading its formation last year, joined the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) ahead of the Lok Sabha polls.With the switch, though Nitish managed to remain the CM, RJD leader and Lalu's son Tejashwi Yadav had to step down as his deputy.Just hours after he resigned, the Janata Dal (United) chief took oath as the chief minister for a record ninth time.Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis also took a dig at Lalu Yadav, saying his ""dream will always remain dreams (Mungeri Lal ke Haseen Sapne hi rahenge). They will never be fulfilled.""Things seemed to fare smoothly for the NDA until the opposition got a shot in the arms after the Lok Sabha poll results.In the parliamentary election, BJP missed out on the majority numbers as it won only 240 seats, 32 less than the halfway mark.Whereas, the JDU won 12 seats in the Lok Sabha elections and emerged as a key ally in the NDA, positioning Nitish Kumar as a crucial player in the ruling alliance.The BJP-led NDA at the Centre majorly hinges on the JDU and Andhra Pradesh CM Chandrababu Naidu's TDP, which won 16 seats for the ruling coalition to cross the majority figure of the 272 seats.If the table turns in Bihar, the INDIA bloc with 235 seats, would have a direct advantage of an additional 12 seats, an opportunity that the opposition has been eying since June 4 results.Unlike his father, Tejaswi Yadav was a little hard-hitting with his remark as he claimed that the new year will mark the ""departure"" of the CM Nitish-led NDA government in Bihar.Tejashwi Yadav, who is now leader of the opposition, was talking to reporters shortly after governor designate Arif Mohammad Khan left his house in Patna.""It is too cold. Keep yourselves warm but do not make any wild guesses. The new year will see a new harvest (nai fasal) and a new government that will be sensitive to the people's need for health, education and jobs (padhaai, kamaai, dawaai, sunwai aur karvaayi ki sarkaar),"" the RJD leader was quoted as saying by PTI.He added: ""In the new year, my uncle (chacha) Nitish Kumar will be voted out. He has been in power for 20 years. Soil gets ruined if the same crop is sown for so long. So, it is time for the departure of Nitish ji and the NDA.""","Lalu Prasad Yadav says he is ready to ""forgive and welcome"" Bihar CM Nitish Kumar to the opposition INDIA boc.

Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has publicly criticized Elon Musk 's defense of the H-1B visa program , reigniting a debate over its impact on the US job market. In a statement released Thursday, Sanders took issue with Musk’s support for the foreign visa system, arguing that it enables companies to hire low-wage foreign workers instead of providing well-paying jobs for Americans.“Elon Musk is wrong,” Sanders wrote in a post on Musk's platform, X. “The main function of the H-1B visa program is not to hire ‘the best and the brightest,’ but rather to replace good-paying American jobs with low-wage indentured servants from abroad. The cheaper the labor they hire, the more money the billionaires make.”This bold assertion drew a sharp response from Anil, an Indian-American cardiologist trained at the Mayo Clinic, who shared his personal experience to counter Sanders' claims. “Senator, I am a cardiologist trained at Mayo Clinic. Without the H-1B visa, my path to US citizenship would have been impossible,” Anil wrote. “Before hiring me, my employer struggled for over a year to find a qualified, well-trained cardiologist to serve rural Kansas. I’d be happy to meet with you to provide a clearer picture of how the H-1B program supports underserved communities and strengthens our nation.”Another user wrote, “The H-1B program can indeed be misused, but it’s essential for addressing skill shortages in the US The real issue isn’t the program itself but ensuring fair wages and treatment for all workers.”Musk, who has long been a vocal supporter of the H-1B program, has argued that there is a shortage of skilled tech workers in the US and that foreign talent is necessary to fill the gaps. He has aligned himself with former President Donald Trump on the issue, with both men advocating for the hiring of individuals from countries like India to boost technological innovation in the US.Sanders, however, remained critical of Musk’s stance, citing recent layoffs at Tesla as evidence that the reliance on foreign guest workers may be harming American workers. “If there is really a shortage of skilled tech workers in America, why did Tesla lay off over 7,500 American workers this year— including many software developers and engineers at its factory in Austin, Texas—while being approved to employ thousands of H-1B guest workers?” Sanders questioned.The Vermont senator, known for his progressive views on labor rights, also used the debate to highlight his proposed minimum wage increase , which remains at $7.25 per hour. Sanders argued that the issue of foreign labor should not overshadow the need for higher wages for American workers. “Bottom line,” he wrote, “It should never be cheaper for a corporation to hire a guest worker from overseas than an American worker.”While Sanders and Musk continue to spar over the future of the H-1B visa program, the debate has also drawn attention to the role of Indian professionals in the US labor force. Many Indian-American workers , especially in the tech and healthcare sectors, rely on the H-1B visa to pursue careers in the US and contribute to the economy.As the conversation around the H-1B visa intensifies, both sides of the debate remain at odds over the program's impact on American jobs and wages. For now, the question remains whether the program’s benefits to the US economy and underserved communities outweigh the concerns voiced by critics like Sanders.","Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has publicly criticized Elon Musk's defense of the H-1B visa program.

I believe in building programs. I believe in developing young players.

I think we have a very good foundation here.""McCarthy's 174 wins are 13th all time in NFL history.""I don't like to talk about myself that way, but I'll just be clear: I'm a winner. I know how to win,"" he said. ""I've won a championship. I won a championship in this building, and that's who I am.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.
