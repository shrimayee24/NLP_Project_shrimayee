"Rahul writes to President over 'discriminatory' Agnipath scheme, urges her to intervene",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rahul-writes-to-president-over-discriminatory-agnipath-scheme-urges-her-to-intervene/articleshow/110628480.cms,"(File Photo)

NEW DELHI: Congress’ Rahul Gandhi has written to President Droupadi Murmu against Agnipath scheme , alleging that there was discrimination in the nature and extent of benefits given to families of slain Agniveers. Rahul urged the president to intervene as she is the supreme commander of the armed forces and the issue affects national security.

“There can be no clearer illustration of the fundamental flaw in Agnipath scheme — the creation of a ‘lesser’ cadre of soldiers who are expected to work on similar tasks with lower pay, benefits and prospects,” Rahul said in the letter.

“Discrimination in the nature and extent of benefits accorded to the families of our slain Agniveers, compared to regular soldiers warrants your urgent attention. This ‘anyaay’ is why Congress and our INDIA allies have strongly opposed Agnipath scheme, and have promised to repeal it if we form govt,” the former Congress chief said.

Rahul requested President Murmu to intervene even though he recognised that a president did not generally interfere in policy matters, which are the domain of the elected govt. “However, I believe an exception is warranted in this case, given both the seriousness of this issue and your unique position. You are the supreme commander of India’s armed forces. You have taken an oath to devote yourself to well being of people of India,” he said.

“I appeal to you to use your distinguished office to do ‘nyay’ to Agniveer soldiers who lay down their lives, by ensuring that they receive the same benefits as any soldier who makes the highest sacrifice for our motherland,” Rahul said.

"Soil poses threat to turtles’ hatchlings amid rising mercury, say experts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/soil-poses-threat-to-turtles-hatchlings-amid-rising-mercury-say-experts/articleshow/110627443.cms,"PILIBHIT : The ongoing heatwave, that has affected almost every part of the country, has posed a great threat to hatchlings of turtles during their journey from the hatching spot to rivers and reservoirs. While riversides are feared to scorch the feet of hatchlings, they are also restraining the turtles from foraging as most freshwater turtle species come out of water only in abundance of moisture along the riverside and at the banks of reservoirs.The director of Turtle Survival Alliance India Foundation (TSA), Sahilendra Singh, said turtle species are currently hatching of eggs after laying of eggs was completed in March-April. “As the incubation period, that spans between 45 and 75 days in terms of different turtle species, is likely to mature within the next few days, the hatchlings, following their inborn characteristics, will start moving rapidly towards water bodies without the escort of the mother turtle soon after coming out of the eggs. In such a situation, the blistering soil surface may cause irreparable damage to their feet,” Singh said.Pilibhit is home to 13 turtle species of which 11 have been enlisted in Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act. In addition, most carry the status of endangered and critically endangered as per the red list of International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).“The district is nestled within the Terai Arc Land (TAL) near Himalayan foothills on the Indo-Nepal border comprises over 600 small wetlands, 10 rivers and some giant reservoirs. Most importantly, the river Devha, Sharda and their tributaries which meander frequently during the monsoon every year, form several temporary alluvial islands with thick layers of filamentous benthic algae. This feature significantly contributes to the varied turtle fauna in the area,” Singh added.Earlier, the State Wetland Authority (SWA) in UP had identified 303 wetlands in Pilibhit in 2019 stretched in over 2.5 hectares each. For precise results, SWA authorities had applied advanced satellite and remote sensing technology during the identification, said forest officials.“The hot surface of soil near rivers and reservoirs may result in desiccation of tiny turtles’ eggs like Indian eyed turtle which is the smallest in all turtle species identified so far in UP. This turtle excavates a very shallow pit to lay merely 2-3 eggs and lack of moisture due to the extreme heat wave can damage the eggs,” said Shriparna Dutta, a turtle expert associated with TSA.“The medium-sized turtle species like spotted pond turtle, lays 13-39 eggs while the big species like Indian soft shell turtles produce 18-22 eggs”, she added.The divisional forest officer of Pilibhit tiger reserve, Manish Singh, said forest personnel were striving hard to maintain the minimal level of water in the reserve’s water bodies. The efforts to restore water flow in the dried-up part of river Mala were also on a war-footing. “For rejuvenation and widening of this river, which is home to many scheduled species of turtles, a comprehensive plan has recently been sent to the state administration,” he said.",The heatwave has posed a great threat to hatchlings of turtles during their journey from the hatching spot to rivers and reservoirs.

Source: Paper titled Review of WHO Growth Standards and their Relevance for India

The move to use locally developed yardsticks for measuring the extent of undernutrition among Indian children and adolescents has moved a step further with a group of researchers publishing a paper in the journal Indian Paediatrics arguing for such a change.Disappointed that even India’s ‘healthy’ children and adolescents show not enough progress when measured against the WHO growth standards for children, the researchers recommend ditching these standards and adopting locally developed “growth references”. If adopted, they would immediately reduce the proportion of children who are underweight or stunted or wasted substantially.Critics of the move, however, argue that references are not the same as standards. Growth standards show how children ought to grow under conditions likely to favour them achieving their full growth potential. References, on the other hand, describe how children actually grew at a given time and place. The WHO study was meant for setting prescriptive standards and not references, they point out.The researchers pushing for using references instead of the WHO standards, expressed concern that survey after survey was not showing enough progress in reducing prevalence of undernutrition among children under five years in India. Their paper stated that one reason could be “the use of the one-size-fits-all WHO Child Growth Standards”.The authors of the paper have tried to create an alternative to using WHO standards by measuring the distributions of height-for-age for children up to 19 years, weight-for-age for children up to 9 years, weight-for-height for children less than 5 years and body mass index (BMI) for 5-19 year olds. They extracted data of ‘healthy’ children in the top quintiles from four Indian surveys over the last two decades -- three national family health surveys (NFHS) 2004-05, 2014-15 and 2019-21 and the comprehensive national nutrition survey (CNNS) 2016-18.Several public health and nutrition experts pointed out that the top quintile would mean the top 20% and that such a large socioeconomic stratum of the Indian population could not be without any deprivation even if you removed those with chronic illness, acute febrile or infectious illness, ongoing fever etc. In contrast, the WHO standards used a sample from the top 1% of the Indian population that could provide a child an environment free from constraints for its growth to full potential. The authors talk of the children in their sample being “more representative of the national population”. But experts point out that standard setting is not about representing a population and added that the authors were repeatedly conflating standards and references.While the paper seem to suggest that the reason for poor progress could be because the standards are not applicable to India, latest National Family Health Survey (2019-21) data shows poor progress on the underlying determinants of child stunting such as women with 10 years or more of schooling (improved from 35.7% to 41%), girls married before the age of 18 years (reduced from 26.8% to 23.3%) and proportion of children aged 6 months to 2 years who received an “adequate diet” (9.6% to 11%) as recommended by the WHO. Moreover, with the same WHO standards, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Bhutan have shown marked reduction in stunting rates compared to India. Even within India, many states have shown remarkable progress when measured against these standards.Source: Paper titled Review of WHO Growth Standards and their Relevance for India“It would be unfortunate if India decides to reduce its aspirations for its children just because the government is unable to show as much progress on these indices as it would like to,” said a public health expert.The study to develop the WHO standards included a sample from India which was drawn from affluent families in South Delhi who met all the stringent criteria that constituted “favourable environment for growth” including mothers’ willingness to follow the study’s feeding recommendations. “That such a sample had socio-economic characteristics which are comparable to a very small proportion of the Indian population, probably within the top 1%, is probably a reflection of the high levels of inequality in the country,” stated a recent review of the WHO standards and its relevance for India.“Stunting is a marker of deficient environments and hence may not only reflect poor diets but also poor economic conditions, unhealthy living conditions, lack of education, low status of women, lack of sanitation facilities and other such determinants. Addressing all of these would reflect in better improvements in stunting, but more importantly, the overall quality of life, of which stunting is only one marker,” stated the review.""Why are we happy with the level of stunting in our country and trying to explain it away as genetic? Is it part of the nationalist agenda that everything is fine with us? If we adopt these references instead of standards, Indian data will not be comparable with any international data set making it impossible to compare our progress with other countries. We will also not be able to compare with our own past data. Is that the aim?"" asked Dr Veena Shatrugna, nutrition expert and former deputy director of the National Institute of Nutrition.","A paper in the journal Indian Paediatrics argues for such a change. The researchers recommend ditching these standards and adopting locally developed ‘growth references’ If adopted, they would immediately reduce the proportion of children who are underweight or stunted or wasted substantially.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110626927,imgsize-1183497,width-400,resizemode-4/110626927.jpg"

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
"Boeing’s long-awaited space mission, carrying Sunita Williams, aborted just before liftoff",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nasa-boeing-starliner-sunita-suni-williams-space-mission/articleshow/110631968.cms,"Boeing Co and Nasa postponed the first crewed flight of the company’s already long-delayed space taxi on Saturday, halting the countdown less than four minutes before takeoff due to a launchpad computer system issue.The CST-100 Starliner ’s flight from Florida to the International Space Station is a critical test to prove the craft can safely carry people to and from the orbiting research laboratory for Nasa.A launchpad sequencer that controls vital systems during the final countdown triggered the abort, the latest setback for a launch effort years in the making. Nasa said it’s forgoing a possible launch on Sunday to allow the agency, United Launch Alliance and Boeing time to determine what went wrong.The next launch opportunities are June 5 and June 6, Nasa said in a blog post. ULA builds the Atlas V rocket that will loft the Starliner capsule to space.Earlier Sunday, ULA Chief Executive Officer Tory Bruno said the remedy might be an easy hardware fix as simple as swapping out a part — or it could be more involved.The launch sequencer is made up of three redundant computers; two of the computers reported normal conditions, while the third one moved more slowly than it was supposed to. That automatically triggered the abort. ULA still doesn’t know what caused the third computer to behave that way.In 2014, Nasa awarded Boeing $4.2 billion and Elon Musk’s SpaceX $2.6 billion in contracts to create vehicles to ferry the agency’s astronauts to space, the centerpieces of its Commercial Crew Program.While Starliner has fallen seven years behind schedule because of to a long line of technical glitches and failures, rival SpaceX has launched nine separate crews to the space station for Nasa since 2020.The repeated delays have added mounting pressure for Boeing, which has racked up roughly $1.5 billion in cost overruns on the program. The company’s defense and space division is expected to lose money during the second quarter, Chief Financial Officer Brian West told a conference in May, citing “cost pressure” on fixed-price contracts.Boeing faces questions about the long-term vision for its space business. It’s unclear whether Starliner will be used beyond a half-dozen more missions to the ISS for Nasa. Late last year, West told a small gathering of investors that the company has a decision to make about future investment in the program, Bloomberg has reported.The Saturday launch attempt, meant to carry veteran Nasa astronauts Sunita “Suni” Williams and Barry “Butch” Wilmore, came after weeks of uncertainty about when the mission would get off the ground.Nasa and Boeing tried to launch on May 6, but mission controllers stopped the countdown after noticing some weird behavior with a valve inside the rocket, forcing Williams and Wilmore to exit the spacecraft and wait for another launch day.Engineers replaced the valve, but the launch was delayed again after Boeing discovered a helium leak on one of Starliner’s many thrusters. After weeks of analysis and meetings, Boeing and Nasa ultimately decided to move forward with the launch without fixing the leak, saying it did not pose a safety issue and that engineers would monitor it throughout the flight.It’s possible that recent launch delays will force Boeing to take another incremental charge on Starliner, JPMorgan analyst Seth Seifman said in a May 27 research note.For this mission, Williams and Wilmore are slated to stay aboard the space station for about a week. Once their mission is complete, they will undock from the ISS in Starliner and land in the southwestern US under parachutes.","The launchpad sequencer that controls vital systems during the final countdown triggered the abort.

Stunning archaeological find: Prehistoric discovery in US lake leaves experts in shock and awe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/stunning-archaeological-find-prehistoric-discovery-in-us-lake-leaves-experts-in-shock-and-awe/articleshow/110569138.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Wisconsin historians have announced a groundbreaking discovery of at least 11 ancient canoes in Lake Mendota , near Madison. This significant find includes a canoe dating back to 2500 BC. The Wisconsin Historical Society revealed the discovery on May 23, noting that the initial two canoes were found in 2021 and 2022.Dr Amy Rosebrough, State Archaeologist for the Wisconsin Historical Society, explained the importance of this find, saying, ""The Indigenous peoples of Wisconsin and the wider United States fished, traveled, and traded extensively on inland lakes and streams, and until now we have not had a clear look at the canoes used in the Great Lakes region."" She likened the discovery to understanding life in the Midwest without ever seeing a real pickup truck, emphasizing the crucial role canoes played in transportation and trade.Radiocarbon dating revealed that the oldest canoe dates back to 2500 BC, contemporary with the construction of Stonehenge, and much earlier than the founding of Ancient Rome or the birth of Jesus Christ. The youngest canoe dates to 1250 AD.Not all canoes will be removed from the lake due to their fragility. Rosebrough mentioned that divers also found stone tools in the water, suggesting the presence of an ancient village site, which has yet to be located. ""Even without finding the village, the discovery of these canoes and the tools found within the first canoe reminds us that people have lived and worked alongside the lake for thousands of years,"" she added.Efforts are ongoing to explore the lake further, using non-destructive remote sensing techniques to uncover more about this prehistoric site. Rosebrough highlighted the unique archaeological potential of smaller bodies of water like Lake Mendota, which often receive less funding than the Great Lakes but hold distinct historical significance.The Wisconsin Historical Society, in partnership with Native Nations in Wisconsin, aims to uncover and share the rich history of these discoveries at the new Wisconsin History Center, set to open in early 2027.","Wisconsin historians have announced a groundbreaking discovery of at least 11 ancient canoes in Lake Mendota.

"'911 S5': Chinese national arrested, FBI takes down huge global army of zombie computer devices",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/911-s5-chinese-national-arrested-fbi-takes-down-massive-global-army-of-zombie-computer-devices/articleshow/110548700.cms,"The botnet operated by infecting residential Windows computers with malware, transforming them into ""zombie"" machines that could be controlled remotely.

What was the ""911 S5"" botnet?

The ""911 S5"" botnet was a vast network of malware-infected computers spanning nearly 200 countries. According to FBI Director Christopher Wray, it was ""likely the world's largest"" and facilitated numerous cybercrimes, including identity theft, financial fraud, and access to child exploitation materials.

Who was behind the botnet?

Yunhe Wang, a 35-year-old Chinese national, was identified as the administrator of the botnet. Wang was arrested in Singapore on May 24. He allegedly managed the network through 150 dedicated servers, half of which were leased from US-based service providers.

How did the botnet operate?

The botnet operated by infecting residential Windows computers with malware, transforming them into ""zombie"" machines that could be controlled remotely. Cybercriminals purchased access to these compromised computers, using them to carry out various illegal activities.

What kind of crimes were committed using the botnet?

Criminals used the botnet for a staggering array of crimes. These included identity theft, financial fraud, child exploitation, bomb threats, and cyberattacks. The botnet was also involved in defrauding financial institutions and federal lending programs, including pandemic relief scams. US Attorney General Merrick Garland stated that the criminals were responsible for over $5.9 billion in estimated losses from relief program fraud.

What assets were seized during the operation?

Law enforcement seized approximately $29 million in cryptocurrency, luxury goods valued at $4 million, and about $30 million in real estate. These assets were located in various countries, including Singapore, Thailand, Dubai, and others. Additionally, 22 domains associated with the botnet were also seized.

How did the law enforcement operation unfold?

The operation, named Operation Tunnel Rat, involved executing multiple search warrants and conducting interviews in Singapore and Thailand. The FBI, along with international partners, dismantled the botnet's infrastructure and arrested Wang. Authorities are also looking into the possibility of additional arrests.

How did the public get involved in this operation?

The FBI has set up a web page where individuals can check if their IP address was among those compromised by the botnet. This helps potential victims identify and mitigate any security issues stemming from the infection.

What happens next for Yunhe Wang?

The US is currently awaiting Wang's extradition from Singapore. Brett Leatherman, deputy assistant director with the FBI’s Cyber Division, emphasized the urgency of the extradition, stating, “We want him, you know, as soon as possible.”

An international law enforcement team has made a significant breakthrough in the fight against cybercrime, arresting a Chinese national and dismantling a massive botnet that has been operational for nearly a decade. This botnet, known as "" 911 S5 ,"" was responsible for various illegal activities, including identity theft, child exploitation, and financial fraud . The takedown involved cooperation between authorities in multiple countries, highlighting the global nature of cybercrime and the necessity of international collaboration to combat it.The botnet, managed by Yunhe Wang , infected millions of computers across nearly 200 countries. This network of compromised machines, often referred to as ""zombie"" computers, was used by criminals to carry out a wide array of illicit activities.

Hush money trial: Donald Trump is convicted on all 34 charges. Now what?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hush-money-trial-donald-trump-is-convicted-on-all-34-charges-now-what/articleshow/110577474.cms,"What happens now

The next step is for Judge Juan Merchan to approve the verdict and enter a final judgment. This is usually a formality. Sentencing typically follows within several weeks, but legal arguments can delay this process. Lawyers on both sides will recommend sentences, which will be debated at the sentencing hearing where Merchan will make a final decision.

Will Trump go to prison?

That is unlikely. While the maximum sentence for falsifying business records is four years in prison, it is rare for first-time offenders of this crime in New York to receive prison time. ""Punishments like fines or probation are more common,"" and alternatives like home confinement or curfews could be considered, given the logistical challenges of imprisoning a former president with a lifetime Secret Service detail.

Can Trump appeal the conviction?

Yes, Trump is expected to appeal. He may argue that the indictment was legally flawed and politically motivated. His defense will likely focus on several legal points, including that state election laws do not apply to federal elections and that the charges themselves were legally improper.

Could Trump still become president?

Yes, the US Constitution only requires that presidents be at least 35 years old and natural-born US citizens who have lived in the country for 14 years. Even if he were in jail, Trump could theoretically be sworn in as president on January 20, 2025.

Can Trump vote for himself?

Yes, as long as Trump is not imprisoned in New York, he can vote for himself. Florida defers to other states' rules on felony disenfranchisement, and in New York, felons regain their voting rights once they are out of prison, even if on parole.

Will Trump's conviction affect his campaign?

The conviction does not legally prevent Trump from running for or becoming president. The Republican National Convention, which will take place shortly after his sentencing, has no rules disqualifying a convicted nominee. Trump remains popular among the GOP base, and the party's leadership is aligned with him.

What are the broader implications of this conviction?

The conviction marks unprecedented territory in US politics, especially as Trump faces three other criminal cases. The Manhattan jury found Trump guilty on all 34 counts after deliberating for two days. The trial included explicit testimony and evidence that implicated Trump in approving a $130,000 payment to silence Stormy Daniels during the 2016 campaign.

What are the next steps for Trump legally and politically?

Following his sentencing, Trump can appeal to higher courts. His defense team has already laid groundwork for appeals, citing potential judicial bias and procedural issues. Politically, Trump continues to rally support, painting the conviction as a politically motivated attack. Despite the legal challenges, leading strategists believe Trump remains a formidable candidate for the 2024 election.

Boeing Starliner launch scrubbed in final minutes of countdown,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/boeing-starliner-launch-scrubbed-in-final-minutes-of-countdown/articleshow/110631198.cms,"Vital test

CAPE CANAVERAL: The first crewed flight of Boeing 's Starliner spaceship was dramatically called off Saturday with just under four minutes left on the launch countdown clock, for reasons that aren't yet clear.It was the second time the test mission to the International Space Station was scrubbed with the astronauts strapped in and ready to lift off, and yet another setback for the troubled program, which has already faced years of delays and safety scares.Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are waiting to be safely removed from the capsule. Mission commander Wilmore had earlier given a short but rousing speech telling tens of thousands of people tuning into the live feed that ""It's a great day to be proud of your nation.""The former US Navy test pilots, who each have two spaceflights under their belts, were previously called back to quarantine after an aborted launch attempt on May 6 due to a faulty valve on the United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket.A backup date is available for Sunday, but it's not yet known whether the Starship will be ready to launch.Starliner is poised to become just the sixth type of US-built spaceship to fly NASA astronauts, following the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs in the 1960s and 1970s, the Space Shuttle from 1981 to 2011, and SpaceX 's Crew Dragon from 2020.NASA is looking to certify Boeing as a second commercial operator to ferry crews to theISS -- something Elon Musk's SpaceX has already been doing for the US space agency for four years.Both companies received multibillion-dollar contracts in 2014 to develop their gumdrop-shaped, autonomously piloted crew capsules, following the end of the Space Shuttle program in 2011 that left the US temporarily reliant on Russian rockets for rides.Boeing, with its 100-year history, was heavily favored over its then-upstart competitor, but its program fell badly behind amid embarrassing setbacks that mirrored the myriad problems afflicting its commercial airline division.These ranged from a software bug that put the spaceship on a bad trajectory on its first uncrewed test, to the discovery that the cabin was filled with flammable electrical tape after the second.While teams were working to replace the faulty valve that postponed the previous launch attempt, a small helium leak located in one of the spacecraft's thrusters came to light.But rather than replace the seal, which would require taking Starliner apart in its factory, NASA and Boeing officials declared it safe enough to fly as is.- Manual flying -Earlier Saturday, Wilmore and Williams emerged from the historic Neil A. Armstrong Operations and Checkout Building, exchanging thumbs-up signs and waves with their families before boarding a van that took them to their launch pad.When they do fly, they will be tasked with putting Starliner through the wringer, including taking manual control of the spacecraft.Starliner is set to dock with the ISS for eight days as the crew carry out tests, including simulating whether the ship can be used as a safe haven in the event there is a problem on the orbital outpost.After undocking, it will re-enter the atmosphere and carry out a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the western United States.A successful mission would offer Boeing a much-needed reprieve from the intense safety concerns surrounding its 737 MAX passenger jets.It's also important for more immediate reasons: the Urine Processor Assembly on the ISS, which recycles water from astronauts' urine, suffered a failure this week and its pump needs to be replaced, Dana Weigel, NASA's ISS program manager, told reporters.This mission is thus tasked with carrying spare equipment, which weighs around 150 pounds (70 kilograms). To make way for it, two astronauts' suitcases containing clothes and toiletries had to be pulled off, meaning they'll need to rely on backup supplies kept on the station.","The first crewed flight of Boeing's Starliner spaceship was dramatically called off Saturday. A backup date is available for Sunday, but it's not yet known whether the Starship will be ready to launch.

Authorities are urging people to stay indoors, hydrate and avoid unnecessary travel. Demand for power has surged because of the high temperatures, putting a strain on existing electricity sources.UNICEF said resilient energy refers to reliable, flexible, accessible and quality power supplies that can withstand and recover quickly from unanticipated shocks, such as power outages and floods.It said more resilient energy supplies for schools would reduce dropout rates and improve children’s learning so they can earn more in the future.“Children depend on schools, health centers and safe drinking water for their survival, yet these facilities often don’t have the electricity supply to function optimally. As the current heatwave grips the country, electricity needs have skyrocketed, leading to shortfalls that can endanger children’s health,” said Abdullah Fadil, the UNICEF representative in Pakistan.UNICEF said 3.5 billion people live without reliable power worldwide.It said climate change is contributing to the disruption of generation and distribution of energy in Pakistan, where floods triggered by climate-induced monsoon rains in 2022 killed 1,739 people. It said almost half of the water infrastructure, such as storage tanks, wells and supply lines, was damaged by the floods.This year, Pakistan recorded its wettest April since 1961 with more than double the usual rainfall for the month. Heavy rains last month killed scores of people and destroyed property and farmland.Daytime temperatures in May have soared as much as 8 C (14 F) above average temperatures for the month over the last 20 years, raising fears of flooding in the northwest because of glacial melting.UNICEF said it helped restore water systems for 350,000 people in 375 locations after the 2022 floods and has also implemented several solar electrification initiatives in Pakistan.“Pakistan has an abundance of renewable resources and by investing in them we are tapping into a goldmine to help children,” Fadil said. ""We need the private sector to play a bigger role as public sector resources will not be enough. This is everybody’s business.”","UNICEF says developing resilient energy systems to power health facilities in Pakistan could avert over 175,000 deaths by 2030.

Across Myanmar, around 2.7 million have been forced to flee by the civil war.- Looting -The AA has not allowed residents to live back in Pauktaw, citing the danger of more air or artillery strikes on the town, although it does allow them to come and go to pick up items.The man who spoke to AFP said he had returned to check on his house and found it partly in ruins, with the family statue of the Buddha fallen onto the floor.His savings box -- containing money for a Buddhist ritual for his children and for timber to repair a roof damaged by a cyclone last year -- was gone, he said.""I have lost all of that money,"" he said.""Everything in our house got stolen... my father's fishing nets were stolen,"" another woman said, also requesting anonymity.""I am a tailor, and luckily, I managed to save my sewing machines.""During the fighting, both sides looted houses and damaged buildings, according to local reports.In March, the AA said it would ""investigate"" any reports of looting by its members during the fighting.- 'Decisive battle' -The AA's offensive has seized swathes of territory in Rakhine state and along the border with India and Bangladesh.It has said it will capture state capital Sittwe, 25 kilometres from Pauktaw and the last major town in northern Rakhine in the military's hands.In April, the AA warned residents of the town, which is home to an India-backed deep sea port, to leave ahead of a ""decisive"" battle.Sittwe residents contacted by AFP said the military was restricting travel out of the town by road and river and the prices of basic foods such as rice and eggs had doubled.Those already displaced from Pauktaw fear further fighting nearby.""I am sad that we have fled our own house and we can't live in it,"" one resident told AFP.""I have pawned my necklace for 18 lakhs ($850) so we have money to live. I still hope I can claim it back.""Others said they wanted payback.""I haven't joined the Arakan Army because I am worried about who will look after my child,"" one woman said.""If I wasn't... I would join them and fight back. I will be satisfied only if I can take revenge.""","Fighters from the Arakan Army (AA) ethnic minority armed group took control of Pauktaw in January. Four months later, the town is mostly empty of residents, who are living on the outskirts.

The tobacco industry 's targeting of youth is rampant across our member states. As a result, we have a very worrying 11 million adolescents using various tobacco products. Coupled with the approximate 411 million adult tobacco users, our region, unfortunately, has the highest number of adolescent and adult users globally,"" Wazed said in a statement.The tobacco industry lures youths by aggressively introducing new nicotine and tobacco products such as electronic cigarettes and heated tobacco products, which are becoming increasingly popular among the youths in the region, she said.This multibillion-dollar industry recruits new tobacco users to reward their investors with even more profits. To achieve this, it preys on children and adolescents through marketing tactics, targeting them with new products, Wazed stated.""It is worrying that children and adolescents are regularly exposed to the digital marketing of tobacco products. This is despite having policies and regulations in place to prevent this,"" she said.""This situation is likely to get worse, as youngsters spend more time on social media and other similar platforms,"" Wazed said, highlighting that personalised and targeted advertising by the industry appears to dominate here, exposing them to harm.This year's theme for World No Tobacco Day is 'Protecting Children from Tobacco Industry Interference'.The tobacco industry is fast to launch new products, using every means to expand market share before the regulations can catch up, she said.It continues to oppose evidence-based measures, such as increases in excise taxes, and comprehensive bans on tobacco advertising, promotions and sponsorships. The companies even threaten legal action against governments that try to protect the health of their citizens, the WHO regional director added.Wazed pointed out that the response from governments and institutions lags in the matter.""Our efforts are complicated by the rapid changes in the marketing strategies of the tobacco industry,"" she said, emphasising that the relevant provisions of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) '? including Article 5.3 '? should be implemented in letter and spirit.Also, necessary tools and support are urgently needed to facilitate monitoring and implementation of the WHO FCTC recommendations in 'online' settings, she added.""Our goal for our youth is clear. We want to prevent and reduce tobacco consumption, nicotine addiction, and exposure to new tobacco products. To do this, we need a multi-stakeholder approach to frame and implement legislation, policies, regulations and administrative measures,"" the WHO's South-East Asia director said.""This approach needs to cast a wide net.

DHAKA: Bangladesh forest experts warned Tuesday a key tiger habitat hit by a deadly cyclone had been submerged by seawater deeper and longer than ever before, raising fears for endangered wildlife.Cyclone Remal, which made landfall in low-lying Bangladesh and neighbouring India on Sunday evening, killed at least 38 people in both nations and affected millions more.More than a million people fled inland to concrete storm shelters before the cyclone hit.But it was the vast Sundarbans mangrove forest straddling Bangladesh and India, where the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers meet the sea that took the brunt of the force.The forest, which hosts one of the world's largest populations of Bengal tigers, was swamped, said Mihir Kumar Doe, the head of Bangladesh's southern forest department.""The entire Sundarbans was under water for more than 36 hours during the cyclone,"" Doe told AFP.""All its freshwater ponds, numbering more than 100, were washed away by saline tidal water.""At least 114 Bengal tigers live in Bangladesh's portion of the Sundarbans, according to official figures.Abu Naser Mohsin Hossain, Bangladesh's senior forest official for the Sundarbans, had said he feared for the wildlife if the freshwater lakes were tainted.""We are worried,"" said Hossain. ""These ponds were the source of fresh water for the entire wildlife in the mangroves including the endangered Bengal tigers.""The Sundarbans, the world's biggest mangrove forest, is regularly battered by intense monsoon storms.But Azizur Rahman, director of the state-run Bangladesh Meteorological Department, said the cyclone was ""one of longest in the country's history"", blaming climate change for the shift.Doe said his teams had recovered dozens of dead spotted deer, as well as boars, the tigers' main prey.""We are very concerned over the wild animals including tigers,"" Doe said.""The Sundarbans is such a dynamic ecosystem, it is tough to know whether any tigers or wild animals were washed away or died.""Mangroves grow mainly in seawater or brackish water but Doe said the flooding was on a scale he had not witnessed before.""This 36-hour inundation is very unusual,"" he said, noting that it was three times longer than during Cyclone Sidr in 2007.During the latest cyclone, areas nearer the sea were three metres (10 feet) underwater, while areas further upstream were under 1.2-1.5 metres (4-5 feet) of water.""Even during low tide, the water did not recede,"" Doe said. ""This is very unusual.""Tiger expert Monirul Khan, zoology professor at Jahangirnagar University, said he feared smaller animals such as deer would be hardest hit.""I fear for the animals who are less strong such as spotted deer,"" he said.""Spotted deer are helpless to strong tides during cyclones or longer inundation of the forest.

'Rishi Sunak's new policies help Tories narrow gap with Labour',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/rishi-sunaks-new-policies-help-tories-narrow-gap-with-labour/articleshow/110541235.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: In a sudden turn of events, the Conservative Party , led by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak , has significantly narrowed the gap with the Labour Party ahead of the upcoming General Election . According to a new poll conducted by JL Partners, Labour's lead over the Conservatives has decreased from 18 points in April to just 12 points. This shift in public opinion marks a critical moment for both parties as they gear up for what promises to be a closely contested election.Prime Minister Sunak's recent policy initiatives appear to be resonating with voters, contributing to the narrowing of the gap. The new policies, aimed at addressing key issues such as the cost of living, healthcare, and national security, have bolstered the Conservative Party's standing in the polls. Sunak's focus on economic stability and pragmatic governance has been a central theme of his campaign, a Daily Mail report said.One of the key factors in this shift has been the public's response to the government's handling of economic challenges. Sunak has emphasized the need for fiscal responsibility while promising targeted support for those most affected by rising living costs. His policies have included measures to reduce inflation, support small businesses, and ensure that public services are adequately funded.Labour leader Keir Starmer, who had been enjoying a comfortable lead for several months, now faces increased pressure to maintain his party's advantage. Starmer's campaign has focused on issues such as social justice, public health, and education reform. However, the recent poll suggests that some voters may be reconsidering their support in light of the Conservative Party's renewed efforts.The tightening race reflects the dynamic and unpredictable nature of British politics. As both parties ramp up their campaigns, they are likely to intensify their efforts to sway undecided voters and solidify their bases. The Labour Party will need to reinforce its message and address any vulnerabilities that may have contributed to the narrowing gap.Political analysts suggest that the upcoming weeks will be crucial for both parties. The Conservatives will aim to continue their momentum by highlighting their recent policy successes and outlining their vision for the future. Meanwhile, Labour will need to counteract this by emphasizing their commitment to addressing inequality and improving public services.The public's perception of the leaders' performances will also play a significant role in the election outcome. Sunak's leadership style, characterized by his economic expertise and calm demeanor, contrasts with Starmer's focus on social issues and reform. Voters' evaluations of these contrasting approaches will be critical in determining the final result, the Daily Mail report said.As the election date approaches, both parties will be keenly aware of the importance of maintaining voter engagement and addressing the key concerns of the electorate. The race is expected to be highly competitive, with each party striving to gain the upper hand.The poll results have injected a new sense of urgency into the campaigns, underscoring the high stakes of the upcoming election. With the gap between the parties narrowing, the outcome remains uncertain, and both Sunak and Starmer will need to navigate the complexities of the political landscape to secure a victory.",The Conservative Party has significantly narrowed the gap with the Labour Party ahead of the upcoming General Election.

Mohammed vs John: Your name may decide car insurance premium in UK,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/mohammed-vs-john-your-name-may-decide-car-insurance-premium-in-uk/articleshow/110541073.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: An investigation has uncovered a significant discrepancy in car insurance premiums between drivers named Mohammed and those with traditionally British names like John . This revelation has ignited a debate about potential biases within the car insurance industry and the fairness of its pricing strategies .The study, conducted by the Daily Mail, involved requesting car insurance quotes from leading insurance companies for drivers with identical profiles but different names. The findings were striking: drivers named Mohammed were consistently quoted higher premiums than their counterparts named John. This difference in pricing has raised concerns about possible discrimination based on names, which often serve as indicators of ethnicity.One example highlighted by the study showed that a driver named Mohammed was quoted £1,333 for a year's coverage, while a driver named John with the same profile was quoted only £1,268. This pattern was repeated across multiple insurance providers, suggesting that the disparity is not an isolated incident, the Daily Mail report said.The insurance industry has defended its pricing practices. A spokesperson said, ""Insurance premiums are calculated based on a wide range of factors, including risk assessment data and historical claims information. We do not discriminate based on names."" However, the results of the investigation suggest that there may be an implicit bias in the risk assessment algorithms or historical data used to determine premiums.Consumer rights advocates are calling for greater transparency in how insurance premiums are determined. They argue that the current system may unfairly penalize individuals based on their name or perceived ethnicity. One advocate emphasized, ""It's crucial that the insurance industry addresses these disparities to build trust and provide fair treatment for all customers.""The implications of these findings are significant. If names can influence insurance premiums, it suggests that other forms of implicit bias may also be affecting the financial services industry. This calls into question the fairness and equity of other pricing and risk assessment practices.Calls for regulatory oversight and investigation into the insurance industry's pricing practices are growing louder. Lawmakers and consumer protection agencies are being urged to examine whether these disparities constitute a violation of anti-discrimination laws. An industry-wide review could lead to reforms designed to ensure that all customers are treated equitably, regardless of their name or ethnic background, the Daily Mail report added.This report contributes to the broader conversation about systemic biases in various sectors and underscores the importance of addressing these issues to ensure equitable treatment for all individuals. The insurance industry, like many others, faces the challenge of ensuring that its practices do not inadvertently perpetuate discrimination.",An investigation has uncovered a significant discrepancy in car insurance premiums between drivers named Mohammed and those with traditionally British names like John.

The offer, valued at £3.6 billion ($4.6 billion), was deemed ""fair and reasonable"" by IDS chairman Keith Williams. EP Group already holds a 27.6 percent stake in IDS, and the takeover is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals.Royal Mail, a former state monopoly privatised in 2013, has seen its core letters business suffer as consumers increasingly communicate online. However, this shift has benefited its international parcels business, GLS.Britain's communications regulator, Ofcom, has proposed reducing Royal Mail's delivery frequency to five or even three days per week, potentially saving the company hundreds of millions of pounds. IDS has long advocated for a reform of the universal service obligation (USO), which requires Royal Mail to deliver letters six days a week to all 32 million addresses in the UK for the price of a stamp.EP Group sees IDS as ""a strong business with solid foundations and the potential to become one of the leading postal logistics groups in Europe"", subject to modernisation that includes USO reform.Kretinsky expressed his group's ""utmost respect for Royal Mail's history and tradition"", acknowledging the responsibility that comes with owning a business with more than 500 years of history. The accepted offer was priced at 370 pence per IDS share, and following the announcement, IDS stock rose 2.9 percent to 330.5 pence in early London trading.Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, noted that GLS has long been considered the ""jewel in the company's crown"", enjoying a level of success that Royal Mail has struggled to achieve, and EP Group will have been eyeing the long-term opportunities in this area. EP has committed to honouring IDS management's promise not to impose compulsory redundancies at Royal Mail until April next year.Dave Ward, general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, plans to meet with EP next week to call for further commitments on the company's future. IDS employs approximately 153,000 staff, with the vast majority representing Royal Mail.","International Distribution Services (IDS) has accepted a takeover proposal from Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky's conglomerate, EP Group.

It has accused the government of 14 years of economic mismanagement, failing to give business the stability it craves and leaving people worse off.Britain's economic performance since the coronavirus pandemic has been the weakest among the Group of Seven economies with the exception of Germany, weighed down by high levels of debt and stuck in a rut of slow growth.Reeves will say later on Tuesday the endorsement shows that Labour can bring business investment back to Britain. ""Our plans for growth are built on partnership with business,"" she will say.Sunak's Conservatives say they have had to steer the economy through the twin shocks of COVID-19 and the energy spike that followed Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. A recent drop in inflation, they say, shows that the economy is back on track.After an underwhelming start to the election campaign, Sunak has proposed tax cuts for millions of pensioners - the section of the electorate that is most likely to vote Conservative.The new proposal will cost 2.4 billion pounds ($3.1 billion)a year by 2029/30 and be funded through government efforts to clamp down on tax avoidance and evasion, the party said.","More than 100 business leaders have given their support to Britain's opposition Labour Party.

EU elections litmus test for Europe climate action plan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/eu-elections-litmus-test-for-europe-climate-action-plan/articleshow/110631082.cms,"The world's most ambitious climate plan has become a major political liability. Public support for the European Union's Green Deal , aimed at eliminating carbon emissions by 2050, is under threat as an energy crisis hits voters' wallets. A flood of incentives for clean technologies unleashed by the US and China has also stoked concerns that Europe's sticks-over-carrots approach will make it less competitive.The extent of the damage will be made clear when citizens vote in parliamentary elections from June 6 to June 9. In their campaigns, leading mainstream candidates have shifted from framing the climate action as a way for Europe to lead globally to focusing on how they'll protect domestic industries and limit the cost to households. Meanwhile, discontent over everything from boiler bans to sustainable farming directives has helped climate-skeptic right-wing parties gain support.""Many people feel the democratic parties have failed to find credible solutions to their daily problems and they view the climate transition as a financial burden,"" said Dirk Messner, president of Germany's Environment Agency.While polls show that a coalition of mainstream parties is forecast to retain a majority in the EU Parliament for its next five-year term, the gravity is shifting to the right. Far-right groups are set to increase their number of seats.The challenge for the next European Commission, which will be formed after the vote, and the 27 member states, will be to find more funding for the Green Deal even as other pressures mount. Many member states want to boost defence spending amid a worsening geopolitical environment following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.It's a dilemma with no easy solution. Economic growth is sluggish, inflation is sticky and government budgets are strained just as the EU approaches the hardest stretch of its net-zero campaign. The bloc had barely started including the agriculture sector in its green regulations when it was forced to soften the policies after farmers blocked highways and dumped manure in the streets.In 2027, it's set to launch a new carbon market to cut pollution from heating and road transport fuels - a move that will impact consumers. By 2035, all new passenger cars will need to be emissions-free, effectively putting an end to the internal combustion engine. ""There's a perfect storm brewing,"" said Simone Tagliapietra, senior researcher at the Bruegel think tank in Brussels. Those measures will hit consumers just as the EU reduces green grants.The backlash has overshadowed the achievements of the Green Deal. The EU managed to overcome national differences and adopt a massive package of measures to reach a tougher emissions reduction goal of least 55% by 2030 from 1990 levels. Pollution dropped 32.5% from 1990 to 2022, even as the economy grew by 67%. Even so, the bloc will need to accelerate its deployment of renewable energy, climate-friendly infrastructure and clean technologies to meet its targets. By the EU's own estimates, the continent needs to invest about Rs 1.5 trillion per year in its energy and transport systems to reach net zero.",Public support for the European Union's Green Deal is under threat as an energy crisis hits voters' wallets. A flood of incentives for clean technologies unleashed by the US and China has also stoked concerns that Europe's sticks- over-carrots approach will make it less competitive.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110631090,imgsize-1100222,width-400,resizemode-4/110631090.jpg"
