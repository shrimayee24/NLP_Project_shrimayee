Yashwant Varma : Probe panel junks both theories offered by Varma in his defence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/probe-panel-junks-both-theories-offered-by-varma-in-his-defence/articleshow/121961327.cms,"Yashwant Varma (File photo)

NEW DELHI: The inquiry committee on the Justice Varma cash case has rejected both theories put forth by the HC judge in his defence - that the cash could have been planted in the storeroom of his residence and that the storeroom was set afire by an act of arson to implicate him.The committee, constituted on March 22 by then CJI Sanjiv Khanna, comprised seasoned constitutional court judges - Punjab and Haryana Chief Justice Sheel Nagu, Himachal Pradesh CJ G S Sandhawalia and Karnataka HC's Justice Anu Sivaraman.It examined 55 witnesses, including Justice Varma, which were video recorded, to confirm every report of TOI on the sensational controversy. The panel's report also referred to TOI's March 21 story breaking the news.Also read: SC panel proposes impeachment of Justice Yashwant Varma - What probe report said Rejecting Justice Varma's defence - that ""someone could have planted the cash in the storeroom in his absence as it was accessible to everyone"" - the panel in its 64-page report said, ""The overall control and the permission to have access to the storeroom was undeniably with Justice Varma.""This should remove all doubts about the launch of proceedings for removal of the HC judge in the monsoon session of Parliament beginning on July 21.The panel cited the fact that the judge was in control of the Tughlaq Crescent bungalow to reject his defence of conspiracy and arson - essentially that someone with mala fide intention planted the cash at his official bungalow and then set off the fire. Referring to statements of security personnel, the panel noted that no one could access the house without the permission of family members and ""therefore, it's well nigh impossible for currency to be planted in the storeroom of a sitting judge, which is being monitored by static 1+4 guard and a PSO stationed at the gate at all time, apart from the fact that the house abounds with a large number of old and trusted domestic servants with over six staff quarters"".The committee also disregarded the theory of ""arson"" - ""a criminal act of deliberately setting fire to property"" - belatedly flagged by Justice Varma. Members of the panel said that by the judge's own initial version, the fire was triggered by a short circuit, besides noting that he did not follow up by registering a police complaint.Significantly, the panel also underlined that the judge had quietly accepted his transfer to Allahabad HC, in the wake of publication of a report in TOI. ""The categorical acceptance on March 20, immediately, without any demur and, respectfully accepting the decision of repatriation to Allahabad would, in normal circumstances, only be done after discussion with family members at least and after an attempt to find out the reason for transfer, having served in Delhi HC for the last three years,"" the report said.""It is his categorical case that he has served diligently for a decade without any complaint. Thus, he would have liked to find out the reason for the transfer,"" it added.In conclusion, the inquiry panel said, ""In the absence of any plausible explanation coming from Justice Varma or his family members or, for that matter, any other witness, this committee is left with no option but to hold that the trust reposed in him was belied by him by allowing highly suspicious material in the shape of piles of currency notes to be stashed in the storeroom. Whether this stashing was done with tacit or explicit consent of Justice Varma or his family members is of little significance in the face of the larger concept of breach of public trust and probity expected of the high constitutional office held by Justice Varma. ""The committee repeatedly termed the post-cash discovery conduct of Justice Varma as ""unnatural"" and ""illogical"" and said, ""Keeping in view the direct and electronic evidence on record, this committee is firmly of the view that there is sufficient substance in the allegations raised in the letter of CJI (Sanjiv Khanna) dated March 22 and the misconduct found proved is serious enough to call for initiation of proceedings for removal of Justice Yashwant Varma. ""The committee also found it odd that the judge, who cut short his vacation in the Satpura forests after having been informed of the fire, did not deem it fit to visit the site until March 15 when the principal private secretary to the Delhi HC chief justice came for an inspection.The committee also stated that Justice Varma's daughter tried to dissuade firemen from entering the bungalow by telling them that the flames had already been controlled.The report said Justice Varma's private secretary, Delhi HC employee Rajinder Singh Karki, frantically tried to reach the judge on phone from the residence. ""He had a detailed conversation with Justice Varma at 1.23am on March 15"" when the judge asked him to stay back at the residence, the report said.It was Karki who instructed firemen not to mention burnt cash in their report, the panel said. It also found from the security guard's statement that Karki and a trusted servant, Mohd Rahil ""were busy supervising the cleaning up job after the fire wagons had left"".During questioning by the committee, Karki entangled himself in contradictory statements, the report said.The committee was also surprised to find that CCTV footage had been wiped out from the hard disc between March 15 and March 25, when the inquiry started.","The committee, constituted on March 22 by then CJI Sanjiv Khanna, comprised seasoned constitutional court judges.

RAW is known for its long storylines and character development, which could be great for someone like Knight.“According to those within the company, more than a handful of people are advocating for LA Knight to be moved to the #WWERAW brand in the near future as his presence on Netflix could be viewed as something of a refreshing change.”Knight has not wrestled much on RAW in the past.He has only had two matches on the show, one in March 2023 against Cody Rhodes and one in February 2024 against Ivar. But recently, he has been making surprise appearances on RAW, and that has led many to believe that a full-time move could be near.“LA Knight has been signed with the company since February of 2021 and has two Raw matches under his belt. He’s been appearing on Raw over the last two weeks, very, very briefly. However, there are more than a handful of people like we just said that want to see him on Monday Night Raw each and every week.”Knight’s recent storylines have involved superstars from both RAW and SmackDown. After Seth Rollins beat him in the Money in the Bank match, Rollins attacked Knight on SmackDown.Then, Knight got his revenge on RAW by costing Bron Breakker a match. Later, Knight was attacked again during his own match. This back-and-forth has made fans excited and shows that he fits in well on both brands.Moving him to RAW would open up fresh rivalries and give him more screen time. It would also help RAW feel new and excited if someone as popular as LA Knight showed up every week.Also Read: SmackDown chaos: Aleister Black goes after Seth Rollins, Bron Breakker strikes","LA Knight could be getting a big change in his WWE career.

Stephanie Vaquer has a lot of respect and regard for the Bella Twins

“You two did a lot for the women’s division, so for me it’s important, and I appreciate you, thank you, now we can stay here, and for me it's important to now do something for the next generation and the women’s division to go up more and more.”

Women's wrestling has grown in leaps since it became a part of the wrestling industry. Many great names have been a part of it and shaped it into what it has become today. From Alundra Bleyze to Lita and Trish Stratus to Molly Holly to AJ Lee, they changed the landscape of women's wrestling for the better. And among them, two top names that have done a lot for women and the women's division are the Bella Twins. And RAW star Stephanie Vaquer knows their worth all too well.On the latest episode of The Nikki & Brie Show, they were joined by Stephanie Vaquer, one of the top rising stars in WWE . Their conversation touched upon how women's wrestling has evolved over time, and the positive changes that have been brought into the division thanks to those who came before. And of course, no one can deny the contribution that the Bella Twins have made over the years. Stephanie Vaquer, of course, showed her appreciation for the two sisters and how they changed the course for the women's division in the WWE.The twins are set to make a comeback to the WWE soon. While Nikki Bella is a definite in the equation, Brie is still a variable, but fans are eagerly waiting to learn if both sisters are ready to join forces once more and show everyone the magic that the Bella Twins used to bring into the ring. Nikki Bella was set to be at the RAW episode this week, but after Liv Morgan's injury, that plan was shelved.The chances of her, as well as her sister, Brie Bella, making their grand entrance during WWE Evolution are high. But with Liv Morgan out for the foreseeable future after her shoulder injury, there might be some changes in plans. Fingers crossed, they will be at the show on July 13, 2025, at the State Farm Arena in Atlanta, Georgia.Also Read: Liv Morgan vs Nikki Bella: Which WWE star reigns as the net worth queen between them?","Stephanie Vaquer has a lot of respect and regard for the Bella Twins.

This move is part of CEO Lip-Bu Tan's restructuring efforts to cut costs and streamline operations amidst financial struggles and intense market competition.

No severances for fired employees, will be selected based on performance evaluations

Intel's factory layoffs add to CEO Tan's restructuring plans

Third major layoff round in just one year

Intel is preparing to lay off between 15% and 20% of its Intel Foundry workforce beginning in July, marking one of the largest job cuts in the semiconductor giant's history. The layoffs are expected to affect more than 10,000 employees worldwide, representing roughly one-fifth of the company's manufacturing division.""These are difficult actions but essential to meet our affordability challenges and current financial position of the company. It drives pain to every individual,"" Intel Manufacturing Vice President Naga Chandrasekaran wrote in an internal memo to employees over the weekend, as seen by The Oregonian.The cuts will impact Intel's foundry division across 15 wafer fabrication plants at 10 locations globally, affecting roles ranging from factory floor technicians to researchers developing next-generation microprocessors. Unlike previous layoffs, Intel will not offer voluntary buyouts or early retirement packages, instead selecting workers based on performance evaluations and strategic priorities.""These reductions will be based on a combination of portfolio changes, level and position elimination, skill assessment for remaining positions, and some hard decisions around our project investments,"" Chandrasekaran explained in the memo. ""We are also taking into consideration factory operations impact.""The foundry layoffs represent an acceleration of cost-cutting measures announced by CEO Lip-Bu Tan , who took over the company back in March this year. In April, Tan revealed plans to cut over 20% of Intel's total workforce as part of a comprehensive restructuring aimed at eliminating bureaucracy and rebuilding the company's engineering-focused culture.The 65-year-old executive has repeatedly emphasized the need to streamline operations and reduce management layers. ""I'm a big believer in the philosophy that the best leaders get the most done with the fewest people,"" Tan stated in an April memo to employees.Intel's workforce has steadily declined from nearly 125,000 employees in 2023 to approximately 109,000 by the end of 2024. The company reported an $821 million loss in the first quarter of 2025, continuing a pattern of financial struggles that have plagued the chipmaker.These cuts represent the third major layoff round in the period of one year. Intel first eliminated 15,000 jobs in August 2024 under former CEO Pat Gelsinger , which represented over 15% of its workforce at the time. Those layoffs included buyouts, early retirement offers, and voluntary departures as part of a $10 billion cost-reduction plan. Earlier this year, new CEO Tan announced additional workforce reductions of over 20% as part of his turnaround strategy.The latest restructuring comes as Intel faces intense competition in PC and data center markets while struggling to capitalize on the artificial intelligence boom that has benefited rivals like Nvidia. The company has also grappled with delays in federal CHIPS Act funding, with much of its promised $7.9 billion subsidy package remaining uncertain under the Trump administration's review of ongoing awards.Key technical roles, including engineers working on advanced process technologies and technicians managing critical lithography equipment, are expected to be largely protected from the cuts, while positions made redundant by automation may face elimination.","Intel is preparing to lay off between 15% and 20% of its Intel Foundry workforce beginning in July.

Antonio Brown was sued for over $1 million after he failed to pay for the jewellery he had received in 2022



Celeb Jeweler Pleads W/ Antonio Brown To Give Back Diamonds After Filing Lawsuit | TMZ Sports

Antonio Brown’s bankruptcy was opposed in December 2024



Antonio Brown, one of the most popular and talented players in the NFL, has run into a huge controversy after it was alleged that he shot a man in Miami whom he had previously fought with. Recently, it was also alleged that the NFL legend ended up leaving the country and fled to the United Arab Emirates and is “on the run”. While Antonio Brown deals with this controversy, this isnt actually his first trouble with the law.Three years ago, in 2022, celebrity jeweller Shuki International, who has also previously worked for Kim Kardashian, filed a lawsuit against Antonion Brown.According to TMZ Sports, Shuki International alleged that Antonio Brown was sent a pair of diamond fingers, a ring and a white gold chain, which amounted to a whopping $1.095 million.Antonio Brown had reportedly received the jewellery on 24th February 2022 and had promised to pay $1.095 million for the jewellery by 1st December 2022, but he did not stay true to his word.In April 2023, Shuki International filed the lawsuit against Antonio Brown for failing to pay his dues but even till last year, things just kept getting worse.As per the New York Post, Jean Louis Shuki had alleged that even court orders had not compelled Antonio Brown to pay $1.095 million.Last year, Jean Louis Shuki spoke to the New York Post and said, “He’s a fanatic for the fingers…At this point, I don’t want the judgment, I just want the fingers back. They’re like the Mona Lisa.”Jean Louis Shuki added, “I still love and believe in this guy…I think we can do big business together. He has lots of talent and is legendary — but he also likes to create drama.”A few months after this, in May 2024, Antonio Brown declared bankruptcy and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. At that point in time, the NFL legend owed a whopping $2.93 million to around eight creditors and declared assets worth $50,000.But in December 2024, as per court documents accessed by In Touch, Antonio Brown’s bankruptcy was opposed by the trustee for “failing to declare assets”.The trustee said, , “[Antonio] has failed to disclose his pre-petition [transfer] of property and his interests in various entities, has not timely or adequately complied with debtor reporting requirements, and cannot establish that his Plan is feasible.”Antonio Brown has not yet reacted to the whole lawsuit and what followed after.Also Read: “She was fidgety”: Taylor Swift's behaviour as she spoke about Travis Kelce has raised eyebrows amid rumours of an engagement","Antonio Brown has run into a huge controversy after it was alleged that he shot a man in Miami whom he had previously fought with.

Matt Duchene commands the superior role in the Dallas Stars through his leadership and experience

This deal epitomizes loyalty and ambition: forward Matt Duchene has signed a four-year contract for just short of $18 million with the Dallas Stars. Instead of testing the waters of free agency on July 1, this 34-year-old veteran chose to extend his tenure with the organization, being the top point-getter for the team in the recent NHL season. His continued presence stabilizes the offensive core and only adds strength to its championship aspirations.What a fascinatingly late-blooming affair for Duchene in Dallas! Duchene single-handedly created the offensive core of the Stars in 2017-18 with 82 points in 82 games, including 30 goals and 52 assists. However, his contribution diminished in the playoffs while the tall-tale leather drove him six points in 18 games. Yet his handling and other intangible characteristics kept on counting. Having been present all season, much of the time, he found his way onto the ice, creating plays for the Dallas Stars, who reached the third round of the playoffs for the second year running to punish and humble on the mark.Since Matt Duchene has been a part of five NHL teams (Colorado Avalanche, Ottawa Senators, Columbus Blue Jackets, Nashville Predators, and currently thinking of joining the Stars), he brings along tons and tons of experience: 891 points in 1,138 regular-season matches.His versatility as a player-as both a scoring threat and a setup man, allowed him to blend seamlessly into Dallas's setup, adding scoring and some leadership to the table.General Manager Jim Nill stated that the new partnership was almost assured to succeed because of Duchene's immediate contributions both on and off the ice. Duchene's staying power within the Stars' long-term plans was cemented by his influence within the locker room and in the community beyond his numbers. With the choice to pursue a new contract and stay, Duchene demonstrates that his ambitions go beyond himself and are motivated by the prevention of seeing his team compete for a Stanley Cup.With the baggage of age slightly coming in the way, there is growing urgency for Duchene to chase that title. When Duchene said there was ""more behind than ahead,"" he was conveying the view that the decision to remain in Dallas was steeped in both the emotional and strategic. For Duchene, this is no longer just about the personal wins, it's all about winning as a team.Also Read: Matt Duchene gets honest about uncertain future with Dallas StarsThe new contract of Deuxne with the Dallas Stars points to much more than a mere business transaction, it is rather a pledge toward unfinished business shared by both parties.

Airports have been told to work closely with airlines to ensure that passenger’s issues are resolved promptly and at the ground level.

Availability of food, water, and seating facilities at terminals must be ensured, specifically during delays or congestions.

Adequate staff should be stationed at key touchpoints to proactively handle passenger grievances.

Airport directors were asked to provide full support to airlines experiencing operational disruptions, including help with gate changes and other logistical arrangements.

To ensure a safe and secure airport environment, Airport Directors were instructed to strengthen wildlife hazard management, including measures to deter birds and stray animals.

The ministry of civil aviation launched a comprehensive review of aviation safety, airline performance, and passenger support systems across the country on Thursday, in the wake of the recent Air India incident near Ahmedabad.Civil aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu Kinjarapu chaired a detailed video conference with airport directors nationwide to assess how airports are handling disruptions caused by weather changes, post-accident inspections, and airspace closures linked to geopolitical tensions.The minister also held a high-level meeting with Air India’s chairman and managing director to address three major concerns: maintaining operational continuity, improving transparency in public communication, and prioritising passenger safety.Due to ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and night flying restrictions in Europe, Air India is experiencing reduced aircraft availability. The airline has decided to scale down some operations temporarily and restructure flight schedules. Passengers affected by cancellations or changes will be rebooked or offered full refunds.Air India has been urged to strengthen its ground coordination and improve the clarity and empathy of its communication with passengers.Similar meetings were held with senior management from SpiceJet, IndiGo, and Akasa on June 18 and 19, where the minister reviewed fleet readiness, safety protocols, passenger experience, and communication strategies with all carriers. He further announced that such operational reviews would now become a regular practice.Meanwhile, the aircraft accident investigation bureau (AAIB) began a formal probe into the Air India flight crash near Ahmedabad. A multi-disciplinary team began investigations on June 12, and recovered both black box sets, the Digital Flight Data Recorder and Cockpit Voice Recorder, from the site. International teams from the NTSB and aircraft manufacturers have also joined the probe as per ICAO guidelines.The ministry confirmed that recovery work and evidence collection have been completed, and further analysis is underway. It reiterated its commitment to transparency, saying that the AAIB will follow all safety and investigative protocols.Addressing speculation around the black box being sent abroad for decoding, the ministry clarified that any decision on the location for analysis would be taken only after evaluating technical and security concerns.The ministry also urged all stakeholders to avoid speculation on such sensitive issues and to allow the investigation to continue with the seriousness and professionalism it deserves.","Airports have been told to work closely with airlines to ensure that passenger’s issues are resolved promptly and at the ground level.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says Anthropic CEO is very wrong

Google AI CEO Demis Hassabis said about AI job warning

After Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ’s recent dismissal of apocalyptic job-loss predictions, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis has also dismissed the pessimistic predictions made by Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei . Recently, Amodei warned of significant white-collar job displacement, Hassabis and Huang present a more optimistic point of view. Speaking at the SXSW London festival, Hassabis stated that AI will disrupt traditional roles but also emphasised that it will also create valuable and new jobs, particularly for those with STEM skills and technical fluency. Hassabis has asked the students and professionals to embrace AI tools and also build foundational knowledge in math, physics, and computer science, calling them essential for navigating the AI-driven future.Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warned that artificial intelligence could eliminate 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs within the next five years, potentially driving US unemployment to 20%. The stark prediction comes as AI technology rapidly advances, with sectors including technology, finance, law, and consulting facing the greatest disruption.""We, as the producers of this technology, have a duty and an obligation to be honest about what is coming,"" Amodei told Axios in an interview published Wednesday. The 42-year-old CEO emphasized that most people remain unaware of the impending transformation, calling it a reality that ""sounds crazy, and people just don't believe it.""Nvidia CEO expressed sharp disagreement with Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei’s predictions about AI-driven job automation during a press briefing at VivaTech in Paris. Huang specifically challenged Amodei’s recent claim that AI could eliminate up to 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs within five years, dismissing the notion as overly alarmist.“I pretty much disagree with almost everything [Amodei] says,” Huang stated, critiquing three key points he attributed to Amodei: that AI is so dangerous only a select few should develop it, that it’s too costly for widespread development, and that its power will lead to massive job losses. “If you want things to be done safely and responsibly, you do it in the open … Don’t do it in a dark room and tell me it’s safe,” Jensen Huang added, advocating for transparent and collaborative AI development.Google AI CEO Demis Hassabis has also expressed less concern about widespread job displacement due to AI. While acknowledging that AI will inevitably transform roles and that humanity is undergoing a shift even greater than the Industrial Revolution, Demis Hassabis remains optimistic about human adaptability. He believes AI will lead to the emergence of ""new very valuable jobs,"" particularly benefiting ""technically savvy people who are at the forefront of using these technologies.""Demis Hassabis's primary concern regarding AI lies not in job loss, but in its potential misuse by malicious actors. He stresses the urgent need for global regulation and an international framework to govern AI, likening it to a ""digital Geneva Convention,"" to prevent powerful AI systems from falling into the wrong hands.",Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warned that artificial intelligence could eliminate 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs within the next five years.

“Watching my brilliant, loving father go downhill and disappear was a brutal experience.”

“We are closer than ever before to a world where no one has to watch someone they love suffer from this awful disease.”

Bill Gates' fight against Alzheimer's is deeply personal

Bill Gates on Alzheimer’s: ‘This simple blood test could change everything’

Early detection : Researchers now recognise that Alzheimer's disease starts as much as 20 years before the development of clinical symptoms.

: Rather than expensive PET scans or invasive cerebrospinal fluid analysis, a routine blood draw might become a standard part of checkups. Proactive intervention: Precocious diagnosis by blood tests might lead to treatments that halt intellectual decline before such damage to the brain is permanent.

Two FDA-approved drugs: A modest win with massive implications

Proof of concept: These approvals demonstrate proof of the amyloid hypothesis and lead to further innovation.

Strengthened pipeline: Researchers and companies are increasingly likely to invest in comparable treatments, converting optimism into economic as well as health momentum.

“When combined with early diagnostics, I really am excited about the future of treating this disease.”

Bill Gates warns: Alzheimer's treatment progress at risk without public funding

This is exactly when investment is most needed.

Government grants support large-scale clinical trials and early-stage science that private philanthropy cannot support on its own.

Scaling up biotech instruments such as blood tests and treatments necessitates infrastructures which only governments can develop and sustain.

“If we pull back now, all this progress could grind to a halt—and no private initiative can fill that gap,”

Bill Gates sees a turning point: 'Alzheimer's no longer feels hopeless'

Technological convergence : Biomarker analysis enabled by AI, cheap genomic technologies, and wearable tech are improving detection accuracy and affordability.

Gates’s vision: A future free from Alzheimer’s tragedy



Early detection technologies detect the disease years before symptoms arise.

Targeted treatments halt or slow the disease, maintaining quality of life.

Funding and public support fuel a massive research pipeline.

Five years ago, Bill Gates experienced one of the most severe personal losses of his life: seeing his father, William H. Gates Sr., suffer through the heartless advance of Alzheimer's disease. In a stunning new essay on Gates Notes, the Microsoft co-founder vividly remembers,That experience has since driven his dedication to fighting this ruinous condition, not only through philanthropy, but through sheer technological and scientific push.On the cutting edge of Alzheimer's research today, Bill Gates finds reasons for real hope. Following his visit to Indiana University's School of Medicine in 2024, he was invigorated by what he described as ""the latest breakthrough"": blood tests that could diagnose Alzheimer's years before signs of the disease show up. Combined with recently approved medications that slightly slow the march of the disease, Gates feels the world is moving closer to a day when no one will have to suffer the agony of losing a loved one. As he states,Alzheimer's is not only a health or numerical problem for Bill Gates—it's personal. More than 7 million Americans have Alzheimer's today, including almost 1 in 9 individuals aged 65 and older. And although treatment advances have seemed glacial, Gates's path has been a witness to love-driven perseverance. Spurred on by his father's pain and his call to action, Gates has emerged as one of the most vocal voices urging more money, improved tools, and increased urgency in Alzheimer's research.When Gates visited IU's School of Medicine, he discovered a revolution in the making for Alzheimer's care: blood tests to diagnose Alzheimer's. The tests quantify the amount and ratio of amyloid plaques and tau proteins—Alzheimer's signatures in the brain, years before full-blown symptoms emerge.Gates calls these advances a ""game-changer""—not only for researchers, but also for families and caregivers who have felt helpless against the advancement of the disease.Encouraging therapy isn't confined to diagnosis. In the past few months, the US Food and Drug Administration has licensed two novel Alzheimer's medications that have been demonstrated to moderately decelerate disease exacerbation. Though not cures, these medications constitute a significant turning point—from symptom treatment to addressing core pathology.Gates's enthusiasm is palpable:Despite advances in science, Gates warns of an impending crisis: dwindling public funding. Over the past few months, budgets for the National Institutes of Health and connected research agencies have been trimmed, just when momentum is gaining steam.He argues:Gates writes.Over the past few years, Alzheimer's seemed like a black hole of despair—until now. Gates spotlights some of the reasons why the tide is turning:For Bill Gates, fighting Alzheimer's is not about making headlines—it's about saving families the emotional anguish he suffered personally. He dreams of a world where:In his most passionate sentence, Gates pleads: “We are on the cusp of turning the tide against dementia.” But he also warns that urgency must be followed by action—more money, more research, more courage in science.","Alzheimer's disease starts as much as 20 years before the development of clinical symptoms.

Sales teams face heaviest impact at Microsoft

AI spending drives cost-cutting measures

Microsoft is preparing to eliminate thousands of jobs primarily targeting its sales division, with the cuts expected to be announced in early July as the company continues restructuring amid massive AI investments, according to people familiar with the matter.The layoffs will mark the third major workforce reduction this year for the Redmond-based tech giant, following 6,000 cuts in May and over 300 additional eliminations just weeks later. Bloomberg first reported the planned summer layoffs, with sources indicating the timing coincides with the start of Microsoft's new fiscal year beginning in July.Unlike previous rounds that primarily affected software engineers and product developers, the upcoming cuts will disproportionately target customer-facing roles. Microsoft's sales and marketing division employs approximately 45,000 of the company's 228,000 total workforce as of June 2024.The company signaled this shift in April when it announced plans to use third-party firms to handle more software sales to small and mid-sized customers. Sources told Bloomberg the reductions won't exclusively affect sales teams, though they will bear the brunt of the cuts.Microsoft's layoffs reflect the broader challenge facing tech companies balancing AI investments with operational efficiency. The company has allocated roughly $80 billion for data center spending this fiscal year while executives have pledged to Wall Street to control costs in other areas.CEO Satya Nadella recently described earlier cuts as a ""realignment"" rather than performance-based decisions, telling employees at an internal town hall that ""this was not about people failing. It was about repositioning for what comes next.""The timing follows a pattern for Microsoft, which often announces organizational changes near the end of its fiscal year. The company previously eliminated 10,000 positions in January 2023 after pandemic-driven hiring, and made additional cuts to its videogame division following the Activision Blizzard acquisition.Microsoft declined to comment on the planned layoffs, with the final number of cuts still being determined to sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg.","Microsoft plans to cut thousands of jobs in July, primarily targeting its 45,000-person sales division. This marks the third major layoff round this year following 6,000 May cuts. CEO Satya Nadella calls it ""realignment"" for AI transformation, not performance issues.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121943582,imgsize-2510447,width-400,resizemode-4/121943582.jpg"

Bezos effect: Indian Creek real estate hits $105 million and rising

Future of ‘billionaire bunker’: More tech, more fortresses

Jeff Bezos No Longer World’s Second-Richest!

In a record-setting real estate transaction that has sent ripples through Miami’s luxury property market, a vacant 1.84-acre lot on Indian Creek Island has sold for a staggering $105 million, as per Forbes reports. This isn’t just any neighbourhood. Indian Creek, often dubbed the “billionaire bunker,” is a hyper-exclusive, man-made island that’s home to some of the world’s most powerful and wealthy figures, including Amazon founder Jeff Bezos , Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner, and NFL legend Tom Brady. With just 41 properties and its private police force, the island offers the kind of privacy, security, and prestige that attracts the elite.The seller, German developer Mikhail Peleg, originally purchased the land for $27.5 million in 2018. The recent all-cash deal marks a near fourfold return on his investment, setting a new price record for the island and raising the bar on what land, let alone a developed mansion, can fetch in one of America’s most secretive enclaves. This high-stakes, high-tech neighbourhood is now squarely on the radar of both real estate watchers and Silicon Valley insiders.The $105 million sale smashes the island’s previous record set just a year ago in May 2024 when Jeff Bezos paid $87 million for his third property on Indian Creek. Peleg’s lot, which faces Biscayne Bay to the west, shares borders with two of Bezos’ neighbouring parcels, which the Amazon founder acquired for $68 million and $79 million, respectively, in 2023.Initially listed for an eye-popping $200 million in late 2024, the plot saw immediate attention from ultra-high-net-worth buyers around the world. By the first day of listing, multiple offers poured in, many hovering close to the $100 million mark, according to listing broker Ilya Reznik.“Strategically, it’s the best piece of land in Miami,” Reznik said. “You’re not just buying dirt. You’re buying access to a world most people don’t even know exists.”Mikhail Peleg had once intended to build a dream home on the lot, but shifted plans after deciding not to move to the US The surging real estate values on Indian Creek were a compelling reason to sell.“He’s a savvy investor. The timing was right,” said Daniel Rudoy, Peleg’s attorney. “When you’re sitting next to Bezos’ compound and demand is this hot, you don’t wait around.”To finance the original purchase, Peleg took out a $20 million mortgage, later refinancing and expanding it to $41 million. Interestingly, the refinancing was tied to a business entity connected to British billionaires David and Simon Reuben, adding another layer of intrigue to the deal among the billionaire community.Indian Creek isn’t just about property, it’s about power, privacy, and presence. The island is patrolled by its police department, surveillance boats circle its shores, and no one gets on or off without notice. Air surveillance adds another layer of protection.“It’s like a fortress,” Rudoy explained. “There’s no place like it in the US, maybe not even the world.”Unlike sprawling estates in Beverly Hills or Manhattan’s penthouses, Indian Creek offers complete isolation with immediate water access, giving its residents the ability to sail in and out without setting foot on public roads. It’s no coincidence that the richest man in the world chose this island for his escape.Indian Creek’s real estate prices have skyrocketed in the past two decades. In the early 2000s, waterfront homes on the island were selling for single-digit millions. By the 2010s, prices were averaging above $30 million. But the arrival of Jeff Bezos, along with a wave of tech executives and hedge fund magnates, has redefined the ceiling.“Bezos changed everything,” said Dina Goldentayer, a luxury real estate agent at Douglas Elliman. “When you see that kind of capital pouring in, suddenly $100 million doesn’t seem outlandish anymore.”With Peleg’s record-setting sale, other property owners on Indian Creek are likely to adjust their expectations and their listing prices accordingly.“Now, anyone with a house is going to say, ‘If the dirt is worth $105 million, what’s my estate worth?’” Goldentayer added.The Indian Creek sale signals a broader trend: the convergence of extreme wealth, technology, and geographic retreat. In a post-pandemic world shaped by security concerns, remote work, and digital empires, high-profile figures are increasingly drawn to controlled environments like Indian Creek.“Buyers call me and say, ‘I want in on Indian Creek. What’s the entry point?’” Goldentayer shared. “Sometimes the price doesn’t even matter; it’s about access.”This trend is mirrored across global elite enclaves from London’s Billionaires’ Row to the Hamptons, but Indian Creek’s complete privatisation and proximity to Latin America’s wealth corridors give it a uniquely strategic edge.","A vacant 1.84-acre lot on Indian Creek Island has sold for a staggering $105 million.

The upper side of the range will be broken only on news of deescalation of the Israel-Iran conflict or an abrupt end to the war. There is uncertainty on this. The lower side of the range is unlikely to break since big buying, particularly by domestic institutions, will emerge on dips. If the war lingers and crude rises beyond $85 the lower band of the range will be broken.“A distinct feature of the market trend visible in yesterday’s trade was the weakness in the broader market. While Nifty remained almost flat, SMIDs cracked with the smallcap index correcting sharply by 2%.This trend of weakness in the broader market is likely to continue since they are excessively valued and the ongoing risk-off can lead to further selling in this segment.

HYDERABAD: As debates continue around the cost and viability of the Kaleshwaram irrigation project, Telangana has made a strong case before the Supreme Court-appointed high-powered committee on agricultural crisis-constituted in the aftermath of the Punjab farmers' protests against central farm laws.During their interaction with the committee over the last two days in Haryana, Telangana representatives called for a comprehensive audit and review of investments in large irrigation projects, citing their direct impact on agricultural sustainability. They proposed promoting small-scale, individually-owned irrigation systems as a viable alternative to the current large-scale, publicly-managed projects, which often come with significant financial and ecological burdens.A key recommendation was to issue insurance policy documents to farmers, similar to health and life insurance formats, to offer better financial security in the face of crop failure and unpredictable climatic conditions.Telangana Rythu Commission chairperson M Kodanda Reddy, Telangana Seed Development Corporation chairperson S Anvesh Reddy, and other members of the Telangana team also stressed the importance of developing multiple use water systems, arguing that water should serve various agricultural and non-agricultural needs.""Site selection for irrigation projects should be done carefully to minimise negative environmental and social impacts,"" they noted, while advocating for improving the efficiency of existing infrastructure and reclaiming degraded farmland instead of building new projects. Among other crucial points raised: State-wise water resource management plans should be formulated. The minimum support price (MSP) should be extended to all crops, with focus on crops like turmeric, jaggery, and mustard, given escalating input costs. Telangana also proposed that states be empowered to set their own MSP.The farmer should be recognised not just as a producer but also as a consumer, who routinely faces issues such as poor quality inputs, lack of after sales service, price manipulation, and weight fraud - areas where the Consumer Protection Act fails to fully safeguard farmers .

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

Third warning this month

Poll Do you believe the US Embassy's warning about visa misuse is justified? Yes, it's necessary to maintain law and order. No, it seems overly harsh.

Indian student's deportation sparks outrage

Over 1,000 Indians deported in recent months

NEW DELHI: The US Embassy in India has issued a sharp warning to visa holders, reiterating that “a US visa is a privilege, not a right”, and that violating US laws, even after arrival, can lead to visa revocation and ineligibility for future travel.The statement, posted on the embassy’s official X handle on Thursday, emphasized that screening doesn’t end once a visa is issued, and any illegal activity, including drug use or breach of immigration laws while on a student or visitor visa, could have lasting consequences.“Using illegal drugs or breaking any US laws while on a student/visitor visa can make you ineligible for future US visas. A US visa is a privilege, not a right… and we may revoke your visa if you break the law,” the embassy said.This is the third such advisory from the US Embassy in India in June alone, each one stressing Washington’s firm stance against visa misuse and illegal immigration.On June 10, the embassy stated that while the United States welcomes legitimate travellers, it ""cannot and will not tolerate"" illegal entry or violation of laws. A follow-up on June 16 went a step further, noting that the US has established new visa restrictions on foreign officials and facilitators of mass or illegal immigration.The latest statement comes amid a surge in deportation cases and the circulation of a viral video showing an Indian student in handcuffs at Newark Airport, allegedly being deported. The clip, shared by Indian-American author Kunal Jain, triggered a wave of concern across Indian social media.“I witnessed a young Indian student being deported from Newark Airport last night, handcuffed, crying, treated like a criminal. He came chasing dreams, not causing harm,” Jain posted on X. He said the student appeared to be from Haryana and was heard shouting: “I’m not crazy… they are hell bent to prove that I am crazy.”Jain, who tagged the Indian Embassy and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, alleged that such deportations were becoming alarmingly routine. “Every day 3-4 such cases are happening,” he wrote, describing the student as “disoriented and helpless.”As per India's Ministry of External Affairs, 1,080 Indian nationals have been deported from the US since the Trump administration returned to power earlier this year. The recent crackdown in Los Angeles has also seen mass immigration sweeps, with Trump declaring, “They spit, we hit,” in a controversial order during unrest in the city.","The US Embassy in India has issued a sharp warning to visa holders, reiterating that “a US visa is a privilege, not a right” The statement emphasized that screening doesn’t end once a visa is issued, and any illegal activity, including drug use or breach of immigration laws while on a student or visitor visa, could have lasting consequences.

NEW DELHI: India has officially fired the starting shot in its race to develop a next-generation stealth fighter jet, inviting Indian aerospace firms to help build prototypes of the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA), a project billed as a major leap in indigenous defense capabilities.The Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA), the design and development arm under the ministry of defence, has issued an expression of interest (EOI) to shortlist Indian companies for constructing five prototypes of the AMCA – a fifth-generation, twin-engine stealth fighter with deep-strike capabilities.The AMCA is expected to be a cornerstone of the Indian Air Force alongside the Tejas Light Combat Aircraft, with plans to eventually replace aging fleets and reduce dependence on foreign military aircraft.According to the ADA, only Indian-owned and -controlled companies are eligible. Single companies, joint ventures or consortiums with a proven track record in aerospace and defense manufacturing are being encouraged to apply. The selected firm will also be required to establish facilities capable of scaling into full-scale production once the prototype phase is complete.“This is not just about building prototypes,” the ADA said in its official communication.“It’s about identifying a long-term industrial partner capable of absorbing AMCA’s design and preparing for future series production.”The agency has set a strict timeline: all development, testing, and certification of the AMCA must be completed within eight years from the contract’s effective date.The AMCA project is central to India’s push for self-reliance in defense manufacturing. Once completed, the aircraft is expected to match the capabilities of other fifth-generation fighters like the US F-35 or China’s J-20, boasting stealth technology, advanced avionics, and supercruise capability.","The Aeronautical Development Agency has issued an expression of interest to shortlist Indian companies for constructing five prototypes of the AMCA.

NEW DELHI: Air India will suspend flights between Amritsar & London Gatwick (LGW) along those between Goa (Mopa) & LGW and Delhi & Nairobi, along with reducing frequencies on some sectors across its long haul network that includes North America, UK, Europe, Far East and Australia, from Saturday (June 21) for different dates until at least July 15, 2025.This is part of the temporary 15% wide body (Boeing 787 & B777) flight cuts the airline had announced Thursday. But as it comes at the fag end of the peak summer holiday season, it will impact a large number of passengers.Due to enhanced checks on the Boeing 777s, frequencies of North America sectors on which AI is the only direct operator have been cut. So now Delhi and San Francisco will have seven weekly flights instead of 10 earlier; Delhi and Toronto will go down from 13 weekly to 7 weekly; Delhi & Chicago will drop from seven to three; Delhi & Washington (Dulles) from five to three and Delhi & Vancouver from seven to five. Between India and North America, AI is the largest operator of direct flights. United and American have only a daily between Delhi & New York.Europe routes will also see frequency cuts. Delhi & London Heathrow (LHR) will go down from 24 to 22 weekly; Delhi & Paris from 14 to 12 and Bangalore & LHR from seven to six (see box). Australia, Tokyo and Seoul will also see temporary cuts.Apart from aircraft shortage due to multiple factors, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation’s temporary one-month dispensation to AI for making its pilots fly longer due to Pakistan airspace closures that required longer detours ended on June 12.So AI’s pilot requirement for the longer west flights will also increase. “These reductions will be effective from June 21 and last until at least July 15, 2025…. arise from the decision to voluntary undertake enhanced pre-flight safety checks, as well as accommodate additional flight durations arising from airspace closures in the Middle East. The objective is to restore schedule stability and minimising last-minute inconvenience to passengers,” AI said in a statement, adding, “AI apologises to passengers affected by these curtailments, and is proactively offer(ing) re-accommodation on alternative flights, complimentary rescheduling or full refunds as per their preference.”• Delhi-Nairobi1 (AI961/962) – 4x weekly flights• Amritsar-London (Gatwick) (AI169/170) – 3x weekly flights• Goa (Mopa)-London (Gatwick) (AI145/146) – 3x weekly flights• Delhi-Toronto: Reduced from 13x weekly to 7x weekly• Delhi-Vancouver: Reduced from 7x weekly to 5x weekly• Delhi-San Francisco: Reduced from 10x weekly to 7x weekly• Delhi-Chicago: Reduced from 7x weekly to 3x weekly• Delhi-Washington (Dulles): Reduced from 5x weekly to 3x weekly• Delhi-London (Heathrow): Reduced from 24x weekly to 22x weekly• Bengaluru-London (Heathrow): Reduced from 7x weekly to 6x weekly• Amritsar-Birmingham and Delhi Birmingham: Reduced from 3x weekly to 2x weekly• Delhi-Paris: Reduced from 14x weekly to 12x weekly• Delhi-Milan: Reduced from 7x weekly to 4x weekly• Delhi-Copenhagen: Reduced from 5x weekly to 3x weekly• Delhi-Vienna: Reduced from 4x weekly to 3x weekly• Delhi-Amsterdam: Reduced from 7x weekly to 5x weekly• Delhi-Melbourne and Delhi-Sydney: Reduced from 7x weekly to 5x weekly• Delhi-Tokyo (Haneda): Reduced from 7x weekly to 6x weekly• Delhi-Seoul (Incheon): Reduced from 5x weekly to 4x weekly2(Source: AI)","Air India will suspend flights between Amritsar & London Gatwick, along with those between Goa (Mopa) & LGW and Delhi & Nairobi.

According to Bajaj Broking Research,

are the top stock picks for today. Here’s its view on Nifty, Bank Nifty and the top stock picks for June 20, 2025:

Index View: NIFTY

NIFTY BANK

Bank Nifty continues to consolidate in a range as investors remain on the edge amid intensifying geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.

From a structural standpoint, a sustained breakout and close above the 56,000 psychological marks would be essential to unlock further upside potential, with the index likely to gravitate towards the 56,600–57,000 resistance zone. However, failure to clear this overhead supply zone could result in continued range-bound action, with price oscillating between 56,000 and 55,000, shifting market attention to stock-specific alpha generation.

On the flip side, a decisive break down below the 55,000 levels would negate the ongoing consolidation structure and trigger a corrective move towards the critical support cluster at 54,500–54,000. This zone represents a confluence of the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the key Fibonacci retracement zone of the prior impulse leg (53,483–57,049).

Stock market recommendations:Paras Defence and Space Technologies, and Thirumalai ChemicalsInvestor sentiment remains fragile amid intensifying geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, which have catalyzed a rally in Brent crude prices. This presents a significant macroeconomic overhang for India, given its substantial reliance on crude imports, thereby casting a shadow over forward earnings visibility for India Inc. Meanwhile, the US Federal Reserve, in its recent policy review, maintained the federal funds rate within the target range of 4.25%–4.50%, aligning with market consensus. The Fed reiterated its forward guidance for 2025, signaling a data-dependent stance with no imminent pivot in sight.On the domestic front, the benchmark index continues to exhibit a phase of time-wise correction, consolidating within a well-demarcated range of 24,400–25,200 for the fifth successive week. The price action suggests a lack of directional conviction, indicative of a range-bound market structure.On the upside, 25,000 remains a critical supply zone. A sustained breakout and close above this resistance threshold could trigger momentum-driven upside towards the upper boundary of the consolidation band at 25,200.However, failure to absorb supply at this level may extend the prevailing sideways trajectory.On the downside, immediate support is situated at 24,700. A decisive breach below this inflection point could intensify selling pressure, potentially dragging the index towards the lower end of the consolidation band in the 24,500–24,400 range.Key support is anchored in the 24,500–24,400 zone, which marks a confluence of the 50-day EMA and the lower boundary of the five-week consolidation range, making it a crucial demand zone for the index. Only a breach below the lower band amid further escalation of geopolitical tension will signal acceleration of the decline towards 24,000 levels.The stock is at the cusp of breaking above the falling trendline joining the highs of May and June 2025 signaling resumption of up move and offers fresh entry opportunity.The stock is currently seen rebounding after a base formation above the 20 days EMA signaling overall positive bias.The daily 14 periods RSI has generated a buy signal moving above its nine periods average thus validating positive bias. We expect the stock to head higher towards 1790 levels in the coming months being the 61.8% retracement of the previous decline (1945-1540).The stock has recently generated a breakout above a rounding formation and is seen sustaining above the short- and medium-term moving averages thus supports the positive bias.The daily MACD is in uptrend and is seen sustaining above its nine periods average signaling positive bias. We expect the stock to head towards 319 levels in the coming months being the 61.8% retracement of the entire decline (395-201).","According to Bajaj Broking Research, these are the top stock picks for today.

TARN TARAN : Nearly five months after Dubai-based philanthropist SPS Oberoi adopted seven years old Ekagardeep Kaur following the tragic death of her father in a deadly fire incident in Georgia, he returned to Punjab from Dubai to mark a special occasion—the birth anniversary of his adopted daughter. During his visit, he reaffirmed his promise to support Ekagardeep’s education in full, ensuring that her future remains bright despite the shadows of past tragedy.“I didn’t come just to celebrate her birthday—I came to remind her that she is not alone, and that her dreams matter,” he said in an emotive note. In a touching moment, he also announced the installation of a submersible pump at Ekagardeep’s home, which will significantly help to improve the family’s daily living conditions.The young girl's mother, Baljit Kaur, along with other family members, was visibly moved. “We lost everything when Sandeep died, but today we feel like we’ve gained a family again. We are deeply thankful,” she said with her voice filled with gratitude. She further said that Ekagardeep lost her father, but today she has a maternal grandfather who treats her like his own. “We are blessed,” she said.Notably, Sandeep Singh was one among the 12 persons who died in a suspected carbon monoxide poisoning in a restaurant in Gudauri, Georgia, on December 14, 2024.During a visit to Sandeep’s house in January , Oberoi not only announced his decision to adopt Ekagardeep but also gave a fixed deposit of Rs 2 lakh for her marriage and took responsibility for the repair of the late Sandeep Singh’s house.

Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has officially completed the rollout of free Wi-Fi service across all 43 bus and marine transport stations in the city, offering passengers seamless internet access while commuting. The announcement was made on Tuesday, June 17, 2025, and is part of a joint initiative with telecom provider e& (formerly Etisalat).The service allows commuters to stay connected through their smartphones, tablets, and laptops, whether they are waiting for a bus or boarding marine transport. The RTA noted that this move is a key step in its broader digital transformation strategy, which supports Dubai’s vision to become the world’s smartest and happiest city.“The initiative is part of [our] ongoing efforts to accelerate digital transformation across all our services,” RTA said in a statement.This latest initiative builds on earlier steps taken by the RTA to enhance digital services. In March 2025, the authority launched its 360 Services Policy, designed to reduce the need for in-person visits by shifting toward self-service models. These digital platforms, such as the Dubai Now app, make it easier for users to access transport-related services remotely.The free Wi-Fi coverage now includes:This brings the total number of connected locations to 43, covering a wide network across the emirate.The RTA has confirmed that the Wi-Fi service will undergo continuous evaluation and future enhancement, to ensure the network delivers high-quality, reliable connectivity across all public transport modes.The goal, according to the RTA, is to ensure “quality connectivity for passengers using buses and marine transport across the emirate.”RTA emphasized that the project is aimed at catering to diverse commuter needs, making journeys more convenient and productive.

In the quiet hours after disaster, the first residents of the 67-storey Marina Pinnacle Tower, also known as Tiger Tower, have been allowed back into the building to retrieve what little may be left. The high-rise in Dubai Marina was partially gutted by a fire on Friday night. Days later, the reality of what was lost is beginning to sink in.For many, it’s not just belongings, but entire lives turned to soot. Charred walls, soot-covered furniture, and gutted rooms greeted them, turning tearful reunions with their homes into moments of anguish.Salma Sherif Elhouseny, an Egyptian business consultant, had only been in Dubai for a year and a half. Her apartment on the 40th floor had been her safe space in a new country. She returned to it escorted by a Dubai Police officer, stepping carefully over blackened rubble. A video she later shared shows her sobbing uncontrollably as she is led through the ruins by a Dubai Police officer.“My master bedroom… it’s completely gone. I'm devastated, everything's lost. My jewellery, my laptop, my clothes, birth and education certificates, all the money I had, it was all here,” she told, her voice still trembling.“I know others have lost more, but I am alone in this city. This was everything I had.”She had waited several hours just to be allowed in, eventually escorted up through a cargo elevator shortly before midnight.“I was just lucky they let me in,” she said.Authorities have implemented strict controls to manage the entry of displaced tenants. Dubai Police and Civil Defence now require residents to register their names, present Emirates ID and tenancy (Ejari) documents, and wait for their turn. Entry is granted to small escorted groups, each allowed only around 10 minutes inside.Passports, medications, laptops, car keys, these are the urgent items people are prioritising as they step into their damaged homes.“There’s a system in place, and they are trying their best,” one tenant told, acknowledging the structure amid the chaos.But the process hasn’t been smooth for everyone.“Some people are misusing the opportunity by carrying heavy suitcases and staying longer than allowed. It slows everything down and delays those still waiting,” said another resident.Some floors, particularly the lower ones, appear to have escaped major damage. An Indian homeowner who visited his third-floor apartment said he felt fortunate.“Some smoke damage, but nothing serious. I consider myself lucky, given what others are going through.”For many others, especially those living on higher floors, access is still out of reach.Yasemin Fuentes, a Turkish expat who lived on the 47th floor with her husband, daughter, and three pets, has made multiple attempts to retrieve essentials, all unsuccessful.“More than 200 people were waiting, and it was too hot. I was told only those with medical needs or flights were being allowed in briefly,” she said. “We’re still wearing the clothes we fled in. I haven’t been able to get my ID or second phone.”The night of the fire, Yasemin hadn’t even been aware of the danger until a friend from a neighbouring tower called her around 10pm.“There was no alarm. I grabbed my daughter, our two cats, and the dog. By the time we got to the stairwell, it was filled with smoke. That’s when panic really kicked in.”Others, now allowed in, are documenting and sharing their losses through WhatsApp support groups.For residents living in shared accommodations, the experience has been even more constrained.“You’re only allowed into your own room. Police were very strict about that,” said one tenant.“And if you're above the 40th floor, there’s no electricity at all. We were given enough time to collect essentials, though.”Even as residents cope with trauma and uncertainty, community solidarity has begun to fill the gaps left behind by the fire.A WhatsApp group namedhas grown to over 1,000 members. It now functions as a central hub for aid, offering everything from temporary accommodation and clothing to food supplies. Volunteers continue to show up, helping neighbours with what they can.Mental health professionals have stepped in too, offering free counselling to those impacted. Daily virtual sessions featuring laughter therapy and traditional yoga are being held every morning from 6:45am to 7:45am until Friday, providing some emotional relief for those still processing what happened.There are no easy recoveries from events like this, but in the ruins of Marina Pinnacle, the compassion of a city is beginning to rebuild what flames took away.","First residents of Dubai's Tiger Tower have been allowed back into the building to retrieve what little may be left. The high-rise in Dubai Marina was partially gutted by a fire on Friday night.

UAE legalizes tobacco-free nicotine pouches to help smokers quit cigarettes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-legalizes-tobacco-free-nicotine-pouches-to-help-smokers-quit-cigarettes/articleshow/121910813.cms,"Nicotine pouches offer a smoke-free alternative by delivering nicotine through the mouth, lowering lung damage risks compared to cigarettes./ (File)

Khaleej Times





The UAE will officially allow the sale of tobacco-free nicotine pouches starting July 29, following the enactment of a new Cabinet resolution that sets technical standards for this emerging smoking alternative. The new law aims to provide smokers with additional tools to quit cigarettes.Dr Sanam Mallick, Consultant in Family Medicine at Burjeel Hospital Abu Dhabi, described nicotine pouches as small, smokeless products that contain nicotine but no tobacco. “People place them between their gum and lips to absorb nicotine without smoking or chewing tobacco. They’re popular as a discreet alternative to cigarettes or chewing tobacco. Nicotine pouches contain nicotine, the same chemical that we find in tobacco,” he toldNicotine, the addictive substance in tobacco, is released by these pouches and stimulates dopamine production, the ‘feel-good hormone.’ This process helps reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms, thereby assisting smokers in quitting.“Nicotine pouches can be a valuable tool for some people trying to quit smoking, but whether they’re a good option compared to other smoking cessation methods depends on a few factors,” Dr Mallick explained.One major benefit of nicotine pouches is the absence of smoke inhalation, which significantly reduces the risk of lung damage associated with traditional cigarettes. However, Dr Mallick cautioned that, like all nicotine products, pouches can be addictive. “They still contain nicotine, so they don’t remove the addiction, just the smoking behaviour. (Additionally), because they’re relatively new, the long-term health impacts are still being studied. ”Regarding effectiveness, Dr Mallick noted that some smokers have successfully used pouches to gradually reduce or replace cigarette smoking, while others find it challenging due to the continued oral habit. “Others may find the oral fixation or habit harder to break, since pouches still involve placing something in the mouth (similar to chewing tobacco).”Nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs) such as patches, gum, and lozenges are well-established methods known to increase quit rates by 50 to 70 per cent. “Nicotine pouches might offer similar benefits, but without long-term studies, their effectiveness compared to these therapies is less certain,” Dr Mallick added.Shiraz Khan, Chief Operating Officer at Aster Retail GCC, further explained the difference between nicotine pouches and patches. “Nicotine from pouches is absorbed through the lining of the mouth. In contrast, nicotine patches are transdermal products applied to the skin. They slowly release nicotine into the bloodstream over a period of time, helping to reduce withdrawal symptoms and cravings,” he said. “The key difference lies in the method of delivery. Pouches work via oral mucosal absorption, while patches deliver nicotine through the skin.”Currently, NRTs such as patches, gum, and lozenges are widely available in UAE pharmacies, often sold over the counter without prescription. However, some higher-dose patches or combination therapies might require healthcare provider supervision, Khan noted.NRTs are popular among smokers aiming to quit due to their discreet usage, absence of smoke, and perceived lower harm compared to traditional tobacco products. “Products like nicotine gums and lozenges have seen rapid growth due to their discreet use, lack of smoke, and perceived lower harm compared to traditional tobacco products,” Khan said.Under UAE regulations, all nicotine products must carry health warnings and age restriction labels, with sales prohibited to anyone under 18 years. Packaging and labelling are required to comply with UAE-specific guidelines, including Arabic labelling. “Only licensed retailers or pharmacies may sell these products,” Khan added.Globally, tobacco remains the leading preventable cause of disease and premature death. According to a guide released last year by the UAE Ministry of Health and Prevention (Mohap), the global tobacco epidemic claims nearly eight million lives annually, ranking it as one of the world’s most serious public health threats.In the UAE, the National Health Survey of 2018 found that nearly 16 per cent of men and 2.5 per cent of women are smokers.To bolster tobacco cessation efforts, UAE authorities have committed to providing counselling and psychological support to individuals seeking to quit all forms of tobacco, including e-cigarettes.",The UAE will allow the sale of tobacco-free nicotine pouches starting July 29.

'Mehul Choksi's Extradition To India Will Be Tough' Says Former CBI Director

LONDON: Fugitive diamond merchant Mehul Choksi is suing the Indian govt and five other people in the London high court for orchestrating what he refers to as his “kidnapping” from Antigua in 2021 in an alleged honeytrap plot.Choksi has claimed in the preliminary hearing that five people working for R&AW kidnapped him in Antigua and smuggled him on a yacht to Dominica in a plot masterminded by the Indian state in order to extradite him to India to face charges in the Rs 13,500 Punjab National Bank scam.Antigua police named Gurdip Bath, Barbara Jarabik, Gurmit Singh, Gurjit Singh Bhandal and Leslie Farrow-Guy as the five suspects, mostly UK-based, in the kidnapping. They are all being sued by Choksi alongside the Indian govt. They all deny the charges.The court documents were served on the ministry of external affairs by the British high commission in New Delhi.Edward Fitzgerald KC, representing Choksi (66), told Justice Freedman on Monday that Choksi was filing a civil suit against the Indian govt for allegedly ordering Choksi to be kidnapped on May 21, 2021 and smuggled by yacht to Dominica.India denies any involvement, argues it is protected by state immunity and that the UK courts do not have jurisdiction for this case.Harish Salve KC, representing India’s govt, said: “There is no evidence of India having anything to do with the alleged events. The claimant’s account is rife with non sequiturs and unsupported assumptions. Those accused seem a rather unlikely band of state-sponsored conspirators.”Choksi is currently in jail in Belgium where he is fighting extradition proceedings brought by India.Choksi first met Barbara Jarabik, a Hungarian luxury goods expert, in Antigua in Aug 2020. In May 2021 she is alleged to have asked him to visit the apartment she had rented in Jolly Harbour.A group of men of Indian origin burst into the apartment and told Choksi he was “being detained to be interrogated by Indian agencies”, Fitzgerald told the court, London’s Times newspaper reported.Choksi alleges that the men told him they worked for R&AW and beat him up, left him unconscious, and tied him to a wheelchair on the yacht to Dominica to extort a false confession from him and implicate the Congress party.“The evidence points inevitably to India being behind this — they had the motivation, they had the resources,” Fitzgerald told the court, the Daily Telegraph reported.Choksi denies the charges against him.

""We Are Not the Perpetrators"": British-Indians Push Back



From Tech CEO to Relentless Critic



Political Pressure Closes In



Starmer Responds



Why a Statutory Inquiry Matters



Subpoena witnesses, including former officials, police officers, and social workers;

Demand the release of classified documents and internal reports;

Take testimony from survivors in private or public;

Recommend structural reforms for law enforcement, social services, and public communication.

For many survivors, this is the first time they feel their voices might lead to actual accountability.

What Happens Next



Musk’s involvement, while controversial, showed how digital platforms can force action on long-ignored issues.

Starmer’s government is now under pressure to implement swift reforms and offer compensation to survivors.

The political debate has sharpened, with opposition parties vowing to make grooming gangs a central issue in the next election.

Final Word







After years of public outcry, multiple local reviews, and political hesitation, the UK government has announced a full national statutory inquiry into grooming gangs and institutional failures that enabled decades of child sexual exploitation.The decision, announced by Prime Minister Keir Starmer on June 14, marks a dramatic shift in tone for his administration—one that had previously resisted demands for a public investigation into what many see as one of Britain’s worst safeguarding scandals.The tipping point? A perfect storm of political pressure, survivor testimony, community backlash—and unusually, a global spotlight powered by Elon Musk , who used his platform, X (formerly Twitter), to repeatedly target Starmer’s record on grooming gangs.The term “grooming gangs” refers to loosely organised groups of men who exploited underage girls—typically white, working-class, and often in care—in towns across northern England from the early 1990s onwards.The 2014 Jay Report on Rotherham, commissioned after investigative journalism exposed widespread abuse, identified over 1,400 victims between 1997 and 2013. Similar patterns were later uncovered in Rochdale, Telford, Oxford, and Oldham.What made the cases especially sensitive was the ethnic background of many offenders—in several high-profile cases, the perpetrators were men of Pakistani Muslim heritage. However, the official framing used the broader term “Asian grooming gangs”—a euphemism that triggered resentment among British Indians, Sikhs, and East Asians who said their communities were being unfairly implicated.British-Indian communities, especially Hindus and Sikhs, have long objected to the blanket use of the term “Asian grooming gangs.” Their frustration boiled over in January this year when Starmer, in response to criticism from Elon Musk, once again used the phrase during a televised interview.Community leaders issued sharp statements denouncing what they called an ethnic smear. “Why should we be classified as part of these gangs?” asked Jay Shah, spokesperson for Friends of India Society International UK. “Asian means Vietnamese, Sri Lankan, Japanese, Indian, etc. When it comes to grooming gangs, we are Asian. When it comes to Kashmir, we are Indian.”The Hindu Council UK called Starmer’s wording a “whitewash of heinous atrocities,” noting that Hindu and Sikh girls had also been among the victims. Sikh Youth UK, which has documented grooming cases involving Sikh victims for over 15 years, said it had worked with thousands of families and even caught perpetrators outside Sikh schools. The Network of Sikh Organisations described Starmer’s comments as “extremely disappointing” and accused politicians of “protecting perpetrators rather than victims.”Both the Hindu Council UK and INSIGHT UK have since backed Conservative calls for a national inquiry—arguing that political correctness has too often silenced honest debate about ethnicity and crime.The turning point came not from Westminster but from Silicon Valley.In early 2025, Elon Musk—whose X platform has grown into a global political amplifier—began posting repeatedly about grooming gangs. Quoting survivor testimonies, reposting historical reporting, and tagging British officials, Musk accused UK authorities of “turning a blind eye to organised rape” and suggested that political leaders, including Starmer, were “cowards unwilling to confront the truth.”One post from March read: “If these were elite London girls being trafficked, the BBC would talk about nothing else. But poor northern girls? The state looked away.”While the tone of Musk’s commentary sparked debate—especially among British politicians who viewed it as inflammatory—it undeniably brought renewed international attention to the issue.By May, Musk’s X account had posted or amplified over 150 messages about grooming gangs, triggering renewed media coverage, a spike in search interest, and thousands of public responses. Hashtags such as #JusticeForRotherham, #GroomingGangsInquiry, and #StarmerFailedUs trended across the UK and US.The growing visibility added fuel to a debate already brewing in Parliament.In January, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper had quietly commissioned Baroness Louise Casey to conduct a “rapid review” into previous investigations—including Oldham and Rochdale—after persistent claims that public officials downplayed or ignored evidence of abuse.Casey’s report, delivered in May, was damning. It found that multiple public bodies “failed in their duty of care” and that in some cases, victims were dismissed or even blamed. Crucially, it called for a full statutory public inquiry with the ability to compel testimony and evidence.Simultaneously, Conservative MPs, Reform UK leaders, and victim advocacy groups demanded action. Former Home Secretary Suella Braverman, a long-time critic of the “Asian gangs” terminology, stated that Starmer had “run out of excuses.” Reform UK leader Nigel Farage called the lack of a national inquiry “a betrayal of Britain’s daughters.”On June 14, Keir Starmer announced the establishment of a judge-led inquiry under the 2005 Inquiries Act, which gives it full legal powers. He said the investigation would “examine past failures, hold institutions to account, and ensure this can never happen again.”Starmer, who previously served as Director of Public Prosecutions, defended his record, pointing to a rise in grooming-related prosecutions during his tenure. But critics argue that his earlier reluctance to endorse a national inquiry allowed the issue to fester—and exposed Labour to accusations of institutional denial.“There is no more denying the scale of failure,” Starmer said at a press conference. “This inquiry is about justice—for survivors, for their families, and for the country.”Unlike previous reviews—many of which lacked transparency and enforcement—this inquiry has legal teeth. It can:The inquiry will take several months to set up, with hearings likely to begin in early 2026. Its findings could reshape the way Britain handles child protection, race relations, and public accountability. But in the short term, it’s already had an impact:This is not just a story of abuse—it’s a story of institutional failure, political caution, and the new ways power is exercised across borders and platforms. Whether the inquiry delivers justice remains to be seen. But for the thousands of girls whose pain was ignored—and for the communities wrongly smeared along the way—this is a reckoning long overdue.","After years of public outcry, multiple local reviews, and political hesitation, the UK government has announced a full national statutory inquiry into grooming gangs.
