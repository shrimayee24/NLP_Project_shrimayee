BHUBANESWAR Two wives, two deaths, Rs 2 crore insurance cover. The double life of Odisha police constable Deepak Kumar Rout, 39, is under the scanner following his arrest for murder of his 25-year-old second wife, traffic constable Subhamitra Sahoo, who was found buried in a pit meant to pass off as a toilet.Subhamitra's body was exhumed in Keonjhar Wednesday, leading to arrest of her husband and two others, his relative Binod Bihari Bhuyan (28), and landowner Sambhunath Mohanta, who allegedly took Rs 5,000 to let Rout bury her on his plot. Mohanta hired a machine to dig the pit, misleading the operator that it was for toilet construction.The killing reopened old wounds. On Thursday, the family of Rout's first wife Aparna Priyadarshini, a revenue inspector, who died in a road crash in March 2022, lodged a complaint in Dhenkanal alleging she too was murdered. They claimed Rout tortured Aparna, coerced her into loans of over Rs 10 lakh, and later collected Rs 1 crore in insurance after her death. Subhamitra was also insured for Rs 1 crore. DCP Jagmohan Meena said Rout hatched the plan to murder Subhamitra on Aug 26 after rows over money with her, whom he had married in July.","Odisha police constable Deepak Kumar Rout, 39, is under the scanner following his arrest for murder of his 25-year-old second wife.

SC tells states to make rules for regn of Sikh marriages in 4 months,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-tells-states-to-make-rules-for-regn-of-sikh-marriages-in-4-months/articleshow/123988343.cms,"NEW DELHI: Observing that ""in a secular republic, the State must not turn a citizen's faith into either a privilege or a handicap"", Supreme Court has pulled up states and UTs for not framing rules for registration of Sikh marriages (Anand Karaj) and directed them to do it within four months.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta ordered that till the states frame rules, the registration of Anand Karaj marriages should be done without discrimination under the prevailing marriage registration framework.The Anand Marriage Act was enacted to recognise the validity of marriages performed by the Sikh ceremony of Anand Karaj. By the Amendment of 2012, Parliament inserted Section 6 of the Act, casting a duty on respective state govts to make rules to facilitate registration of such marriages, maintain a marriage register, and provide certified extracts, while clarifying that failure to register it would not affect the validity of an Anand marriage. As many states and UTs failed to implement the law in more than a decade, the apex court intervened and passed directives.""The fidelity of a constitutional promise is measured not only by the rights it proclaims, but by the institutions that make those rights usable. In a secular republic, the State must not turn a citizen's faith into either a privilege or a handicap. When the law recognises Anand Karaj as a valid form of marriage yet leaves no machinery to register it, the promise is only half kept.What remains is to ensure that the route from rites to record is open, uniform and fair,"" SC said. The Supreme Court said Section 6 of the Act discloses a complete legislative scheme and the provision, intended as an imperative, identifies the facilitative purpose of registration.""It requires the keeping of a public register with certified extracts, provides for laying of rules before the state legislature, and removes the burden of duplicative registration once an entry is made under the Act.","The Anand Marriage Act was enacted to recognise the validity of marriages performed by the Sikh ceremony of Anand Karaj.

LUDHIANA: In a village on the outskirts of Ludhiana, a crime was uncovered that was as grisly as it was puzzling — a 71-year-old NRI travelled from the US to marry her sunset love, only to allegedly be bludgeoned to death by a man hired by her would-be groom, a 75-year-old settled in the UK.Rupinder Kaur was allegedly killed by the very man whose roof she shared in Kila Raipur village (15km from Ludhiana). Her body was burnt and the remains flung into a nullah, say police.What gave away the gruesome crime was a fresh coat of paint and new floor tiles at the home of the alleged killer, Sukhjit Singh alias Sonu, a typist in Ludhiana district court.Read also: ‘Beaten to death with baseball bat’: Inside the grisly murder of 71-year-old NRI Rupinder Kaur in Ludhiana The case registered by Ludhiana Police names him and UK-based Charanjit Singh. Sukhjit is in custody and charged with murder. Charanjit is in the UK. It's not known if police have contacted him.Police said Charanjit had backed out of the marriage and got Rupinder killed because she wouldn't take no for an answer and had threatened to implicate him in a case if he refused. Police sources told TOI the motive was still a grey area.Sukhjit filed a complaint on Aug 18, reporting Rupinder missing. He said she had given her power of attorney to deal with her civil/criminal cases about six months ago, and that she arrived in India in early-July.Sukhjit claimed Rupinder lived in his house for about 10 days and left for Delhi on July 18, saying she would fly to Canada to attend a wedding. However, he claimed he hadn't been able to contact her since then.Deputy commissioner (city, rural) Rupinder Singh said, ""Police found the NRI woman was murdered by Sukhjit at the behest of her NRI friend, Charanjit Singh. Probe revealed she had relations with Charanjit, and he initially wanted to marry her. Rupinder faced an FIR at NRI police station in a cheating case and was declared a proclaimed offender. Charanjit introduced her to Sukhjit for court-related work.""""Rupinder would pay Sukhjit via bank transactions. It is yet to be checked how much and for what purpose,"" said the officer. Police say Rupinder and Charanjit met often in India and abroad, and they had their pictures to prove it.Sukhjit claimed Charanjit told him Rupinder threatened to implicate Charanjit in a rape case and Sukhjit in a cheating case. ""Charanjit lured Sukhjit by offering him Rs 50 lakh to kill Rupinder. He also offered to call Sukhjit to UK. When Sukhjit agreed to execute the murder, Charanjit asked Rupinder to travel to India, promising to marry her there,"" added the officer.On July 12, Sukhjit beat Rupinder to death with a baseball bat. ADCP-II Karanveer Singh said, ""The accused got a large amount of coal and started a fire. He put the woman's body on it to burn it, which took two-three days. He put the skeletal remains in sacks and dumped them in a water channel. He hammered her mobile to pieces and dumped it too. Police have recovered some of the remains and the hammer.""Asked how police cracked the case, a senior officer said since Sukhjit used coal inside his house, the room got damaged. Some labourers from the village were hired to repair it. ""The village was already abuzz about the missing NRI woman, and here was a soot-blackened room. It made people suspect him. Someone tipped off police.""TOI contacted Rupinder's sister Kamal Kaur, who also lives abroad. She said she had approached local police after failing to contact her for several days.Police say Charanjit and Sukhjit had known each other for decades. Charanjit has roots in Ludhiana's Mehma Singh Wala village, around 5km from Kila Raipur.","Rupinder Kaur was allegedly killed by the very man whose roof she shared in Kila Raipur village.

MobiKwik loses Rs 40 crore in 48 hours,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mobikwik-loses-rs-40-crore-in-48-hours/articleshow/123933014.cms,"GURGAON: Taking advantage of what is believed to be a glitch that blindsided city-based digital wallet company MobiKwik's systems, around Rs 40 crore were allegedly siphoned off over two days, Sept 11 and 12, from the company's account through a blitz of UPI transactions.The fraud came to light on Tuesday after the arrest of six men whose accounts contained Rs 9 lakh of this stolen money. Uncannily, this is the second time this has happened to MobiKwik. In Oct 2017, the company was allegedly similarly defrauded of around Rs 19 crore with the money being moved to thousands of personal bank accounts. This time, the glitch happened after the company updated its software earlier this month, investigators said. It apparently allowed Mobikwik users to send much higher amounts of money than their wallet balances. Transactions, the investigators said, also went through if users entered incorrect PINs.Police said how scamsters came to know about this glitch is under probe. Officials said they suspected insiders' involvement. The fraud was reported on Sept 13 by a MobiKwik employee, citing an audit that had detected suspicious transactions on Sept 11 and 12.According to cops, fraudulent transfers over those two hours amounted to Rs 40.2 crore. ""Nearly 5 lakh transactions took place on Sept 11-12, and so far, 2,500 bank beneficiary accounts have been identified. We have managed to freeze Rs 8 crore out of the total fraud amount. This money was deposited in these bank accounts,"" said a source.Five of the arrested men are from Nuh. The other is from Palwal. The accused have been identified as Rehan, Waqar Yunus, Wasim Akram, Mohd Amir, Mohd Ansar and Mohd Sakil. All six have been sent to judicial custody.Police spokesperson Ashok Kumar said if any company employee is found to be involved in the scam, strict action will be taken against the individual. Nuh police on Tuesday, meanwhile, asked people to report by Sept 23 any unexplained cash transfers they might have received in their accounts.""If anyone received transactions on Sept 11 and 12 due to technical security lapses or other reasons via the Mobikwik app or received unauthorised payments through the app and wishes to return them, or has any complaints related to such transactions, they can visit the office of the SP. People from Palwal district and other Mewat areas can also come."" Nuh police said in a statement. They have been charged under Section 318(4) (cheating) and 314 (dishonest misappropriation of property) of BNS. Cops are also coordinating with banks to recover the money and identify others who benefited from the alleged fraud.""The company is undertaking all possible and necessary efforts to recover the amount. However, since the police investigation and recovery efforts have just started, it's not yet possible to ascertain the impact. Based on the preliminary data, as a risk mitigating measure, the FIR was lodged for an amount of Rs 40 crore, out of which, the company has recovered around Rs 14 crore. Thus, the estimated net impact is Rs 26 crore. The company is taking aggressive collection efforts while pursuing legal course of action to recover the full amount over a period of time,"" a company spokesperson told TOI.","The fraud came to light on Tuesday after the arrest of six men whose accounts contained Rs 9 lakh of this stolen money.

'I Didn't Do It': Pilot's Last Words Before Air India Crash| Probe Report| Tech Failure or Sabotage?

Poll Do you think the media has played a fair role in reporting on the crash? Yes, they have been unbiased. No, they have sensationalized the story.

NEW DELHI: The father of Captain Sumeet Sabharwal, who died in the Air India Ahmedabad crash in June this year, has called for a 'formal investigation' by the central government while criticising the findings of the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) as well as the ""selective leaks"" that ""tarnish Captain Sabharwal's reputation"".In the Ahmedabad plane crash, which was one of the worst aircraft accidents in India, 260 people, including 241 passengers, were killed. Air India's Boeing 787-8 aircraft operating flight AI171 to London Gatwick crashed soon after take off from Ahmedabad on June 12.In a letter to the civil aviation secretary and AAIB Director General, 91-year-old Pushkaraj Sabharwal said that selective leaks about the accident had led to speculation that Sumeet (56) was under tremendous psychological pressure and contemplating suicide, PTI reported.""These innuendos have very adversely affected my health and mental setup and the reputation of Captain Sumeet Sabharwal. They tarnish Captain Sabharwal's reputation, which is a fundamental right guaranteed to a citizen of India under Article 21 of the Constitution of India,"" the letter, dated August 29, said.Pushkaraj has demanded that the central government order a formal enquiry into the accident under Rule 12 of the Aircraft (Investigation of Accidents and Incidents) Rules, 2017, which empowers the Centre to institute a formal investigation into the circumstances of any accident of an Indian-registered aircraft if it appears expedient to hold such a probe.There were no immediate comments from the civil aviation ministry or the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau on the letter.Amid speculation about the cause of the fatal crash following the release of its preliminary probe report on July 12, the AAIB had asserted it was too early to draw any “definite conclusions” as the investigation was still on and that the final report would identify root causes. The agency also urged everyone to refrain from spreading premature narratives.""The preliminary report on the contrary does not allude to the 'what' happened or the bare facts of the crash, instead resorting to insinuations on the one hand and offering copious clean chits to the manufacturer/s on the other. The report in its present form is deficient, diversionary & discrepant,"" the letter said.It further alleged that selective information from the preliminary investigation — including contents of the cockpit voice recorder — had been put into the public domain.Pushkaraj also refuted speculation about his son’s mental health. Citing reports, he said it was suggested Sumeet was divorced and that caused him anxiety and depression.""It even ignores the fact that Captain Sabharwal was divorced about 15 years ago. The other speculation relating to the cause for Captain Sabharwal being desirous of committing suicide has been his mother's death. His mother died more than three years ago. After that, Captain Sabharwal had operated more than 100 flights without any incident or accident.""It is most pertinent to note that in over 25 years of flying, Captain Sabharwal had not had a single incident or accident-causing fatalities or otherwise,"" the letter said.He had almost 15,638.22 hours of flying experience, of which 8,596 hours were on the 787-8. He was also designated as a Pilot Trainer — a Line Training Captain — and held the DGCA licence for that purpose.Pushkaraj added that the absence of a formal enquiry under Rule 12, coupled with selective information being provided to the media, was very disturbing and detrimental to him and affected his fundamental rights, including the right to the reputation of his deceased son.In the preliminary report, AAIB had said the fuel supply to both engines of the plane was cut off within a gap of one second, causing confusion in the cockpit soon after takeoff. ""In the cockpit voice recording, one of the pilots is heard asking the other why did he cut off. The other pilot responded that he did not do so,"" it had said.","The father of Captain Sumeet Sabharwal, who died in the Air India Ahmedabad crash in June this year, has called for a 'formal investigation' He criticises the findings of the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) as well as the ""selective leaks"" that ""tarnish his reputation"" 260 people, including 241 passengers, were killed.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123945567,imgsize-165992,width-400,resizemode-4/ahmedabad-plane-crash.jpg"

Why Kerala?

How Kerala Is Responding

Lessons For The World

On Sept 1, two patients — a threemonth-old baby and a 52-year-old woman — died within hours of each other at Kozhikode Govt Medical College. Doctors confirmed that both were being treated for primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), an infection caused by the free-living parasite Naegleria fowleri.By mid-Sept, the toll had risen to 19, with 69 suspected or confirmed cases across Kerala. Victims ranged from infants to middle-aged adults. The scale is extraordinary: globally, researchers have identified only 488 documented infections since 1962.PAM is one of the deadliest infections known to science. The parasite lives in warm, stagnant freshwater — ponds, lakes, unchlorinated swimming pools, poorly maintained tanks — and can infect people only when contaminated water is forced up the nose. From there, it travels along the olfactory nerve, burrows into the brain and begins dissolving tissue, unleashing catastrophic inflammation.Symptoms can begin in one to 12 days (typically 3-7 days): fever, headache, nausea and vomiting. Within days, they give way to stiff neck, confusion, seizures, hallucinations and coma.Across six decades, fewer than 20 survivors are documented globally, most with lasting neurological damage.The fatality rate is 97%.There is no vaccine or proven cure. Drugs such as Amphotericin B, Azoles, or Miltefosine are used in combination, sometimes with induced hypothermia, but success is rare. Crucially, PAM does not spread person to person and is not caused by drinking contaminated water; infection occurs via the noseWorldwide, PAM tends to appear as sporadic, one-off cases, usually tied to a single contaminated reservoir or swimming pool. Kerala’s outbreak is different. Cases have surfaced across Thiruvananthapuram, Kozhikode, Thrissur and Malappuram, with no single identified source.The state’s position as a public health bellwether makes the outbreak more unsettling. Kerala has often been the first to detect emerging threats: India’s first Nipah outbreak in 2018, its early Covid-19 cases in 2020 (detected in returning medical students from Wuhan), and Zika virus in 2021. The arrival of a rare, near-uniformly fatal amoeba on this list has alarmed both doctors and the public.“Eight people died in 15 days. What is the protocol? What are people supposed to do? Even a baby was infected — was that child in a swimming pool?” Opposition leader V D Satheesan asked in the state assembly this month.Protests have broken out in several districts, with residents demanding that wells and public taps be tested. Doctors caution that Kerala’s higher numbers also reflect better detection. “The symptoms — headache, fever and vomiting — are similar to bacterial and viral brain infections. If you don’t suspect amoeba, you’ll miss it completely,” said Dr Rajeev Jayadevan, convener of the Indian Medical Association’s research cell.Amid mounting panic, Kerala has launched ‘Jalamanu Jeevan (Water is Life)’, a statewide chlorination drive covering wells, pools, etc. Schools have been told to disinfect storage units regularly, while panchayats and municipalities are checking public taps and wells.Hospitals, particularly in Kozhikode, Thrissur and Malappuram, are on high alert. Doctors have been instructed to treat any meningitis-like illness with a history of water exposure as potential PAM. Rapid-response teams have been sent to test community water sources, though no contaminated reservoir has been found yet.Drugs, including Miltefosine, have been stocked. But officials concede that treatment rarely saves lives. Survivors worldwide are exceptional, often treated with a cocktail of antifungals, antibiotics and cooling therapies. That is why prevention — keeping contaminated water out of the nose — remains the focus.A 2025 review in the Journal of Infection and Public Health, which analysed 488 cases across 39 countries since the disease was first described, shows how there is little room for error — and what others can learn as climate change reshapes risk. The parasite is not the same everywhere: N. fowleri has multiple genetic strains; genotypes II and III predominate in Asia, North America and Europe.Clean water is the strongest defence: Free chlorine ≥ 2.0 mg/L in storage tanks/ pools can eliminate the amoeba; countries like Australia monitor disinfection as a routine public health practice.Surveillance changes the numbers: Strong labs and routine testing mean more detection (not necessarily more disease). Country tallies include India (26), Mexico (33), Czech Republic (17), New Zealand (9), Nigeria (4), Venezuela (7).Everyday habits can raise or reduce risk: In Pakistan, first cases were reported in Karachi in 2008; >140 cases have since been documented. Many were linked to nasal rinsing during ablution or showering, not swimming. A similar ablution-linked case has also been confirmed in the US.","Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) is caused by the free-living parasite Naegleria fowleri. The parasite lives in warm, stagnant freshwater and can infect people only when contaminated water is forced up the nose. There is no vaccine or proven cure.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123987922,imgsize-862091,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

He said it would be against Hindu rituals and would hurt religious sentiments.Petitioner H S Gaurav said the inauguration of Dasara inside the Chamundeshwari temple is not a mere ceremonial opening, but a sacred ritual that begins with the 'agamic puja' of Goddess Chamundeshwari, performed by the inaugurating dignitary. Performance of this puja by a Muslim would hurt sentiments of millions of Hindus in Karnataka and across the world, he said.Before the HC, the state through its advocate general K Shashikiran Shetty, had referred to a 2016 circular of state govt declaring that all temples coming under the jurisdiction of the department of religious endowments of the state, as well as private temples, were required to grant free entry to all for 'darshan' of the deity, without distinction of caste, community, religion or gender.Shetty said the Dasara festival at the temple is a state-sponsored function and is not a religious function of the temple or religious institution, and hence, invitation to a personality cannot be objected to on the ground of religion.Dismissing the plea, Chief Justice Vibhu Bakhru, said: ""The petitioner's right to practise and propagate religion is not curtailed in any manner by extending invitation to Banu Mushtaq to inaugurate the Dasara festivities.""",Booker Prize winner Banu Mushtaq to be chief guest for Dasara festival.

NEW DELHI: In a matrimonial dispute extending beyond India, the Supreme Court has given interim custody of a child to his father, who lives in India, saying the boy's mother took courts in both India and the UK for a ride and never intended to let their son meet his father.The woman, who had moved to the UK to escape a discordant marital life and pursue a career, deceitfully told both a British court and the Punjab and Haryana High Court that her daughter and son were living with her in England when she had actually left her son with her parents in Sonepat, Haryana. She went to great lengths to conceal from her estranged husband their son is living with her parents in Sonepat -- she hid the boy's location and background whenever his father called to speak.When the father grew suspicious and went to the parents-in-law's house, he found his son living there but was beaten by them.The UK HC had criticised the woman saying: ""It is clear from the above that the mother lured the court into error by failing to disclose that she had only removed Miss N to the UK and that Master K remained in India. This crude subterfuge, which was always going to be found out, does the mother no credit at all.""Against this backdrop, the father moved the Punjab and Haryana HC for custody of his son, which was granted to him. The woman, her parents and her brother challenged the HC order before the SC.A bench of Justices J K Maheshwari and Vijay Bishnoi, noted an interesting fact in the unusual cross-country matrimonial litigation: the woman had filed for divorce in the UK, which was opposed by the husband. And the divorce petition filed by the husband at a Jind court was opposed by her.The bench said, ""The case reflects a deep-rooted conflict between the mother and father, arising from their divergent intentions regarding staying together and raising their children in India.Granting interim custody of the child to the father, the court said the parents can initiate proceedings for custody of the child before the family court, in his best interests.","Supreme Court gives interim custody of a child to his father, who lives in India.

MUMBAI: The CBI Thursday filed a chargesheet against Anil Ambani, chairman of Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group, along with Rana Kapoor, co-founder of Yes Bank, and the latter's wife, Bindu, and daughters, Radha Kapoor & Roshni, for fraudulent loan transactions that resulted in a loss of Rs 2,797 crore to the bank.The chargesheet says the bank under Kapoor's directions invested in debentures and commercial debt paper issued by ADA's commercial finance (RCFL) and home finance (RHFL) companies despite a credit ratings agency placing them ""under watch"" for poor performance. It says the funds were subsequently siphoned out and, in a ""quid pro quo"", the Yes Bank promoter's family-run firms received massive loans from ADA companies.CBI has previously investigated several others for defrauding Yes Bank, including DHFL's erstwhile promoters Kapil Wadhawan and his brother Dheeraj Wadhawan.In a press release issued on Thursday, the CBI said it had filed a chargesheet pertaining to two cases related to fraudulent transactions between Anil Ambani's group companies, Reliance Commercial Finance Ltd (RCFL) and Reliance Home Finance Limited (RHFL), and Rana Kapoor, his wife Bindu Kapoor, and their daughters Radha Kapoor and Roshni Kapoor and companies owned by them.The chargesheet named Anil Ambani, Rana Kapoor, Bindu Kapoor, Radha Kapoor, Roshni Kapoor, RCFL, RHFL (now Authum Investment & Infrastructure Ltd), RAB Enterprises Pvt Ltd, Imagine Estate Pvt Ltd, Bliss House Pvt Ltd, Imagine Habitat Pvt Ltd, Imagine Residence Pvt Ltd, and Morgan Credits Pvt Ltd.

Chabahar Port in Iran faces uncertainty: US revokes sanctions exemption; what it means for India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/chabahar-port-in-iran-faces-uncertainty-us-revokes-sanctions-exemption-what-it-means-for-india/articleshow/123978546.cms,"



India's strategic gateway to Afghanistan and Central Asia, the Chabahar Port in Iran, faces mounting challenges as the United States revoked sanctions exemptions previously granted under the Iran Freedom and Counter-Proliferation Act (IFCA). The move, effective September 29, risks exposing Indian operators at the port to US penalties and raises serious questions about the future of one of India’s most important regional connectivity projects.Since India took operational control of the Shahid Beheshti terminal at Chabahar in 2018 through its state-run India Ports Global Limited, the port has become a linchpin in New Delhi’s strategy to bypass Pakistan and secure trade routes to Afghanistan and Central Asia.The port, situated on the Gulf of Oman, not only facilitates regional commerce but also serves as a critical channel for humanitarian aid to Afghanistan. Recent years have seen a sharp increase in cargo throughput, with over 8 million tonnes of goods handled and tens of thousands of containers processed. Plans to expand the port’s capacity from 100,000 to 500,000 TEUs and connect it to Iran’s railway network by mid-2026 further underline its growing importance.However, the US Treasury’s recent designation of an international illicit financial network supporting Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the revocation of IFCA sanctions waivers mark a significant escalation in Washington’s “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran.The sanctions target individuals and entities facilitating Iranian oil sales that finance Iran’s military and proxy groups in the region, directly impacting Iran’s shadow banking infrastructure.For India, the revocation of the Chabahar sanctions exception complicates its ambitions.The port’s operations could now come under the risk of US sanctions, threatening the significant investments India has already made—amounting to over $120 million in infrastructure and credit lines for development.This creates a diplomatic conundrum as India balances its deepening partnership with the United States against its strategic and economic ties with Iran.The Chabahar Port project is a vital counterweight in the region to China’s influence through Pakistan’s Gwadar port and aligns with India’s broader goal to expand trade corridors to resource-rich Central Asian countries and Russia via the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC). The port’s strategic location near the Strait of Hormuz enhances its importance for ensuring regional stability and securing maritime trade routes.","The United States revoked sanctions exemptions previously granted under the Iran Freedom and Counter-Proliferation Act (IFCA) The move, effective September 29, risks exposing Indian operators at the port to US penalties.

Why did Rep. James Comer call online platforms’ CEOs to testify?



What connects online platforms to the Charlie Kirk assassination investigation?



House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer has called for a high-profile hearing to investigate online platforms’ role in domestic radicalization. The hearing that has summoned the chief executives of four major online platforms will be scrutinizing their platforms’ roles in political incitement of real-world violence. The move comes after a recent tragic event that reignited debates on digital accountability. It’s being called a congressional effort to hold the tech companies accountable.The entire decision stems from the recent assassination of Charlie Kirk , a conservative commentator. It’s believed by the lawmakers that it might be linked to online radicalization. In the made, public announcement, Rep. Comer said, “Congress has a duty to oversee the online platforms that radicals have used to advance political violence.” He has explicitly stated that Humam Sakhnini, Steve Huffman, Dan Clancy and Gabe Newell, CEOs of Discord, Reddit, Twitch and Steam respectively, will appear before the committee on October 8, 2025.Comer’s aim in questioning these leaders is to prevent the platforms from being exploited for extremist purposes. Reportedly, it will be further identified whether there are any detectable warning signs or any business models that inadvertently facilitate such behavior.It has also been emphasized by Comer that CEOs will have to explain what actions they would take moving ahead, to prevent their services from being exploited for harmful purposes.Although the exact motivation of the suspect is still under investigation, the early reports have noted that he had his possible influence from the online forums. Comer, along with his colleagues, is reportedly concerned about the pattern that is emerging wherein digital communication platforms are repeatedly associated with high-profile crimes.Discord, Steam, Reddit and Twitch have previously faced scrutiny for hosting communities, where the extremist views at times thrive. These platforms, while they vary in functionality—from gaming to live streaming and more—they all enable real-time interaction as well as community formation. This often comes with limited visibility to the broader public.It’s suspected by the lawmakers that these digital spaces are becoming a 'communication of choice' for individuals who plan violent acts. While the companies do have moderation policies, it’s been argued by critics that they are inconsistently enforced.Discord has even agreed to cooperate by stating that it welcomes an opportunity to discuss critical issues with policymakers. October 8, 2025, hearing called as Congress duty would probe whether the tech giants are actually doing enough to curb dangerous content.",House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer has called for a high-profile hearing to investigate online platforms’ role in domestic radicalization.

Billionaire Richard Branson ignored on NYC streets while promoting ‘Doorbell of Dreams’



New Yorkers too busy to notice Richard Branson with a mic



Billionaire’s rejections spark laughter and praise online

British billionaire Richard Branson, best known as the adventurous founder of the Virgin Group, recently experienced an unusual moment on the streets of New York City. While promoting his latest initiative, Doorbell of Dreams, the 75-year-old tycoon tried stopping passersby for quick interviews, only to be repeatedly ignored. Despite his global fame, New Yorkers brushed past him as though he were just another man with a microphone. The incident, filmed by entrepreneur Simon Squibb, quickly went viral on Instagram, sparking amusement and admiration online. What began as a lighthearted campaign to encourage everyday dreamers to pitch their business ideas turned into an unexpected lesson in humility, showing that even billionaires are not immune to everyday rejection.During a lighthearted promotional event, Branson attempted to stop pedestrians for quick interviews. Despite his global reputation, most passersby ignored him, hurrying along as though he were just another stranger with a microphone. The unusual moment, filmed by entrepreneur Simon Squibb, quickly gained traction on Instagram, showing the tycoon facing rejection after rejection.This unexpected moment wasn’t just a publicity stunt; it was part of a campaign to promote “Doorbell of Dreams.”The initiative, launched by Branson in partnership with Squibb’s startup HelpBnk, invites everyday dreamers to pitch their business ideas in under 60 seconds.What makes the concept unique is its accessibility. Through a specially designed video doorbell, aspiring entrepreneurs can present their ideas, with the hope of receiving mentorship, guidance, or even investment. Originally launched in the UK, the project recently expanded to New York, where Virgin Hotels partnered as a venue for participants. The street interviews were meant to spark curiosity among locals and draw attention to the campaign.The video shows Branson politely approaching strangers with the question, “Can I ask you a question?” But instead of engaging, people brushed him off. One woman walked by without so much as a glance, while another looked briefly at him before rushing away, clearly preoccupied with her own thoughts and errands.For a man who has conquered industries from airlines to space travel, being ignored on the sidewalk was a rare and humbling experience. Squibb, amused by the scene, remarked, “A bit of rejection is healthy.” Branson laughed at himself and replied, “I’m not doing too well, am I?” Eventually, a passerby did agree to share his dream, stating his goal was to achieve financial independence, help others, and contribute positively to the world in meaningful ways.Once uploaded, the clip drew widespread attention on social media. Many users were stunned that a man of Branson’s stature could blend so seamlessly into the crowd. One viewer commented, “Richard Branson getting rejected? Unbelievable!” Another wrote, “Imagine ignoring one of the world’s most inspirational entrepreneurs who’s just asking you a simple question.”The rejections, however, were not seen as embarrassing but rather refreshing. Viewers praised Branson’s good-natured attitude and willingness to step into unfamiliar situations despite his status. A popular comment read, “This is what humility looks like. Sir Richard Branson has every reason to stay in his comfort zone, but he still pushes himself.”","Billionaire Richard Branson ignored on NYC streets while promoting ‘Doorbell of Dreams’ The 75-year-old tycoon tried stopping passersby for quick interviews, only to be repeatedly ignored.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Police on Thursday arrested businessman Samir Modi in connection with a sexual assault case. Samir is the brother of former IPL chairman and fugitive Lalit Modi.He returned to India around 10 am on Thursday and was arrested at IGI airport after immigration officers alerted Delhi Police. The police had filed an FIR against him last month on a complaint filed by one of his employees. Samir was abroad at that time. A look-out circular was issued against him.Samir was sent to police custody for a day. The cops had sought a three-day remand in court. The officers said that they had to take him to places of the alleged occurrence of the crime and recover his mobile phone. Samir's counsel said in court that he was innocent and a victim of extortion.The FIR against Samir was filed at New Friends Colony and DCP Hemant Tiwari was heading the probe.According to police, the FIR alleges repeated instances of rape on the pretext of ""false promises"" of promotion and better employment opportunities, a senior police officer said. The complainant has claimed that she was allegedly raped at his home, office and in hotels.Samir and his family have been also embroiled in a legal battle involving the company.The feud between Samir and his family stems from disagreements over the execution of the late KK Modi's trust deed, which governs the distribution of assets among family members.Samir has accused his mother, Bina Modi, of not adhering to the deed's terms, particularly regarding the distribution of shares and funds, and has taken the legal route to counter it. The dispute has now turned into boardrooms battles, and Samir has alleged attempts to block his participation in company meetings and challenged moves to curtail his role on the board. The company, Godfrey Phillips, manufactures cigarette brands like Four Square and Red & White.Last month, a sessions court had summoned Samir in connection with defamation proceedings, setting aside a trial court order that had earlier rejected the plea and freed him of charges.The case was filed by independent directors Nirmala Bagri and Atul Gupta, who have claimed that some statements allegedly made by Samir in the media last year had tarnished their reputation.A version from Samir's counsel on the matter was unavailable despite attempts.",Samir Modi is the brother of former IPL chairman and fugitive Lalit Modi.

First-timers’ demands

Malpractice charge





NEW DELHI: The stage is set for a high-stakes showdown at Delhi University as counting of votes for the Delhi University Students’ Union (DUSU) elections begins at 8 am today inside the Multipurpose Hall at the University Sports Stadium, North Campus.After a spirited campaign marked by “clean and green elections” and the visible rise of female candidates, all eyes are now on the battle between ABVP NSUI , and the Left alliance (AISA-SFI) for the four key posts of president, vice-president, secretary, and joint secretary.Students voted in a noticeably calmer DUSU election on Thursday, although sparks flew between NSUI and ABVP over alleged poll malpractice.The Delhi University elections were for electing college and university union members. The results will be declared on Friday.Campus roads, typically strewn with discarded campaign flyers, were clean. The once-deafening noise was subdued. Voter turnout was low in the morning but picked up by noon as longer lines formed at booths. Among first-time voters there was palpable excitement.This year’s polls have seen better enforcement measures and heightened surveillance. Over 600 police personnel were deployed, strict anti-defacement curbs on campaign were imposed.Security personnel meticulously verified student ID cards at multiple barricades set up to control the crowds.The measures follow last year’s controversy when Delhi High Court halted the counting after complaints of widespread defacement of property on campuses and outside by candidates surfaced. Students were seen tossing pamphlets in the air, leaving campus roads strewn with litter.Such scenes were absent this time, barring the few handwritten pamphlets found in the streets. National Students’ Union of India (NSUI) and Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) supporters also raised counter-slogans near Ramjas College.DUSU chief election officer Raj Kishore Sharma later said that the polling was peaceful. After the voting concluded, the EVMs were placed in the strong room at the university’s sports complex multipurpose hall.This year’s voter turnout showed a slight improvement from last year, rising to 39.4% from 35.2%. The voting was in two phases — from 8.30am to 1pm and 3pm to 7.30pm. Across 52 colleges and departments, 60,272 votes were cast from among 1,53,100 voters. The numbers could increase on Friday.The university set up 700 EVMs in 195 booths. A total of 21 candidates have contested for 4 central panel posts.Keshavi, a differently-abled English Honours student at Miranda House, said: “I want change, especially better rights and inclusion for persons with disabilities”. Another student at Hindu College said that infrastructure reforms would be a major factor in deciding the vote.EVM glitches were reported at a few colleges.At Ramjas College, voting was halted for about 10 minutes after two machines developed snags. At Miranda House, one of the five machines developed a fault but it was fixed immediately. At Kirori Mal, an ink mark appearing next to a candidate’s name sparked claims of electoral manipulation.Elections for college-level unions added to the confusion on Thursday, especially for first-year students.At Miranda House, many students queued for over an hour and a half to cast their first vote. Sanvi and Shreya, friends pursuing a BA programme and both voting for the first time, said they hoped everyday issues would be addressed. “I think there can be better Wi-Fi and probably more facilities like air-conditioning in classrooms,” Sanvi said.“Everyone talks about cheaper transport. I hope these promises are fulfilled because it really matters to people like me who come from outside Delhi,” Riya, a Ramjas fresher, said.NSUI has blamed ABVP of indulging in vote manipulation. NSUI national president Varun Choudhary demanded the immediate rejection of ABVP’s presidential candidate’s nomination after alleged malpractice was reported from Kirori Mal, Hindu and Hansraj Colleges. “The students will not tolerate this. They will answer ABVP’s dishonesty with their vote,” he said.“I have been to Hansraj and Kirori Mal, and on every EVM machine, a blue ink mark is placed in front of Aryan Maan (ABVP). Open vote tampering is happening,” NSUI president Joslyn Nandita Choudhary wrote on X in Hindi. Outgoing DUSU president from NSUI, Ronak Khatri, filed a police complaint alleging that ABVP had engaged in vote tampering.ABVP rejected the claim, terming it the “frustration” of NSUI. ABVP national general secretary Virendra Singh Solanki said: “NSUI is rattled by ABVP’s growing popularity and is resorting to making unfounded allegations. The CCTV footage should be reviewed. It will expose the lies of NSUI.”ABVP Delhi state secretary Sarthak Sharma said: “Just as Congress blames EVMs after each loss, NSUI is following the same path.”Some ABVP members accused Khatri of storming into Kirori Mal with outsiders, causing injuries to students.","The counting of votes for the Delhi University Students’ Union (DUSU) elections begins at 8 am today inside the Multipurpose Hall at the University Sports Stadium, North Campus.

With the help of bystanders, he rushed the victim to LBS Hospital,"" said a senior police officer.DCP (East) Abhishek Dhania said, ""The car's owner has been identified as Shakil Ahmed, a resident of Friends Colony, who is currently out of the city."" An FIR has been registered under Sections 281 (rash driving or riding on a public way) and 106 (causing death by negligence) at Pandav Nagar police station.Agarwal ran a douna pattal (plates and bowls made from leaves or other material) manufacturing unit in Badarpur. He is survived by his wife and two daughters in their twenties - one pursuing a medical career and the other in engineering.Outside the mortuary at LBS Hospital, Agarwal's wife, Hemlata, sat in shock, her face streaked with tears, while relatives and colleagues tried to comfort her. Through her wails of grief, she cried, ""He's gone...what words do I have left?"" Locals said, after hearing a loud crash, people rushed to the accident site and found a helmet and broken pieces of the scooter lying close to the victim.The service road and flyover, familiar routes for countless daily commuters, are lined with shops and residential buildings that usually rest quietly at night.

NUH: The corridors of the Nuh mini secretariat are filled with anxious faces and restless footsteps. Men in kurta-pajamas, office shirts and funky T-shirts clutch on to their bank passbooks and folders, waiting for a chance to plead their case.Each is hoping for the same outcome — to reclaim access to their own money, now locked away in frozen accounts.Ajruddin, a local shopkeeper , summed up the frustration shared by many others . ""My EMI was deducted the moment Rs 73,000 landed in my wallet. Now, all my accounts are blocked. Now, how will I pay my suppliers this week,"" he sought to know, holding up a stack of receipts.For Sahwan, a 29-year-old PhD scholar from Jamia Millia Islamia, the sum that triggered the account freeze was just Rs 1.47. ""Yet my bank account, which I use for paying rent and daily expenses, is blocked. Nobody is telling us when it will reopen,"" he said.Iqbal, a meat shop owner, found himself caught in the web after a customer scanned his shop's QR code and paid Rs 1,200. ""I thought that it was a normal sale. I transferred the money to my account. Now, my shop's main account is frozen,"" he told TOI.For many, the crisis has been compounded by the fact that their digital wallets are linked to multiple bank accounts. Even if one of them is flagged in case of a potential cyber fraud , all the associated accounts are blocked, leaving entire families unable to access their savings.This wave of distress began earlier this month, when a major fraud was discovered involving MobiKwik, a Gurgaon-based digital wallet company. A technical glitch in the app allowed users to transfer money even if their wallet balance was insufficient or if they had entered an incorrect PIN. Exploiting this loophole, thousands of transactions were carried out, resulting in losses of more than Rs 40 crore.Probe quickly led the cops to Nuh, where a significant number of beneficiaries were traced. So far, six persons have been arrested, with over Rs 9 lakh recovered from their accounts. Authorities have blocked around 2,500 such accounts that received suspicious transfers.Raids are also being carried out in Nuh, Palwal, and Faridabad to follow the money trail.Most of those caught up in the freeze are ordinary villagers who suddenly saw unexpected funds appear in their digital wallets. Some transferred the money to their bank accounts, others used it to pay bills or loans. Now, all find themselves under scrutiny, unable to access their own savings. Adding to their woes is the paperwork demanded by MobiKwik.Company representatives are asking users to submit Aadhaar cards, bank statements, affidavits, and a ""shapat patra""— an oath letter declaring their innocence and cooperation with the investigation.The process has left many uneasy. ""What if I sign and they still don't unblock my account. Or worse, what if police arrest me,"" a man asked TOI. Others worried about the cost of legal paperwork when their accounts were already frozen.By midday, the queue outside room number 428 had snaked down the corridor. Some men scrolled through their phones, others debated quietly, while the elderly sat silently, staring at the closed door.Social worker Hidayat Khan tried to reassure the crowd. ""This is not fraud by the people. It was a company failure, a glitch. The people of Nuh are innocent. They should not panic — bring bank statements, submit them, and cooperate. That is the way forward,"" he told them.But for those trapped in the bureaucratic maze, such words offered little comfort. ""We are not criminals. We only want our accounts back,"" a senior citizen said.MobiKwik, in a statement, confirmed that a technical issue on Sept 11 and 12 led to failed transactions being marked as successful, resulting in unauthorised payouts to some merchants in and around Nuh.""A few merchants and users from this area exploited this issue to gain undue financial benefit,"" the company said. They asserted it was not a cybersecurity breach, but an internal processing error that had been resolved.""No banks or financial institutions were affected. MobiKwik has strengthened its monitoring systems and implemented additional control measures. The app is 100% safe and secure for all digital payments,"" the statement added.","A major fraud was discovered involving MobiKwik, a Gurgaon-based digital wallet company.

The world’s most successful entrepreneurs often captivate us with their business acumen, vision, and relentless drive, but there’s one factor in the early lives of Steve Jobs Jeff Bezos , and Larry Ellison that many people overlook: they were all adopted. Steve Jobs, the Apple co-founder, Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon , and Larry Ellison, the Oracle co-founder, each grew up in adoptive families that provided stability and guidance. While adoption is not the sole reason for their extraordinary achievements, it may have shaped their resilience, ambition, and determination to succeed against the odds. These stories offer a glimpse into the unknown early lives of billionaires.Steve Jobs was born to Abdulfattah Jandali, a Syrian student pursuing a PhD, and Joanne Schieble, an American Catholic of Swiss-German descent. Because Joanne’s parents opposed the relationship and pregnancy, she opted for a closed adoption. The couple originally selected to adopt Jobs backed out after learning the baby was a boy. He was eventually adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs, a working-class couple who promised to save for his college education. Jobs was fiercely loyal to his adoptive parents, viewing them as his true family. Throughout his life, he often referred to his biological parents as “my sperm and egg bank.” The nurturing environment provided by Paul and Clara helped cultivate his creativity, curiosity, and relentless pursuit of innovation, which later defined his career at Apple and Pixar.Born Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen, Jeff Bezos experienced early family instability. His teenage mother, Jacklyn, divorced his biological father when Jeff was just 17 months old, leaving her to raise him alone under difficult circumstances. At age four, Jacklyn married Miguel “Mike” Bezos, a Cuban immigrant who adopted Jeff and gave him the surname Bezos. Mike Bezos became a guiding force in Jeff’s life, instilling discipline, a strong work ethic, and a love for learning. Jeff has often credited Mike for providing the stability and support that allowed him to explore his interests in science, technology, and entrepreneurship. The adoption offered him a second chance at a stable family environment, which may have contributed to the resilience and strategic thinking that later fueled the creation of Amazon.Larry Ellison’s early life was marked by health and family challenges. Born in New York City to a 19-year-old single mother, he contracted pneumonia as an infant. His mother made the difficult decision to give him up for adoption, and he was taken in by his mother’s aunt and uncle, Lillian and Louis Ellison, in Chicago. Larry was aware of being adopted but fully grasped the reality at age 12. Lillian provided warmth and nurturing, while Louis was often stern and distant, creating a complex family dynamic. Growing up in modest circumstances on Chicago’s South Side, Ellison developed a sense of independence, ambition, and self-reliance that would later drive his success at Oracle. He only met his biological mother at age 48, which reinforced the sense of self-made achievement that characterizes his public persona.Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy’s, also had an adoption story that shaped his values and vision. Born Rex David Thomas, he was adopted as an infant by Rex and Auleva Thomas in New Jersey. Despite losing his adoptive mother at age five and facing further family losses, he developed resilience and empathy. His early experiences inspired him to advocate for adoption later in life, leading to the creation of the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption, which helps children in foster care find permanent homes. Dave’s story demonstrates how adoption, combined with love and support, can nurture determination, compassion, and a lifelong commitment to giving back.","Steve Jobs, the Apple co-founder, Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, and Larry Ellison all grew up in adoptive families.

Why India?

Doubts And Concerns

Are We There, Yet?

THE GCC TRIANGLE: MUMBAI, BENGALURU, HYDERABAD

India’s first pharma GCC, of Novartis, opened in Mumbai in 2001. But Bengaluru leads the pack now with 33% of these GCCs based there. The city making waves now is Hyderabad. Post Covid, practically every GCC that has opened in India has come up in the Telangana capital.

The more than 55 pharma GCCs that employ over 3 lakh professionals mainly operate out of these three cities, which together account for nearly 75% of the total installed sectoral talent, according to GCC enabler ANSR.

Novartis’s move to Hyderabad’s new IT district has worked as a magnet, bringing the likes of BMS, Sanofi, Eli Lilly, Bayer, Evernorth, Medtronic, Providence, among others, to the city, which houses GCCs of eight of the top 10 global pharma companies.

India is already called the ‘pharmacy of the world’ for manufacturing quality and affordable medicines. To be counted as a drugs powerhouse, it has to now find a way to move up the value chain. Whatever the approach, if pharma GCCs, or global capability centres, located in the country appear vital to the journey, it’s because they’ve come a long way themselves.Over 55 healthcare & lifesciences (H&LS) GCCs are now present in India, operating over 95 centres spread across mainly Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Mumbai. Together, they represent millions of dollars in investment and lakhs of roles, including ones increasingly in research and drug development. Among those who’ve trooped in are as many as 23 of the world’s top 50 life sciences companies. While about half of these made their entry only over the last five years (according to a recent EY India report), it’s a story that begins almost a quarter century back.2001. Just after the turn of the millennium, when India was basking in the success of its Y2K moment that heralded its arrival on the global IT stage, pharma giant Novartis planted the seed of what would become the next big offshoring story for India.The Swiss company put together a modest 20-member team in Mumbai to test the waters for building capabilities in data management, statistics and IT.Cut to 2025, and Novartis Corporate Centre (NCC) India is the largest pharma GCC in the country. In between came a move to Hyderabad in 2007-08 and investments of more than $400 million. NCC India now houses over 8,500 employees, including around 2,800 people in development across Hyderabad and Mumbai. Ganpat Anchaliya, head of NCC India, says “foresight and conviction” led them to act “well ahead of peers”. But it didn’t take very long for others to follow.As EY points out, what started as a trickle in the 2000s with pharma giants Novartis, Johnson & Johnson, and Novo Nordisk gathered pace in the mid-2010s as Eli Lilly, Merck KGaA and Bayer headed to Indian shores. Post Covid-19, this momentum has only accelerated, with pharma MNCs gearing up for a coming decade of uncertainty, high competition and increasing regulatory scrutiny.India, experts say, has become crucial for big pharma as the industry stares at a $236 billion patent cliff between 2025 and 2030, when nearly 70 blockbuster drugs go off patent.“India combines three strengths that are rare to find in one location — sheer scale that gives it global relevance, talent, and impact,” says John Dawber, corporate VP & MD of global business services at Danish giant Novo Nordisk.If India’s large pool of scientific, medical, and digital talent — more than 2.7 million professionals in life sciences and a strong pipeline of over 2 million STEM graduates annually — is virtually unmatched, it has also succeeded in leveraging other strengths.Anil Matai, director general of the Organisation of Pharmaceutical Producers of India (OPPI), says what makes India unique is its positioning at the convergence of world-class scientific talent, robust digital infrastructure and a thriving innovation mindset. “Earlier it was a generic copycat mindset but, now, the mindset is also changing and we see the scales tilting towards innovation. Also, for global clinical trials, we have a large patient pool as well,” says Matai, who was at the helm of Novartis India when its GCC moved to Hyderabad.Sairam Nair, lead, GCC, and country president, Sandoz India, sees the pharma GCC boom as the result of a unique blend of cost efficiency, deep domain expertise, mature operating environment, and a tech- and AI-native talent pool. But not all are convinced.Some feel that though GCCs have achieved much, especially in scaling talent, they are yet to do any fundamental innovation in India.“They (GCCs) are largely back offices for global innovators, who moved the routine work here first and now are adding more layers to it. But I still don’t think they’re doing fundamental innovation here. I look forward to the day when the core of innovation shifts here and they become innovation centres in drug discovery,” says G V Prasad, cochairman & managing director, Dr Reddy’s Labs.Shiv Kumar, HR head of Merck India, agrees that “from a drug discovery perspective, I think we have some way to go”, but his diagnosis of the problem is different. “Let’s be honest, I think IP (intellectual property) laws in India, while they are evolving, haven’t evolved to a point where there is a lot of confidence,” he feels.Matai of OPPI does not see it that way — he says a few GCCs have even begun investing in basic research in India — but acknowledges IP issues. “While IP protection has improved, some concerns remain about enforcement and regulatory data protection, which can affect willingness to invest in basic research.” India, Matai says, needs to build on innovation atop its strong foundation of generics, but much will depend on how much comfort Indian regulators are able to provide to MNCs. “If they provide comfort now, then, in the next five to 10 years, you will see significant investment.”However, Arindam Sen, partner and GCC sector lead, EY India, insists that the shift from cost arbitrage to capabilityarbitrage is real and irreversible. “This isn’t about cost arbitrage anymore, it’s about India becoming indispensable to the global R&D pipeline. Life sciences MNCs are embedding their most strategic, knowledge-intensive work here, making India the epicentre for life sciences innovation, compliance, and future growth. ”Tech ForwardThe shift in approach is already visible in scale and scope with the next leap almost certain to be powered by artificial intelligence (AI).“Early pilots in Indian GCCs are already showing what’s possible: AI-based molecule triaging that saves up to nine months in discovery cycles, predictive safety systems in pharmacovigilance, and machine-learning models that optimise clinical trial design,” says pharma expert Sujesh Vasudevan, a senior adviser at BCG.“Novartis in Hyderabad is applying AI to anticipate drug safety outcomes, while AstraZeneca is deploying machine learning to identify novel cancer drug targets. Reports suggest that such models can reduce discovery costs by as much as 70% while cutting timelines by nearly in half. For global pharma, India’s GCCs now offer not just scale but speed, insight, and innovation,” he adds.The AI pivot is already at work. “Our hub in Hyderabad integrates cutting-edge tech like AI, machine learning, and software engineering to accelerate drug discovery, optimise clinical trial processes, and generate actionable market insights,” says Pranab Kakati, head of data solution implementation services, data science & AI, Bayer Pharmaceuticals Private Ltd. Nair of Sandoz GCC says they’re “exploring smarter, practical ways to integrate AI into operations to deliver impact that’s both meaningful and sustainable”.According to Bhanu Prakash Kalmath SJ, partner and healthcare industry leader, Grant Thornton Bharat, the infusion of AI, particularly in knowledge- and data-intensive processes, is expected to further deepen the transformation and enhance Indian GCCs’ role in global innovation.Attesting to this, Anchaliya of Novartis says their over 8,500 associates anchored in Hyderabad are not only advancing scientific, digital insights, and tech frontiers but also shaping how the company operates globally.Matai of OPPI, which represents research-based global pharmaceutical MNCs in India, says “the shift has been dramatic in the last few years”.“While it was more about cost optimisation in the early days, the needle has moved significantly and, now, a lot of highend work is getting done here. Today, we have 16 member companies that have set up GCCs in India,” he says.Matai says that while “(Novartis) were the early ones to spot the opportunity”, EY India’s Sen sought to underline the sector’s rapid evolution. “In just five years, GCC penetration in enabling functions like finance, HR, supply chain, and IT has crossed the 60% mark, but what truly stands out is their deepening role in core functions — from drug discovery and regulatory affairs to medical and commercial operations,” he says.India’s first GCC started with a 20-member team in Mumbai in 2001 and also set up in Hyderabad in 2007-08 with an investment of more than $400 million coming over the past two decades. India’s largest pharma GCC, it has over 8,500 employees.Set up in 2019, its GCC has grown to over 3,000 people in Hyderabad. Investments worth €400-million are lined up till 2030 for its GCC, which is driving high-value functions like drug discovery and digital health innovation. Mrinal Duggal, head, Sanofi Global Hub in Hyderabad, said “the Hyderabad hub has become integral to Sanofi’s mission”.It invested $100 million to open its innovation hub in Hyderabad in 2024 with over 1,500 employees. It’s focussing on applying AI to drug discovery, speeding up clinical trials and regulatory documentation through automation.Its Bengaluru hub, conceived in 2007, has grown to around 4,500 professionals spanning 17 functions that support everything from early R&D to supply-chain planning. John Dawber, corporate VP & MD of its global business services, said the India hub is leveraging public-private partnerships and advances in AI and automation to enable Novo Nordisk “to accelerate innovation and deliver better outcomes globally”.Started with around 65 employees in 2016 in Bengaluru and has grown to 3,500 people. It recently expanded to Hyderabad,where 1,500 roles are planned. The Bengaluru site plays a key role, among other things, in streamlining clinical trials and drug development. The Hyderabad site will leverage AI, automation, cloud computing, etc.The German giant started its India GCC journey with the acquisition of Sigma Aldrich in 2015. It has grown to three GCCs housing around 2,500 people in Bengaluru. Suneela Thatte, VP & head, healthcare R&D for India, said the “vision is to keep going up the value chain... to see how we get more technical and strategic roles to India”.PfizerIts global drug development centre in Chennai, embedded in IIT Madras Research Park, employs over 250 scientists to deliver advanced APIs, formulations, and devices to global markets.Has steadily expanded from Chennai to a 166-crore global hub in Bengaluru, focused on AI-driven drug discovery and digital health.The generics giants, which was spun off from Novartis in late 2023, started with just 800 employees and has grown to over 1,000 people in Hyderabad.Came in over a decade ago, but has remained compact by extensively leveraging their partner ecosystem. Its Hyderabad facility is a critical hub for pharma R&D and clinical trial operations focused on advancing oncology and cardiology therapeutics.","India’s first pharma GCC, of Novartis, opened in Mumbai in 2001.

'No one can threaten or blackmail the govt'

Wider debate





NEW DELHI: Bengaluru-based logistics firm BlackBuck has denied speculation that it is leaving the city, after a post by its CEO triggered debate about infrastructure and corporate relocation.Rajesh Yabaji, CEO and co-founder of BlackBuck, clarified on Thursday that the company was not moving out of Bengaluru, but shifting offices within the city to reduce employee commute.In a post on X, he described Bengaluru as “home” and credited the Outer Ring Road (ORR) corridor and Karnataka’s tech ecosystem for supporting BlackBuck’s growth since its beginnings in a small Koramangala office in 2015. He added that while parts of its operations would continue on ORR, the firm was committed to expanding in the city and working with local government.The clarification came after widespread media reports suggested that BlackBuck was preparing to leave the ORR-Bellandur area, citing poor road conditions.The speculation prompted a sharp reaction from Karnataka’s deputy chief minister, D K Shivakumar, who is also Bengaluru’s development minister.“No one can threaten or blackmail the govt. I will not stop anyone from going,” he told reporters, in response to reports of firms considering relocation.He added, “I wish them all the good luck. If they are not satisfied with manpower, talent, or facilities, I cannot stop them, but no one can threaten the govt – I am telling you this.”Shivakumar insisted that Bengaluru remained unmatched as a business hub. “No one will go out of Bengaluru for infrastructure reasons. If they do, it will be due to business or financial problems. Blackmailing the govt will not help. Let them go wherever they want — no city can match Bengaluru.”The minister pointed to recent changes in civic governance, including the creation of the Greater Bengaluru Authority, which has split the city into five corporations and 198 wards to cope with population pressures. He acknowledged challenges in areas such as Mahadevapura, where “some localities fall under corporation limits, others don’t.”The row has sparked debate in India’s tech capital, where several company leaders and start-up founders have complained about worsening road conditions in the ORR–Mahadevapura stretch.Adding to the controversy, Andhra Pradesh IT minister Nara Lokesh publicly invited BlackBuck to shift its base to Visakhapatnam. On X, he contrasted his state’s approach with Karnataka’s, writing: “Here is what sets AP apart from others — we don’t dismiss our people’s genuine grievances as ‘blackmail’. We treat them with the dignity and seriousness they deserve.”BlackBuck, however, has reiterated its long-term commitment to Bengaluru. “We’re only relocating within the city to a different location, which will facilitate an easy commute for our employees,” the company said in a statement.","Bengaluru-based logistics firm BlackBuck has denied speculation that it is leaving the city.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.
