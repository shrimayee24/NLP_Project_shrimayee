'Pakistani abroad often use Indian names to hide identity'



'IMF must see how its loans to Pakistan are being used'



'Opium was trafficked from Pakistan into Punjab'



'Pakistan has to be called out for atrocities'



NEW DELHI: Former minister of state for external affairs MJ Akbar, part of the all-party delegation led by BJP MP Ravi Shankar Prasad, strongly criticised Pakistan during an address to the Indian diaspora in Copenhagen on Saturday.Calling Pakistan a ""double-faced"" nation, Akbar questioned, “Which face do we talk to?” He described Pakistan’s government as having a ""forked tongue"" and said its approach to dialogue is nothing but a “bluff.”Speaking at the event, Akbar declared, ""Even well-meaning friends will ask you, why don't you talk to Pakistan? Tell them Pakistan has a government with a double face, which face do we talk to? Pakistan has a government with a forked tongue; whose tongue do we address?""""Pakistan talks with a poisoned tongue that gets hurt when a tongue is poisoned. The talks are nothing but a bluff. We now have a leader who has actually called the bluff, Narendra Modi... Nobody has made as much effort to bring a nation with a genetic disorder to its senses,"" he added.The delegation led by Ravi Shankar Prasad, includes BJP MP Daggubati Purandeswari, Samik Bhattacharya, Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi, Congress MPs Ghulam Ali Khatana and Amar Singh, former Union Minister MJ Akbar, and Ambassador Pankaj Saran.Akbar further referred to the recent Pahalgam terror attack and drew comparisons with instances of communal terrorism in Europe.""The recent Pahalgam terror attack was a brutal form, barbaric form of communal terrorism of the kind that Europe had also witnessed...The remarks that they made were enough to show that the mission that the delegation Prime Minister has sent is having an impact,"" Akbar noted.Further, addressing the Indian diaspora, BJP MP Samik Bhattacharya said the delegation’s main goal was to raise global awareness about terrorism. He also pointed out that many Pakistani businesses abroad often avoid revealing their Pakistani identity.""We are not seeking help from anyone with folded hands. We are going everywhere in the world - and we have only one objective: to alert them that what is happening with us is bound to happen with them. Hence, this terrorism must be uprooted. Every Pakistani knows what they are; they can't even open a shop in the name of Pakistan outside their country, they use Indian names, Bhattacharya said.Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi emphasised Indian unity against Pakistan, referencing her party's historical stance.She said, ""I am from the same Shiv Sena that dug up the cricket pitch to not allow Pakistan to play a cricket match in India and with the same commitment, I'm part of the joint delegation that has come from all political parties to say that as Indians we stand one and nobody can divide us.""Chaturvedi additionally questioned the IMF's decision to provide financial aid to Pakistan, suggesting the funds were misdirected to Pakistani disruptors outside the venue. ""As we were coming here, we saw some flags, and you all would know what those flags are. And I thought to myself, the IMF loan is coming in handy, and I hope those who are giving them the IMF loan realise what it's being used for,"" she added.During the event, Manish Prabhat, India's Ambassador to Denmark, addressed anti-India protests by a small group outside the venue where the Indian parliamentary delegation was present. Criticising the protesters, Prabhat said, ""This community is unlike the community, a representation of which you saw outside on the street. And we know that how much amount they have been paid to put their duty here.""He commended the Indian diaspora in Denmark for their constructive contributions and successful cultural assimilation.Congress MP Amar Singh expressed apprehension regarding Pakistan's role in cross-border terrorism and drug trafficking activities. He called for unity amongst Indians when dealing with such external challenges.""In Punjab, especially after 1971, what happened was that opium was used to be sent from Pakistan. Punjab is the centre in North India for transporting drugs to Delhi and other parts of India. And I'm an eyewitness to those things. As a child, as a school student, then college student, and now for the last eight to ten years, again, as an eyewitness, that drugs and weapons are coming through drones,"" he said.He noted the recent recovery of numerous drones carrying narcotics and weapons in Punjab's border villages. Discussing previous terror incidents, he stated ""When we know the reality that our neighbouring country, Pakistan, is doing this thing, how can we be quiet on this issue? And this issue has to be shared, and we all want to share with the international community that the issue of terrorism is now very serious. And in India, you will all remember Mumbai and then Pulwama, Uri, Pathankot and now Pahalgam. We all have to be united, oppose it. Terrorism is bad. Drugs are bad, weapons are bad, it damages the society.""Earlier on Friday, former Danish Ambassador to India Freddy Svane praised the delegation's efforts to raise global awareness about terrorism. He supported their initiative to communicate the importance of unified action against terror.Svane backed India's position regarding Pakistan, emphasising the necessity for joint action against terrorism, stating ""Pakistan has to be called out for atrocities."" Speaking to ANI, Svane said, ""We have this all-party delegation visiting Denmark is just really securing that we not only are listening but we also talk and we have a dialogue, and now it's time for us to stand shoulder to shoulder to take action.""The Indian delegation in Copenhagen during the visit engaged with several former Danish MPs, including Freddy Svane (former Danish ambassador to India), Manu Sareen, Helle Degn (vice president of the Mandela Center), and Niels Ahlmann-Ohlsen (now CEO of Strategic Alliance International ApS). The discussions aimed to boost bilateral relations and promote mutual cooperation.During their visit, the delegation also met with Christian Friis Bach, Chairperson of the Danish Parliament's Foreign Policy Committee, and Danish MP Trine Pertou Mach. The group also attended a luncheon interaction hosted by the Indian Ambassador, where they exchanged ideas with former Danish parliamentarians.","Former minister of state for external affairs MJ Akbar strongly criticised Pakistan during an address to the Indian diaspora in Copenhagen on Saturday.

Amul's widely publicised launch of ""India's first liquid infant formula"" has outraged activists who have complained to the government that it is a violation of the Infant Milk Substitutes (IMS) Act. The Act prohibits the promotion of any breastmilk substitute meant for children below two years of age.The launch of Amul's liquid ready-to-feed infant milk substitute and its coverage in the media highlighted its convenience, particularly describing it as ""ideal to carry"" and ""good for working mothers"". ""Such framing directly positions the product as a substitute for breastfeeding and this action as promotion,"" argued public health activists who have complained to the secretaries of the women and child development ministry, the health ministry, the CEO of the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), and chairperson of the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights.In response to the objections, Amul tweeted: ""Amulspray is one of India's oldest and most trusted infant milk food brands and is in complete compliance of the IMS Act..."".Public health advocates argued that Amul's actions constitute a clear case of promotion of an infant milk substitute - an act explicitly prohibited under Section 3(c) of the IMS Act, which states: ""No person shall... take part in the promotion of infant milk substitutes, feeding bottles or infant foods"".The law also prohibits having any pictures or other graphic material or phrases designed to increase the saleability of infant milk substitute or infant food. Amul's use of a teddy bear graphic on the product's label could be considered a breach of this provision, they stated.The complaint has demanded an enquiry into the launch and promotion of Amul's product, immediate removal of the graphic of a teddy bear from the product label, media guidelines for IMS-compliant reporting and strong enforcement of the IMS Act.","Amul's widely publicised launch of ""India's first liquid infant formula"" has outraged activists.

Advantage taxpayers

New ITR Forms FY 2024-25

New ITR Filing Deadline FY 2024-25: In a major relief to taxpayers, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has extended the deadline for filing Income Tax Returns (ITRs) for the assessment year 2025–26. Returns originally due by July 31, 2025, can now be filed until September 15, 2025.The extension comes amid significant revisions in ITR forms, ongoing system development, and the need for accurate reflection of TDS credits.""CBDT has decided to extend the due date of filing of ITRs, which are due for filing by 31st July 2025, to 15th September 2025 This extension will provide more time due to significant revisions in ITR forms, system development needs, and TDS credit reflections. This ensures a smoother and more accurate filing experience for everyone. Formal notification will follow."" Income Tax Department, Government of India posted on X.According to CBDT, the notified ITRS for AY 2025-26 have undergone structural and content revisions aimed at simplifying compliance, enhancing transparency, and enabling accurate reporting. These changes have necessitated additional time for system development, integration, and testing of the corresponding utilities.Furthermore, credits arising from TDS statements, due for filing by 31st May 2025, are expected to begin reflecting in early June, limiting the effective window for return filing in the absence of such extension.""In view of the extensive changes introduced in the notified ITRs and considering the time required for system readiness and rollout of Income Tax Return (ITR) utilities for Assessment Year (AY) 2025-26, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has decided to extend the due date for filing returns. Accordingly, to facilitate a smooth and convenient filing experience for taxpayers, it has been decided that the due date for filing of ITRS, originally due on 31st July 2025, is extended to 15th September 2025. "" CBDT release stated.A formal notification reflecting the new deadline will be issued separately, said V. Rajitha, Commissioner of Income Tax (Media & Technical Policy) and Official Spokesperson for CBDT.""This extension is expected to mitigate the concerns raised by stakeholders and provide adequate time for compliance, thereby ensuring the integrity and accuracy of the return filing process."" CBDT added.Parizad Sirwalla, Partner and Head, Global Mobility Services, Tax, KPMG in India tells TOI, “Changes in the tax law in the past year and additional disclosure as well as other updates to the tax return form for Financial Year (FY) 2024-25 have necessitated additional time for updating the technology for the tax department. This will entail revising the tax filing utility on the income tax portal as well. Hence, extending the deadline to file the income tax returns for FY 24-25 by almost one and a half months from 31 July 2025 to 15 September 2025 is in line with the expectations. This extension aims to enhance the taxpayer experience by providing requisite time to file returns once the TDS credits are appropriately reflecting in taxpayers Form 26AS and AIS/ TIS following the submission of TDS statements by employers/ deductors of TDS due by May 31, 2025.“Nonetheless, it is in the taxpayers' best interest to file their returns as soon as the filing utility is made available to avoid additional interest costs where tax payments are due or to allow department time to process the returns at the earliest where refunds are due,” she adds.Sonu Iyer, Partner and National Leader, People Advisory Services-Tax, EY India explains, “The ITR forms notified for the FY 2024-25 (AY 2025-26) incorporate the amendments introduced by the Finance Act 2024 and have enhanced reporting requirements relating to deductions being claimed, requirement to report TDS section codes, provide the bifurcation of capital gains for pre and post 23 July 2024, etc. If you recall, Finance Act 2024 has rationalized capital gains taxation on specific transactions on or after 23 July 2024. ”“Given the requirements of these new ITR forms, the e-filing utility (both online and offline) needs to be updated by the Government. Therefore, it is a very welcome move from the government to extend the ITR filing deadline from 31 July 2025 to 15 Sep 2025, allowing taxpayers the time required to comply with these enhanced reporting requirements and legislative changes,” she adds.As per CA Ashish Niraj, Partner at A S N & Company, Chartered Accountants: “This extension was very much awaited by Income Tax professionals and taxpayers, as the Income Tax portal had not yet enabled the filing of ITRs on its portal till May 27, 2025. Normally, July 31 is due date for the category of taxpayers whose accounts are not required to be audited. As the due date was approaching, professionals and taxpayers were tense about how they would prepare and file returns in such a short span of time once the portal allowed ITR filing. There were issues in fetching proper AIS data and TDS data in some cases. All these are required to be reconciled to file error-free returns. Even AIS is not getting fetched properly in many cases. Now that the ITR due date has been extended, taxpayers will get enough time to prepare returns, compare with AIS, 26AS, etc., to avoid mismatches and file them accurately. It’s really a welcome decision.”Meanwhile, the Income Tax Department has notified all seven ITR forms for AY 2025–26, incorporating structural updates and simplifications. ITR-1 (Sahaj) is meant for resident individuals with income up to Rs 50 lakh from salary, one house property, other sources (like interest), and agricultural income up to Rs 5,000. A key update now allows salaried individuals to report long-term capital gains (LTCG) up to Rs 1.25 lakh under ITR-1, which was earlier not permitted.ITR-2 applies to individuals and Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs) who do not have income from business or profession but have income from capital gains. A new requirement mandates reporting capital gains separately based on whether they arose before or after July 23, 2024, due to changes in LTCG tax treatment introduced in the 2024 Union Budget.ITR-3 is for individuals and HUFs with income from business or profession. It now features an increased reporting threshold under Schedule AL (Assets and Liabilities)—from Rs 50 lakh to Rs 1 crore—reducing compliance for middle-income taxpayers.ITR-4 (Sugam) is designed for individuals, HUFs, and firms (excluding LLPs) with total income up to Rs 50 lakh who opt for presumptive taxation under sections 44AD, 44ADA, or 44AE. It too now permits reporting of LTCG up to Rs 1.25 lakh, providing relief to small taxpayers with limited capital gains.ITR-5 is meant for firms, LLPs, AOPs, BOIs, and co-operative societies, while ITR-6 is applicable to companies, excluding those claiming exemption under section 11. Both these forms include changes in the capital gains schedule in line with the revised tax rules post-July 2024.Lastly, ITR-7 is for trusts and charitable institutions required to file returns under sections 139(4A), 139(4B), 139(4C), and 139(4D).","The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has extended the deadline for filing Income Tax Returns (ITRs) for the assessment year 2025–26. Returns originally due by July 31, 2025, can now be filed until September 15, 2025. This extension will provide more time due to significant revisions in ITR forms, system development needs, and TDS credit reflections.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121438242,imgsize-1565741,width-400,resizemode-4/121438242.jpg"

India is actively engaging with manufacturers from the UK, France, and Japan to co-develop fighter jet engines, broadening its defense ties beyond the US as it faces mounting security challenges and looks to shore up its indigenous aerospace capabilities, a Bloomberg report said. Senior officials told Bloomberg that the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) will evaluate these proposals, with the aim to start the project swiftly.The countries in talks-UK’s Rolls-Royce, France’s Safran, and an undisclosed Japanese partner-are all offering technology transfers and potential co-production arrangements, according to people familiar with the matter. Rolls-Royce offered to jointly produce and transfer technology to India during a visit by senior defense ministry officials to the UK in April, while Safran is reportedly open to sharing intellectual property rights, the Bloomberg report said.India’s push to diversify its fighter jet engine partnerships signals a strategic rebalancing in its defense policy. For decades, India’s defense ties leaned heavily on Russian suppliers, with growing partnerships with the US in the past decade. However, India’s decision to explore new partners highlights a shift: an urgent focus on reliability, supply chain security, and technological self-sufficiency amid global uncertainties.Air Chief Marshal A P Singh warned at an industry event on Thursday that delays in acquiring critical weapons “pose a serious challenge to national defense readiness,” adding bluntly, “Not for a single project that I can think of that has been completed on time.” His remarks underscore why India is moving beyond a single-source approach, especially after penalties were imposed on General Electric for delivery delays on engines that power India’s locally-made Tejas light combat jets.India’s military modernization push has been a long time coming, with delays plaguing every step of the way. Singh’s remarks-“once a timeline is given… not a single project that I can think of has been completed on time”-reflect growing impatience within India’s defense establishment.State-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) has faced flak for delays in delivering Tejas Mark-1A jets, forcing the government to pivot to private sector involvement to speed things up. The new execution model for the AMCA is a radical shift, designed to harness private innovation and global expertise while ending HAL’s monopoly on fighter production.India’s ambition is to power its twin-engine fifth-generation fighter jets-currently under the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA) project-with engines co-developed or built domestically in collaboration with global partners. The AMCA program is part of India’s larger vision to modernize its aging, largely Russian-made air force fleet and reduce dependence on foreign suppliers.Defense minister Rajnath Singh has approved a new “execution model” for the AMCA, which for the first time allows private sector firms to bid for the project alongside the HAL. Officials say the Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA), which is leading the project, will soon issue an expression of interest to domestic and international players.The project’s significance is clear: China’s rapidly advancing J-20 and rumored sixth-generation jets have raised alarm bells in Delhi. Meanwhile, Pakistan is set to acquire at least 40 Chinese J-35A fifth-generation fighters. With only 30 active fighter squadrons against an authorized strength of 42, India needs to catch up-and quickly.Michael Rubin, a South Asia analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, described India’s drive as part of a “broader effort to secure the supply chain for critical defense equipment.” He noted that the “military lesson from Ukraine’s war has been clear: self-sufficiency and reliable partnerships are paramount.”Meanwhile, Air Chief Marshal A P Singh emphasized in his CII Business Summit remarks, “We need to quickly get our act together… while design in India continues to produce results in the near future or maybe later, what is required today is required today.”India’s defense collaborations are moving from traditional vendor relationships to true joint development. Rolls-Royce, for example, offered to share cutting-edge engine technology, while Safran has expressed willingness to co-create intellectual property within India-key for India’s ambitions to be more than just an assembly hub.Japan, too, has signaled openness to deeper defense industrial ties, aligning with India’s vision of a broader Indo-Pacific security network. Defence minister Rajnath Singh held talks in May with his Japanese counterpart, exploring potential collaborations in tank and aero engine development.These moves do not indicate a cooling of India-US ties-joint manufacturing of GE’s F414 engines is still a cornerstone of Indo-US defense cooperation. But delays in that deal have prompted India to cast a wider net, underscoring that while Washington remains a top partner, India wants alternatives to hedge against risks.Indeed, India’s engagement with the UK, France, and Japan is about more than just hardware-it’s about building strategic resilience in the defense sector. A senior official involved in the negotiations said the goal is not to sideline US defense ties but “to ensure we have multiple options, as this is about national security.”India aims to finalize the AMCA’s prototype phase by developing five aircraft before moving to series production.For the first two AMCA squadrons, India will rely on the US-made GE F414 engines. But for the remaining five squadrons-over 100 jets-it wants more powerful 110-kilonewton engines built with technology partners outside the US, according to officials.India’s broader defense transformation, its AMCA program, and its engagement with multiple global players highlight a fundamental truth: for New Delhi, defense self-reliance and resilient supply chains are no longer optional-they are non-negotiable in a rapidly changing world.","India is actively engaging with manufacturers from the UK, France, and Japan to co-develop fighter jet engines.

What’s next

(With inputs from agencies)

Turkey’s much-hyped Bayraktar TB2 drones, hailed as revolutionary weapons in conflicts from Ukraine to Libya, have suffered a devastating reputational blow after Pakistan’s Turkish-origin drone fleet failed spectacularly during Operation Sindoor. Indian forces, using indigenous Akashteer air defense systems, shot down every single Turkish-origin drone in the May conflict, leaving the Turkish defense industry scrambling to defend its once-prized exports.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has long touted Turkish-made drones as a symbol of his “Islamist vision” and a centerpiece of Turkey’s defense ambitions. The drones were not only instruments of hard power but also a diplomatic tool for Turkish influence in Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia. But as India’s Akashteer system intercepted Pakistani drones with 100% accuracy, Turkey’s arms export ambitions took a direct hit.Also read: Turkish drones to Chinese missiles, India beat them all This collapse of performance-described by a senior Indian officer as “not a single drone achieving its objective”-has raised fresh doubts about Turkish drones’ battlefield credibility and the broader promise of Turkey’s defense industry.Pakistan’s military imported hundreds of Turkish drones, hoping to overwhelm Indian air defenses and showcase Turkish technology as a regional power equalizer.Instead, the attack ended in humiliating defeat. Indian Air Defence officers confirmed that 300-400 Turkish drones, including Byker YIHA III kamikaze drones and Turkish-origin micro-drones like Songatri and eYatri, were neutralized in mid-air before they could even scratch Indian defenses.A Pakistani source told Reuters that Turkish drones were meant to provide cover for manned aircraft and artillery strikes, but “the drones failed to reach targets” as India’s integrated air defenses, from legacy L70 guns to cutting-edge Akashteer radars, kicked in.Michael Rubin, an analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, minced no words: “Erdogan may offer a hard sale to promote his Islamist vision or simply to enrich his family, but the product he is selling is now subpar. Just as socialism stymies development as bureaucrats fail to adjust for competition, so too does nepotism ruin industries. Baykar, knowing it had full state support, simply stopped innovating effectively. ”Pakistani officials have tried to downplay the losses, insisting they are re-evaluating drone deployment strategies. But the magnitude of the failure is hard to hide: Indian Air Defence sources say they recovered hundreds of drone parts along the border-clear evidence of Turkey’s failure to deliver.The real star of this clash? India’s homegrown Akashteer system. Developed by Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL), Akashteer integrates seamlessly with Indian Army and Air Force radars. It automates threat detection, tracks targets, and assigns weapons in real time-a feature that proved decisive in the face of Pakistan’s drone swarm.“It didn’t roar or flash - it listened, calculated and struck with precision,” an official told PTI. “Every threat was intercepted, every target neutralised.”This level of precision is no fluke. Indian officers compared Akashteer’s performance to Israel’s Iron Dome, noting that while Iron Dome specializes in missile defense, Akashteer has shown exceptional versatility against low-flying drones and loitering munitions.For Turkey, the reputational hit goes beyond this one conflict. The Bayraktar TB2 had become the face of Turkish defense sales, with celebrated success stories in the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war and early phases of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. But cracks were already showing. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky noted last year that “those or other drones can help, but do not affect the result,” as Russia’s electronic warfare systems jammed Bayraktar drones.The India-Pakistan clash has underscored these vulnerabilities, exposing Turkish drones as poorly adapted to modern electronic and radar-dense battlefields.This is not the first time that battlefield performance has shattered weapons myths. In 1982, Israeli Air Force F-15s and F-16s downed over 80 Soviet-built Syrian MiGs without losing a single plane-an outcome that punctured the myth of Soviet invincibility in Arab states. Analysts say Turkey is facing a similar reckoning now.“Any African despot or Central Asian country still purchasing Turkish hardware should recognize they risk wasting hundreds of millions of dollars,” Rubin warned.For President Erdogan and his son-in-law’s company Baykar, the India-Pakistan conflict is more than just a marketing setback. It’s a blow to Turkey’s entire narrative of self-sufficiency and regional influence.Analysts are already warning that countries in Africa and Central Asia that relied on Turkish drones may now look elsewhere. China and the US remain key players in the global drone market, and Turkey’s stumble has opened the door for rivals to push their systems as more reliable and battle-proven.As Pakistan rebuilds its airfields and grapples with the aftermath of this clash, Turkey’s defense industry is facing questions that go well beyond the battlefield. In Africa, Somali and Libyan leaders had turned to Turkish drones to prop up their regimes. In Ethiopia, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed used Bayraktar drones to devastating effect against Tigray forces. But after this fiasco, prospective buyers may pause-fearing that the Turkish drones they once saw as cost-effective alternatives to Western systems may be little more than paper tigers.Meanwhile, India’s success with Akashteer has emboldened its push for indigenous defense technology. Smit Shah of the Drone Federation India said that India plans to triple its drone investments in the next two years-leveraging the lessons of Operation Sindoor to build a robust domestic drone and counter-drone ecosystem.","Turkey's much-hyped Bayraktar TB2 drones have suffered a devastating reputational blow.

Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov on Friday claimed that while India had joined the QUAD alliance, which includes the United States, Japan, and Australia, solely for trade purposes the countries within the group were already attempting to organize naval and other military exercises.“We spoke to our Indian friends back then and they told us that their interest in joining the QUAD is exclusively of trade of economic nature and cooperation in other peaceful areas,” he said.He pointed out that “in practice, other countries from the Quad are already trying, already insisting on organizing naval exercises and other military exercises not, not under the Quad edges.”Lavrov warned that these activities are part of a larger agenda to militarise the grouping, adding, “they try to involve all the four countries into these exercises. And I’m sure that our Indian friends, they can see this provocation clearly.”The Russian foreign minister also said that the time is right to resume Russia-India-China (RIC) trilateral mechanism, citing a reported thaw in border tensions between New Delhi and Beijing.""Now that, as I understand, an understanding has been reached between India and China on how to calm the situation on the border, it seems to me that the time has come to revive this RIC troika,"" Lavrov said while addressing an international conference in Perm, Russia.Also read: West trying to pit India against China, says Russian foreign minister Lavrov Lavrov described the format originally established at the initiative of former Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov as a valuable forum that had previously convened over 20 times at the level of foreign ministers and across economic, trade, and financial domains.""I would like to reaffirm our interest in seeing the resumption of the three trilateral format. Russia, India, China, that was established many years ago at the initiative of Maxim Primakov. And since then it has held ministerial meetings for more than 20 times, not only at the level of the heads of the foreign ministries, but between the other economic, trade and financial organizations of these three countries. And when India and China are finally coming to an agreement on how the situation at the border can be resolved, I think it's high time we resume the talks in this format,"" Lavrov said.Earlier, Lavrov had directly blamed the West for trying to ""drive a wedge"" between India and China, criticising the strategic rebranding of the Asia-Pacific as the “Indo-Pacific” and warning that such moves were designed to isolate China and sideline Asean.“This is a policy that Russian President Vladimir Putin recently highlighted again ‘divide and conquer,’” Lavrov had said.",Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov says India joined the QUAD alliance solely for trade purposes.

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra police have launched a probe against a senior doctor in Latur for allegedly directing a colleague to ""kill"" a Covid patient during the pandemic in 2021.According to officials, the probe follows the release of an audio clip of a conversation between the accused, Dr. Shashikant Deshpande, and Dr. Shashikant Dange on social media platforms.Dr Deshpande was then posted as additional district surgeon at the Udgir Government Hospital in Latur, while Dr Dange, who was posted at a Covid-19 care centre, news agency PTI reported.In the conversation, Dr Deshpande was heard saying, ""Don't allow anyone to go inside, just kill that Dayami woman,"" To this, Dr Dange responded cautiously, noting that oxygen support had already been reduced.The patient, Kausar Fatima, wife of Dayami Ajimoddin Gaussoddin (53), had later recovered from the disease.After a complaint, the Udgir city police filed an FIR against Deshpande on May 24 under legal provisions for deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings and other offences.As per the FIR, the complainant said that in 2021, during the pandemic, his wife Kausar Fatima (then aged 41), tested positive for Covid.She was admitted as an inpatient at the government hospital in Udgir on April 15, 2021, and Covid treatment was being provided in a building opposite an eye hospital on Nanded Road, under the management of the hospital. Dr Dange was treating Covid-19 patients at that centre.The woman remained admitted there for 10 days. Around the seventh day of her admission, her husband was sitting beside Dr Dange while he was having lunch.At that moment, Dr Dange, who received a call from Dr Deshpande, placed the phone on speaker and continued the conversation regarding hospital matters.During the call, Dr Deshpande enquired about bed availability.When Dr Dange informed him that there were no vacant beds, the man claimed that he distinctly heard Dr Deshpande saying, ""Kill the Dayami patient. You're used to dealing with such people."" He also allegedly made a caste-based slur during the conversation, as per the man's complaint.The man said he was shocked, but chose to remain silent at the time since his wife was still undergoing treatment. A few days later, his wife recovered and was discharged.However, on May 2, 2025, the audio clip of the purported conversation surfaced on social media.The man said hearing the same disturbing remarks again deeply hurt him and offended his religious sentiments, especially the alleged use of derogatory caste-related comments, following which he lodged the police complaint.According to officials, Deshpande's statement has been recorded and his phone has been seized.According to inspector Dilip Gade, the police were verifying the authenticity of the audio clip.""He is out of district and will come tomorrow. After that, we will collect his mobile phone and conduct an inquiry,"" Gade said.","Dr Shashikant Deshpande allegedly directed a colleague to ""kill"" a Covid patient during the pandemic in 2021.

DGCA gives 'last & final' 3-month extension to IndiGo for 2 Boeing 777s wet leased from Turkish Airlines,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dgca-gives-last-final-3-month-extension-to-indigo-for-2-boeing-777s-wet-leased-from-turkish-airlines/articleshow/121519413.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has given “one time last and final three-month extension” to IndiGo for the two wide body Boeing 777s it has wet leased (hired with operating crew) from Turkish Airlines. The airline can use them till Aug 31, instead of Nov 30, 2025, as it had applied for. The DGCA gave this final extension “in order to avoid passenger inconvenience due to immediate flight disruption” after getting an “undertaking from the airline that they will terminate the damp lease with Turkish Airline within this extension period, and not seek any further extension for these operations,” said a senior aviation official.“Indigo is currently operating two Boeing 777-300 extended range aircraft under damp lease from Turkish Airline, which was permitted upto May 31, 2025. IndiGo requested for a further extension of the same for another six months, which was not agreed to. However, in order to avoid passenger inconvenience due to immediate flight disruption, IndiGo has been granted a one-time last and final extension of three months,” said the official.Turkey’s steadfast supported to Pakistan during Operation Sindoor, apart from Pakistan using Turkish drones to attack Indian cities near the western border, has led to a rethink in New Delhi. India had a fortnight back revoked the security clearance of Turkish ground handling company Celebi which led it from being barred at the nine Indiana airports where it used to operate. DGCA’s Friday ruling comes in that backdrop.IndiGo had requested Indian aviation authorities to extend the lease period by another six months for two Turkish Airlines’ wide body Boeing 777 which the budget carrier uses on routes between Delhi/Mumbai and Istanbul. IndiGo has since early 2023 used these wet leased (hired with operating crew) Turkish planes to operate a daily direct between Delhi & Istanbul and Mumbai & Istanbul. Turkish has the same two daily routes, with no more room for any more flights between the two countries under current bilaterals that Turkey has unsuccessfully tried with the Modi govt to be revised upwards for some years now.IndiGo since 2018 has a code share with Turkish. A significant number of passengers on Turkish and IndiGo flights fly between India and rest of the world via Istanbul on Turkish network — something that hurts Air India’s multi billion dollar plan for providing direct connectivity to & from India. In the past, AI has frowned at the long term wet lease of wide body aircraft done by IndiGo.On the Turkish wet lease issue, IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers said Friday: “We operate under the ambit of the air service agreement between India and Turkey. A large number of passengers, mostly Indians, are booked on these flights (to & from Istanbul) to travel between India and other countries (via Istanbul). The (wet lease) is as per regulatory approvals and we will be in conformity with those requirements.”",IndiGo had requested Indian aviation authorities to extend the lease period by another six months for two Turkish Airlines’ wide body Boeing 777 which the budget carrier uses on routes between Delhi/Mumbai and Istanbul.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday directed the National Board of Examinations (NBE) to conduct the NEET-PG exam in one sitting for all 2.4 lakh candidates instead of the scheduled test in two shifts in 900 centres across India on June 15.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath, Sanjay Kumar and N V Anjaria said it was not ready to accept that the body conducting the examination could not find enough centres to accommodate all candidates in one shift. ""Holding the examination in two shifts is arbitrary and does not allow candidates to have the same question paper. Any two different question papers will vary in their difficulty levels,"" the bench said.When counsel for NBE said the norm in IIT-JEE was to have multiple sets of question papers and then apply normalisation of marks according to difficulty levels of questions, SC said normalisation of marks could be adopted only in exceptional circumstances and not routinely year after year.It directed NBE to set up an adequate number of additional examination centres to conduct NEET-PG in one sitting. When the counsel said the process for identifying additional secure examination centres could result in postponing the June 15 exam date, the bench said if the authorities require postponement of the test for finding more centres, it would have to seek permission from the court.","The Supreme Court on Friday directed the National Board of Examinations to conduct the NEET-PG exam in one sitting for all 2.4 lakh candidates instead of the scheduled test in two shifts.

There is nothing like wealth that

Brings the insignificant to prominence.

Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece.A friend and co-speaker, Raja, has often shared a deeply personal episode from his youth. He was then unknown, and without means. A wedding in the family required financial help, and he turned to a wealthy relative with a humble request for Rs. 5,000.He was told to wait outside the house. And so, he waited—from 11 in the morning—under the harsh sun, parched, hesitant to step away for a sip of water. Hours passed. Finally, at 5pm, household help emerged—not with help, but with a verdict: “You are not lucky enough to receive support.” That day, Raja said, the truth struck him with greater force than the sun above—This truth does not apply to individuals alone but in the fate of nations as well.After nearly two centuries of British rule and another seven decades of struggles, India is now poised to become the world’s fourth-largest economy. According to IMF reports, India’s nominal GDP is projected to reach $4.19 trillion by the end of the year, slightly ahead of Japan’s $4.18 trillion. If this momentum continues, India may overtake Germany and claim the third spot by 2028.This ascent has not been easy. For generations, India has been a cautionary tale of lost wealth and squandered dignity. When the British arrived, India held 23% of the global economy which reduced to less than 4% when they left. The famed Industrial Revolution of England was built on the ruins of Indian craftsmanship. India’s wealth funded the British empire, its taxes paying the British officials, its famine feeding their fortunes. Historians estimate that between 15 and 29 million Indians died from starvation during British rule, much of it linked directly to exploitative policies.Even in the 1960s, we were staggering under the weight of poverty. Food shortage forced us to seek grain aid from countries like the United States. Former CIA official Bruce Riedel’s book cites letters written in 1962 from Indian leadership to John F Kennedy pleading for advanced fighter jets, transport aircraft, and supersonic air forces, as India was losing ground to China in a border war. Kennedy refused the request—gently, but firmly.From seeking food and defence aid to now becoming the world’s fourth economic power is a journey steeped in struggle and silent grit.Economists may credit reforms and policies but the efforts of its people—especially the young—should also be credited. With a median age in the early 30s, India is more open to adopting change and new technology than societies like Japan, with a much older population.Among the new revolutions in technology, the UPI remains my favourite. Nearly a decade ago, I attended a meeting with the creators of UPI—then a nascent idea under the Reserve Bank of India. It felt like science fiction when they spoke of a future where every payment will happen via mobile phones.Today, it’s part of everyday life. Last year alone, India saw over a billion UPI transactions. On a street corner,, a 72-year-old idli vendor, refuses to extend credit when customers say they have no change. “You can GPay, RuPay or PhonePe—but please pay,” she says. She never went to school. That is the India we are becoming.There is still a long way to go. The per capita GDP of Japan is over $33,000, while India’s still hovers below $3,000.Saint poet Valluvar did not limit his wisdom to spiritual wealth but also material wealth, and gave the most prudent advice about earning prosperity.","After nearly two centuries of British rule and another seven decades of struggles, India is now poised to become the world’s fourth-largest economy.

PUNE: The first batch of 17 women National Defence Academy (NDA) cadets passed out Friday, scripting a new chapter in the annals of the Indian Armed Forces.Unlike previous parades during their three years at the academy, when they had a separate contingent, the 17 marched with male cadets at the Pune academy's Arun Khetarpal Parade Grounds, indistinguishable from their military crew haircut and confident stride.The passing-out parade (PoP) marked a culmination of the hard work, determination, motivation and high standards of physical fitness. The women, part of a total of 336 cadets who passed out, celebrated later with a ""push-up"" competition.Former Army chief and Mizoram governor V K Singh, who reviewed the parade, described it as a unique moment in NDA's history. ""These young women are the inimitable symbol of nari shakti, embodying not just women's development but women-led development. I envision a future not far from now when one of these women rises to the highest echelon of the service they go to. The moment shows the uniqueness of the NDA as we could not distinguish male and female cadets during the parade,"" said Singh, who passed out of NDA in 1969.Academy Cadet Captain Udayveer Singh Negi, who commanded the parade, echoed the views. ""The women cadets performed well. They outshone male cadets in many aspects,"" Negi said.The hours-long rehearsals for the parade in scorching heat and rain culminated with impressive results, said Ishita Singh, one of the women cadets. ""PoP is one of the most important events in military life. I always wanted to celebrate this occasion in front of my parents and dear ones. Today, I could fulfil my wish,"" Ishita told TOI.According to NDA commandant Gurcharan Singh, when girls first came to the academy, they were staying separately. ""Today, they are integrated completely with squadrons and battalions. They are running, playing and training together. Every activity is gender-neutral,"" Gurcharan said.The parents could not be more delighted. ""My daughter is not only mine now. She is the daughter of the nation. She is our only daughter. When she decided to join NDA, we supported her. She was inspired by her grandfather, who had served in the Army,"" said Ashok Mehalan, father of cadet Sheetal Mehalan and businessman from Rohtak in Haryana.According to C Sangwan, father of cadet Ishita, his daughter has given him ""a new identity"". ""When we got to know about entry for women in NDA, we asked her to submit her form 20 days before the exam. She cleared it. Today, she proved her mettle and made us very proud,"" said Sangwan, who hails from Jhunjhunu in Rajasthan.Ajit Duhan, father of Ritul Duhan, the first Battalion Cadet Captain of the women's batch, fell ""short of words to praise her achievement"".

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court Friday greenlighted Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai's theme garden that came up at the site of the more than 100-year-old Khajuria lake in Kandivali (West), overturning a 2018 judgment of the Bombay HC directing the Maharashtra government and MCGM to demolish the constructions and restore the lake.However, SC asked MCGM to maintain and preserve the existing park as a green area in perpetuity, exclusively for public use without any predominant commercial activity. The park serves as a vital recreational nucleus for children, offering them safe spaces for play and physical activity; provides senior citizens dedicated areas for walking and social interaction; and creates opportunities for community engagement and leisure. A bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh also directed MCGM to ""constitute an expert committee within three months to explore the feasibility of developing an alternative water body in nearby areas to compensate for the ecological functions of the original water body"".Writing the judgment, Justice Kant further asked MCGM to undertake a comprehensive exercise within a year for the ecological restoration of water bodies that are dying, and file compliance reports before HC.It requested HC ""to see that the directions issued by the SC are complied with in letter and spirit"".Interestingly, HC's 2018 judgment was passed by a bench of which Justice A S Oka, who retired recently as an SC judge, was a part. The case lingered on in the SC, with the verdict finally delivered five days after Justice Oka's retirement. Allowing MCGM's appeal, the bench said though HC's views were well-intentioned and, prima facie, a correct interpretation of settled notions such as the public trust doctrine, they required reconsideration through the ""prism of practical realities and evolved ground conditions"". Justice Kant said, ""There cannot be a simplistic binary choice between a park or a pond, as each serves distinct ecological and social functions contingent upon specific circumstances, geographical location, and evolving usage patterns"".The verdant recreational park that came up over the so-called lake, one that had been reduced to a garbage dump over the years and could not support flora and fauna, is now a well-maintained urban oasis, teeming with mature trees, as the appeals are being finally decided more than 15 years after it came up at the site, he added. ""It provides an essential green space in an increasingly concretised urban environment, with trees and other foliage contributing significantly to oxygen generation, air purification, and microclimate regulation,"" the bench said.

It also cancelled the subsequent allotment of the same land to Jagdishpur Paper Mills.Terming KNMT a chronic defaulter, the bench said, ""UPSIDC's action in treating KNMT as a defaulter was, therefore, both justified and necessary to preserve the integrity of the allotment process. Allowing such deliberate defaults to persist unchecked would undermine the entire framework of land allocation and set a detrimental precedent.""Writing the judgment, Justice Kant faulted UPSIDC for not following the public trust doctrine in allotment of lands. ""While we have upheld the cancellation due to KNMT's default, the circumstances reveal systemic concerns in the original allocation process. UPSIDC allotted the land to KNMT within merely two months of application (in 2003), raising questions about the thoroughness of the evaluation.Furthermore, during the pendency of this dispute, UPSIDC demonstrated remarkable alacrity in considering alternative allotments to Jagdishpur Paper Mills Ltd,"" it said.Justice Kant said the public trust doctrine required that allocations must be preceded by a thorough assessment of public benefits, beneficiary credentials, and safeguards ensuring continued compliance with stated purposes. None of it was enforced while allotting the land to KNMT or the paper mill, the bench said and cancelled the allotment to the paper mill.SC said, ""UPSIDC ought to have considered verifiable evidence of economic benefits, employment generation potential, environmental sustainability, and alignment with regional development objectives to demonstrate that the decision serves the collective benefit.""""The failure to adopt transparent mechanisms not only deprived the public exchequer of potential revenue, as evidenced by the substantial appreciation in the value of such a large tract of land, but also created a system where privileged access supersedes equal opportunity. This betrays the fiduciary relationship between the State and its citizens,"" it said.SC directed the UP government and UPSIDC to ensure that all future land allotments must be made in a transparent, non-discriminatory and fair manner, and fetched maximum revenue while achieving the larger public interests - industrial development, environmental sustainability and regional economic objectives.",Supreme Court: UP nixing land allotment to Kamla Nehru Trust justified.

MUMBAI: Property experts estimate a free sale component of roughly 140 million sq ft to be unlocked by the Dharavi redevelopment plan, yielding revenues of Rs 1.2-1.7 lakh crore for the joint venture between the state government and the Adani group Said Anuj Puri, chairman, Anarock Group, ""At a rough estimate, the Dharavi redevelopment project presents the builder with about 140 million sq.ft. of overall saleable area for sale on the open market, with a separate allotment for rehabilitation of the current inhabitants. We are roughly looking at over Rs 1 lakh crore of gross revenue. The anticipated profit margins are anywhere between 18-25%. It is also important to note that the Dharavi redevelopment project permits the developer to monetize TDR, or Transferable Development Rights, as well as commercial spaces. ''Nav Bharat Mega Developers is a special purpose vehicle between the Adani Group and the state for Dharavi's revamp. Total rehab cost including housing units for eligible beneficiaries and other for affordable rental housing is projected at Rs 95,790 crore, of which construction cost will be Rs 23,800 crore. This factors in the cost of building and handing over 72,000 units free of cost (residential rehab units, residential renewal units, commercial and industrial rehab units and commercial renewal units).Since 270 acres have been demarcated as net developable area, all the land left over after providing 72,000 units will be available to develop in the free sale component.Pankaj Kapoor, MD of Liases Foras, a realty research firm, said he expects profit margins to be 25-30%. ""This is on a projected revenue of Rs 1.2 lakh crore to Rs 1.7 lakh crore from the sale component at average market price of Rs 25,000 a sq ft,'' he added.""Projected saleable area is expected to range between 40.7 million sq ft and 60 million sq ft, depending on extent of FSI utilized for the rehabilitation portion,"" said Kapoor.However, he cautioned that the project's seven-year completion timeline was ""highly ambitious''. ""To stay on track, achieving annual sales of approximately 6.5 to 9 million sq ft will be a challenge and necessitate highly competitive pricing,'' he said.Architect Alan Abraham said at Rs 95,000-plus crore, the Dharavi project is cheaper than the bullet train, only 3x the cost of Mumbai Metro 3 and 6x the cost of the coastal road. ""It seems really inexpensive to transform our city centre, to better the lives of millions of our citizens. If the development of Dharavi is so important to our city, then I wonder why the government couldn't just do this themselves - while keeping these and the additional lands public, and earning all the revenue from the TDR,'' he said. ""In my opinion, the sale price of the Dharavi project will exceed those in Bandra-Kurla Complex, and perhaps even Linking Road,'' he added.Aditya Thackeray, Shiv Sena (UBT) leader, said the Adani Group was given incentives for this project in the form of 1,300 acres across the city free. ""BMC is being denied a premium of Rs 7,500 crore for its land and the TDR incentive."" He said the MVA government showed a better model of redevelopment for BDD chawls through a government agency.","Property experts estimate a free sale component of roughly 140 million sq ft to be unlocked by the Dharavi redevelopment plan.

NEW DELHI: In a span of just a month, PM Narendra Modi has twice taken top central government bureaucrats and state chief secretaries by surprise by flagging public grievances that had reached him directly, reports Dipak Dash.On April 30, secretaries and chief secretaries attending a meeting under Pragati - the performance audit PM holds periodically - were surprised when Modi raised shortcomings in the implementation of the Jal Jeevan Mission, a scheme to reach piped water to all households.On Wednesday, he again left them amazed when, during a review of the functioning of real estate regulators, he shared feedback that files in RERA offices don't move unless ""vyavastha"", a popular Hindu euphemism for pleasing the authorities, has been made.Senior officials said the two meetings, apart from providing a peek into the PM's continuing connect with the grassroots, were also symbolic of the government's decision to focus on problems which are holding up last-mile delivery of well-intentioned schemes. This also helps explain, sources said, why the 11th anniversary of the Modi govt passed without large-scale events or publicity campaigns.","PM Narendra Modi has twice taken top central government bureaucrats by surprise by flagging public grievances that had reached him directly.

NEW DELHI: In a bid to cool down edible oil prices, the government on Friday lowered the basic customs tax on crude edible oils by 10 percentage points. The duty change, effective Friday, is aimed at lowering the prices of palm oil, soyoil and sunflower oil.The move, which will reduce the effective duty to 16.5%, came amid a spike in prices, estimated at 17.4% in the retail inflation data for April.Prices of edible oils have heated up globally, negating the impact of a bumper mustard harvest in India. Mustard oil prices on average are 25% higher at over Rs 170 a litre, according to official data.Compared with a year ago, the average retail price of palm oil soared 34% to Rs 134 a litre on May 28, while sunflower prices were 30% higher.

KOLKATA: Calcutta high court rapped a city college for cancelling an economics professor's child care leave (CCL) of six months, availed to look after her one year old twin daughters, and withholding her salary for the period.""If nourishing years of the two infants are not the right time to grant CCL to petitioner, then one wonders whether the governing body of the college was trying to save it for a later period, when there may possibly be no need for such leave,"" Justice Jay Sengupta observed in his May 19 order.HC directed Calcutta Girls College authorities to sanction 189 days of CCL to the assistant professor, and release her salary dues for the period within six weeks. Denying the petitioner such leave would amount to flouting the applicable law, the bench ruled.The professor approached the high court after the college, in a decision on Jan 11, 2024, rejected her CCL availed from Jan 11 to July 18, 2023, and directed her to refund the salary received during that period.The petitioner stated that she took maternity leave of 180 days from Nov 12, 2021 to May 10, 2022. She gave birth to the twins via C-section on Nov 26, 2021.She returned to work on May 11, 2022, and on the same day, applied for child care leave to look after her daughters at her Siliguri home, as her husband was abroad and elderly parents-in-law were ill.She was granted and availed CCL from Jan 11 to July 18, 2023. Suffering from post-pregnancy issues, she again applied for CCL from July 21 to Oct 31, 2023, which was sanctioned, and leave without pay from Nov 1, 2023 to Feb 29, 2024, which was approved. She resumed duties on March 1, 2024.According to the rules outlined in the memorandum of Jan 18, 2016, a woman employee is entitled to child care leave for a period of two years, i.e., 730 days, during her entire service period, until the eldest two of her children reach the age of 18 years. She can apply three times within a year, or apply at once for one year.The college submitted that petitioner went on CCL from Jan 11 to July 18, 2023, ""without following the proper rules, as per Calcutta University statutes and Acts"", and her salary for the disputed period was stopped ""due to her unauthorised leave"".However, the judge rejected the arguments and noted that the petitioner was well within her rights to claim CCL, and there was no reason for the college governing body not to have considered her application favourably.","Calcutta high court rapped a city college for cancelling an economics professor's child care leave.

KANPUR/ BIKRAMGANJ: PM Narendra Modi Friday said Pakistan had to 'beg for a ceasefire' during Operation Sindoor , in yet another assertion by India that contradicts Donald Trump's claim that the US President had brokered peace between the two neighbours.""We penetrated hundreds of miles into Pakistan and destroyed the hideouts of terrorists,"" the PM said at a rally in Kanpur.""Due to the bravery of our army, Pakistan had to plead and beg for a ceasefire,"" he said, adding: ""The one who was begging during Operation Sindoor must not forget - it is not over yet.""A day after a video of Pakistani PM Shehbaz Sharif, during his recent trip to Azerbaijan, went viral in which he is heard admitting that India's pre-emptive BrahMos missile strikes at military sites impeded Islamabad's attempts to retaliate, Modi underlined the use of swadeshi weapons during Operation Sindoor. ""The BrahMos missile which didn't let the enemy sleep has a new address, Uttar Pradesh ,"" he said, referring to the production of the indigenous missile in Lucknow which started last month.Modi asserted at the Kanpur rally, and at another one in Bihar’s Bikramganj, that terrorists would be traced wherever they are, and punished. Using a Kanpuri slang, ‘haunk’, literally meaning pulverised, he said: “Agar main seedhe seedhe Kanpuriya mein kahun, dushman kahin bhi ho haunk diya jayega.”In Bikramganj, Modi likened terror to a serpent, saying, “If it raises its hood again, it would be dragged out of its hole and trampled.”He asserted that Indian armed forces had reduced to rubble the hideouts of those who had masterminded the Pahalgam massacre sitting in Pakistan and “destroyed the sindoor of our sisters”.Invoking Lord Ram, Modi recalled that at his first public rally just a day after the Pahalgam massacre on April 22, he had made the solemn pledge to the nation from Madhubani that masterminds of the dastardly crime would face punishment beyond their imagination. Terming Operation Sindoor as a policy against terror and emphasising that he had fulfilled his promise, the PM said: “Pran jaye par vachan na jaye: Prabhu Ram ki ye reeti naye Bharat ki niti ban gayi hai. ”Modi said those who once felt secure under the protection of the Pakistani military have been brought to their knees by India’s forces in a single decisive action and added that Operation Sindoor was “just an arrow in India’s quiver”.The PM hailed extraordinary valour and indomitable courage displayed by BSF during Operation Sindoor, while paying tribute to BSF sub-inspector Imtiaz, who was martyred on May 10 at the border.Modi also launched development projects worth more than Rs 48,520 crore in Bihar.

LUCKNOW: A day after being assaulted in office by a joint commissioner, a deputy commissioner-level Indian Revenue Service (IRS) officer accused the senior colleague of attacking him over a three-month-old dispute related to a departmental cricket match.An FIR was registered at Lucknow's Hazratganj police station on Friday over the incident, which allegedly also involved a strangulation bid.Complainant Gaurav Garg - a 2016-batch IRS officer posted at the income tax office in Hazratganj - alleged that joint commissioner Yogendra Kumar Mishra, currently posted in Uttarakhand's Kashipur, barged into the office on Thursday and launched a violent and premeditated assault in the presence of senior officers.Garg said the dispute dated back to Feb 13, when Mishra, then posted in Lucknow, allegedly insisted on being appointed as captain of the departmental cricket team during a tournament. After his request was denied, Mishra allegedly threatened to disrupt the match by squatting on the pitch.Garg alleged that Mishra continued to harass the team members on WhatsApp, sending messages like, ""I know about your sister's affair"", and ""Be careful, NCB is watching.""He even threatened to plant drugs to frame them, Garg claimed. Over a dozen complaints were reportedly filed, following which Mishra was transferred to Uttarakhand.The complainant alleged that on May 29, Mishra stormed into the office, where a farewell was being planned for the outgoing principal chief commissioner at a departmental meeting.According to the FIR, Mishra hurled abuses and demanded his transfer orders be revoked. He then picked up a glass tumbler, splashed water on Garg and attempted to stab him with the broken glass. When Garg tried to leave, Mishra allegedly grabbed him by the throat, choking him. ""He then punched me repeatedly, injuring my nose, lips and ear. He even kicked me in the groin,"" Garg alleged.Police were informed and Garg was rushed to the hospital.

Nevertheless, he now wishes he had not paid the full advance. After numerous attempts to reach the company for a refund or project completion, Johnson said he's been given 'the runaround' for over a year.“He's been giving me the runaround for over a year now when I ask about either a refund or just for the work to be completed.

Speaking at the Computex 2025 tech conference in Taipei, Huang applauded Trump’s plan to roll back the Biden-era AI export restrictions, saying the prior policy was based on “fundamentally flawed” assumptions.“President Trump realises it’s exactly the wrong goal,” Huang said, referencing the Biden administration’s approach that blocked exports to China entirely and categorised countries into three tiers, news agency Reuters reported.Trump officials are now considering replacing that system with a global licensing regime aimed at preserving US leverage in trade talks.Under the Biden rules, Huang said Nvidia’s share of the Chinese AI market plummeted from 95% to 50%, while Chinese firms like Huawei capitalised, accelerating the country’s domestic semiconductor industry.“All in all, the export control was a failure,” Huang stated.“The assumptions that led to the AI diffusion rule have been proven to be fundamentally flawed,” he added.Despite US efforts to slow Chinese AI development, Huang noted that research there continues at scale, powered by massive domestic investment. He estimated China’s AI market could hit $50 billion in 2025—representing a critical opportunity for Nvidia, if re-entry is allowed.“The competition in China is really intense. They would love for us never to go back,” Huang added.Nvidia has already taken a $5.5 billion hit due to the chip restrictions and projects an additional $15 billion in revenue loss related to its restricted H20 AI chips . The company is now designing a version of its next-generation Blackwell chip with slower memory to comply with current rules.Earlier this week, Beijing slammed Washington for what it called “discriminatory” measures after US authorities warned firms against using Chinese chips like Huawei’s Ascend.","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang blasts Biden-era AI chip export policy.

Elon Musk announces his exit from DOGE

Billionaire investor Mark Cuban has said that he is not impressed with the design choices of Tesla. Speaking at ""Your Mom's House"" podcast in March, he was asked ‘what's your favorite car?’. Cuban, who owns a Tesla replied with a grin “A Kia. EV6.” He further added “I like it. I'm comfortable with it.”Revealing that he hasn’t sold his Tesla ‘yet’, Mark Cuban explained: “On the Tesla you've got to find [the turn signal] and push the button… while you're driving. You can't pay attention to the road as much.”Praising Kia, he said: “It doesn't try to be too fancy. Your turn signal is like… a turn signal”.While Mark Cuban doesn’t mind driving a ‘cheaper’ Kia EV6, but his 15-year-old son isn’t impressed. When Cuban suggested handing down the car for driving practice, his son quickly shut it down, saying, “It’s not cool, Dad.” He even called it a “nerd car.” Cuban’s response? “Exactly,” he said, embracing the label.Mark Cuban is a known Elon Musk critic. Earlier this year on the ""Club Shay Shay"" podcast, Cuban admitted that he likes provoking Musk because he has ""really thin skin and it just makes it easy.""In another interview earlier this year, Cuban said “I have no problem throwing Elon under the bus, but I'll save it for when it's truly deserved.”Last year, when Musk encouraged users to share more positive content on X, Cuban wasted no time in delivering a sharp retort. “Please post a bit more positive, beautiful or informative content on this platform,” the Tesla CEO then wrote. Cuban commented “You first”.In a latest update, Musk has announced his exit from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). In an X post, he wrote: “As my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President @realDonaldTrump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending.

Jaire Alexander’s future is uncertain in Green Bay Packers

Las Vegas Raiders may consider a Jaire Alexander trade if cost is low





The NFL offseason brings many surprises. One of them includes Green Bay Packers cornerback Jaire Alexander. He is 27 years old and signed a big $84 million deal. But injuries have slowed him down. The Las Vegas Packers may not want to keep paying him. There are talks that he could be traded or cut. A new report says the Las Vegas Raiders might want him. Many fans and experts are now watching this closely. The deal could happen soon if nothing changes for the Green Bay Packers.On May 27, 2025, Cody Benjamin from CBS Sports said the Las Vegas Raiders could go after Jaire Alexander. The Green Bay Packers already asked him to change his contract. But it is not clear if he agreed. Jaire Alexander has had injuries in three of the last four seasons. He missed many games due to shoulder and back problems.In May 2022, the Green Bay Packers gave him a four-year, $84 million deal. At that time, it made him one of the top-paid players at his position. But now, the team is not sure about keeping the contract. His injuries and salary are both problems.If the Green Bay Packers cut him after June 1, they can save some money on the cap over two years.That makes it easier for the team to rebuild their defence. This is why the trade rumors are growing stronger each day.The Las Vegas Raiders made changes in March and April 2025. They signed Eric Stokes and picked Darien Porter in the draft. They also let go of Jack Jones. But the team still needs a strong slot corner. Their current group has little experience.Ian Rapoport said on May 28, 2025, on NFL Network, “The Raiders may be open to adding a veteran if the money works.”Jaire Alexander plays on the outside, not in the slot. But if he becomes a free agent and lowers his price, the Las Vegas Raiders might give him a chance.Also Read: “That's My Guy,” Quarterback Jordan Love Shares His Thoughts On Jaire Alexander","Jaire Alexander has had injuries in three of the last four seasons.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

The BJP on Saturday pulled off a major political upset by unseating the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) from Delhi after over 10 years. As per the latest Election Commission data, the BJP may win around 48 seats and the Kejriwal-led party may secure around 22 seats in the 70-seat Assembly.BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a fierce contest from the New Delhi seat by a margin of 4,089 votes. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes.Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.""We accept the mandate of the people with great humility. I congratulate the BJP for this victory and I hope they will fulfil all the promises for which people have voted for them,"" Kejriwal said in a video address posted on X.In the evening as the results were decalred, PM Modi kicked off his victory speech with a powerful chant of ""Yamuna Maiya ki Jai"". PM Modi declared that the people of Delhi were experiencing both relief and joy -- relief from the ""disaster"" (AAP-da governance) and joy in embracing a new era under BJP rule. ""I had written a letter to every Delhi resident, urging them to give the BJP a chance to serve in the 21st century...Today, I bow my head in gratitude to every family in Delhi for trusting us. You have given us love with an open heart, and I assure you that we will return it manifold through rapid development,"" PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also attacked the AAP over allegations of corruption against its leaders, saying that all links of such charges will be probed and those who ""looted"" money will have to return it.With the BJP set to regain control of Delhi after 27 years, what went wrong for the Aam Aadmi Party?After governing Delhi for a decade, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) faced significant anti-incumbency.While AAP achieved impressive results in health and education during its first two terms, and kept voters happy with power and water subsidies, unfulfilled promises, such as improved air quality, became major poll issues.The AAP's assertion that the BJP government at the Centre was creating roadblocks in its functioning began to be increasingly seen by voters as excuses, especially after ten years in power.The BJP's ""double engine"" promise, suggesting seamless governance between the central and state levels, appealed to voters against the backdrop of AAP's constant conflicts with the Centre. Furthermore, internal disarray within the AAP, with senior leaders facing jail time, added to the challenges of incumbency .The image of Arvind Kejriwal as an anti-corruption crusader suffered a setback due to several factors, most notably the controversy surrounding the now-scrapped liquor policy.The BJP accused the AAP government of turning Delhi into a ""city of drunkards"" with the new policy, and receiving crores in kickbacks from those who opened the vends.Probes by central agencies led to the arrest of top AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, and Sanjay Singh. These arrests forced Sisodia to step down as deputy chief minister and kept the AAP in ""firefighting mode"", distracting from fulfilling its 2020 poll promises.Additionally, the ""Sheesh Mahal"" controversy, referring to the renovated residence of the chief minister, further dented Kejriwal's image. The BJP further highlighted a Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report that indicated the renovation cost had increased from an initial estimate of Rs 7.91 crore to Rs 33.66 crore by completion.AAP has been synonymous with Arvind Kejriwal since its inception. Kejriwal, initially seen as an agent of change with his untucked shirt and no-nonsense demeanor, resonated with the common person.However, the anti-corruption image of Kejriwal and his party suffered irreparable damage, specially after the AAP leader's arrest in March 2024 on corruption allegations and his subsequent resignation as CM.While he was later granted bail, the leadership transition to Atishi and the circumstances surrounding Kejriwal's arrest damaged the party's image and cohesion.The absence of an alliance with the Congress party and the Congress's strategic campaigning likely contributed to the AAP's loss.In previous elections, the AAP had significantly reduced the Congress's presence in the Delhi assembly.Attempts to convince Congress workers to collaborate with AAP volunteers reportedly led to an ""existential crisis"" among them.The Congress decided to campaign aggressively against the AAP, sensing ""anger building up against the AAP"". Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attacked the AAP in the final days of the Delhi campaign.The Congress further claimed the AAP did not want an alliance, with Kejriwal announcing all 70 candidates early on.The rise of AAP in Delhi has been congruous with the decline of the Congress. In 2013, AAP won 28 seats with a 29.49% vote share, while the Congress tally decreased to 8 seats from 43 in 2008. In 2015, Congress suffered a 15% decline in its vote share, while the AAP saw its support base rise by around 15%.While AAP's welfare schemes, such as free electricity and bus travel for women, initially garnered support, a lack of focus on infrastructure development and maintenance became a significant issue.The poor condition of roads and sewers across Delhi angered voters.Overflowing drains, potholed roads, and irregular garbage collection contributed to the party's unpopularity.The AAP's control over the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) meant it could not deflect blame for these issues onto the BJP. Voters in middle- and upper-middle-class areas were particularly affected by the deteriorating infrastructure.AAP's origins trace back to Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption movement, positioning the party as an alternative to the Congress in 2013.While AAP secured mandates in 2015 and 2020, their repeated promises and ""freebies"" seem to have lost their appeal.The promise of piped water connections for all in 2015 remains unfulfilled, as does the promise of full statehood for Delhi and the ""Rozgar Budget"" aimed at creating 20 lakh jobs.Kejriwal himself admitted that he had failed to fulfill three promises: cleaning the Yamuna, providing clean drinking water, and upgrading Delhi's roads. This acknowledgment gave the BJP an opportunity to attack the AAP, with Amit Shah mocking Kejriwal's promise to purify the Yamuna.The BJP's campaign strategy focused primarily on targeting Arvind Kejriwal and his government, rather than emphasising Hindutva, as it has often done during campainging in other state elections as well as previous Delhi polls.This approach likely resonated with a broader segment of the population, including those who may not have been inclined to support a religiously charged campaign. By focusing on issues such as corruption and governance, the BJP effectively undermined AAP's credibility and appealed to a wider range of voters.The BJP also focused on hyper-local issues such as air pollution, traffic, and public safety, and engaged with local Resident Welfare Associations. They also promoted central government schemes.The BJP also targeted specific demographics, including Purvanchalis and slum dwellers, and utilised an aggressive digital campaign with AI-enhanced content and memes targeting AAP.The BJP's consistent performance in the Lok Sabha polls in Delhi indicated a latent voter base that the party successfully mobilised this time around for the assembly elections.Despite AAP's strong performance in the assembly elections, the BJP had consistently swept Lok Sabha elections in the national capital, winning all seven seats.This pre-existing support base provided a foundation for the BJP's campaign and likely contributed to their victory.The BJP also strategically fielded Parvesh Verma, a strong Jat leader, in the New Delhi constituency, signaling their intention to win back the confidence of the Jat community, which had previously favoured AAP in Delhi elections.During the Delhi Assembly elections, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched strong criticisms against Arvind Kejriwal, which may have been payback for events in Haryana. Gandhi's attacks covered a range of issues, including alleged corruption, unfulfilled promises, and inaction on key issues.Like the BJP, Gandhi attacked Kejriwal over the alleged liquor scam and accused him of living in a ""Sheesh Mahal"" while engaging in corrupt practices.Gandhi said that Kejriwal made false promises, ""similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi"", particularly regarding cleaning the Yamuna River. He also challenged Kejriwal to drink Delhi's tap water, implying it was still polluted despite promises to clean it.The Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) win in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) in 2022 proved to be a double-edged sword, ultimately hurting the party instead of helping it. AAP had promised a cleaner city with world-class roads, but it fell short on both accounts. The MCD House was in limbo, and the Standing Committee, which controls all financial powers, was never formed. The AAP repeatedly accused the Centre of creating hurdles through the Lieutenant Governor and stalling projects.This time around, voters held the AAP accountable for the deteriorating civic infrastructure across Delhi.AAP's performance in the MCD was a letdown for the people of Delhi. The party failed to address critical issues such as clearing garbage, repairing roads, and cleaning clogged sewers. Erratic water supply and overflowing sewers that were never repaired because Rs 4,000 crore for the Delhi Jal Board was not released further hurt the party.Senior party leaders stated that the MCD functioning had collapsed under the AAP, and no work was being done, leading to frustration among councillors.The steady departure of senior leaders from AAP over time might have also weakened the party's organisational structure and public image.The exit of prominent figures like Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Mayank Gandhi, and Kumar Vishwas, who had dared to disagree with Arvind Kejriwal, and repeatedly accused Kejriwal of having an ""autocratic"" style of leadership.Resignation of senior leaders like Kailash Gahlot, who cited the party's focus on political agenda over fulfilling promises, along with internal challenges, signalled internal discord.The BJP had termed Gahlot's resignation a ""courageous move"".Negative campaigning by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) centered on issues like Yamuna River pollution, the Delhi Police, and the Election Commission (EC) may have affected public perception of the AAP government.In the lead up to the polls, Kejriwal accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna River, which supplies drinking water to Delhi. He claimed that the Haryana government deliberately sent polluted waters to Delhi to create an artificial water scarcity and blame the AAP.The AAP also repeatedly levelled accusations of voter fraud and irregularities against the BJP as well as the EC.AAP alleged that the Election Commission and Delhi Police were shielding BJP workers and accused them of ""hooliganism"". Kejriwal wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner, expressing concern over the intimidation and harassment of AAP volunteers by BJP workers. The EC responded that no written complaints could be traced in most cases but assured that all registered complaints are investigated.Kejriwal further criticised the Election Commission for allegedly refusing to make Form 17C public, a document detailing the number of votes polled at each booth. AAP then launched a website, transparentelections.in, claiming to upload Form 17C data for all constituencies to present the data in an accessible format.The EC dismissed Kejriwal's claims regarding Form 17C, stating that copies had already been provided to polling agents at each booth after voting, as per Rule 49S of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.","BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes. Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118065596,imgsize-587609,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/118065596.jpg"
'We all are going to die': Senator Ernst booed at Town Hall over support for Trump’s $700 billion spending cuts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/we-all-are-going-to-die-senator-ernst-booed-at-town-hall-over-support-for-trumps-700-billion-spending-cuts/articleshow/121528566.cms,"Senator Joni Ernst (Image credits: AP)





Republican senator Joni Ernst faced boos and groans from constituents during a tense town hall in Parkersburg, Iowa, on Friday after defending a Republican-backed spending and tax cut package, dubbed as “the big, beautiful bill” by US President Trump, which includes $700 billion in cuts, including significant reductions to Medicaid.Speaking at a high school in north-central Iowa, Ernst was responding to a constituent who warned that people could die without health coverage.“People are not... well, we all are going to die,” Ernst replied, drawing audible groans from the crowd. She added, “For heaven’s sake, folks,” and stressed that the proposal would protect “those that are most vulnerable” and eligible for Medicaid.The controversial legislation narrowly passed the House last week by a single vote and now moves to the Senate. Ernst acknowledged that the Senate version will likely differ from the House bill.Republicans argue the bill’s new work requirements and stricter eligibility checks for able-bodied adults without dependents will preserve the program for those who need it most.Democrats, however, warn that millions could lose coverage. According to a preliminary estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional budget office, the plan could leave 8.6 million people without healthcare over the next decade.Video of Ernst’s comment quickly circulated on social media, with Democratic leaders using it to attack the GOP’s stance on healthcare.“This morning, Joni Ernst said the quiet part out loud: Republicans do not care about whether their own constituents live or die as long as the richest few get richer,” said Ken Martin, chair of the Democratic national committee.Ernst is up for re-election in 2026.","Republican senator Joni Ernst faced boos and groans from constituents during a tense town hall in Parkersburg, Iowa, on Friday.
