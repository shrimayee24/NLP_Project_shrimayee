Heat-related deaths up 23% globally since 1990s: Lancet,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/heat-related-deaths-up-23-globally-since-1990s-lancet/articleshow/124886275.cms,"NEW DELHI: Failure to curb the warming effects of climate change has seen the rate of heat-related deaths surge 23% since the 1990s, reaching an estimated 5,46,000 yearly deaths globally on average between 2012-21, according to Lancet Countdown Report on Health and Climate Change.Air pollution from wildfire smoke (PM 2.5) was linked to a record 1,54,000 deaths in 2024 alone, said the report. Underlining how the continued over-reliance on fossil fuels and failure to adapt to climate change is being paid for in people's lives, health and livelihoods, the report said the air pollution resulting from the continued burning of fossil fuels has resulted in a staggering 2.5 million deaths globally every year.It also said the global average transmission potential of dengue has risen by up to 49% since the 1950s, and linked even such a rise in India during 2015-24, compared to 1951-1960, to climate change.On India, the report, released Wednesday, said there were over 17,18,000 deaths attributable to anthropogenic air pollution (PM2.5) in 2022, an increase of 38% since 2010, whereas fossil fuels (coal and liquid gas) contributed to 7,52,000 (44%) of the deaths while coal alone accounted for 3,94,000 deaths, primarily from its use in power plants (2,98,000 deaths).It added the use of petrol for road transportation contributed to 2,69,000 deaths in India in 2022. ""In 2020-2024, wildfire smoke (PM2.5) was accountable for an annual average of 10,200 deaths in India, up by 28% from 2003-2012,"" it said.""In 2022, household air pollution due to the use of polluting fuels in India was associated with 113 deaths per 1,00,000. Mortality rates associated with household air pollution were higher in rural than urban areas...""India has, however, contested such findings, saying there is no conclusive data available to establish a direct correlation of death exclusively with air pollution. ""Air pollution is one of the many factors affecting respiratory ailments and associated diseases. Health is impacted by a number of factors which include food habits, occupational habits, socio-economic status, medical history, immunity, heredity, etc. , of individuals apart from the environment,"" environment ministry has told Parliament a number of times on the question of linking deaths exclusively with air pollution.Authored by 128 experts, the report noted the continued dependence on fossil fuels also puts an unbearable strain on countries' budgets, with govts collectively spending $956 billion on net fossil fuel subsidies in 2023. ""In 2024, people in India were exposed to 19.8 heatwave days each, on average. Of these, 6.6 days of exposure would not have been expected to occur without climate change,"" said the report, while noting how it impacted labour hours and posed a moderate or higher risk of heat stress during moderate outdoor activity.It said heat exposure resulted in a loss of 247 billion potential labour hours in 2024, a record high of 419 hour per person, and 124% more than in 1990-1999, in India.",The rate of heat-related deaths has risen 23% since the 1990s.

"Chinese behind most crypto, loan app rip-offs: ED report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/chinese-behind-most-crypto-loan-app-rip-offs-ed-report/articleshow/124886084.cms,"NEW DELHI: As the magnitude of cybercrime and the number of its victims continue to rise and has warranted Supreme Court's intervention, a report prepared by Enforcement Directorate shows that while domestic players have been primarily engaged in digital arrest and other such frauds, Chinese nationals have almost acquired dominance over loan app- and cryptocurrency-related rip-offs.The agency has already initiated a probe in many of these cases involving Chinese fraudsters, and an estimated Rs 28,000 crore in crime proceeds has been identified.The involvement of Chinese nationals and their control over illegal loan apps came to light after ED started probing LoanPro, FastCredit, SmartRupee and other similar loan apps over the past few years. The money trail in these cases showed that thousands of people were tricked across more than 20 states in the country. Many were bullied and blackmailed when they failed to meet the stringent repayment conditions, even leading to suicides.While these illegal ""instant loan"" apps charged hefty platform fees in the range of 30-40% of total loan amount, deducted at the time of disbursement, the term of the credit extended from 7 to 15 days.While Chinese nationals were found to be controlling these syndicates from abroad, their Indian associates ran the operations in the country from behind a veil of NBFCs and fintech and shell entities for laundering the crime proceeds.Indian and foreign payment gateways were also found involved in facilitating these transactions - some of them have already been questioned by the central agency.In many cases, the crime proceeds were converted into cryptocurrencies and siphoned off to China. In other cases, the perpetrators routed the booty as payments for fake imports from Hong Kong and other Chinese territories.According to the probe agency, these apps used a consortium of Chinese seed capital, NBFCs, fintech companies and payment aggregators. Shinebay Technologies, for instance, operated loan apps (LoanPro, FastCredit, SmartRupee, etc) that lent money at exorbitant interest rates for 7-15 days terms. Borrowers paid 30-40% of the loan amount at time of disbursement as platform fees. Private phone data of borrowers were hacked and used for blackmail in case of default, leading to several cases of suicide.In the case of HPZ Token, a cryptocurrency mining scheme, at least 10 Chinese nationals were found to have collected over Rs 2,200 crore from people across 20 states, and the alleged 'proceeds of crime' were sent out using payment gateways. As much as Rs 500 crore of this was frozen by ED with payment gateways after the scam was unearthed.In a case where investors were offered very high returns on investments using an online app 'LOXAM', the probe agency in July this year arrested a money changer who was found to have assisted a Chinese national in remittance of more than Rs 900 crore of ""proceeds of crime"" out of the country in a matter of just seven months.The arrested accused, Rohit Vij, converted Rs 903 crore into foreign currencies through his Ranjan Money Corp and KDS Forex, and helped Chinese national take the money out of the country.",Chinese nationals have almost acquired dominance over loan app- and cryptocurrency-related rip-offs.

"Indian detentions on US border drop 62%, lowest in four years",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-detentions-on-us-border-drop-62-lowest-in-four-years/articleshow/124885910.cms,"34,000 Caught Between Oct ’24 And Sept ’25

AHMEDABAD: US Customs and Border Protection intercepted 34,146 Indian nationals attempting illegal entry between Oct last year and this Sept, marking a 62% drop from 90,415 detentions during the previous fiscal. This constitutes the sharpest drop over the past four years in the number of Indians caught trying to enter the US illegally.Data released by the agency on Oct 28 shows Indian nationals now account for a significantly smaller share of total border detentions, compared to earlier years. In Sept, the final month of the US fiscal, authorities intercepted 1,147 Indians. In FY22, Indians accounted for 63,927 interceptions. The latest data is 47% lower.According to the report, total ""encounters"" on the US borders stood at 2.9 million in FY 2024, lower than the 3.2 million recorded in 2023, but marginally higher than the 2.7 million in 2022.Single adults made up the largest share of Indian nationals intercepted during FY25, totalling 31,480. Beside 2,552 family units, authorities detained 91 unaccompanied children and 23 minors travelling with adults.Immigration agents in north and central Gujarat, notorious for facilitating what are euphemistically called ""dunki routes"", seem to have slowed operations as families increasingly reconsider risks after the deaths of a family from Dingucha along the US-Canada border in 2022 and another near the Rio Grande in 2023.Officials identified the presence of minors at borders as an ""ongoing humanitarian concern"". The 91 unaccompanied children intercepted in FY25 reflect continued attempts by families relying on smuggling networks to send children in the hope of lenient treatment from US authorities.Migration researchers said the trend highlights both geopolitical enforcement changes and shifting aspirations. ""The American route is still viewed as a life-changing gamble. The decline in numbers does not mean the desire has ended - only that the risks have become clearer and costlier,"" a senior immigration official said.Employment stagnation in India, higher education aspirations and dollar-remittance dreams continue to draw aspirants, albeit with increased caution. The decline in detentions also reflects stricter border enforcement by US authorities, growing awareness about risks in migration-prone states like Gujarat, Punjab and Haryana, and changing smuggling patterns, officials said.","US Customs and Border Protection intercepted 34,146 Indian nationals attempting illegal entry between Oct last year and this Sept.

8th Pay Commission : Top things to know about Cabinet decision





In a big cheer for central government employees, PM Narendra Modi-led Union Cabinet on Tuesday approved the Terms of Reference for the 8th Central Pay Commission.The 8th Central Pay Commission’s proposals will impact the salaries of approximately 50 lakh central government staff members and 69 lakh retired personnel.In January 2025, the Government announced the formation of the 8th Central Pay Commission to review and propose revisions to the salaries and benefits of Central Government employees.According to the Cabinet release, the 8th Central Pay Commission Commission will function as a temporary entity, consisting of a Chairperson, one Part-Time Member, and one Member-Secretary. Its recommendations are due within 18 months of its establishment, with the possibility of submitting interim reports when specific recommendations are finalised.The 8th Pay Commission, led by former Supreme Court justice Ranjana Prakash Desai, will deliver a preliminary report to the government.Professor Pulak Ghosh from IIM Bangalore has been appointed as a part-time commissioner, whilst Petroleum Secretary Pankaj Jain will serve as the Member Secretary.When questioned about the implementation timing of the 8th Pay Commission's recommendations, I&B Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said, ""The specific date will be decided once the interim report comes in... But, mostly it should be January 1, 2026.""The 8th Central Pay Commission's deliberations will consider:i. The economic conditions in the country and the need for fiscal prudence;ii. The need to ensure that adequate resources are available for developmental expenditure and welfare measures;iii. The unfunded cost of non-contributory pension schemes;iv. The likely impact of the recommendations on the finances of the State Governments which usually adopt the recommendations with some modifications; andv. The prevailing emolument structure, benefits and working conditions available to employees of Central Public Sector Undertakings and private sector.Terms of Reference (TOR) serves as a framework document for a pay commission, establishing guidelines and parameters for preparing its report. It includes essential definitions, terms and conditions that guide the commission's work.The Terms of Reference is drafted by a Joint Consultative Machinery (JCM), with final approval from the Cabinet Committee under the Finance Ministry. The JCM includes union representatives from various ministries. From its 60 members, 12 are chosen for the standing committee. These selected members engage in discussions about TOR subjects with secretary-level government officials. The finalised TOR is then submitted for Cabinet approval.The significance of TOR lies in its function as a main reference document when a pay commission develops its recommendations.According to a TOI report, The government has kept the terms of reference undisclosed, yet the committee's primary responsibility involves examining the financial implications of non-contributory pension programmes.The central government's decision to transition from the National Pension System to Unified Pension Scheme for pre-2004 recruits lacks clarity on pension payment obligations.This absence of estimated liabilities has resulted in no budgetary allocations. Additionally, any increase in employee remuneration and benefits will inevitably lead to enhanced pension commitments.Central Pay Commissions are established periodically to assess and recommend changes to emoluments, retirement benefits and service conditions for Central Government employees.These recommendations are typically implemented on a ten-year cycle. Following this pattern, the 8th Central Pay Commission's recommendations would take effect from January 1, 2026.The 7th Pay Commission was established in February 2014, with its proposals taking effect from January 1, 2016.Central government staff receive dearness allowance (DA) to offset inflation's impact on their actual salary value. This DA rate undergoes regular revision every six months, with adjustments linked to inflation levels.","The 8th Central Pay Commission’s proposals will impact the salaries of approximately 50 lakh central government staff members and 69 lakh retired personnel.

Battle for Bihar: Sanjay Jha Reaffirms NDA Will Fight Assembly Polls Under Nitish Kumar's Leadership

NEW DELHI: In the run up to Bihar assembly poll announcement, Nitish Kumar was seen as NDA's weak link - his fitness under scrutiny, focus on CM's gaffes in and outside legislatures, the image of 'sushashan babu' fraying as sensational murders and collapse of bridges made national headlines allowing RJD-led Mahagathbandhan to home in on him.Halfway into the campaign, his challenger Tejashwi Yadav of RJD was goading voters by claiming that BJP will not repeat Nitish as CM if NDA retains power. But, as if on cue, BJP member and deputy CM Samrat Chaudhary said he will remain the CM, its poll in-charge and Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan insisted there is no vacancy for CM's post and other allies like Chirag Paswan and Jitan Ram Manjhi endorsed his leadership.As polling day nears, the JD(U) president remains not only NDA's most dependable face in state, but also someone whom large sections continue to look up to. His party's strength has declined in the assembly over successive elections but he continues to be seen as the alliance's most assured bridge to victory.His arch rival Lalu Prasad's derisive sobriquet of 'Paltu Ram', a colloquial turn on his frequent switches between the two rival alliances in state, appeared to have stuck for a while.But what has endured for his supporters is his deliverance of Bihar from the 15-year govt of Lalu and his wife Rabri Devi, a period dubbed as 'jungle raj' by NDA for its alleged lawlessness and retreat of state from various spheres of public life.Nitish is credited for restoration of basics of governance in his 20-long years in office, save for nine months of Jitan Ram Manjhi between 2014 and 2015. A quality road network, reliable power supply with electricity reaching almost every village by 2016, state's turn to the rule of law, and partial gains in school education and healthcare, at least at primary level, are considered undeniable successes of his era.While a sense of fatigue, poor employment opportunities with little let-up in migration from the state, and public frustration of those who want the state to have more than basic necessities pose a big challenge to him, what helps him is that the opposition's chief ministerial face Tejashwi continues to be weighed down with the legacy of his father.BJP's support is a big help as it ensures support of vocal upper castes and non-Yadav OBCs and EBCs among whom the saffron party has steadily made inroads. PM Narendra Modi has been warning voters in his rallies and virtual interactions against the return of 'jungle raj' of RJD, while offering wholehearted endorsement of Nitish.Lalu had famously said he might not have given people 'swarg' (heaven) but did render them 'swar' (voice), a suggestion that RJD govt empowered socially-deprived classes even though it scored poorly on governance. Nitish is seen to have succeeded in broadening the empowerment tent by pivoting govt's welfare focus to EBCs and most-deprived of Scheduled Castes, and provided an efficient administration as well. Focus on governance, building of infrastructure and a push for welfare schemes and empowerment initiatives like quotas for women and EBCs seem to be cushioning against attempts to turn his long tenure into a vulnerability.To his admirers, Nitish is also a rare politician who, despite his two decades in office, has managed to avoid any taint of corruption or charge of subversion of due process for rewarding his band of loyalists with govt jobs or contracts, an attribute brought into sharp relief when compared to a host of netas heading regional parties, not the least his arch rival Lalu.Despite lacking the advantage of an assured vote bank like Lalu, whose caste Yadavs account for over 14.2% of population, Nitish has assiduously weaved a support block comprising of sections of non-Yadav OBCs, EBCs and Scheduled Castes.In his multiple stints in office since 2005, the 74-year-old neta has cultivated women voters with a host of sops, from 35% quota in govt jobs to 50% quota in local bodies. The recent transfer of Rs 10,000 to over 1.20 crore of them being the latest outreach. His choice of keeping family members out of politics also casts him in a positive light for his supporters when no major regional party leadership can escape the charge of nepotism.",Nitish Kumar was seen as NDA's weak link in run up to Bihar assembly poll announcement.

"After KYC, compulsory KYV is here. And it’s driving people up the wall",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-kyc-compulsory-kyv-is-here-and-its-driving-people-up-the-wall/articleshow/124880566.cms,"Know Your Vehicle

What is KYV?

The Process

The Pain

If recurring KYCs was not enough, there’s now a KYV that you must go through if you happen to own a vehicle. Short for know your vehicle, this new process that is supposed to sanitise your FASTag is the latest compliance burden to be thrust on Indians.What was the need? Apparently, cases of misuse of FASTags — in some cases by truck drivers who were using tags meant for cars — convinced policy-makers that they needed a nationwide firewall to prevent a bunch of delinquents from misusing FASTags.It was rolled out as a mandatory process, beginning Oct 31, 2024, that requires all FASTag users to submit images of their vehicle and registration certificate to verify that the tag is linked to the correct vehicle. A National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) initiative, KYV was notified by National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). To prevent fraud. And if you thought this was a one-time process, you’re wrong. The verification must be repeated every three years so that the database stays always updated. Why? The possibility of misuse, and ingenious delinquents finding more ways to bend the system.A govt official explained that instances had emerged of people keeping loose FASTags in their pockets or wallets, instead of fixing them on their vehicle windshields, “leading to misuse”.“In some cases, tags issued for cars were used on trucks to pay lower toll charges. KYV will put an end to such misuse,” said another official.A source said since the main thrust of the FASTag rollout was to increase its usage so that toll collection became digitised, there may have been some laxity on the part of banks while issuing them. A KYV, said officials, will “help sanitise the system”.“Ensuring a FASTag is assigned to and affixed on the correct category of vehicle, and that it remains active, is crucial as we prepare to roll out multi-lane free flow (MLFF) system of tolling in which vehicles will neither need to stop, nor slow down as there will be no physical barriers, said a road transport ministry official.Govt aims to bring all national highways that have four or more lanes under MLFF tolling in the next 4-5 years. Therefore, according to officials, one vehicle, one tag is so important.Asked why not detect and disable fraudulent tags or penalise those using multiple tags on the same vehicle, there were no clear answers.According to the circular issued by NPCI, all FASTags need to comply with KYV norms. The process mandates linking the FASTag to the unique Vehicle Registration Number (VRN) and chassis number. FASTag issuers, meanwhile, need to follow the one-vehicle-one tag mandate and replace all tags that are more than five years old.So, anyone with a FASTag must upload their vehicle registration certificate (RC), take a picture of their vehicle from the front and upload that along with the FASTtag and vehicle registration number, besides a side image with the tag and vehicle axles. All these, mind you, must be clearly visible.Issuers need to verify this with the VAHAN database, customer mobile number, and data entered by the point-of-sale agent. FASTags without a valid KYV will get automatically deactivated.While there is great conviction among decision-makers that KYV is the right way to go, there are unpleasant surprises galore that the process is throwing up for people, from being stopped at toll plazas and being told FASTag isn’t working because of “non-compliance with KYV”, to encountering an upload process that involves multiple rounds of clicking photos and sharing documents. Adding to frustrations is its propensity to get stuck — a backend that is simply not prepared to handle such a mammoth job — and sending harried users back to square one.“I was told by a toll gate attendant that my FASTag isn’t working because KYV hasn’t been completed. So, I stopped and had to go through the entire process of taking photos and uploading documents from the toll plaza, just so I could drive on without a penalty despite having a legal and functional FASTag. Govt talks about ease of life, ease of travel, ease of business, etc. How is this ease of anything?” a Delhi resident who recently had to do a KYV at a toll plaza in NCR asked.Having seen people struggle through this, govt officials have started telling banks they should not deactivate tags without calling up customers and informing them about the KYV norm. Sources said the issuer bank, not NPCI, is involved in backend processing of KYV documents.A senior road transport ministry official admitted the process needs to be made easier for the people. Another official said that having a similar process across bank portals and a helpline to guide people could be useful.","KYV was notified by National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) to prevent fraud.

Gsat-7R, being considered the heaviest-ever communication satellite to be launched from Indian soil, will replace the aging satellite Gsat-7 (Rukmini), which is the backbone of naval communications on high seas at present.‘Rukmini’ has enabled secure real-time links between warships, submarines, aircraft and shore-based command centres across the Indian Ocean.With upgraded payloads, Gsat-7R or CMS-03 is designed to expand secure, multi-band communications for the Navy’s growing blue-water operations. Multi-band frequencies — UHF, S, C and Ku bands — will help transmit voice, video and data between warships, submarines and aircraft. The enhanced coverage will boost manifold India’s network-centric warfare capabilities and extend the Navy’s operational reach across critical maritime domains. CMS-03 will provide real-time communication for naval operations, air defence and strategic command control across a wide oceanic and terrestrial region.India's LVM3 rocket will be used to launch CMS-03, in what will be its fifth operational flight from Sriharikota.“The previous mission of LVM3 launched the Chandrayaan-3 mission, wherein India became the first country to land successfully near the lunar south pole,” Isro said in a statement.“CMS-03 is a multiband communication satellite that will provide services over a wide oceanic region, including the Indian landmass,” it said. It will provide sharper connectivity and increased bandwidth for civil, strategic and maritime users. Though Cyclone Montha has hit the Andhra Pradesh coast, a change in its direction has ensured that Isro’s satellite mission remains on schedule.The launch vehicle, LVM-3, has been fully assembled and integrated with the spacecraft and was moved to the launchpad on Oct 26 for further pre-launch operations, Isro said.Isro usually prefers launching heavier communication satellites from the European spaceport in French Guiana. This is the first time it will launch an around 4.4-tonne satellite from Indian soil. Isro had earlier launched Gsat-11, weighing 5,854 kg, from French Guiana using the services of Ariane-5 rocket, on Dec 5, 2018. While it is the heaviest satellite built by Isro so far, it was sent into space from a foreign spaceport.","Isro is set to hugely boost Indian Navy’s satellite-linked communication network. Gsat-7R (codeword CMS-03) will be launched from Sriharikota spaceport on Nov 2. The upgraded payloads are designed to expand secure, multi-band communications.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124887321,imgsize-615533,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-1.jpg"

The Centre has earned Rs 387 crore from the disposal of scrap gathered during the ongoing special cleanliness campaign, Union Minister Jitendra Singh said on Tuesday.The remarks came during a meeting of a group of ministers comprising Singh, the Union Minister of State for Personnel, to review the campaign. Youth Affairs Minister Mansukh Mandaviya and Civil Aviation Minister Rammohan Naidu also attended it.The high-level review held here on Tuesday focused on assessing the progress of cleanliness drives, file disposal, and innovative waste-to-wealth practices being implemented across ministries and departments under the campaign.Singh said the government's cleanliness drive has matured into a transformative national movement that blends cleanliness with efficiency, transparency, and innovation.He said that against a target of 7.56 lakh sites, ministries and departments have already covered 5.57 lakh sites, achieving 73.7 per cent progress by October 27, 2025, a statement issued by the Personnel Ministry said.""So far, the campaign has generated Rs 387.4 crore in revenue through disposal of scrap and e-waste, freed 148.19 lakh square feet of space, and weeded out 19.21 lakh files against the set targets,"" it said.As many as 5.51 lakh cases of public grievance have been disposed of out of a target of 7.04 lakh, while 12,402 appeals have been addressed out of 17,402 targeted, the statement said.Singh said that the campaign, which began on October 2 and is set to culminate on October 31, marks a decisive step in institutionalising cleanliness and record management across government offices.""Each version of this campaign has taken us to the next level -- from file disposal to freeing up office space, and now, to turning waste into wealth. What began as a cleanliness initiative has evolved into a behavioural and economic reform,"" he said.Since its inception in 2021, the cumulative outcomes of the special campaign series have been substantial, covering 19.61 lakh cleanliness sites, freeing 844.46 lakh square feet of office space, closing or weeding out 157.07 lakh files, and earning Rs 3,684 crore in revenue for the government.Singh said these achievements reflect not just administrative efficiency but also innovative thinking within government institutions.He said that new models are being implemented under the waste-to-wealth initiative, such as AIIMS' experiment in recycling bio-laboratory waste into reusable material, and the conversion of used cooking oil into low-cost fuel through NGO partnerships, according to the statement.""These are models of sustainability that also offer economic and social benefits. Our goal is to make waste management a part of our daily administrative and civic behaviour,"" the minister said.He also highlighted the collaboration between Tata Steel and government agencies in using steel plant by-products for eco-friendly road construction.""Such practices demonstrate how the private sector can contribute meaningfully to sustainable development,"" Singh added.Calling for sustained efforts beyond October 31, the minister urged ministries to adopt successful models and maintain cleanliness, efficiency, and grievance redressal as year-round priorities.""We are institutionalising cleanliness not as a symbolic exercise but as an ethos of governance.

NEW DELHI: Social media may be often seen as a peddler of fake news, exaggeration and misleading claims but it also stores enough unfiltered facts for govts to harness its reach in order to collect genuine feedback.In a unique move, the road transport ministry has directed the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and highway builders to have their own YouTube channels and upload fresh videos of projects at frequent intervals. TOI has learnt that road transport secretary V Umashankar Tuesday directed NHAI to upload videos on projects on its channel at different stages of development for public viewing and getting feedback.Speaking at an event of industry body CII, Umashankar said, “There have been instances when we get a lot of information and updates about projects and the problems being faced from videos uploaded by independent YouTubers. Some comments also give insight into issues...We are working on to make the uploading of videos as a part of project contract document.”Ministry officials said highway builders are required to submit videos shot using drones during construction stage to highway agencies, and hence, uploading them for public viewing won’t be an issue.They added that the objective of the initiative is to increase public participation and accountability of authorities.Addressing a session at the event, road transport minister Nitin Gadkari said he has issued instructions for installing hoardings with QR code for commuters to scan and see details of contractors and officials concerned, including their name, address and mobile numbers. “If people are paying toll, they deserve international-quality roads. Weather or poor bitumen cannot be excuses. If the surface is not comfortable, fix it — cost may increase but comfort is non-negotiable,” he added.Gadkari also said he has told officers that “if a road is bad and people are complaining about it on social media, take it seriously...From A to Z in road construction, we need ownership, sincerity, and a positive approach. Roads must be good, and they must stay good. Signboards should be put up clearly stating who is responsible”.He said institutionalising performance audits will help identify design and maintenance lapses while promoting accountability and rewarding quality work. “When audits are regular, transparency increases, and excuses decrease. That’s how we should work,” he added.",The road transport ministry has directed the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and highway builders to have their own YouTube channels.

Delhi Tries to Make It Rain With Cloud Seeding: A High-Stakes Weather Experiment to Fight Toxic Air

Third such experiment since 1957





What is cloud seeding?





In a bid to curb Delhi's air pollution crisis, the Delhi government conducted a cloud seeding trial in collaboration with IIT-Kanpur on Tuesday afternoon.The trial was aimed at inducing artificial rain to help settle dust and pollutants as Delhi’s AQI remained in the ‘very poor’ category. However, the results are still yet to be collated.Environment minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa said the Cessna aircraft took off from Kanpur, released eight fire flares, and covered areas such as Burari, north Karol Bagh, and Mayur Vihar before landing at the Meerut airfield. “The trial lasted for about half an hour. More such trials are planned over the next few days,” Sirsa said, PTI reported.This is the third such experiment since 1957 and was carried out after a gap of 53 years from the second experiment.Climate scientist Roxy Mathew Koll of the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune, told PTI that the first cloud seeding experiment in Delhi was conducted during the monsoon of 1957, and the second in the early 1970s.The 1971–72 trial, carried out from the National Physical Laboratory campus, covered a 25-km radius over central Delhi and used silver iodide particles released from ground-based generators to encourage rainfall.An IITM report noted that seeding was conducted on 11 days between December 1971 and March 1972, with 11 additional days kept as controls. Preliminary data showed an increase in rainfall on the seeded days, suggesting the potential effectiveness of artificial rain under suitable weather conditions.Since then, cloud seeding research in India has expanded.Under the Cloud Aerosol Interaction and Precipitation Enhancement Experiment (CAIPEEX) programme, IITM has studied clouds and rainfall patterns across the country. During CAIPEEX Phase IV (2017–2019) in Solapur, Maharashtra, scientists studied 276 clouds and found that hygroscopic seeding used in warm clouds increased rainfall by up to 46% in some areas and by an average of 18% over 100 sq km.Cloud seeding involves dispersing cloud-forming particles such as silver iodide or salts into clouds to enhance precipitation. The technique, used in over 50 countries, including China, the US, Russia, and Australia, is deployed for weather modification, rainfall enhancement, and pollution mitigation.The Delhi project, cleared by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and other departments, aims to evaluate whether artificial rain can be used as a short-term measure to reduce pollution during the winter in the coming years. The Delhi Cabinet had approved the plan on May 7, allocating Rs 3.21 crore for five trials, reported PTI.",The Delhi government conducted a cloud seeding trial in collaboration with IIT- Kanpur on Tuesday afternoon.

BJP blaming Punjab for air pollution in Delhi to defame state's farmers: CM Mann,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-blaming-punjab-for-air-pollution-in-delhi-to-defame-states-farmers-cm-mann/articleshow/124876517.cms,"Chief minister of Punjab Bhagwant Mann (Photo credit: PTI)





Delhi Smog Worsens Two Days After Diwali, AQI Hits Very Poor Levels

CHANDIGARH: Chief minister Bhagwant Mann on Tuesday accused the BJP of blaming Punjab for the air pollution in Delhi, and said it has turned the matter into a political issue just to defame the state's farmers.Addressing the media after chairing a Cabinet meeting here, Mann said blaming Punjab for Delhi's haze is not justifiable.If stubble smoke has to travel to Delhi from Punjab, the wind should blow from north to south, which is not the case right now, he said.""Moreover, 70-80 per cent of (paddy) crop has not yet arrived (in the mandis). Only 90 lakh metric tonnes have arrived, and much more is awaited,"" he said.""(Delhi minister Manjinder Singh) Sirsa sahab already said the smoke has reached Delhi. Why didn't he talk about Haryana? Haryana is located between Delhi and Punjab. They are not able to clean the Yamuna,"" Mann said, taking a dig at the BJP government in Delhi.Asking how Delhi's AQI crosses 400, 500, Mann said, ""Why does the smoke not cross Delhi? Does it know that it has to halt in Connaught Place or in any other particular spot in Delhi?""Hitting out at the BJP, the chief minister said, ""It is turning the matter into a political issue to defame the farmers.I have been saying right from day one that do not defame the 'Anndattas' (farmers), rather give a solution (to the stubble-burning issue).""Prime Minister Narendra Modi should convene a meeting of the states which face the stubble-burning problem, including Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan, so that they can put forward their views, Mann said.He also said that some alternative crops can be suggested to the farmers, which will ensure the same amount of money they get from paddy.""Why would the farmers sow paddy if they have an alternative? Rice is not even part of our staple diet,"" he said.Despite the devastating floods in Punjab recently, the state would contribute 170 lakh metric tonnes of rice to the central pool, Mann said. ""But they do not appreciate this,"" he said, taking a dig at the Centre.Notably, AAP leaders recently criticised Delhi Environment Minister Sirsa's remarks blaming the AAP dispensation in Punjab for the toxic haze over the national capital.The Delhi government also blamed the AAP in Punjab for the air pollution in the capital, alleging that the neighbouring state forced farmers to burn a record amount of paddy stubble on Diwali night (October 20).Addressing a press conference in Delhi recently, Sirsa accused the AAP of ""playing religion politics"".Sirsa claimed that while AAP leaders condemned the Delhi chief minister, the BJP and Sanatan Dharma followers over festival celebrations, the real reason behind the worsening air quality in the capital was large-scale stubble burning in Punjab.Replying to a question on the Election Commission's announcement to hold Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in 12 states and UTs, Mann said many political parties have objections against the exercise, which should be heard.""The matter of what documents will be accepted for identification came up before the Supreme Court,"" Mann said.""We don't want the SIR to be seen as (a means of) 'vote chori', where votes of its own people are added and votes going to other parties are deleted. That will be dangerous for democracy. The ECI should give a detailed reply on this issue,"" Mann said.Asked if the state received funds from the Centre's Rs 1,600 crore package for flood relief, Mann said he has been trying to get the funds.""They (Centre) are asking us to deduct funds coming under other schemes, saying they will be considered as part of the package,"" the chief minister claimed.""They (Centre) are trying to complete the package amount with funds received under other schemes. They said Rs 1,600 crore was just a token amount and more funds will follow. But so far, the token amount has not been given,"" he said.Asked about the time sought for a meeting with the prime minister, Mann said perhaps the prime minister has more activities in Bihar, where elections are due next month.""Pradhan Mantri saab is also a 'rally Pradhan Mantri', who forgets everything when there are elections in any state. He (Modi) has a six or seven-day programme in Bihar. We are even ready to meet him in Bihar if he gives us time.""We just want to share our state's problems and seek our rights. We can go to Patna, Gaya, Samastipur or wherever he says.

"Delhi Artificial Rain: No artificial rain after cloud seeding, Experts decode why Delhi’s Rs 3.2 crore experiment fell flat",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/artificial-rain-costly-and-unsustainable-measure-say-experts/articleshow/124880965.cms,"Delhi's attempt at tackling air pollution through cloud seeding has sparked criticism from environmental specialists who view this strategy as nothing more than a costly band-aid.

Delhi Tries to Make It Rain With Cloud Seeding: A High-Stakes Weather Experiment to Fight Toxic Air





NEW DELHI: Experts have termed Delhi govt's cloud seeding trials, held on Tuesday, a ""hugely expensive, temporary and unsustainable"" measure to deal with the capital's toxic pollution. Even if the artificial rain temporarily settles down the pollutants, the pollution will rise in one-two days, they say.According to the MoU signed between the Delhi environment department and IIT-Kanpur, the budget for cloud seeding is over Rs 3.2 crore for five trials —meaning one trial run costs Rs 64 lakh. Three trials have been done in north Delhi, and none of them led to any major rain. Delhi's air quality index (AQI) has been hovering in the ‘very poor' to ‘poor' range for the past few days.Read more: Flawed seeding? Why Delhi’s artificial rain experiment failed; Rs 1.9 crore spent on 3 sorties, IIT Kanpur blames low moisture Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment, said, ""The city has not yet recorded any substantial rainfall after cloud seeding. Even if the rains wash out the pollutants, the pollution will bounce back quickly. The impact lasts from hours to a couple of days.""Stressing that the initiative is not sustainable, she said, ""It cannot be done regularly for the entire winter season.Such investments need to target actual emission reduction from sources on the ground for sustained air quality improvement to protect public health.""Shahzad Gani, assistant professor at the Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, IIT Delhi, said that in the winter season, the weather in Delhi is typically very dry, with very little moisture in the air. The only time it usually rains during winter is when a western disturbance influences the plains.""If it rains due to a western disturbance, there is no point in carrying out cloud seeding. And if an intense spell of rain occurs simultaneously during the cloud seeding process, causing very heavy rain and damage to life and property — even if it is actually unrelated to cloud seeding — who will take responsibility for it?"" he said, adding. ""Why do we adopt silver-bullet technologies like smog towers, smog guns and cloud seeding? There is a need to systematically reduce emissions from different sources. ""Sunil Dahiya, founder and lead analyst of think tank EnviroCatalysts, said addressing air quality requires tackling sector-specific emissions from transport, power and construction. Without that, no real impact can be achieved, he added. ""Cosmetic measures may create short-term visibility benefits but are not sustainable solutions. The focus should instead be on coordinated action across states and agencies through an airshed-based approach that targets the actual sources of pollution,"" he said.Activist Bhavreen Kandhari said cloud seeding can only enhance rainfall when the atmosphere is moisture-deficient and conditions are marginal for precipitation. ""The skies were already rich with moisture, and a western disturbance was forecast to bring natural rain. Under such circumstances, cloud seeding adds little scientific value; it becomes a costly experiment chasing what nature is already prepared to deliver. Clean air will not come from artificial rain, but from sustained reductions in emissions, dust control, and responsible policy,"" said Kandhari.","The budget for cloud seeding is over Rs 3.2 crore for five trials.

A call for safer driving and shared responsibility





Abu Dhabi Police have detailed the complete framework for handling traffic black points, licence suspensions, and rehabilitation options for drivers, particularly highlighting stricter regulations for motorists under the age of 21 who hold probationary licences. The comprehensive explanation was delivered by Lieutenant Colonel Saeed Khalfan Al Kaabi, from the Traffic Points Program Section at the Police Follow-up and Aftercare Department, during an appearance on the ‘Amn wa Aman’ (Safety and Security) programme, broadcast by Abu Dhabi Police and reported by Emarat Al Youm.The latest advisory outlines how traffic points are assigned, what thresholds trigger suspension or cancellation, and the steps motorists can take to recover their licences or reduce black points. It also introduces an ongoing initiative aimed at educating drivers and reinforcing safer road practices across the emirate.The black points system, formally known asis part of the UAE’s Federal Traffic Law framework, created to deter unsafe driving and promote compliance. Each traffic offence carries a set number of points according to its severity, from violations such as speeding, tailgating, or using a phone while driving, to more serious offences like running a red light or endangering lives.Under the Federal Traffic Law and its executive regulations, these black points remain on a driver’s record for one year before being cleared, provided the total does not exceed 24 points at any one time. Reaching or surpassing this limit can result in temporary suspension or full revocation of the driving licence, depending on the case.Each violation carries a specific number of points depending on its severity. For example:If a driver accumulates 24 points within a year, their driving licence is either suspended or revoked, depending on the type of licence held and whether the offence is a repeat occurrence.Al Kaabi emphasised that these rules aim not to punish but to encourage responsible behaviour on the road. Drivers who reach the limit must undergo corrective measures before regaining their driving privileges.Drivers under the age of 21, holding, face more stringent consequences upon reaching the cumulative limit of 24 traffic points. According to Al Kaabi, such drivers have two choices:If the same probationary driver again reaches the cumulative 24-point limit during the trial period, their licence is cancelled entirely. They are then barred from applying for a new driving licence for one full year from the date of cancellation.Al Kaabi reiterated that the repeated accumulation of points reflects unsafe driving patterns and that the cancellation measure aims to prevent habitual offenders from endangering public safety.Motorists aged 21 or older, who hold, are subject to slightly different penalties under the same law. When such drivers first reach the cumulative limit of 24 points, they can either:However, if the same motorist again accumulates 24 points within less than a year of the first violation, their licence will be suspended for six months. To recover it, they must again attend the rehabilitation course and pay AED 2,400.These provisions apply equally to all permanent licence holders across the emirate, reinforcing the importance of consistent compliance with traffic laws.Beyond licence suspension and recovery, Abu Dhabi Police also provide services for drivers seeking totheir black points before reaching the 24-point threshold. As explained by Al Kaabi on the ‘Safety and Security’ programme, motorists with between 8 and 23 traffic points on their record can voluntarily enrol in a traffic points reduction course.This optional programme allows eligible drivers to deduct eight traffic points from their total. To qualify, participants must:The course focuses on raising awareness about safe driving behaviour, explaining how the black points system works, and highlighting the consequences of repeated offences. It also includes discussions on real-world case studies of common violations recorded by electronic surveillance systems.Two main rehabilitation programmes are available:Al Kaabi clarified that both initiatives aim to educate drivers rather than simply penalise them, fostering a culture of shared responsibility on the road.Applications and attendance for these rehabilitation and reduction services can be completed at several dedicated centres operated by Abu Dhabi Police, including:Registration typically runs from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m., and drivers must first ensure that their traffic points are correctly reflected in their records before applying.Additionally, a special initiative launched by Abu Dhabi Police runs from 20 October to 20 November 2025, operating daily from 4:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. at the Mushrif Mall Centre (first floor, Police platform). This month-long programme allows motorists to either reduce their black points or reinstate a suspended licence through in-person sessions.The process involves:There is no online registration or virtual participation option for these courses; physical attendance is mandatory to ensure participants engage directly with instructors and benefit from interactive training.Concluding his address, Lieutenant Colonel Saeed Khalfan Al Kaabi urged all drivers to be partners in promoting road safety, emphasising that “safety is everyone’s responsibility”. He called on motorists to adhere strictly to traffic regulations, avoid violations that accumulate black points, and act as role models in compliance and awareness.He underscored that the black points system and its accompanying rehabilitation measures are not purely punitive but designed to reform driving behaviour, reduce accident risks, and instil a lasting culture of responsibility on the roads of Abu Dhabi.","The black points system, formally known asis part of the UAE’s Federal Traffic Law framework.

Kenya’s sacred Mrima Hill turns into a real-world ‘Avatar’: The hidden $62 billion mineral war drawing in the US and China,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/kenyas-sacred-mrima-hill-turns-into-a-real-world-avatar-the-hidden-62-billion-mineral-war-drawing-in-the-us-and-china/articleshow/124845288.cms,"Source: SCMP

Mrima Hill becomes ground zero in the global hunt for critical minerals



China FIRES WARNING SHOTS At Trump Before Xi Jinping Bilateral; 'You Cannot Stop...' | WATCH

Mrima Hill’s local community struggles to protect their sacred forest



Kenya’s mining reforms aim for growth amid corruption and governance concerns



Mrima Hill community split between hopes for development and fears of losing their land



Cultural heritage and environmental concerns





Mrima Hill in Kenya’s coastal region has emerged as a focal point of global interest and growing local tension. Vast deposits of rare earth minerals lie beneath its lush forest, vital for producing smartphones, electric vehicles and renewable energy systems. Major global powers like the United States, China and Australia have been attracted towards the valuable resources, all seeking to secure access to minerals critical for the world’s transition to advanced technologies and low-carbon industries. While the international race for these resources intensifies, the surrounding communities face uncertainty over their land, environment, and future, as Mrima Hill becomes a symbol of both opportunity and potential exploitation in Kenya’s quest for sustainable development, highlighting the urgent need for fair resource management and transparent benefit-sharing with local populations.Mrima Hill, located near the Indian Ocean in Kwale County, covers about 390 acres. It may look like an ordinary forest, but beneath the soil lies a treasure trove of rare earth minerals and niobium. A 2013 report by Cortec Mining Kenya, a subsidiary of the UK and Canada-based Pacific Wildcat Resources, estimated that these deposits were worth approximately 62.4 billion dollars. Niobium, one of the key minerals found in Mrima Hill, is used to make stronger steel and in advanced technologies that support green energy transitions.The hill’s enormous economic potential has attracted foreign attention. In June, Marc Dillard, then the interim US ambassador to Kenya, visited the site, signalling Washington’s growing interest in African mineral reserves. At the same time, reports emerged of Chinese nationals attempting to access the forest, though local guards prevented their entry. Recently, Australian companies RareX and Iluka Resources announced plans to explore rare earth mining in the region, further intensifying the international competition.This sudden global interest has brought both hope and anxiety to the people living around Mrima Hill.The communities surrounding Mrima Hill are primarily made up of the Digo people, an ethnic group with deep cultural and spiritual ties to the forest. For generations, the forest has provided food, medicine, and spiritual refuge. It is home to sacred shrines, medicinal plants, and wildlife that form an integral part of local traditions.However, the promise of mineral wealth has also become a source of fear and division. Many residents worry that they will lose their land or receive nothing from the profits that foreign companies hope to make. “People come here with big cars, but we turn them away,” said Juma Koja, a community guard. His words reflect a deep mistrust that stems from years of failed promises and opaque deals.In 2013, the Kenyan government revoked Cortec Mining Kenya’s licence, citing environmental and licensing violations. Cortec claimed it was punished for refusing to pay a bribe to the then-mining minister, Najib Balala, a charge Balala denied. The company’s repeated court appeals were unsuccessful. This controversy has left a lasting sense of betrayal in the community and reinforced the perception that mining often benefits outsiders rather than locals.Kenya’s mining sector has long struggled with corruption, poor regulation, and lack of transparency. In 2019, the government temporarily banned new mining licences to combat illegal activities and environmental damage. However, the rising global demand for rare earths, combined with China’s restrictions on mineral exports, has renewed Kenya’s interest in reviving the sector.This year, the Ministry of Mining announced a major reform programme to restore investor confidence and strengthen regulation. The reforms include tax incentives, simplified licensing procedures, and promises of greater transparency in the approval process. The government aims to increase mining’s contribution to Kenya’s economy from less than one percent of GDP to ten percent by 2030.Experts, however, caution that without strong institutions and fair enforcement of the law, the reforms could fail to bring lasting benefits. Daniel Weru Ichang’i, a retired economic geology professor at the University of Nairobi, warned that many Kenyans have an overly optimistic view of mining. “There’s a romantic idea that mining is a quick path to wealth,” he said. “But corruption and poor governance make this industry very risky. If Kenya wants to benefit, the law must be respected, and the national interest must come before personal gain.”Despite these fears, not everyone in the community opposes mining. Some see it as a rare opportunity to escape poverty. Domitilla Mueni, treasurer of the local community forest association, has been improving her land by planting trees and crops to increase its value in anticipation of potential land purchases by mining companies. “Why should we die poor while we have minerals?” she asked, expressing the hopes of those who believe mining could bring development, schools, and better infrastructure to the region.This divide reflects a broader dilemma faced by many resource-rich countries: how to balance economic growth with environmental protection and community rights. Kenya’s challenge is not only to attract foreign investment but also to ensure that the benefits of its natural wealth reach its people without destroying their heritage or environment. The conflict surrounding Mrima Hill is a microcosm of a larger global struggle for control over rare earth minerals. As the demand for these materials grows, Africa has become a new battleground for geopolitical influence between Western nations and China.For the people of Mrima Hill, mining threatens more than just land ownership. The forest is intertwined with their cultural and spiritual identity. It contains sacred groves used for ceremonies and healing, as well as unique plants and animals that have been part of their way of life for centuries.","Mrima Hill in Kenya’s coastal region has emerged as a focal point of global interest and growing local tension.

'Sky Stadium' in Saudi Arabia: Football venue 350m above ground - Fake or real?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/more-sports/others/sky-stadium-in-saudi-arabia-football-venue-350m-above-ground-fake-or-real/articleshow/124887889.cms,"Saudi Arabia had proposed a Sky Stadium as part of its 2034 World Cup bid but official visual is unconfirmed.

Is the idea real or fake?

If social media is to be believed Saudi Arabia has plans to construct the world's first sky stadium, suspended 350 meters above ground, as part of its ambitious infrastructure development for hosting the 2034 FIFA World Cup . As per digital media, the NEOM Sky Stadium, set to begin construction in 2027 and complete by 2032, will be powered by solar and wind energy with a seating capacity of 46,000 people.The stadium will be integrated into The Line, a linear smart city within NEOM, showcasing Saudi Arabia's commitment to futuristic architecture and sustainability. The project is part of Saudi Arabia's larger plan to develop 15 cutting-edge stadiums for the 2034 World Cup tournament.""The stadium is suspended at an astonishing 350 meters (1,150 feet) above the desert floor within the futuristic NEOM city of The Line,"" stated Construction Review magazine.The project has gained attention on social media platforms, with viral images showing a stadium perched atop a skyscraper. However, reports indicate these images may be digitally altered and do not reflect official designs.Sanjiv Goenka, owner of IPL franchise Lucknow Super Giants and ISL club Mohun Bagan Super Giants, shared the idea on his X account with a caption, ""The idea of a stadium in the sky captures the essence of modern ambition.Sustainability, technology, and creativity are no longer separate pursuits. They are now converging to shape the world ahead.""The King Salman International Stadium in Riyadh stands as another significant development in Saudi Arabia's World Cup preparations. Arab News reported that it ""will become the largest stadium in the Kingdom, with a capacity of 92,760, when it is completed in 2029.""FIFA has reportedly given preliminary endorsement to the Sky Stadium project, recognising its potential to establish new benchmarks for environmentally friendly sports venues. The stadium's location near the Health and Well-Being District and University aims to create a sports-focused neighbourhood.The smart city of NEOM, which will house the sky stadium, is scheduled for completion by 2045. However, the section containing the stadium will be operational by 2032, two years before Saudi Arabia hosts the World Cup.The project faces considerable engineering challenges due to its height and location, requiring innovative solutions for safety and accessibility. The broader NEOM initiative has experienced delays, potentially affecting the stadium's timeline, though World Cup-related priorities remain unchanged.The stadium project aligns with Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030, which aims to diversify the country's economy and boost tourism.

Back-To-Back Attempts At Cloud Seeding; Sirsa Calls It A Huge Step To Mitigate Pollution

3 Trials, Rs 1.9cr, 0.3mm: Wait for rain continues





NEW DELHI: The Delhi govt attempted two trials of cloud seeding on Tuesday, but neither led to any rainfall in the city. However, IIT Kanpur, which executed the project, claimed that neighbouring areas received negligible rainfall - Noida (0.1 mm) and Greater Noida (0.2 mm) at 4pm attributing the data to a private app, Windy.Delhi environment minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa said, ""According to expert forecasts, rain after seeding could occur anytime in next 24 hours, depending on cloud moisture. Initial radar readings and ground observations recorded light rainfall at Delhi-Noida Border around 4pm, indicating some positive response from the seeded clouds.""In the first trial, the Cessna aircraft of IIT Kanpur took off at 12.13pm from Kanpur and landed at Meerut at 2.30pm. The seeding points included Khekra, Burari, north Karol Bagh, Mayur Vihar, Sadakpur and Bhojpur. The second sortie started from Meerut carrying 4kg of seeding material and landed back at the same place. The main waypoints were the same as the first sortie.The second trial started at 3.45 pm, with the first seeding at Khekra at 4.08 pm, followed by Burari, Mayur Vihar, Pavi Sadakpur, Noida, Bhojpur, Modinagar and Meerut, before landing back at 4.45 pm, an IIT Kanpur statement said.Each flare weighed about 0.5 kg, with eight flares released per sortie, dispersing a tested mixture designed to enhance precipitation potential. Reported humidity levels in seeded clouds ranged from 15-20% - lower than ideal, but sufficient for a scientifically meaningful test. The operation lasted about one and a half hours for each sortie, ensuring consistent coverage,"" said Sirsa.Following the trials, IIT Kanpur too said the moisture content remained low at 10-15%, which is not an ideal condition for seeding. ""The PM2.5 was 221, 230, and 229 reported from Mayur Vihar, Karol Bagh, and Burari, respectively, before cloud seeding, which got reduced to 207, 206, and 203 micrograms per cubic metre respectively, after the first seeding. Similarly, PM10 was 207, 206, 209 micrograms per cubic metre, which got reduced to 177, 163, 177 micrograms per cubic metre at Mayur Vihar, Karol Bagh, and Burari, respectively. Given that winds were negligible, one possible explanation is that the denser moisture content created due to seeding particles has helped in settling down a portion of these particles, which translated to these reductions,"" said a report by IIT Kanpur.With this, three cloud-seeding trials have been conducted, with the first having taken place on Oct 23, which again did not lead to any rain. According to the MoU between the Delhi environment department and IIT Kanpur, the budget for cloud seeding is nearly Rs 3.21 crore for five trials. ""However, IIT Kanpur said it will conduct up to nine trials from this budget. It said it is a research institute and not a profit-making institute and hence it will conduct maximum trials to help people breathe good air,"" said Sirsa.The minister said this is among India's biggest scientific steps for urban air quality control, proving Delhi's resolve to confront legacy pollution challenges head on. ""The govt's proactive approach, thanks to the support from chief minister Rekha Gupta and guidance from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, will ensure effective and transparent climate action for the citizens,"" said Sirsa.IIT Kanpur director Manindra Agrawal told TOI, ""As per my knowledge, it did not rain in Delhi. The moisture content was low. However, our team has conducted different data for better understanding. Two additional attempts for cloud seeding will be conducted on Wednesday.""Experts doubted whether the cloud seeding process can lead to a reduction in air quality in absence of rain. Mukesh Khare, professor emeritus at IIT Delhi's Civil Engineering Department said natural rain can reduce PM2.5 concentration depending on the raindrop size, their density and fall velocity. ""During the rainy season, rain washes out the pollutants and suppresses them to the ground. However, clouds are generally devoid of humidity during winters in Delhi. A mixture of silver iodide and other contents was released to make some reaction so that enough water vapour can be generated into the clouds, making them unable to hold those drops. Since only negligible rain occurred, it means cloud seeding was not able to generate enough water vapour.""He added that a mere increase in humidity within the clouds may not suppress the particles. ""Humidity only can make the particles heavier. However, PM2.5 particles are very small. Unless there is a force, humidity cannot settle down PM2.5 particles. Hence, reduction in PM2.5 may have occurred due to other reasons.""","The Delhi govt attempted two trials of cloud seeding on Tuesday, but neither led to any rainfall in the city.

Bengaluru: After days of sparring over the controversial tunnel road project, Bangalore South MP Tejasvi Surya met deputy chief minister D K Shivakumar on Tuesday to discuss alternatives to ease the city's traffic chaos. Surya pitched for scrapping the ""car-only"" multi-crore tunnel road project and suggested investing instead in mass transport like the Metro, but it was Shivakumar's rebuttal that stumped all.Countering Surya's argument that strengthening public transport could discourage private vehicle use, Shivakumar reacted to the media: ""Can I stop you from bringing your vehicle? It's a matter of social responsibility. People prefer to travel in their own vehicles with their families. Can we prevent them from using their cars? If needed, MPs can appeal to their constituents to leave their cars at home and use public transport. Let us see how many actually follow that. Today, people even hesitate to marry a boy who doesn't own a car."" He emphasised that MPs need awareness about such social realities.Earlier, Surya had argued that the proposed tunnel would cater to just 1,800 cars per hour in one direction compared to a Metro line that could move nearly 69,000 passengers for the same cost.""We should focus on moving more people, not more cars,"" he said, underlining that the tunnel road would serve only a small section of commuters while robust public transport could offer a long-term solution to Bengaluru's chronic traffic issues. The MP proposed a comprehensive citywide transport plan comprising a 300km Metro network with three-minute train frequency, a 314km suburban rail system, and modern tram services for short-distance travel within dense neighbourhoods. He also suggested introducing high-frequency shuttle services every 5-10 minutes along the Outer Ring Road (ORR), linking KR Pura (Purple Line) and Silk Board (Yellow Line), to improve last-mile connectivity and reduce car dependency. Surya further demanded that the state govt expedite the formation of Bengaluru Metropolitan Land Transport Authority (BMLTA) and appoint a dedicated chairperson to coordinate and streamline the city's various transport agencies and infrastructure projects.Reacting to Surya's proposals, Shivakumar said that instead of merely giving ""free advice,"" Bengaluru's MPs should focus on convincing the Prime Minister to allocate more central funds for the city's infrastructure development. ""Surya has made some suggestions. He said the tunnel road is mainly for cars and wants the Metro network to be expanded. We have no objection to that,"" Shivakumar said. ""But I told him to get more funds from the central govt for the Metro. Right now, we receive only 10-12% of the total project cost. I urge all Bengaluru MPs to meet the PM — I'll join them too.""Responding to questions about the tunnel road's alignment near Lalbagh, Shivakumar clarified that the project would not consume six acres of land within the botanical garden. ""The entry and exit points for the tunnel will be located on the edge of Lalbagh. If not here, I asked him (Surya) to suggest an alternative location,"" he said. ""He mentioned that many countries are not in favour of tunnel roads, but we cannot rely on just one person's opinion. ""Clarifying his earlier ""empty trunk"" remark, the DCM said it referred to a shortage of funds, not people. ""Any project requires money. Solutions don't emerge merely from tweets or criticisms,"" he explained. ""Anyone can give suggestions — oppose tunnels, demand more buses, or call for Metro expansion — but how many will actually travel by bus themselves? Can we build a Metro line on every street?""","Bengaluru South MP Tejasvi Surya met deputy chief minister D K Shivakumar on Tuesday to discuss alternatives to ease the city's traffic chaos. He pitched for scrapping the ""car-only"" multi-crore tunnel road project and suggested investing instead in mass transport like the Metro.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124879988,imgsize-50604,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/dk-shivakumar-to-mass-transport-fans-public-transport-is-fine-but-try-finding-a-bride-without-owing-a-car.jpg"

Bill Gates calls for shift in climate aid





Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates recently said that if given a choice between eradicating malaria and a tenth of a degree increase in warming, he will choose the latter option. In a memo released today, October 28, Gates said that the world’s primary goal should instead be to prevent suffering, specifically in the world’s poorest countries. “I’ll let the temperature go up 0.1 degree to get rid of malaria. People don’t understand the suffering that exists today,” he told reporters.Gates emphasized that climate change is a serious problem. However, it alone won’t be the end of civilization adding that scientific innovation may likely curb it. Gates stated that it’s instead time for a “strategic pivot” in the global climate fight: from focusing on limiting rising temperatures to fighting poverty and preventing disease.The memo comes a month before the United Nations climate change conference in Brazil. During a roundtable discussion with reporters ahead of the release of the 17-page memo, Gates said “If you think climate is not important, you won’t agree with the memo.If you think climate is the only cause and apocalyptic, you won’t agree with the memo. It’s kind of this pragmatic view of somebody who’s, you know, trying to maximize the money and the innovation that goes to help in these poor countries. ”Bill Gates believes the world’s progress in clean energy has outpaced expectations, thanks to faster innovation and the rise of artificial intelligence. He said affordable solar and wind energy are now replacing coal, oil, and gas plants, helping prevent worst-case climate scenarios.However, Gates warned that funding to help poorer nations cope with climate change is shrinking, as wealthy countries — led by the United States — reduce their foreign aid budgets. “Gavi, a public-private partnership started by my foundation that buys vaccines, will have 25% less money for the next five years compared to the past five years,” Gates said. “Gavi can save a life for a little more than $1,000.”He stressed that vaccines are even more vital in a warming world because “children who aren’t dying of measles or whooping cough will be more likely to survive when a heat wave hits or a drought threatens the local food supply.”Gates pointed to research by the University of Chicago Climate Impact Lab showing that projected deaths from climate change fall by more than 50% when accounting for future economic growth. “Health and prosperity are the best defense against climate change,” he said.Under these conditions, Gates argued that development aid should be spent where it can have the biggest impact. “If you have something that gets rid of 10,000 tons of emissions, that you’re spending several million dollars on,” he said, “that just doesn’t make the cut.”","Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates recently said that if given a choice between eradicating malaria and a tenth of a degree increase in warming, he will choose the latter option.

Read TCS clarification on M&S cyber attack

In response to the article published by ‘The Telegraph’ Newspaper in the UK on October 26, 2025, titled “M&S ousts Indian outsourcer accused of £300m cyberattack failures”, a statement of the Company is given below:

“The report published by The Telegraph is misleading, with factual inaccuracies including the size of the contract and the continuity of TCS’ work for Marks & Spencer (M&S). As both M&S and TCS have clarified, the service desk contract with M&S followed a regular competitive RFP process initiated in January 2025, with M&S opting to proceed with other partners much prior to the cyber incident in April 2025. These matters are hence clearly Unrelated.

The commercial aspect of the service desk area also represents an insignificant part of TCS’ overall engagement with M&S. TCS continues to work on numerous other areas, in its role as a strategic partner for M&S and is proud of this longstanding partnership.

On the Cyber incident itself, as clarified previously, TCS had conducted a scan of its own networks and systems and been able to conclude that the vulnerabilities have not originated from there. TCS does not provide cyber security services to M&S. This is a service that is provided by another partner.”

This is for your information and record.

The attack disrupted M&S online shopping with customers reporting glitches in M&S stores. Specifically, contactless card payments and “Click & Collect” order pickups were hit due to the attack.According to reports in early June, M&S CEO Stuart Machin received an email from hacking group DragonForce using an employee email account. The email confirmed that M&S was hacked by the ransomware group, who allegedly encrypted all the company’s servers.The ransomware group used a double extortion method. They first got into the system through a social engineering phone call and spent time collecting sensitive customer data. After stealing the data, they launched the DragonForce ransomware to lock the systems and demand money.As per estimates, the cyber attack hit this year's profits by around £300 million. The retailer resumed online orders after a 46-day hiatus following the cyberattack.","TCS has refuted a recent report alleging that leading British retail company Marks & Spencer (M&S) has ended contact with the IT firm over a £300 million cyberattack.

‘Musk’s demands to increase sales pushed resignations’







John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months. His exit marks the latest senior-level departure from Elon Musk ’s executive ranks and comes just months after he was viewed by industry insiders as a potential successor to former CEO Linda Yaccarino, a report has said.Nitti, a former Verizon executive, left X on Friday (October 24), The Financial Times reported citing people familiar with the matter. His departure follows Yaccarino’s resignation in July, after which her duties were divided among several leaders, including Nitti.Nitti’s exit reflects an ongoing wave of senior executive departures since Musk’s AI startup, xAI, took over the social media platform in March. The resignations have reportedly been attributed to frustration over Musk’s sudden strategy changes and the difficulty of executing objectives under his management style.Other recent high-profile departures include:It is also being reported that there has been a constant pressure to boost revenues, which, combined with Musk’s simultaneous spending of billions on infrastructure for the AI race, fueled the resignations.The report said that advertising executives like Nitti have faced intense demands from Musk to increase sales, even as many advertisers have pulled back. Brands were deterred by Musk’s decision to relax content moderation standards based on his ""free speech"" ideals.The report cites sources as saying that Nitti was among sales leaders who grew frustrated with Musk’s management of the advertising business. Following the CEO’s disengagement from the Trump administration this past summer, Musk began making more unilateral decisions around advertising without consulting his leadership team.While xAI has recently secured new media partnerships, including one with Disney, and claims improving advertising metrics due to its AI technology, some advertisers privately complain they felt pressured to spend after X sued several brands for allegedly undertaking an ""illegal boycott.""","John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months.

Helping GF scale, innovate





As we were starting to write this story, we had to look up his full name. Jitendra Chaddah. Hardly anyone calls him that. Everyone knows him simply as JC.JC’s been quite the star in the Indian semiconductor industry for years. And as India now seeks to strengthen its semiconductor ecosystem, the talent and capabilities that JC’s building as the country head of Global Foundries (GF) – one of the world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturers – and as head of its global fab engineering services could prove to be invaluable.We met him recently at his office in Bengaluru, where some 1,200 people are working on radio frequency and satellite communication tech, helping India’s fabless chip design companies, and, perhaps most interestingly, managing GF’s foundries in the US, Europe and Singapore remotely. But before getting into that, a little about JC.JC grew up in Gwalior. Did a Masters in computer applications at Gwalior’s Madhav Institute of Technology and Science. He moved to Canada to work with one of the then best-known graphic tools companies, Corel. “I was among the developers of CorelDraw. My name used to feature in the list of developers on its website,” he says.And then he started a career with Intel – across the US, Mexico and India – that lasted 26 years.He briefly did technical roles, including developing internet security applications. But soon, he was drafted into a team to identify global locations where Intel could do software development. And the team found India to be where Intel could scale software development the most.JC moved to India for a couple of years to help start the operation, and to set up structures and compliances necessary to ensure a sustainable organisation. Some friends advised him against moving out of tech and into operations, but by then, he had done an MBA, was enjoying his India stint, and when he returned to the US, he was appointed technical assistant to Intel’s then CIO, Stacy Smith. The initial months of shadowing the CIO, JC says, were unbelievably tough. He felt he just could not keep up with Smith’s expectations. But then he found his groove. And since Smith was also sales leader for Europe, JC travelled extensively with him and got a breadth of experience he could not have imagined.This was followed by an 18-month stint in Guadalajara in Mexico, where Intel was establishing an India-like setup. And then a health issue with his father brought him back to India, where he did multiple roles in Intel, helping grow it into one of the chip giant’s biggest sites globally.Three years ago, the GF role came along – just when globally there was an intense race among leading countries to establish semiconductor fabs, and reduce the overwhelming dependence on China/Taiwan. Among the top 5 global fabs, GF is the only US headquartered one, and the company is in the midst of making massive investments.JC says his first job was to define what India would do for GF. And the team decided no other site could possibly provide the kind of scaling GF was looking at. Towards this, the company has been aggressively hiring – the number of people doubled in the last two years, mostly electronics, electrical and computer science engineers; established five centres of excellence (CoEs); and set up global processes and standards.Two initiatives are particularly striking. One is the effort to manage foundries remotely. India, together with Malaysia, is a hub to provide 24/7 support for global fabrication operations – monitoring the productivity of the fabs, the defects emerging, and digitally correcting the issues, or alerting people at the fab. People at this hub have to be as competent as those at the fab, and that, JC says, required significant training. The hub also needed independent global certifications, since they are dealing with things like critical automotive safety chips. The hubs have brought multiple efficiency improvements and cost benefits.The other initiative JC is passionate about is what GF calls India Foundry Programme. Under this, GF provides its product development kits and experts to Indian fabless design companies to fast-track solutions they are building. “We also provide MPWs (multiproject wafers), a service that allows multiple customers to share a single silicon wafer for chip fabrication. Normally, without volumes, it’s very hard to get test chips done,” JC says. MPWs significantly reduce costs for design startups.","Jitendra Chaddah is the country head of Global Foundries (GF) and head of its global fab engineering services.

Severance package and support for affected employees





Amazon is preparing to eliminate 800 to 1,000 positions in India as part of a sweeping global restructuring driven by artificial intelligence adoption, The Economic Times reported on Wednesday, marking one of the largest workforce reductions at the e-commerce giant’s Indian operations.The layoffs will span critical functions including finance, human resources, and technology, with employees reporting to Amazon’s global teams facing the steepest cuts, ET reported citing sources. The India job cuts are part of a broader plan to reduce approximately 14,000 corporate roles worldwide, announced by Beth Galetti, Senior Vice President of People Experience and TechnologyWhen contacted about the India-specific layoffs by ET, an Amazon India spokesperson referred to Galetti’s global announcement. In a blog post to employees, Galetti said the cuts aim to reduce bureaucracy, remove organizational layers, and redirect resources toward the company’s “biggest bets.”The restructuring follows CEO Andy Jassy’s June 2025 warning that AI would shrink Amazon’s workforce in coming years. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” Jassy wrote to employees, describing agentic AI as transformative technology that “should change the way our work is done.”Amazon has ramped up AI investments significantly, pouring more than $100 billion into the technology this year compared to $83 billion in 2024. While the company plans continued hiring in AI-related functions, it expects overall workforce reductions as automation handles more tasks previously done by humans.The company employs approximately 1.55 million people globally as of June 30, including roughly 350,000 in corporate roles. This marks Amazon’s second major round of layoffs in recent years, following the elimination of 27,000 positions between late 2022 and early 2023.Most affected employees will receive 90 days to seek internal positions, with recruiting teams prioritizing internal candidates. Those unable to secure new roles within Amazon will receive severance packages, outplacement services, and continued health insurance benefits.Despite strong business performance, Galetti emphasized that rapid technological change necessitates leaner organizational structures to maintain competitive speed and innovation in an AI-transformed landscape.","Amazon is preparing to eliminate 800 to 1,000 positions in India as part of a sweeping global restructuring driven by artificial intelligence adoption.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.
