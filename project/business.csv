Sonam Wangchuk's Wife Blasts Modi Govt & CRPF Over 6Th Schedule, Dismisses FCRA, Pak Link Charges

NEW DELHI: Gitanjali Angmo, wife of climate activist Sonam Wangchuk , moved the Supreme Court on Friday seeking his release.This comes two days after she reached out to President Droupadi Murmu on Wednesday to seek her intervention for the release of the climate activist, who has been lodged in Jodhpur jail in Rajasthan since being taken into custody following the September 24 violent clashes in Ladakh.In a three-page letter addressed to the President Murmu, Angmo alleged ""witch-hunt"" against her husband for espousing the cause of the people over the past four years and said she is completely unaware about her husband's condition.Wangchuk was detained under National Security Act (NSA) on September 26, two days after violent clashes in Leh town left four persons dead and scores of others injured.The violence broke out during the protests in support of the demands, including statehood for Ladakh and the the region's inclusion in Sixth Schedule of the Constitution.Gitanjali J Angmo, who is also the CEO of Himalayan Institute of Alternatives (HAIL), on Thursday also slammed the Centre and alleged police torture against the people of Ladakh after the September 24 violence in the Union Territory.Comparing the current situation in Ladakh to that during British India, she said that the Union Home Ministry is ""misusing"" the Ladakh Police.""Is India really free? In 1857, 24,000 Britishers used 135,000 Indian sepoys to oppress 300 million Indians under orders from the Queen.

Defence Minister Rajnath Singh Reveals How India Thwarted Pakistan’s Attempt During Op Sindoor

Our fight against terror continues: Min

NEW DELHI: Warning Pakistan about its recent military infrastructure build-up near the sensitive Sir Creek region, defence minister Rajnath Singh Thursday said this shows its “true intentions”. Any misadventure by the neighbour would result in a response “so strong it will change both history and geography” of the area, he warned.“In 1965 (war), Indian Army showed courage by reaching Lahore. In 2025, Pakistan must remember that the road to Karachi also passes through the Creek,” Singh said after performing shastra (arms) puja at Bhuj military station in Gujarat.The marshlands of Sir Creek, a 96-km-long tidal estuary between Rann of Kutch and Pakistan’s Sindh, have been a bone of contention between the neighbours due to differing interpretations of the maritime boundary in the region. The long-standing dispute has implications for access to fishing rights and potential natural resources like oil and gas in the region and affects drawing of maritime boundaries and EEZs in Arabian Sea.Talking about the intense cross-border hostilities under Operation Sindoor from May 7 to 10, Rajnath said Pakistan made failed attempts to penetrate India’s defences along the LoCand International Border stretching from Leh to the Sir Creek region by launching multiple waves of drones and some missiles.The Indian response “exposed the weaknesses of Pakistan’s air defence”, Rajnath said. Despite its superior capability, India showed restraint because its military action was targeted against terrorism and its training hubs.“The objective of Operation Sindoor was not to escalate and start a war. I am happy that the Indian armed forces successfully achieved all the military objectives of Operation Sindoor.However, our fight against terrorismcontinues,” he said.","Rajnath Singh warns Pakistan about its recent military infrastructure build-up near the sensitive Sir Creek region.

NEW DELHI: Trading company Wintrack Inc has levelled serious allegations of corruption and harassment against customs officials in Chennai and announced that it is halting exports and imports from the country, prompting the revenue department to initiate a probe by a senior official.In an eight-minute video posted on X on Thursday, the company’s CEO, Prawin Ganeshan, who described himself as a first-generation entrepreneur sourcing goods from China, has enumerated a series of events starting in Jan, when he first raised a red flag over a bribery demand of Rs 8 lakh from customs officials for a $1,300 package. He alleged an official from Delhi faceless assessment unit had made the demand, but the issue was resolved after he raised it on X. The posts were deleted subsequently, he said.Then in May, when three of his consignments were held up, he paid a bribe of Rs 3 lakh to two units, though not to those working in the “shed”, he alleged. Despite paying the bribe his goods were released after three weeks, he added. Things deteriorated from June when officials in the “shed” refused to clear goods and demanded a bribe of Rs 1.5 lakh, citing payments made to other departments.Since then, Ganeshan alleged, the officials had been raising issues and lodging complaints with seniors.He then floated a company in his wife’s name, and the first consignment was cleared. “When the second shipment came, the officer in the shed refused to examine the shipment and it is still pending,” Ganeshan said in the video and accused a deputy commissioner in the “shed” of threatening his company representatives. “I heard that they are planning revenge, planning to raid and affect my personal life,” he said.The video was posted a day after Chennai Customs, on its official X handle, described the earlier allegations as false. While taking note of the Chennai Customs’ response, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs stepped in, promising necessary action. The finance ministry said a detailed investigation by a senior revenue department official had been ordered.","Trading company Wintrack Inc has levelled serious allegations of corruption and harassment against customs officials in Chennai.

Taliban minister's visit will help explore new areas of cooperation

NEW DELHI: The stunning turnaround in India’s ties with Taliban in the past few years on the back of its humanitarian aid for the people of Afghanistan is set to intensify further with a likely visit by acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi to India on Oct 9-10.He is expected to meet external affairs minister S Jaishankar on the second day of the first trip to India by a senior Taliban official since the group took over the reins of Afghanistan in 2021.New Delhi had been in touch with Kabul since Aug for Muttaqi’s visit. As he faces a UNSC travel ban, India approached the Council for a waiver. It’s understood the request has now been granted, allowing the Centre to finalise the dates.The unprecedented visit by the senior Taliban minister will cap a landmark year in India’s ties with Taliban that saw India shedding inhibitions of the past to upgrade its engagements with the regime in Kabul, despite not recognising it officially.This was done through a meeting between foreign minister Muttaqi and foreign secretary Vikram Misri in Dubai in Jan and the first political contact in the form of a phone call between Jaishankar and the Afghan minister in May.Backing India’s decision to host a Taliban minister, the Taliban head of political office and Afghan ambassador to Qatar, Suhail Shaheen, told TOI last month high-level visits are required to upgrade and strengthen ties. Shaheen had also said the visit will pave the way for exploring various fields of cooperation.In their meeting in Dubai, Misri assured Muttaqi India would consider engaging in development projects soon, in addition to continuing its ongoing humanitarian assistance programme.",Acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi set to visit India on Oct 9-10.

India-China cooperation Will Make The 21st Century a Genuine Asian Century: Chinese Envoy Xu Feihong

NEW DELHI: In the middle of Dussehra festivities, India Thursday announced resumption of direct air services with China from late Oct, marking another significant step in efforts to normalise the relationship that saw PM Narendra Modi visiting Tianjin last month for the SCO summit and also having a bilateral meeting with President Xi Jinping.This is the second major step taken by India to facilitate regular exchanges between the two countries, after govt resumed tourist visas for Chinese nationals.Govt said in a statement that the agreement between civil aviation authorities would further ease people-to-people contact between India and China, contributing towards gradual normalisation of bilateral exchanges, and economic cooperation.Direct flights remained suspended since early 2020, initially because of the pandemic and later because of military and political tensions. India’s efforts to normalise the relationship have acquired a greater sense of urgency because of its recent experience with the Trump administration. Both countries had agreed in principle to resume air services in Jan during foreign secretary Vikram Misri’s visit. Since then, said MEA, civil aviation authorities had been engaged in technical-level discussions on resuming direct air services and on a revised Air Services Agreement.Shortly after MEA’s announcement, IndiGo said it would start a daily nonstop between Kolkata and Guangzhou from Oct 26. The airline will fly between Delhi and Guangzhou, the date for which will be announced shortly. Air India is likely to resume China flights with a nonstop between Delhi and Shanghai by the year-end, say sources.IndiGo said its “familiarity with local partners” enabled it to resume these flights swiftly. IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers said: “This will once again allow seamless movement of people, goods, and ideas, while also strengthening bilateral ties between two of the world’s most populous countries and fast-growing economies...” The flights between Kolkata and Guangzhou will open for sale from Friday.","Direct flights remained suspended since early 2020, initially because of the pandemic and later because of military and political tensions.

NIRF to begin negative marking for dishonesty,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nirf-to-begin-negative-marking-for-dishonesty/articleshow/124278793.cms,"Representative image

MUMBAI: Centre is rewriting the rulebook for India’s National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF), in what could be the sharpest overhaul of the country’s higher education rankings since their inception in 2015. For the first time, penalties are being formally stitched into the ranking methodology, signalling a tougher stance on research malpractice and misrepresentation of data. The negative marking system will soon be declared.This year, the framework docked some marks from an institute’s overall score if published papers were retracted by academic journals. From the coming year, though, the consequences will be deeper and wider. Not only will universities be penalised for retracted work, but even citations of such tainted papers will draw heavy deductions in the research score — effectively broadening the circle of accountability.The change is aimed at curbing what officials describe as a “weakness” in India’s research ecosystem. Papers withdrawn for plagiarism, duplication or manipulated data often continue to be cited, giving them a false academic afterlife.“Retractions damage the credibility of the system.And when retracted papers are cited, they really hold no meaning. And hence, such instances need to be doubly punished with harsher negative marks,” said professor Anil Sahasrabudhe, chairman of the ranking committee. By extending penalties to citations, he explained, govt is signalling zero tolerance towards dishonesty in academic output.The revised rules will also push institutions to institute stronger internal checks. Universities that persistently accumulate lapses may face the ultimate penalty — being struck off the rankings altogether. “While the final decision to debar institutes that continue to deliberately misrepresent has not yet been taken, the committee is serious about such cases and is likely to consider harsh measures,” added Sahasrabudhe.“Rankings are signals to students, employers, investors of faith in an institution. To be rubbed off the table would mean more than a bruise to reputation; it may mean a shut door to opportunity,” said an official.NIRF evaluates institutions across five broad parameters: teaching and learning, graduation outcomes, research, outreach and perception. With over 8,700 institutions participating in the 2024 cycle, its results have become a widely referenced barometer for students, recruiters and policymakers.Experts point out the higher education sector is at a crossroads: on the one hand, the country seeks a larger global footprint in research and innovation, and on the other, it must work to weed out malpractice that risks damaging credibility. Sharper rules, they argue, are a warning and an opportunity. Universities need to invest in ethics training, plagiarism detection systems & transparent review mechanisms, lest a single tainted citation pull down their standing, said Sahasrabudhe.","For the first time, penalties are being formally stitched into the ranking methodology.

Money trail traced to cities

NEW DELHI: ED has launched a massive nationwide drive against cybercrimes through its offices in more than 28 cities. It has identified proceeds of crime (PoC) worth over Rs 28,000 crore and attached assets of more than Rs 8,500 crore in ongoing investigations.Sources said all zonal offices have been roped in to investigate cybercrime cases where state police or other agencies have already registered FIRs for scheduled offences under PMLA. The special task force and two headquarters investigation units (HIUs) in Delhi have also been tasked with probing high-value cases. So far, ED has arrested at least 106 accused persons and suspects.A two-day coordination meeting in Srinagar last month, chaired by ED director Rahul Navin, reviewed the spread of cybercrime and its impact on vulnerable sections of society. A study presented at the meeting revealed how masterminds of scams and ponzi schemes operate from abroad, siphoning funds through hawala or crypto channels. Involvement of online payment gateways is also under probe.The paper highlighted major cases: Raipur zonal office is probing the country’s largest cybercrime case against illegal betting platforms with PoC of Rs 8,000 crore; Mumbai offices are handling cases worth Rs 6,000 crore; the two Delhi HIUs, Rs 5,300 crore; and Hyderabad, Rs 2,600 crore.In the Mahadev Online Betting App case, ED traced laundering of over Rs 8,000 crore. More than 160 searches yielded Rs 19 crore in cash, valuables worth Rs 17 crore, and freezing of bank/DEMAT accounts holding Rs 2,311 crore. Thirteen arrests have been made, and extradition of the masterminds from the UAE is being pursued.The app allegedly enabled illegal betting on cricket, card games and even elections."," ED has identified proceeds of crime (PoC) worth over Rs 28,000 crore.

""This will provide employment to millions of people and bring light into their lives...when we adopt the vow of swadeshi, we also align ourselves with the ambitious campaign to take India to the top position in the world by 2047,"" he stated.

""That marked the beginning of the movement to revive khadi. Khadi has once again become an item of common use among people,"" he said.Shah mentioned how the prime minister, through his 'Mann Ki Baat' program, has been promoting the idea of Swadeshi, inspiring the people of the country to connect with economic development and the ' Make in India ' campaign.

NEW DELHI: India and China are set to resume direct passenger flights by the end of October 2025, the ministry of external affairs said on Thursday, marking a significant step towards restoring normalcy in bilateral ties.In a press release, the MEA said both sides have been holding technical-level discussions since earlier this year on restarting direct air services and revising the Air Services Agreement.""Following these discussions, it has now been agreed that direct air services connecting designated points in India and China can resume by late October 2025, in keeping with the winter season schedule, subject to commercial decision of the designated carriers from the two countries and fulfilment of all operational criteria,"" the press release added.MEA added that the move is expected to expand people-to-people contact between the two neighbours.""This agreement of the civil aviation authorities will further facilitate people-to-people contact between India and China, contributing towards the gradual normalisation of bilateral exchanges,"" it said.IndiGo announced the resumption of its service to Mainland China following the recent diplomatic initiatives.It will resume its flight services connecting Kolkata to Guangzhou (CAN) with daily, non-stop flights starting October 26, according to the official statement.""Subject to regulatory approvals, IndiGo will also introduce direct flights between Delhi and Guangzhou shortly.

6 children dead in MP





NEW DELHI: A senior doctor in Rajasthan who drank a cough syrup to reassure anxious parents later collapsed unconscious, as the medicine has been linked to the deaths of at least two children and several others falling ill in the state.Dr Tarachand Yogi, in charge of the Bayana community health centre, consumed a dose of the syrup on 24 September in front of worried families.Eight hours later, he was found unconscious in his car, raising alarm over the safety of the widely distributed medicine.The Rajasthan government has since banned 22 batches of the syrup, recalled existing stock and launched an inquiry.Over 1.33 lakh bottles of the syrup were distributed in the state since July, officials said, with 8,200 still in storage at Jaipur’s Sawai Man Singh Hospital, news agency PTI reported.Concerns mounted after a five-year-old boy from Sikar district died on Monday, hours after being given the syrup prescribed at a community health centre.His death followed an earlier case on 22 September in Bharatpur, where two-year-old Samrat Jatav died after consuming the same medicine.“Three of my grandchildren took the syrup. Two eventually woke up after vomiting, but Samrat never regained consciousness.We only realised later that the medicine was the cause,” the child’s grandmother Nehni Jatav told reporters.Doctors confirmed that eight other children between the ages of one and five fell ill in Banswara district last week after consuming the syrup.Drug Controller Ajay Phatak said inspectors had collected samples from Sikar, Jhunjhunu and Bharatpur. “The syrup should not be administered to children below five years of age. Test results are expected within three days,” he told reporters.Authorities said the syrup was supplied by Kayson Pharma, whose deliveries have now been halted.Doctors across Rajasthan have been instructed to stop prescribing the drug immediately.Six children in Madhya Pradesh’s Chhindwara district have died from kidney-related complications between September 4 and September 26, prompting authorities to investigate the cause.The children initially exhibited common symptoms such as colds, coughs, and fever before their conditions worsened.Health officials reported that cases emerged from the Parasia area starting August 22.Three of the children had been admitted to a private hospital in Chhindwara and later transferred to Nagpur, where they died between September 4 and 7.The remaining three deaths occurred later, bringing the total to six.In response, authorities established a dedicated 10-bed ward at Parasia government hospital. Samples from patients, water, and other sources were collected by teams from the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and the state Integrated Disease Surveillance Project (IDSP) for laboratory testing, though most results are still pending.Preliminary human sample reports have not revealed any serious issues.Similar cases have also been reported in Betul, Seoni, and Pandhurna districts.Authorities have temporarily banned certain medicines, including cough syrups found in the homes of the deceased children, until lab results are available.Five affected children are currently receiving treatment at Government Medical College, Nagpur.","Dr Tarachand Yogi, in charge of the Bayana community health centre, consumed a dose of the syrup on 24 September in front of worried families.

Accenture: Building an AI workforce







Accenture has reportedly laid off thousands of employees across the globe in the past three months. During earnings call, the company said that it is laying off employees that cannot be trained in AI, as Accenture looks to reshape its workforce for the AI era. It further added that it plans to expand headcount in the coming fiscal year.During the earnings call Accenture CEO Julie Sweet said that the company has been ""exiting"" employees it can't retrain with artificial intelligence skills. “We are exiting on a compressed timeline, people where reskilling, based on our experience, is not a viable path for the skills we need. And, we're continuously identifying areas of how we operate Accenture to drive more efficiencies, including through AI in order to create more investment capacity,” Accenture CEO said.At the end of August, Accenture’s global headcount stood at 779,000, down from 791,000 three months earlier. ""In FY26, we expect to increase our headcount overall across our three markets, including in the US and Europe, reflecting the demand we see in our business,"" said Julie Sweet. The restructuring at the company majorly covers severance costs and is said to save more than $1 billion for the company. Accenture CFO Angie Park said that the company will also divest two acquisitions as part of what the company calls “rapid talent rotation.""Before I move on to the details of the quarter, I want to spend a moment on the six-month business optimization program we initiated in Q4, for which we recorded a charge of $615 million and expect to record an additional approximately $250 million in Q1, for a total of approximately $865 million over the period. The business optimization program has two parts. One related to rapid talent rotation that Julie mentioned, which reflects severance associated with headcount reductions that we are making in a compressed timeline, and second, related to the divestiture of two acquisitions that are no longer aligned with our strategic priorities. These actions will result in cost-savings, which will be reinvested in our people and our business,"" he said.While trimming roles that don’t align with its future needs, Accenture is said to be aggressively expanding its AI capabilities. The company has revealed that it has doubled down on its AI and data specialists to 77,000 since 2023 and has also trained more than 550,000 employees in generative AI. “Advanced AI is becoming a part of everything we do,” Sweet said, adding that the company views AI not as “deflationary” but “expansionary. ”Despite the layoffs, Accenture reported a 7% year‑on‑year revenue increase to $17.6 billion in the June–August quarter of fiscal 2025, beating estimates. Sweet said the results demonstrate Accenture’s “unique ability to deliver for clients as they seek our help to reinvent and lead with AI.”It is quite clear that Accenture’s restructuring mirrors the trend across companies. Tech giants like Meta, Microsoft and others have also cut down on traditional job roles along with ramping the AI hiring process. For white-collar professionals, the message is clear: adapt to AI or risk obsolescence.","Accenture has reportedly laid off thousands of employees across the globe in the past three months.

There are questions about where Zoho is developed and where the data is hosted and who hosts it. There is a lot of false information we want to correct.

Poll Should companies clarify the data storage and hosting practices to the public? Yes, it's critical. No, it's not necessary.

1. All the products are developed in India. Our

global headquarters

is in Chennai and we pay taxes in India on our global income. As a global corporation headquartered in India, we have offices in over 80 countries and have a strong presence in the US which is a big market for us.

2. Indian customer data is hosted in India (Mumbai, Delhi and Chennai, soon Odissa). We have over 18 data centers globally and they host the respective country or regional data. We are committed to hosting each country data in their own jurisdiction.

3. All our services run on hardware we own and software frameworks we developed, on top of open source like

Linux

OS and Postgres database.

4. We do not host our products on AWS or Azure. Arattai, specifically, is not hosted on AWS or Azure or GCloud. We use some of those services for regional switching nodes to speed up traffic but data is not stored in them. We are adding many such ""points of presence"" (POPs) as we speak.

5. Our Zoho Developer account in the App Store and Play Store lists our US office address because the account was registered in the very early days of those stores by one of our employees in the US just to test them out. We never changed that.

We are proudly ""Made in India, Made for the World"" and we mean it.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has once again made an urgent appeal to Washington, arguing that allowing American technology companies to compete openly in China serves the best interests of both the countries. On the tech podcast BG2, a podcast hosted by tech investors Brad Gerstner and Bill Gurley, Huang emphasized that a competitive presence in China would enable the US to ""proliferate the technology around the world"" and ""maximise America’s economic success and geopolitical influence.""Huang also expressed hope that China would remain open to outside investment, noting Beijing's pledges to maintain an ""open market."" ""What’s in the best interest of China is for foreign companies to invest in China, compete in China and for them to also have vibrant competition themselves,"" he said.Huang highlighted the rapid advances and robust potential of China's chipmaking industry, cautioning that the country is ""nanoseconds behind"" the US. ""We’ve got to go compete,"" he asserted, pointing to China's deep talent pool, hustling work culture, and intense internal competition across its provinces.He described the environment as a ""vibrant, entrepreneurial, hi-tech, modern industry.""Nvidia's Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are the essential backbone for training and running artificial intelligence (AI) models, a factor that has propelled the company's market capitalization to record highs. However, this success has been complicated by escalating geopolitical tensions, which have severely disrupted sales in China, one of the world's largest markets.Earlier this year, the US temporarily blocked exports of the H20, a downgraded chip designed to comply with restrictions, before relenting after a 15% levy to the US government was agreed upon. In August, the White House announced that President Donald Trump and Huang had struck a deal under which Nvidia would receive export licenses in exchange for 15% of Chinese sales of the H20 going to the US government.In a related news, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang welcomed President Donald Trump's overhaul of the H-1B visa program but warned that the new $100,000 application fee may be prohibitively expensive, potentially driving tech investment and talent away from the United States.","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says U.S. companies should be able to compete openly in China.

But this momentum is unlikely to sustain in the context of the sustained FII selling in the market. FIIs are likely to further accelerate selling since the market construct provides them the opportunity to sell aggressively. The huge short position in the market indicates that the bulls will be on the defensive. Aggressive DII buying can provide some support to the market particularly in largecap auto stocks, which have strong fundamental support now.”“The central bank initiatives to accelerate credit flow into the economy will be positive for banks. The stronger banks will gain not only from higher credit growth but also from lower premium for deposit insurance. The fairly valued largecap banks are attractive buys from a medium to long-term perspective. Auto stocks will continue to be resilient backed by positive news of large orders and sharp increase in sales.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

The UAE’s ambitious 900-kilometre Etihad Rail project has taken a major step forward with the unveiling of a detailed network map during the Global Rail conference in Abu Dhabi. While the full station list remains under wraps, key elements have been disclosed—offering a glimpse into what will be the country’s first national passenger rail service. With scenic routes across deserts and mountains, top-tier amenities, and smart connectivity, Etihad Rail promises a transformative commuting experience once launched in 2026.Etihad Rail’s passenger network will span 900 km across the UAE, weaving through dramatic natural landscapes and key urban centres. The updated map, presented at the Global Rail conference in Abu Dhabi, confirmed that the route will connect major cities via passenger stations, freight terminals, and operational depots.While the complete station list has not yet been officially disclosed, four initial stations have been confirmed: Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, and Fujairah. Construction is actively underway at these locations, with test trains already observed on sections of the track over the past year.In addition to these primary hubs, several potential station locations were also highlighted on the exhibition map. These include:The route is expected to offer passengers breathtaking views across some of the UAE’s most iconic terrains, including the golden dunes of Abu Dhabi, the Al Maha Forest, and the rugged Hajar Mountains in Fujairah.“It was a very proud moment riding the train in the UAE,” said Azza Al Suwaidi, Deputy CEO of Etihad Rail Mobility, in a quote to. “There’s a lot of nice scenery of the dunes and the desert. Also, when you go to Fujairah, there is a path that runs through the Hajar Mountains. So, it’s a very lovely experience.”Once operational, Etihad Rail aims to deliver time-efficient alternatives to road travel. Journey durations between major cities have already been shared:These journey times highlight how Etihad Rail is set to transform not just travel within the UAE, but also how the country connects with its neighbours. A major part of that vision is the Hafeet Rail, also known as the UAE-Oman Rail, a 238-kilometre cross-border link that will connect Sohar Port in Oman to Abu Dhabi. Announced in May 2024, the project is already well underway, with construction nearing the halfway mark, reportedly 50 to 70 per cent complete. Once operational, it will significantly boost both passenger and freight movement between the two countries.Trains on this route, as well as across the wider Etihad Rail network, are designed to travel at comfortable cruising speeds of up to 200 km/h, delivering a balance of speed, comfort, and panoramic views along the way.Designed by CAF (Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles), a Spanish rolling stock manufacturer, Etihad Rail’s passenger trains are built to meet stringent European standards. The trains will accommodate over 400 passengers, distributed across three travel classes: First Class, Business Class, and Economy.Each class is designed to cater to specific traveler needs:Amenities onboard will include:Etihad Rail has also partnered with Italian luxury hospitality brand Arsenale to lead the development of a luxury train experience, inspired by the elegance of the Orient Express. Though prototype videos of the interiors have been teased online, officials stress that final configurations may still change before the official launch.Also read: First glimpse of 200 km/h Etihad Rail passenger trains unveiled Each station along the Etihad Rail network is being designed to provide a seamless, pleasant pre-boarding experience. Planned features include:As for ticketing, pricing has not yet been announced. However, it was confirmed in February 2024 that Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) is the official ticketing and fare payment partner. This opens the possibility of using Dubai’s Nol card as a mode of payment for Etihad Rail journeys.Established in 2009, Etihad Rail initially focused on freight operations. The freight network was anounced as fully operational in 2023, with 38 locomotives and over 1,000 wagons already transporting various goods across the country. These operations are helping reduce heavy truck traffic on UAE roads and increasing logistical efficiency.Now, with the passenger network on the horizon, the focus has shifted to delivering a sustainable, well-connected public transport system that supports the UAE’s wider infrastructure ambitions. Etihad Rail is being developed to integrate smoothly with each city’s metro lines, feeder buses , and local transit networks, ensuring comprehensive last-mile connectivity and a unified travel experience across the country.The passenger rail service is set to launch in 2026, and will eventually connect 11 cities and regions, including:However, Etihad Rail officials have clarified that not all stations may be available on day one, and the exact rollout schedule remains under wraps.","Etihad Rail’s passenger network will span 900 km across the UAE, weaving through dramatic natural landscapes and key urban centres.

NEW DELHI: Delhi environment department will conduct a study on ""smog-eating"" photocatalytic coatings which, when applied to roads, concrete and tiles, reduce nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) and harmful hydrocarbons in the air.These coatings utilise a photocatalyst, predominantly titanium dioxide (TiO₂), which breaks down pollutants, mainly nitrogen oxides (NOx) and some volatile organic compounds (VOCs), when exposed to sunlight.The method has been piloted or implemented in small stretches in the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Denmark, Mexico, China and the US.Pavements with coatings of titanium dioxide exist in some stretches of a few cities in the US.Studies, however, have questioned the longevity of this way of reducing emissions that are harmful to humans. Some studies say that photocatalytic coatings work best as a supplementary measure alongside reducing emissions from vehicles, traffic management, and the creation of sustainable infrastructure.Delhi environment minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa on Sept 21 said the department will lead this work in simple, accountable steps: selecting a reputed scienti-fic partner within 30 days, running field trials on city stretches, sharing monthly progress, and delivering a final report within six mont-hs of the MoU.The study will focus on safety, sustainability and value for money, while mapping credible suppliers so Delhi can scale fast if the results are strong, he said.A study titled 'Photocatalytic-treated asphalt road in Copenhagen for urban NO₂ removal' evaluated the effect of urban air quality improvement after the application of photocatalytic asphalt granulates in an urban background site along Roskildevej the Frederiksberg municipality of Copenhagen, Denmark. The study found that the observed annual mean NO₂ concentration during the study period complied with the air quality standard there.Some studies, however, said that local conditions significantly reduce the effectiveness of such coatings due to variable wind conditions, traffic density, deposition of dust, shading or cloudiness and humidity. A few studies also highlighted that the efficacy of photocatalytic coating declines with time.""If the study confirms that these smog-eating surfaces are effective and cost-efficient, the department will move a cabinet proposal for rapid, citywide deployment at priority locations such as busy corridors, markets and public spaces,"" Sirsa said.He added Delhi will evaluate and adopt the best of proven photocatalytic technologies, prioritising safety, sustainability, and measurable impact to deliver cleaner air faster.","Delhi environment department will conduct a study on ""smog-eating"" photocatalytic coatings.

Understanding how UAE fuel prices are set

Tips to save on fuel in 2025





The UAE Fuel Price Committee has announced the fuel prices for October 2025, reflecting a slight increase across all fuel types compared to September. These adjustments align with global oil market trends and are part of the UAE's monthly review process to keep domestic fuel prices in line with international rates.These price changes are determined based on the average global price of oil and are applicable across all Emirates, including Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, and others. The UAE's approach to fuel pricing ensures that residents and businesses experience consistent and transparent fuel costs. For people commuting daily to work, school, or errands, the small price hike may feel noticeable at the pump. Middle-class and lower-income residents can manage costs by:The recent increase in UAE fuel prices for October 2025 is closely linked to trends in the global oil market, which plays a major role in determining local fuel costs. Factors such as international supply and demand, geopolitical tensions in oil-producing regions, and fluctuations in crude oil prices all have a direct impact on the rates residents pay at the pump. For example, disruptions in major oil-exporting countries or unexpected changes in production can quickly drive up global prices, which then filter down to domestic markets. Additionally, seasonal demand spikes, such as increased travel during holidays, can also influence pricing.By understanding these global dynamics, everyday commuters and middle-class families can better anticipate changes and plan their monthly fuel budgets more effectively, rather than being caught off guard by sudden hikes.Fuel pricing in the UAE follows a deregulated model introduced in August 2015, which links local petrol and diesel rates to international oil prices. This policy ensures transparency and aligns retail prices with global market conditions. Each month, the UAE Fuel Price Committee reviews global trends and announces new rates, typically during the final days of the month. These rates take effect from the 1st day of the following month.This approach means UAE motorists feel the impact of both upswings and drops in the international energy market, encouraging more efficient fuel usage while maintaining pricing fairness.Looking to keep more dirhams in your pocket while filling up? Think of it as fuel-saving hacks for everyday heroes. First, carpooling like a boss sharing rides with friends or colleagues not only saves cash but also gives you some gossip time on the road. Next, combine your errands; that extra trip to the supermarket? Toss it in with the school run. Drive like a Zen master gentle acceleration, smooth braking, and no sudden sprints can stretch every litre farther. Don’t forget your car needs TLC too; proper tire pressure and timely servicing mean your engine sips fuel, not gulps it. And if you really want to be clever, fill up during off-peak hours, so you avoid long queues and unnecessary idling. A little planning and some smart moves can turn fuel anxiety into a monthly money-saving win.While the October 2025 fuel price adjustments represent a modest increase, they underscore the UAE's commitment to aligning domestic fuel prices with global market conditions. Staying informed about these changes allows consumers and businesses to plan and adapt accordingly.","The UAE Fuel Price Committee has announced the fuel prices for October 2025, reflecting a slight increase across all fuel types compared to September.

Thinking of inviting your parents, siblings, or even a friend, to visit you in the UAE? You’ll now need to show what’s in your paycheck. The country has introduced new income rules for sponsoring visitors, with different salary slabs depending on who you’re inviting. It’s part of a bigger shake-up to the UAE’s visa system, which now includes new categories, special permits, and updated rules for families, professionals, and humanitarian cases.Inviting someone to the UAE on a visit visa now depends not just on who they are, but also on how much you earn. As part of sweeping updates to its visa system, the UAE’s Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security (ICP) has introduced income-based eligibility rules for residents sponsoring friends and family.According to the ICP, the updated policy lays out three distinct salary thresholds:These new requirements are part of a broader set of regulatory updates introduced by the ICP. The income-based criteria are intended to ensure financial responsibility on the part of the sponsor and to streamline the process in a way that supports transparency and sustainable immigration management.According to the ICP, the changes were introduced following extensive studies that examined present and future trends in residency and international mobility.The analysis also incorporated feedback from customers, stakeholders, and frontline service centers. These insights were gathered via mechanisms such as customer councils, call centers, and the authority’s complaints and inquiry platforms.Once the visit visa is approved, visitors, whether family or friends, can generally stay in the UAE for 30 to 90 days, depending on the visa type issued. Some of these visas also come with the option to extend the stay, usually in two stages:These extensions are not automatic and are subject to approval and additional fees.If you're planning to sponsor a friend or relative, make sure all the required documents and conditions are in place before applying. The process is straightforward, but attention to detail matters. Here’s what’s expected:If you’re sponsoring a relative, you’ll need to submit proof of kinship and a valid justification for the visit. For instance, if you're sponsoring a foreign woman whose husband resides in the GCC, you must also attach a copy of his UAE or GCC residence permit.As part of the updated framework, the UAE has launched four new types of visit visas tailored to specific professional and economic sectors:These new categories are intended to attract global talent and enhance the UAE’s visibility as a destination for innovation, leisure, and industry-specific gatherings.Also read: UAE launches 4 new special Visit Visas for AI, cruise, events, and entertainment Beyond the visit visa updates, the ICP has introduced sweeping changes to residency rules, aimed at offering more flexibility across humanitarian, family, and professional circumstances. Here’s a summary of key developments:A one-year renewable residency permit can now be issued to foreigners from countries experiencing war, disasters, or unrest. Notably, this permit does not require a guarantor or host. Its issuance or cancellation will be based on reports by the General Directorate of Identity and Foreigners Affairs.Importantly, the Director General of Identity and Foreigners Affairs has the authority to waive standard requirements like financial solvency or kinship degree in special humanitarian cases involving relatives or in-laws. This aims to ensure compassionate handling of vulnerable individuals.Two categories of women are now eligible for a renewable one-year residence permit:All applicants must demonstrate financial capability and adequate housing. Custody disputes will be settled by a designated legal committee.Applicants must now either prove strong financial solvency related to their planned business, or clearly demonstrate they are already actively engaged in a similar business either abroad or through a registered UAE-based entity.Regulations for truck drivers have been streamlined. These visas can be single or multiple-entry and must be sponsored by licensed freight or logistics companies. Conditions include providing a financial guarantee, valid health insurance, and paying required government fees.","Residents must earn between AED 4,000 and AED 15,000 monthly to sponsor family or friends for UAE visit visas. The country has introduced new income rules for sponsoring visitors with different salary slabs. Four new Visit Visa categories unveiled.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124229714,imgsize-1314480,width-400,resizemode-4/uae-visit-visa.jpg"
'If women can make it': Pete Hegseth calls for 'gender-neutral' fitness rules; signals fewer women in combat roles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/if-women-can-make-it-pete-hegseth-calls-for-gender-neutral-fitness-rules-signals-fewer-women-in-combat-roles/articleshow/124245105.cms,"US defense secretary Pete Hegseth (Pic credit: AP)

Trump’s Most Awkward Speech Yet? Generals Refuse to Clap, Silence Fills the Room | WATCH





US defense secretary Pete Hegseth on Tuesday announced new directives for the military, including implementing gender-neutral physical fitness standards and eliminating what he described as ""woke"" culture from the armed forces. The announcement came during an in-person meeting with military officials at the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia.The new policies are guided by what Hegseth calls the “1990 test,” which examines whether changes to military standards since 1990 were necessary due to evolving combat needs or were influenced by other priorities. “The 1990s test is simple. What were the military standards in 1990, and if they have changed, tell me why: Was it a necessary change based on the evolving landscape of combat, or was the change due to a softening, weakening or gender-based pursuit of other priorities?” he explained.“I don’t want my son serving alongside troops who are out of shape, or in a combat unit with females who can’t meet the same Combat Arms physical standards as men, or troops who are not fully proficient on their assigned weapons, platform, or task, or under a leader who was the first but not the best. Standards must be uniform, gender neutral and high,” Hegseth said.Women were first allowed in direct combat roles during the Obama administration.While Hegseth did not announce a full rollback of women in combat, he made it clear that the “highest male standards” would now apply to all combat roles. He acknowledged that this could result in fewer women qualifying for some positions.“We very much value the impact of female troops — our female officers and NCOs are the absolute best in the world. But when it comes to any job that requires physical power to perform in combat, those physical standards must be high and gender-neutral,” he said. “If women can make it, excellent. If not, it is what it is. If that means no women qualify for some combat jobs, so be it. That is not the intent, but it could be the result. ”Under the new rules, all combat personnel, including generals and admirals, will be required to pass two yearly physical tests. Hegseth emphasized that the standards are “gender neutral” but will be based on the “highest male standard” for physical fitness in combat roles.","US defense secretary Pete Hegseth on Tuesday announced new directives for the military.

'My family traces to Pakistan': LaWhore Vagistan's old interview viral as Harvard hires drag queen as visiting professor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/my-family-traces-to-pakistan-lawhore-vagistans-old-interview-viral-as-harvard-hires-drag-queen-as-visiting-professor/articleshow/124278731.cms,"Kareem Khubchandani, a drag queen who goes by the name LaWhore Vagistan, is now a visiting professor at Harvard.

Who is Kareem Khubchandani ?







Harvard University became the butt of all social media banter as it welcomed Kareem Khubchandani as the visiting professor to teach the Studies of Gender and Sexuality program in Harvard. Kareem's stage name, 'LaWhore Vagistan', threw social media into disbelief and the right-wingers called out Harvard.The old interview of Kareem, where she described how she chose her name, went viral in the wake of Harvard's announcement. “My name is LaWhore Vagistan, my preferred pronouns are ‘she’ or ‘aunty.’ I chose ‘LaWhore’ because my family traces its origins to Pakistan: Lahore is an important city in Pakistan, and well, I’m a bit of a w*ore,” the drag queen said in 2015.“And Vagistan because I see the subcontinent as one, big, beautiful Vag … istan,” he explained. ""Close your eyes and visualize it: India is the uterus-vagina, Pakistan and Bangladesh are the ovaries, Afghanistan, Nepal, Burma, and Bhutan are the fallopian tubes, and Sri Lanka is a little floating labia,"" she said.Khubchandani will teach just two classes over the course of two semesters — “Queer Ethnography” in the fall and “RuPaulitics: Drag, Race, and Desire” in the spring semester, according to Harvard’s announcement.The latter class will apparently focus on the cable television show “RuPaul’s Drag Race.”Kareem holds a PhD in Performance Studies from Northwestern University, and prior to that an MA in the same field, and a BA in Sociology & Anthropology from Colgate University.

Taliban FM to visit India next week? Muttaqi gets travel exemption; first high-level trip since 2021 takeover,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/taliban-fm-to-visit-india-next-week-muttaqi-gets-travel-exemption-first-high-level-trip-since-2021-takeover/articleshow/124275380.cms,"Amir Khan Muttaqi (File photo)





Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi has been granted a temporary travel exemption to visit India next week. This marks the first high-level visit by a Taliban leader to New Delhi since the group took power in Afghanistan in 2021.According to officials, the UN Security Council sanctions committee has authorised Muttaqi to travel to New Delhi between October 9 and 16.The visit is expected to revive earlier plans that were delayed after sanctions restrictions prevented him from travelling, according to news agency Afghanistan International.Before arriving in India, Muttaqi will attend the seventh round of the “Moscow Format” talks in Russia on October 6 at the invitation of Russian officials. This will be the first time the Taliban participates as a member, rather than a guest in the multilateral forum.Describing the development as an “important step,” Muttaqi said he hoped such platforms would help strengthen trust and improve ties with neighbouring countries.The planned trip to India comes after months of speculation. In August, reports suggested that New Delhi was considering inviting Muttaqi, but government sources had clarified that India would approach the UN for a waiver only once the visit was finalised.Afghan media had then reported that the absence of approval had delayed the plan.India’s engagement with the Taliban has steadily increased in recent years, largely built around humanitarian assistance and developmental aid.External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has twice spoken with Muttaqi, including last week when he conveyed condolences over the recent earthquake in Afghanistan and announced India’s relief assistance.Earlier this year, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri also met Muttaqi in Dubai to discuss Afghanistan’s urgent developmental needs.India has consistently maintained that while it is aligned with the international community on the question of formal recognition of the Taliban regime, it will continue to provide humanitarian aid and support to the Afghan people.New Delhi has delivered large quantities of food, medicines and relief material and has over 500 development projects running across Afghanistan.Taliban officials have also called for stronger ties with India. Suhail Shaheen, head of the Taliban’s political office in Qatar, recently said high-level visits such as Muttaqi’s were essential to explore cooperation in trade and other areas, adding that the Taliban valued India’s assistance and historical friendship with the Afghan people.If the visit goes ahead, it will mark a landmark moment in India-Afghanistan relations, signalling New Delhi’s intention to cautiously deepen engagement with the Taliban regime while balancing global concerns about recognition and sanctions.",Amir Khan Muttaqi has been granted a temporary travel exemption to visit India next week.

Poll Do you believe the Taliban's suspension of internet services is justified? Yes, to prevent immorality No, it's an infringement on rights





The Taliban government in Afghanistan has ordered a nationwide suspension of internet and mobile phone service, following weeks of cutting fibre-optic internet connections in different provinces.According to internet watchdog NetBlocks, the country is experiencing a ""total internet blackout."" The group reported that the disruption appears to be the most extensive and coordinated shutdown of telecom services in Afghanistan since the Taliban regained control in 2021. The blackout has raised concerns about the return of earlier restrictions from the Taliban’s first rule, when they banned television, satellite dishes, and other forms of mass communication in what they described as a campaign against immorality.The government had already started reducing high-speed internet access in some provinces earlier this month. Officials said this was done to prevent ""vice,"" following orders from the Taliban’s supreme leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada.By Monday night, mobile phone signals and internet access steadily weakened across the country until overall connectivity dropped to less than one percent of normal activity, NetBlocks reported.It is the first time since the Taliban seized power in 2021, after years of insurgency, that communication services across the nation have been cut off. Since then, the group has enforced a strict version of Islamic law and imposed several restrictions.Residents expressed concern over the impact of the blackout on daily life and business. ""We are blind without phones and internet,"" Najibullah, a 42-year-old shopkeeper in Kabul, was quoted as saying by the news agency AFP. ""All our business relies on mobiles. The deliveries are with mobiles. It's like a holiday, everyone is at home. The market is totally frozen.""The Taliban have not issued an official explanation for the nationwide suspension. A government official, however, said that “eight to nine thousand telecommunications pillars” would be switched off and added that the blackout would remain in place “until further notice.”Just last year, in 2024, the Taliban had described Afghanistan’s fibre-optic project as a key priority. The 9,350-kilometre (5,800-mile) network, developed mostly during governments backed by the United States, was promoted as a way to connect the country with the outside world and support economic recovery.Earlier in September, Taliban representatives warned that they planned to cut off internet access nationwide “to prevent immoral activities.” They did not specify what was considered immoral under their order.Haji Zaid, the governor of Balkh province, said in a statement that ""an alternative system will be established within the country for essential needs."" He did not clarify what this system would include or how it would function.","The Taliban government in Afghanistan has ordered a nationwide suspension of internet and mobile phone service.

How Indian nationals are snapping up British buy-to-lets,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/how-indian-nationals-are-snapping-up-british-buy-to-lets/articleshow/124261789.cms,"TOI Correspondent from London:





Indian nationals are the largest non-UK shareholders of buy-to-let companies in Britain this year, according to analysis by estate agency Hamptons.Analysis of data by Hamptons shows that Indian investors are followed by Nigerians, Poles and Irish. Indians have made up the largest group since 2023; in 2022, they were the second-largest.In the first half of this year, Indian nationals founded 684 new buy-to-let companies, with more registered in Hillingdon than in any other area. Nigerian investors follow closely with 647 new incorporations. This shift reflects wider post-Brexit migration patterns.Buy-to-let companies are special-purpose companies set up to buy and manage residential rental properties.EU nationals now account for 49% of non-UK shareholders, down from 65% in 2016. There has been a general fall in shareholders from the Anglosphere, too. In 2016, Irish, Americans, South Africans and Australians all featured in the top 10. By 2025, only Irish nationals remained, ranking fourth. Instead, Indian and Nigerian investors are stepping into the spotlight, despite rents falling this year for the first time in five years.There were approximately 127,000 more Nigerian nationals and 178,000 more Indian nationals immigrating to the UK in 2023 compared with 2019, according to the Office of National Statistics.Twenty per cent of buy-to-let companies set up in the UK so far this year are owned by non-UK national shareholders, up from 13% in 2016. The remaining 80% are owned by UK shareholders. Seven per cent of Indian nationals who own UK buy-to-let companies set up over the past decade live in India.At current rates, around 67,000 new companies will be set up by the end of 2025, with around 13,500 owned, at least in part, by non-UK nationals. Companies are a more tax-efficient way of managing rental properties in Britain.Whilst London has always been an attractive investment choice for foreign landlords, between 2016 and 2025 the share of new non-UK national landlords has more than doubled in the East Midlands, West Midlands and Scotland.Aneisha Beveridge, head of research at Hamptons, said: “While overseas-based investors are part of the picture, the majority of purchases by non-UK nationals reflect domestic demand. Up until 2021, this demand was most likely to come from EU nationals based in the UK, but since then it has shifted to reflect changes in broader migration patterns. Indian and Nigerian nationals are increasingly likely to buy UK buy-to-let property in a limited company structure. ”","Analysis of data by Hamptons shows that Indian investors are followed by Nigerians, Poles and Irish.

LONDON: Bodies representing Indian students, UK academics and UK universities have slammed plans by Labour to impose a levy on international students to pay for maintenance grants for domestic students from low-income families at university or college, saying it will put off international students and hit university finances hard.UK education secretary Bridget Phillipson pledged to introduce the new means-tested maintenance grants by the end of this parliament in her speech at the Labour Party conference on Monday.The grants will be fully funded by a new international student levy, the Labour Party confirmed, saying this would “ensure revenue from international students is used to benefit working-class domestic students”.The immigration white paper published in May had proposed a 6% levy on international student fees.INSA UK president Amit Tiwari said a 6% levy risked pricing Indian students out of Britain’s higher education market.In the year ending June 2025 Indian students were the second-largest cohort, after Chinese students, to study in the UK, with 98,014 study visas granted.“Indian students alone contributed over £4 billion to the UK economy last year,” Tiwari said. “Adding a new charge will push them towards Canada, Australia and the US.”Policy consultancy Public First predicts a 6% levy will lead to a loss of 16,100 international students in the first year, leading to a £240 million loss of fee income to the sector, and a loss of 77,000 international students in the first five years, leading to a loss of £2.2 billion.The shortfall of funds could lead to 33,000 fewer places for British students in the first year, and 135,000 fewer places in five years.Vivienne Stern, chief executive of Universities UK, said a levy would mean universities have even less of their scant resources to invest into expanding access.Jonathan Simons, partner at Public First, said: “Around 40% of our universities are currently in deficit; a levy will lead to a further loss of jobs and places for UK students. There is a real danger that the very students govt wishes to help won’t be able to access a course at all because the international students won’t be there to subsidise them.”“Treating international students as cash cows to fund maintenance grants amounts to robbing Peter to pay Paul,” said Jo Grade, general secretary of University and College Union. “This country is already charging international students through the roof.","UK education secretary Bridget Phillipson pledged to introduce the new means- tested maintenance grants by the end of this parliament.

What changed on the ground

Cranbourne Gate, a popular entrance used by local dog walkers and cyclists, has been permanently shut despite residents paying for annual passes to use it.

Gates at Sandpit Gate, Woodend Gate and South Forest have also been closed to the public.

The restrictions are legally enforced under Section 128 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, making entry without permission a criminal offence.

Security measures now include fencing, round-the-clock surveillance, and tree planting to increase privacy.

Voices of frustration

“We have walked our dogs here for 20 years. To be told we cannot anymore feels like a kick in the teeth,” said one resident.

“We pay for the park through passes and maintenance. Now part of it is closed off without much explanation,” another added.

“It is frustrating, but they are high-profile figures. I can understand why their team wants maximum protection.”

Windsor Great Park: history and symbolism

A pattern of royal security clashes

When William and Kate moved to Adelaide Cottage in 2022, additional security measures drew concern from nearby residents.

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s tenure at Frogmore Cottage also led to debates about security funding and access limitations.

Buckingham Palace itself has seen long-running disputes over traffic restrictions, public protests and the balance between safety and visibility.

Why this row matters beyond Windsor

Privacy versus public access

Local impact

Image of the monarchy





Prince William and Kate Middleton are preparing to move into Forest Lodge, a Georgian mansion within Windsor Great Park. The property is intended to serve as their long-term family base. But the decision has provoked anger among locals after a large exclusion zone was imposed around the estate.The restricted area spans about 150 acres and is enclosed by a 2.3-mile perimeter. Access points that residents have used for decades are now closed. Security fences, cameras, tree cover and privacy screens are being set up to prevent outsiders from approaching or viewing the royal property.While royal security is always a sensitive subject, the changes have reignited the long-standing debate in Britain about how much public space should be restricted for the benefit of the monarchy.For many in the Windsor area, the change means longer journeys, blocked walking routes and the loss of familiar open spaces.Locals have expressed deep disappointment at the speed and scale of the restrictions. Many say they were given little notice.At the same time, some community members recognise the security needs of the Prince and Princess of Wales.Officials have responded by stressing that the restricted area represents a very small portion of Windsor Great Park, which stretches across thousands of acres.The dispute matters because Windsor Great Park is not just a green space. The park has been a royal hunting ground, ceremonial site and public space for centuries. It covers more than 5,000 acres and attracts walkers, cyclists and tourists from across the world.Historically, the park was the preserve of monarchs and aristocrats. Over time, large sections were opened to the public. That shift helped reinforce the royal family’s image of accessibility and connection with ordinary citizens. Restrictions on routes and entrances, therefore, can feel like a reversal of that tradition.This is not the first time royal security has clashed with public rights.These examples show the tension between maintaining strong protective boundaries and keeping the royal family connected with the public.High-profile figures require extraordinary security. But the closure of traditional paths inside Windsor Great Park strikes at a larger issue: how much public land should be sacrificed to protect the royals.The changes affect everyday life. Dog walkers have to reroute, cyclists face longer journeys and some residents feel they have lost the value of annual passes.The royals are under pressure to maintain public support in a changing Britain. Moves that look like exclusion can feed a narrative of distance at a time when the family tries to show relatability and modern relevance.William and Kate are expected to move into Forest Lodge later this year. Whether the protests subside or continue will depend on how officials manage local anger. Some campaigners want partial access restored. Others demand compensation for residents who paid for now-useless passes.For the royal couple, the controversy is a reminder that every move they make is scrutinised not just for security, but also for its impact on communities. Windsor Great Park may remain largely open, but the row over Forest Lodge shows that even small areas of exclusion can cause outsized debate in Britain and abroad.","Prince William and Kate Middleton are preparing to move into Forest Lodge, a Georgian mansion within Windsor Great Park.

£5bn Bitcoin scam busted: Chinese national convicted in UK in largest cryptocurrency seizure; pleads guilty,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/5bn-bitcoin-scam-busted-chinese-national-convicted-in-uk-in-largest-cryptocurrency-seizure-pleads-guilty/articleshow/124226701.cms,"



A Chinese national pleaded guilty to illegally acquiring and possessing the cryptocurrency, worth more than £5 billion ($6.7 billion).Zhimin Qian, also known as Yadi Zhang, led a large-scale scam in China by cheating more than 1,28,000 victims and storing the stolen funds in bitcoin assets between 2014-2017, the Met Police said in a statement, as per BBC.The Met said that the 47-year-old's guilty plea followed a seven-year probe into a global money laundering web. A total of 61,000 bitcoins were seized from Qian, the Met reported. Police said the probe began in 2018 after receiving a tip-off about the transfer of criminal assets.Qian had been ""evading justice"" for five years up to her arrest, necessitating a complex investigation involving multiple jurisdictions, said Detective Sergeant Isabella Grotto, who led the Met's investigation.She fled China using false documents and entered the UK, where she attempted to launder the stolen money by purchasing property, the Met stated. Qian received assistance from a Chinese takeaway worker named Jian Wen, who was jailed for six years and eight months last year for her role in the criminal operation.Wen, 44, laundered the proceeds from the scam and moved from living above a restaurant to a ""multi-crore rented house"" in North London, according to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) earlier this year.She also purchased two properties in Dubai worth more than £500,000, the CPS reported. The Met said it seized more than £300m worth of bitcoin from Wen. Wen claimed that she bought the properties for an employer from China.However, the CPS stated that the large amount of bitcoin and lack of evidence regarding its acquisition indicated it was from a criminal source. Chinese media outlet Lifeweek reported in 2024 that investors, mostly between 50 and 75 years old, had poured ""hundreds of thousands to tens of millions"" of yuan into investments promoted by Qian. The schemes capitalised on cryptocurrency's popularity in China at the time, promising daily dividends and guaranteed profits, according to Lifeweek.Qian's company claimed it would help China become a hub for finance and technology and showcased projects and investments it said it had across the country. Some of the victims—including business people, bank employees and members of the judiciary—were reportedly urged to invest in Qian's scheme by friends and family.The investors reportedly knew little about Qian, who was described as ""the goddess of wealth."" ""Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are increasingly being used by organised criminals to disguise and transfer assets, so that fraudsters may enjoy the benefits of their criminal conduct,"" said Deputy Chief Crown Prosecutor Robin Weyell.""This case, involving the largest cryptocurrency seizure in the UK, illustrates the scale of criminal proceeds available to those fraudsters,"" Weyell added. Monday's conviction marked the ""culmination of years of dedicated investigation"", which involved the police and Chinese law enforcement teams, said Will Lyne, the Met's Head of Economic and Cybercrime Command.The Met stated the investigation is still ongoing. The CPS is working to ensure the fraudsters do not get hold of the stolen funds, the Met reported. Many of the victims had some of their money returned to them by a compensation scheme established in China, the CPS said last year. Qian is being held in custody ahead of sentencing.
