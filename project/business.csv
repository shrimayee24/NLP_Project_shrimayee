NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu chief minister and DMK president MK Stalin on Wednesday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, outlining concern over the sudden cancellation of the Private Haj quota and urging PM to ""take up the matter with Saudi Arabia immediately"" to resolve the issue.In his letter, Stalin drew attention to the distress faced by thousands of Indian Muslim pilgrims , including many from Tamil Nadu, who had been preparing for the upcoming Haj pilgrimage.""I am writing this letter to bring to your attention a matter of urgent concern regarding the sudden cancellation of the Private Haj quota that is causing significant distress among thousands of Indian Muslim pilgrims, including many from Tamil Nadu, who are eagerly preparing for the upcoming Haj pilgrimage,"" Stalin said in the letter.He also highlighted the spiritual importance of Haj, saying, ""As you are aware, the Haj is one of the five pillars of Islam, representing a deeply sacred and once-in-a-lifetime religious duty for Muslims. The pilgrimage holds immense spiritual significance, and pilgrims often spend their lifetime savings to undertake this journey. This year, the Haj is expected to take place from June 4 to June 9, with pilgrims likely to begin their travel to Saudi Arabia in the month of May 2025.""The chief minister provided context on the current year's arrangements, stating that around 1.75 lakh Indian pilgrims had participated in the Haj pilgrimage in 2024.""During 2024, around 1,75,000 Indian Pilgrims partook in Haj pilgrimage. In January 2025, India signed a bilateral agreement with Saudi Arabia, finalising a quota of 1,75,025 pilgrims. The said quota was divided into a ratio of 70:30 among State Haj Committees and Private Haj Tour Operators. Accordingly, State Haj Committees were allotted 122,517 seats, and Private Haj Tour Operators were allotted 52,507 seats for Haj 2025. I am given to understand that there has been a sudden reduction in India's Haj quota by Saudi Arabia; approximately 52,000 Haj seats earmarked for private Haj tour operators have been cancelled. This abrupt decision has left many pilgrims, who have already completed payments, in a state of deep anxiety and uncertainty,"" he wrote.Stalin concluded the letter by requesting the Prime Minister's prompt involvement to help restore the quota and provide relief to the affected pilgrims.""Considering the gravity of this situation, I request that the matter be taken up with the authorities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia urgently and seek an expeditious remedy. I am sure that your intervention will restore the Haj quota and provide reassurance to the pilgrims and their families,"" he added.Several Muslim pilgrims and community leaders have also sought PM Modi's intervention after minority affairs ministry confirmed that 42,000 applicants won't be able to perform Haj in June this year.","Tamil Nadu chief minister and DMK president MK Stalin wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

SC on Urdu use: Language shouldn't divide society,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-on-urdu-use-language-shouldnt-divide-society/articleshow/120361050.cms,"Supreme Court of India

NEW DELHI: At a time when language has become politicised, with incidents of people being attacked in several states for not speaking the local language, Supreme Court has said India's linguistic diversity should be celebrated and it should not cause divisions. It said language was not related to any religion and Urdu was as much an Indian language as Hindi and Marathi, reports Amit Anand Choudhary. SC upheld use of Urdu, along with Marathi, on a signboard of Patur municipal council in Maharashtra's Akola district.T he court said there was a misconception that Urdu was alien to India and observed that it was “pitiable” to consider Hindi as the language of Hindus and Urdu of Muslims, a ploy used by the colonial powers to divide the country. “The prejudice against Urdu stems from the misconception that Urdu is alien to India. This opinion, we are afraid, is incorrect as Urdu, like Marathi and Hindi, is an IndoAryan language. It is a language which was born in this land. Urdu developed and flourished in India due to the need for people belonging to different cultural milieus who wanted to exchange ideas and communicate amongst themselves. Over the centuries, it attained ever greater refinement and became the language of choice for many acclaimed poets,” a bench of Justices Sudhanshu Dhulia and K Vinod Chandra said.“Language is not religion. Language does not even represent religion. Language belongs to a community, to a region, to people; and not to a religion. Language is culture. Language is the yardstick to measure the civilisational march of a community and its people. So is the case of Urdu, which is the finest specimen of Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb, or the Hindustani tehzeeb, which is the composite cultural ethos of the plains of northern and central India,” the bench said.Noting that a petitioner fought a legal battle against Urdu for the last five years before Bombay HC and SC, the court said the petitioner’s misconception over the issue of language should be addressed as many other people may also have the same feeling. The court said language was a medium for exchange of ideas that brought people holding diverse views and beliefs closer and it should not become a cause of their division.The bench said even today, the Hindi used by common people was replete with Urdu words, even if one was not aware of it. “It would not be incorrect to say that one cannot have a day-today conversation in Hindi without using words of Urdu or words derived from Urdu. The word ‘Hindi’ itself comes from the Persian word ‘Hindavi’. This exchange of vocabulary flows both ways because Urdu also has many words borrowed from other Indian languages, including Sanskrit,” it said. The court said Urdu and Hindi were not two languages as per linguists and literary scholars and if Urdu was criticised, it was also a criticism of Hindi in a way. It expressed concern over deterioration of Hindustani language which is a mix of various languages including Hindi and Urdu .“This is not an occasion to have an elaborate discussion on the rise and fall of Urdu, but this much can be stated that this fusion of Hindi and Urdu met a roadblock in the form of puritans on both sides and Hindi became more Sanskritised and Urdu more Persian. A schism exploited by the colonial powers in dividing the two languages on religion. Hindi was now understood to be the language of Hindus and Urdu of Muslims, which is such a pitiable digression from reality; from unity in diversity; and the concept of universal brotherhood,” the bench said. “We must respect and rejoice in our diversity, including our many languages. India has more than 100 major languages,” it added. The court said if people or a group of people residing within the area covered by the Patur municipal council were familiar with Urdu, then there should not be any objection if Urdu was used in addition to the official language, ie, Marathi, at least on the signboard of the municipal council.","Supreme Court of India said language was not related to any religion.

What did SC say?



On Bengal violence



'Waqf by user is an established practice of Islam'



NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday heard a batch of petitions against the Waqf (Amendment) Act and various points of contention concerning the law, including "" waqf by user "", inclusion of non-Muslims on the board and also the violence in Bengal's Murshidabad that broke out during the protest against the law.During the hearing, the Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sanjiv Khanna-led bench, which included Justices Sanjay Kumar and KV Viswanathan, asked solicitor general Tushar Mehta , appearing for the Centre, on how ""waqf by user"" can be disallowed as many will not have the requisite documents to get such waqfs registered.The phrase ""Waqf by user"" refers to land or property that has been treated as waqf over time through continuous public or religious use, even if no formal waqf deed exists.""How will you register such waqfs by user? What documents will they have? It will lead to undoing something. Yes, there is some misuse. But there are genuine ones also. I have gone through privy council judgments also. Waqf by user is recognised. If you undo it then it will be a problem. Legislature cannot declare a judgment, order or decree as void. You can only take the basis,"" the bench said, according to news agency PTI.""The properties declared by courts as waqfs should not be de-notified as waqfs, whether they are by waqf-by-user or waqf by deed, while the court is hearing the challenge to the Waqf Amendment Act 2025,"" the bench added.Mehta submitted that there was a large section of Muslims who did not want to be governed by Waqf act.The bench then asked Mehta, ""Are you saying that from now on you will allow Muslims to be part of the Hindu endowment boards. Say it openly.""The apex court said that when a public trust was declared to be a Waqf 100 or 200 years ago, it couldn't suddenly be taken over by the waqf board and declared otherwise.""You cannot rewrite the past,"" the bench said.Mehta submitted that a joint parliamentary committee had 38 sittings and examined 98.2 lakh memorandums before Parliament's both houses passed it.The Supreme Court on Wednesday said the violence occurring during protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025 is ""very disturbing"".""One thing that is very disturbing is the violence that is taking place. If the matter is pending here then it should not happen,"" the CJI said.Echoing a similar sentiment, solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, said, ""They (protesters) think they can pressurise the system by this.""At least three people were killed and hundreds were rendered homeless in communal violence in parts of Murshidabad district, mainly Suti, Samserganj, Dhulian and Jangipur, on April 11 and 12 during protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act.Senior advocate Huzefa Ahmadi, opposing Waqf Act, said Waqf by user was an established practice of Islam and couldn't be taken away.Kapil Sibal, appearing for the petitioners referred to Waqf Amendment Act and said was challenging the provision that says only Muslims could create Waqf.""How can state decide whether, and how I am a Muslim or not and hence, eligible to create Waqf?"" Sibal asked.He added, ""How can government say only those who are practising Islam for last five years can create Waqf?""Senior advocate Abhishek Singhvi, who represented some of the petitioners, submitted that Waqf Act would have all India ramifications and pleas should not be referred to the high court.The bench on Wednesday did not issue a formal notice and said it would resume hearing on the petitions at around 2 pm on April 17.","The Supreme Court on Wednesday heard a batch of petitions against the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025.

What SC said on inclusion of non-Muslim in Waqf council?



What SC said on violent protests against Waqf Act?



NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday heard multiple petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025.It noted that undoing ""waqf by user"" would create several issues and sought the central government's reply to over 100 petitions challenging the Act. However, it refused to put a stay on the operation of the law.On inclusion of non-Muslim members in the Central and state Waqf boards, the apex court asked if the BJP-led Centre would ""allow Muslims to be part of Hindu religious trusts"". It ruled that ex-officio members could be appointed regardless of religion but others had to be Muslims.The court is set to hear the matter at 2pm on Thursday.The top court noted that most of the mosques were built during 14th and 15th century and and producing a ""registered deed"" was impossible.""Many of the masjids are created in 14th or 15th centuries. To require them to produce a registered deed is impossible. Most of the cases, say Jama Masjid Delhi, the waqf will be waqf-by-user,"" CJI Sanjiv Khanna said. ""If you are going to de-notify waqf-by-user properties, it will be an issue,"" he added.Kapil Sibal had argued that the abolition of the 'waqf by user' provision struck at the core of religious practice, asserting, ""Its my integral part of religion, its recognised in Ram Janbhoomi judgment. Problem is, they will say if a waqf is created 3000 years ago, they will ask for deed.""The removal of the provision is another point of contention driving the anti-Waqf protests . Under the Waqf Act of 1954, properties could be designated as waqf if they had long been used for religious or charitable purposes, even in the absence of official documentation. The amendment does away with this classification, raising concerns and ambiguity over the legal status of many such properties.The apex court has sought clarification over non-Muslim members in the Waqf council. ""Will you allow Muslims to be part of Hindu religious trusts,"" it asked. It said that ex-officio members could be appointed regardless of their faith but others members had to be Muslims.According to the Act, in the Central Waqf Council, up to two of the 22 appointed (non-ex officio) members may be individuals from non-Muslim communities. State Waqf Boards may include up to two non-Muslim members among the 11 appointed (non-ex officio) positions.Addressing the anti-Waqf protests that turned violent in Bengal's Murshidabad killing three, SC said that it was ""very disturbed"".""Once Supreme Court is seized of the matter, this should not happen,"" the CJI said.Violent protests erupted in Murshidabad on April 11 over the contentious Waqf (Amendment) Act, leading to the deaths of three individuals, injuries to many others, and significant property damage.According to the West Bengal Police, 150 people have been arrested so far in connection with the violence, and security has been stepped up with heavy police deployment in affected areas such as Samserganj and Dhuliyan.The BJP-led central government recently notified the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025, following its passage in Parliament amid intense debates in both houses. The bill received President Droupadi Murmu’s assent on April 5. It was approved in the Lok Sabha with 288 votes in favour and 232 against, while in the Rajya Sabha, it passed with 128 members supporting and 95 opposing it.However, a total of 72 petitions have been filed challenging the validity of the Act. Petitioners include AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi , the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB), Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind, the DMK, and Congress MPs Imran Pratapgarhi and Mohammad Jawed. In response, the Centre filed a caveat in the Supreme Court on April 8, requesting to be heard before any orders are issued.","Supreme Court on Wednesday heard multiple petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025.

Congress leaders speak out

Poll Do you think the media coverage of the National Herald case is biased? No Yes

BJP counters with ‘corporate conspiracy’ allegation

What is the National Herald Case?

What happens next?

NEW DELHI: Delhi Police on Wednesday detained several Congress workers protesting outside the All India Congress Committee headquarters at 24, Akbar Road. The protest erupted after the Enforcement Directorate (ED) filed a chargesheet in the National Herald case , naming senior party leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi as key accused.The detained protesters were demonstrating against what they called a ""politically motivated"" move by the Centre to target opposition leaders using investigative agencies. The ED filed its prosecution complaint at Delhi’s Rouse Avenue Court under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002.The protest, which took place in front of the Congress headquarters, saw participation from several senior leaders.Sachin Pilot, former Rajasthan deputy CM, said, “We are seeing this case for a long time. There is no transaction, no transfer of property, no asset movement. I have full faith in the judiciary. This is being done only to divert public attention. Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi will fight legally and politically. The BJP is feeling threatened because we are reviving the party in Gujarat. This is a clear misuse of the ED.”Imran Pratapgarhi, Congress MP and minority cell chairman, said the timing of the chargesheet was suspicious. “You have to understand the chronology—Rahul Gandhi is in Gujarat, Bihar elections are coming, BJP is nervous about Assam, and suddenly this chargesheet appears. This is an attempt to crush the opposition, but they forget this is the Gandhi family—whose sacrifices for the country are unparalleled,” Pratapgarhi said.Supriya Shrinate, Congress spokesperson, launched a scathing attack on the Modi government saying, “This is a 12-year-old case. The government waited till the last day to file the chargesheet, which shows how legally and morally bankrupt they are. No money has exchanged hands. This is a desperate attempt to trap the Gandhi family. Modi is scared of Rahul Gandhi. But vendetta politics will take them only so far. We will fight this in court and on the streets.”Udit Raj, another party leader, called the chargesheet “fake and illegal”. “We want to go to the public. No one is bigger than the people. The people must know this chargesheet is completely baseless.”Congress has announced nationwide protests against the move, particularly in front of ED offices across the country.In a press conference held in Delhi, senior BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad defended the ED’s action and hit back at Congress.“Congress has the right to protest, but they do not have the right to loot land and public funds. This entire case is about misappropriation of funds and assets. In 2008, the National Herald ceased publication. After that, Congress gave ?90 crore to Associated Journals Ltd (AJL), the publisher. This was a clear violation because party funds cannot be given to a private company.”He further alleged, “Young India Ltd was then created, with 38% share each held by Sonia and Rahul Gandhi. This was a corporate conspiracy to grab the assets of AJL. Properties in Delhi, Mumbai, Lucknow, Patna, and Bhopal—valuable properties—were transferred to Young India. And what charity has Young India done since then? None.”Prasad accused the Congress of misleading the public and using protests to distract from the real legal issues.The National Herald was a newspaper founded by Jawaharlal Nehru in 1938, published by AJL. In 2008, AJL stopped publishing. Later, in 2010, Congress leaders created Young Indian Pvt. Ltd. , a company in which Sonia and Rahul Gandhi hold the majority stake.BJP leader Subramanian Swamy filed a private complaint in 2012 alleging that Congress provided Rs 90 crore in loans to AJL, which was later acquired by Young India for a paltry Rs 50 lakh. He alleged this allowed Young India, and by extension the Gandhi family, to effectively control real estate assets worth over Rs 2,000 crore.The ED began investigating under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. On Tuesday, it filed a prosecution complaint (chargesheet) naming Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, and others, including Motilal Vora and Oscar Fernandes.The complaint has been filed under Sections 44 and 45 of the PMLA, for offences under Section 3 (money laundering), Section 70 (offences by companies), and Section 4 (punishment for money laundering).The chargesheet will now be taken up by the Delhi court, and summons may be issued to the accused. Congress has announced continued protests, claiming it will “not be silenced.” Meanwhile, BJP leaders insist the law must take its course and that no one is above the law.","Police detain Congress workers protesting against Central Government and Central agencies, outside their party office.

"As US-China ties crash and burn, eyes turn towards India",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/as-us-china-ties-crash-and-burn-eyes-turn-towards-india-tariff-trade-war/articleshow/120316772.cms,"The TOI correspondent from Washington:

US-China ties are headed for a devastating crash with attention in America now pivoting towards New Delhi to assess if India can -- or will -- step into the breach.More signs of the US-China flame-out emerged on Tuesday after Beijing directed its airlines to stop taking delivery of Boeing aircraft. China is Boeing's biggest customer with projections by the company of delivering nearly 9,000 planes to China — about 20% of the total — over the next two decades. By contrast, India is expected to order around 2400 Boeing aircraft till 2043.Also read: China plays rare earth card as US, India dig deep The Chinese directive also included halting orders of aircraft-related equipment and parts, indicating it is ready to suffer pain and disruption to crank up domestic aircraft manufacturing by the state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), which has been ramping up to take on Boeing and Airbus, the two global aircraft majors.Beijing's blow to Boeing in response to President Trump's tariff gambit came amid growing apprehension in the American commentariat that the MAGA supremo may have overplayed his hand in trying to paint China into a corner -- without rallying support from the rest of the world. There is dismay that on the contrary he has alienated almost the entire world, including European allies.A viral meme showing Trump saying ""I hold the cards"" and Xi responding with ""The cards are made in China"" provided an apt metaphor for the tariff fallout, with many experts saying although both countries will feel the pain from the spat that has inflamed the world, Beijing appears to have more leverage than the Trump White House anticipated, not to speak of greater resilience and endurance to ride out the punishment.US analysts are increasingly looking at India as a potential winner in the trade war expecting New Delhi to take advantage of the tariff differential. ""Is India ready to step in for China?"" the NYT asked in a front page story that said while Trump’s trade war with Beijing could be good for New Delhi, the country's dreams of becoming a new factory to the world is beset with familiar problems -- lack of skilled workers, supply chain issues, infrastructure shortcomings and red tape.But MAGA hardliners, despite being mocked for expecting low-end, assembly-line manufacturing to return to the US, bristle at the idea of depending on India for items like pharmaceuticals after extricating itself from China's dominance. The argument has caused the US President to go back and forth on taxing pharma imports, first holding back on tariffs and later indicating he will review it.In fact, the MAGA Supremo's back-and-forth on the tariff issue on some sectors, including automobiles in the latest instances, has led to allegations of crony capitalism and insider trading as the United States appears to be in far greater turmoil than China and rest of the world after igniting a global trade conflagration.A defensive President Trump pushed back on Monday, asserting that he does not change his mind but he is a ""very flexible person."" Following signs that he's carve out another tariff exception to help the US auto sector, the country's $ 42 billion toy industry, which is heavily dependent on Chinese manufacturing and supplies, is also clamoring for a break arguing that toys are critical for child development.Many liberal pundits are now surmising that instead of running rings around China as the White House mandarins are suggesting the US President is doing, it is Trump who is running around in circles. Amid growing concerns about the Chinese President Xi's high-profile visits to Vietnam and Malaysia, US experts are wondering if Trump has unwittingly ceded global primacy to Beijing.""What if you get into a trade war with China and you lose? What if, after infuriating the rest of the world, putting tariffs on them, too, you make China look stronger, more reliable, more farsighted, more strategic in the eyes of all these other countries that are now looking for an exit from the unreliable consequences of US hegemony?"" the liberal podcaster Ezra Klein asked amid growing self-doubt across US business circles.But Trump made light of the Chinese leader's purported inroads in East Asia, saying he does not ""blame"" China or Vietnam for engaging while seeming to hold out an olive branch to Xi. ""I like him. He likes me. I mean, you know, who knows?” Trump said as Chinese interlocutors continued to taunt the US with a flood of memes, cartoons, and videos. One meme showed Xi holding a pair of aces and Trump holding a two and a seven, about the weakest hand in cards.The distrust engendered by Trump's trade, tariff assault, and geo-political assault on the world, including on allies, is so great that the European Commission is reported to have issued burner phones and basic laptops to some US-bound staff to avoid the risk of espionage in Washington, where they are headed to for the World Bank/IMF meetings, according to the Financial Times. The caution is traditionally reserved for trips to China.","US-China ties are headed for a devastating crash with attention in America now pivoting towards New Delhi to assess if India can -- or will -- step into the breach.

How one of India’s biggest jobs scandals was executed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-one-of-indias-biggest-jobs-scandals-was-executed/articleshow/120359362.cms,"People received appointment letters but were not allowed to join. Non-publication of the fourth phase of the counselling list contrary to the rules. Rank jumping i.e. candidates holding rank below petitioner(s) getting appointment letters.(The WBSSC had not made the merit list public. The rank jumping became apparent only after the CBI got hold of the original database. Also, some candidates managed to secure some answer sheets using RTI.) Candidates in the waiting list for Group D posts in the panel [shortlisted] published on 20.06.2019 were ignored, as a new notification dated 14.06.2021 published initiating a new recruitment process Pick and choose method in selecting candidates and flouting of recruitment rules. Candidate(s) neither in the merit list nor in the waiting list given appointment letters.

Teachers have the onerous task of inculcating values. They have the task of creating and maintaining a pristine atmosphere around a student so as to nurture creativity. It would be naive to accept such qualities from persons obtaining employment by dubious means,"" observed Calcutta high court while setting aside the recruitment process for teaching and non-teaching staff in West Bengal. The HC judgment was upheld by Supreme Court on April 3.The two judgments affected almost 25,000 people recruited for government-aided educational institutes by West Bengal School Selection Commission ( WBSSC ) through a process, which started in 2016 but went on up to 2020. The process, the two courts ruled, was so ""unashamedly"" manipulative that the teachers it produced should have no business to get anywhere near a young student. Of the 25,000 recruitments, more than 18,000 were for teaching staff for classes IX to XII . The sheer number of people affected by the judgment, coupled with the fact that the courts refused to protect those who were supposedly ""untainted"", led to some outrage. The Calcutta HC, however, had given reasons for not being able to separate ""the grain from the chaff"" calling the fraud perpetuated ""too deep and pervasive"" to allow separation of the tainted from the untainted. The two court orders deal in some detail about how the scam was perpetuated from the start to end. Here's how norms were trampled upon in what can possibly be only described as the Great Bengal Recruitment Scam.WBSSC appointed M/s NYSA without any open tender process to evaluate candidates and maintain a soft-copy database of all the tests/exams. NYSA's appointment gave the impression that commission wanted to make sure that NYSA, and nobody else, got the contract. It just invited a few firms to apply and then selected NYSA as it was ""the lowest bidder"".The HC judgment noted that the WBSSC did not produce any document to show if it had done any evaluation to check if NYSA was qualified to carry out the work. ""Letter of appointment of M/s NYSA contains only two lines which requires M/s NYSA to scan and evaluate the OMR sheets. No other terms and conditions of the appointment have been specified,"" the judgment said. As often is the case in such scams, NYSA subcontracted the work of maintaining a soft-copy database of answer sheets to M/s Data Scantech Solutions. While court records mention that the answer sheets were scanned inside WBSSC's offices, WBSSC curiously submitted that it did not even know that the scanning work was carried out by Data Scantech. The court concluded that the appointment of both M/s NYSA and Data Scantech was ""unashamedly orchestrated"" to ""facilitate, implement and perpetuate"" the eventual fraud.The 2016 notification issued by WBSSC for regional and state level selection tests involved 12,905 posts for assistant teachers for classes IX and X; 5,712 assistant teachers for classes XI and XII; 2,067 non-teaching staff under Group C; and 3,956 non-teaching staff under Group D. This meant that the total vacancies across all categories was 24,640. However, after the recruitment process ended, recommendations made by the WBSSC were for only 22,930 posts. There was also a mismatch between the answer sheets data base with WBSSC and data maintained by NYSA in at least 4,091 cases. CBI investigations showed that 8,163 marksheets were manipulated. As per a data set provided by WBSSC, there were 926 cases of rank-jumping and 1,498 people were appointed despite not featuring in any of the tests and, therefore, not being a part of the recruitment process. Some people who were appointed were found to have submitted blank answer sheets. One of Calcutta HC's orders described this number as ""large"".And that is not all. The number of candidates who got the appointment letters outstripped the number of candidates ""recommended for appointment"" by the WBSSC. The gap was significant - 2,355. This took the total appointments to 25,735, 1095 more than the total vacancies across all categories as per 2016 notification.It was the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education (WBBSE) which was responsible for issuing the appointment letters. Before the court, the Board maintained that it received all recommendations from different regional offices of WBSSC - mostly hand delivered and some through the post.Curiously enough, all the records maintained at the WBSSC office were destroyed in July 2019 while the recruitment process was still on. A copy of the database maintained by NYSA was passed on to WBSSC in addition to the physical records that originally existed with WBSSC. Citing a particular rule for the recruitment process, an executive order issued on July 22, 2019 directed destruction of all the records. However, court orders note that WBSSC provided scanned copies to the candidates from 2018 right till 2023, claiming that they were from its WBSSC database.The CBI seized three hard-disks from the house of one of the ex-employees of NYSA in Sept 2022 - over three years after the WBSSC had destroyed its records. Similar files were also recovered from Data Scantech and most of the anomalies like rank jumping were accepted by WBSSC only after these discoveries. Also, the CBI did not find any scanned copies at the WBSSC's offices, which, according to HC, indicated that WBSSC officials were taking NYSA employees' help, after they had destroyed their records, to reply to RTI applications by candidates seeking details of their answer sheets.The WBSSC filed two petitions before Calcutta HC seeking extra posts in recruitment process so that those who were appointed without even appearing for any exam could be retained. This did not go down well with the court and it sought to know who had approved this request, to which WBSSC head took the responsibility. The court, however, sought all records from the WBSSC office pertaining to this request and it came to light that it was approved by the State Cabinet. The principal secretary of the state appeared before HC in Nov 2022 and produced a cabinet note and a cabinet memo regarding the request for supernumerary posts. The cabinet decision was of May that year. Based on the objections raised by the original petitioners and the court's approach, the WBSSC eventually sought to withdraw its petition.The court, however, rejected WBSSC's petition. The HC finally directed the CBI to investigate this aspect as well - creation of supernumerary posts. The Supreme Court in a separate order on April 8, five days after it allowed scrapping of the entire recruitment process, set aside the Calcutta HC order for CBI investigation into WB government's request for supernumerary posts.","Calcutta high court and Supreme Court set aside the recruitment process for teaching and non-teaching staff in West Bengal. The process, the two courts ruled, was so ""unashamedly"" manipulative that the teachers it produced should have no business to get anywhere near a young student. The sheer number of people affected by the judgment led to some outrage.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120360121,imgsize-72626,width-400,resizemode-4/teachers-scam.jpg"
Supreme Court to government: Will you allow Muslims in Hindu trusts?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-to-government-will-you-allow-muslims-in-hindu-trusts/articleshow/120359166.cms,"NEW DELHI:SG said there was no basis for the apprehension of fresh scrutiny of ‘waqf by user’ properties. It was meant to enable only those Muslims who had already created a trust for charity, by assuring that their properties would not be treated as waqf property, he said. CJI said, “Before the British came to India, there was no concept of registering properties on transfer. How will someone produce documentary proof of a waqf if it was done during the 14th to 19th century. Jama Masjid in Delhi may be ‘waqf by user’. Who will produce documentary proof for this? But at the same time, no one can make an absurd claim that Parliament or Delhi HC land is waqf land.”Mehta said Muslim charity commissioners could enter temples and have been entering temples. “The Tamil Nadu govt says it can appoint archaks (pujaris) and the court approves it saying it is a secular function of the govt,” he said, adding, “It is the administration of properties. Nothing to do with the religious affairs of Muslims.”The bench said as long as a non-Muslim was confined to the post of ex-officio member, it was fine. “But as far as other members are concerned, it can’t be that out of 22 members in the council, only eight are Muslim,” the CJI said.The SG said this issue was raised before the Joint Parliamentary Committee and it was emphatically clarified by the minister concerned that a maximum of two out of 22 members would be non-Muslims in the council.“The provisions are now inclusive as membership is expanded to include all categories of Muslims, which was earlier confined only to Shias and Sunnis. Among the members, two must be women, so it has become even more inclusive,” Mehta said. The bench said this was a positive development.Mehta also allayed the SC’s apprehension of immediate reconstitution of the council and boards by saying the existing bodies would continue till their end of tenure. He said that interestingly, among the 150 petitioners, not a single board had approached the SC claiming that it was affected by the changes in the waqf Act.At one point, the SC mulled the option of sending all petitions in the SC and before HCs to one HC. But the Muslim side opposed it and said the issue required adjudication at the earliest. The SG said let the court issue notice to the Union govt, which would respond in detail. However, when the SC intended to dictate an interim order, Mehta and Dwivedi successfully opposed it by seeking to advance arguments.","SG said there was no basis for the apprehension of fresh scrutiny of ‘waqf by user’ properties.

NEW DELHI: In its 75th year of becoming a republic and after a gap of 15 years, India will get its second CJI from Dalit community in Justice Bhushan Ramakant Gavai.Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna on Wednesday wrote a customary letter to the Union government recommending the appointment of Justice Bhushan Ramakrishna Gavai, the most senior judge in the Supreme Court, as the next CJI. Justice Khanna will retire on May 13.The letter to the Union govt declaring his successor to be fit, able and competent to become CJI is customarily written by incumbent CJI a month before his retirement, with some exceptions. CJI Altamas Kabir had unusually delayed sending the customary letter for the appointment of Justice P Sathasivam as his successor.Justice Gavai will be the second one from Dalit community, after CJI K G Balakrishnan, to head the judiciary. Justice Balakrishnan had nearly a three- and half-year tenure as CJI that ended in May 2010. In contrast, Justice Gavai will have a tenure for six months and 10 days as CJI.Justice Gavai, whose father Ramakrishna Suryabhan Gavai was a career politician and senior leader of Ambedkarite movement and one of the founders of established Republican Party of India, will take oath on May 14 to become the 52nd CJI.He will be the eleventh from the Bombay and Nagpur High Court to head the judiciary.

NEW DELHI: Appointed by Tamil Nadu as head of a high-level committee to explore ways & means for greater autonomy for states in a federal governance structure, Justice Kurian Joseph on Wednesday said the endeavour would be to find solutions within constitutional parameters and without compromising the nation's unity and integrity.Justice Joseph, who retired from the Supreme Court in Nov 2018 after spending more than 18 years as a judge of constitutional courts, told TOI that the issue had been the subject matter of debate right from the 1970s, leading to setting up of Sarkaria Commission in 1983 to examine the Centre-state relationship and balance of power between the Centre and states.In its 1988 report, the Sarkaria Commission had given 247 recommendations, including greater financial autonomy for states and appointment of impartial governors. In 2007, the UPA govt had set up another panel headed by former CJI M M Punchhi to review the functioning of arrangements between the Centre and states and had recommended reforms in using Article 356 to dismiss state govts, appointment of governors and strengthening of inter-state council for better Centre-state relations.Justice Joseph said, ""Given the long-standing debate on Centre-state sharing of power and the tussle over finances, which remain more or less unresolved, and the fact that the role of governors continues to remain a thorn in Centre-state relations, especially in light of the recent SC judgment on Tamil Nadu governor's actions on bills passed by the assembly, a judicious study of constitutional provisions has become imperative and solutions to oft-repeated grievances of states need to be sought.""Asked whether the committee would look into the growing tendency of insisting that people of other states working in a particular state should use the local language for day-to-day communication, he Justice Joseph smiled and said, ""Appointment of a person who hails from Kerala as the head of the committee should allay that apprehension.""Born into a large family managed by the modest income of his father serving as a clerk in Kerala HC, Justice Joseph was appointed as a judge of that HC in 2000. He used to go to school barefoot till Class 7.He became a judge of the SC in 2013 and in 2018 participated in the press conference with three other judges led by Justice J Chelameswar to protest then CJI Dipak Misra's alleged allotment of sensitive cases to ""pliant"" junior judges.He said he accepted the Tamil Nadu assignment on one condition - not a single penny would be paid as fee or remuneration.

Poll What’s more important during delays like visa appointments? Quick resolution of the issue Timely updates from authorities

AHEMEDABAD: The road to the American dream has hit a fresh speed-breaker - visa appointments have suddenly gone off the radar for thousands of students from Ahmedabad planning to fly to the US this summer. While the Jan intake went smoothly for students securing visa appointment slots well in time, the situation over the past 20-25 days is starkly different.According to travel industry experts, since mid-March the unavailability of visa interview appointments has left aspirants as well as visa consultants in a fix.""Students had received April slots when they booked appointments in Feb or early March. Now, appointment dates for May are not available at all. They've secured admissions and I-20 forms from universities but are under tremendous stress due to the uncertainty in scheduling visa interviews,"" said Maulin Joshi, a city-based visa consultant."" The post-election period late last year saw one of the smoothest visa cycles in recent memory. Students scheduled to join universities during the Jan intake got quick appointments. That ease is missing now, and it's worrying,"" he added.Industry sources say the recent crackdown by the US embassy in India also had an impact. ""The US embassy is upgrading its systems to plug loopholes being misused through illegal methods to grab visa appointment slots...,"" said Janak Nayak, an immigration consultant.""We've been checking the portal daily, but it's blank. No slots for student visas since March 10. If this continues, many students may miss their Fall 2025 intake timelines,"" said Bhavin Thaker, another foreign education consultant.Industry players suggest that last year, while appointments were available, refusal rates were fairly high, which left students anxious. ""With the new govt taking charge in the US, there are a number of changes in US immigration policies, which has further worried students. With no official communication on when US student visa appointment slots will open, the students are under tremendous pressure,"" said Ritesh Desai, another visa consultant from Ahmedabad who has seen a sharp rise in student walk-ins with similar concerns.",Thousands of students from Ahmedabad planning to fly to the US this summer.

TOI

SRINAGAR: The BJP-led Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council (LAHDC-Leh) has unanimously passed a bill that seeks to provide 33% reservation to women in the hill council.LAHDC-Leh chief executive councillor Tashi Gyalson said the passage of the bill on Tuesday was a move towards “inclusive development and gender equity in one of the remotest and most strategic regions” of India. “We have demonstrated that the remotest regions of the country are ready to lead by example in empowering their women,” he told“For a region like Ladakh, known for its stunning landscapes, yet challenged by geographical remoteness and limited infrastructure, the unanimous approval of the women’s reservation bill is more than just a policy decision. It symbolises a shift in mindset and a decisive push toward inclusive governance,” Gyalson said.The Ladakh region has two hill councils — LAHDC-Leh and LAHDC-Kargil. The Leh hill council came into existence in 1995 when Jammu and Kashmir, then a state including Ladakh, was under prolonged central rule. In 2003, the then J&K chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed established a separate hill council for Kargil.At present, LAHDC-Leh is run by BJP, which won 15 seats in the 26-member council in Oct 2020 in the first polls held after Ladakh was carved out as a UT in 2019. Congress won nine seats, while Independents bagged two. The National Conference-Congress combine swept the 26-member LAHDC-Kargil in Oct 2023, winning 22 seats. BJP won only two seats.Gyalson said the LAHDC-Leh’s move aligns with PM Narendra Modi’s broader vision of empowering women. “The new legislation will open doors for women, especially from rural and far-flung areas, to step into leadership roles, participate in policymaking and shape the future of their communities,” he added.",LAHDC-Leh chief executive councillor Tashi Gyalson said the passage of the bill on Tuesday was a move towards “inclusive development and gender equity in one of the remotest and most strategic regions’ The Ladakh region has two hill councils — LAHDC - Leh and LAH DC - Kargil.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120356468,imgsize-243478,width-400,resizemode-4/Ladakhi-Women-Lead-Community-Dialogue.jpg"

NEW DELHI: India has no intention of getting itself embroiled in a trade war with Bangladesh even though the signalling from Dhaka on trade issues remains far from positive. While Bangladesh has been reported to have blocked yarn imports through land borders from India, Indian government sources maintain that India’s recent withdrawal of the trans-shipment facility extended to Bangladesh in 2020 was meant to ease congestion at Indian ports and airports.India has ensured that this action does not impact Bangladesh's exports to Nepal and Bhutan transiting through Indian territory.Amid a series of anti-India statements and also actions by Dhaka that bordered on trade hostilities, PM Narendra Modi had urged Bangladesh Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus in their recent meeting in Bangkok to avoid rhetoric that could vitiate the atmosphere. The Indian side believes that even before the transshipment facility was blocked, the interim government in Bangladesh had taken steps that threatened to disrupt trade ties.The decisions to shut 3 land ports with India and also to block yarn imports were all taken in March. Dhaka’s decision to “tighten vigilance” at the Benapole Customs House in January was also seen as a restrictive move. Bangladesh knitwear manufacturers have already warned the government that the decision to block yarn imports will prove to be suicidal for apparel exporters.While looking to restrict trade with India, the interim government has also resumed direct trade with Pakistan. Bangladesh agreed in February to purchase 50,000 tonnes of Pakistani rice through the Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP).Amid reports of increasing radicalisation in Bangladesh, the revival of Dhaka’s ties with Pakistan, which India sees as the fountainhead of global terrorism, has been of particular concern to Indian authorities. To start with, Pakistan is reported to be looking for opportunities to boost its exports to Bangladesh.

ED questions Vadra in Haryana land deal case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ed-questions-vadra-in-haryana-land-deal-case/articleshow/120324411.cms,"Robert Vadra (PTI photo)

GURGAON: Enforcement Directorate (ED) Tuesday interrogated Robert Vadra , the businessman-husband of Congress general secretary and LS MP Priyanka Gandhi at its headquarters for six hours in connection with a controversial land deal his company Skylight Hospitality had made in 2008 for Rs 7.5 crore.Vadra, who had missed his first summons on April 8, walked into ED office at 11am and was quizzed over two sessions with a lunch break on his association with the land deal which gave him a handsome return of Rs 50 crore in a matter of a few months. His questioning will continue on Wednesday.This is a new case being investigated against Vadra with two other money laundering probes still in progress related to other land deals in Haryana and Rajasthan. In the present case, Vadra's firm, Skylight Hospitality, bought 3.5 acre in Shikohpur ( Haryana) for Rs 7.5 crore in 2008 from Onkareshwar Properties. The then Congress govt in state under the then CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda granted commercial licences for 2.7 acre shortly afterwards. Four months later, the land was sold to DLF for almost eight times the rate - Rs 58 crore - generating a profit of over Rs 50 crore. Vadra slammed ED's move as an 'attempt to thwart his entry into politics and stop him from raising people's issues'.Action against Vadra came soon after ED issued notices to take possession of over Rs 750 crore worth of land and buildings of Young Indian-controlled Associated Journals Ltd in the National Herald money laundering case. This was followed by the agency filing a chargesheet in the National Herald case where it has made seven individuals and entities as accused, including ex-Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. The court has fixed April 25 as the date of next hearing in order to take cognisance of the chargesheet.On his way to ED office, Vadra said action against him was ""politically motivated"". ""I am not going to be intimidated by this. They can ask me as many questions. I will answer them all. I have nothing to hide,"" he said, adding, ""Whenever I try to raise people's voice or talk of entering politics, this govt uses these agencies to suppress me. I have appeared over 20 times before, submitted 23,000 documents, and sat for 15-hour sessions. Yet, they keep demanding more.""Vadra's land deal in Shikohpur gained national attention in 2012 when IAS officer Ashok Khemka, then director of land registration in Haryana, cancelled the land mutation, citing procedural irregularities. The state transferred Khemka within hours, raising eyebrows. But before relinquishing charge, Khemka submitted a report, setting aside the mutation and questioning the authority of the official who had sanctioned it. In 2013, a three-member IAS panel formed by the then Hooda govt gave a clean chit to both Vadra and DLF.Subsequent BJP govt, which assumed office in 2014, formed Justice Dhingra Commission, which submitted a confidential report.

Tyra Banks pitches a bold new take on the iconic film and reveals she’s already talking with Idris Elba

Tyra Banks says flipping the original casting could make the story even hotter

Tyra Banks reveals she's already in contact with Idris Elba about the idea

Supermodel and entrepreneur Tyra Banks has her sights set on shaking up Hollywood with a modern remake of the classic 1992 romantic thriller The Bodyguard — and she wants none other than Taylor Swift and Idris Elba to lead the cast.In an interview on the Today with Jenna & Friends podcast, Tyra Banks revealed her dream casting idea, pairing global pop sensation Taylor Swift with British actor Idris Elba in a gender-flipped reimagining of the Whitney Houston and Kevin Costner hit. “I think Taylor Swift, 'cause business and commerce, art — she would freakin' sell like crazy,” Banks said, praising Swift’s influence and marketability.The original Bodyguard followed a famous singer (played by Whitney Houston) who is protected by a former Secret Service agent (Kevin Costner) as she faces a stalker threat. Their professional relationship evolves into a powerful romance, cementing the film as a box office success with over $400 million in global earnings.But Banks isn’t just talking nostalgia — she’s envisioning a contemporary twist with a fresh dynamic. “What if we flipped it and it was Taylor Swift and Idris Elba? Hot!” Banks added, pointing out the potential appeal of reversing the racial and gender roles of the iconic duo.This isn’t just fan-fiction — Banks says she’s already connected with Elba about working together. “We’re like WhatsApp friends right now,” she revealed. “I’m like, ‘Are you down?’ He’s like, ‘Yeah, Banks.’ I’m like, ‘Okay, I’m gonna make this happen.’ I feel like we should do, like, the romance thing.”Though Swift has yet to show clear interest in acting full-time, she’s no stranger to the screen, having appeared in Cats, Amsterdam, and her own Eras Tour concert film. With the tour's director reportedly linked to the remake, the stars may be aligning for Swift to make her big acting breakthrough in a legacy role.Also Read: “Taylor has no bones”: Joe Alwyn praised for staying classy post Taylor Swift breakup as his Hollywood stock rises Whether this dream casting takes off or not, the buzz is already heating up — and fans are eager to see if Tyra Banks can turn her bold vision into reality.",Tyra Banks wants Taylor Swift and Idris Elba to star in a gender-flipped remake of The Bodyguard.

Bezos breaks real estate record with Seattle property sale

Bezos relocates to Florida, invests $237 million in Indian Creek estates

Two adjacent properties for $147 million

A third estate purchased in 2023 for $90 million

In a landmark real estate transaction that has captured national attention, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has sold his Hunts Point mansion in Washington for a staggering $63 million. This record-breaking deal has now become the most expensive residential sale in Washington State history, as reported by the Puget Sound Business Journal.The sale not only highlights the enduring appeal of ultra-luxury real estate but also marks a symbolic departure for Bezos from the Pacific Northwest—a region where he built his tech empire. The timing of the sale is also noteworthy, occurring just days before Bezos’ aerospace firm, Blue Origin, completed a high-profile spaceflight carrying an all-female crew, including his fiancée Lauren Sánchez and pop star Katy Perry.Located on the prestigious Hunts Point peninsula along the shores of Lake Washington, the 9,420-square-foot estate boasts three bedrooms and four bathrooms. Originally owned by the late art collector Barney Ebsworth, the home was purchased by Bezos in 2019 for $37.5 million through a trust—an arrangement often used by high-net-worth individuals for privacy.The modern estate features:Jeff Bezos acquired the property in 2019 shortly after his divorce from MacKenzie Scott. The purchase was one of several real estate investments made in the Seattle area during that period. Last week’s $63 million sale surpasses the previous state record for residential property sales, eclipsing 2023’s top transaction—a $38.9 million estate in nearby Medina.This sale marks Bezos’ first major move to divest from his Seattle-area portfolio, although he still retains ownership of a 30,000-square-foot Tudor-style estate known as the La Haye mansion, which he purchased in 2010 for $45 million. In 1998, he also acquired an adjacent property for an additional $10 million.Bezos’ decision to sell the Hunts Point property follows his announcement in December 2023 that he would be relocating to Florida. In a heartfelt Instagram post, he reflected on his decades in Seattle, stating:“I’ve lived in Seattle longer than I’ve lived anywhere else and have so many amazing memories here. As exciting as the move is, it’s an emotional decision for me. Seattle, you will always have a piece of my heart.”Since the announcement, Bezos has purchased multiple properties on Miami’s exclusive Indian Creek Island—commonly known as “Billionaire’s Island.” His acquisitions there total approximately $237 million, including:","Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has sold his Hunts Point mansion in Washington for a staggering $63 million.

Joe Alwyn’s post-breakup conduct earns industry-wide respect

Taylor Swift has also moved on—gracefully

In the high-stakes world of celebrity breakups, Joe Alwyn is emerging not just unscathed—but even more respected. Following his quiet split from global pop icon Taylor Swift in April 2023, Alwyn has kept a dignified silence, which insiders say has only helped his career and personal reputation flourish.The 34-year-old Brutalist actor, Joe Alwyn made headlines earlier this year for his poised presence while presenting at the Oscars, but according to industry insiders, that was only a glimpse of his rising profile. “Joe was very wise during their breakup. He kept his head down and his mouth closed and focused strictly on his work,” a source revealed to Life & Style. “He didn’t give interviews about Taylor or do any social media rants, he didn’t even hit the like button on snarky posts.”That kind of maturity, especially in the era of viral drama, hasn't gone unnoticed. Insiders describe Joe Alwyn as “uber professional and respectful,” a demeanor that’s only helped him earn more credibility within Hollywood. “He’s got proven talent and he’s proven he’s a class act, that goes a long way with the decision makers,” the source added.Taylor Swift, now in a very public relationship with Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce since late 2023, appears to harbor no ill feelings. “Taylor has no bones to pick with him, she’s happily moved on, and he’s kept it classy the whole time,” the insider noted. Even her friends and industry peers have taken notice of Joe’s graceful handling of the split.Swift and Alwyn’s six-year relationship was notably low-key. “For me, I just don’t feel it’s something I want to offer up to be picked apart by people who don’t know about it,” Alwyn said in a 2018 interview with Total Film. Swift echoed the sentiment in a 2019 Guardian interview: “If you and I were having a glass of wine right now, we'd be talking about it—but it's just that it goes out into the world.”Also Read: “Pathetic”: Travis Kelce faces backlash from Swifties over podcast survey, accused of clout-chasing Taylor Swift Since their breakup, Joe Alwyn has remained grounded. “I have tried just to focus on controlling what I can control,” he told The Guardian in January 2025.

Apple again surpasses Microsoft as most valuable company

US President Donald Trump has asserted his direct involvement in securing a relief for Apple as the tech giant’s stock experienced a surge of over 2%, propelling its market capitalisation back above the $3 trillion mark. The iPhone maker experienced this surge after the Trump administration announced temporary tariff exemptions on phones, computers and chips.“I speak to Tim Cook. I helped Tim Cook , recently, and that whole business,” Trump said on Monday (April 14) in a briefing with reporters in the Oval Office, referring to Apple’s CEO.“I don’t want to hurt anybody, but the end result is we’re going to get to the position of greatness for our country,” he added.Trump's comment underscored his administration’s decision to exempt phones, computers and chips (semiconductors) from newly-imposed tariffs, a move crucial for Apple, which manufactures the majority of its iPhones, iPads and MacBooks in China, India and other Asian countries. The President has urged Apple to shift its production locally.However, administration officials have cautioned that these exemptions are temporary, leaving Apple's future tariff burden uncertain.As per CNBC, analysts at Morgan Stanley indicated that the latest developments have reduced Apple's “annualised tariff cost burden” from $44 billion to $7 billion.Nevertheless, Apple has reclaimed its position as the most valuable publicly traded US company, surpassing Microsoft. This followed a dip below the $3 trillion threshold on April 4, triggered by Trump's announcement of “reciprocal tariffs” that would significantly impact China and other manufacturing hubs.Reports said that Apple transported over 1.5 million iPhones aboard six cargo planes from India to minimise the impact of tariffs. Projections indicated that the iPhones that cost $1,599 (top-end iPhone 16 Pro Max in the US) could have surged to $2,300 under the high tariff rate that had been in effect, if Apple imported the phones from China.","Apple's stock experienced a surge of over 2%, propelling its market capitalisation back above the $3 trillion mark.

US President Donald Trump said in a Fox News interview that revenue from sweeping tariffs might be enough to replace the federal income tax, calling it a “real chance” to overhaul the tax system. He cited historical examples from the late 1800s, when tariffs were the government’s primary source of income.“There is a chance that the money is so great that it could replace [income tax],” Trump said, adding, “In the old days, about 1870 to 1913, the tariffs were the only form of money. And that’s when our nation was relatively the richest. We were the richest.”Trump has pushed for Congress to remove taxes on tips and Social Security, and said tariffs could help fund such initiatives. “We were making two billion and three billion dollars a day. We never made money like that,” he claimed, noting a temporary reduction in rates to ease economic transitions.He dismissed the argument that tariffs caused the Great Depression, saying, “The Great Depression came before they put the tariffs on.”In the same interview, Trump praised El Salvador’s anti-crime crackdown under President Nayib Bukele and expressed openness to sending violent American criminals to similar facilities. “He’s made it a very safe place,” Trump said, suggesting that the US should also get “rid of our criminals... allowed to come in by Biden.”The comments come as the administration imposes a 90-day pause on new reciprocal tariffs, while raising duties on Chinese goods to as high as 245 per cent. The tariff moves have shaken financial markets and stoked fears of a recession, even as officials engage in trade talks to reduce the US trade deficit .","US President Donald Trump said in a Fox News interview that revenue from sweeping tariffs might be enough to replace the federal income tax.

Power blackout hits all of Puerto Rico as residents prepare for Easter weekend,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/power-blackout-hits-all-of-puerto-rico-as-residents-prepare-for-easter-weekend/articleshow/120366069.cms,"Power blackout hits at Puerto Rico as residents prepare for the Easter (Source: AP)

SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO: A power blackout hit all of Puerto Rico on Wednesday as the heavily Catholic US territory prepared to celebrate the Easter weekend.All 1.4 million clients were affected, Hugo Sorrentini, spokesman for Luma Energy, which oversees the transmission and distribution of power, told The Associated Press. By late Wednesday night, crews had restored power to nearly 100,000 clients, or about 7%, although the number was expected to fluctuate.Hotels were near capacity, with thousands of tourists celebrating Easter vacations on the island. Tourism officials rushed to reassure them that many hotels and other businesses were operating with generators.Meanwhile, at least 328,000 clients were without water. ""It is unacceptable that we have a failure of this magnitude in the transmission of the electrical system,"" said governor Jenniffer Gonzalez, who cut short her weeklong vacation and flew back to Puerto Rico on Wednesday night.Officials said 90% of clients would likely have electricity 48 to 72 hours after the blackout occurred. It was not immediately clear what caused the shutdown, the latest in a string of major blackouts on the island in recent years.Thousands of Puerto Ricans were fuming over the latest outage, with many renewing their calls that the government cancel the contract with Luma and Genera PR, which oversees generation of power on the island.""This is a total disaster,"" said Orlando Huertas, 68, as he sipped a drink with a friend at a streetside bar and criticized the government for not doing enough to tackle the chronic outages.Dozens of people were forced to walk on an overpass next to the rails of the rapid transit system that serves the capital, San Juan, while scores of businesses including the biggest mall in the Caribbean were forced to close. Professional baseball and basketball games were cancelled as the hum of generators and smell of smoke filled the air. Traffic became snarled as police officers were deployed to busy intersections.Reggaeton superstar Bad Bunny echoed the collective rage, writing on X: ""When are we going to do something?"" The governor pledged late Wednesday that she would cancel the contract with Luma, but noted that while government officials have started analyzing the contract and finding possible replacements, it wouldn't be a quick process.Gonzalez also said that she has requested an in-depth investigation into the blackout, noting that officials already have warned there won't be enough generation of power for this summer, when demand peaks. ""Puerto Rico can't be the island where the power goes out all the time,"" Gonzalez said. ""We're going to take action. Let people have no doubts.""While power restoration on the main island of Puerto Rico was moving slowly to protect equipment, emergency generation stations restored power to the tiny neighboring island of Culebra and parts of neighboring Vieques, said Josue Colon, the island's so-called energy czar and former executive director of Puerto Rico's Electric Power Authority.Those without generators crowded around grocery stores and other businesses to buy ice across Puerto Rico. ""I'm desperate. My generator is broken,"" said Carmen Suriel, who worried about the impact of the blackout on her two children, a six-month-old and a five-year-old with Down syndrome, as the temperature rose across Puerto Rico on Wednesday.Alma Ramirez, 69, said she was frustrated with the constant outages, some of which had already damaged her TV and microwave, forcing her to buy new appliances. ""They have to improve,"" she said of the government. ""Those who are affected are us, the poor.""The island of 3.2 million residents has a more than 40 per cent poverty rate, and not everyone can afford solar panels or generators. While there was a push to use more renewable energy sources under the administration of former US President Joe Biden, which provided Puerto Rico with mega generators and other resources, experts worry that won't happen under U.S. President Donald Trump.Roughly 117,000 homes and businesses on the island have solar rooftops. Meanwhile, petroleum-fired power plants provide 62 per cent of Puerto Rico's power, natural gas 24 per cent, coal 8 per cent and renewables 7 per cent, according to the US Energy Information Administration.Daniel Hernandez, vice president of operations at Genera PR, said at a news conference that a disturbance hit the transmission system shortly after noon on Wednesday, during a time when the grid is vulnerable because there are not many machines regulating frequency at that hour.Veronica Ferraiuoli, acting governor and secretary of state for Puerto Rico, said the White House reached out to local officials and said they are available if needed. Pablo Jose Hernandez, Puerto Rico's representative in Congress, said he would work to ensure that ""Washington understands the real and urgent situation Puerto Ricans face every day.""""The electric grid crisis is frustrating, and after years of blackouts, it feels like it's going from bad to worse,"" he said. The last islandwide blackout occurred on New Year's Eve.Puerto Rico has struggled with chronic outages since September 2017 when hurricane Maria pummeled the island as a powerful Category 4 storm, razing a power grid that crews are still struggling to rebuild. The grid already had been deteriorating as a result of decades of a lack of maintenance and investment under Puerto Rico's Electric Power Authority, which is struggling to restructure more than $9 billion in debt.","All 1.4 million clients were affected, spokesman for Luma Energy said. Crews had restored power to nearly 100,000 clients, or about 7%.
