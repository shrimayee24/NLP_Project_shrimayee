NEW DELHI: The National Medical Commission has introduced a non-refundable one-time registration fee of Rs 2 lakh plus 18% GST for institutions seeking to start new MBBS colleges or increase undergraduate seats from the 2026–27 academic year. It has also cleared around 450 additional postgraduate (PG) medical seats for 2025–26 through the appeal process and removed the cap that limited MBBS seat expansion applications to 100 seats at a time.Explaining the new fee, Dr M K Ramesh, president of the Medical Assessment and Rating Board, said the move is aimed at ensuring serious intent and accountability, stressing that establishing a medical college cannot be treated as a routine business decision. He said the registration fee is separate from the existing application fee of Rs 5 lakh for 50 MBBS seats, which rises with higher intake, and only partly offsets the cost of inspections, including travel and stay for three to five assessors conducting multi-day assessments.“The fee applies equally to government and private colleges, generates a unique registration number for tracking applications, and is payable again only if an institution applies in a subsequent academic year, as reapplication is not permitted within the same year,” he said.On MBBS expansion, Dr Ramesh said the earlier 100-seat cap was withdrawn because it had no explicit backing in existing regulations and could not be legally sustained. While the cap was intended to prevent sharp jumps from 50 directly to 250 seats, it was removed after being found unsupported in law. The official said new medical colleges can apply for up to 150 MBBS seats, while existing colleges with 150 seats can expand up to 250, with applications considered on an all-or-nothing basis. Inspections will be intensified for institutions seeking large, single-cycle expansions.On postgraduate admissions, he said PG seat approvals by the first appeal committee are cumulative and ongoing. While earlier notices cited 171 and later 262 additional seats, the total PG seats cleared through appeals so far is around 450, with further additions possible. The additional PG seats—mostly incremental increases of one to four seats per programme—span high-demand specialties including general medicine, radiodiagnosis, dermatology, paediatrics, orthopaedics, obstetrics and gynaecology, psychiatry and general surgery, across medical colleges nationwide.According to the available list, most of these seats have gone to private medical colleges, though some government institutions are also included.The MARB has directed counselling authorities to include the newly sanctioned PG seats without waiting for individual Letters of Permission (LoPs), treating the consolidated list uploaded on the NMC website as a valid document for counselling.

NEW DELHI: Isro will usher in the new year with the first launch of 2026 — PSLV C62 mission — on Monday (January 12) at 10.17 am from the first launchpad at the Sriharikota spaceport. The rocket will launch an advanced earth observation satellite EOS-N1 (codenamed ‘Anvesha’), another ‘eye in the sky’ that will boost India’s surveillance powers from space. Besides the primary payload EOS-N1, PSLV will also be carrying an European demonstrator satellite and 17 other satellites belonging to Indian and foreign agencies.EOS-N1 is a hyperspectral imaging satellite developed primarily for the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). It is capable of “seeing” in hundreds of wavelengths to identify materials on the ground—making it a high-priority asset for national security and surveillance. It will help India secure its borders because of its advanced remote sensing capabilities and will also be used in various fields such as agriculture, urban mapping and environmental observation.Besides EOS-N1, 18 secondary payloads, including Europe’s Kestrel Initial Demonstrator (KID), will piggyback on the primary satellite and will be placed in space. The KID mission will feature an experimental re-entry of a small capsule in collaboration with a Spanish startup, with a planned splashdown in the South Pacific Ocean.Other secondary payloads are cubesats from Indian startups and universities, including OrbitAID's AayulSAT, CV Raman Global University's CGUSAT-1, Dhruva Space’s DA-1, Space Kidz India’s SR-2, Assam Don Bosco University’s Lachit-1, Akshath Aerospace’s Solaras-S4 and Dayanand Sagar University’s DSAT-1.Bengaluru-based space startup OrbitAID Aerospace is set to make history with AayulSAT, India’s first on-orbit satellite refuelling payload. AayulSAT aims to extend satellite lifespans by enabling refuelling and servicing in orbit, addressing space debris and sustainability challenges.The upcoming PSLVC62 mission is also seen as a comeback for the PSLV programme following the earlier setback with PSLV-C61 in May 2025. The earlier PSLV-C61 mission had failed to launch EOS-09 earth observation satellite due to a technical issue in the rocket's third stage, specifically a drop in chamber pressure, preventing the satellite from reaching its intended sun-synchronous polar orbit. While the first two stages performed normally, the anomaly in the third stage led to the mission failure.",Isro will usher in the new year with the first launch of 2026 — PSLV C62 mission.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday backed the use of electric vehicles as Delhi continues to battle air pollution. The apex court said that car ownership has turned into a status symbol and urging greater responsibility from rricher sections of society.Hearing a plea related to air pollution, CJI Surya Kant remarked that personal transport choices were contributing significantly to the crisis.“Car has become a status symbol… People are saving money to buy cars and have stopped using cycles,” the CJI said, as reported by PTI.The CJI said, “The rich people should also sacrifice. Instead of going for high-end vehicles, they should go for good electric vehicles.”Senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi, appearing in the matter, argued that curbing the ownership of multiple vehicles could be one way forward, while also pointing out that the automobile industry wielded considerable influence.The court also came down heavily on the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM), describing it as “failing in its duty” after it sought a two-month adjournment on the issue of temporarily closing or relocating toll plazas at Delhi borders to ease congestion. The bench criticised the authority for a lack of urgency and seriousness in dealing with the pollution emergency.“Have you been able to identify the causes of pollution? … By holding a meeting on January 2 and telling us that we will come after two months, that is not acceptable to us. The CAQM is failing in its duty,” the bench observed orally, refusing to grant the adjournment sought by Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati.",Supreme Court backs use of electric vehicles as Delhi continues to battle air pollution.

BENGALURU: India’s first space mission for 2026 will launch a defence satellite built by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), a satellite for ministry of external affairs (MEA) to be used by Nepal, test on-orbit refuelling technology of a Bengaluru-based startup, aside from 13 other satellites, including foreign ones from UK, France and Brazil.The launch of PSLV-C62 mission, Isro said, is scheduled for January 12 at 10.17 am from the first launch pad (FLP) of the Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC) in Sriharikota. The main satellite the mission will launch is DRDO’s Anvesha, also called EOS-N1.EOS-N1 is designed to provide the Indian military with advanced, unprecedented surveillance advantages over adversaries. The hyperspectral imaging payload can analyse light in hundreds of wavelengths to identify the materials an object is made of, a capability beyond the human eye.While this satellite is expected to bridge the gap in strategic surveillance to some degree, the mission will also launch AyulSAT, built by Bengaluru’s OrbitAID Aerospace, which if successful will be the first step towards India demonstrating the crucial on-orbit refuelling technology which will have far-reaching benefits.OrbitAID founder and CEO Sakthikumar Ramachandran terms AayulSAT more than a mission. “...It’s the foundation of the on-orbit economy,” he says, while the company says: “Years from now, this won’t be remembered as a launch but as the moment India made space serviceable. From India to the world!”A third important satellite will be Munal, built by Nepal’s Antharkshya Pratishtan with help from India’s ministry of external affairs (MEA).It is intended to carry an Earth observation payload to support environmental monitoring and capacity building, marking another step in Nepal’s entry into space-based applications.Aside from these three, the mission will put into orbit 13 more satellites, including five — CGUSAT, DSUSAT, MOI-1, LACHIT and DR-1 — by Indian startup Dhruva Space. They will demonstrate or validate multiple technologies, including indigenous satellite bus capabilities and subsystems, communication and payload subsystems in low Earth orbit, multi-payload integration and operational performance of larger CubeSat platforms, basic satellite operations and communication links, etc.Foreign satellites on the mission include five satellites by Brazil’s AlltoSpace, Theos-2 from SSTL, UK, and KID Capsule by RIDE, France. The five satellites from Brazil are EduSat, Uaisat, Galaxy Explorer, Orbital Temple, and Aldebaran-1.

It was then bifurcated into Ladakh and J&K. Those who split J&K state now want to divide it further and desire to make even Kanak Mandi a state,” minister for jal shakti, environment and tribal affairs Javed Rana said, taking a veiled dig at BJP. Kanak Mandi is a historic wholesale market in Jammu city.BJP legislators were free to raise the issue of separate statehood for Jammu, but there was no such demand from large parts of the region, including Pir Panjal areas of Rajouri and Poonch and the Chenab Valley, said Rana talking to reporters. “Instead, I believe that the day is not far when Ladakh will again become part of J&K,” he added.BJP MLAs, especially former minister Sham Lal Sharma, have renewed calls for a separate Jammu state. Sharma said the demand was not new and that he had raised it way back in 2010, when he was a minister in then Congress govt. Sharma claimed the people of Jammu are more “nationalistic”, while Kashmir, he alleged, has been politically unstable due to the rhetoric of political parties like National Conference that says J&K only acceded to India and did not fully merge with it.Sharma alleged that Jammu was facing discrimination at the hands of “Kashmir-based rulers”. He also called for a Hindu chief minister.On Jan 5, BJP spokesperson Rajni Sethi said Jammu was suffering because of what she described as “fundamentalists in Kashmir”. “When people from Jammu travel outside J&K, they are treated with suspicion and their identity is questioned. People assume Jammu is also influenced by extremism,” she said.Rejecting the charges, NC spokesperson Tanvir Sadiq said: “BJP has no politics except tarnishing Kashmiris and their image.” The govt would not allow BJP members to create a rift between Jammu and Kashmir,, he said, adding: “We believe in equitable development of both regions. The restoration of Darbar Move is an indication of Omar govt’s commitment towards development of Jammu.”","Omar Abdullah govt rejects demand of statehood for Jammu region, calling it ‘unviable’ Minister for jal shakti, environment and tribal affairs Javed Rana said it was time for Ladakh to be reunited with Jammu and Kashmir.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126402055,imgsize-949450,width-400,resizemode-4/minister-of-jal-shakti-environment-and-tribal-affairs-javed-rana.jpg"

Delhi’s Air Pollution Gets Attention, But Most Indian Cities Are As Bad Or Worse | I Witness

NEW DELHI: Taking, in what it called, an important step towards environmental governance and reducing dependence on foreign certification systems, India has set up the world’s second National Environmental Standard Laboratory here at the CSIR–National Physical Laboratory (NPL) that will develop requisite testing and calibration facilities for air pollution monitoring equipment in the country.Currently, most of the instruments used in India for air pollution monitoring are imported. These imported instruments, however, come with production certification from international agencies based on the environmental conditions of the certificate issuing countries.Since environmental conditions of those countries are very different from the conditions prevalent in India, it affects the quality of measurements by the instrument operating for a long time in Indian conditions, CSIR scientists explained. At present, only the UK has such a laboratory.The National Environmental Standard Laboratory, inaugurated by Union science & technology minister Jitendra Singh on 80th Foundation Day celebrations of CSIR–NPL on Monday, will now not only deal with the anomaly arising out of different environmental conditions but also help in manufacturing of standardised monitoring equipment.Domestic production of such instruments will eventually end India’s dependence on import and make it an exporting nation of such equipment to third world countries.The global market value of air pollution monitoring systems is, currently, estimated at $3,997 million.In addition, Singh also inaugurated the National Primary Standard Facility for Solar Cell Calibration, bringing India among a select group of global leaders in photovoltaic measurement standards. Both these facilities will enhance trust in data and drive investment in pollution monitoring and renewable energy.Describing the National Environmental Standard Laboratory as a “critical step towards strengthening India’s environmental governance framework”, Singh said that reliable, India-specific calibration and certification of air pollution monitoring systems was long overdue and would now enable transparent, traceable, and accurate environmental data.The facility will support regulatory bodies, industries, and startups by ensuring that monitoring instruments are tested under Indian climatic conditions. It will thus improve policy enforcement of various schemes including the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP).Terming the facility for Solar Cell Calibration (Solar Energy Complex) a “future-ready facility”, Singh said it would reduce India’s dependence on foreign certification agencies, save foreign exchange, shorten turnaround time for calibration, and enhance investor confidence in the country’s rapidly expanding solar sector.","India has set up the world’s second National Environmental Standard Laboratory.

Although there have been efforts in recent months on sharing of information, it remains difficult, inhibiting the ability of tax officials to undertake proper assessment and reconstruction of transaction chains.India is among a group of countries which have so far been reluctant to allow cryptocurrency and stablecoin despite intense lobbying and pressure from some govts. Earlier, on multiple occasions, RBI had flagged its concerns, including the lack of any underlying asset making it a risky bet for investors, and even enforcement agencies are wary especially due to VDAs being instruments that can be used for money laundering and terror financing.The tax department said that since crypto platforms operate overseas, enforcement action may be tough, including issuing summons, or TDS collection. Many of the exchanges are also unregistered with the Financial Intelligence Unit and are outside the ambit of the tax department.Indian tax authorities have sought to build in safeguards, including TDS, to track beneficiaries and have also mandated registration of entities dealing in crypto and other VDAs.","In a presentation to the parliamentary standing committee of finance, the tax authorities flagged as to how anonymous, borderless and near-instant value transfer made it possible to move funds through a system without regulated financial intermediaries.

India Reveals First Vande Bharat Sleeper Offering Faster Overnight Travel On Kolkata-Guwahati Line

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi is scheduled to flag off 13 trains next week, including the country’s first Vande Bharat sleeper train. Ten of these will be flagged off from poll-bound West Bengal and the remaining three from Assam, which is also going to the polls.TOI has learnt that on Jan 17, Modi will flag off Vande Bharat sleeper train from Howrah to Guwahati and six Amrit Bharat trains from Malda, where he will address a public event as well. The next day, he is scheduled to flag off two Amrit Bharat trains from Assam and three more from West Bengal.Officials said this is the first time in recent years that so many trains will be flagged off from West Bengal in such a short span of time. “The Amrit Bharat trains from West Bengal will be for all parts of the country — north, south and west. Amrit Bharat trains are the most affordable for the poor and the middle class, offering best comforts to passengers,” said an official.As per the plan, one Amrit Bharat train will operate between Guwahati and Rohtak (Haryana) and another between Dibrugarh and Lucknow. The Amrit Bharat trains from West Bengal are New Jalpaiguri-Nagercoil, New Jalpaiguri-Tiruchirappalli , Alipurduar-Bengaluru, Alipurduar-Panvel, Balurghat-Bengaluru, Radhikapur-Bengaluru, Santragachi (Kolkata)-Tambaram, Howrah-Anand Vihar (Delhi) and Sealdah-Banaras.“The focus is on running more Amrit Bharat trains as these cater to a large share of long-distance passengers. The zonal railways will soon notify the fares for each service,” said a railway official.So many modern trains being flagged off from West Bengal is being seen as a message that Centre is keen to improve transport infrastructure in the state.","PM Narendra Modi is scheduled to flag off 13 trains next week, including the country’s first Vande Bharat sleeper train.

The project will connect the Delhi–Mumbai Expressway with the Bundelkhand Expressway and will pass through parts of Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh.The 420-km expressway, a mix of expansion of existing highway stretches and construction of a greenfield section, would cost around Rs 14,000 crore. Road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari confirmed this to TOI on Tuesday. The decision was taken at a review meeting chaired by Gadkari on Monday evening and was attended by MP CM Mohan Yadav and two Union ministers — Bhupender Yadav and Jyotiraditya Scindia.National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) will build the 6-lane access-controlled corridor. Officials said the alignment of the project was reworked after the earlier plan faced some issues. “The new alignment falls outside forest and wildlife areas, and also outside the Chambal ravines (beehad). After major modification in the alignment, the environment clearances have been obtained. The project will benefit aspirational (backward) regions in all the three states,” said an official.The access-controlled corridor will connect Kota in Rajasthan with Etawah in UP and cities in MP, including Morena and Bhind. This will reduce both travel time from 10-11 hours at present, to only 5-6 hoursOfficials said the corridor will also provide connectivity to Agra-Jhansi, Kota-Jhansi-Kanpur and Agra-Kanpur highways. They added that the corridor is envisioned as a critical infrastructure aimed at improving connectivity and facilitating faster movement of goods and passengers across the region.","The 420-km expressway, a mix of expansion of existing highway stretches and construction of a greenfield section, would cost around Rs 14,000 crore.

As the dust settles on 2025, Parliament carries forward unfinished business, unresolved disputes,t and reforms still searching for their final shape.The Winter Session restructured key pillars of governance, but several high-stakes bills were deferred, diluted or sent for further scrutiny.The Budget Session of 2026 is expected to move beyond diagnosing problems to implementing solutions — laying out the governing blueprint for the government’s vision of “Viksit Bharat”.With a focus on higher education reforms, electoral synchronisation, capital market restructuring and insolvency resolution, the Budget Session of 2026 sets the stage for high-stakes legislative action.While the government pushed through several landmark reforms during the Winter Session, many bills were formally introduced but ran into procedural hurdles.Several were referred to Joint Parliamentary Committees or held back for further refinement, effectively shifting the legislative battleground to the Budget Session of 2026.Hailed by the government as a “constitutional moment” for India’s financial markets, the bill seeks to streamline three major laws governing investors and market regulation.For over three decades, investors and companies have navigated three separate laws — the SEBI Act (1992), the Depositories Act (1996) and the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act (1956).Given its scale and potential impact on trillions of rupees in market wealth, the bill was referred to the Standing Committee on Finance in late 2025 for detailed scrutiny, before it returns to Parliament in 2026.Critics argue that merging these laws risks turning SEBI into “judge, jury and executioner”, with sweeping enforcement powers.The government, however, has argued that unified regulation is essential to reduce overlap, regulatory arbitrage and compliance confusion in a rapidly expanding market.The bill seeks to fine-tune India’s corporate bankruptcy exit framework.The bill aims to make the resolution faster so that companies do not lose the value of their assets during long legal proceedings. It also introduces a ""Cross-Border Insolvency"" framework to help banks recover money from defaulting companies that have hidden or kept assets in foreign countries.Critics argue that banks take big losses in recovering a very small percentage of the original loans, and that the bill does not hold the big promoters accountable enough.They also highlight the pending judicial cases in the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) due to vacant judges' seats for the proceedings.Opposition has also flagged delays caused by vacancies in the National Company Law Tribunal, arguing that legislative fixes alone cannot address systemic capacity gaps.The One Nation One Election (ONOE) reform proposes to hold simultaneous elections for the Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies, consolidating the voting process to occur at the same time instead of staggered intervals.The government initiated this plan in late 2024 with the introduction of the Constitution 129th Amendment Bill. While the bill gained majority votes in the Lok Sabha, it was not passed. This is because amending the Constitution requires a special majority where at least two-third of the members present in the House must vote in favour of the bill.The Lok Sabha approved a motion to refer both the two bills that shall pave the way for ""one nation one election"" to a 39-member Joint Parliamentary Committee. This committee has been granted an extension to submit its report until the first day of the last week of the Budget Session 2026.The primary objective of the bill is to conduct simultaneous elections—initially for the Lok Sabha and State Assemblies, and later potentially for local bodies—to reduce election expenses and prevent the repeated imposition of the Model Code of Conduct.The opposition rejected the bill as a ""heinous conspiracy"" against federalism, arguing it assaults the Constitution's basic structure and undermines regional autonomy.The bill is the main part of the government’s plan to modernise higher education by bringing several regulators under one system.It was introduced in the Lok Sabha on December 15, 2025, and was later sent to a Joint Parliamentary Committee, the report of which is expected to be presented by the last day of the first part of the Budget Session 2026.The bill proposes setting up the Viksit Bharat Shiksha Adhishthan, or VBSA, as a single umbrella regulator, meaning one main authority that will replace UGC, AICTE, and NCTE. The government has described this system as one with fewer controls but strict enforcement, in line with the National Education Policy 2020.The opposition, however, argued that it gives too much power to the Union government and could weaken the independence of universities, especially because the power to give financial grants will shift from the regulators to the ministry.Although the Digital Personal Data Protection Act was passed in 2023, it came into effect only in late 2025, when the government notified the detailed rules needed to put it into practice.The rules were officially notified on November 14, 2025, after wide public consultation.With implementation now underway, parliamentary oversight is expected on regulatory amendments, institutional capacity and funding for the Data Protection Board.Also, while the law itself was already in force, civil society groups and opposition voices focused their criticism on the rules, especially the 18-month compliance period, which they felt was too long and delayed real protection.One of the most socially and politically sensitive legislations in recent sessions, the bill was first introduced in August 2024 and was swiftly referred to a Joint Parliamentary Committee following widespread protests.The committee, chaired by Jagdambika Pal, submitted its final report in late January 2025 after several contentious meetings. The report recommended mandatory registration of all Waqf properties on a centralised online portal and proposed 44 amendments to the original Waqf Act of 1995.The legislation introduces multiple legal changes, including renaming the Waqf Act as the UMEED Act — the Unified Waqf Management, Empowerment, Efficiency and Development Act, 2025.While the bill is not formally listed on the agenda for the Budget Session of 2026, its implementation, set to begin this year, is expected to trigger renewed uproar.At its core, the legislation seeks to overhaul the governance and management of Waqf properties across the country.If Parliament were a 75-year-old house, the 2025 session resembled a noisy renovation. The government did not limit itself to cosmetic changes: labour laws were reworked, nuclear policy rewired, welfare delivery redesigned and decades-old statutes discarded. The result was a modernised legal framework — albeit amid sustained protest.With debates over worker rights, accountability and foreign participation dominating proceedings, the session concluded with several laws passed, but left many political and social questions unresolved as Parliament heads into 2026.Replacing MGNREGA, the VB–G RAM G Bill — Viksit Bharat–Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) — was tabled on December 15, 2025, and passed three days later through a voice vote amid opposition demands for a recorded division.The law increases guaranteed workdays from 100 to 125 annually but introduces fixed, state-wise allocations, replacing MGNREGA’s demand-driven funding model. Critics argue this risks weakening the programme’s role as a distress buffer.The removal of Mahatma Gandhi’s name became a major flashpoint, alongside concerns over the use of AI and biometric attendance systems that could exclude workers in low-connectivity areas.Passed by voice vote in both Houses, the SHANTI Bill replaces the Atomic Energy Act (1962) and the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act (2010), allowing private and foreign participation in nuclear power generation.The law grants statutory status to the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board and clears the path for small modular reactors. Opposition parties staged a walkout, objecting to diluted supplier liability provisions and warning that public risk would shift to the state in the event of an accident.Passed on December 16, 2025, the bill raises FDI limits in insurance from 74% to 100%, aiming to achieve universal insurance coverage by 2047.While the government argues this will deepen penetration and reduce costs, critics warn of foreign dominance, reduced focus on rural markets and potential pressure on domestic players like LIC.Unanimously passed, the bill introduces a capacity-based cess on pan masala manufacturing machinery to fund public health and national security needs.By taxing production capacity rather than declared sales, the law aims to curb under-reporting. Manufacturers, however, argue the model is inflexible, especially during machinery downtime, while opposition parties flagged concerns over Centre–state fiscal balance.Marketed as a clean-up exercise, the bill repeals 71 obsolete laws, some dating back to the 19th century, including the Indian Tramways Act (1886).While the government said this would simplify compliance, the opposition criticised the bulk repeal approach, arguing that several laws enacted as recently as the last decade were removed without adequate scrutiny.Though passed earlier, the four labour codes entered operational phase in November 2025, consolidating 29 laws into four frameworks covering wages, social security, industrial relations and workplace safety.The new 50% basic wage rule strengthens retirement benefits but reduces immediate take-home pay. Trade unions argue the codes tilt the balance in favour of employers, while the government maintains they modernise labour regulation for a changing economy.Several issues dominated debate without resolution.The opposition accused the Special Intensive Revision exercise in nine states and three UTs of selectively deleting voters. A 10-hour debate ended in deadlock, with no changes to election procedures.Despite repeated demands, Parliament saw no dedicated discussion on Manipur, where President’s Rule remains in place. Political blame-trading replaced consensus on a peace roadmap.Acknowledged as a national health emergency, air quality was debated but left without legislative follow-through or a national clean air framework.As Parliament heads into the Budget Session of 2026, the legislative record of the past year offers both momentum and caution. Several reforms have been passed, others deferred, and many now enter the more difficult phase of implementation. Whether the coming session delivers clarity, consensus and course correction — or repeats the disruptions of 2025 — remains to be seen.","The Budget Session of 2026 is expected to move beyond diagnosing problems to implementing solutions.

April 1-Sept 30: Govt notifies timeline for 1st phase of Census; to be held digitally for first time​​,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/april-1-sept-30-govt-notifies-timeline-for-1st-phase-of-census-to-be-held-digitally-for-first-time/articleshow/126404351.cms,"Census to be held digitally for first time



New Delhi: The Union home ministry Wednesday formally notified the timeline for the first phase of Census 2027 — involving housing and houselisting operations — declaring that it shall be conducted over a 30-day period, to be specified by each state or Union territory, between April 1 and Sept 30 this year.Invoking its powers under Sections 3 and 17A of the Census Act, 1948, read with 6A and 6D of Census Rules, 1990, and in supersession of the notification dated Jan 7, 2020, “except as respects things done or omitted to be done before such supersession”, the Centre declared in the notification that the houselisting operations of Census 2027 shall have an option for self-enumeration, “which shall be conducted in 15 days’ time just before the start of house-to-house houselisting operations of 30 days”.The release of schedule for first phase of the exercise formally kickstarts what was a decennial exercise, before the Covid outbreak delayed Census 2021. It shall be conducted in two phases - houselisting and housing census followed by population enumeration - between April 1, 2026 and Feb 28, 2027, with 00:00 hours of March 1, 2027, as the reference date (except for UT of Ladakh and snow-bound areas and non-synchronous areas of J&K, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand).On Dec 12 last year, the Union cabinet chaired by PM Modi had approved the proposal for conducting Census of India 2027 at a cost of Rs 11,718.2 crore. The population enumeration phase of the latest census will also capture caste identity.About 30 lakh field functionaries will be involved in the Census, the largest administrative and statistical exercise in the world. Being the first digital census, it will involve the use of mobile app for data collection and a central portal for monitoring purposes, ensuring better quality data.The govt had last month stated that Census data dissemination will be much better and done in a user-friendly way so that all queries on required parameters for policymaking are available at the click of a button.Census-as-a-service (CaaS) will deliver data to ministries in a clean, machine-readable and actionable format.The Census process involves visiting each and every household and canvassing separate questionnaires for houselisting & housing census and population enumeration.The enumerators, generally government teachers and appointed by state govts, will do the Census fieldwork in addition to their regular duties.A dedicated portal, namely Census Management & Monitoring System (CMMS) portal, has been developed for managing and monitoring the entire process on a real-time basis. Public can self-enumerate through the Census app or portal in the 15-day period before start of the 30-day houselisting phase in their state/UT. Suitable security features have been provisioned for the digital census.","Census 2027 will be conducted over a 30-day period, to be specified by each state or Union territory.

Govt considers raising EPFO monthly wage cap to Rs 25k-30k; current Rs 15k ceiling fixed in Sept 2014,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-considers-raising-epfo-monthly-wage-cap-to-rs-25k-30k-current-rs-15k-ceiling-fixed-in-sept-2014/articleshow/126403263.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a move that could significantly enhance the coverage of Employees Provident Fund Organisation, a proposal to increase monthly wage ceiling beyond the current Rs 15,000 is back on the table amid suggestions that it should be raised to Rs 25,000-30,000 a month.The wage ceiling refers to the salary threshold up to which it is mandatory for a worker in an establishment covered under EPFO to make monthly contributions.Govt had earlier discussed a proposal to increase the threshold to Rs 25,000 - but it was put on the backburner due to reluctance of employers, who wanted the limit to be retained, with some suggesting that a higher cap should come with lower contribution. Some of the employee unions, however, had demanded a Rs 30,000 cut-off.The current ceiling was fixed over a decade ago, in Sept 2014, making it optional for anyone earning over Rs 15,000 to be part of EPFO. Since then, salaries have gone up significantly, and minimum monthly wages in many states even for unskilled workers are now above this threshold. This leaves many low wage or minimum wage earners outside the ambit of the social security organisation. Earlier this week, Supreme Court asked the labour ministry to review the cap within four months.The move will widen EPFO's subscriber base and bring more workers, especially in the unorganised sector, under the ambit of the retirement fund body. It comes at a time when the new labour codes have been notified, being likely to be implemented in the next few months with a clear focus to ensure that an employee's wages add up to at least 50% of the total remuneration, with the remaining being allowances.Officials said by clearly defining wages, the labour codes would reduce disputes over eligibility. They also said at the current cap, the bulk of contributions amount to around Rs 15,000 and increase will push up the level, helping workers have a larger pool of money at their disposal when they retire, especially with the role of compounding playing out. Recently, EPFO had mandated a minimum 25% balance in a subscriber's corpus while easing rules for withdrawal.Data available till FY24 has pegged the number of active contributing members under EPFO at nearly 7.4 crore, while nearly 32 crore member acco-unts exist under the retirement fund body, which include a mix of active and past contributors.","The wage ceiling refers to the salary threshold up to which it is mandatory for a worker in an establishment covered under EPFO to make monthly contributions.

The decision was taken by the Bihar unit of all india jewellers and gold federation at a meeting with the district jewellers' associations on Tuesday, citing security reasons as gold and silver prices have been on the rise, federation president Ashok Kumar Verma said.Patna jewellers have already started putting notices to this effect outside their shops. Verma said the decision is not against any community or group, but only a pre-emptive security measure.The federation's president, Pankaj Arora, said on Wednesday the decision will gradually be implemented across the country. ""Customer's face must be visible. He or she will not be allowed to enter a jewellery shop in any kind of veil, be it 'hijab', full helmet or 'pagdi/safa' (turban). There is no restriction on 'burqa' as such but no veil,"" he said.Arora said a similar decision was taken by Jhansi jewellers a few days ago following the incidents of theft in shops. ""But Bihar is the first to implement it across the state. Even police question us about the identity in case of loot or theft as the person with face covered is not identified in the CCTV cameras.""Asked if it would affect business or what if a customer refuses to abide, Verma, who was in Delhi to attend the CAIT (Confederation of All India Traders) meeting, said any genuine person will cooperate.""Only anti-social elements will resist. But we will politely refuse to serve them. In case of any trouble, we will inform the police. After all, a 10gm gold chain costs around Rs 1.41 lakh and silver is over Rs 2.5 lakh/kg.

Nearly 3cr voters struck off as UP draft rolls published; those left out have till Feb 6 to file objection,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nearly-3cr-voters-struck-off-as-up-draft-rolls-published-those-left-out-have-till-feb-6-to-file-objection/articleshow/126384323.cms,"Owaisi Calls SIR a ‘Backdoor NRC’ in Lok Sabha, Warns of Selective Religious Disenfranchisement

NEW DELHI: About 2.9 crore electors, making up 18.7% of Uttar Pradesh’s 15.4 crore electorate as it stood at the launch of special intensive revision (SIR) in the state on Oct 27, 2025, have been struck off the state’s draft electoral roll published on Tuesday.UP’s draft electoral roll published following the enumeration phase of SIR-Phase 2 lists over 12.5 crore electors; while deleting 46.2 lakh (2.99%) on account of being deceased; 2.17 crore (14.1%) for having permanently shifted or found untraceable or absent during visits by the booth level officers (BLOs); and 25.5 lakh (1.6%) for being enrolled at multiple places.Sources further indicated that while the percentage of electors found permanently shifted from their polling areas in UP is around 8.4%, those marked as untraceable or absent are over 5.1%. An official said the higher rate of permanently shifted electors in UP (8.4%), as compared to Bihar (4.6%) may not be surprising, citing a Down to Earth survey from 2021 that put the overall migration rate for UP at around 28.4% as against 14.2% for Bihar. District-wise draft electoral rolls published on Tuesday show that Lucknow recorded the highest rate of deletions of permanently shifted electors (13.4%), followed by Ghaziabad (12.7%) and Meerut (11.6%).As per district-wise draft voter lists, the percentage of overall deletions in 22 of UP's 75 districts exceeds the state's average 18.7% deletions. These districts include Lucknow (with over 30% deletions), Ghaziabad (28.8%), Balrampur (almost 26%) and Kanpur Nagar (25.5%); the exclusions in the four districts amount to more than one-fourth of their total electorate as it stood on Oct 27, 2025. Meerut has recorded the least deletions at 9.9%, followed by Hamirpur at 10.8%. A study of deletions however shows no pattern on lines like the religious composition of districts or proximity to the international border.A statement put out by the UP chief electoral officer (CEO) on Tuesday explained that the BLOs did not find the ‘deleted’ electors or did not get back their enumeration forms because they “have shifted permanently to somewhere else from their previous place of residence; were found missing or absent from the concerned polling area, or somehow did not submit the form, till Dec 26, 2025”.The statement however added that genuine electors excluded from the draft roll can still be added back during the claims and objection period from Jan 6 to Feb 6, 2026 by filling up Form-6 along with the declaration form and submitting relevant documents to prove their eligibility.“The name of the electors found enrolled at multiple places in electoral rolls will be retained only at one place,” said the UP CEO.The notice period, covering hearings and verification, will stretch from Jan 6 to Feb 27, 2026, followed by publication of the final electoral roll of the state on March 6, 2026.Electors wanting to check the names in UP draft electoral roll may refer to the copy available with local BLO or visit the ECINet app or website of the UP CEO or ECI.Meanwhile, young electors who have attained 18 years of age on or before 01.01.2026 are being encouraged to apply through Form-6 along with the prescribed declaration form and relevant documents. So far 15.8 lakh Form 6 (with or without declaration) have been collected across UP for inclusion of new electors.Booth-level lists of electors reported as deceased, permanently migrated, untraceable, or whose forms were not received have already been shared with the parties’ booth level agents (BLAs) for verification. Printed and digital booth-wise copies have been provided to all recognised parties and also made available on the CEO’s website.The entire election machinery, supported by volunteers, is assisting electors, particularly senior citizens, persons with disabilities and vulnerable groups.As per Para 5(b) of SIR guidelines, no name shall be deleted from the draft roll without notice and a speaking order by the electoral registration officer (ERO)/Assistant ERO. Any aggrieved elector may seek redressal through a two-stage appeal process, first by approaching the district magistrate and finally the state CEO.EC on Tuesday reiterated “its firm commitment to a transparent, participative and inclusive revision process, ensuring that no eligible elector is left out and no ineligible name remains in the electoral roll”.EC is undertaking SIR exercise in UP, along with others 11 states/UTs covered in Phase 2. ""with full transparency at every stage of the process,” said a spokesperson.A total of 12.5 crore of UP’s 15.4 crore of electors submitted their enumeration forms till the last date of enumeration period i.e., 26.12.2025 “reflecting an overwhelming participation in the first leg of SIR,” UP CEO office said on Tuesday.It attributed the successful completion of enumeration phase to the coordinated efforts of district election officers (DEOs) of all 75 districts, 403 EROs, 2,042 AEROs (AEROs) and BLOs deployed at over 1.6 lakh polling booths, supported by volunteers.

Marjorie Taylor Greene introduces a bill to abolish H-1B program just prior to stepping down,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/green-introduces-a-bill-to-abolish-h-1b-program-just-prior-to-stepping-down/articleshow/126392128.cms,".

U.S. Rewrites H-1B Rules, Setback To Indian Workers; Check Who Is Eligible & Changes | WATCH

Republican firebrand Marjorie Taylor Greene, long known for her staunch “America first” rhetoric, has introduced a bill in the House of Representatives seeking to completely terminate the H-1B visa program, a key pathway for skilled foreign workers, a significant number of whom are from India.The legislation, designated HR 6937, was filed in the House on January 2, and proposes to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to eliminate the H-1B visa category “and for other purposes.” According to immigration experts, while it is unlikely to secure the support needed to become law, it has ignited fresh debate on the H-1B program.According to a report issued by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), of the total H-1B applications (including extensions) approved in fiscal 2024, 71% or about 2.8 lakh were for Indian beneficiaries. Chinese nationals, next in line, accounted for roughly 47,000 approvals, or just 12% of the total. While chances of this bill becoming law are slim, if passed it would impact Indians aspiring to work in the US.The bare details that are currently available on the official government website, provides for relevant amendments to the INA but there are no details available on transitional arrangements or exemptions for existing visa holders.The bill was immediately referred to several House committees, including ‘Judiciary, Energy and Commerce’, and ‘Ways and Means’, where it will face initial review.Greene, a Republican congresswoman from Georgia, has been a vocal critic of the H-1B system for years, consistently arguing that it undermines American workers by enabling companies, particularly in the tech sector, to recruit foreign labour at lower wage levels. In statements accompanying the bill’s introduction, she reiterated this stance, framing the legislation as a necessary step to protect US jobs and counter what she describes as “outsourcing and wage suppression. ”On social media, Greene highlighted her long-standing commitment to reshaping immigration policy, asserting that the H-1B program has too often been abused by corporations that put profits over people.Introduction of this bill comes at a tumultuous moment in her political career. Once one of the most visible allies of President Donald Trump, Greene has recently experienced a very public falling out with him over a series of disputes, including her support for bipartisan efforts to release files connected to the Jeffrey Epstein investigation. The discord culminated in Greene’s resignation from the House effective January 5.","Republican firebrand Marjorie Taylor Greene has introduced a bill in the House of Representatives seeking to terminate the H-1B visa program.

The US Citizenship and Immigration Services reminded new citizenship applicants that its neighborhood investigation before granting citizenship is back and not only neighbors but employers will also get visits by USCIS officials to verify moral character, assimilation into the US way of life etc.The neighbourhood investigation resumed in November 2025 as the agency overhauled the entire process of granting citizenship, putting America's protection at the top. ""The purpose of a neighborhood investigation is to verify aliens’ eligibility for naturalization by reviewing their residency, moral character, loyalty to the U.S. Constitution, and commitment to the nation’s well-being.

Background checking has been always a process before granting US citizenship but that did not mean officials would visit the neighborhood or speak to the neighbors as this was an old and discarded process after the administration started relying on more high-tech screening like running the name in FBI, DHS databases to check whether there is any criminal history etc.They also look for tax compliance, if there is any child support issue, fraud, violations etc.In 2025, the Donald Trump administration announced that they were bringing back the old neighborhood checks as the absence of criminal record is not enough to qualify for citizenship -- the involvement in the community, good moral character is what they are now looking for and neighbors would be able to vouch for that.The agency has also revised the naturalization test expanding the question bank from 100 to 128 questions; increased the number of questions on each test from 10 to 20; raised the passing score from 6 to 12 correct responses; and revised the questions to ensure the test provides a more meaningful assessment of the alien’s knowledge and understanding of US history and government.Naturalization is a privilege, and new citizens must understand the rights and responsibilities that come with this privilege, the administration said.","US Citizenship and Immigration Services reminded new citizenship applicants that its neighborhood investigation before granting citizenship is back.

UAE offers ‘citizenship’ to businesses under New Corporate Law 2026,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-offers-citizenship-to-businesses-under-new-corporate-law-2026/articleshow/126389470.cms,"Under new 2026 Law, UAE makes businesses ‘Emirati’ / Image: file

UAE Corporate Citizenship Law 2026

Who does it apply to?

How does it benefit companies?

Stronger Global Identity: Being officially recognised as a UAE company enhances credibility and trust in international markets.

Preferential Trade Access: It allows companies to benefit more easily from trade agreements the UAE has signed with other countries through Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreements (CEPAs). These deals can reduce tariffs and ease cross-border trade.

Local Incentives: Companies with Emirati status can qualify for incentives that local governments may offer to domestic entities, including support programs and sector initiatives.

Attract global business

Multiple Share Classes: Allowing flexibility in ownership structures for both LLCs and joint stock companies.

Re-domiciliation Flexibility: Companies can move registration between emirates or free zones without losing their legal identity.

Explicit Rules for Mergers & Acquisitions: Easier guidance for shareholder exits and corporate restructuring.

New Non-Profit Commercial Company Types: Businesses can now incorporate for non-profit commercial purposes.





The UAE has introduced an important update to its Commercial Companies Law that officially grants “citizenship” status to companies established in the country. This doesn’t mean that owners or investors become Emirati citizens, rather, the company itself gains recognition as a UAE company under the law.According to Abdulla bin Touq Al Marri, Minister of Economy and Tourism, this provision applies to businesses formed anywhere in the UAE, including both mainland and free-zone companies. That means entities based in financial free zones now also enjoy full Emirati corporate identity.Officials stress that this move aligns the UAE with global corporate practices: just as a business registered in Germany is regarded as a German company, firms in the UAE will be recognised as Emirati companies under this law.The first thing to clear up is a common misconception: this law does not grant individual UAE citizenship to the owners or shareholders of a company.As clarified by Abdulla bin Touq Al Marri, the UAE Minister of Economy, the ""nationality"" belongs strictly to the legal entity itself.Think of it like this: if you open a company in London, it is a British company.In the UAE, the new law formalizes this relationship, ensuring that any business established here, whether on the mainland or within a financial free zone like the DIFC or ADGM, is recognized globally as a UAE-national entity.This move aligns the Emirates with international standards and strengthens the ""Brand UAE"" label for every product and service exported from the country.A key point emphasised by authorities is that this corporate citizenship does not extend to individual shareholders, investors, or founders. It strictly refers to the legal status of the company itself, not personal citizenship for people.This clarification came after questions emerged about whether foreign owners could seek Emirati citizenship with this provision, the answer is no. The benefit applies to the business entity only.The rule includes all types of incorporated companies, whether they operate on the UAE mainland or within free and financial free zones. This broad eligibility was specifically underscored to avoid confusion.This legal recognition as a UAE company brings multiple practical benefits:By reinforcing national identity for companies, the UAE aims to help businesses scale internationally while maintaining strong links back to the UAE economy.The corporate citizenship provision is part of a larger overhaul of the UAE’s Commercial Companies Law (Federal Decree‐Law No. 20 of 2025), which also includes modernising company structures and governance frameworks.Other reforms in the new law include:These changes are intended to make the UAE one of the world’s most attractive destinations for business growth, innovation, and foreign investment.The UAE’s corporate landscape has grown rapidly in recent years, with hundreds of thousands of new businesses launched. This legal update is designed to support that growth by strengthening companies’ roots within the UAE and enhancing their global competitiveness.By being officially recognised as Emirati companies, UAE-based firms will find it easier to leverage trade agreements, secure investment, and compete internationally, helping reinforce the UAE’s reputation as a global business hub","The UAE has introduced an important update to its Commercial Companies Law.

Oksana Baiul's net worth: How the Olympian’s divorce settlement reshaped her finances,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/international-sports/oksana-baiuls-net-worth-how-the-olympians-divorce-settlement-reshaped-her-finances/articleshow/126401289.cms,"Oksana Baiul's net worth: How the Olympian’s divorce settlement reshaped her finances (Image via Getty)

How Oksana Baiul built her wealth through skating, media, and assets

What Is Oksana Baiul's Net Worth? - The Olympic Vault

How Oksana Baiul’s divorce settlement impacts her future finances





Oksana Baiul’s recent divorce settlement is the first look into how Baiul's financial situation has changed since her Olympic win. Official court documents show her net worth sits around $2 million and has changed to give her ex-husband, Carlo Farina, primary custody of their 11-year-old daughter, Sophia. This shift in decision-making brings up a number of questions surrounding Baiul's finances and raises the issue of how she will provide for her daughter while maintaining financial stability after her Olympic career ended.There are conflicting reports on what Oksana Baiul’s settlement included, but many US news outlets reported that, as part of the settlement, Baiul has maintained most of her personal assets; however, she has cut all ties to Farina financially through the divorce settlement. This is a significant change for Baiul, who has just gotten out of a professional competition and continues to build a professional career.With the new settlement, it appears Oksana Baiul has continued to hold onto many of the resources she had earned previously and will be able to have access to the cash and asset values that allow for continued financial security while maintaining custody of Sophia.Oksana Baiul’s income generated from NCAA success (winning a gold medal at Lillehammer) was mined primarily during the period PMT (Professional Moving Team) and PMTA (Professional Moving Transportation Industry) were in operation.During this time period, Baiul received a considerable amount of income from endorsements, appearances in professional figure skating competitions, and participation in television programming. Apart from this, the SAG AFTRA earnings and additional earnings from Baiul's participation in PMT and PMTA have added to Baiul's estimated total net worth of 2 million USD as of the time of this report.The terms of the divorce decreed that Oksana Baiul would retain her complete interests and rights to all of her SAG AFTRA earnings, along with a large quantity of items of high value, such as designer handbags, couture clothing, designer eyeglasses, and designer shoes. This clearly indicates that a significant portion of Baiul's estimated worth is not limited to her liquid assets but also consists of the high-value lifestyle items that Baiul has accumulated during her long career as a public figure.Oksana Baiul and Farina also agreed regarding the split of both of their investment and expense obligations. Baiul and Farina agreed to share in the control of an investment account totaling 108,000 USD. In turn, Farina agreed to absolve Baiul of an obligation to repay 194,000 USD (the amount previously loaned by Farina's business to Baiul). These actions resulted in a significant reduction of long-term financial liabilities for Baiul and will have an overall stabilizing effect on Baiul's financial portfolio.As part of the final settlement, Oksana Baiul will receive a lump-sum cash payment of $ 100,000 and an additional $150,000 over a period of five years, as well as a 2020 Mercedes as part of the agreement, once she has relocated to Nevada. Additionally, under the agreement, Oksana Baiul will receive $550,000 from the net proceeds of the sale of the former family home. The remaining balance of what is owed to both Oksana Baiul and her ex-husband will be split evenly. Additionally, it should be noted that Oksana Baiul will not be required to pay child support, and neither Oksana Baiul nor her ex-husband will receive spousal support.Oksana Baiul hints at the plans she’s going to do next. She has indicated that the limited job opportunities in Louisiana were a factor in her decision to leave Louisiana and move back to Las Vegas to pursue her career in professional skating and potentially work in media.Also Read: Olympic gold medalist forced to sell Louisiana home as financial struggles mount following recent personal setbacks","Oksana Baiul’s divorce settlement is the first look into how Baiul's financial situation has changed since her Olympic win.

The 2025 NFL offseason fundamentally reshaped the league’s financial hierarchy. Fueled by a historic salary cap jump and an aggressive contract market, several star players experienced massive year-over-year increases in net worth, not gradually but almost overnight.From record-breaking guaranteed money to transformative off-field deals, these players didn’t just get paid, they entered a new financial tier. Here are the five NFL stars whose net worth increased the most from 2024 to 2025, based on contract guarantees, endorsement expansion, and reported business ventures.Estimated net worth increase (2024–2025): $40–60 millionJosh Allen’s financial leap in 2025 was driven by one of the most significant contracts in NFL history. In March 2025, Allen signed a six-year, $330 million extension, including a record $250 million in guaranteed money.That guarantee alone dramatically reshaped his net worth profile compared to 2024. Beyond his contract, Allen also expanded his endorsement portfolio, including a reported equity stake with New Era, signaling a shift toward long-term brand ownership rather than traditional sponsorships.Allen’s 2025 offseason marked the moment he moved from “highly paid quarterback” to financial cornerstone of the league.Estimated net worth increase: $35–50 millionMicah Parsons’ rise from elite defender to financial heavyweight accelerated rapidly in 2025. Following his high-profile move to Green Bay, Parsons signed a four-year, $188 million contract with $136 million guaranteed, placing him among the highest-paid defensive players in NFL history.Compared to 2024, when Parsons was still operating under a comparatively modest rookie-deal framework, the guaranteed money alone represents a massive net worth swing. His deal also reset expectations for non-quarterback stars in future negotiations.Parsons’ 2025 jump underscores how defensive superstars are finally being paid at quarterback-adjacent levels.Estimated net worth increase: $45–55 millionFew financial transformations in NFL history compare to Brock Purdy’s. After entering the league as “Mr. Irrelevant,” Purdy signed a five-year, $265 million contract in March 2025, instantly changing his long-term financial outlook.In 2024, Purdy’s net worth was limited by his rookie-scale contract. By 2025, guaranteed money, signing bonuses, and endorsement momentum pushed him into elite earning territory.Purdy’s rise is a case study in how quarterback valuation once proven can redefine net worth in a single offseason.Estimated net worth increase: $25–40 millionUnlike others on this list, Travis Kelce’s biggest gains in 2025 were off the field. While his NFL earnings remained strong, Kelce’s financial explosion was driven by media and branding.His three-year, $156 million “New Heights” podcast deal with Amazon’s Wondery, combined with a surge in endorsements and investments, significantly elevated his wealth compared to 2024. Increased visibility and cultural relevance amplified Kelce’s earning power beyond traditional athlete pathways.Kelce’s 2025 growth highlights the expanding role of media, personality, and platform ownership in athlete wealth creation.Estimated net worth increase: $30–45 millionJa’Marr Chase reset the wide receiver market in March 2025 by signing a four-year, $161 million contract, including $112 million guaranteed, the highest guarantee ever for a receiver.In 2024, Chase was already one of the league’s top talents, but his new deal elevated him into a rare financial class for non-quarterbacks. The guaranteed money alone represents a dramatic net worth increase, even before endorsements and incentives are factored in.Chase’s deal reflects the NFL’s shifting economics, where elite pass catchers now command franchise-level financial commitment.The NFL salary cap jumped from $255.4 million in 2024 to $279.2 million in 2025, giving teams unprecedented flexibility to front-load guarantees and reset markets across positions.Unlike previous eras, 2025 contracts emphasized cash flow and guarantees, immediately impacting players’ net worth rather than spreading earnings over time.The biggest net worth increases from 2024 to 2025 weren’t just about playing well, they were about timing, leverage, and market evolution. Josh Allen, Micah Parsons, Brock Purdy, Travis Kelce, and Ja’Marr Chase all capitalized on a perfect storm of salary cap growth, positional value shifts, and off-field opportunity.Also read - Fans accuse Travis Kelce of money laundering as his foundation comes under scrutiny","The 2025 NFL offseason fundamentally reshaped the league’s financial hierarchy.

Investor concerns beyond Jeff Bezos







Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has once again cautioned that artificial intelligence is presently an ‘industrial bubble’, even he insisted that the technology itself is real and will ultimately deliver huge amounts of benefits to the society. Recently, speaking at the Italian Tech Week alongside Exor CEO John Elkann, Bezos said that the excitement around AI has led to unusual investor behaviour, with billions of dollars flowing into companies regardless strong fundamentals.Bezos explained that bubbles are characterised by inflated stock prices and a rush of funding into both good and bad ideas. This makes it difficult for the investor to distinguish.Bezos further outlined the hallmarks of bubbles. He said that the current AI climate as one where “every experiment or idea gets funded,” even if the fundamentals are weak. He pointed to unusual behavior such as small companies with only a handful of employees receiving billions of dollars in investment. This, he said, is a hallmark of industrial bubbles, where excitement drives capital into ventures indiscriminately.Despite this caution, Bezos feels that the technology itself is genuine and transformative. “AI is real, and it is going to change every industry,” he told the audience. He further compared the situation to the biotech bubble of the 1990s, which witnessed many companies fail but ultimately produced some life-saving drugs. Industrial bubbles, he argued, are not necessarily harmful; when the dust settles, society benefits from the inventions that survive.Bezos’ remarks echo a growing chorus of warnings from business leaders. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has previously said the AI market is in a bubble. At the same event in Turin, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon cautioned that investor excitement often overlooks risks, predicting a “reset” or “drawdown” in valuations. Similarly, Karim Moussalem, chief investment officer at Selwood Asset Management, recently said the AI trade is beginning to resemble “one of the great speculative manias of market history. ”","Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has once again cautioned that artificial intelligence is presently an ‘industrial bubble’ However, he insisted that the technology itself is real and will ultimately deliver huge amounts of benefits to the society.

Goyal explained his leadership style involves extended periods of coaching, but if no progress is made, he confronts the person directly.he noted.The situation reveals the challenges that can arise when successful startup founders join larger organisations through acquisitions and must adjust their working style to fit the new company's expectations.Describing what he calls aphase, Goyal said he sometimes purposely breaks down a leader's confidence to make them start fresh.he explained.According to Goyal, this method has worked most of the time.he added.However, Goyal did not confirm whether Dhindsa's job or duties officially changed during this time. Still, his comments show how intense the process was of bringing Blinkit into Eternal, especially as the company was growing both Blinkit and Zomato while facing more competition in quick commerce.Zomato bought Blinkit, which was previously known as Grofers, in 2022 for Rs 4,447 crore, or about $568 million at the time, in an all-stock deal. This marked Zomato's official entry into India's rapidly growing quick commerce business. Since buying the company, Blinkit has become a key growth area for Eternal, opening many new stores and handling more and more orders.","Deepinder Goyal, founder and CEO of Zomato's parent company Eternal, has revealed that he asked Albinder Dhindsa to step down from his role twice shortly after the acquisition of Blinkit. Goyal explained that this move was part of his tough leadership reset method.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126356319,imgsize-1499211,width-400,resizemode-4/zomato-parent-eternals-ceo-deepinder-goyal-asked-blinkit-ceo-albinder-dhindsa-to-step-down-twice-after-acquisition-heres-why.jpg"

MCX Gold is currently consolidating near its all-time high of 140,465. With prices rebounding from the lower end of the range, the current level within the consolidation is seen as a buying opportunity. A breakout above the recent highs is likely to reignite the bullish momentum. As long as prices stay above the breakout zone, the overall outlook for Gold continues to be bullish.From a technical stance, the 134,000 zone stands out as a strong support, representing the breakout above the prior swing high. Any pullback toward this level is likely to encourage fresh buying interest, helping to limit near-term downside. Sustaining above this support reinforces the bullish structure and keeps the positive momentum firmly in place.Gold is well positioned to move toward the 144,000 level in the coming sessions.This potential advance aligns with the broader bullish trend and highlights the strength of the prevailing market momentum. Moreover, a clear and sustained breakout above the intermediate resistance of the consolidation range could draw in additional buying interest, further strengthening positive sentiment and paving the way for an extended upward move.Overall, Gold is firmly positioned to sustain its positive bias, with the broader technical structure strongly supporting trend continuation. As long as prices hold above the critical 134,000 support, the bullish setup remains intact. With momentum indicators and overall market sentiment continuing to stay supportive, the precious metal appears well poised for further upside in the coming sessions.MCX Silver has marked a fresh all-time high this week, with prices consistently forming higher highs over the past several months. Despite the recent pullback, the overall bias remains positive, and any declines toward the lower end of the weekly range are likely to present buying opportunities. We recommend trading in line with the existing trend, which remains firmly bullish.Silver’s rebound from the support level highlights renewed strength in the trend and increases the likelihood of further upside. As long as prices remain above the weekly support levels, the bullish bias is expected to stay intact. The immediate key support is placed near the 231,000 level, which now serves as a strong base. Any pullback toward this area is likely to attract fresh buying interest, helping to stabilize prices and sustain the upward momentum.On the upside, Silver is strongly positioned to challenge the 275,000 resistance over the near to medium term. This anticipated move marks a continuation of the prior bullish phase and is firmly supported by robust market momentum and favourable technical indicators. Overall, as long as prices remain comfortably above the 231,000 support, Silver is expected to sustain its positive trajectory, with ample scope for further upside as bullish sentiment continues to build.","Gold and silver prices are touching new record highs and this is a phase of consolidation, says Abhilash Koikkara, Head - Forex & Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Gurgaon to slap FIRs against those driving wrong side,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/gurgaon-to-slap-firs-against-those-driving-wrong-side/articleshow/126406245.cms,"Representative Image

TIMES VIEW







GURGAON: City police have decided to get tougher on wrong-side driving, deciding to file FIRs against motorists found moving against the traffic, particularly on highways and major arterial roads.Police officials said criminal cases in such matters were earlier registered only in rare and exceptional circumstances. But with wrongside driving emerging as oneof the leading causes of accidents in the city, FIRs will now be lodged in a more “rigid and consistent manner” under BNS sections involving rash driving , causing death by negligence and as the situation may warrant.As per police data, as many as 2 lakh vehicles were challaned for wrong-side driving in the city through 2025.Traffic police officials admitted that merely issuing challans was not enough to deter habitual offenders. “Despite regular enforcement drives, barricading and awareness campaigns, the high number of violations on roads suggests that the problem is widespread. This prompted the stricter enforcement strategy of getting FIRs registered against offenders,” a police official said.According to police sources, the FIRs will be registered mostly in cases of repeat offenders.“But in case anyone is found driving on the wrong side on highways, expressways or key arterial roads, an FIR can be registered against a first-time offender too,” the official said.The wider traffic violation data for 2025 underlined the scale of indiscipline on the city’s roads. During the year, 1.1 lakh cases of speeding were recorded, while 1.9 lakh motorists were fined for wrong-side parking. Sudden lane changing led to 79,615 challans.Police also issued 3.9 lakh challans for riding without a helmet and lodged 4.5 lakh cases of triple riding or pillion violations. In addition, 5,812 drivers were challaned for using mobile phoneswhile driving, which, police said, was another emerging reason for accidents.Police said these were not isolated lapses, but repeated, everyday violations that created conflict points on fastmoving roads, raised the risk of accidents and left little room for error for other motorists and pedestrians.A comparison with 2024 figures showed a sharp rise in several categories. In 2024, the city police fined 1.8 lakh drivers for wrong-side driving, 18,444 for speeding, 1.6 lakh for wrong-side parking, and 61,780 for unsafe lane changing. That year also saw 2.3 lakh cases of riding without a helmet, 2.6 lakh pillion riding violations, and 4,297 cases of mobile phone use while driving.Police said the jump in violations, especially wrongside driving and helmetless riding, reinforced the view that stronger deterrentswere required.“The objective is to send a clear message that traffic violations threatening public safety will no longer be tolerated. Violators on high-speed corridors will face criminal action under relevant legal provisions. The enforcement will be closely monitored by the traffic department, with special focus on repeat offenders and cases where lives were clearly put at risk,” the official said.Asked about sections such FIRs would involve, the official said, “It will obviously depend on the circumstances. By and large, they may include sections 281 (rash or negligent driving endangering life) 121 (voluntarily causing hurt to a public servant or deterring them from duty and so on.”Apart from enforcement, cops have been carrying out traffic awareness programmes across the city, holding workshops and interactions with truck and bus drivers, school transport operators, auto-rickshaw and corporate drivers to stress on the dangers of wrong-side driving and the importance of lane discipline.On Friday, DCP (traffic) Rajesh Mohan inspected key traffic points, including the Manesar-Bilaspur-Rathiwas stretch, and issued directions for immediate pothole repairs, improved barricading, better deployment of traffic marshals, upgraded service lanes and clearer signage, along with safe pedestrian crossings.Police said such inspections would continue regularly and appealed to residents to cooperate by following traffic rules responsibly.Wrong-side driving is potentially a life-threatening traffic violation. In the past, challans have been issued by cops to little effect. Gurgaon Police’s decision to file FIRs against such errant drivers will certainly raise the deterrence level. Cops in other parts of NCR should follow suit. However, a long-term solution lies only in putting a smart electronic system in place. Which would ensure that traffic rule violators in any form don't go unpunished.",Wrong-side driving is one of the leading causes of accidents in Gurgaon. FIRs will be lodged in a more ‘rigid and consistent manner’ under BNS sections involving rash driving. As many as 2 lakh vehicles were challaned for wrong- side driving in the city through 2025.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126406241,imgsize-73380,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/wrong-side-driving-now-invites-firs.jpg"

Saudi Arabia is stepping up efforts to increase local workforce participation in specialized jobs. The Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development has unveiled two major decisions that set higher saudization targets and introduce minimum wage standards, aiming to create better opportunities for citizens in vital sectors.Saudization, or “Nitaqat,” is a national policy designed to increase the employment of Saudi citizens across public and private sectors. Its goal is to reduce reliance on expatriate labor and ensure that Saudi nationals are well-represented in key professions. The policy sets specific targets for businesses, requiring them to employ a certain percentage of Saudi workers depending on industry and role. Compliance is monitored by the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development, with guidance provided on calculation methods, required documentation, and enforcement procedures.Under the first decision, Saudization in engineering professions will rise to 30 percent. This change targets companies with five or more employees working in 46 specialized roles, including:A new minimum wage of SAR 8,000 will apply to Saudi engineers in both private and non-profit sectors. To qualify, professionals must hold accreditation from the Saudi Council of Engineers.The decision took effect on December 31, 2025, but companies will have six months to prepare before full enforcement.This preparation period allows businesses to adjust hiring practices, ensure proper accreditation, and align with Saudization requirements.The ministry has highlighted that the move will not only increase Saudi participation but also improve the work environment by fostering skilled, certified professionals in the sector.The second decision focuses on procurement roles in the private sector, setting a saudization target of 70 percent. This applies to establishments employing three or more workers in 12 key procurement positions, such as:This regulation comes into effect on November 30, 2025, with a six-month grace period to allow companies time to meet the new requirements.The ministry emphasized that increasing Saudi participation in procurement will strengthen national engagement in critical business operations, expand job opportunities for citizens, and enhance overall productivity within the sector.To guide businesses through the transition, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development has published a procedural guide on its website. The guide provides:Companies are urged to follow the guidelines carefully. Failure to meet the new targets may result in penalties, reinforcing the government’s commitment to building a more locally-driven workforce.The ministry described these important measures as part of a strategic step toward boosting employment opportunities for Saudis, improving workplace standards, and strengthening national participation in vital economic sectors.","Saudization, or “Nitaqat,” is a national policy designed to increase the employment of Saudi citizens across public and private sectors.

No Hajj Visa Without It: Egypt Introduces Mandatory Health Rule for 2026 Pilgrims

Bottom line





Ahead of the 1447 AH/2026 Hajj season, the Egyptian government has announced that it will stop providing state-funded free pilgrimage slots. Instead, it will use electronic lottery systems and licensed paid pilgrimage packages. This is a significant change for millions of potential pilgrims and indicates reforms in Egypt’s public spending and Hajj logistics before the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia ’s upcoming Hajj season.Egypt’s Ministry of Social Solidarity and the National Foundation for Facilitating Hajj announced the results of the public electronic Hajj lottery for 2026 pilgrims, selecting approximately 12,000 applicants from across Egyptian governorates through a fully digital draw aimed at promoting transparency. Successful applicants must now pay for their pilgrimage arrangements through official channels.The confirmation of the lottery result was done through a press conference by Minister Maya Morsi. This highlights the fact that the lottery has currently become the main means for Egyptians, as opposed to a subsidized state sponsorship, for Egyptian Hajj visas.This is part of a bigger trend that has been underway for the past few years.During economic strains in 2022 and 2023, Egypt cancelled Hajj at state expense for the second consecutive year, opting not to use government resources to underwrite pilgrimages amid budgetary pressures.Separately, the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities opened Hajj registration via licensed tourism companies for the 2026 season, with applications accepted from mid-October and results published in early November. These packages are presented in economy, mid-range and premier options. They are fully paid pilgrim services, requiring applicants to cover costs ranging from accommodation to transport, managed through officially accredited tour operators.Government data showed that tourism Hajj packages this year were priced across categories to accommodate different budgets and that the ministry even reduced some prices slightly compared to the previous season to ease financial burdens. Here's what this means for Egyptian pilgrims -In addition to changes in government support and lottery systems for the Hajj 2026, Egyptian authorities have made it clear that Muslims going for Hajj must submit certain requirements regarding visas and health documents. The Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities has confirmed that pilgrims are required to present a “Health Fitness Certificate” before they can be given a Hajj visa. The health certificate is a medical document that verifies the pilgrims’ ability to carry out the Hajj rituals.All other official registration formalities have been conducted through the designated channels. The move is a part of the general procedural updates being undertaken to ensure that this is done in an orderly manner and in line with the rules established by the Saudi government, relating to visas as well as safety regulations among the crowds attendant at the annual pilgrimage. Notably, the process of visa application for tourism category Hajj pilgrims is put on hold until this certificate is submitted.Hajj is one of Islam’s five pillars and essential for Muslims who can afford it but rising costs and economic reforms have made traditional free or subsidised government sponsorships less viable. Egypt’s updated model meets the rising demand and Saudi Arabia ’s logistical changes for managing the annual pilgrimage. It prioritises transparency, fairness and controlled access through digital lotteries and regulated tourism channels.For potential pilgrims and their families, the message is clear. Hajj in 2026 will rely on paid, structured packages and lottery allocations instead of blanket government sponsorship. This approach sets a new standard for one of the largest religious migrations on Earth.","Egypt is relying heavily on a digital lottery system where names are selected at random from millions of applicants.
