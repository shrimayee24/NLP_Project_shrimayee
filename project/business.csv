What is an Atomic Clock?

What are the benefits of the project?

How will the transition happen?

NEW DELHI: The country may be on Indian Standard Time (IST), but the exact time is determined by GPS satellites , down to the millisecond, and is linked to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).In the next few months this is set to change with Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC) being the link to National Physical Laboratory to provide the reference time. A lab in Faridabad will receive the time from NavIC which will be shared through an optic fibre link with four other centres - Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Bhubaneswar and Guwahati - with each having an atomic clock .The deployment of atomic clocks will ensure the time shown on digital watches, smartphones and laptops is based on the atomic clocks instead of service providers accessing data from multiple sources linked to GPS. Soon, the regional centres will disseminate the time to all end users - resulting in ""one nation, one time"".The satellite system was conceived soon after the Kargil war, when India could not get the exact location of targets from foreign satellites. Govt realised that strategic importance and finally got moving on the project around seven years ago.Consumer affairs secretary Nidhi Khare said most of the work for the Times Dissemination Project has been completed with atomic clocks installed in Faridabad, Ahmedabad, Bengaluru and Bhubaneswar. A few months ago, the NavIC link with NPL Faridabad was tested. The department, which is working with NPL and Isro to disseminate IST with millisecond to microsecond accuracy, will have to align the clocks in four centres with Faridabad to adjust for the time taken for sharing the data through the optic fibre cable.An atomic clock is a clock known for its exceptional accuracy, and functions by utilising specific resonance frequencies of atoms. The extreme precision levels of the atomic clocks can be interpreted by the fact that they will lose one second every 100 million years or so.Former consumer affairs secretary Rohit Kumar Singh said it will establish India's own precise and reliable time distribution network, reducing dependence on foreign systems and enhancing national security. ""It will benefit critical sectors like power grids, telecommunications, banking, defence, and transportation by ensuring synchronised operations, efficiency, and resilience against cyber threats,"" he said.While technical work is underway, the consumer affairs department has notified the draft rules, mandating the use of IST as the sole time reference for legal, administrative, commercial, and official documents across the country.Exceptions will be allowed for specialised fields such as astronomy, navigation, and scientific research, subject to prior govt approval with violations attracting penalty.","Atomic clocks will ensure the time shown on digital watches, smartphones and laptops is based on the atomic clocks.

Waqf bill joint parliament panel to formally adopt tweaks tomorrow,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/waqf-bill-joint-parliament-panel-to-formally-adopt-tweaks-tomorrow/articleshow/117615254.cms,"Waqf bill joint parliament panel to formally adopt tweaks tomorrow

NEW DELHI: Brushing aside opposition's protests and amid accusations of interference in religious affairs of Muslims, BJP and its allies on JPC Monday cleared key changes to Waqf Act, clearing the way for the end of ""waqf by user"" scheme, where properties are deemed to be a Muslim religious charity only on the basis of the word's current usage.If the bill incorporating the changes recommended by the JPC are approved, all waqf claims will have to be backed by registered deeds.The proposed changes, such as inclusion of two non-Muslims, excluding officials who may be there by virtue of their positions, in Central Waqf Council, seek to overhaul the administration of waqf properties worth hundreds of billions of rupees.The JPC adopted all 32 amendments proposed by NDA, while turning down all suggested by opposition by a vote. Congress, TMC, DMK and AIMIM are expected to register their dissent.The JPC has called for the inclusion of up to four non-Muslims in state waqf boards. It also adopted an amendment to take minority Muslim sects like Dawoodi Bohras and Agakhanis out of the jurisdiction of waqf boards, mostly Sunni-controlled bodies.Another crucial amendment as per sources is that a person claiming to be a Muslim and wanting to donate his assets to waqf needs to produce evidence to show that he has been practising the faith for at least five years. The changes are going to be formally adopted by by JPC at its meeting Wednesday to complete the procedural requirement for the bill to be referred back to Parliament and for govt to draw the time-table to seek its passage. Sources in govt said they were ready to move.The outcome, marked by protests by opposition, was significant because of the steadfast support of BJP's allies JDU, TDP and Lok Janshakti Party which have often been sensitive to concerns of their Muslim constituents. The unity in the ruling bloc augurs well for the passage of the bill in the two Houses.Govt has justified the proposed changes by saying they were necessary to tackle the misuse of ""waqf by user"" provision, check corruption in waqf bodies and for making them more inclusive. Another amendment adopted by the panel proposes to do away with vesting any inquiry into disputes over a govt property with the district collector and making room for the state govt to designate an officer above the rank of collector to carry out the inquiry.It is also proposed to allow waqf boards to decide on welfare measures for widows and orphans, among others, instead of mandating it by law. Meanwhile, JPC chairman Jagdambika Pal rejected the opposition's charges, claiming the entire exercise was democratic and the majority view prevailed.","The JPC adopted all 32 amendments proposed by NDA, while turning down all suggested by opposition by a vote.

When and where to watch in India?

Skywatchers are in for a celestial treat as six planets—Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—align in a rare astronomical phenomenon. This spectacular display will be visible from January 21 to January 31.An official told the news agency PTI, that Mars, Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn will be visible to the naked eye, creating a stunning formation in the evening sky.The official explained that while Mars, Venus, Jupiter and Saturn will create a visible spectacle observable without equipment, viewing Neptune and Uranus will require optical aids such as binoculars or telescopes.Parade of planets is a phrase people use when two or more planets are visible in the night sky. However, Nasa has specified that it is not an astronomical term. So why is the term is used?The presence of bright planets like Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and Venus in a single viewing makes this particular event particularly rare and distinctive. Jupiter shines brightly, while Venus and Mars are reaching their peak brilliance in the post-sunset sky for the first time in years.With Saturn still prominently visible and Mercury making occasional appearances, four or five planets can easily be spotted with the naked eye, creating a captivating celestial spectacle.Space.com explains that all planets in our solar system follow orbital paths around the sun along a specific plane known as the ecliptic. This results in planets appearing in a linear formation when viewed from Earth. Although these linear arrangements are regular occurrences in our sky, they are typically classified as planetary alignments.In India, astronomers across India have prepared for events where people can witness the planets. However, if one can’t attend an organized session, several apps can guide you in exploring the night sky on your own.The Tamil Nadu Science and Technology Centre (TNSTC) had organised a special night sky observation for the public at Periyar Science and Technology Centre in Kottupuram from Jan 22 to 25 (from 6pm to 8pm).""You can see Venus, Jupiter, Saturn and Mars from your terrace or from the beach. Mars will rise around 9pm,"" said I K Lenin Tamilkovan, executive director, TNSTC.The Department of Science and Technology's Pathani Samanta Planetarium in Bhubaneswar has established suitable facilities to accommodate astronomy enthusiasts for this event.The official confirmed that visitors can observe this uncommon phenomenon daily between 5.30 pm and 7.30 pm.","Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune will align in a rare astronomical phenomenon.

What is UCC and what is its significance??

UCC criticism

What is the implementation process?

NEW DELHI: Uttarakhand is set to make history on Monday by becoming the first state in post-independence India to implement the Uniform Civil Code (UCC). Chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami will officially launch the UCC portal and issue a notification marking the adoption of the civil code, following the completion of government employee training, mock drills, and dry-run sessions.""The UCC's implementation represents a significant milestone, making the Himalayan state the first in the country to adopt this progressive legislation since independence,"" Dhami said.CM Dhami said that the UCC was drafted after extensive consultations with experts, locals, and representatives from various communities, with the goal of bringing uniformity in society and empowering women.The UCC addresses various societal issues, including marriage, divorce, inheritance, and live-in relationships. Key aspects of the law include the registration of marriages, divorces, and live-in relationships to ensure equal property rights and protect children's rights, with penalties for non-compliance.UCC is a set of laws that aims to standardise personal laws across religions. The move has sparked both support and criticism, with proponents arguing for equality and opponents warning of potential societal divisions.The UCC clarifies legal requirements for marriage, stating that only mentally capable individuals aged 21 (for men) or 18 (for women) who are not already married may enter into a union. Marriages can be performed according to religious customs, but registration will be mandatory to ensure legal recognition.The law also addresses issues related to the creation and cancellation of wills and codicils under testamentary succession. Marriages solemnized before March 26, 2010, or those outside the state will be eligible for registration if legal requirements are met.Opposition leaders have criticized the UCC, arguing that it may lead to societal division along religious lines and might be impractical and overly ambitious.The debate surrounding the UCC extends beyond Uttarakhand, as Article 44 of the Indian Constitution advocates for a uniform civil code across the country. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has referenced the Supreme Court's direction on the need for a common code, stressing that fulfilling the vision of the Constitution's framers remains a national goal.Uttarakhand's implementation of the UCC is likely to set a precedent, with other states potentially following suit. The success of the law's implementation will depend on its ability to balance individual rights and social harmony.As Uttarakhand stands at the forefront of this legal revolution, the coming weeks will offer a clearer picture of how the UCC will be received, both in the state and across India. The state's experience with the UCC will undoubtedly shape the future of personal law reform in the country.Shailesh Bagauli, secretary (home), stated that the government will issue two notifications: one for the implementation of the UCC and another for the rules and regulations, officially launching the UCC in the state.Dhami had promised to implement the UCC if re-elected during the 2022 state polls. After becoming CM, he appointed a five-member committee led by Justice Ranjana Prakash Desai to draft the code, which received feedback from over 2.3 lakh people, representing nearly 10% of Uttarakhand's families.The 740-page draft was presented to the chief minister on February 2, 2024, approved by the cabinet on February 4, tabled in the assembly on February 6, and passed the following day. Governor Lt Gen Gurmit Singh (retd) approved the bill on February 28 and President Droupadi Murmu subsequently signed it on March 11.","UCC is a set of laws that aims to standardise personal laws across religions.

Amid concerns in India about Trump’s threat to hike tariffs on imports from India and elsewhere, as also possible friction over illegal immigration, Modi said in a post on X that both sides are committed to a mutually beneficial and trusted partnership.This was Modi’s first conversation with “my dear friend” Trump since the latter’s inauguration on January 20. While ties with the US in areas like defence, technology, counterterrorism, energy and space are expected to flourish further during the second Trump administration, fears remain about Trump’s possibly disruptive trade policies and his mass deportation threats.According to the White House, Trump emphasized the importance of India increasing its procurement of American-made security equipment and moving toward a “fair bilateral trading relationship”. “The leaders discussed plans for Prime Minister Modi to visit the White House, underscoring the strength of the friendship and strategic ties between our nations,” said the White House readout.“Delighted to speak with my dear friend President Donald Trump. Congratulated him on his historic second term. We are committed to a mutually beneficial and trusted partnership. We will work together for the welfare of our people and towards global peace, prosperity and security,’’ said Modi in a post on X on Monday evening.Modi and Trump discussed various facets of the wide-ranging bilateral Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership and measures to advance it, including in the areas of technology, trade, investment, energy and defence, said the Indian government in a readout. The two leaders exchanged views on global issues, including the situation in West Asia and Ukraine and agreed to meet soon.The conversation came ahead of a possible meeting between the 2 leaders on the margins of the AI summit that France will host next month. Trump has been invited for the summit and Modi has already confirmed his participation. India and the US are also in touch diplomatically for a bilateral visit by Modi to the US in the next few months, well before Trump travels to India for the Quad summit later this year.It also followed external affairs minister S Jaishankar’s meeting with his counterpart Marco Rubio in which the former raised issues related to delay in issuance of US visas to Indian nationals and Rubio brought up irregular migration from India. While India is open to taking back illegal migrants, as it was with the Biden administration and even earlier with the first Trump presidency, it wants enough time to be able to first verify the Indian origin of 18,000 illegals that US authorities have identified for deportation to India. While the Indian government wants to work with US authorities to address the issue, it has distanced itself from the number saying any discussion on numbers will be premature at this stage. For the US, India remains one of the largest sources of illegal immigration outside of Latin America.","PM Narendra Modi spoke to US President Donald Trump Monday.

NEW DELHI: A CBI court in Chandigarh sentenced Himachal Pradesh inspector general (IG) of Police Zahur Haider Zaidi and seven other police personnel to life imprisonment on Monday.

The post-mortem confirmed that she had been raped and murdered, leading to a case being filed.A Special Investigation Team (SIT), headed by Zaidi, was formed by the state government to investigate the case. The SIT arrested six people, including Suraj, who died in police custody. The police had initially registered an FIR against another accused, Rajinder, in the girl’s murder.The Himachal Pradesh high court later transferred both cases to the CBI for further investigation. After an inquiry, the CBI arrested Zaidi, Joshi, and the other police officers involved in Suraj’s custodial death.The CBI chargesheeted the accused officials for various offenses, including criminal conspiracy, murder, fabrication of false evidence, and torture during custody to extract a confession.In May 2019, the Supreme Court transferred the case related to the custodial death from Shimla to Chandigarh.The court also acquitted the then Superintendent of Police, DW Negi, in connection with the case.",Zahur Haider Zaidi and seven other police personnel sentenced to life imprisonment. The sentence follows their involvement in the custodial death of an accused in the rape and murder of a 16-year-old schoolgirl in Shimla's Kotkhai in 2017.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117605699,imgsize-717036,width-400,resizemode-4/117605699.jpg"

After the resumption of bilateral visits , India and China Monday took significant “people-centric” measures to normalise ties as they agreed to resume the Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage in 2025 and also consented, in principle, to restart direct flights between the 2 countries. While India wanted the pilgrimage, which has remained suspended since 2020, to resume, resumption of air services had been a longstanding Chinese demand.The announcement by India followed foreign secretary Vikram Misri’s visit to Beijing during which he also called on foreign minister Wang Yi, kick-starting what promises to be a series of substantive bilateral engagements that could culminate potentially in a visit to China by PM Narendra Modi for the SCO summit.The 2 sides agreed to resume existing dialogue mechanisms step-by-step, addressing each other’s concerns and priorities. Specific concerns in economic ties like the trade deficit were discussed with a view to resolving these issues and promoting “long-term policy transparency and predictability”.The 2 countries also agreed to hold an early meeting of the India-China Expert Level Mechanism to discuss resumption of provision of hydrological data and other cooperation pertaining to trans-border rivers, said the Indian readout. This follows concerns expressed in India about the possible impact of a mega Chinese hydropower project in the lower reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo river on the flow of water to lower riparian states.“The two sides recognize that 2025, being the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between India and China, should be utilized to redouble public diplomacy efforts to create better awareness about each other and restore mutual trust and confidence among the public,’’ said the Indian government in an official statement on Misri’s visit, adding the the 2 sides will conduct a number of commemorative activities to mark this anniversary. There was no mention of the border issue in the Indian statement on the outcomes of the visit, which followed NSA Ajit Doval’s visit to Beijing last month for border talks.In the meeting with Wang, while Misri committed India’s full support for China’s SCO rotating presidency, Wang called for more substantive measures to promote mutual trust and understanding. China will host the summit of the Eurasian group later this year.“The two countries should refrain from mutual suspicion, mutual estrangement, and mutual exhaustion,’’ said Wang, according to an English translation by CGTN of a Chinese readout.According to Indian authorities, India and China also agreed to take “appropriate measures” to further promote and facilitate people-to-people exchanges, including media and think-tank interactions. “They agreed in principle to resume direct air services between the two countries; the relevant technical authorities on the two sides will meet and negotiate an updated framework for this purpose at an early date,’’ said the Indian government.Wang said the recent improvement in China-India relations fully aligned with the fundamental interests of both countries and their peoples and was conducive to safeguarding the “legitimate rights and interests of the Global South countries”.It also helps to contribute to peace, stability, and prosperity in Asia and the world, he added.According to the Chinese readout, Misri said the 2 countries have engaged in a series of beneficial dialogues and communications, properly managed and resolved differences, and promoted the resumption of practical cooperation in various fields.The Indian government said that as agreed between PM Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping at their meeting in Kazan in October, the 2 sides reviewed the state of India-China bilateral relations comprehensively during Misri’s visit and agreed to take certain people-centric steps to stabilize and rebuild ties.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday spoke to US President Donald Trump over the phone, which also marked the first conversation between both leaders since Trump assumed office in the White House.During the call, PM Modi congratulated Trump on his historic victory in the US presidential elections.""Delighted to speak with my dear friend President Donald Trump. Congratulated him on his historic second term. We are committed to a mutually beneficial and trusted partnership. We will work together for the welfare of our people and towards global peace, prosperity, and security,"" PM Modi wrote on X.This was the second telephonic conversation between PM Modi and Donald Trump after his victory. The first was on November 6, immediately after Trump's victory.Talks between both leaders took place amid growing discussions over the issue of immigration and trade rules in the US, which were Trump's key poll plank in the parliamentary polls.The Trump administration is expected to implement US-focused trade measures, requiring India to lower trade restrictions or risk increased tariffs, which subsequently would affect Indian industries including IT, pharmaceuticals and textiles that are major exported to the US market.A few days ago, Trump threatened Brics nations, including India, of imposing 100 per cent tariffs on trade in case the bloc moves forward with plans to replace the US dollar.External affairs minister S Jaishankar, however, affirmed India's stance regarding the replacement of dollar, stating that the country has never supported de-dollarisation and there were no plans for a Brics currency.On immigration, the US President has expressed a balanced view on H-1B visa programme during a joint news conference at the White House with Oracle CTO Larry Ellison, Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son, and Open AI CEO Sam Altman.Amid concerns raised by the US over irregular migration, India has reiterated it will, like in the past, accept illegal migrants from the US only after verifying their Indian origin and that any talk about number of such undocumented people it’s willing to take back is “premature”.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to US President Donald Trump over the phone.

No, It’s a Isolated Incident Yes, It Needs Immediate Attention

GBS treatment very expensive, each injection costs Rs 20,000

Ajit Pawar announces free treatment for GBS

PUNE: The Maharashtra health department reported Sunday what is suspected to be the first death linked to the Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) outbreak concentrated in Pune as the caseload spiked to 101 with 28 more confirmed infections, based on updated surveillance data, reports Steffy Thevar. The daily bulletin said the suspected GBS death occurred in Solapur but did not give details.Sixteen of the patients diagnosed with this rare but treatable condition are currently on ventilator support. Around 19 of those with symptoms are below nine, while the 50-80 age group accounts for 23 cases.A patient hospitalised on Jan 9 is suspected to be the first GBS case within the Pune cluster. Tests have revealed the Campylobacter jejuni bacteria in some biological samples drawn from hospitalised patients. C Jejuni causes about a third of all GBS cases worldwide and is also responsible for the most severe infections.Authorities are sampling Pune's water, especially in areas that are reporting cases. Test results released Saturday showed that a well near Khadakwasla Dam, Pune's main water reservoir, had high levels of the bacterium E. coli. But officials said it was unclear if the well was being used at all. Residents have been advised to boil water and heat their food before consumption.Health department officials said 25,578 homes had been surveyed till Sunday as part of a surveillance exercise meant to find more patients within the community and pinpoint the trigger for the surge in GBS cases, which otherwise don’t exceed more than two a month.GBS occurs when the body’s immune system, while reacting to a bacterial or viral infection, mistakenly attacks the nerves that carry brain signals to parts of the body, leading to weakness, paralysis or other symptoms. Doctors said 80% of affected patients regain their ability to walk without assistance within six months of hospital discharge, but some may take up to a year or more to regain full use of their limbs. GBS treatment is also very expensive.Patients will typically need a course of immunoglobulin (IVIG) injections. A family TOI spoke to earlier said their 68-year-old relative, who was admitted on Jan 16, needed an IVIG course of 13 injections, with each shot costing about Rs 20,000.Three major hospitals in the city sent out alerts to local health authorities earlier this week after they found a higher-than-usual number of GBS patients —26 on Jan 10 — among newly admitted patients. By Friday, the number soared to 73.Speaking about rising cases in Pune, Maharashtra deputy CM Ajit Pawar announced, “The treatment is expensive. After discussions with officials from the district administration and municipal corporation, we have decided to provide free treatment. Those from Pimpri-Chinchwad will be treated at YCM Hospital, while patients from Pune Municipal Corporation areas will receive treatment at Kamla Nehru Hospital. For citizens from rural areas, free treatment will be provided at Sassoon Hospital in Pune.”",Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) cases in Pune have spiked to 101 with 28 more confirmed infections. 16 of the patients diagnosed with this rare but treatable condition are currently on ventilator support.

No threat to availability due to US curbs on Russian oil: IOC chief,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-threat-to-availability-due-to-us-curbs-on-russian-oil-ioc-chief/articleshow/117610353.cms,"IndianOil chairman Arvinder Singh Sahney

NEW DELHI: The disruption in Russian oil exports caused by the latest US sanctions will have no impact on India’s energy security in terms of supply as a diversified procurement matrix and technical flexibility allows Indian refineries to tap multiple alternatives, Arvinder Singh Sahney , chairman of India’s largest refiner and fuel retailer IndianOil told TOI on Monday.“We are still understanding how things will pan out. But we are very confident that it (sanctions) will not have any impact on crude availability for Indian refineries. I can speak for all of them, even private (sector),” Sahney said in what is the first public comment on the issue by an Indian oil company chief.Besides Russia, India, he said, buys crude from multiple sources — the Gulf, Africa, the Americas, OPEC and non-OPEC producers. New sources such as Brazil and Guyana are also emerging. “We have a wide range of contracts and alliances with all of them. So, we are not worried about supply.”Sahney’s confidence could also stem from the fact that the latest curbs impact roughly 15% of Russian oil exports, mostly sweet ESPO grade crude produced in the north and the Far-East and 183 of the 600 vessels in the Russian tanker fleet. Besides, there is no sanction on Rosneft, the largest Russian oil producer.He played down the impact on global oil prices , saying his understanding is they will be in the $75-80 per barrel this year.The company posted a net profit of Rs 2,873.5 crore in the December quarter, marking a 64% drop from Rs 8,063.6 crore in the previous corresponding quarter as inventory and foreign exchange losses eroded benefit of highest-ever sales and strong physical performance.On the Trump administration’s plan to pump up oil and gas production, Sahney said it will boost supply and expand options in the market for Indian refiners. Whether that will lead to a pivot towards the US will depend on competitiveness of US prices. “As our government has indicated, India is willing to buy energy from whoever offers the most competitive price.”IndianOil is not “particularly” looking for Russian crude from the spot market “at the moment”, Sahney said. This could reduce the share of Russian crude processed at its refineries from 30-35% before January 10, when the sanctions were imposed. “We are being very cautious,” he said since the latest sanctions have targeted the Russian oil export chain — oilfield service providers, tankers and insurers — besides producers. Buyers can face sanctions for violation at any one of these stages.","Arvinder Singh Sahney, chairman of India’s largest refiner and fuel retailer IndianOil told TOI on Monday. “We are very confident that it (sanctions) will not have any impact on crude availability for Indian refineries.

'Why does he want it?' EC over blocking public access of CCTV footage of poll booths



NEW DELHI: Election Commission of India on Tuesday addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll and said that the allegations regarding the rigging Electronic Voting Machines were ""baseless.""Setting a poetic tone, the chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar began with a shayari: ""All questions hold importance; answers must follow; out of habit, we kept giving written replies, but today, face-to-face feels necessary; who knows if tomorrow will come or not, today, an answer is due).""The CEC, before announcing the dates of Delhi assembly elections, took the opportunity to offer clarifications on allegations, including EVM tampering , erratic changes in voter list and recent changes in rules by the poll body to prevent public inspection of certain electronic documents.Kumar refuted claims of manipulation in the electoral roll, categorically mentioning that no deletion is made without proper documentation, field verification, and providing the individual an opportunity to be heard.On addition of names to the electoral roll, Kumar said, ""Regular meetings are held with the representatives of political parties, who have the right to appoint booth-level agents (BLAs). Weekly lists of claims and objections are shared, and both draft and final rolls are published on the Election Commission's website. Polling station rationalisation is also carried out with the consultation of all the stakeholders.""Regarding deletion of names from the list, he said, ""Mandatory field verification is conducted by the BLOs, and in cases where deletions exceed 2 per cent of a polling station's voter list, cross-verification is done. Deletions due to death require a certified death certificate, and a seven-day window is provided for objections after notices are published online. Also, the affected voters are given the opportunity for a personal hearing before their names are removed.""""Where every vote matters, raising doubts about deletion of thousands of names without evidence is misleading. The processes we follow leave no room for manipulation,"" he said.He added that political parties were involved at each and every stage of voter list preparation with full disclosure and opportunity to object.CEC said that it was not possible to change the voter turnout and said that it was ""misleading to compare final VTR with 5pm data.""""...It is impossible to change voter turnout...Some polling parties report at midnight or the next day.

There is no question of invalid votes in the EVM. No rigging is possible. High courts and the Supreme Court are continuously saying this in different judgments... What else can be said? EVMs are foolproof devices for counting. Allegations of tampering are baseless. We are speaking now because we don't speak when elections are on.""Kumar also cited court rulings at multiple occasions and said that ""courts have ruled on 42 occasions that EVMs are not hackable, allegations of tampering totally baseless.""""This is aimed at derailing the electoral process,"" he added.Further, he said that no discrepancies had been found between votes counted through Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) slips,"" he said.""Let me tell the nation today. After the Supreme Court mandated in 2019 that five VVPATs must be counted from each assembly constituency, over 67,000 VVPATs have been checked. ""This translates to more than 4.5 crore (VVPAT) slips being verified. And let me assure you that not even the difference of one vote has been found with the new machines since 2019,"" he added.Kumar defended the recent amendment to election rules restricting public access to CCTV footage from polling booths, citing the need to safeguard voter privacy and prevent misuse of data to create false narratives.""Why does he want it? Let us ask this question from the person who wants it,"" Kumar asked as he addressed the reason why the poll body had decided to block public access to CCTV footages of poll booths.The CEC explained that the poll authority has evidence showing how such data could be exploited for machine learning and AI to craft deceptive narratives. He cautioned that even fact-checkers might struggle to distinguish between genuine and AI-generated videos of polling stations.The government, acting on the Election Commission's recommendation, amended the rules last month to limit public inspection of certain electronic documents, including polling station CCTV footage, to prevent potential abuse.This comes amidst the opposition raising concerns regarding irregularities in electoral processes, with AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal recently accusing BJP of tampering with voters' lists in Delhi. The former CM had alleged that there was an ""unusual increase"" in voter list modifications, including both removals and additions, specifically in New Delhi constituency.Congress had also raised similar concerns during Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections, with Mallikarjun Kharge demanding ballot papers instead of EVMs.Assembly elections in Delhi are set to take place in a single phase on February 5.

Mass deportations under Trump: What it means for immigrants,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/mass-deportations-under-trump-what-it-means-for-immigrants/articleshow/117604259.cms,"Sunday’s operation, which led to 956 arrests nationwide, was marked by its scope and visibility.

Poll Is Mass Deportation an Effective Way to Address Immigration Issues? No, It Causes More Harm Than Good Yes, It’s Necessary for Control

For the first time, military aircraft are used to deport undocumented immigrants

Why it matters

For undocumented immigrants across the United States, including members of the Indian diaspora, Trump’s aggressive deportation plan ushers in a new era of uncertainty, fear, and potential upheaval.

Sunday’s operation, which led to 956 arrests nationwide, was marked by its scope and visibility. In Chicago, ICE collaborated with the FBI, DEA, US Marshals, and other federal agencies, targeting undocumented individuals, particularly those with prior deportation orders or criminal records.

Trump’s border czar, Tom Homan, defended the high-profile raids, asserting the importance of enforcing laws to deter future immigration violations.

This escalation comes just days after Trump signed a series of executive orders aiming to facilitate mass deportations.

Beyond undocumented immigrants, the ripple effects are felt by visa holders, mixed-status families, and even naturalized citizens, amplifying fear and uncertainty across immigrant communities. For Indian immigrants—the second-largest group overstaying visas in the US—the stakes are particularly high.

The big picture

Trump administration steps up deportation efforts

Economic and social fallout

Labor shortages: Undocumented immigrants play critical roles in sectors like agriculture, hospitality, and construction. Mass deportations risk leaving significant labor gaps, driving up costs for businesses and consumers alike.

Psychological toll: Communities report increased anxiety and depression as families live in constant fear. Children in particular suffer as schools and other community spaces lose their sense of safety.

Erosion of trust: Immigrants’ mistrust of law enforcement grows as raids escalate, deterring them from reporting crimes or cooperating with authorities.

The global impact: Trump’s immigration policies are straining diplomatic ties. Colombia’s initial refusal to accept deportees carried by US military aircraft led to threats of trade sanctions and tariffs. Though the impasse was resolved, the episode revealed the fragility of US-Latin American relations under the administration’s hardline stance.

India, too, is monitoring these developments closely. With its large expatriate population in the US, restrictive immigration measures risk souring bilateral relations. Indian government officials have repeatedly raised concerns about the treatment of Indian immigrants, particularly H-1B visa holders.

What they’re saying

Illinois governor JB Pritzker called for balanced enforcement: “We need to secure our borders, but we must also protect law-abiding residents.”

Advocacy groups condemned raids on sensitive locations like churches and schools, with Catholic leaders describing the actions as “turning places of solace into places of fear.”

Tom Homan defended the administration’s approach: “There’s consequences of entering the country illegally. If we don’t show consequences, you’re never going to fix the border problem.”

If you’re in the country illegally, you’re on the table. No one is off the table. Tom Homan, America’s new border czar

What’s next

Trump’s immigration crackdown shows no signs of slowing down. His administration is pushing for:

Increased quotas: Trump has reportedly ordered ICE to raise daily arrest numbers from 300 to 1,200-1,500.

Expanded detention facilities: ICE has called for an additional 100,000 detention beds to accommodate the influx of detainees.

Legislative changes: Executive orders targeting asylum seekers, birthright citizenship, and Temporary Protected Status (TPS) recipients are reshaping the immigration landscape.

Meanwhile, immigrant communities are mobilizing. Legal aid organizations, local governments in sanctuary cities like Chicago, and advocacy groups are stepping up efforts to provide resources, fight deportation cases, and counter the administration’s narrative.

The road ahead remains fraught, but as immigrant communities rally together, they remind the nation of its enduring promise as a land of opportunity and refuge.

Early on Sunday, Chicago became the epicenter of US President Donald Trump ’s escalated deportation agenda. Federal agents, supported by six agencies, launched a series of immigration raids targeting hundreds of undocumented immigrants. The operation, one of the most extensive under Trump ’s administration, aimed to send a clear message about his commitment to immigration enforcement.As per a Bloomberg report, at dawn, agents fanned out across the city. In the Hermosa neighborhood, they knocked on doors, shouting, “Come here,” and “Please open the door.” Many homes stayed dark and silent as immigrants—aware of their rights—refused entry without a warrant. But by mid-morning, fortunes shifted. A 28-year-old Mexican man, previously deported and with a criminal record, was arrested after returning home with tamales, the Bloomberg report said.The raid, live-streamed by Trump border czar Tom Homan and television personality Dr Phil, showcased the scale of enforcement. Immigration and Customs Enforcement(ICE) later revealed that 956 arrests were made nationwide on the same day, underscoring the aggressive push.Trump’s second term has brought intensified immigration crackdowns, reshaping enforcement dynamics. His broader strategy includes:Previously off-limits places like schools and churches are now subject to raids, further disrupting community sanctuaries.Expanded authority for ICE to deport individuals without court hearings is accelerating cases, raising concerns about due process.Sunday’s raid involved ICE, the FBI, US Marshals, and other federal entities, highlighting the militarized approach to immigration enforcement.Resistance from countries like Colombia and Mexico has created diplomatic tensions, though Colombia ultimately agreed to accept deportees after the US threatened tariffs and sanctions.Sunday’s raids reflect not only the administration’s logistical challenges but also the resilience of immigrant communities. Social media alerts, neighborhood networks, and knowledge of legal rights have made it harder for ICE to make arrests.“Usually, it just takes the first arrest and the phone calls start,” said Matthew Putra, acting field director for ICE in St. Paul, Minnesota. This grassroots resistance is complicating the government’s ability to meet Trump’s ambitious deportation quotas.For Chicago’s immigrant population, including its Indian diaspora, the implications are dire:While the majority of Indian immigrants in the US are documented, a significant number overstayed their visas. For these individuals, the specter of raids and deportation has driven them into the shadows, cutting off access to essential services and heightening anxiety.Indian professionals dominate the H-1B visa category, which is under increased scrutiny. While the deportation raids primarily target undocumented individuals, the Trump administration’s broader immigration policies have tightened legal pathways, adding hurdles for Indian workers. Delays, rejections, and visa denials are becoming more common, forcing some to consider returning to India.Families with members of varying immigration statuses face the constant threat of separation. Children who are US citizens may wake up one day to find parents deported. This instability has long-term social and psychological consequences, particularly for young children.Even legal residents and citizens of Indian origin report facing heightened racial profiling and xenophobia. The administration’s rhetoric has contributed to a broader climate of hostility against immigrants, especially those perceived as foreign.(With inputs from agencies)","Sunday’s operation, which led to 956 arrests nationwide, was marked by its scope and visibility. The ripple effects are felt by visa holders, mixed-status families, and even naturalized citizens. Immigrants’ mistrust of law enforcement grows, deterring them from reporting crimes or cooperating with authorities.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117604556,imgsize-81654,width-400,resizemode-4/117604556.jpg"

New vs Old Tax Regime: Will Old Regime Be Phased Out Soon?

Budget 2025 income tax expectations: Ever since Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman introduced the new income tax regime with reduced tax rates and almost no deductions and exemptions, salaried taxpayers have been wondering whether the old income tax regime will eventually be phased out.The new income tax regime was introduced as an optional tax regime FY 2020-21 onwards. Under the new income tax regime, common and popular exemptions like Section 80C, medical insurance premium, house rent allowance etc. are not included. What it offers is a tax regime with lower tax rates, beneficial income tax slabs and no headache of compliance burden related to deductions and exemptions.Ever since the introduction, the Narendra Modi governments have made various changes in the new tax regime including changing the income tax slab rates to make it more attractive for the taxpayer. For example, the standard deduction from taxable salary was increased to Rs 75,000 from Rs 50,000 (as available in the old tax regime) in Budget 2024.Also Read | Budget 2025 income tax: From higher tax exemption limit to increased standard deduction - top 6 expectations of common man Further, the employer’s contribution to the NPS is allowed as deduction up to 14% of specified salary as compared to 10% of salary in the old tax regime.Most personal tax experts are of the view that the government will phase out the old income tax regime in the coming years. However, they are divided on how soon, with tax experts suggesting that the old tax regime will likely be available as an option for salaried taxpayers for some more years.Apart from the taxes calculated according to the slabs mentioned above, a surcharge will be levied on the income-tax of individuals if their total income exceeds Rs 5,000,000.From FY 2023-24, the new tax regime which was optional earlier, was made the default tax regime unless the taxpayer expressly opted out of the same and selected the old tax regime.“This has resulted in the increase in the number of taxpayers adopting the new tax regime. As per the Central Board of Direct Taxes for FY 2023-25 approximately 72% of the taxpayers adopted the new tax regime as at July 2024 reflecting an increasing trend of taxpayers adopting the new tax regime,” says Parizad Sirwalla, Partner and Head, Global Mobility Services, Tax, KPMG in India.Also Read | Budget 2025 income tax: Top tax reliefs FM Sitharaman should consider in Union Budget Surabhi Marwah, Tax Partner, EY India says, “It seems unlikely that the government will completely phase out the old tax regime in the upcoming Budget. While the new tax regime has gained popularity due to its simplicity, the old regime still offers advantages to taxpayers with claims for higher exemptions and deductions.”“The government may continue to focus on encouraging the adoption of the new tax regime, possibly by making it more attractive, while maintaining both regimes for a transition period,” she told TOI.Kuldip Kumar - Partner - Mainstay Tax Advisors LLP says that the old tax regime is likely to be phased out, and this may happen through the new tax code. “The Finance Minister announced in her budget speech last year, to revamp the existing Income Tax Act,” he explains.“Alternatively, the government may make changes to the new tax regime only to provide relief to taxpayers, leaving the old regime unchanged as it did in last year's budget. This would automatically render the old regime redundant until the simplified tax code is brought into effect,” he told TOI.Aarti Raote, Partner, Deloitte India feels that with a hike in standard deduction and NPS benefits under the new tax regime, more people will adopt it. Given these reasons, the government is likely to phase out the old regime in the coming years, she says.Sundeep Agarwal, Partner, Vialto Partners says, “While the old income tax regime benefits those using deductions, its phase-out under current tax laws seems unlikely. However, with the proposed Direct Tax Code (DTC) aiming to streamline taxation and reduce complexities, dual tax structure may eventually be replaced by a single, uniform regime under the DTC.”“Hence, if the government does consider bringing an end/ sunset to the old tax regime, they may adopt a gradual phased out approach and provide a roadmap of the same in the current Budget scheduled to be presented on 1 Feb 2025,” he tells TOI.","Budget 2025 income tax expectations: The new income tax regime was introduced as an optional tax regime from FY 2020-21.

Pete Alonso’s Future Takes a Wild Turn—Could LA Be His New Home?



Pete Alonso & Blue Jays closing in on deal, has Mets position changed? | Baseball Night in NY | SNY

MLB Notebook: Padres, Michael King, Roki Sasaki, Dodgers, Jack Flaherty, Angels, Pete Alonso, Mets

Ladies and gentlemen! Just when we were ready to predict how the Pete Alonso free agency would unfold, in waltzes the Los Angeles Angels . The New York Mets have been the favorite for many months to re-sign their powerhouse first baseman. Then numbskull Angels stepped out of nowhere, believing they honestly belonged to the race for the player and feeling they were about to offer a strong enough—$100 million, four-year deal to acquire Alonso.A lot of people are still scratching their heads, wondering how such a large, albeit lucrative, deal can be handed to Alonso, a year after MLB Enter Marc Luino, who expressed doubt as to what market value could ever possibly allow him to fetch such a sum. Remember when outfielder Anthony Santander inked a five-year pact with the Blue Jays? That was the line, and Alonso's worth has been measured against it. Angels are believed to have no limits. They are ready to go all in, and one can tell they are trying to bring a different angle down on their forgettable season of 2024.Now about the dismal days of 2024, the Angels, with a sordid eye-drop season and a decade's worth of vacation-less postseason, turned back onto their fortunes. In its most unexpected shape, an off-season has seen itself begin with 12 free agents they recently signed. Twelve! And this is no addition that came very much remotely easily, in sports that are deemed a bit of a contorted dance when it comes to making competitive adjustments. Many a free-agent signing spells camaraderie across the opportunities that the team can rein in this season. However, one of the glaring needs remains an impactful bat to strike with Mike Trout and Anthony Rendon. Enter Pete Alonso, with his career stats—192 homers and 499 RBIs in just five seasons—practically screaming ""missing piece.""Hence, could Pete Alonso turn the tide for the Angels before they come out of the 2024 crash? Indeed. Just picture a team with Trout, Rendon, and Alonso in the lineup. Then the magic starts happening, and a playoff experience is almost certain with a new flavor that fans may delight in dreaming of.Alonso thinks that he is due for a shakeup. According to the Mets, the recent offer might have insulted their home run expert, inviting speculation that Alonso is now ready to seek a fresh start in greener pastures. Now that the Mets are out of the scene, going on proves that he's all set to close the door on what can be called a not-so-nice chapter. Could Toronto be the city he's going to move to? Or are the Angels offering the next chapter of his life in Los Angeles? One thing is for certain: the Angels would undeniably send to the league some bold signals concerning Alonso leading their team. They are just going on and taking a real risk this 2025 season.As the season draws near, the anticipation grows. The fate of Alonso, and potentially the Angels, hangs in the balance. As Pete Alonso weighs his future, the Angels' bold move could reshape their destiny, but only time will tell if this gamble pays off, bringing new hope to their postseason hopes.","The New York Mets have been the favorite for many months to re-sign their powerhouse first baseman Pete Alonso.

Ever wonder if a college degree is the secret to billions? The world's richest people broke not only the bank but also quite some interesting educational paths. Here are the educational journeys of elite Ivy League dropouts and people who followed rather odd routes to great wealth.Did Jeff Bezos dream of e-commerce while studying engineering? What did Elon Musk learn before targeting Mars? Does Bill Gates regret leaving Harvard? Their answers might shock you! Whether they earned fancy diplomas or dropped class to join startups, these 10 billionaires show that the road to riches is as varied as it is inspiring. So get ready to dive into their educational stories.Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla Motors, attended Queen's University in Canada but would later move to the United States to attend the University of Pennsylvania to pursue degrees in business and physics. His desire was thus fulfilled where he could be more entrepreneurial and up-to-date with the world of technology. His quest for deeper knowledge led him to Stanford University in California to pursue a PhD in energy physics. However, after being at Stanford for only two days, he decided to pursue his entrepreneurial pursuits and left college. Although Musk never completed that program, this educational background largely molded his revolutionary ideas in matters related to technology and business.Jeff Bezos, the founder and executive chairman of Amazon, graduated from Princeton University, where he earned degrees in electrical engineering and computer science. His time at Princeton was pivotal in shaping his future, as the knowledge he gained in these fields laid the groundwork for his innovative work in technology and e-commerce. With a strong foundation in both engineering and computer science, Bezos combined technical expertise with a visionary mindset to revolutionize the retail industry. He founded Amazon, which is today the global powerhouse it is.Larry Ellison initially started as a pre-med student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign but later left before completion of his studies. He thereafter enrolled in the University of Chicago where he majored in physics and mathematics. But he did not graduate. Even though he dropped out from both high school and the University of Illinois early in his academic life, Ellison had become passionate about technology and innovation, which led to co-founding Oracle as it revolutionized the soft-ware industry. It is an enlightening reminder of how educational pathways are not the definitive route to success; rather, passion sometimes leads to incredible feats.Mark Zuckerberg first went to Harvard University to study psychology and computer science. Yet, after only two years, he quit college and took up the entrepreneurial career to pursue his goals. Focusing on Facebook was much more important to him than any college where he might have spent most of his time developing the social media platform that would change the course of connectivity among online users. Although he did not graduate from Harvard, dropping out marked the beginning of an incredible journey that made him one of the most influential figures in the tech world and one of the wealthiest individuals in the world.Bernard Arnault is the man behind the LVMH empire, which comprises brands such as Louis Vuitton and cosmetics giant Sephora. He graduated from École Polytechnique in Paris with a Bachelor of Arts and Science. This institution formed the basis for Arnault's incredible journey into the world of high-end fashion and cosmetics. His education was well-equipped with the analytical skills and business acumen that would later help him build one of the most influential luxury conglomerates in the world. Arnault's success story shows how a strong academic background can blend with entrepreneurial vision to create global dominance.Larry Page, the co-founder of Google, graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in computer engineering from the University of Michigan. While studying at Michigan, he established a strong background in computer science that eventually made him interested in search engine technology. Page later continued his studies for a PhD in computer science at Stanford University, where he met Sergey Brin. Together, they worked on a research project that eventually became Google. Page left his PhD program to focus on developing Google, but his academic background played a crucial role in shaping the innovative approach that led to the creation of one of the world's most successful tech companies.Sergey Brin graduated with honors from the University of Maryland, College Park, with a Bachelor's degree in mathematics and computer science. He later acquired his Master's degree in computer science from Stanford University. At this time, he was awarded a National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship, an award that recognizes potential to grow into new talent in technology. This is where Larry Page came into his life, and he and Page started on a journeythat transformed the tech industry itself, making him the man behind Google, the world's leading search engine.Warren Buffett studied business at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Economics in 1950. After that, he studied economics at Columbia Business School, earning a Master of Science in Economics in 1951. At Columbia, he was under the mentorship of Benjamin Graham, one of the most important economists and investors, whose value investing principles Buffett used to great effect in his investment strategies.Steve Ballmer graduated from Harvard University in 1977, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in Applied Mathematics and Economics. He later attended Stanford Graduate School of Business, graduating with an MBA in 1980. His academic exposure to applied mathematics, economics, and business paved the way for his professional life at Microsoft. After joining the company in 1980, he became very close to Bill Gates, eventually taking on the position of CEO from 2000-2014 and steering the company through growth that turned it into one of the world's most valuable tech companies.The founder and CEO of NVIDIA, Jensen Huang, has impressive academic credentials. He earned his Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from Oregon State University. He further went on to obtain his Master's degree in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University. Huang's education in electrical engineering laid a foundation for his future career in technology and semiconductor industries. In 1993, he founded NVIDIA which he co-founded and made a leader in graphics processing units and AI technology that creates innovations in gaming, data centers, and artificial intelligence.","Elon Musk attended Queen's University in Canada but would later move to the U.S. to attend the University of Pennsylvania to pursue degrees in business and physics.

Poll Should Personal Struggles, Like Addiction, Be Considered in Divorce? No, Only the Relationship Matters Yes, They Should Be Considered

Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

NEW DELHI: Former Indian cricketer Vinod Kambli has once again found himself in the spotlight, this time due to revelations made by his wife, Andrea Hewitt .In a recent podcast interview with journalist Suryanshi Pandey, Hewitt provided an in-depth look into their personal life, shedding light on the challenges the couple faced, particularly Kambli's struggles with alcohol addiction .Hewitt, a former model, candidly discussed the strained relationship she shared with the left-handed batter and how she overcame the obstacles that arose. According to her, Kambli's battle with alcoholism was a significant hurdle, leading him to undergo rehabilitation at least 14 times.During the podcast, Hewitt revealed that she had contemplated divorce at one point, even going as far as filing for it.“I once thought about it (separating). But I realised that he would be helpless if I leave him. He is like a child, and that hurts me. It makes me feel worried.

Budget 2025 income tax expectations : Ever since the last Union Budget was presented in July 2024, the world has seen significant changes ranging from various elections, global economic slowdown, geopolitical developments, volatile Indian stock markets, etc. Having witnessed all of this, the common man awaits with eager anticipation from the Hon'ble Finance Minister as she gears up to unveil her eighth straight budget. Some of the key expectations that individual taxpayers may have are discussed below.It is anticipated that with the thrust of the Government on the adoption of the new tax regime, there may be no changes to the old tax regime. The basic tax exemption limit under the new tax regime is currently at Rs 3 lakh. It is hoped that this limit may be increased to Rs 5 lakh, providing more disposable income for individuals to either spend or save, thereby boosting the overall economy.The full rebate of tax is available up to income limit of Rs 7 lakh currently under the new tax regime. It is expected that this limit can be raised to Rs 10 lakh, offering relief to middle income taxpayers and making it easier for them to manage their finances.Also Read | Budget 2025 income tax: Top tax reliefs FM Sitharaman should consider in Union Budget To protect salaried taxpayers, there is a case in point to increase the standard deduction under the new regime from the current Rs 75,000 to Rs 1,00,000. This increase will help combat inflation and address the higher personal expenses incurred due to changes in work culture, such as working from home, hybrid work, and work from anywhere.n line with the Government's objective of ""Housing for All"" and fostering home ownership, it is suggested that the Government reconsider allowing deductions for interest on self-occupied housing loans under the new default tax regime.To reduce the carbon footprint and move towards clean energy, the Government should reintroduce the deduction provided under section 80EEB (deduction for interest on loan taken to purchase an electric vehicle) and extend it to the new regime as well.Also Read | Budget 2025 income tax: Individual taxpayers want FM Sitharaman to lower tax rates, make new tax regime more attractive, says survey Currently, if a property seller is a resident, buyers must deduct tax at 1% of the consideration if the property value is Rs 50 lakh or more and file a challan-cum-statement, which is a simple and convenient process. However, if the seller is a non-resident, the buyer must obtain a TAN for this one-off transaction, deduct tax at a higher rate, and file a TDS return, which is a cumbersome process. The government should consider introducing challan-cum-statement for non-resident sellers akin to resident sellers to simplify the process.The proposed measures pave the way for significantly improving financial well-being and stimulate economic growth.","It is anticipated that with the thrust of the Government on the adoption of the new tax regime, there may be no changes to the old tax regime.
