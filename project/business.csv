The case: Rolex seizure at IGI Airport

A penalty equivalent to AED 6,250

What the court said



The outcome



Why the judgment matters



The broader context



The takeaway



A single high-value product does not automatically mean commercial intent.

Declaration rules must still be followed — non-declaration can attract penalties.

Customs authorities must base decisions on context and evidence, not assumptions.





On March 7, 2024, Mahesh Malkani, an Indian citizen living in Dubai, arrived at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport wearing a Rolex Submariner worth around AED 56,000 (approximately ₹12.7 lakh). Believing he had nothing dutiable to declare, Malkani passed through the Green Channel — reserved for passengers without goods requiring customs declaration.Customs officers, however, intercepted him, seized the watch, and issued a detention receipt. Officials claimed that Malkani had used the wrong channel and violated baggage rules. They further classified the single watch as a “commercial quantity,” implying it was intended for trade rather than personal use.Following the seizure, the Commissioner of Customs at IGI Airport issued an Order-in-Original on January 30, 2025. The order allowed Malkani to redeem the Rolex watch for re-export upon payment of the following:The order required Malkani to complete the redemption within 120 days. Instead of paying, he moved the Delhi High Court , challenging both the classification of the watch as “commercial” and the penalty terms.A Division Bench of Justices Pratibha M. Singh and Sahil Jain heard the case and delivered judgment on September 17, 2025.The High Court upheld the customs department’s right to impose a redemption fine and penalty but disagreed with the classification of the Rolex as a commercial consignment. The judges observed: “Clearly, this Court is of the view that one Rolex watch cannot be held to be a commercial quantity, and there is no reason why the same cannot be kept for personal use.”The bench noted that wearing a high-value watch during international travel does not, by itself, justify treating it as a commercial import. It emphasised that customs officials must take a practical view when distinguishing between personal and commercial use.While the court did not waive the fines or penalties, it extended the redemption deadline to October 31, 2025, allowing Malkani additional time to reclaim his watch. The judgment effectively clears him to retrieve the Rolex after payment, while reaffirming that the mere possession of an expensive item cannot automatically be equated with commercial intent.The High Court also urged customs authorities to avoid arbitrary classifications in future cases, warning that such blanket assumptions may not stand up to judicial scrutiny.The decision clarifies an important grey area in customs enforcement: value alone cannot determine intent. A single high-end item, such as a luxury watch or jewellery, may still qualify as a personal belonging if it is clearly meant for personal use.Legal experts have welcomed the ruling as a sensible interpretation of customs law. Supreme Court advocate Dr. Sujay Kantawala said the judgment “underscores that customs must take a practical view of what counts as personal use versus commercial quantity.”The case also reflects broader judicial concern over how customs officers apply baggage rules, especially to international passengers carrying high-value personal goods.Under Indian customs regulations, travellers arriving from abroad are allowed to carry personal items and gifts up to a certain value without paying duty — currently around ₹45,000 (approximately AED 2,000). Anything beyond that must be declared at the Red Channel.Failure to do so can lead to detention, fines, or confiscation, even if the items are personal. Over the past year, courts have repeatedly reminded customs officials to exercise discretion, particularly when dealing with worn items such as watches or jewellery that are clearly for personal use.The Delhi High Court’s ruling sets a precedent for future customs disputes involving luxury items. It makes clear that:For travellers, the message is equally clear: when in doubt, declare. For customs, the case is a reminder that practicality and fairness must guide enforcement — not just the price tag on someone’s wrist.","Delhi High Court rules single Rolex watch worn by Dubai resident is for personal use, not commercial import.

‘U.S. Tariffs Unfair, Actively Working To Resolve Trade Issues’: EAM Jaishankar





US President Donald Trump on Monday announced a 25% tariff on all medium and heavy-duty trucks imported into the United States, effective November 1, 2025.“Beginning November 1st, 2025, all Medium and Heavy Duty Trucks coming into the United States from other Countries will be Tariffed at the Rate of 25%. Thank you for your attention to this matter!” Trump wrote in a post on his social media platform Truth Social.Trump had earlier indicated that new duties on heavy truck imports would take effect on October 1, but the timeline was pushed back. The new announcement marks the latest step in his broader tariff agenda aimed at boosting domestic manufacturing.As per Bloomberg, the 25% duties are part of Trump’s expanding trade measures designed to “protect domestic industries.” The decision follows a probe launched in April by the US commerce department under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, which allows the government to impose import taxes on goods considered vital to national security.The investigation focused on medium- and heavy-duty trucks weighing over 10,000 pounds and their components, noting that a “small number” of foreign suppliers dominate the market due to “predatory trade practices.”Last month, Trump introduced a series of tariff announcements — including 100% on pharmaceutical products, 50% on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, and 30% on upholstered furniture — set to begin in October.At the time, he said the 25% tariff on heavy trucks would safeguard major American truck manufacturers such as Peterbilt, Kenworth, Freightliner and Mack Trucks.“In order to protect our Great Heavy Truck Manufacturers from unfair outside competition, I will be imposing a 25% Tariff,” Trump wrote then, describing the move as essential to keeping the nation’s truckers “financially healthy and strong” for “national security purposes”.Trump has defended his protectionist measures as a strategy to promote domestic production, despite criticism that higher import duties could increase costs for consumers and businesses.",US President Donald Trump on Monday announced a 25% tariff on all medium and heavy-duty trucks imported into the United States.

Mumbai: To encourage the economically weaker sections to install rooftop solar panels and give them the opportunity to have ‘zero' monthly electricity bills, the state govt on Monday issued a GR announcing a 90%-95% subsidy for below poverty line (BPL), SC and ST consumers with monthly power consumption below 100 units.For a 1KW solar panel, which can generate around 120 units per month, the cost of installation will be around Rs 50,000.

NEW DELHI: On a day that marked the beginning of his 25th continuous year on a constitutional post - he first took office as Gujarat CM in 2001 - PM Narendra Modi emphasised his resolve to work even harder towards realising ""country's collective dream of a Viksit Bharat"".""Thanks to the continuous blessings of my fellow Indians, I am entering my 25th year of serving as the head of a government.

SBI’s fraud tag on Anil & RCom has no infirmity: HC

MUMBAI: Bombay high court has said it’s evident that once a company account is declared as fraud, the promoter or directors in control of affairs would automatically be liable to penal measures, reported as fraud and debarred from raising funds or seeking credit facilities, as they were responsible for the acts or omissions of the company.The high court said so while dismissing Anil Ambani ’s challenge to an SBI order that termed Reliance Communications ’ (RCom’s) loan account as “fraud” and reported his name to Reserve Bank of India under fraud detection guidelines.For Anil Ambani , senior counsel Darius Khambata said despite the fact that there were no allegations against Ambani in a show-cause notice of December 2023, and he was not a whole-time director of the company, his name was reported.HC said the law was well settled and there was no need to spell out specific allegations against the promoter and director having control over the company, which, in this case, Ambani had during the relevant period. Ambani’s defence argued principles of natural justice were flouted as he was given no personal hearing before his name was reported too, and also similar orders against other non-executive directors were dropped.The HC, in a reasoned judgment available Tuesday, said “the role of the other directors, who were exonerated, was different and distinct from that of the present petitioner, inasmuch as they were non-executive directors and were not responsible for the day-to-day functioning of RCOM.”SBI had said it reported Ambani’s name under terms of Master Directions on Fraud Risk Management in Commercial Banks and All India Financial Institutions dated 15 July 2024.An HC division bench on October 3 found the SBI order to be a reasoned one sans any infirmity and Ambani’s petition challenging it with “no merit” and dismissed it.HC said the show cause notice detailed the basis of the declaration of fraud as contemplated by SBI. It said the erstwhile non-executive director failed to reply and continued to seek documents, leading to SBI finally proceeding to pass the order.HC said principles of natural justice don’t have a straitjacket formula, but so long as Ambani was “afforded an adequate opportunity to submit his objections in writing, the requirement of fairness and compliance with the principle of natural justice stood satisfied.”"," Bombay high court said it’s evident that once a company account is declared as fraud, the promoter or directors in control of affairs would automatically be liable to penal measures.

On this day twenty-five years ago, Prime Minister Narendra Modi took oath as the chief minister of Gujarat — a moment that would shape not just his political journey but also the trajectory of the Bharatiya Janata Party Under his leadership, the BJP has grown exponentially, expanding its footprint across states and consolidating its influence at the Centre.As he completes a 25 years in public service, here’s looking at his major milestonesAlso read: 'On this day ...': PM Modi shares nostalgic pictures on day he first became Gujarat CM Appointed Gujarat’s chief minister in 2001 to replace Keshubhai Patel, PM Modi took charge amid post-earthquake challenges and political instability. He led the BJP to three consecutive assembly wins — in 2002, 2007, and 2012 — becoming the state’s longest-serving CM. His governance style in the state came to be known as the “Gujarat Model”.2014 was a watershed moment. He led the BJP to its first solo majority in three decades, ending the coalition era and reducing Congress to 44 seats. This victory marked the end of coalition politics and established the BJP as a dominant force. Congress experienced its worst-ever performance. As a result, there was no official leader of the opposition in the 16th Lok Sabha, as a party needed at least 10% of the seats (55 seats) to qualify.Surpassing predecessors like Dr. Manmohan Singh and Atal Bihari Vajpayee, PM Modi now ranks as the third longest-serving Prime Minister of the country. This feat makes him the first non-Congress leader to achieve such a long and consequential tenure, a period exceeded only by Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi.Under PM Modi's leadership, the BJP delivered two stunning electoral performances. In 2014 and 2019, the BJP won 282 and 303 Lok Sabha seats respectively — both clear majorities. Even in 2024, though the party fell short of a solo majority with 240 seats, the NDA coalition retained power with the support of Nitish Kumar and Chandrababu Naidu.PM Modi's approval ratings consistently rank among the highest for global democratic leaders. According to global intelligence firm Morning Consult, Prime Minister Modi's domestic approval rating consistently hovers around 75%. His approval rating is over 30 points higher than that of the US President Donald Trump.The BJP’s geographical growth under his tenure has been transformative. When he took office nationally in 2014, the NDA governed seven states. By mid-2024, the coalition had successfully expanded its rule to more than 18 states. The party’s presence deepened in regions once seen as out of bounds, from the Northeast to southern India.Leveraging digital platforms for immediate communication, PM Modi is one of the most followed world leaders, commanding over 108 million followers on X, formerly known as Twitter. His adept use of social media has created a direct communication channel with citizens, bypassing traditional media filters.The party’s parliamentary strength has grown dramatically, increasing from 161 Lok Sabha and 49 Rajya Sabha seats in 2013 to a current strength of 240 and 102, respectively. Furthermore, the Congress's failure to secure the required 10% seats meant the leader of opposition post remained vacant for two consecutive terms (2014 and 2019).Illustrating the surge in popular support, the BJP’s national vote share saw a 12-point jump, rising sharply from 18.8% in 2009 to 31% in 2014. It peaked in 2019 to 37.36% before a marginal dip in 2024, when the NDA still formed the government.Under his leadership, India’s economic scale has achieved a significant milestone, more than doubling its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in under ten years. India has gone from being the 10th largest in 2014 to 4th largest in 11 years under the Modi government. India is now the 4th largest economy in the world, in nominal GDP terms, overtaking Japan, and is behind only the US, China, and Germany. According to the IMF, India’s GDP currently stands at $4.3 trillion.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi marks 25 years of public service. Modi is the third longest-serving Prime Minister of the country.

NEW DELHI: The ram air turbine (RAT) of an Air India Dreamliner deployed on its final approach, seconds before landing at 400 feet, to Birmingham on Saturday. The aircraft landed safely and has been grounded for checks. The RAT - a last-resort emergency power system - was deployed seconds after the ill-fated Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner lifted off from Ahmedabad on June 12.While the Boeing 787 was released for service by Sunday evening (India time), the directorate general of civil aviation (DGCA) says “requires detailed investigation” which has been assigned to a senior air safety official. At the time of filing this story, Air India was evaluating whether to operate the about 12-year-old VT-ANO back to India as a scheduled or a ferry (without passengers) flight.RAT - a last-resort emergency power system - was deployed seconds after the ill-fated Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner lifted off from Ahmedabad on June 12. Hence its deployment created a flutter on Saturday when the deployment happened on yet another AI B787-8 Dreamliner.In a statement, Air India said: “The operating crew of flight AI117 from Amritsar to Birmingham on Oct 4, 2025, detected deployment of the Ram Air Turbine (RAT) of the aircraft during its final approach.All electrical and hydraulic parameters were found normal, and the aircraft performed a safe landing at Birmingham. The aircraft has been grounded for further checks and consequently, AI114 from Birmingham to Delhi has been cancelled and alternative arrangements are being made to accommodate the guests. At Air India, the safety of passengers and crew remains top priority.”AI 117 had taken off from Amritsar at 12.52 pm on Oct 4. “During landing at 400 feet, RAT unlock message came and RAT got deployed. Pilots did not report any related abnormality. The aircraft landed safely (at Birmingham 7.07 pm, all local timings),” said a senior official, adding, “Boeing has issued a ‘fleet team digest’ containing brief of previous such cases.”According to aviation website Skybrary: “RAT is a small turbine that is installed in an aircraft and used as an alternate or emergency hydraulic or electrical power source. (It) generates power from the airstream based on the speed of the aircraft and is connected to an electrical generator or to a hydraulic pump.”“In general, modern aircraft only utilise RAT in emergency: either in the event of loss of hydraulic systems or following the loss of primary electrical generation. In these cases the RAT will power vital systems such as flight controls or flight-critical instrumentation, navigation and communication equipment. Some RATs produce only hydraulic power which in turn is used to power an electrical generator,” Skybrary adds.","The ram air turbine (RAT) of an Air India Dreamliner deployed on its final approach, seconds before landing at 400 feet.

Bihar Assembly Polls: EC Announces Two-Phase Voting, Unveils 17 New Measures For Transparent Voting

NEW DELHI: While hearing NGO-petitioners against the special intensive revision of the Bihar electoral rolls on Tuesday, the Supreme Court said that since it appears that there is an appreciation of numbers from the draft rolls, to avoid any confusion, the identity of add-ons should be disclosed.""You'd agree with us that the degree of transparency and access has improved in the electoral process. It appears from the data that there was a 65-lakh deletion in the draft list which you published, and we said whoever is dead or moved is all right, but if you are deleting someone, please follow Rule 21 and the SOP.""""We also said that whoever is deleted, please put up their data in your electoral offices. Now the final list appears to be an appreciation of numbers and there is confusion in the general democratic process - what is the identity of the add-ons, are they of deleted names or new names,"" Justice Joymalya Bagchi said.With EC counsel Rakesh Dwivedi insisting that the NGO represented by Prashant Bhushan should file affidavits by individuals alleging that their names were deleted without intimation, the bench of Justices Surya Kant and Bagchi wondered, ""For whom was this exercise undertaken (by the NGO)?""Senior advocate Maninder Singh recalled petitioner Yogendra Yadav bringing to the courtroom two voters whose names were deleted as dead and said, ""EC repeatedly requested the person concerned to give details of the two individuals to enable the commission to carry out necessary corrections.Till date no detail has been given.""The Justice Kant-led bench said, ""We also have information about the two voters but do not want to disclose in open court."" While agreeing to hear Yadav for 30 minutes on Thursday, the bench told Bhushan to bring affidavits of people whose names were deleted without being informed about it.EC repudiated this by saying of the 65 lakh deleted names - 22 lakh deceased, 36 lakh permanently shifted and seven lakh enrolled at multiple places - not a single individual has filed an appeal against deletion. Dwivedi said no political party has facilitated a single person since Oct 1, when the final voter list was published, to file an appeal.When Bhushan sought details of the names deleted after SIR, EC said it can be easily verified by the NGO by comparing the Jan 2025 voter list and the final voter list published on Oct 1. Bhushan said it would be a very tedious exercise for the petitioner when the requisite information can be provided within minutes by the EC.When Bhushan continued to object to the way SIR was conducted, the bench said, ""We cannot be conducting a roving inquiry into the finalisation of electoral rolls by EC in exercise of its statutory duties. Our aim was to facilitate the poll panel in conducting the exercise smoothly and transparently.""","The Supreme Court said that since it appears that there is an appreciation of numbers from the draft rolls, to avoid any confusion, the identity of add-ons should be disclosed.

Fat-loss drug Mounjaro now India's No. 2 pharma brand,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/fat-loss-drug-mounjaro-now-indias-no-2-pharma-brand/articleshow/124374071.cms,"Representative image

Augmentin unit value lower than Mounjaro’s

NEW DELHI: Soaring demand for weight-loss therapies has brought Eli Lilly's Mounjaro within striking distance of Indian pharma market's long standing market leader GlaxoSmithKline's Augmentin, an antibiotic.During September, Mounjaro recorded sales of Rs 80 crore, becoming the second-largest brand in the pharma retail market, latest data culled by TOI from market research firm Pharmatrac showed. As against this, Augmentin generated sales of Rs 85 crore during the month.Typically, top-selling medicines in the pharmaceutical market are either Augmentin or anti-diabetic therapy, Mixtard, which generates around Rs 75-80 crore in monthly sales. Launched in March this year, Mounjaro generated a cumulative revenue of Rs 233 crore by September.Industry experts said the introduction of Mounjaro in a pre-filled device, KwikPen, in August has boosted sales.A key reason for the sales is the higher unit value of the drug even though the volumes are lower. Average monthly cost of Mounjaro for a patient starts from Rs 14,000 and goes up to Rs 27,000, depending on the prescription.In contrast, a strip of 10 tablets of Augmentin 625 Duo costs under Rs 200.Sales of Mounjaro's rival, Wegovy, marketed by Novo Nordisk, have, however, plateaued around Rs 9 crore. The company is said to be cutting sales jobs, amid rising competition in the segment. Overall, the organised pharma retail market mopped up total sales of over Rs 20,000 crore in September, a growth of 7.3%, the latest data added. Market expansion was driven by new product introductions and price hikes, with all therapies reporting higher value.Augmentin and Glycomet GP continue to retain their leadership position at the MAT (moving annual total) level. Sept was also the month when the GST reduction from 18% to 5% was rolled out. A slight disturbance was seen in the distribution channel during the month, though there was no disruption at the retail level, experts said.","During September, Mounjaro recorded sales of Rs 80 crore, becoming the second- largest brand in the pharma retail market.

New Delhi: Supreme Court on Tuesday took serious note of rising discontent among more than 20,000 judicial officers, with those who joined the service at entry level alleging Tuesday that advocates directly recruited as district judges have scuttled their chances to head the district judiciary and be elevated as high court judges.A bench of Chief Justice B R Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran said a balance needs to be struck between the competing interests of entry-level judicial officers and those directly recruited for the post of district judges (DJs), and decided to refer the issue to a five-judge Constitution bench for a lasting solution.CJI Gavai said, ""A youngster who chooses a career in the judiciary and joins as a civil judge junior division at the age of 25 aspires to become a district judge and subsequent elevation to high court. It cannot be disputed that one who spends 25 years in judicial service is rich in experience and rightly aspires to become a high court judge.""He highlighted that there have been very few instances where a civil judge junior division has retired as a Supreme Court judge.But the CJI did not discount the fact that an advocate who joins as district judge through direct recruitment too aspires to at least become an HC judge. Generally, those who join the services at entry level have very little chance of becoming even a district judge given the large number of advocates recruited directly as district judges.",Those who joined the service at entry level allege that advocates directly recruited as district judges have scuttled their chances to head the district judiciary.

PM Modi To Inaugurate Navi Mumbai Airport On October 8: All About ₹19,650 Cr Aviation Marvel

NEW DELHI: Setting the ground for establishing an apex Transport Planning Authority, PM Narendra Modi on Tuesday chaired a meeting of cabinet ministers and secretaries responsible for transport-related ministries, which will be tasked with the comprehensive planning for the entire transportation ecosystem.Sources said the best international examples were discussed in the meeting, including the Korea Transport Institute (KOTI), a think tank under the PMO in South Korea that provides recommendations and alternatives for the nation’s transport policy. They added that other models of preparing transport plans, including of China, were also discussed.“PM has been vocal about breaking silos and going for integrated planning of infrastructure development. He emphasised the need for integrated transport planning to get maximum results. The need of an ecosystem for this in India was discussed in detail, considering that at present there is no apex agency and each ministry has its own vision document. There is less inter-ministerial, state brainstorming and everything is mostly consultant driven,” said a source.TOI on Sept 23 had reported the government’s plan to set up an apex empowered agency for preparation of comprehensive transport strategies for all modes of transportation and end-to-end mobility.Sources said that due to a lack of such an entity there are no defined five-year or 10-year plans and the PM Gatishakti National Master Plan has become only a project appraisal platform. Moreover, there are multiple frameworks for monitoring projects and there is no agency to suggest global best practices and innovative methods of implementation. “There is also no agency to take up policy advocacy and recommend changes in Acts and rules. There is no mechanism of mid-course correction in case of failure,” said an official.As per the plan, a National Institute for Transport Planning will be set up while a Gati-Shakti Transport Planning and Research Organisation will be established in the cabinet secretariat.To begin with, the govt will constitute a Group of Transport Experts (GTE) in fields like transport planning, supply chain management, data science and network optimisation from IITs in Delhi, Chennai and BHU, and BITS (Pilani). This will provide technical support to the sectoral group of secretaries. The group will suggest appropriate plans for five, 10 and 15 years.","PM Narendra Modi on Tuesday chaired a meeting of cabinet ministers and secretaries responsible for transport-related ministries.

Bihar Assembly Polls: EC Announces Two-Phase Voting, Unveils 17 New Measures For Transparent Voting

NEW DELHI: Seat-sharing talks between Rashtriya Janata Dal and CPI (M-L) Liberation hit a roadblock with the Left party rejecting the offer of 19 seats - the same as what it contested in 2020 - from Tejaswi Yadav ’s party as against their demand for anywhere between 40 to 45 seats.The CPI (ML) leadership sees the proposal for 19 seats offered by RJD on Monday as neither ""dignified"" nor ""respectable"". However, on Tuesday the Left party decided to convey a fresh offer and sent a list of around 30 seats to RJD which sources said will be ""non-negotiable"".""The offer of 19 seats is unacceptable and there too they have changed a few seats. Now we have made an offer of around 30 seats which is non-negotiable,"" the source said.The ""ball is now in Tejaswi Yadav’s court,"" and “all options are open” is what a source in the party said when asked what would be the course of action if RJD does not agree to the proposal.Last time the Left party had won 12 out of 19 seats in the assembly polls and 2 out of the 3 seats it fought in Lok Sabha in 2024 as part of the ""Mahagathbandhan"". Currently it holds 11 seats in the assembly as 1 was lost in the bye-election of 2024.On RJD's attempts to tell Allies including the Congress to be realistic, the Left party sources when asked made it clear that it is Tejaswi Yadav who has to be “realistic” if he wants to be the CM of Bihar.Party sources say that in 2020 too they had asked for a higher number of seats but agreed to contest on 19 as it was the first time they were coming into the alliance in Bihar and delivered by winning 12.In 2024, Lok Sabha polls too while the Left party had asked for more seats they got 3 and of that their candidates won 2, sources said. “So, we have not just contested on the seats but also got votes and won seats for the alliance,” the party source said.This time besides seeking the 19 seats from 2020, CPI (M-L) has also included in its proposals seats in new districts like Dharbhanga, Madhubani, Nalanda, Gaya and even Champaran where it sees the potential to counter the NDA.The Mahagathbandhan led by RJD comprises Congress, the Left parties - CPI, CPI(M), and CPI(ML) – and Mukesh Sahni's Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP)."," CPI (M-L) Liberation rejects the offer of 19 seats from Tejaswi Yadav’s party.

The provision introduced in 2019 says that where failure on the part of designated authority, contractor, consultant or concessionaire responsible for complying with standards for road design, construction and maintenance, results in death or disability, such authority or contractor or concessionaire shall be punishable with a fine of up to Rs 1 lakh.However, there has not been a single instance when this provision was enforced and any penalty imposed in the past six years. “The directive to hold people accountable is important as at present it’s easy to pass the buck. But to enforce this, there must be a proper scientific investigation into any crash,” said a road safety expert.The court’s directive for establishment of a simple and effective online grievance redressal mechanism by the landowning agencies to deal with complaints pertaining to lack of maintenance of footpaths and the requirement of pedestrian crossings is also crucial considering there is no such system in place at present.The SC has also directed the authorities to respond to complaints within a specified timeframe and ensure that the issue is resolved in a time-bound manner.“The grievance redressal system must incorporate a review mechanism by higher authorities, to be invoked in cases where the complainant is not satisfied with the resolution provided,” the order said.Taking cognizance of accidents caused by wrong-lane driving, the court directed state transport departments, traffic police authorities and urban local bodies to enforce lane discipline by using automated cameras, graduated fines, coloured and textured lane markings, dynamic lighting, rumble strips and tyre killers at critical accident-prone points.The court has also instructed the road transport ministry, state transport departments and traffic police authorities to prescribe maximum permissible luminance and beam angles for vehicle headlights and ensure compliance through checks during PUC testing and vehicle fitness certification, and conduct targeted drives to penalise non-compliant or modified headlights.“A complete ban on unauthorised red–blue strobe flashing lights and illegal hooters shall be enforced through seizure, market crackdowns and penalties,” it said.","Supreme Court orders govts to hold officials and contractors personally liable in cases of pedestrian deaths caused due to infrastructural or design issues.

""No factory in Punjab will have to pause for electricity. No farmer will be left in the dark,"" Mann said.The state has allocated Rs 5,000 crore for the project, which the government described as the largest-ever investment in Punjab’s power sector. The funds will be used to upgrade transmission lines, repair old infrastructure and build new substations to strengthen supply networks.The government has secured a long-term coal supply from the Pachhwara mine and taken control of the GVK Thermal Plant to ensure stable generation under state supervision.In urban areas, the government has also launched a drive across 13 municipal corporations to remove hanging cables, fix open meter boxes and improve public safety. A new 180-seat call centre in Mohali has been set up to enhance the 1912 helpline for quicker grievance redressal.Mann said the 'Roshan Punjab' mission aims to make Punjab self-reliant in power and lay the foundation for a ""brighter future"" for its people.","The Punjab government has launched an ambitious 'Roshan Punjab' mission aimed at ensuring round-the-clock affordable electricity across the state within a year.

NEW DELHI: An advocate attempted to hurl a shoe at Chief Justice of India (CJI) BR Gavai on Monday, allegedly in protest against his recent “go ask your deity” remark made while hearing a plea seeking reconstruction of a Lord Vishnu idol in Madhya Pradesh’s Khajuraho.An advocate, who was heard shouting slogans, was quickly escorted out of the courtroom by security personnel. The incident caused a brief interruption for a few minutes in proceedings before the session resumed, reported Live Law.According to lawyers present, the individual shouted, “” (“India will not tolerate disrespect towards Sanatan Dharma”) while being removed from the courtroom. Some witnesses claimed he tried to throw a shoe, while others said he appeared to be hurling a roll of paper. The man was reportedly dressed in a lawyer's robe.Reacting to the incident, CJI Gavai said: ""Don't get distracted by all this. We are not distracted. These things do not affect me.""Terming it a ""publicity interest litigation"", the Supreme Court last month dismissed a plea seeking directions to reconstruct and reinstall a seven-foot idol of Lord Vishnu at the Javari Temple, part of the UNESCO World Heritage Khajuraho temple complex in MP.A bench headed by Chief Justice B R Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran refused to entertain the plea filed by one Rakesh Dalal, who sought the replacement and consecration of the damaged idol at the Javari Temple in Chhatarpur district.""This is purely publicity interest litigation...

""It's an archaeological find, whether ASI would permit such a thing to be done or not... there are various issues,"" CJI said.The CJI added, ""In the meantime, if you are not averse to Shaivism, you can go and worship there... there is a very big linga of Shiva, one of the biggest in Khajuraho.""",An advocate attempted to hurl a shoe at Chief Justice of India (CJI) BR Gavai on Monday.

Finland is ranked as the world's happiest country in the World Happiness Report, and continues to attract global talent with its high quality of life, robust social welfare system, and stunning natural landscapes. For Indian citizens, obtaining permanent residency (PR) in this Nordic nation represents a gateway to indefinite living and working rights, family reunification, and finally, citizenship. Recent immigration updates in 2025 have refined pathways for non-EU skilled workers, making Finland an appealing destination amid labour shortages in sectors like IT, healthcare, and engineering.Permanent residency in Finland allows non-EU citizens, including Indians, to live and work in the country indefinitely while enjoying access to essential public services such as healthcare and education. It also enables unrestricted travel within the Schengen Area. Unlike temporary residence permits, permanent residency does not expire, though the residence card must be renewed every five years within the specified timeframe. It is important to note that permanent residency differs from citizenship — obtaining Finnish citizenship requires meeting additional criteria, such as demonstrating language proficiency and maintaining a longer period of continuous residence, typically eight years.Recent updates in 2025 have targeted work visas and family reunification rather than permanent residency directly. For example, family sponsors are now required to have resided in the country for at least two years, and spouses must be a minimum of 21 years old. Meanwhile, work permits have been streamlined for specialists, with fast-track processing available for high-salary roles, requiring a monthly gross income of at least EUR 1,600 (approximately INR 1.65 lakh).To qualify, you must have lived continuously in Finland for four years on a Type A (continuous) residence permit, starting either from your entry date or the permit’s issuance. Time spent on Type B (temporary) permits, issued for short-term work, does not count toward this period. Additionally, you must have physically resided in Finland for at least two of these four years. Any absences for holidays or work abroad must be properly documented.The basis for your temporary permit, like employment, family ties, must still hold, for you to apply for a PR. Permanent Residence is not available to students or those on job-seeker permits. Before submitting a PR application, you must first transition to a Type A work or family-based permit.Although permanent residency doesn’t directly mandate these, obtaining the initial Type A permit typically requires financial and professional stability. For employment-based applications, candidates must either earn at least EUR 40,000 annually (around INR 41.3 lakh) or hold a recognised master’s/postgraduate degree with a minimum of two years of relevant experience. Alternatively, demonstrating C1-level proficiency in Finnish or Swedish along with three years of work experience can also strengthen eligibility.Applicants must provide a clean criminal record (police clearance from India), valid health insurance, and proof of accommodation. They should have no outstanding debts or dependence on social welfare. Any criminal history may negatively impact the approval process.Indians typically start with a temporary residence permit application from India, then apply for PR after four years while in Finland. Processing can take a long time so be flexible with your plans.Secure a job offer, university admission, or family tie. Apply online via Enter Finland or at VFS Global centres in India. Submit biometrics and documents like passport, job contract, salary proof, apostilled certificates, and police clearance.Live in Finland on your Type A permit, extending as required.Gather passport, photos, proof of residence, income/salary slips, educational certificates, trip logs (absences), and family details if applicable.Apply in Finland before your current permit expires. Use Enter Finland with Finnish ID for faster processing.Prove identity at a Migri service point Check status via Migri's Processing Time Checker. If approved, collect your biometric PR card.Rejections (e.g., due to incomplete docs) can be appealed within 30 days for a fee of approximately EUR 260. .For unemployed permit holders, a three-month grace period applies to find new work.Here are some benefits and considerations for Indians: Indians have the perks of indefinite stay, family sponsorship, Schengen travel, free education/healthcare, and a path to citizenship after eight years (with language tests). However there are some challenges that come with this. Some of the challenges are cold climate, language barriers (Finnish/Swedish), high living costs overall, which require proper preparation and adaptability for a smooth transition to life in Finland.Also See: Sweden becomes the first country to be prescribed by doctors: Inside “The Swedish Prescription” campaign","Finland is ranked as the world's happiest country in the World Happiness Report.

"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on why he supports Donald Trump's $100,000 H-1B Visa fee",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-on-why-he-supports-donald-trumps-100000-h-1b-visa-fee/articleshow/124317437.cms,"Huang: “America has one singular brand—The Dream”



'Brightest minds' essential to America's future argues Huang



Critics warn of talent exodus







US President Donald Trump passed an executive order increasing the H-1B visa fees last month. After the revised regulation the H-1B visa fee for fresh application stands at $100,000. Now, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has voiced his support from Trump’s proposal to impose $1,00,000 fee. Speaking on the BG2 Pod last week, Huang called the move ‘a great start’. Huang said that the increase in the H-1B visa fees will help in reshaping the immigrant policy, even as critics warn the beginning on brain drain and undermine America’s tech leadership.Speaking about his own journey as an immigrant, Huang stressed on the symbolic power of the American dream. “America has one singular brand reputation that no country in the world has—the American dream… what country has the word dream behind it?” he said. He recounted how his parents sent him to the U.S. with no money, and how he built his life from scratch: “We started from nothing… and here I am.”Along with this, Huang also acknowledged that the fees of $100,000 is quite high but he believes that this increase will set a meaningful threshold. “Probably sets the bar a little too high, but as a first bar, it at least eliminates illegal immigration and that’s a good start,” he added.In a separate CNBC interview Monday, Huang reinforced his position on immigration reform. ""We want all the brightest minds to come to the United States. Remember immigration is the foundation of the American dream, and we represent the American dream,"" he told CNBC, expressing support for Trump's efforts to address the immigration system.Nvidia employed 1,519 H-1B visa holders out of 36,000 employees worldwide at the end of fiscal year 2025, making it one of the largest tech employers of H-1B workers in the United States, according to a Business Insider analysis from March. The White House clarified earlier this month that the $100,000 fee applies only to new applicants, not visa renewals.Announced last month by the Trump administration, the H-1B visa fee hike is described as a one-time charge for new applications. The increase is fees is aimed at prioritising American workers over immigrants. However, the economist and the tech leaders feel that this move could adversely affect the US.

History of Daylight saving time



Congressional debate and division over ending daylight saving time



Health risks and state efforts to end the twice-yearly clock changes

Daylight saving time (DST) is trending again as Americans get ready to adjust their clocks this fall. Observed since the 1960s, DST was created to maximise longer summer evenings by moving clocks forward in spring and back in autumn. In 2025, clocks will “fall back” on November 2 at 2 am, giving an extra hour of sleep but earlier sunsets in many regions. While some lawmakers and citizens support making DST permanent, others prefer standard time year-round, and many favor keeping the current system. Congressional efforts, including the Sunshine Protection Act of 2025, aim to resolve this debate, but progress has stalled. For now, Americans should prepare to enjoy that extra hour when DST ends, while also considering potential impacts on health, safety, and daily routines across different communities.As per the reports, Daylight Saving Time in 2025 will end on Sunday, November 2, at 2 a.m., when clocks will be set back one hour to 1 a.m. This marks the second-earliest possible date for the seasonal time change to conclude. For Americans, this means an extra hour of sleep, earlier sunsets, and longer, darker nights in many parts of the country, affecting daily routines, travel plans, and sleep schedules.Next year, Daylight Saving Time will begin again on Sunday, March 8, 2026, when clocks “spring forward” to extend evening daylight and promote outdoor activity.The “spring forward, fall back” pattern has become ingrained in American life, but it has also sparked growing controversy over health, public safety, and long-term energy efficiency.Daylight saving time was first implemented widely in the US during World War II and later reintroduced in 1973 to conserve energy amid an oil crisis. However, public resistance led to its repeal just a year later. Since the 1960s, DST has been observed nearly nationwide, though some states, like Arizona and Hawaii, have opted out.The practice was designed to make better use of daylight, reducing the need for artificial lighting and giving longer summer evenings. Over the years, however, researchers and policymakers have debated its impact on sleep patterns, health, and productivity.Lawmakers have repeatedly attempted to eliminate the twice-yearly clock changes. In March 2022, the US Senate unanimously voted to make daylight saving time permanent, but the effort stalled in the House of Representatives due to lack of consensus.As reported by The Oklahoman, most recently, a bipartisan group of 16 senators renewed the push to keep DST year-round, but Congress has yet to hold hearings. In December, President Donald Trump also expressed support for ending daylight saving time, calling it “inconvenient” and “costly” for the nation.The American public and lawmakers remain divided: some favor staying on standard time year-round, others advocate for permanent daylight saving time, while many prefer to maintain the current system. H.R. 139, known as the Sunshine Protection Act of 2025, was introduced by Rep. Vern Buchanan (R-Florida) to make daylight saving time permanent across the US The bill would allow states that already do not observe DST to remain on standard time, giving them flexibility.An identical version was introduced in the Senate on January 7, 2025. Together, the two bills have 45 cosponsors, including Rep. Stephanie Bice (R-Oklahoma). Despite growing interest, the legislation has yet to see significant movement.Critics of the twice-yearly time change argue that switching clocks can lead to sleep disruption, reduced productivity, and increased health risks. While proponents of year-round DST argue it can improve evening leisure time and economic activity, history shows that public opinion is often mixed, with concerns about darker winter mornings and safety.Since 2015, around 30 states have considered or passed legislation to end the semi-annual clock changes, sometimes contingent on neighboring states doing the same.","Daylight Saving Time in 2025 will end on Sunday, November 2, at 2 a.m., when clocks will be set back one hour to 1 a. m.

Cough syrup row: Hunt on for Tamil Nadu pharma firm owner; a revered ‘guide’ of entrepreneurs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/cough-syrup-row-hunt-on-for-tamil-nadu-pharma-firm-owner-a-revered-guide-of-entrepreneurs/articleshow/124375994.cms,"Representative Image





CHENNAI: A longstanding name in Tamil Nadu’s pharmaceutical industry is now at the centre of a police manhunt after being linked to the deaths of 17 children in MP after consuming adulterated cough syrup.G Ranganathan, 73, a pharmacy graduate from Madras Medical College, built his reputation over more than four decades as the man behind Pronit, a nutritional syrup that once had a strong presence in the local market.In the early 1980s, he personally visited paediatricians across Chennai, going door to door and explaining at length the benefits of the syrup for pregnant women.The product quickly became popular, but its success was interrupted when the state drug control department intervened and flagged the composition for requiring govt approval.The product was promoted as a ‘nutritional food supplement’, but the ingredients used in its making required prior approval from the state drug control department.Ranganathan was then forced to obtain a proper licence, regularising the product.Soon after, similar products began to emerge, and competition in the market pushed him to move into other areas, particularly liquid nasal products. He eventually expanded his business into several small manufacturing units located in and around Chennai, said M N Sridhar, a retired drug control officer.Over the years, he came to head Sresan Pharmaceuticals and maintained association with Ceego Labs, while his close associates operated Iven Healthcare.“Within industry circles, he earnedrecognition for mentoring younger entrepreneurs, guiding graduates who were interested in starting small-scale manufacturing ventures, and remaining visible at various conferences and meetings until very recently,” said J Jeyaselan, a Chennaibased drug manufacturer.That professional image stands in contrast to his disappearance now. His 2,000sqft unit along the Chennai-Bengaluru highway has been sealed, and his registered office in Kodambakkam remains locked. Neighbours recall that the premises, once a busy first-floor apartment office drawing steady visitors, was cleared out only last week.Employees were seen moving out equipment and computers late at night. A lone security guard now redirects all visitors to Ranganathan’s lawyer, who refuses to disclose any details.Industry sources describe the turn of events as unexpected, noting that he was never associated with malpractices earlier.","G Ranganathan, 73, a pharmacy graduate from Madras Medical College, built his reputation over more than four decades as the man behind Pronit.

Need exposure to complex projects





“Manipal is like a mini Koramangala (one of Bengaluru’s tech hotspots). You have the best nightlife, 55,000 students from some 35 countries.” That’s what Rohith Bhat told us in 2021, soon after his Udupi-based app development company Robosoft was acquired by Japan’s TechnoPro Holdings for Rs 805 crore.Yet, we tended to assume that Robosoft’s acquisition was a oneoff for the coastal region of Mangaluru-Manipal-Udupi. We’ve been proved wrong. Since that acquisition, there have been two other big acquisitions of companies in that 60-km belt – Google Cloud specialist Niveus Solutions, founded by Suyog Shetty, Rashmi George, Roshan Bava, and Mohsin Khan, was acquired by Japan’s NTT Data last year; and automation services company Novigo Solutions, founded by Mohammed Hanif, Praveen Kalbhavi, Mohammed Jarood, and Shihab Kalandar, was acquired by Blackstone-backed R Systems International last month for Rs 400 crore in cash, and a promise of performance-based stocks.What’s more, MNCs are getting excited about establishing global capability centres (GCCs) in the region. Renowned audio brand Bose Professional recently chose Mangaluru for its first dedicated R&D centre outside its headquarters – to help build the next generation of Bose products. Denmark’s EG, which makes enterprise software and provides cloud services to European companies, and which started a GCC in Mangaluru – called EGDK – in 2019 with less than 20 people, has expanded rapidly in the past few years to 850 people.Big action tended to be in big cities, but these trends are an indication of the opportunities that small towns in India today offer startups and MNCs.Bose Professional CEO John Maier was in Mangaluru last month for the inauguration of their facility. He said the centre was a testament to the region’s burgeoning talent pool, and that it would be a hub for innovation, with a strategic focus on embedded software, apps, and cloud technologies.Talent, as Bhat also noted, is the primary attraction. The region has long been an educational hotspot, driven by high levels of literacy. There are many colleges, some of which really stand out. The National Institute of Technology (NIT) Karnataka is a six-decade-old premier technical institute that produces over 1,000 BTech graduates every year. The Manipal Institute of Technology produces 3,000 BTech graduates and 600 MTech graduates annually. Most of the students at these institutes come from outside the region, making for a very diverse population. And, as Bhat indicates, the students live in an environment made for the Gen Z and Gen Alpha.Many of these institutes have startup incubation programmes. Bhat’s Robosoft emerged out of NITK’s Science and Technology Entrepreneurs’ Park (STEP) established in 1994. The centre has incubated about 80 startups, some of which have grown into multi-crore businesses. Manipal Universal Technology Business Incubator (MUTBI), an initiative of Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE) and established in 2010, has incubated over 50 startups, and graduated nearly 29, the most successful of these being Blackfrog Technologies that’s developing patented tech to enhance immunisation supply chains.Denmark’s EG had entered India through the acquisition of IT firm FrontAvenue InfoSolutions, which had offices in Denmark and Bengaluru. Anand Fernandes, CEO of EGDK India, says initially, postacquisition, there was no plan for expansion in India, and Mangaluru wasn’t even considered. However, the Danish leadership, he says, was swayed by Mangaluru’s quality of life and work-life balance, key aspects of Nordic culture. Mangaluru, he says, also offers a rich tech talent pool, entrepreneurial spirit, and AI-native graduates who can be trained to meet work needs. “Many employees have relocated to Mangaluru, enjoying less traffic, more family time, and excellent educational opportunities for their children,” he says.Even for the Japanese who acquired Niveus, culture played a big role. Suyog Shetty of Niveus says NTT Data was very impressed by the diverse culture and quality of life in the region.Many of those we spoke to also highlighted the lower employee attrition levels in the region as a huge advantage. Bhat notes that attrition in Bengaluru is 20%, while it’s 3-4% in the MangaluruUdupi region. “That’s where the real savings lie, not in salaries,” he says, noting that salaries tend to be almost on par with that in bigger cities. Fernandes notes that lower attrition leads to deeper domain knowledge and stronger team cohesion. Shetty echoes that and adds that it gives clients more confidence, and enables deep-tech work.Indeed, this may be a reason why Robosoft, Niveus and Novigo became so successful. Robosoft, when it was acquired, was one of the best app developers in India. When the iPhone was launched in 2007, five of the 200 or so apps on the App Store on Day 1 were those built by Robosoft. Its customers included Discovery, McDonald’s, Lowe’s, Target, Paytm, Disney, National Geographic and Heineken.There are some issues the region needs to address. Quality office spaces are in short supply. Gurudatta Shenoy, managing partner at realty company Mukund MGM Realty, says Mangaluru’s managed workspace market started only in 2022. But he also notes that it has grown from 300 seats to 3,000 in three years, and more are getting added.The region’s talent lacks exposure to large-scale systems and complex global projects. That kind of experience usually comes from being in bigger ecosystems like Bengaluru. But given the global acquisitions, and GCCs coming in, Mangaluru-Udupi engineers will get more opportunities to work with international customers, collaborate across borders, and manage large, distributed systems.Bhat also warns against repeating Bengaluru’s mistakes. “We must invest in urban planning now. Our slogan is Mangaluru is a 15-minute city (15 minutes to get anywhere). We have to keep it that way. Our main driver is quality of life. If we lose the 15-minute city advantage, the story is over.”",Mangaluru-Manipal-Udupi region has seen two big acquisitions in the past year.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child.

What Nvidia’s investment in xAI may look like





Elon Musk-backed artificial intelligence (AI) company xAI is working on a major fundraising push that could bring in about $20 million– including an equity investment from Nvidia, reports Bloomberg citing people familiar with the matter. Musk launched xAI in 2023 with the goal of building more transparent AI systems that are aligned with human interests. xAI has announced its own AI chatbot Grok which is currently integrated into X.As per the report, Nvidia’s financing may include both equity and debt. It will likely be tied to the Nvidia Graphics Processing Units (GPU) that xAI plans to use in Colossus 2 – largest data centre site located in Memphis. Sources told the publication that Nvidia is investing as much as $2 billion in the equity portion of the deal, a strategy that helps accelerate the chip maker’s customers’ AI investments.According to the report, about $7.5 billion will be raised through equity and as much as $12.5 billion through debt, arranged via a special purpose vehicle (SPV). The SPV will be used to purchase Nvidia processors, which xAI would then rent out for five years. This approach allows Wall Street investors to recover funds while keeping the debt tied to the hardware rather than the company itself. Analysts say the model could serve as a template for other technology firms looking to limit debt exposure.Bloomberg noted that Valor Capital is leading the equity portion of the deal, while Apollo Global Management and Diameter Capital Partners are backing the debt side. Apollo is also participating as an investor.Nvidia, a central supplier in the transaction, has stressed its focus on accelerating AI adoption across industries. At a Goldman Sachs event in September, Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said Nvidia would use its financial strength primarily to support AI deployment, in addition to stock buybacks and strategic acquisitions.",Elon Musk-backed artificial intelligence (AI) company xAI is working on a major fundraising push that could bring in about $20 million– including an equity investment from Nvidia.

What’s fueling the rally?

Who is leading the purchase?

Other assets attracting buyers?





Gold prices touched an all time high on Wednesday, buoyed by safe haven demands, crossing $4,000 per ounce levels.The precious metal jumped to $4,002.95 an ounce,as investors piled amid global economic and political tensions, extending a rally that it has already pushed gold more than 50% since the year starting.""Investors continue to bid up the price of gold, with the precious metal rising more than 50 percent year to date and nearly 12 percent in September alone -- one of the strongest monthly performances on record,"" Richard Flax, chief investment officer at wealth manager Moneyfarm told AFP.Gold’s reputation as a reliable store of value is proving strong in the face of heightened geopolitical and economic uncertainty. The wars in Ukraine and Gaza have pushed many investors to seek security in the metal.At the same time, the United States government shutdown and expectations of more rate cuts from the Federal Reserve have weakened the dollar, making the yellow metal more attractive.Market watchers say worries about the Fed’s independence, following US President Donald Trump’s repeated attacks on the central bank for not cutting rates quickly enough, have also added to the demand.Moreover, growing government debt and uncertainty over tariffs introduced under Trump have made the outlook for other assets less predictable.The World Gold Council (WGC) reported in July that global gold demand rose three percent in the second quarter, reaching 1,249 tonnes. It linked the increase to “an increasingly unpredictable geopolitical environment and price momentum”.Central banks have continued to buy at “significantly elevated levels due to ongoing economic and geopolitical uncertainty”, the WGC said.Exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which give investors exposure to gold without trading futures, have also played a major role.""While early gains this year were driven by tariff-induced volatility in the second quarter, recent momentum has been fuelled by strong sentiment and record inflows into gold-backed exchange-traded funds,"" Flax said.However, rising prices have discouraged some buyers. The WGC noted that jewellery demand has slowed as costs have surged.The gold boom is happening alongside record-breaking performances in other markets. Bitcoin hit a fresh peak of $126,000 on Tuesday, while major stock indices in New York, London and Tokyo have all reached new highs in recent days.Bitcoin’s latest surge comes ""as gold continues its surge, suggesting that investors around the globe continue to look for diversification, though with stocks at record highs too there looks to be plenty of liquidity to go around"", said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at trading platform IG.","Gold prices touched an all time high on Wednesday, buoyed by safe haven demands, crossing $4,000 per ounce levels.

STOCKHOLM: US-based scientists John Clarke, Michel Devoret and John Martinis won the 2025 Nobel Prize in Physics for ""experiments that revealed quantum physics in action"", paving the way for the development of the next generation of digital technologies. ""There is no advanced technology today that does not rely on quantum mechanics,"" Olle Eriksson, chair of the Nobel Committee for Physics, said during the announcement of the award. The laureates' discoveries, he added, paved the way for technologies such as the cellphone, cameras and fiber optic cables.It also helped lay the groundwork for current attempts to build a quantum computer, a device that could compute and process information at speeds that would not be possible with classical computers. The three scientists were recognised for a series of experiments conducted in 1984 and 1985. They proved the existence of two quantum phenomena on a system visible to the human eye.The principles of quantum mechanics describe the strange properties and behaviours of single or small collections of elementary particles. In one such behaviour, called quantum tunnelling, a particle can move through a barrier even if it does not have enough energy to do so.Another property of subatomic particles is that they can emit and absorb energy only in fixed, discrete amounts. This is known as the quantization of energy. With a large number of particles, however, these tiny quantum effects generally become insignificant.The laureates of this year's physics prize showed, for the first time, that quantum tunneling is observable in a system they called macroscopic because it was ""big enough to get one's grubby fingers on,"" according to their paper describing the discovery. They also showed that the energy of this system was quantised, or existed at fixed levels.They made these discoveries by studying a chip with a circuit that was superconducting, meaning it was capable of conducting current with no electrical resistance. As a result, the current was ""trapped"" in a state of flow without any voltage, because it did not have enough energy to escape, according to a summary posted by the Nobel committee, as if behind a barrier that it is unable to cross. The researchers observed the current go from a state of zero voltage to one of non-zero voltage, an observation of quantum tunneling. They also observed that the system only absorbed light of certain frequencies, suggesting that its energy was 'quantised'. The three laureates will share a prize of 11 million Swedish kroner (Rs 10.4 crore).British-born Clarke is a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. Devoret, who was born in France, is a professor at Yale University and the University of California, Santa Barbara, also in the US, where Martinis is also a professor.Two of the three have links with Google . Martinis headed Google's Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab until 2020. Devoret, besides his professorship, is also the chief scientist of Google Quantum AI. It is the second straight year that a Nobel has been won by scientists with Google ties. The 2024 chemistry prize was awarded to Demis Hassabis and John Jumper at Google DeepMind while Geoffrey Hinton, who worked for Google for over a decade, won for physics the same year.","US-based scientists John Clarke, Michel Devoret and John Martinis won the 2025 Nobel Prize in Physics.

Eiffel Tower was almost demolished! Here’s how it was saved and survived over a century,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/eiffel-tower-was-almost-demolished-heres-how-it-was-saved-and-survived-over-a-century/articleshow/124375034.cms,"Image: Pexels

Eiffel Tower’s controversial beginnings

Engineering marvel vs. artistic criticism

Science secures survival





When the Eiffel Tower was first erected for the 1889 World’s Fair in Paris, it faced harsh criticism. Prominent artists and writers labeled it “monstrous” and “useless,” and its creator, Gustave Eiffel, initially received only a 20-year permit to occupy the land. Despite its groundbreaking engineering, many Parisians disliked the structure, fearing it would scar the city’s beauty. Yet Eiffel found a clever way to secure its survival: he transformed the tower into a hub for scientific research and communication. By installing a station at its peak for experiments and radio transmissions, he proved its practical value and ensured it would remain standing long after the World’s Fair ended.The idea for the Eiffel Tower originated in 1884 when engineers Emile Nouguier and Maurice Koechlin, working for Eiffel, envisioned an iron lattice tower. They wanted to build a vertical spectacle that would demonstrate the possibilities of modern iron construction and celebrate France’s industrial and technological achievements. After securing a patent and winning a competition for the 1889 World’s Fair centerpiece, construction began in January 1887 and concluded in March 1889.Despite its rapid completion, the project faced public backlash. A letter signed by writers, artists, and architects—including Guy de Maupassant and Charles Garnier—called the tower a “tragic street lamp” and “Tower of Babel,” reflecting fears that it would ruin Paris’ aesthetic charm.The tower’s design sparked debate over whether it represented true architecture or pure engineering. Critics objected to its exposed iron frame and massive base, while Eiffel argued that elegance could exist within engineering. Initially adorned with decorative Gothic elements, many were later removed, leaving the stark lattice structure. Over time, public opinion shifted as visitors marveled at unprecedented panoramic views of Paris from its heights, demonstrating the tower’s unique attraction.Eiffel ensured the tower’s long-term survival by dedicating its top to scientific experimentation. Atmospheric studies and other research took place at the summit, giving the tower functional value beyond mere aesthetics. In 1898, it became a radio transmission site, and by 1908, experiments transmitted signals over thousands of miles. These scientific uses proved crucial in gaining a 70-year extension on Eiffel’s permit, effectively saving the structure from demolition.","The Eiffel Tower was built for the 1889 World’s Fair in Paris.

""The Nobel Assembly at Sweden’s Karolinska Institute announced the award on Monday, recognising the trio for their pioneering work that laid the foundation for understanding autoimmune diseases and opened new avenues for cancer and immunotherapy research.Their discovery understood how the immune system is kept in check. They noted that, ""the body’s powerful immune system must be regulated, or it may attack our own organs.""The Nobel Prize laureates have reshaped modern immunology and identified ""the immune system’s security guards, regulatory T cells, thus laying the foundation for a new field of research. The discoveries have also led to the development of potential medical treatments that are now being evaluated in clinical trials,"" a release stated.Their research showed that when these cells fail to function properly, the body becomes vulnerable to autoimmune diseases, where the immune system turns against itself.""The hope is to be able to treat or cure autoimmune diseases, provide more effective cancer treatments and prevent serious complications after stem cell transplants,"" it noted.The work of Brunkow and Ramsdell gained prominence in 2001 when they uncovered the genetic cause behind a specific strain of mice known as “scurfy” that were highly susceptible to autoimmune diseases.Earlier in 2024 Nobel prize in Physiology/Medicine was awarded to Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun for the discovery of microRNA and its role in post-transcriptional gene regulation.Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun's groundbreaking discovery revealed a completely new principle of gene regulation that turned out to be essential for multicellular organisms, including humans.The announcement marks the beginning of Nobel Prize week, with awards in physics, chemistry, literature, peace, and economic sciences to follow.","The 2025 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine has been awarded to Mary E.
