Srinagar snowfall disrupts flight services; IndiGo issues advisory,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/srinagar-snowfall-disrupts-flight-services-indigo-issues-advisory/articleshow/127222033.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: Flight operations at Srinagar were temporarily suspended on Friday due to snowfall, with both arrivals and departures put on hold.In an advisory to passengers, the airline said the suspension could lead to extended wait times, both onboard aircraft and at the airport, as weather conditions continued to affect operations. It added that boarding formalities may be completed in advance so that flights can depart immediately once clearance is granted.The airline said it was closely monitoring the situation and assured passengers that efforts were being made to minimise inconvenience. Travellers have been advised to check the latest status of their flights before heading to the airport, as operations will resume only after weather conditions improve.Cold conditions tightened their grip across Kashmir on Thursday as minimum temperatures dipped further at most locations, with officials warning that an approaching western disturbance could bring fresh snowfall later in the day.Night temperatures fell below the freezing point across the valley. In Srinagar, the minimum temperature dropped by one degree from the previous night to settle at minus 3.4 degrees Celsius on Wednesday night.The coldest spot in the valley was Sonamarg in central Kashmir’s Ganderbal district, where the mercury plunged to minus 6.1 degrees Celsius, compared to minus 5.5 degrees Celsius a night earlier. North Kashmir’s ski resort of Gulmarg recorded a minimum of minus 4 degrees Celsius.In south Kashmir, Pahalgam, which also serves as a base camp for the annual Amarnath Yatra, registered a low of minus 4.4 degrees Celsius, down from minus 3.8 degrees Celsius the previous night.Officials said Qazigund recorded a minimum of minus 3.8 degrees Celsius, while Kokernag settled at minus 2.6 degrees Celsius and Kupwara at minus 3.7 degrees Celsius.According to the meteorological department, two strong western disturbances are expected to affect Jammu and Kashmir this week. The first system is likely to impact the region on Thursday, followed by another on January 26. Under their influence, widespread light to moderate rainfall and snowfall, including in the plains of the Kashmir Valley, is forecast, with peak activity expected on January 23 and January 27.","Flight operations at Srinagar were temporarily suspended on Friday due to snowfall.

"Patent rejected for MNC’s cancer drug, generics to follow",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/patent-rejected-for-mncs-cancer-drug-generics-to-follow/articleshow/127206094.cms,"Image: IANS

NEW DELHI: In what could be good news for patients, Indian Patent Office (IPO) has rejected MNC AbbVie’s patent application for its blockbuster cancer drug Venetoclax citing lack of inventive step. AbbVie markets the drug under the brand, Venclexta, in India. The company holds another patent on a composition of Venclexta, which is facing opposition in courts.IPO’s Delhi office declined to grant a patent on Venetoclax used in treatment of certain blood cancers, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia. The decision, if not challenged, paves way for entry of affordable generics in country, legal experts told TOI. The application faced sustained opposition at pre-grant stage, with seven parties filing challenges between 2018 and 2025. The patent office held that the claimed invention was “obvious” and lacked inventive step, a violation of Section 3(d) of Indian Patent Act.Section 3(d) bars patents on new forms or derivatives of known substances unless they demonstrate a significant enhancement in therapeutic efficacy, a provision aimed at preventing “evergreening” of pharmaceutical patents.It is the same provision under which Swiss firm Novartis lost patent on its blockbuster cancer drug, Glivec, in 2013. The order, accessed by TOI, said “claims of complete specification is not patentable under the Act, does not describe the invention”, and added it offered “no enhancement in therapeutic efficiency”, and hence, is a case of evergreening.Further, applicants have failed to give data of better therapeutic efficacy of compounds claimed in the present application over compounds disclosed in the prior art document, it added. “In absence of any biological data for all claimed compounds in the present specification, it cannot be decided whether the claims actually have the claimed anti-cancer activity or not. Hence, applicants have completely failed to establish any pharmacological activity and/or therapeutic efficacy for all the millions of claimed compounds,” the order said.","Indian Patent Office (IPO) has rejected MNC AbbVie’s patent application for its blockbuster cancer drug Venetoclax.

"HC: Apart from refunds, how will you compensate flyers?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hc-apart-from-refunds-how-will-you-compensate-flyers/articleshow/127204742.cms,"ANI file photo

NEW DELHI: Delhi high court directed IndiGo on Thursday to clarify how it intended to compensate flyers affected by the mayhem of cancellations last Dec, saying issuing refunds wasn’t quite the same as doing right by those who bore the brunt of the crisis.“Apart from refunding fares, what are the civil aviation rules for compensation? Please file an affidavit about compensation,” the bench of Chief Justice D K Upadhyaya and Justice Tejas Karia told the counsel for the airline after he informed that the carrier had processed refunds for cancelled flights.The counsel submitted that for flights that were “most severely impacted”, IndiGo was offering vouchers worth Rs 10,000 to each passenger. He said a website has been set up for them to claim compensation. “You know who the flyers are; why do they need to claim compensation?” the bench responded. “Anyway, you file an affidavit to this effect in two weeks.”The court was hearing a PIL by advocates Akhil Rana and Utkarsh Sharma, seeking directions to Centre to provide support and refunds to passengers affected by cancellation of hundreds of flights by IndiGo during that period.They argued that compensation must be in the form of money instead of vouchers.The petitioners pointed out that IndiGo had issued travel vouchers to stranded passengers with a time limit for utilisation. When the airline’s counsel said the vouchers were valid for 12 months, the judges noted the time frame appeared reasonable. They sought to know if there were options for flyers who did not use the vouchers within that period.Civil aviation ministry and DGCA informed the court that steps have been taken by authorities to prevent a recurrence of the crisis.Based on the inquiry committee’s report, IndiGo’s senior vice-president for operations was asked to step down, and a penalty of Rs 22 crore was slapped on the airline for its failure to adhere to the new flight roster norms, Centre’s counsel said.He said the airline was directed to furnish a bank guarantee of Rs 50 crore to ensure compliance with regulatory directions and long-term systemic corrections, while warnings had been issued to the chief operating officer, director, deputy head of flight operations and a resource analyst.The inquiry report was submitted to court in a sealed cover. Between Dec 3 and 5, IndiGo cancelled 2,507 flights while 1,852 were delayed, impacting over three lakh passengers across country. The inquiry found out that the airline was not adequately prepared to implement the new flight duty norms for pilots.",Delhi high court directed IndiGo to clarify how it intended to compensate flyers affected by the mayhem of cancellations last Dec.

Silver market jitters: ETFs see steep 20% drop; what’s causing the sudden drop?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/silver-market-jitters-etfs-see-steep-20-drop-whats-causing-the-sudden-drop/articleshow/127124650.cms,"Representative image

Indian silver exchange-traded funds (ETFs) witnessed a sharp sell-off on Thursday, plunging up to 20% in early trade as investors rushed to exit amid heightened volatility in precious metals.The steep fall wiped out the unusually high premium at which these ETFs were trading compared to international prices and physical silver markets.Nippon India Silver ETF, ICICI Prudential Silver ETF and Kotak Silver ETF fell between 19% and 20% during morning trade.As per ET, the funds slipped below their indicative net asset values (iNAVs), turning what was earlier a steep premium into a discount. The sell-off was largely limited to ETFs, highlighting the risks associated with sharp price dislocations in these products.In contrast, silver prices in other markets saw relatively modest declines. Global spot silver was trading around $92.27 an ounce, just days after touching a record high of $95.87 earlier this week.On the domestic front, MCX March silver futures slipped about 2% in morning trade, far less severe than the ETF correction.Market experts pointed to extreme volatility as a key factor behind the move. Manoj Kumar Jain of Prithvi Finmart said investors should avoid fresh positions in precious metals for now.“We are experiencing very high price volatility in both precious metals,” Jain was quoted as saying by ET, advising traders to wait for stability.The correction came as global risk appetite improved and the US dollar strengthened, reducing demand for safe-haven assets.Sentiment also eased after US President Donald Trump ruled out using military force over Greenland and signalled restraint on tariffs against European nations.Despite the turbulence, some analysts remain constructive on silver’s broader outlook. Ponmudi R, CEO of Enrich Money, said COMEX silver remains firm near $92–$93, supported by strong industrial demand and tight global supply.However, he cautioned that near-term swings could remain sharp, especially in ETF prices, given their tendency to trade at premiums or discounts during volatile phases.(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own.

SRINAGAR: Kashmir Valley and Pir Panjal regions in J&K may witness major snowfall from early Friday, with India Meteorological Department (IMD), Srinagar, forecasting that back-to-back western disturbances will impact the region’s weather pattern for almost a week.Authorities have stepped up preparedness at the district level. Kulgam Deputy Commissioner Athar Aamir Khan said as a precautionary measure, 232 pregnant women expected to deliver in the district this week had already been hospitalised to ensure uninterrupted medical care during the harsh winter spell.With a rainfall deficit of 96% this month, J&K has witnessed an arid winter, leading to forest fires and the drying up of rivers and streams. IMD Srinagar director Mukhtar Ahmad on Thursday said weather conditions would change early Friday onwards, with moderate to heavy rainfall and heavy snowfall likely in parts of south Kashmir. North Kashmir may see moderate to heavy snow.Ahmad warned that the weather situation would disrupt traffic and trigger landslides on major highways, including Srinagar–Leh highway; Mughal Road, which connects Kashmir Valley to Poonch district in Jammu division, and Razdan Pass, a high-altitude mountain pass connecting north Kashmir’s Bandipora district with the scenic Gurez Valley on the LoC.The changing weather conditions could also affect air traffic on Friday, Ahmad said, adding that high-altitude areas — including Zojila Pass, Gulmarg and parts of Kupwara — were expected to receive two to three feet of snowfall.With another western disturbance likely to affect the region from Jan 26, Ahmad advised farmers to postpone agricultural activities till Jan 28. He said light rain was expected on Jan 24-25, and another active phase will commence from Jan 26 when moderate rain and snowfall was expected at most places across Kashmir Valley.J&K traffic department issued an advisory urging people to plan travel carefully. It requested commuters to confirm road conditions with traffic control units in Srinagar, Ramban and Jammu before embarking on the journey. Passengers and light motor vehicle operators were advised to use Jammu–Srinagar NH only during daytime, with night travel discouraged due to the risk of shooting stones and landslides.",Kashmir Valley and Pir Panjal regions in J&K may witness major snowfall from early Friday.

Delhi excise policy probe: Court acquits Arvind Kejriwal in ED summons case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-excise-policy-probe-court-acquits-arvind-kejriwal-in-ed-summons-case/articleshow/127155161.cms,"Arvind Kejriwal (PTI file photo)

NEW DELHI: A Delhi court on Thursday acquitted former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in two cases filed by the Enforcement Directorate over his failure to appear before the agency in the Delhi excise policy probe.The order was passed by additional chief judicial magistrate Paras Dalal at the Rouse Avenue Courts. The Enforcement Directorate had approached the court in February 2024, seeking action against Kejriwal for not complying with summons issued under Section 50 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. The agency said Kejriwal had not appeared despite being summoned five times in connection with its investigation.The money laundering probe stems from a case registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation on August 17, 2022, over alleged irregularities in the Delhi excise policy for 2021–22.The CBI case was based on a complaint filed by Delhi Lieutenant Governor VK Saxena on July 20, 2022. Following this, the ED registered its own case on August 22, 2022, to investigate the money laundering angle.Kejriwal was later arrested in the main excise policy case.He was eventually granted bail by the Supreme Court.The excise policy was scrapped in 2022 after lieutenant governor ordered a CBI probe into alleged irregularities and corruption involving its formulation and execution. According to CBI and ED, irregularities were committed while modifying the excise policy, and undue favours were extended to licence holders.AAP MLA Amanatullah Khan was also acquitted on Thursday in one case and discharged in another related to his alleged non-compliance with summons issued by the Enforcement Directorate in the Delhi Waqf Board Money laundering case.","A Delhi court on Thursday acquitted former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.

'They Exist Because Of Pakistan': Canadian Journalist Exposes Brutal Truth About Khalistan Movement

NEW DELHI: Members of terrorist group Sikhs For Justice (SFJ) trespassed and vandalised Indian embassy in Zagreb and tried to replace the Tricolour with a ""Khalistan flag"", drawing strong condemnation from Indian govt.Govt on Thursday said it had raised the issue with Croatian authorities both here and in the Croatian capital and asked them to bring the perpetrators to justice. ""We condemn the incident of trespassing and vandalism at our embassy in Zagreb, Croatia, by anti-India elements,"" said MEA in a statement, adding under Vienna Convention, diplomatic premises are inviolable and must be protected.It said such actions also speak of the character and motives of those behind them, and law enforcement authorities everywhere would do well to take note of them. ""Accordingly, we have taken up the matter strongly with Croatian authorities, both in New Delhi and in Zagreb, and asked them to hold the perpetrators accountable for their reprehensible and illegal actions,"" said the ministry.Looking to target India ahead of its Republic Day, the separatists tried to take down the Indian flag and replace it with a ""Khalistan flag"". They also raised anti-India slogans. This was one of the few occasions where the separatists targeted an Indian mission outside of the ""five eyes countries"" - US, Canada, UK, Australia, and New Zealand - where they are mostly based.India has been looking to ramp up its ties with Croatia, a member of EU, and PM Modi had visited the country last year on his way back to India from G7 summit in Canada.In a statement, SFJ claimed the act was timed to coincide with the lead-up to Republic Day. ""Ahead of EU leaders' participation in Republic Day, Indian Tricolour was removed and destroyed, while Khalistan flag was raised at the Indian embassy in Zagreb, Croatia..."" SFJ chief Gurpatwant Singh Pannun said.Continuing his anti-India rhetoric, Pannun claimed that the act was the first such incident in past 40 years.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Thursday fast-tracked proceedings on the legal dispute over the religious character of the Bhojshala Saraswati Temple cum Maulana Kamal Maula Mosque in Dhar in Madhya Pradesh which has been a bone of contention between the Hindu and Muslim communities, lifting the stay it had ordered on the case pending with MP high court.The court also decoupled it from the larger issue of a challenge to Places of Worship Act. In the meantime, SC allowed Hindu and Muslim communities to perform Basant Panchami and Friday prayers respectively within the compound in separate demarcated areas.As Saraswati Puja will be celebrated on a Friday this year, a bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant, Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul Pancholi appealed to both communities to show tolerance and mutual respect while holding their prayers and also cooperate with the district administration to maintain law and order in the area.With the Hindu side pleading with the court that they should be allowed to hold puja throughout the day as Saraswati puja is a day-long ritual and the Muslim side saying Juma Namaz can happen only between 12.30 pm and 3.00 pm, the bench decided to allow them to perform their rituals at the same time in the compound but in different corners. The court passed the order after additional solicitor general K M Nataraj, appearing for the state, assured that all necessary arrangements would be put in place to maintain law and order.The bench then asked senior advocate Salman Khurshid, appearing for the Muslim side, to brief the state govt on the number of people who would be offering namaz on Friday so that proper arrangements could be made. The court clarified that the namaz would be allowed between 1pm and 3pm while Basant Panchmi celebrations would be allowed all day.“A fair suggestion was given that in the afternoon, for namaz within 1pm and 3pm, an exclusive and separate area within the same compound, including separate ingress and egress within the same compound, shall be made available so that namaz can be performed. Similarly, a separate space shall be made available to the Hindu community to hold traditional ceremonies on the occasion of Basant Panchami... Administration may, with a view to ensure the maintenance of law and order, issue passes for the visitors or may adopt any other fair means to ensure that no untoward incident happens,” the bench said. “We appeal to both sides to observe mutual respect and trust towards each other.”The 11th century monument is at the centre of a dispute between Hindus and Muslims. Hindus believe it is a temple of goddess Vagdevi, an incarnation of goddess Saraswati, while the Muslim community calls it the Kamal Maula mosque.Advocates Vishnu Jain and Ashwini Upadhyay, appearing for Hindu side, pleaded with the court to expedite the hearing in Madhya Pradesh high court where the case arising from the dispute over religious character of Bhojshala Saraswati Temple cum Maulana Kamal Maula Mosque, has been pending. They told the court that proceedings in the case were not moving forward because of the apex court’s stay order even though the Archaeological Society of India (ASI) had filed its report in a sealed envelope.The bench thereafter asked the HC that the case be taken up by a division bench preferably headed by the Chief Justice or senior most judge and by opening the sealed envelope. It directed that the report be unsealed in open court and a copy to it be given to both sides. “Till the writ is finally decided, the parties shall maintain the status quo at the site,” the court said.","The 11th century monument is at the centre of a dispute between Hindus and Muslims.

14 Naxals Neutralized In Sukma And Bijapur As Security Forces Launch Anti-Maoist Operation

NEW DELHI: 16 Maoists were killed in a major gunfight with security forces during Operation Megaburu in Jharkhand’s West Singhbhum district. Top CPI (Maoist) leader Patiram Manjhi alias Anal Da, carrying a cumulative bounty of over Rs 2.35 crore, was among those killed.The encounter took place during a joint operation by the CRPF and Jharkhand Police in the Saranda forest area, one of the last Maoist strongholds in the state. Among those killed were five women and several senior leaders of the banned outfit.Giving details, union home minister Amit Shah said that the operation marked a significant breakthrough in the Centre’s push to eliminate Left-wing extremism.In a post on X, he wrote: “Today, in West Singhbhum, the ongoing joint operation by CRPF and Jharkhand Police has achieved a major success in the campaign to make the region free of Naxals, with the neutralisation of the notorious bounty-wanted Naxal Central Committee member ‘Anal alias Patiram Manjhi’… and 15 other Naxals so far.”Anal Da was carrying a total bounty of Rs 2.35 crore: Rs 1 crore announced by Jharkhand, Rs 1.2 crore by Odisha and Rs 15 lakh by the NIA.A resident of Giridih district, he had been active since 1987 and was involved in several high-profile attacks. This includes the 2006 assault on a CISF camp in Bokaro that killed five personnel, the killing of five security personnel in Seraikela-Kharswan in 2019 and the theft of five tonnes of explosives in Odisha in May 2025.Shah reiterated the government’s resolve to end Naxalism by March 31 this year and appealed to remaining Maoists to surrender.“We are committed to eradicating Naxalism, which has been synonymous with fear and terror for decades. I once again appeal to the remaining Naxals to abandon the ideology that connects to violence, terror, and arms, and join the mainstream of development and trust,” he said.Officials said around 1,500 personnel of the CRPF’s elite CoBRA unit were involved in the operation, codenamed Operation Megaburu, in the Kumdi area under Kiriburu police station limits. The exchange of fire began on Thursday morning following specific intelligence inputs about the presence of Anal Da and his squad.CRPF Inspector General Saket Kumar Singh said bodies of the Maoists had been recovered from the encounter site.“We have recovered the bodies of Maoists, including their top leader Patiram Manjhi alias Anal Da carrying a bounty of Rs 2.35 crore on his head. Eleven bodies have been identified and identification of the remaining four Maoists is underway,” he said. Singh added that this was the highest number of Maoist bodies recovered in a single encounter in Jharkhand.Singh also said that barring Misir Besra, all central committee members of CPI (Maoist) in Jharkhand have now been eliminated. “Only around 60–65 Maoists are left in the state, mostly confined to Singhbhum. The last round of battle is going on and we will end this soon,” he said, urging remaining cadres to surrender or face consequences.Another senior Maoist killed was Bihar-Jharkhand Special Area Committee member Anmol alias Sushant, who was wanted in 149 cases and carried a Rs 90 lakh reward.Other slain cadres included regional committee member Amit Munda, sub-zonal committee members Pintu Lohar and Laljeet alias Lalu and several area committee members.Inspector General of Police (Operations) Michael Raj S said five of the Maoists killed were women. Senior CRPF officials, including Director General Gyanendra Pratap Singh, had reviewed the situation in Chaibasa earlier this week.Reacting to the development, BJP leader and Jharkhand opposition leader Babulal Marandi termed it a major success against “red terror.”In a post on X, he said, “All the personnel involved in this operation have demonstrated indomitable courage, valor, and dedication to duty… the Central Government is steadfastly moving forward with the resolve to eradicate Naxalism from its roots by March 2026.”According to official data, between 2001 and 2025, more than 11,000 Maoists have been arrested, around 250 killed and over 350 surrendered before security forces across Jharkhand.","Top CPI (Maoist) leader Patiram Manjhi alias Anal Da, carrying a cumulative bounty of over Rs 2.35 crore, was among those killed. The encounter took place during a joint operation by the CRPF and Jharkhand Police in the Saranda forest area.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127178820,imgsize-1572220,width-400,resizemode-4/127178820.jpg"
India’s hi-voltage transmission network crosses 5 lakh ckm mark,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-hi-voltage-transmission-network-crosses-5-lakh-ckm-mark/articleshow/127177524.cms,"Yogi's Davos Push: Uttar Pradesh Signs Landmark MoU For One Gigawatt Green AI Hub In Greater Noida

NEW DELHI: Amid concerns over inadequacy of the grid to evacuate power from renewable energy projects, the govt on Thursday said that India’s high-voltage (220 kV and above) power transmission network had crossed the 5 lakh circuit kilometre (ckm) mark with the addition of 628 ckm in Rajasthan earlier this month.With India targeting 500 gigawatt (GW) of renewable energy capacity by 2030, strengthening the high-voltage inter- and intra-state transmission network is crucial for evacuating green energy and ensuring grid stability. Sources said the govt has planned to expand the high-voltage transmission network to 6.5 lakh ckm by 2032. It has added 2.1 lakh ckm since April 2014. However, it failed to achieve the annual target in the 2024–25 financial year and the figure has been considerably short of target in the ongoing fiscal as well.Officials said that in FY25, only 8,830 ckm of new transmission lines were commissioned, as against a target of 15,253 ckm, reflecting a 42% shortfall, while 6,961 ckm have been added till Dec, as against a target of 15,382 ckm for FY26.According to officials, the world’s largest synchronous national grid crossed the 5 lakh ckm milestone on Jan 14 with the commissioning of a 765-kV transmission line for evacuation of 1,100 MW of green energy from Bhadla, Ramgarh and Fatehgarh solar power complex in the Rajasthan renewable energy zone.The ministry of power, in a statement, said that 40,000 ckm of transmission network is currently being built under inter-state transmission projects, while 27,500 ckm of intra-state transmission projects are under implementation. These are expected to enhance grid reliability and power evacuation capability. While transformation capacity has increased to 1,407 gigavolt ampere (GVA), officials said it is expected to reach 2,345 GVA by 2032.A senior power department official said further strengthening of the transmission network is among the key issues being discussed at a two-day ‘chintan shivir’, a brainstorming session of ministers and senior officials from the Union ministry and state power departments and related public sector undertakings, which began on Thursday at Parwanoo in Himachal Pradesh. Officials said the financial health of power discoms, the final draft of the Electricity Amendment Bill, installation of smart meters, challenges in the generation sector, energy goals and security and new technologies will also be discussed at the Shivir.Nearly 65 state-run and private power distribution companies posted a combined PAT (profit after tax) of ₹2,700 crore in FY25. However, officials said that ₹6.9 lakh crore of accumulated losses and nearly ₹7.2 lakh crore of outstanding debt remain a major cause for concern and will come up for discussion, along with high cross-subsidies, the need for cost-reflective tariffs and improvements in billing and recovery efficiency.Ministers and officials are also likely to discuss comments received from various stakeholders on the draft Electricity Amendment Bill, which is expected to be tabled in Parliament during the upcoming Budget session.","India’s high-voltage (220 kV and above) power transmission network had crossed the 5 lakh circuit kilometre (ckm) mark with the addition of 628 ckm in Rajasthan earlier this month.

NEW DELHI: Election Commission on Thursday defended its decision to carry out a Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in the Supreme Court and asked it to dismiss petitions challenging the process in Bihar.Appearing for the poll panel, senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi told the bench of chief justice Surya Kant and justice Joymalya Bagchithat that the exercise was “fair, just and reasonable”, and a “roving and fishing enquiry” into the revision could not be allowed at the instance of a few NGOs and politicians.“None of the 66 lakh persons, whose names were deleted in Bihar SIR, came to this court or high court or filed pleas with the Election Commission,” the poll panel argued.The commission said it invoked its powers under Section 21(3) of the 1950 Act, the manner of conducting a special revision was left to its discretion. “There is no compulsion under Section 21(3) that every SIR must be identical in nature,” it said, adding that the provision operates independently of routine revisions under Section 21(2).EC further said that Bihar had not seen an SIR for nearly 20 years and the exercise was needed due to changing demographics, including urbanisation and population movement.The chief justice, however, observed that if the Election Commission’s claim of unfettered discretion under Section 21(3) was accepted, “the case would end there”.EC also relied on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003, saying it introduced stricter requirements to establish citizenship.Justice Bagchi questioned whether the amended citizenship law was the trigger for the present SIR, pointing out that the Election Commission’s order did not refer to cross-border or illegal migration. “The word ‘migration’ ordinarily refers to lawful movement. Inter-state migration is a constitutional right,” the judge said.EC replied that the amendment had not been operationalised earlier and that the current SIR offered a chance to account for the changed legal framework.",Election Commission on Thursday defended its decision to carry out a Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in the Supreme Court.

Bihar Assembly Poll Results: NDA Touches 200-Seat Lead, Congress Intensifies SIR, Vote Chori Attacks

Is Bihar really a win for women?

14% represent the 50%

Women in Politics: 2025

Are men still writing laws?

The Bihar Assembly elections were widely celebrated as a democratic milestone. With an overall voter turnout of 66.91%, the highest since 1951, and women turning out in unprecedented numbers, the state appeared to signal a quiet transformation.Female voter turnout stood at an impressive 71.6%, far surpassing male turnout at 62.8%. On the surface, this looked like a clear victory for women’s political participation. But a closer look at who actually wields power in Bihar raises uncomfortable questions about whether this enthusiasm translated into real political gains.Despite women driving the electoral surge, representation in the Assembly remains limited. Of the 243 elected MLAs, only 29 are women, just under 12%. This mirrors a long-standing pattern: women show up decisively at the ballot box but struggle to cross the gatekeeping barriers of party nominations and electoral success.The picture becomes even starker in the executive. The Nitish Kumar cabinet has only three women ministers out of 27, amounting to just 11%. In effect, women voters powered a historic election, but men continue to dominate the institutions that shape policy and governance.The candidate landscape explains part of this imbalance. According to ADR data, only 254 women, around 10% of all candidates, contested the 2025 Bihar elections, compared to 2,344 men. This figure has barely changed from the 2020 elections, where women also made up just 10% of candidates. Structural exclusion at the nomination stage ensures that even high voter turnout cannot significantly alter outcomes. Representation of the third gender remains almost nonexistent, with only two candidates contesting.""Once the Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam is implemented, parties will have to give tickets to women. That is how women’s representation has increased in other countries,"" said Zoya Hasan, Professor Emerita, Jawaharlal Nehru University.Equally troubling is the quality of political choices on offer. Ninety-four candidates declared cases related to crimes against women, including five accused of rape. That such candidates continue to secure tickets highlights the disconnect between women’s electoral participation and the political system’s responsiveness to women’s safety and dignity.The parliamentary numbers reveal the scale of democratic under-representation women continue to face. While women constitute nearly half the population, they occupy only about 14% of seats in the Lok Sabha. The journey has been one of slow and incremental change. In 1957, women made up just 3% of candidates contesting general elections; by 2024, that figure had risen to 10%. Electoral success has improved, but modestly. From 22 women in the First Lok Sabha and 27 in the Second, the number increased to 78 in the 17th Lok Sabha and stands at 75 in the 18th—still a fraction of proportional representation.The Rajya Sabha shows a similar pattern. Women members increased from 15 in 1952 to 42 today, accounting for around 17% of the Upper House. These gains, while notable, underline how access to Parliament remains structurally limited for women, especially when compared to their electoral participation and demographic weight.In 2023, India took a significant legislative step toward addressing gender imbalance in politics with the passage of the Constitution (One Hundred and Sixth Amendment) Act, popularly known as the. The law mandates the rotational reservation of one-third of seats for women in the Lok Sabha and all State Legislative Assemblies, including that of the National Capital Territory of Delhi. Framed as a historic corrective to decades of underrepresentation, the amendment seeks to institutionalise women’s presence in legislative decision-making across the federal structure.However, the reform’s impact remains deferred. The legislation is scheduled to come into force only after the publication of the next national census, the timing of which is yet to be announced. Once implemented, the reservation will remain in effect for 15 years. Notably, the amendment excludes the Rajya Sabha, India’s upper house of Parliament, where women currently account for just 13% of members, underscoring the partial nature of the intervention.At the time the bill was passed, women constituted around 14% of the Lok Sabha, the highest proportion since Independence but still well below global benchmarks. According to a United Nations report, the global average for women’s representation in national parliaments stood at 26.5%, while Central and Southern Asia averaged 19%, highlighting India’s lag despite incremental gains.""Panchayats operate at a different level of governance altogether; the logic that has enabled proxy representation or Pradhan-Patis there cannot be transposed to higher legislatures,"" Hasan said.Hasan further noted that the ""political arena"" in which the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha function is ""fundamentally different, leaving little scope for phenomena such as 'MP-patis.'""India has about 14.5 lakh elected women representatives in Panchayati Raj Institutions, forming nearly 46% of all local representatives, an achievement unmatched globally. Twenty-one states have gone further, reserving 50% of PRI seats for women, exceeding the constitutional minimum of 33%. Yet this grassroots success has not translated upward, reinforcing a paradox at the heart of Indian democracy: women lead locally but remain marginal nationally.Recent global assessments suggest that progress has not only stalled but slightly reversed. The Global Gender Gap Report 2025 ranks India 131st, with an overall gender parity score of 64.4%, a drop of three places from the previous year. Political empowerment remains a key area of concern.Female representation in Parliament declined from 14.7% to 13.8% in 2025, while the share of women in ministerial positions fell from 6.5% to 5.6%—continuing a downward trend from the 2019 peak. Against this backdrop, the women’s reservation law represents both a long-awaited promise and a test of political will, with its eventual implementation likely to shape India’s gender parity trajectory in the years ahead.Despite decades of advocacy and incremental reform, women remain significantly underrepresented in political power structures across the world.Themap, released by the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) and UN Women, offers a snapshot of the global gender gap in political leadership as of January 1, 2025, underscoring how male dominance in decision-making continues to slow progress toward political equality.According to the data, women serve as heads of state or government in just 25 countries, reflecting the narrow reach of female leadership at the highest executive levels. In national legislatures, women account for 27.2 per cent of MPs worldwide—an improvement over previous decades, but still far from parity. The imbalance is even more pronounced within executive branches: globally, fewer than one in four cabinet ministers are women, with women holding only 22.9% of such positions.The distribution of power within cabinets further highlights structural inequities. While women are more likely to be assigned portfolios related to human rights, gender equality, and social protection, men overwhelmingly control ministries that shape national security and economic direction, including foreign affairs, finance, home affairs, and defence. This gendered division of political labour reinforces longstanding hierarchies, limiting women’s influence over core policy domains.Findings from the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) and UN Women, released in early 2025, showed that men continued to dominate political leadership worldwide, despite three decades having passed since the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action laid out a global roadmap for women’s rights.At the start of 2025, men outnumbered women by more than three to one across executive and legislative positions. Women’s representation in national parliaments had inched up only marginally, reaching just over a quarter of all lawmakers globally. In contrast, women’s presence in government roles moved in the opposite direction, reflecting how gains in legislatures have not consistently translated into executive power.Female political leadership at the highest level remained the exception rather than the norm. Only a small number of countries were led by women, with Europe accounting for the largest share. While 2024 marked several historic firsts, more than half the world’s countries had still never had a woman head of state or government.Hasan pointed out that one of the reasons behind rise in female representation in politics in Europe and the States, has been their increased representation in decision-making roles within political parties.""In Europe and the United States, efforts to increase women’s representation in legislatures have followed a two-pronged approach. One strategy has focused on enhancing women’s presence in decision-making roles within political parties, which in turn has contributed to a rise in the number of women parliamentarians,"" the JNU professor noted.Cabinet-level representation offered a similarly mixed picture. Fewer than one in four cabinet ministers globally were women, and the number of countries with gender-equal cabinets had declined compared to the previous year. Regional disparities were stark, with Europe and the Americas showing higher levels of representation, while large parts of Asia, Central Asia and the Pacific continued to record very low participation by women in executive leadership.","The Bihar Assembly elections were widely celebrated as a democratic milestone. Despite women driving the electoral surge, representation in the Assembly remains limited. The Nitish Kumar cabinet has only three women ministers out of 27, amounting to just 11%.

PM Modi Flags Off India’s First Vande Bharat Sleeper Train Between Howrah-Guwahati In Bengal

NEW DELHI: West Bengal’s ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) on Thursday accused the BJP-led Centre and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of policing people's plates after the newly launched Vande Bharat sleeper train between Kolkata and Kamakhya offered only vegetarian food.The party alleged that the absence of non-vegetarian options on a route linking regions where fish and meat are staple foods reflected an attempt to impose uniform food habits.In a post on X, the party wrote: “First they policed our votes. Now they’re policing our plates”.Referring to the recent flag-off of the Vande Bharat sleeper service by PM Modi, the TMC said the Centre had highlighted the new train for Bengal but had not disclosed changes to its food offerings.“Just days ago, PM Modi was busy boasting about giving Bengal a new Vande Bharat sleeper train. What he didn’t mention however is that on the Vande Bharat train running from Bengal to Assam, fish and meat have been taken off the menu,” the party wrote.Pointing to the cultural significance of non-vegetarian food in both West Bengal and Assam, the TMC said, “A train connecting two regions where people cherish non-vegetarian food now offers only vegetarian options.”The party described the move as part of what it called a larger ideological pattern, saying it reflected “the natural extension of a mindset” that seeks to impose uniformity.In its post, the TMC cited earlier incidents to underline its criticism, including remarks allegedly made about fish-eating Bengalis, restrictions on fish in parts of Delhi and the assault of a street vendor for selling chicken patties.“The Prime Minister derides fish-eating Bengalis as ‘Mughals’. Diktats are issued banning fish in Delhi. A poor street vendor is brutally assaulted for selling chicken patties. Today it’s what we eat. Tomorrow it’s what we wear. Who we love. How we live. What we’re witnessing is the ‘Banchte Chai, BJP Tai’ model, where Bengalis are pushed into submission by Bangla-Birodhi Zamindars imposing monolithic, homogenised identities on our plural ethos,” the party further wrote.Reiterating its opposition to what it termed cultural imposition, the TMC added, “Bengal will not take lessons on identity from those who neither understand nor respect it.”The criticism comes days after Prime Minister Modi flagged off India’s first Vande Bharat sleeper train on January 17 from Malda town in West Bengal. The semi-high-speed, fully air-conditioned train is designed for overnight travel and aims to improve connectivity between eastern India and the Northeast.According to the Ministry of Railways, the first commercial run of the Vande Bharat sleeper train between Howrah and Kamakhya received an overwhelming response, with all tickets selling out within hours of bookings opening. Reservations for the train were fully booked within 24 hours after ticket sales began on January 19.The train began its maiden commercial journey from Kamakhya on January 22 and from Howrah on January 23. It will run six days a week and complete the Howrah–Kamakhya journey in about 14 hours, making it the fastest service on the route.Railway officials said the strong demand reflects a growing preference for modern trains offering shorter travel times, improved safety and enhanced comfort.The Vande Bharat sleeper has 16 coaches, including AC 3-tier, AC 2-tier and First AC, with a total passenger capacity of 823. It is equipped with advanced safety systems and upgraded passenger amenities.",West Bengal’s ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) accused the BJP-led Centre and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of policing people's plates.

Drawing on extensive national data, the report concludes that India is no longer constrained by lack of intent or ambition. Health schemes, hospitals, and digital platforms have expanded rapidly, but weak implementation, poor coordination, and governance gaps continue to undermine patient care.A nationwide citizens’ survey of nearly 50,000 households across 29 states found that people continue to travel long distances, repeat investigations, and spend heavily on medicines and diagnostics despite being enrolled in government schemes.“What stands out is that the report is citizen-centred,” said Mirai Chatterjee, Commissioner and Director, SEWA Social Security. District-level analysis of 687 districts also reveals stark variation in performance within the same state, showing that identical national policies produce very different outcomes depending on local capacity and the strength of primary care.The data highlights a persistent financing mismatch. Public health spending remains below 2% of GDP, while insurance schemes focus largely on hospitalisation, leaving outpatient care, medicines, and diagnostics—the biggest costs for families—poorly protected. Case studies and interviews with health workers and administrators point to fragmented governance, staff shortages, weak accountability, and broken referral systems as reasons why well-designed programmes falter on the ground.Summarising the findings, the Commission states that the main barriers to UHC are no longer political will or infrastructure gaps, but uneven quality of care, inefficient spending, fragmented delivery, and poor governance. Access has expanded, it notes, but assurance has not.At the heart of its roadmap is a call to rebuild the public health system as the backbone of universal coverage. Vikram Patel, Commission co-Chair and Professor at Harvard Medical School, said only a high-performing, publicly financed and publicly provided system—with nationwide reach from community health workers to tertiary hospitals—can deliver health equity at scale.Industry leaders echoed the focus on primary care and coordination. Dr Harsh Mahajan, Founder & Chairman, Mahajan Imaging & Labs, said strengthening preventive and primary care through Ayushman Arogya Mandirs is key, while Dr Dharminder Nagar, MD of Paras Health, noted that patients in states such as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh still face long travel, repeat tests, and high costs despite falling out-of-pocket spending nationally, underscoring the need for stronger public–private coordination, faster PM-JAY empanelment, and expanded outpatient coverage.Based on more than four years of research (2020–2024), the Commission says India can still turn UHC from a promise into a lived reality—if it fixes how care is delivered, not just how it is announced.","The Lancet Commission on a Citizen-Centred Health System for India says this gap between promise and lived experience is now the country’s central health challenge.

What is the Bhojshala-Kamal Maula Mosque dispute





NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday allowed Hindu prayers from sunrise to sunset on Basant Panchami at the disputed Bhojshala-Kamal Maula Mosque in Dhar, Madhya Pradesh, while permitting Muslims to offer namaz from 1 pm to 3 pm on the same day.The court also directed that a list of persons from the Muslim community coming for namaz be furnished to the district administration and instructed the administration to make law and order arrangements at the site for the offering of prayers.A bench comprising CJI Surya Kant and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi appealed to both sides to observe mutual respect and cooperate with the state and district administration for maintenance of law and order.Given the sensitivity of the situation, nearly 8,000 police personnel, including forces from the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and Rapid Action Force (RAF), have been deployed across Dhar district. CCTV surveillance, foot and vehicle patrols, and social media activity are being closely monitored, officials said. Saffron flags and 'Akhand Puja' billboards have also been put up in the city ahead of Basant Panchami.Hindus consider Bhojshala, an ASI-protected medieval-era monument, to be a temple dedicated to Goddess Vagdevi (Saraswati), while the Muslim community calls it the Kamal Maula mosque. The Bhoj Utsav Committee has requested permission to perform puja throughout January 23, with patron Ashok Jain stating that 30,000 to 50,000 devotees are expected to participate in the 'Akhand Puja' (continuous prayers). Meanwhile, Zulfikar Pathan, head of the Kamal Maula Namaz Intezamia Committee, said the Muslim community has requested Friday prayers between 1 pm and 3 pm, in accordance with the ASI’s April 7, 2003 order, “without any hindrance. ”The Supreme Court also directed that the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) report on the religious character of the Bhojshala-Saraswati Temple cum Kamal Maula Mosque be shared with both communities by the Madhya Pradesh High Court. The ASI report has been filed in a sealed cover before the High Court.Indore Rural Range Inspector General of Police, Anurag, has personally inspected the Bhojshala complex and reviewed the security arrangements ahead of the religious activities. Under the ASI’s 2003 arrangement, Hindus perform puja on Tuesdays, while Muslims offer namaz on Fridays.Historical research, both Indian and foreign, indicates that the Bhojshala complex, including the Vagdevi temple, existed centuries before the Kamal Maula Mosque, Radheshyam Yadav, former convenor of Hindu Jagaran Manch’s Indore division, has said. He claims the mosque was built after dismantling ancient Hindu temples.“Muslims refer to an ASI survey of Bhojshala in 1902-03 and ask why there should be a fresh study. Today, we have technology and scientific techniques that were not available then. This survey, along the lines of Gyanvapi and Ayodhya, will help reveal the truth about Bhojshala,” he said.Petitioners, Hindu Front for Justice, said the mosque was built during Alauddin Khilji’s reign over a preexisting temple, while Kamal Maula Mosque was constructed in 1514 under Mehmood Khilji II. ASI reports also note that parts of Bhojshala and the Vagdevi temple were dismantled to build the mosque. They point to inscriptions, carvings, and ritual structures as evidence of the temple’s prior existence.Dhar Shahar Qazi Sadiq countered, “For 700 years, salah/namaz has been offered at Kamal Maula Mosque. How can it be a temple? It was never a temple or school, and there was never any idol installed there. Dirty politics is leading to this tense situation.”The controversy began in 1893 when ASI’s German Indologist Alois Anton Fuhrer noted some sutras on the pillars but lacked evidence. The term “Bhojshala” was popularized in 1903 by Dhar Dewas’ education commissioner KK Lele, though the Imperial Gazetteer of 1908 later corrected this","Hindus consider Bhojshala, an ASI-protected medieval-era monument, to be a temple dedicated to Goddess Vagdevi (Saraswati), while the Muslim community calls it the Kamal Maula mosque.

NEW DELHI: Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut on Wednesday criticised Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis ’ visit to the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, calling it a “picnic” and questioning the relevance of the conference.“Chief ministers from various states in India are having a picnic in Davos,” Raut said. “The Davos conference is ridiculous from an Indian perspective.”Raut also raised questions over the chief minister signing agreements with Indian companies during the visit, stating that such deals could have been finalised in Mumbai.Raut told reporters, “The chief ministers from across the country are having a picnic in Davos. He (CM Fadnavis) will pay attention to the mayoral elections after that is over. The Davos conference is ridiculous from an Indian perspective. Chief ministers from many states meet there, they talk to each other, and Indian industries go to Davos and sign agreements, on taxpayers' money.”“They go to Davos every year. They should tell the nation and their states how much is spent on their travel. This could have happened sitting in Mumbai.If the figures (of the investment and job creation) being given are true, then I welcome them,” he added.Responding to Raut’s remarks, CM’s wife Amruta Fadnavis dismissed the criticism as baseless. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of an event in Mumbai, she said, “I can never understand his (Raut’s) language. But I will only say this much that someone who goes for a picnic does not hold conferences and meetings daily from 6 am to 11 pm to bring investment to India and Maharashtra, and boost employment.”“So I feel that this statement of his, like all his other statements, is baseless,” she said.Amruta also underlined the importance of the Davos conference, saying it is an international platform where representatives from across the world meet to discuss their countries and explore business opportunities. “Going there, I believe, is the duty of the head of every state in India,” she added.CM Fadnavis is in Davos to attend the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting, having departed on Sunday. Fadnavis has been credited with the BJP -led Mahayuti alliance’s performance in the recent municipal corporation elections. The BJP emerged as the single largest party in the 227-member Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, winning 89 seats.",Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut criticised Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis’ visit to the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos.

Monks and nuns may have renounced all trappings of worldly life — and many of them do not vote — but they, too, are being called for SIR (Special Intensive Revision) hearings, mainly for listing their spiritual gurus’ names under the ‘name of parent’ column in the electoral records.Taking cognisance of the inconvenience faced by monastic orders, the Election Commission (EC) has directed district election officers (DEOs) to conduct hearings at ashrams and religious institutions, instead of asking monks to travel to designated centres. In cases where supporting documents are unavailable, the DEO — who is the district magistrate — has been authorised to act as a quasi-judicial authority and clear voter applications.The issue surfaced after several monks received hearing notices due to address and identity mismatch, caused by years of transfers between ashrams. Eighty-two-year-old Swami Muktikamananda, adhyaksha of the century-old Gadadhar Ashram (Ramakrishna Math) in Bhowanipur, south Kolkata, said his voter ID card and Aadhaar were linked to a Ramakrishna Math in Bankura (more than 200km from Kolkata), where he had stayed for an extended period.“I was initially asked to attend a hearing in Bankura, but after intervention by electoral officials, I submitted my enumeration form in Bhowanipur itself,” he said.Last Wednesday, around 90 monks attended a special SIR camp organised at Belur Math, with hearings held at the Abhedananda Convention Centre. Participants included residents of the Belur headquarters as well as monks from centres such as the Ramakrishna Mission Ashrama in Narendrapur. While monks of the Ramakrishna Math and Mission do not vote, they seek inclusion in electoral rolls to avoid complications in visa applications and administrative work.Monks from Bharat Sevashram Sangha (BSS) and Iskcon, many of whom do vote, have also received SIR notices. Swami Mahadevananda of BSS said several monks had listed founder Acharya Swami Pranavananda’s name as their parent, triggering document mismatches. General secretary Dilip Maharaj said monks without passports attended a special hearing on Jan 20 at the Ballygunge headquarters.Iskcon spokesperson Radharamn Das said monks who had earlier voted in Kolkata had been asked to submit fresh documents from their native places across India and abroad.Voters in Jhargram and West Midnapore — in Bengal’s Jangalmahal, about 150km from Kolkata — have, over the years, learnt how to coexist with elephants. It’s a sort of mutual respect, born out of a certain wariness — and a tacit understanding: “Stay out of my hair, and I’ll stay out of yours.”During the SIR, regular elephant movement has coincided with a sudden rise in human movement — residents with voter detail anomalies are having to travel far and wide to arrive at hearing centres, a highly unsafe exercise. And, so, the poll body said yes when the two district administrations wanted to set up multiple hearing centres, located near human settlements, across six assembly constituencies.Similar arrangements are also being planned in elephant-heavy pockets of North Bengal.In West Midnapore, voters from select Jangalmahal villages will attend hearings at the Pirakata Community Hall, under the jurisdiction of Salboni police station. Salboni BDO Ruman Mondal said residents of villages such as Kalsibhanga, Satpati, Kalaimuri, Garmal, Lalgaria and Bhimpur were directed to appear at the new centre from Jan 15.Medinipur Sadar subdivisional officer Madhumita Mukherjee said it was a deliberate decision to choose the additional centres based on how close they were to villages, so that hearings could be conducted based on real-time elephant movement.“Ten additional centres have been set up in the district, including a consolidated venue catering to villages from two assembly constituencies in elephant corridors,” said Bijin Krishna, the DM of West Midnapore. In Jhargram, special hearing centres have been established at 10 high schools across the Nayagram, Gopiballavpur, Jhargram and Binpur constituencies. The DM, Akanksha Bhaskar, said the measures were taken in the interest of public safety.In the North Bengal districts of Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Jalpaiguri, Cooch Behar, Alipurduar, North Dinajpur and South Dinajpur, employment records issued by tea gardens and cinchona plantations are valid proofs of identity and residence for workers and their families.Labourers in tea and cinchona estates — many of whom have lived in makeshift quarters for generations — have struggled to produce conventional documents, such as land records or formal proof of address.As a result, during SIR hearings, they have been unable to come up with those documents, leading to fears of disenfranchisement. Plantation employment records are routinely maintained by garden authorities, and now that they have been recognised by the commission as a bona fide voter eligibility document, it’s come as immense relief for workers.Netas across the political spectrum welcomed the move, but while BJP MP Jayanta Roy called it an “excellent step”, TMC’s Rajya Sabha MP, Prakash Chik Baraik, said the move ought to have been taken long ago, and that the delay had caused unnecessary panic.Members of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) have welcomed EC’s decision to conduct doorstep verification, amid concerns over document availability and identity mismatch.In Totopara, home to the Toto community (the state’s smallest PVTG) in North Bengal’s Alipurduar, residents said the move has eased anxieties over land and identity records. “Many families do not have land khatiyans, while migrant workers lack links to ancestral property. We were worried, but the EC has taken extra care,” said Bakul Toto, secretary of the Toto Kalyan Samiti.Similar issues have surfaced among the Birhor and Lodha Shabar communities. Around 300 Birhors live in south Bengal’s Purulia district — across Balarampur, Baghmundi and Jhalda-I blocks, with 181 adults listed in the 2024 Lok Sabha electoral rolls. In forest-dependent areas, many Birhor families now reside in permanent houses provided by the state, but discrepancies in records have triggered SIR hearings.Lodha Shabar members — spread across West Midnapore and Jhargram — are also receiving notices. The community comprises over 1 lakh people across nearly 17,000 families. District administrations had flagged concerns over whether members possessed sufficient documentation, following which the EC, on Dec 31 last year, instructed DEOs to conduct physical verification.In West Midnapore, Lodha Shabar residents have been attending hearings at block development offices. In the Keshiary block, multiple villagers were summoned despite having submitted details during the enumeration. “We produced voter ID, Aadhaar and family details at the hearing,” said Basanti Dandapat of Lengamara village.West Bengal Lodha Shabar Development Board chairman Balai Naik said teams were visiting villages to reassure residents. “There is no need to panic. In cases of spelling errors or linkage issues, officials will verify details on the ground,” he said.Similar “special public hearings” have been ordered for sex workers as well, as many of them lack identity proof.Officials said district election officers have been instructed to hear such cases separately and adopt a facilitative approach, recognising that many sex workers have been disconnected from their families for decades or do not know their parents’ names.For 55-year-old Baby Khatun, who has lived in Sonagachi, Kolkata’s largest red light district, since she arrived there at the age of 10, the hearing notice triggered panic. “I only remember that my family lived in Kidderpore. I don’t know my parents’ names,” she said. With no immediate relatives, she listed her landlord as her guardian.“How can I produce a family tree? I don’t even know their names. I’m afraid my name will be deleted,” she said.Rekha Das, another sex worker, has a voter and Aadhaar cards but faced difficulty enrolling her son, a first-time voter, because the form requires the name of a blood relative from the mother’s side. “I have documents, but no family records,” she said.EC officials said the concerns were genuine and assured no eligible voter would be struck off the rolls solely for lack of documents, stressing that SIR was aimed at inclusion, not exclusion.","Monks and nuns are being called for SIR (Special Intensive Revision) hearings.

MCX Gold on the weekly chart is showing strong bullish momentum after breaking out of a brief consolidation phase and is currently trading near its all-time high of 157,750. With upward strength clearly reasserted and little indication of a reversal, the rally is likely to continue toward higher levels. The recent surge further validates the strength of the move, and the broader outlook remains positive as long as prices hold above the weekly low.From a weekly standpoint, the 145,000 level stands out as a crucial support, representing the recent lows of the current week. Any pullback toward this area is likely to invite fresh buying, helping to limit downside risk in the near term. Sustaining prices above this level reinforces the bullish structure and keeps the momentum positive.Gold seems well positioned to move toward the 175,000 level in the coming sessions. This potential upside aligns with the broader bullish trend and highlights the strength of prevailing market momentum. Moreover, the formation of higher highs and higher lows during the week further supports the positive sentiment, paving the way for a continued upward move.Overall, Gold continues to hold a positive bias, with the broader technical structure clearly supporting trend continuation. As long as prices remain above the key 145,000 support, the bullish setup stays intact. With momentum indicators and overall market sentiment remaining favourable, the precious metal appears well positioned for further upside in the sessions ahead.MCX Silver has posted fresh all-time highs for the fourth straight week, extending the sequence of higher highs that has been in place for several months. With no clear signs of momentum easing, the overall bias remains positive, and any corrective moves are likely to draw buying interest. We recommend trading in alignment with the prevailing trend, which remains firmly bullish, and avoiding positions that go against this strong upward momentum.Silver’s rally at the start of the week has highlighted a renewed strength in the trend, boosting the likelihood of further upside. As long as prices remain above the weekly support levels, the bullish bias should stay intact. The immediate key support is seen near the 310,000 zone, which could present a favourable buying opportunity. Any pullback toward this area is expected to attract fresh buying interest, helping to stabilize prices and sustain upward momentum.On the upside, Silver looks well positioned to challenge the 360,000 resistance in the near to medium term. This anticipated move reflects a continuation of the current bullish phase, supported by strong momentum and favourable technical indicators. Overall, as long as prices stay firmly above the 310,000 support, Silver is expected to sustain its positive trend, with ample scope for further gains as bullish sentiment continues to build.","Gold and silver prices are showing strong bullish momentum, says Abhilash Koikkara, Head - Forex & Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group.

Gold and Silver prices continue to surge higher marking record highs, as intensifying geopolitical risks and shifting US monetary expectations fuelled strong safe-haven demand through the week. Escalating unrest in Iran, where over 500 people were reportedly killed, renewed US threats of military action and tariffs on countries trading with Iran, and the arrest of Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro injected both short- and long-term uncertainty into global markets, supporting central bank buying and investor inflows into precious metals. With this President Trump has also levied tariffs on major EU nations with a threat to increase the same after June 1st if the deal to buy Greenland does not go through.Gold prices marked a low of around ₹141,000 and reversed sharply from there, as mentioned previously till prices are sustaining above ₹138,000 momentum for prices will remain on higher side. On lower end, immediate support remains at ₹143,000 and ₹140,000.Bollinger bands which were flat have expanded with prices on the higher side showcasing a positive run through expectations. This surge is more convincing as prices are rising along with a surge in volumes showing the buyers strength. The target of ₹145,000 is achieved, however any closing above the same could take the prices higher towards ₹148,000 and ₹152,000 from a medium to long term perspective.Despite a relatively firm dollar, Gold and Silver continued to mark record highs as geopolitical tensions, weak economic data, policy uncertainty, and easing inflation sustained safe-haven appeal. Focus this week will be on US inflation, GDP and speech from President Trump which could keep the volatility along with updates on uncertainties mentioned above.","Gold and Silver prices continue to surge higher marking record highs.

Budget 2026 income tax expectations: What individual taxpayers are hoping for,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/taxation/budget-2026-income-tax-expectations-what-individual-taxpayers-are-hoping-for-top-4-points-to-know/articleshow/127025732.cms,"As India prepares to implement the new Income-tax Act from 1 April 2026, expectations of major tax changes may need to be calibrated.



By Parizad Sirwalla

In view of the above, some of the areas that

individual taxpayers

may still hope to be addressed are: -

A Higher

Standard Deduction

Perquisite valuation rules for Electric Vehicles

Relief on Housing Loan Interest Under the New Tax Regime

Timelines for Revised or Belated Returns

(Parizad Sirwalla is Partner and Head - Global Mobility Services, Tax, KPMG in India)

Budget 2026 income tax expectations: Finance Minister will present Union Budget 2026 in the backdrop of uncertain geopolitical dynamics, volatile capital markets, diverse regulatory reforms (e.g. new income tax act, labour codes etc.), fluctuating oil prices as well as INR-USD exchange rate and other uncertainties. However, the one thing certain is that the individual taxpayer will be brimming with expectations of a promise of more net disposable income in their hands on a warm Sunday afternoon of 1 February 2026.However, as India prepares to implement the new Income-tax Act from 1 April 2026, expectations of major tax changes may need to be calibrated. Potentially it may be possible that the Budget may focus on micro, practical changes and administrative improvements, such as faster refunds, simpler compliance etc. to improve taxpayer experience and ensure a smooth transition to the new law.One of the most frequently raised expectations is enhancement of the standard deduction, which currently stands at Rs 50,000 under the old tax regime and Rs 75,000 under the new tax regime.With inflation continuing to raise living costs, the salaried taxpayers are hopeful that the deduction limit will be increased to at least Rs 1 lakh. A higher deduction would provide relief to taxpayers at a time when rising living costs are placing increased pressure on the household finances.Also Read | Budget 2026 income tax: Will GST-style fewer tax slabs be brought under new income tax regime? Electric vehicles (EVs) are increasingly seen as the future of mobility, and in line with their broader ESG commitments, many employers are now encouraging employees to opt for an EV under their company car lease policies. However, the current perquisite valuation rules continue to rely solely on the cubic capacity of the car, an approach that does not account for the distinct nature of EVs, which do not have an engine in the conventional sense.Hence, it may be practical for the government to introduce a separate valuation mechanism specifically for EVs to ensure a suitable tax treatment and to further promote their adoption.Home loan borrowers have long relied on interest related tax deductions to reduce their repayment burden. However, under the new tax regime, individuals cannot offset housing loan interest against salary income, even in the case of a self‑occupied property.With housing prices continuing to rise and the government’s broader aim of promoting home ownership at affordable rates, there is an expectation that the government may in the upcoming budget allow such interest deduction at least on self-occupied property under the new tax regime. This would provide relief to mid‑income taxpayers families and help build further confidence of taxpayers in the new tax regime.Also Read | Budget 2026: Why standard deduction should be hiked under the new income tax regime - explained Under current provisions, taxpayers can file a revised or belated return for a financial year only up to 31 December following the end of that year. However, this timeline often poses challenges, particularly for individual taxpayers with cross-border income or investments, as tax filings in their home or host countries may not be finalized by then. This mismatch can result in unintentional under-reporting or over-reporting of income in India. For instance, a US citizen who becomes an ordinarily resident in India may be required to report global income for parts of two calendar years in a single Indian tax return, even though overseas tax filings are completed later. Given these practical difficulties, extending the deadline for filing revised or belated returns would provide much-needed relief and help ensure accurate reporting.As the government prepares for the landmark shift to the new Income-tax Act in April 2026, the Union Budget presents an opportunity to address a few long‑standing demands of individual taxpayers. While sweeping changes may be unlikely in a year of transition, targeted reforms whether through higher deductions or more flexible timelines could significantly improve the taxpayer experience. Ultimately, the hope is that the Budget will strike the right balance between fiscal prudence and the genuine needs of India’s growing salaried class.","As India prepares to implement the new Income-tax Act from 1 April 2026, expectations of major tax changes may need to be calibrated. One of the most frequently raised expectations is enhancement of the standard deduction, which currently stands at Rs 50,000 under the old tax regime.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127026109,imgsize-486742,width-400,resizemode-4/budget-2026-income-tax.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Light rain and a thunderstorm on Friday provided slight relief from pollution in the national capital, but air quality remained in the “poor” category, with the AQI recorded at 297 at 7 am, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). Light rain also lashed Ghaziabad and Noida.This marked a marginal improvement from Thursday morning, when the AQI had been in the “very poor” category at 312.Several parts of the national capital continued to register poor air quality, with Anand Vihar at 317, Ashok Vihar 335, Wazirpur 351, Punjabi Bagh 326, RK Puram 315, Bawana 342, ITO 266, Chandni Chowk 326, and Dwarka Sector 8 316, the CPCB reported.Meanwhile, the temperature in Delhi was around 16.4°C at 7 am, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).Under the AQI classification, readings are categorised as follows: 0–50 ‘Good’, 51–100 ‘Satisfactory’, 101–200 ‘Moderate’, 201–300 ‘Poor’, 301–400 ‘Very Poor’, and 401–500 ‘Severe’.Thursday had been unusually warm, with the mercury soaring to 27.1°C, about seven degrees above normal, marking the warmest January day in seven years.The high temperature was attributed to persistent warm easterly winds and clear skies, which increased sunshine hours.“Westerly winds are cold, while easterly winds are warm during this time of the year,” a weather official explained.With multiple spells of rain expected on Friday, the temperature is likely to drop. Officials said the maximum temperature is forecast to fall to 18-20°C on Friday and further to 16-18°C on Saturday.The rainy spells, accompanied by cloud cover, are also expected to bring down Delhi’s air quality index (AQI) to the poor category on Friday and to moderate by Saturday, if the predictions hold true.The IMD has issued a yellow alert for rain across the city. “Another round of very light to light rain is likely towards the afternoon or evening on Friday,” officials added, advising residents to remain cautious of strong winds and localized thunderstorms.A day earlier, the Sub-Committee on the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) of the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) revoked all Stage III measures across Delhi-NCR with immediate effect on January 22, following improvements in air quality and favorable forecast trends.A statement from the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change said: “The Sub-Committee had invoked Stage III of GRAP on January 16, 2026, after a deterioration in Delhi’s average AQI.” Since then, air quality has shown a downward trend. According to the daily AQI Bulletin from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the average AQI improved from 378 on January 20 to 330 on January 21 and 322 on January 22.Considering this improving trend, and based on air quality and meteorological forecasts from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), the CAQM Sub-Committee convened today to review the situation.","Light rain and a thunderstorm on Friday provided slight relief from pollution in the national capital.

Bringing Gold Lending Into the Formal Economy

India stands at a pivotal juncture where inclusive growth must extend beyond metros to Tier-2, Tier-3, and rural economies. One powerful yet underutilised lever in this journey is household gold. In recent years, the value of household gold has more than doubled, significantly increasing family wealth across India. According to a 2025 Morgan Stanley estimate, Indian households hold nearly 34,600 tonnes of gold jewellery, valued at around $3.8 trillion—almost 89 percent of the country’s GDP. Much of this gold has been accumulated over generations or acquired to mark important life milestones.While gold carries immense emotional and cultural significance, in its idle form it contributes little to economic activity. It is therefore imperative that India deploys effective policies to enable household gold to be used productively—without forcing families to relinquish ownership.Gold loans offer precisely this solution. They allow households to unlock the economic value of gold while retaining emotional ownership, making gold a working asset that supports livelihoods, enterprise, and growth.Over the past few years, regulators have taken meaningful steps to introduce balanced regulations that protect customers while supporting sectoral development.These measures, coming into effect from April 1, 2026, create a stronger foundation. However, to unlock the full potential of gold loans for inclusive growth, further reforms are needed.Credit penetration in rural India remains low, particularly among shopkeepers and MSMEs—estimated at nearly six million nationwide. Many continue to lack access to formal finance, even as they need working capital to upgrade infrastructure, manage inventory, and expand offerings.Gold loans are ideally suited to meet these short-term needs. Interest is charged only for the period the loan is utilised, allowing borrowers to repay when cash flows improve and re-borrow as required. This flexible credit cycle supports business growth, encourages financial discipline, and mobilises household savings in a way that benefits both borrowers and the broader economy.Strengthening Last-Mile Credit Through NBFC Branch ExpansionA key reason for low credit penetration in Tier-2, Tier-3, and rural areas is limited physical branch presence. Over time, NBFCs have demonstrated a superior ability to reach underserved regions, tailor products to local needs, and operate efficiently through well-established models.For gold loans in particular, physical branches are essential and cannot be fully replaced by digital channels, unlike unsecured personal loans. Encouraging NBFCs to expand branch networks would significantly improve access and deepen market penetration.Currently, regulatory restrictions and prescriptive guidelines on branch expansion can slow network growth. Liberalising these norms—especially for collateral-backed products like gold loans—would accelerate outreach while maintaining prudential safeguards.NBFCs play a critical role in last-mile credit delivery, particularly for small-ticket and entry-level loans in rural areas. However, all NBFC loans currently carry a uniform 100 percent risk weight, which raises the cost of lending and limits credit supply.Gold loans are regulated by loan-to-value (LTV) norms, similar to home loans, where risk weights vary based on LTV. Extending a similar risk-based framework to gold loans could unlock significant capital, enabling NBFCs to expand credit availability to deserving borrowers.A coordinated approach between the Government and regulators can help create a supportive policy framework that recognises the broader economic and nation-building potential of expanding gold loan credit.Recent stress in unsecured lending segments, including microfinance, has adversely affected credit scores for millions of households. Many of these borrowers experienced temporary or one-time defaults and are now excluded from formal credit.Targeted schemes are needed to help such borrowers re-enter the formal financial system. Ensuring that temporary distress does not lead to permanent exclusion will allow households to regain access to credit and participate productively in the economy.Housing is a powerful economic driver in rural India, with strong linkages to nearly 50 sectors. While banks offer rural housing loans, their reach in smaller ticket sizes—below ₹10–15 lakh—is limited. NBFCs, with their extensive branch networks, are better positioned to serve this segment.However, SARFAESI Act provisions restrict NBFCs’ ability to recover smaller-ticket secured loans, as enforcement is allowed only for outstanding amounts of ₹20 lakh and above. Harmonising SARFAESI applicability for NBFCs in line with banks and housing finance companies would significantly improve credit flow and accelerate rural housing growth.An estimated 60 percent of gold lending remains unregulated. Formal gold loans, by contrast, operate under clear regulatory guidelines and supervision. Allowing greater flexibility in NBFC branch expansion would accelerate formalisation and extend regulated credit to underserved markets.With a strong regulatory framework already in place, wider branch access can help bring millions of borrowers into the formal financial system.The upcoming Budget presents a timely opportunity to build on existing reforms. With continued policy support and regulatory alignment, gold loans can unlock household wealth, deepen rural credit access, and drive inclusive growth across Tier-2, Tier-3, and rural India.","India stands at a pivotal juncture where inclusive growth must extend beyond metros to Tier-2, Tier-3, and rural economies.

Visa stamping delay+ prudential revocation of visas





The H-1B stamping delay that began in December continues till now, as no new interview slots opened and now interview dates are being deferred to 2027. Immigration experts said there is no hope for the situation to get better, and the only thing that H-1B visa holders in the US can do is to not travel to India for visa stamping as dates are only getting delayed. Hundreds of H-1B visa holders got stuck in India last December after they traveled to India to get their visa stamping as scheduled in December, only to be told that their interview dates had been deferred to 2026 as the visa officers started social media vetting.Those who had their interview dates in January, February also received emails for their respective consulates that their dates have been moved to April-May 2027.Immigration attorney Emily Neumann said she did not hear about any new visa interview slots opening for India in the last 50 days. Neumann said H-1Bs who are in the US should not even try to get an appointment for visa stamping in India. ""They are not in any hurry to give you a visa. They are trying to deny visas whenever they can. It is a completely different world from what we saw during the Biden administration. This administration does not want to give you visa,"" Neumann said.Amid the delay in stamping, US State Department is also revoking visas prudentially, and H-4 visa holders are also getting their visas revoked because of their H-1B spouses. Prudential visa revocation is a cancelation of the visa by the administration based on new information that suggests that the visa holder might be ineligible for the visa. Immigration experts said they are noticing an emerging pattern where the H-4 spouse of an H-1B visa holder is visiting the consulate for stamping only to be told that their visa has been revoked because of some old DUI of the H-1B spouse.",The H-1B stamping delay that began in December continues till now.

India-EU trade: GSP suspension raises tariffs on 87% of exports; here's what GTRI report says,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-eu-trade-gsp-suspension-raises-tariffs-on-87-of-exports-heres-what-gtri-report-say/articleshow/127159888.cms,"‘Free Trade Over Isolationism’: Germany Chancellor Signals Strategic Push For India-EU Deal in Davos

What changes with GSP withdrawal

Impact across core industrial sectors

FTA optimism tempered by timing

CBAM adds another layer of cost

Why the EU withdrew GSP benefits

India’s exports to the European Union is facing higher import tariffs from January 1, 2026, after the EU suspended Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP) benefits for 87% of Indian goods, according to a report by trade policy think tank, Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI).The move means that a large share of Indian exports will now be charged full Most Favoured Nation (MFN) tariffs, ending years of preferential access under the EU’s unilateral trade arrangement for developing countries.Under the GSP framework, Indian exporters benefited from a margin of preference (MoP) — a reduction on MFN tariffs — which averaged around 20% for most textiles, garments and industrial products. With the suspension now in effect, that preference has ended.For example, an apparel item that attracted a 12% MFN tariff but paid only 9.6% under GSP will now be subject to the full 12% duty, directly impacting exporter margins.GTRI said this change is particularly significant for price-sensitive sectors such as garments, where even small tariff increases can influence sourcing decisions and push EU buyers towards duty-free suppliers such as Bangladesh and Vietnam.The suspension applies to nearly all major industrial categories that form the backbone of India’s exports to Europe. These include minerals, chemicals, plastics and rubber, textiles and garments, stone and ceramics, precious metals, iron and steel, base metals, machinery, electrical goods and transport equipment.GSP preferences will now remain available only for a limited set of products — agriculture and food, leather goods, wood and paper, footwear, optical and medical instruments, and handicrafts — together accounting for less than 13% of India’s exports to the EU.While negotiations on the India–EU Free Trade Agreement are close to conclusion, the agreement is expected to take at least a year to come into force. Until then, exporters will have to operate under full MFN tariffs, raising costs and squeezing margins.The timing adds to near-term challenges, as exporters adjust to higher duties amid already fragile global trade conditions.The impact of GSP withdrawal coincides with the start of the tax phase of the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) from January 1, 2026.Indian steel and aluminium exporters are facing rising carbon reporting and compliance requirements, along with the risk of being charged default emissions values, increasing non-tariff costs. GTRI described the combined effect of higher tariffs and CBAM compliance as a double pressure on exporters.The EU’s GSP system allows developing countries to export at reduced tariffs but includes “graduation” rules, under which preferences are withdrawn once exports in a product group cross a threshold for three consecutive years.India has been graduated for the 2026–2028 period under Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2025/1909, adopted in September 2025. While the decision follows established EU rules, the report notes that the economic impact is immediate, with most Indian exports losing preferential access at once.With higher tariffs, rising compliance costs and delayed FTA relief, 2026 is shaping up as a particularly testing year for Indian exports to Europe, GTRI said.Ajay Srivastava noted that until the India–EU FTA is implemented, exporters will need to navigate a period of reduced competitiveness, especially in sectors exposed to both tariff and climate-related trade measures.","India’s exports to the European Union is facing higher import tariffs from January 1, 2026.

Budget 2026- How To Respond to the Global Trade War

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget 2026 at a time when the global economy is facing headwinds from the trade war unleashed by US President Donald Trump. India has been levied with one of the steepest tariffs - 50% for its exports to the US. The implication of this decision is important since America is India’s largest trading partner.An India-US trade deal is still stuck in negotiations - the US wants India to stop buying crude oil from Russia, and it wants India to open up its agriculture and dairy sectors to American products. On both demands, India has maintained a firm stance - decisions on which country to procure crude from is about economics and strategic autonomy, and agriculture and dairy sectors have never been opened for access as part of trade deals.In this backdrop, Budget 2026 assumes significance - how will the Modi government insulate the Indian economy from the impact of Trump’s trade tariffs?India is among the world’s top 5 economies in nominal GDP terms and is on the road to become the third largest after the US and China in the coming years. It is also the world’s fastest growing major economy. With the world’s largest population, the importance of India as a market to sell in cannot be ignored.Importantly, India is largely a domestic demand driven growth story - a fact that somewhat insulates it from external headwinds. Dr DK Srivastava, Chief Policy Advisor at EY says, “It (Indian economy) is in some sense insulated from the ongoing global uncertainties. India's strategy is to diversify its export destinations and become more competitive, so that for the domestic producers, there is cost competitiveness and scale offered through domestic demand over and above which they can export,” he tells TOI.But as it looks to step up its exports, the 50% tariffs from the US are a major impediment.India’s merchandise exports to the US fell 1.83% year-on-year to $6.88 billion in December 2025, while imports rose 7.57% to $4.03 billion, even as exports grew 9.75% during April–December.Despite a 50% US tariff on Indian goods from August 27, Commerce Secretary Rajesh Agrawal has said exports remain on a positive growth path as both sides negotiate a bilateral trade agreement.As Rishi Shah, Partner and Economic Advisory Services Leader, Grant Thornton Bharat notes: Over the past few years, the Union Budget has played a constructive role in engineering an ecosystem for growth, with a decisive tilt toward productive public expenditure, balance-sheet repair and macro stability. This has allowed India to absorb repeated global shocks with relatively limited disruption.Economists surveyed by Times of India Online are of the view that India’s economic growth story is largely domestic driven, which largely insulates it from external headwinds and shocks. However, the exports facing sectors, which are bearing the brunt of the global trade war need relief. Steps to enhance export competitiveness and diversification of basket, customs duty rationalisation, along with relief for MSMEs are needed, feel experts.Most economists also stress the need for continued capital expenditure push while working to reduce fiscal deficit, and focus on job creation.Ranen Banerjee, Partner, Government Sector Leader at PwC India tells TOI, “There are sectors that have a higher exposure to externalities and some of them are labour intensive and many in the MSME segment. Given there cannot be a direct intervention to support them, the budget can look at bringing down their cost of doing business, cost of working capital and also help lay the foundations for competitiveness.”“This could be through higher allocations for the credit guarantee scheme, reducing compliance burdens and creation of common shared infrastructure/facilities that help them improve quality control, meeting export standards in the finished products. The short term pressures on employment in the job intensive sectors affected by global uncertainties could be supported by redirecting the labour to construction through continued higher allocations to capex and concessions to housing and property to spur housing demand,” he says.“Budget 2026 should aim to further boost consumption by following policies that would create jobs and lower the cost of living,” an economist at an industry body told TOI.The economist advocates boosting public investment, crowding in domestic and foreign private capital through investor facilitation, prioritizing affordable housing via a National Urban Planning Authority, and strengthening future-ready education and skilling to expand employment opportunities.Rishi Shah of Grant Thornton Bharat says that Budget 2026 should now return to first principles and reinforce the economy’s internal resilience.First, policy must focus on strengthening businesses by durably lowering the cost of doing business—not through protection, but via regulatory certainty, simpler compliance, faster dispute resolution and continued logistics efficiency gains. In a fragmented global trade environment, competitiveness will matter more than preferential market access, and these measures directly support both domestic activity and export viability.Second, public sector capital expenditure must remain elevated and well-targeted. Beyond its near-term demand impact, public capex expands productive capacity, alleviates infrastructure bottlenecks and improves private investment viability—especially when global financial conditions remain uneven.Third, the budget should sharpen its emphasis on innovation, quality standards and domestic value addition, particularly within manufacturing and MSMEs. Sustained growth will increasingly depend on India’s ability to move up the value chain rather than merely scale volumes.Finally, fiscal credibility remains a macro anchor. Improving expenditure efficiency while maintaining a transparent and credible deficit path is essential to preserve investor confidence and monetary-fiscal coordination. In combination, these priorities can help India de-risk growth from external volatility while laying the groundwork for durable economic transformation.The above four themes are also the broad recommendations of most economists that TOI Online spoke to.Madan Sabnavis, Chief Economist at Bank of Baroda notes that uncertainty relating to trade wars is likely to remain until a trade deal is signed and the content examined.“The Budget can buffer certain vulnerable sectors through measures to support the MSME segment. This group largely houses industries like garments, leather products, jewelry, handcrafts, auto parts etc, which are the ones which are susceptible to an impact due to the ongoing tariff regime pursued in the USA,” he advises.Radhika Rao, Executive Director and Senior Economist at DBS Bank is of the view that the centre might prioritise strategic sectors, which include defence, semiconductors, electronics, renewable energy, artificial intelligence/robotics etc.“Budget allocations towards the defence sector have targeted modernisation and expansion of the indigenous manufacturing capacity, with indications of a double-digit increase in the FY27 Budget. An uncertain geopolitical environment also increases the urgency to boost domestic procurement and strengthen the security apparatus. Development of new core technologies will also require a skilled workforce, which can benefit from industry and cross-country collaborations,” she tells TOI.Yuvika Singhal, Economist at QuantEco says that diversification in terms of products and geographics is the biggest insulation. “Friend shoring has emerged as a relevant underlying guiding principle for crafting trade deals that are mutually beneficial. In the past one-year India has successfully concluded trade deals with UK, EFTA, Oman & New Zealand. The icing on the cake would be the signing of the much awaited US-India trade deal. To expedite the conclusion of the same, it would perhaps become imperative for India to revamp its customs duty framework, including the non-trade barriers,” she tells TOI.“In this context, we expect the FY27 Union Budget to notify critical changes to the existing customs rate framework. This would be consistent with the long-standing demand for correcting the inverted duty structure in several manufacturing sectors and promotion of ease of doing business,” she adds.Rumki Majumdar, Economist at Deloitte India recommends that the policies need to be reoriented towards supply-side resilience. This can be done by easing compliance and expanding capacity. She tells TOI that the export market for India should be widened and deepened through effective FTA implementation.She says that public capex should be sustained with a focus on debt-to-GDP discipline to bolster competitiveness and insulate domestic demand.Sachchidanand Shukla - Group Chief Economist at Larsen & Toubro tells TOI, “Budget will do well to reiterate India’s thrust to insulate growth by continuing to lean on buttressing growth via improved quality of expenditure (maintaining focus on Infrastructure, adequate support to needy segments esp the ones hit by Tariffs), transparency (weeded out off-budget borrowings) and communicating the shift to debt/GDP with more clarity and better communication since debt will be the fiscal anchor as against fiscal deficit, which was relatively better understood as the annual operating target. ”“The idea of keeping debt on a declining path may not be as easy to understand or communicate and that may have implications for interest rates and the pricing of government securities,” he adds.Fiscal discipline with emphasis on capital expenditure is a common ask by economists. Sujan Hajra, Chief Economist and Executive Director at Anand Rathi Group, said Budget 2026 should sustain high government capital expenditure to ease infrastructure bottlenecks. Economic growth needs to be supported as global demand softens amid trade tensions.He adds that maintaining a credible fiscal consolidation path is essential to anchor investor confidence.DK Srivastava of EY India also talks of fiscal focus. “There would be some further rationalization on customs duty and there may be some reciprocal commodity by commodity decision that the government takes, but the budget will actually ensure that these growth drivers that have helped the Indian economy in FY 26 will continue to operate. The budget will emphasize continued fiscal consolidation and government capex demand to remain stable and supportive so the overall fiscal policy supports growth,” he says.",Budget 2026 assumes significance - how will the Modi government insulate the Indian economy from the impact of Trump’s trade tariffs?

What is Blue Davos and why water dominates the Davos 2026 agenda

Extreme water events are becoming more common

Long term data show rising pressure on freshwater

Flood exposure is growing alongside scarcity

Oceans are warming faster than expected

Economic stakes are drawing new attention

New approaches are beginning to surface





A theme known as ""Blue Davos"" is beginning to emerge at the World Economic Forum 's annual meeting, signifying that water-related issues are no longer marginalised in international discourse. The connections between rivers, oceans, glaciers, and groundwater as a one stressed system are receiving more attention. The food supply, commercial routes, public health, and economic stability are all under pressure, frequently simultaneously. In 2026, the UAE will host just the third UN Water Conference in nearly 50 years, raising hopes that long-standing issues may finally find political attention and financial support. The tone is more about acknowledging boundaries that are become increasingly difficult to ignore than it is about declaring crises.At Davos, water is no longer framed as a narrow development issue or a footnote to climate policy. Under the Blue Davos label, it is being treated as a core condition for economic resilience and political stability. Briefings point to disruptions across the water cycle that are appearing more often and lasting longer. Flooding, drought and pollution are touching supply chains, energy systems and cities in uneven ways.Bringing oceans and freshwater into the same discussion reflects a broader scientific view that changes in one part of the system tend to echo elsewhere, sometimes far from where they begin.Recent events have made the pattern harder to ignore. In late 2024, rivers in parts of the Amazon basin dropped to unusually low levels, while Spain dealt with its most serious flooding in decades. Similar contrasts appeared in other regions, occasionally within the same country. Water arrives suddenly and destructively in some places, while it retreats for months in others. Researchers often describe this less as a series of isolated shocks and more as a hydrological cycle that is drifting out of balance, shaped by accumulated stress rather than a single breaking point.Longer records reinforce that impression. Since 1900, the share of global land affected by dry conditions has more than doubled, according to OECD data. This expansion strains drinking water supplies and agriculture at the same time. Large lakes offer another signal. Around half of the world’s biggest lakes no longer recover easily after periods of stress. River basins show similar instability, swinging between unusually high and low flows instead of staying within familiar seasonal ranges.Flood risk has increased alongside water shortage. World Bank estimates suggest roughly 1.8 billion people face exposure to significant flooding during a one-in-100-year event, most of them in low and middle-income countries. Even shallow flooding can interrupt housing, transportation, and daily work. These impacts are often felt most severely in areas where sanitation and access to safe drinking water are already unreliable. What emerges is not a single global picture but a patchwork shaped by income, geography and infrastructure.The ocean side of the cycle is shifting as well. Ocean warming has accelerated sharply since the 1980s, bringing effects that include ice loss, rising seas and acidification. Glaciers are losing hundreds of gigatonnes of ice each year. These changes influence weather patterns and coastal economies, sometimes far inland. The scale of these links helps explain why Blue Davos treats marine and freshwater issues as parts of the same problem rather than separate tracks.Water also carries economic weight that is becoming harder to overlook. Estimates place the annual value of water ecosystems at around 58 trillion dollars. Investment, however, has not kept pace. Only a small share of global water funding comes from private sources, leaving gaps in infrastructure and resilience. Projections suggest that close to a third of global GDP could be exposed to high water stress by mid century. These figures are nudging the conversation toward risk and long term stability rather than short term fixes.Some responses are beginning to appear. Water-focused microfinance schemes have helped millions gain access to safe taps and sanitation. Industry groups are testing cooperation at the river basin level, while ocean-related innovation is attracting more investors than in the past. Funding linked to the blue economy has grown quickly over the last decade, driven partly by recognition that degradation carries financial risk. These efforts do not resolve the wider imbalance. They sit alongside uncertainty and long timelines, as attention slowly builds toward 2026.","Water is no longer framed as a narrow development issue or a footnote to climate policy. Under the Blue Davos label, it is being treated as a core condition for economic resilience and political stability. Flooding, drought and pollution are touching supply chains, energy systems and cities in uneven ways.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126788163,imgsize-357688,width-400,resizemode-4/blue-davos-2026-what-it-means-and-why-2026-is-being-called-the-year-of-water.jpg"

"ED arrests Gurgaon's Richa Industries promoter for cheating banks, laundering assets during firm’s insolvency",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/ed-arrests-richa-industries-promoter-for-cheating-banks-laundering-assets-during-firms-insolvency/articleshow/127186111.cms,"





NEW DELHI: ED on Thursday arrested Sandeep Gupta , promoter of Richa Industries Ltd, from Gurgaon after it was found that he had not only cheated banks of hundreds of crores of rupees but had also allegedly laundered the company's valuable assets, when it went to insolvency, by diverting them to shell entities floated by him and his associates. Gupta was remanded to eight days of ED custody by a special court in Gurgaon.The probe is one of the many the agency has launched into fraud cases related to corporate insolvency where assets were allegedly siphoned off before the companies were sold, with lender banks forced to take haircuts of up to 90-95% of their outstandings.In a similar case, ED recently shared information with the Delhi Police for registering an FIR against Suraksha, which had acquired Jaypee Infratech Ltd (JIL) through insolvency, but has now been accused of siphoning off prime commercial properties and hospitals of JIL, laundering proceeds through shell entities beneficially owned by the promoters and their family members.In the Richa Industries Ltd (RIL) case, the corporate insolvency resolution process initiated in 2018 reached a dead end in absence of an approved resolution plan, leading the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to order liquidation on June 11 last year. A liquidator was appointed and the sale of RIL yielded Rs 40 crore to public sector Indian Overseas Bank (IOB) and Union Bank against admitted claims of Rs 696 crore, an approximate 94% haircut, ED said.The agency has accused Gupta of a ""concerted conspiracy"" to siphon off the company's assests and subvert the corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP).""Investigation found that in Oct 2018, just before initiation of CIRP, RIL issued corporate guarantees of over Rs 232 crore to six entities, all signed by Gupta. These beneficiary entities collectively held 48.25% voting rights in the Committee of Creditors (CoC), effectively blocking IOB and Union Bank from independently steering or approving any resolution. The timing and concentration of guarantees indicate deliberate structuring to influence CoC control during insolvency proceedings,"" ED has said.To subvert the insolvency process, it said, Gupta had incorporated a shell company, Saariga Constructions Pvt Ltd (SCPL), using former RIL employee Neha Singh as a ‘benamidar'. ""Through coordinated efforts, SCPL is said to have fraudulently secured voting rights in the CoC, enabling the Gupta family to obstruct and influence CIRP in their favour,"" ED said.The agency noted that significant diversion of funds through related party transactions. Between 2015-16 and 2017-18, about Rs 16.4 crore were siphoned off to group entities under the guise of loan repayments. During 2018-19, RIL funds were used to acquire controlling interest in Richa Krishna Constructions Pvt Ltd, diverting a valuable Rohtak project during CIRP. In the same period, shares of RIL were transferred at a gross undervaluation, causing financial loss to RIL, ED claimed.",Sandeep Gupta was remanded to eight days of ED custody by a special court in Gurgaon.

They have been sent to 5-day judicial custody.A Delhi court has acquitted former CM Arvind Kejriwal for skipping multiple ED summonses asking him to join its probe in the excise policy case, saying summons issued by email were neither valid nor legal. The agency failed to prove Kejriwal intentionally disobeyed the summonses, the court ruled, adding that as a sitting CM, Kejriwal too enjoyed a right of movement.Wiztown director Abhay Kumar was the first to be arrested after police registered an FIR on Sunday under sections 105 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 106-1 (causing death by negligence) and 125 (rashness or negligence endangering life) of the BNS.Kumar is in six-day judicial custody.The same charges have been invoked against Bansal and Karnwal.Police sources said Thursday's arrests followed intelligence gathering about their movements and electronic surveillance. Bansal is based in Faridabad while Karnwal lives in Shalimar Garden Extension 2, in Ghaziabad.""The area was left unsecured, without proper barricading or warning signage, resulting in the vehicle entering the waterlogged plot,"" a police source said.The investigation, sources said, had revealed serious lapses at the construction site that proved fatal for Mehta.Based on the evidence that was collected during the probe, Bansal and Karnwal were found to be directly involved in the management and supervision of the site, making them accountable for negligence, the sources said.On Wednesday, Kumar was named in a second FIR that was filed under sections of the environment protection and water pollution acts.Police have sealed Kumar's office located in Sector 62 and the corporate office of the company in Sector 126.
