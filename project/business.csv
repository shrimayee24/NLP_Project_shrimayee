Move against VP ploy by 'rattled' Cong to divert focus from Soros links: Rijiju

NEW DELHI: In a first in parliamentary history, the INDIA bloc of opposition parties Tuesday submitted a notice for the removal of vice-president Jagdeep Dhankhar , who also serves as chairman of Rajya Sabha, accusing him of ""partisan"" conduct as the RS chair.While the motion is unlikely to be passed, opposition members, however, downplayed the inevitability of defeat and insisted that the move was meant to be a ""strong message to fight for parliamentary democracy "". Congress MPs Jairam Ramesh and Naseer Hussain submitted the notice signed by 60 MPs, including those from TMC, SP, RJD, CPI, CPM, JMM, AAP and DMK, to RS secretary general P C Mody.Condemning the move, parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju said, ""The opposition disrespects the dignity of the chair, be it in Rajya Sabha or Lok Sabha... In parliamentary tradition, speakers of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha are our guides. We must obey whoever sits on the chair."" He stressed that NDA had a majority in the House.Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju on Tuesday dubbed INDIA bloc's move to submit a notice for the removal of Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar as ""extremely regrettable"" and said the move was intended to divert focus from what he described as Congress-Soros ""anti-India agenda"".Talking to reporters, he defended the Vice President, who is also chairman of Rajya Sabha, and described him as ""extremely professional and impartial"".""The opposition disrespects the dignity of the chair, be it in Rajya Sabha or Lok Sabha. We all know that in the parliamentary tradition, the speakers of both Houses are our guides. Whoever sits on the chair, we have to obey them. Congress and their alliance have continuously behaved wrongly by not following the direction of the chair,"" he said.Praising Dhankhar, Rijiju highlighted his humble background and commitment to farmers' and public welfare both inside and outside Parliament. ""He guides us. We respect him,"" he added.""I condemn the action of those 60 MPs who have signed the notice. NDA has the majority, and we all have faith in the chairman. We are happy with how he guides the House,"" the minister said.Attacking Congress, Rijiju said amid reports of ""links"" between George Soros and Congress leadership, along with their ""combined anti-India agenda"", Congress and its allies were ""rattled.""""I think Congress leadership should apologise to the country. The entire nation is worried about this issue,"" the minister said.","Move against VP ploy by 'rattled' Cong to divert focus from Soros links: Rijiju. 60 MPs, including those from TMC, SP, RJD, CPI, CPM, JMM, AAP and DMK, to RS secretary general P C Mody.

NEW DELHI: Bengaluru techie Atul Subhash’s brother Bikas Kumar accused Subhash’s wife, her mother, brother, and uncle of filing false complaints and demanding Rs 3 crore for a settlement. Kumar claimed that the relentless harassment drove Subhash to end his life.A 34-year-old deputy general manager of a private firm, Atul Subhash, died by suicide in his flat at Manjunatha Layout’s Delfinium Residency on Monday.Subhash, originally from Uttar Pradesh, left behind a 24-page suicide note accusing his wife, her family members, and even a judge, of pushing him to the brink. He alleged explicit instigation for suicide, harassment, extortion, and corruption.The victim's father, too alleged that Subhash's wife framed Subhash in multiple cases. He said, ""He (victim) had said to us that those in the mediation court do not work as per law, not even as per the rules of Supreme Court. He had to go to Jaunpur from Bengaluru at least 40 times. She (the deceased's wife) used to frame one charge after another. He must have been frustrated but never let us feel that. Suddenly, we received the information about the incident - he sent a mail to our younger son around 1 am. It's 100% true (the allegations of the deceased against his wife and her family). We cannot express the level of tension that our son would have been in.""The Hoysala Police Control Room received a call early Monday morning about the incident. Upon reaching the flat, the police found it locked from the inside. Breaking the lock, they discovered Subhash hanging from a ceiling fan with a nylon rope.Subhash’s suicide note details his ordeal, highlighting nine cases filed against him by his wife. These included accusations of murder, sexual misconduct, harassment for money,domestic violence , and dowry demands. Subhash alleged that these cases were part of a larger conspiracy to extort money from him.Shockingly, the note also implicated a principal family court judge in Uttar Pradesh’s Jaunpur and a court officer, accusing them of corruption and bribery.Throughout the suicide note, Subhash repeatedly wrote “Justice is Due.” He recorded a video narrating his alleged harassment and urged his family not to immerse his ashes until justice is served.The note included a heartfelt message for his estranged four-year-old son, whom he claimed was kept away from him. Subhash called for his parents to be granted custody of the child.The police have registered a case under the BNS Act and initiated an investigation.","Bengaluru techie Atul Subhash, 34, died by suicide in his flat on Monday.

NEW DELHI: In a significant decision, Supreme Court on Monday ruled that maintenance payable to the estranged wife and children would get priority over claims of secured, financial and operational creditors over the assets of a husband's firm facing proceedings under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Ujjal Bhuyan refused to buy the excuse of the husband that he was not earning well to pay the huge arrears of interim maintenance fixed by SC for his estranged wife and children and that his diamond factory was running in loss. ""We direct that the charge of arrears of maintenance, payable to respondents, shall have preferential right over assets of the appellant, over and above the rights of a secured creditor or similar right holders under the insolvency framework,"" it said.The bench further ordered, ""Wherever such proceedings are pending, that forum is directed to ensure that the arrears of maintenance are released to the respondents forthwith. No objection of any secured creditor, operational creditor or any other claim shall be entertained opposing the entitlement of the respondents for maintenance.""The bench justified its order by giving priority to maintenance over claims of creditors by saying, ""Right to maintenance is commensurate with right to sustenance. This right is a subset of right to dignity and a dignified life, which in turn flows from Art 21 of Constitution.""In a way, the right to maintenance being equivalent to a fundamental right will be superior to and have overriding effect than the statutory rights afforded to financial creditors, secured creditors, operational creditors or any other such claimants encompassed within the waterfall mechanism under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, or similar such laws.""SC said if the husband failed to pay arrears of maintenance to the wife, the family court ""shall take coercive action against the husband and, if so required, may auction immovable assets for purpose of recovery of arrears of maintenance"".In Nov 2022, Supreme Court had stayed a Gujarat HC order which had directed maintenance of Rs 1 lakh to the wife and Rs 50,000 each to the children and fixed the interim maintenance at Rs 50,000 to the wife and Rs 25,000 each to two children every month. The bench confirmed its interim order.The wife had pointed out to SC that though the husband was paying monthly instalment of Rs 3.7 lakh for 10 years against a Rs 5 crore loan he had taken to purchase a house, he misled SC by showing his annual income as Rs 2.5 lakh.","Supreme Court rules maintenance payable to estranged wife and children would get priority over claims of secured, financial and operational creditors.

"Rajnath meets Putin, affirms India will stand by Russia",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rajnath-meets-putin-affirms-india-will-stand-by-russia/articleshow/116186941.cms,"India and Russia reaffirmed their strategic partnership, with Defence Minister Rajnath Singh emphasizing their strong bond during a meeting with President Putin. Discussions focused on expediting S-400 deliveries, enhancing Sukhoi-30MKI maintenance, and expanding joint production of AK-203 rifles. While Russia remains India's primary arms supplier, India is diversifying its procurement.

NEW DELHI: India’s expansive strategic partnership with Russia was reinforced on Tuesday, with defence minister Rajnath Singh telling President Vladimir Putin that their “friendship is higher than the highest mountain and deeper than the deepest ocean”, while the two countries also inked a wide-ranging protocol on defence cooperation in “ongoing and prospective areas”.In his almost hour long meeting with Putin at the Kremlin, Singh also stressed that India “has always stood by its Russian friends and will continue to do so in the future”, underlining the fine balance India has struck between Russia and the US-led western countries even during the ongoing Ukraine war.“Putin and Singh were of the view that the bilateral partnership holds immense potential and their combined efforts will pave the way for remarkable outcomes,” an Indian official said.There were, of course, several concerns raised by the Indian delegation during the 21st India-Russia Inter-Governmental Commission on Military Military-Technical Cooperation (IRIGC-M&MTC) meeting, which was co-chaired by Singh and his Russian counterpart Andrey Belousov.Sources said New Delhi asked Moscow to speed up deliveries of the two remaining squadrons of the S-400 Triumf air defence missile systems as well as set up a repair and overhaul facility for them in India, while also ensuring timely deliveries, maintenance support and supply of spares for several other weapon systems and platforms, ranging from Sukhoi-30MKI fighters to T-90S main-battle tanks.Moscow was also asked to give more transfer of technology (ToT) to improve the “maintenance and sustenance” of the IAF’s existing fleet of 259 Sukhoi jets, the bulk of them produced by Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) under licence from Russia for over $12 billion.With Singh asking Russian defence industries to “explore new opportunities” to enhance their participation in `Make in India’ projects, Belousov said the operationalisation of the military technical cooperation agreement for 2021-31 will give the necessary impetus to such endeavours.Dubbing the ongoing joint production of AK-203Kalashnikov assault rifles at the Korwa ordnance factory in Amethi district of UP a “resounding success”, Singh also told Belousov that Russia must expand the production of such products in India and explore exporting them to other countries, the sources said.The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has led to a major delay in the delivery of the S-400 missile systems to India, which were contracted under the $5.43 billion (Rs 40,000 crore) contract in 2018.IAF has deployed the first three S-400 squadrons, which can detect and destroy hostile strategic bombers, jets, spy planes, missiles and drones at a range of 380-km, in north-west and east India to cater for both China and Pakistan, but is likely to get the other two units only by 2026 at the earliest.On the Sukhoi front, the procurement of another 12 of the jets is now in the pipeline to replace the ones that have crashed over the years. In Sept, the defence ministry had also inked a mega over Rs 26,000 crore contract for the procurement of 240 AL-31FP aero-engines to power the Sukhois, which will be manufactured by the Koraput Division of HAL with help from Russia.There is also a major indigenous Rs 63,000 crore upgrade plan to make the existing Sukhois much more lethal with advanced radars, avionics, longer-range weapons and multi-sensor fusion to ensure they are capable of air combat for another 30 years, as reported by TOI earlier.Russia still remains India’s main weapons supplier, accounting for over 36% of its arms imports, though New Delhi has been focussing on enhancing its own domestic defence production. India has also increasingly turned to countries like the US, France and Israel for military hardware and software over the last two decades.Around 60% of the existing inventory of the Indian armed forces, however, is still of Russian-origin, including fighters like Sukhoi-30MKIs and MiG-29s, warships like aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya, Talwar and Teg-class frigates and Kilo-class diesel-electric submarines, AN-32 medium-lift aircraft and Mi-17 helicopters, among others.","India and Russia reaffirmed their strategic partnership during a meeting with President Putin.

'Israel can learn from India the use of soft power to win war of narratives',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/israel-can-learn-from-india-the-use-of-soft-power-to-win-war-of-narratives/articleshow/116186057.cms,"Reuven Azar (Reuters photo)

On India



Gaza Ceasefire



Two-State Solution



On Syria



NEW DELHI: Israel can learn from India the use of soft power to win the war of narratives in times of conflict, Israeli ambassador to India Reuven Azar said during an interaction with TOI editors. As Israel has pressed on with its military offensive to destroy Hamas, there's been a wave of support for Palestinians in Gaza. Azar said Israel, as the only Jewish state in the region, was outnumbered in geopolitical composition.""We are the one and only Jewish state. You have very powerful media outlets that are investing billions of dollars like Al Jazeera, TRT, and many other outlets. Frankly, we haven't been investing enough because most of our investment went to hard power, not to soft power. You have been combining hard and soft power in the way that you have been challenging these groups,"" he said.As India looks to keep its relations with both Israel and Palestine on an even keel, calling repeatedly for a ceasefire in Gaza but also strongly backing Israel's right to defend itself from terrorism, Azar said the Indian govt has been supportive of Israel's ""core national interests"". Acknowledging the differences between the two sides on issues like India's continued aid to UNRWA, an agency banned by Israel, and India's voting on UNGA resolutions concerning Palestine, the ambassador said Israel shares friendly ties with India and it will continue to engage with the Indian govt on these issues.""I'm not in the business of giving grades to our friends. I think that when it comes to our core national interests, India has been pretty cooperative. Of course, we would like to see many countries, including India, changing their voting pattern. And I told our Indian friends that when it comes to UNRWA, we prefer that they divert their assistance to the needy people through other channels. So, this is a conversation we're having and we are going to continue to engage. At the end of the day, this is a very friendly relationship and we have to continue having the discussion,"" Azar said.Like last year, India released $5 million for UNRWA (UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees in Near East). The govt also informed Parliament last week that it voted in favour of 10 out of the 13 resolutions that were introduced in the UNGA since the conflict began, and abstained on 3.Azar suggested there might be some progress in negotiations for a hostage deal. The ambassador said Israel's agenda in Gaza is to destroy the military capabilities of Hamas and ensure that the group is not able to rearm itself.""For that, you need a new order in the Gaza Strip. So, that's what we are trying to achieve. To engage, to continue decimating Hamas, to engage with partners that want to work with us to restore peace. And that may take time. We want to see the release of hostages in batches at least. The PM (Benjamin Netanyahu) just met the families of the hostages and said he feels that time is ripe for a hostage deal. It seems there might be some progress in negotiations.... The bottom line is that we won't allow Hamas the possibility that in return of hostages, they will be able to take back control of the Gaza Strip.""While India and most other countries have repeatedly called for a two-state solution, Israeli Parliament Knesset voted overwhelmingly earlier this year in favour of a resolution rejecting Palestinian statehood. The ambassador said Israel wants the Palestinians to rule themselves to the extent that they can without threatening Israel.""It means that as long as you have a population that is bound to try and destroy you, you won't be able to give them full sovereignty because they will use that in order to destroy you. We tried it with the Gaza Strip. Look what happened. For 17 years, we gave a chance. And then Hamas indoctrinated their people from the age of two or three just to kill Jews. They completely took hostage all their activities just to create this capability to destroy the state of Israel. So, we have to be realistic about the degree of self-rule that Palestinians can have, unless a new generation comes that thinks differently.""Speaking about the fall of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad and its potential to further destabilise West Asia, Azar said there are three things about the geopolitical situation that are important now. ""First is that the Iranian axis is debilitated as a result of the cutting of its three tentacles (Hezbollah, Hamas and Assad). The second is what's going to happen with Russian presence in eastern Mediterranean because this is shifting balance of power between Nato and Russia. And third, this was a meticulously planned attack by the Syrian opposition that was supported, sponsored by the Turkish govt. The question is to what extent they are going to be able to stabilise the Syria situation. Don't forget that the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham comes from Jabhat al-Nusra, which was part of al-Qaida,"" Azar said.","Reuven Azar: Israel can learn from India the use of soft power to win the war of narratives in times of conflict. Indian govt has been supportive of Israel's ""core national interests"", he said. Azar suggested there might be some progress in negotiations for a hostage deal.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116186102,imgsize-352707,width-400,resizemode-4/116186102.jpg"

HYDERABAD: Telangana high court stripped Monday former BRS MLA Chennamaneni Ramesh of his Indian citizenship , declaring him a German citizen. The court also imposed a fine of Rs 30 lakh for concealing his German citizenship and misleading the judiciary. This marks the first instance of a former legislator losing Indian citizenship.Justice B Vijaysen Reddy said Ramesh's actions since 2009 had deprived genuine Indian citizens of their right to contest elections. The court upheld the Union home ministry's decision to cancel Ramesh's Indian citizenship, citing his status as a German citizen.Petitioner V Rohith, counsel for Congress functionary Adi Srinivas, argued that Ramesh had naturalised as a German citizen in the 1990s after settling in Germany, where he worked, married, and raised a family. Ramesh, a four-time MLA for Vemulawada , has had a long political career since first being elected in 2009.An inquiry revealed that Ramesh had retained his German passport and citizenship despite acquiring Indian citizenship in 2008.","Chennamaneni Ramesh, a four-time MLA for Vemulawada, has had a long political career since first being elected in 2009.

NEW DELHI: Expressing concern over growing misuse of dowry harassment provision by women against her in-laws and relatives, SC Tuesday said that any complaint without specific allegation must be nipped in bud and the law should not be allowed to be misused for arm twisting tactics by a wife and/or her family, reported.A bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and N Kotiswar Singh said that criminal proceedings on the basis of vague allegations should not be allowed in such cases. ""A mere reference to the names of family members in a criminal case arising out of a matrimonial dispute, without specific allegations indicating their active involvement should be nipped in the bud. It is a well-recognised fact, borne out of judicial experience, that there is often a tendency to implicate all the members of the husband's family when domestic disputes arise out of a matrimonial discord . Such generalised and sweeping accusations unsupported by concrete evidence or particularised allegations cannot form the basis for criminal prosecution,"" it said.SC said courts must exercise caution in such cases to prevent misuse of legal provisions and legal process & avoid unnecessary harassment of innocent family members.""Inclusion of Sec 498A of IPC by way of an amendment was intended to curb cruelty inflicted on a woman by her husband and his family, ensuring swift intervention by the State. However, in recent years, as there have been a notable rise in matrimonial disputes, accompanied by growing discord within the institution of marriage, consequently, there has been a growing tendency to misuse provisions like Section 498A of the IPC as a tool for unleashing personal vendetta against the husband and his family by a wife,"" it said.The apex court further said that it did not mean to say that any woman who has suffered cruelty should remain silent and forbear herself from making a complaint or initiating any criminal proceeding but the court should exercise caution while acting on vague allegations.",SC expresses concern over growing misuse of dowry harassment provision by women against her in-laws and relatives.

NEW DELHI: CBI Tuesday informed SC that a request for sanction to prosecute Sandip Ghosh , former principal of R G Kar Medical College & Hospital, and Dr Ashish Kumar Pandey, is pending with Bengal governmentt since November 27, though the chargesheet against them was filed two days later.For CBI, SG Tushar Mehta submitted the probe status report related to alleged financial irregularities in the Kolkata hospital, which came to light after the gruesome rape-murder of a doctor within its premises on Aug 9. SC took suo motu cognisance of the case on Aug 18. CBI has already chargesheeted Sanjay Roy, a civic volunteer, for rape-murder.Mehta said though trial against the main accused in the rape-murder case has been filed, CBI is likely to file a supplementary chargesheet after completing its probe into alleged destruction of evidence by hospital authorities in the immediate aftermath of the incident, which sparked nationwide strike by doctors.A bench of CJI Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar asked Mehta whether the chargesheet in the financial irregularities case under Prevention of Corruption Act has been filed before the same sessions court where the earlier chargesheet was lodged in the rape-murder incident. Mehta said it was filed before a CBI court, which is different from the court conducting the trial into the rape-murder incident. He said the financial irregularities chargesheet was filed on Nov 29, but the agency had sought sanction for prosecution from West Bengal government on November 27.Appearing for the state, senior advocate Kapil Sibal said, ""We have received no such communication."" Mehta said the senior advocate may not be aware of this as the request for sanctions to prosecute Ghosh and Pandey had been sent to the authority concerned in the state government on November 27.The bench asked the state to expeditiously process the request for grant of sanction to prosecute. Senior advocate Vrinda Grover, appearing for the parents of the rape-murder victim, informed the court that the trial in the case is proceeding on a day-today basis and as many as 43 of the 51 prosecution witnesses have been examined.

NEW DELHI: The massive gap in subsidies to fisherfolk - $35 (Rs 3,000) per person annually in India, compared with over $75,000 (over Rs 63 lakh) in some advanced countries, has forced government to seek a relook at the global trade negotiations and focus on per capita distribution of subsidies instead of aggregate payout.The current direction of WTO talks, which are seeking to address overfishing concerns by limiting subsidies, are seen to be skewed in favour of European nations, China and Japan. The countries, citing overall subsidy data, are seeking to cap the support in line with the current spend. This will limit the policy space for countries like India which may in future want to provide incentives. The position submitted in a paper at the trade body in Geneva are based on learnings from agriculture where the terms of trade rules favour rich nations""Adopting a per capita distribution of subsidies criterion could provide a more accurate and fair basis for managing overfishing and capacity issues, considering both stock sustainability and livelihood concerns,"" India has said. It added the annual aggregate level of fishing subsidies can't be the correct measure as they include beneficial as well as subsistence subsidies linked to livelihood, which do not contribute to overcapacity and overfishing.","$35 (Rs 3,000) per person annually in India, compared with over $75,000 (over Rs 63 lakh) in some advanced countries.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday paid tribute on Swahid Diwas , commemorating the martyrs of the Assam Movement , by highlighting their ""extraordinary courage and sacrifices"".He said efforts of the participants in the mass movement to preserve Assam's unique culture and identity serve as enduring inspiration for the state's development. ""Swahid Diwas is an occasion to remember the extraordinary courage and sacrifices of those who dedicated themselves to the Assam Movement. Their unwavering resolve and selfless efforts helped preserve Assam's unique culture and identity. Their valour also inspires us all to continue working towards a developed Assam,"" he posted on X.The Assam Movement was an upsurge against the influx of illegal Bangladeshi migrants that altered the demography in many parts of the state. His remarks underscore BJP's strategy to align itself with the legacy of the movement - led by All Assam Students' Union and All-Assam Gana Sangram Parishad and later politically represented by Asom Gana Parishad (AGP), which is now part of NDA. By invoking these sentiments, BJP seeks to connect Assamese identity with its developmental vision, reinforcing its political foothold. The movement culminated in the Assam Accord of 1985, but remains a contentious issue. AGP, born from the movement, initially gained political prominence but gradually declined due to governance challenges and unmet promises.Over the years, BJP has emerged as the dominant force in Assam, repositioning itself as the custodian of Assamese identity. Through a blend of cultural politics, the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, and an inclusive coalition approach, BJP has extended its influence across communities. Modi's focus on infrastructure and economic growth has further cemented the party's appeal. While Congress, once dominant, was perceived as indifferent to the migration issue during the movement, its subsequent inability to address voter concerns has eroded its influence in Assam.",PM Narendra Modi hails Assam Movement martyrs on Swahid Diwas.

Who is Sanjay Malhotra, the new RBI governor?

Will new RBI governor alter the monetary policy course?

Sanjay Malhotra, the revenue secretary, has been appointed as new Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor by the Narendra Modi government . Malhotra will succeed Shakikanta Das whose tenure is scheduled to end on December 10, 2024. Sanjay Malhotra will be the 26th governor of India's central bank.Malhotra will start his three-year tenure as RBI governor from December 11. He will take over from Shaktikanta Das , who has led the central bank since 2018. In the past Malhotra has served as a representative of the financial services department on the RBI board.Sanjay Malhotra, a 1990 batch Indian Administrative Service Officer from the Rajasthan Cadre, holds a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from IIT Kanpur and earned his Master's in Public Policy from Princeton University, USA.Throughout his career spanning more than 33 years, Sanjay Malhotra has served across diverse sectors, including power, finance, taxation, information technology, and mines. Currently serving as secretary (revenue) in the ministry of finance, he previously held the position of secretary in the department of financial services under the ministry of finance, Government of India.His extensive expertise encompasses finance and taxation at both state and central government levels. As a revenue secretary, he significantly contributes to formulating tax policies concerning both direct and indirect taxation systems, according to the department of revenue website.According to a Bloomberg report, Malhotra’s strong working relationship with the finance minister is expected to enhance the synchronisation of monetary and fiscal policies. During his ministry tenure, the successful rollout of the new income tax system stands as a notable accomplishment.Although Malhotra has maintained silence on monetary policy matters, he has advocated for investment growth through tax system simplification. In a recent address, he advised revenue officials to focus on economic development and be prudent when issuing substantial tax notices to businesses, particularly given the ongoing tax disagreements with major firms like Infosys Ltd.Also Read | Why did Shaktikanta Das-led MPC not cut repo rate despite GDP shocker? Top 5 points to know Malhotra will take charge during a challenging period for the central bank. The RBI faces mounting pressure to reduce interest rates, particularly as GDP growth declined to 5.4% in the July-September quarter, marking a seven-quarter low.Senior government officials from the Narendra Modi government have increasingly advocated for RBI easing. Both finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and trade minister Piyush Goyal have recently expressed concerns about the economic impact of high borrowing costs.In his final policy decision on Friday, Shaktikanta Das maintained the benchmark rate whilst implementing measures to enhance banking system liquidity, potentially supporting the decelerating economy.Das indicated that food price fluctuations, comprising approximately half of the inflation basket, would likely keep price increases elevated during October to December.CPI inflation continues to exceed the RBI's target, reaching a 14-month peak of 6.21% in October. The central bank operates under a government-mandated inflation target of 4%, with a tolerance band of plus or minus two percentage points.Analysts suggest this surprise appointment will not significantly change India's monetary policy direction.According to a Bloomberg survey, most economists anticipate the central bank will begin reducing rates in early next year.""If growth continues to underwhelm, then obviously chances of interest rate cut increases, but a February rate cut still depends on data,"" said Gaurav Kapur, an economist with IndusInd Bank Ltd.""The RBI has a history of bureaucrats becoming the governor,"" said Anubhuti Sahay, an economist with Standard Chartered Bank Plc. ""Irrespective of the governor in place, we believe India is on the round of turning point where rate cuts will have to begin.""","Sanjay Malhotra will start his three-year tenure as RBI governor from December 11. He will take over from Shaktikanta Das, who has led the central bank since 2018. He is currently serving as secretary (revenue) in the ministry of finance. He previously held the position of secretary in the department of financial services.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116141385,imgsize-46222,width-400,resizemode-4/116141385.jpg"

The capture: A tipster’s quick thinking

A calculated attack

From valedictorian to fugitive

Corporate fallout

Also Read:

A chilling breakthrough in the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson came from an unexpected place—a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania. Police arrested 26-year-old Luigi Nicholas Mangione on Monday after a restaurant employee recognized him and alerted authorities.Mangione was found with a ghost gun , a mask resembling the one worn by the shooter, and writings expressing deep resentment toward corporate America, police said. The gun is believed to be the same one used in the brazen Manhattan killing last week, which rocked the health insurance industry and raised concerns about executive security.Mangione was eating breakfast when Altoona police arrived. Along with the weapon, officers recovered fraudulent IDs, a US passport, and a suppressor linked to the murder weapon. “This individual is believed to be the person responsible for the deliberate and targeted killing of Brian Thompson,” NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said.The writings found in Mangione’s possession offered a disturbing glimpse into his mindset. A three-page manifesto revealed “ill will toward corporate America,” NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said, providing investigators with critical insight into the possible motive.Thompson, 50, was ambushed last Wednesday while walking to his hotel, where UnitedHealth Group was holding its annual investor conference. The shooter waited in hiding before firing at Thompson with a 9 mm ghost gun, a weapon assembled from untraceable parts.Evidence left in the aftermath painted a chilling picture: surveillance footage showed the masked shooter ditching a backpack in Central Park, abandoning a bike, and boarding a taxi to the George Washington Bridge Bus Station. Items recovered from the crime scene included ammunition marked with the words “delay,” “deny,” and “depose”—a grim reference to criticism of insurance practices.Mangione’s background added another layer of intrigue. A valedictorian of a prestigious Baltimore prep school and a University of Pennsylvania graduate with degrees in computer science, his life took a dark turn. Investigators linked him to addresses from Hawaii to San Francisco, and police blocked off a family property in Maryland on Monday.Photos released by the NYPD, including footage of the suspect unmasked at a Starbucks before the attack, helped generate critical tips. Law enforcement credited media coverage and the tipster’s vigilance for leading to the arrest.The high-profile killing has shaken corporate America, prompting companies to reassess security for executives and scrub personal information from websites.UnitedHealth Group released a statement following Mangione’s arrest: “We hope this brings some relief to Brian’s family, friends, and colleagues during this difficult time.”As Mangione awaits extradition to New York, the case has left lasting ripples—not only in the health insurance industry but in the uneasy intersection of public safety and corporate power.","Luigi Nicholas Mangione, 26, was arrested at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania.

Tee Higgins Contract Rumors: Joe Burrow Puts to Rest Free Agency Rumors: Tee Higgins’ Future with Bengals in 2025 Looks Bright,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/joe-burrow-puts-to-rest-free-agency-rumors-tee-higgins-future-with-bengals-in-2025-looks-bright/articleshow/116176563.cms,"Stephen Lew-USA TODAY Sports

Joe Burrow wants Higgins to stay with Bengals



Tee Higgins Response to Burrow's Statement



Tee Higgins's Season Despite Injuries



Cincinnati Bengals standout wide receiver Tee Higgins has been rumored to be on the trade block as his contract is set to expire. At the moment, he's entering the final year of his contract and is reportedly due about $21.8 million for the 2024 season. After the Bengals failed to agree on a new deal during the offseason, the team placed a franchise tag on Higgins, which would keep him with the team for at least one more year. This move sparked rumors that he could leave the Bengals after the 2024 season since teams like the New England Patriots have reportedly shown interest in signing him.Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow believes heavily in his ability to ensure Higgins remains for more than the 2024 season. Speaking like the very man confident about something and declared in that post-game press conference: ""I'm confident we're going to be able to do what it takes to get Tee back. I know I'm going to do what it takes to get him back."" So, this automatically translates that Burrow is also being involved and kept as a member in some discussion regarding the maintenance of Higgins.Ja'Marr Chase – another of the elite wide receivers of the Bengals – also was grateful to say, ""I wish I could sign Tee myself and have them with me for eternity.""When asked about Burrows' comments, Higgins seemed pretty thankful, saying, ""That's cool. That would be exciting to return here and what not,"" Higgins said. ""Shout out Joe."" He did not let the contract rumors overshadow him, focusing on his immediate role with the Bengals. One can tell Higgins is not really letting the speculation get into his head while on the field.The Bengals are in a hard financial spot, so it's hard to say that they can keep both Higgins and Ja'Marr Chase long-term. Already, the five-year, $275 million contract with Burrow has put a strain on the salary cap. With Chase up for a contract extension soon, some things could have to go-but keeping either Higgins or Chase might mean having to let go of the other.Despite missing five games this season due to injuries, Higgins has still put up good numbers in the games he's played. He has caught 45 passes for 581 yards and scored five touchdowns. Higgins has also shown consistent production in the past, having two seasons over 1,000 receiving yards. His great play, even with only limited playing time this season, shows how valuable Higgins is to the Bengals.There are rumors that teams like the New England Patriots are interested in Higgins. However, it's pretty evident that Burrow and Chase are doing everything they can to keep him in Cincinnati. The Patriots are reportedly willing to make a big offer to take Higgins away, but the words from Burrow and Chase suggest that the Bengals will do everything they can to keep him.Despite not knowing whether he's staying in Cincinnati, Higgins and the Bengals are more concerned with what lies immediately ahead as the team remains in the hunt for the playoffs. Four games left in the season remain, and finishing strong to secure a playoff spot is at the forefront of the Bengals' minds. Contract talks and the offseason will have to wait until after the end.Also read - Travis Kelce Helps Teens Turn an Abandoned Chevelle into a Life-Changing Project",Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Tee Higgins has been rumored to be on the trade block as his contract is set to expire.

"Who is Luigi Mangione, suspect in the UnitedHealth CEO shooting?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-luigi-mangione-suspect-in-the-unitedhealth-ceo-shooting/articleshow/116154879.cms,"Luigi Mangione comes from a wealthy family in Maryland and is an Ivy League graduate from the University of Pennsylvania.

Valedictorian at his $37,000-a-year all-boys prep school. Founder of a gaming club and graduate at an Ivy League university. A rapidly ascending data engineer at TrueCar Inc.Luigi Nicholas Mangione was all that. And now, he is also the suspect in the coldblooded killing of insurance executive Brian Thompson , a 50-year-old father of two gunned down last week in Midtown Manhattan.To some, Mangione — if he is indeed the killer — represents a folk hero acting on the collective rage of a nation against the perceived faults of the insurance industry. Others see him as the face of a country where law and order has broken down, morality has collapsed and company executives are scapegoated with deadly consequences for systemic inequities.Mangione, 26, was arrested by the police in Altoona, Pennsylvania, on Monday after authorities were alerted to a “suspicious male” who looked like the person wanted for the shooting of the UnitedHealth Group Inc executive December 4.He was found with a homemade gun and a manifesto, which a person familiar with the matter described as anti-capitalist and critical of health-care companies’ profit motives. It said he acted alone and was self-funded, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential matters and declined to elaborate.Mangione appeared in court in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania, for a preliminary arraignment for charges on five counts, including forgery, carrying a gun without a license and showing law enforcement false identification, according to a criminal complaint released by the state court system. Details on a lawyer for Mangione weren’t immediately available.A survey of his online presence shows Mangione — who attended the University of Pennsylvania — praised the manifesto of another Ivy League graduate known for violent acts aimed at corporate targets, the Unabomber, calling his insights “prescient” on the book-review website Goodreads.By all accounts, Mangione appears to have had a privileged upbringing in Maryland, the product of a wealthy family with various business interests. His mother is a travel agent, and he had ties across the country and the world, most recently living in Honolulu.He attended the prestigious Gilman School in Baltimore and graduated as valedictorian in 2016. In his valedictory address, Mangione highlighted his classmates’ innovative spirit.“Having great ideas, however, isn’t enough,” he said. “The class of 2016’s inventiveness also stems from its incredible courage to explore the unknown and try new things.”At the University of Pennsylvania, he earned both bachelor’s and master’s degrees in engineering, computer and information science in 2020. He also founded the university’s first video-game development club. “Our goal is to have fun and learn,” Mangione told The Daily Pennsylvanian.The summer before he graduated, he worked as the head counselor and an artificial intelligence teaching assistant at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, designing lesson plans and teaching high school students. The work involved supervising more than three dozen students, according to his LinkedIn account. He helped create an “inclusive, fun, and stimulating” community among the residential staff, he wrote.He began working as a data engineer at TrueCar in November 2020, and garnered his first promotion less than a year later. By October 2022, he was a data engineer III, working across more than a dozen technologies on lease and loan payments, pricing data sources and performance tracking. (His employment with TrueCar ended in 2023, the company said. It declined to provide any additional information.)Mangione was taken into custody at a McDonald’s restaurant after an employee reported a resemblance to the suspect in the nationwide manhunt. He had what appeared to be a ghost gun, made using a 3D printer to circumvent any paperwork or legal details involved in purchasing a firearm. It fired the same type of bullet that killed Thompson, though ballistics testing was still pending, said Joseph Kenny, the chief of New York Police Department detectives.Mangione’s social media posting provided some insight into his life. He left reviews of Surfbreak and the Hub on the Hawaiian island of Oahu, praising the “community of travelers and entrepreneurs” at Surfbreak, a co-living space, and said the Hub, a co-working site, was a “warm, energizing place.”“Both memberships have enabled me to meet so many interesting people, and the combination of the two has provided the perfect balance of work and life,” according to the review he posted as @luig.man.Fun and enjoyment were paramount for Mangione, from his days at Stanford, to the video-game club he founded at Penn, to his living situation in Hawaii. But then, seemingly, things may have changed.On Goodreads, Mangione posted a positive review in June 2021 of Industrial Society and Its Future by Theodore Kaczynski, a mathematician and Harvard University graduate who became a domestic terrorist known as the Unabomber.It would be easy to write it off “as the manifesto of a lunatic,” in order to avoid facing some of the uncomfortable problems it identifies, Mangione wrote. “But it’s simply impossible to ignore how prescient many of his predictions about modern society turned out.”“He was a violent individual — rightfully imprisoned — who maimed innocent people,” Mangione wrote. “While these actions tend to be characterized as those of a crazy luddite, however, they are more accurately seen as those of an extreme political revolutionary.”Traffic on social media accounts seemed to indicate that family members were trying to locate Mangione as recently as two weeks ago, though it wasn’t possible to verify the accuracy of the posts which have since been taken down by X. Others speculated about a possible surfing accident and unsuccessful back surgery, which also went unconfirmed.The Goodreads account in his name lists at least five books about chronic back pain and fitness, and his X account banner features an X-ray image of a lower back with spinal screws that are often inserted during surgery.Such operations are notoriously difficult and often ineffective. They can also be hard to get in some instances, as some studies show the pain may ease with time and insurance companies crack down on the use of procedures and medications that can come with serious complications.Patients are increasingly frustrated with the role that insurers play as gatekeepers for certain types of medical procedures, according to Wendell Potter, a former Cigna Group communications executive who has written books that are critical of the industry. Some become especially distressed as they wait for approval of treatment for conditions that can cause extreme pain and loss of work, Potter said.“One of the biggest reasons that people have to access the health-care system is because of back and joint pain,” he said. “It can be expensive, and there are a lot of surgeries that are either delayed for one reason or another that should have taken place, or that have been approved and that weren’t necessary.”While the effectiveness of surgery for back pain is somewhat controversial, “the insurance companies put themselves in the position of being the decision-maker here, and that may not be an appropriate role for them,” he said. “You often have someone at an insurance company making a determination that runs contrary to what a patient’s doctor says a patient needs.”Social media on Monday evening was full of praise for Mangione, with Luigi the top trending topic on X and FREE HIM coming in at No. 7. #FreeLuigi gained traction on Instagram. The McDonald’s in Altoona, where Mangione was caught, also was hit by one-star reviews after the arrest, with one poster criticizing the “class traitor” who turned him in and another calling him “one of the brightest minds of our generation.”","Luigi Nicholas Mangione, 26, is the suspect in the killing of insurance executive Brian Thompson.

Mike Tyson sued for $1.5 million after alleged contract breach before Jake Paul fight,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/boxing/mike-tyson-sued-for-1-5-million-after-alleged-contract-breach-before-jake-paul-fight/articleshow/116162934.cms,"Mike Tyson vs Jake Paul (Agency Photo)

NEW DELHI: Former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson is facing a legal battle with a Cyprus-based company called Medier, which promotes the betting company Rabona. Medier has filed a lawsuit against Tyson and his company, Tyrannic, in the High Court of London, seeking more than $1.5 million in damages.The lawsuit alleges that Tyson wrongfully terminated a promotional contract signed in January, in order to pursue a fight against the influencer Jake Paul , which was sponsored by Netflix.According to the filing, Medier claims that Tyson cited a breach of agreement on their part as the reason for terminating the deal in March, but the ""true reason"" was the opportunity to fight Paul.Medier is seeking the return of more than $800,000 in fees paid to Tyson, for which they claim no services were provided, as well as $729,000 in ""wasted production and promotion costs.""The lawsuit states that Tyson's decision to terminate the contract was ""hasty and unlawful.""Tyson's lawyers, on the other hand, argue that Medier breached the contract by failing to obtain Tyson's approval of promotional materials, as required by the agreement.The legal dispute arises from Tyson's highly publicized exhibition bout against Jake Paul last month, which took place in front of more than 70,000 fans at the home of the NFL's Dallas Cowboys. Paul won the eight-round fight by unanimous decision, and the event was streamed live on Netflix, reportedly earning Tyson $20 million.While the details of the contractual obligations and alleged breaches are yet to be fully examined in court, the lawsuit highlights the complexities and potential conflicts that can arise in high-profile promotional deals and sporting events.","Mike Tyson is facing a legal battle with a Cyprus-based company called Medier.
