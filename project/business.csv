Academic autonomy is under threat. At least in some states of India where the public university and colleges under it seem to be on the warpath over freedom. Of the 45,000-plus colleges across India, only about 995 are autonomous.The University Grants Commission (UGC) has been promoting autonomy for decades. But it has been an arduous long walk to self-rule.For one, autonomy is not uniformly spread across the country: states like Jharkhand, Manipur, Rajasthan and Goa have the lowest count of autonomous colleges with the largest pool in Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh.Secondly, academic autonomy in its truest sense is still uncommon, even though it is a proven fact that academic autonomy has an impact on performance in higher education . It is supposed to allow colleges to function without undue interference, allowing them to do what they do best: offer courses, alter curricula, innovate in teaching-learning and evaluate smartly. Yet, there are not many takers for it.From political interference and universities unwilling to let go of their powers to a sheer lack of ambition and confidence in going independent, colleges across the country are reluctant or slow to turn autonomous for a variety of reasons. This despite the fact of UGC’s repeated prodding of the states to encourage colleges to embrace independence.A recent note speaks volumes about what is taking place on the ground. “...Some universities do not allow complete autonomy to the autonomous colleges in the matter of designing syllabus, introduction of new courses, and evolving methods of assessment of students’ performance etc. as per provisions of the regulations. Certain universities ask the colleges to sign a MoU/agreement having terms and conditions against the provisions of the UGC regulations,” it said.Several principals in Kerala said universities discourage affiliated colleges from becoming autonomous as they “don’t want a high per forming college to move out from their ambit”. Given limited flexibility, colleges are not permitted to start new programmes or change the existing syllabus by more than 20%. Autonomous institutes are also penalised disproportionately for oversights such as misspelt names in result sheets.Worse still, despite all instructions having been fulfilled, universities often do not give approval to start new programmes or put colleges through a long-winding process that can take years. Several autonomous colleges have now approached Kerala High Court in order to obtain approval for new programmes. But even after HC’s nod, a college will have to pay high fees for getting the syllabus approved. For example, Mahatma Gandhi University charges Rs 57,890 for UG programmes and Rs 1.2 lakh for approving PG programmes from autonomous colleges.But it is the students that are the real sufferers in a clash of academic institutions. For instance, an autonomous college in north Kerala started five new undergraduate pro grammes in 2022, strictly adhering to UGC regulations of 2018 and submitting all necessary documents to the University of Calicut. Students admitted in those programmes have entered their fourth semester. But the university has yet to take any steps to give affiliation to or recognise these programmes. Since these programmes are not included in the university’s database, the college fears that the students admitted to these courses may be denied degree certificates after completing their course.Worse still, as the college doesn’t have the university’s certificate of affiliation for the five new programmes, NAAC has now sought a clarification from the college in this matter.Such examples point to the difficulties inherent in negotiating an autonomous path for colleges. Given the disconnect between university education and the jobs market, innovative courses through industry and sectoral linkages are clearly the need of the day. However, with state-run universities unwilling to ease up on their jurisdictional powers, the process of reform is likely to remain slow.Though autonomous colleges conduct exams, the degree certiﬁcate is awarded by the university. While results of examinations are published and intimated to the universities, there is a delay in issuing provisional and original degree certiﬁcates to autonomous colleges, which are penalised for minor mistakes, too. For instance, the university can impose a ﬁne of upto Rs 6,000 if a student’s name is misspelt by a college while the mistake is corrected only after much back and forth. Non-autonomous colleges are ﬁned Rs 50 and the mistake is immediately corrected.The faculty of an autonomous college is expected to attend the university’s evaluation camps. In case they don’t, an explanation is sought. “Our teachers are also asked to do double duty,” a college in Thrissur district wrote to UGC. It said they have to evaluate papers for the college, and also of university students studying in afﬁliated colleges that are not autonomous.Proposal by an autonomous college for a new course that is not offered by the university has to be ﬁrst presented to the college’s board of studies, which has a university nominee. Then, it is presented before its academic council, which has three university nominees. For ﬁnal approval, it is presented before the college’s governing body, which has a university nominee and a state govt nominee. Yet, when the revised syllabus is forwarded to the university, there is a reluctance to clear it. One reason being that there is often no university board of studies that can study the proposal, thus leaving the college in limbo.A university charges a one time afﬁliation fee/annual afﬁliation for existing programmes. But Calicut University charges higher fees for self-ﬁnancing courses. While the fees for self ﬁnancing courses introduced by autonomous colleges is Rs 1.2 lakh, for govt-aided programmes it is Rs 33,090.","Of the 45,000-plus colleges across India, only about 995 are autonomous.

"Maharashtra set to clear Rel Infra arm's Rs 1,700crore Metro debt",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maharashtra-set-to-clear-rel-infra-arms-rs-1700crore-metro-debt/articleshow/111500957.cms,"MUMBAI: The Eknath Shinde govt may have shelved its plans to acquire Metro 1, but the state cabinet has directed MMRDA 's executive committee to consider clearing, by way of a one-time settlement , the Rs 1,700 crore debt owed by Mumbai Metro One Pvt Ltd ( MMOPL ) to its lenders.Metro 1, the oldest in Mumbai which currently serves 4.6 lakh passengers daily, is the only corridor executed through a public-private partnership.It is run by a special purpose vehicle, the Reliance Infrastructure-promoted MMOPL. MMRDA has a 26% stake in the SPV, while Anil Ambani 's R-Infra holds 74%.There are six lenders in all: State Bank of India, IDBI Bank, Canara Bank, Indian Bank, Bank of Maharashtra, and IIFCL (UK).In March 2024, MMOPL signed a debt settlement agreement with the lenders, committing to pay Rs 1,700 crore as one-time settlement of its entire debt. As part of the agreement, MMRDA and MMOPL made upfront payment of Rs 171 crore to the lenders.On March 11, the state cabinet had cleared purchase of R-Infra's 74% stake in Metro-1 for Rs 4,000 crore by MMRDA. The buyout would have allowed MMOPL to exit the project. However, MMRDA said it could not finance the acquisition and requested state funding, which was denied, leading the state cabinet to reverse its purchase decision recently.Now, at a June 26 cabinet meeting, sources said, it was decided to ask MMRDA's executive committee ""to discuss the issue of the one-time settlement."" MMRDA was directed to take immediate action for implementation of the cabinet move, sources added.The MMRDA commissioner will soon convene a meeting with all six lenders of MMOPL to deliberate on the matter. Between April 2023 and June 2024, MMOPL has regularly paid interest to the lenders amounting to over Rs 225 crore.MMOPL was facing insolvency proceedings in the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). IDBI Bank initiated insolvency proceedings in Oct 2023 over dues of Rs 133.37 crore, while SBI followed in Aug 2023 due to defaults amounting to Rs 416 crore. NCLT disposed of the insolvency cases after MMRDA paid Rs 170 crore, which is 10% of the one-time settlement amount.When contacted, an MMOPL spokesperson declined to comment. MMRDA officials were also unavailable for comment.Officials clarified that Metro Line 1, constructed at a cost of Rs 2,356 crore, was not making operational losses, but the financially troubled Anil Ambani group wanted to exit the project.The concession agreement between MMRDA and MMOPL was signed in 2007, and the corridor became operational in 2014.MMOPL was also engaged in arbitration against MMRDA over cost escalation during construction of Metro Line 1. While MMOPL claims it cost Rs 4,026 crore to build Metro Line 1, MMRDA maintains the cost is Rs 2,356 crore as per the original contract."," MMRDA has a 26% stake in the SPV, while Anil Ambani's R-Infra holds 74%.

The Prime Minister is appointed by the President but must enjoy the confidence of the majority in the Lok Sabha.India has had 14 Prime Ministers since 1947, starting with Jawaharlal Nehru.Notably, Indira Gandhi was the first female Prime Minister, and the Nehru-Gandhi family has held the position for approximately 38 years. Various political parties have held power, with leaders like Morarji Desai, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, and Manmohan Singh shaping India's political landscape. Narendra Modi, of the BJP, has served as Prime Minister since 2014, winning consecutive terms in 2019 and 2024, becoming the second after Nehru to do so.","India has had 14 Prime Ministers since 1947, starting with Jawaharlal Nehru.

Sonia Gandhi's nudge puts Hemant Soren back in Jharkhand saddle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/sonia-gandhis-nudge-puts-hemant-soren-back-in-jharkhand-saddle/articleshow/111500162.cms,":

RANCHIHemant Soren was back in the saddle Thursday for a third stint as Jharkhand CM after an unannounced 5pm swearing-in bereft of ceremony and purportedly hastened by a prod from Congress’s parliamentary chairperson Sonia Gandhi .The former Congress president, whom Hemant called on June 30 after getting bail in the Ranchi land scam case two days earlier, is said to have convinced him to take charge quickly “in the interest of clarity within the JMM-led coalition”.Hemant will seek a floor test during a one-day assembly session scheduled for July 8 and expand his cabinet thereafter, JMM said.Both Raj Bhavan and the JMM rank and file had been given to understand after stand-in CM Champai Soren ’s resignation Wednesday that Hemant would prefer to take the oath of office on June 7.The apparent change in plan was conveyed to governor C P Radhakrishnan’s secretariat Thursday morning and made public barely two hours before the swearing-in.JMM said 5pm was an ""auspicious mahurat"" for Hemant's return. Since it was too late to send out invitations, the event at Raj Bhavan's Durbar Hall took place before an audience of barely 100 people, including the three-time CM's predecessor.""He (Hemant) had been asked to intimate a date and time for the swearing-in. On Thursday morning, we received a letter saying the new CM would like to take oath at 5 pm, and it was arranged accordingly,"" a Raj Bhavan official said.ED's plan to move Supreme Court against Jharkhand high court's acceptance of Hemant's bail plea may have been a factor in Hemant advancing the swearing-in.When they spoke last week, Sonia apparently told Hemant that the only way to prevent ""dual power centres"" was for him to take back the chief ministership.Hemant first became CM in July 2013, retaining the post till Dec 2014. His second stint started on Dec 29, 2019, but was cut short hours before his arrest on Jan 31 this year. Champai, whom he picked as his successor, took over on Feb 2.Hemant's father and JMM patriarch Shibu Soren, his newly elected MLA wife Kalpana Murmu Soren, Jharkhand Congress president Rajesh Thakur, former ministers of Champai's cabinet, and MLAs of INDIA bloc attended the swearing-in.Hemant and his wife visited Sidho-Kanhu Park in Morabadi later to pay tributes to tribal revolutionaries Sidho and Kanhu Murmu.""They (NDA) tried to stop our march by hatching a conspiracy and development projects stalled for a few months. Now that I am back, all my decisions will be for Adivasis, Moolvasis and people from every strata of the society,"" Hemant said.Champai congratulated Hemant on becoming CM through a post on X.While JMM is likely to retain most ministers from Champai's cabinet, Latehar MLA Baidyanath Ram could be among the new faces, sources said.""Congress, too, is likely to induct new faces. The ministers will be picked with the high command's approval,"" a Congress functionary said.","JMM said 5pm was an ""auspicious mahurat"" for Hemant's return.

"It's payback time, TDP chief Naidu tells Centre with his wish list",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/its-payback-time-tdp-chief-naidu-tells-centre-with-his-wish-list/articleshow/111498214.cms,"NEW DELHI: Just weeks after the NDA govt was sworn in, Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu , who heads TDP, the second largest member of the coalition, came calling to the Capital with a long wish list — from short-term funds to additional capex support for infrastructure, money for the capital city of Amaravati and a new oil refinery — suggesting that some of the announcements be made in the Union Budget Sources in AP govt described the meeting between PM Narendra Modi and Naidu as “very positive and focussed on positive outcomes for the state”, and refrained from stating whether there was any demand for a package.“The CM highlighted how Andhra is grappling with the repercussions of the unfair and unjust bifurcation of 2014. Additionally, the miserable governance of the previous administration marked by malice, corruption and mis-governance has dealt a more deleterious blow to the state than the bifurcation,” said a source.During his meet with the PM, Naidu sought Centre’s “financial handholding” to tide over the crisis and focus on investments in specific projects and backward regions. He argued that there was “no other way to face such a challenge”.The list of items for which Naidu has sought the Centre’s “cooperation” runs into several pages — covering short-term assistance as well as an additional allocation under the Scheme for Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment, meant to build core infrastructure.Besides, project-specific support to build the govt complex and trunk infrastructure in Amaravati, which was chosen by Naidu to be the capital after the loss of Hyderabad to Telangana, the Polavaram irrigation project and development of Duggirajupatnam port also figure in the list.Naidu also met home minister Amit Shah, road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal, oil minister Hardeep Puri, power minister Manohar Lal, agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and 16th Finance Commission chairman Arvind Panagariya and had specific demands from each of them, including projects and release of funds that are due to the state.For instance, when he met Puri, he demanded that state-run BPCL set up an oil refinery in the state, in line with the AP Reorganisation Act of 2014, and suggested that an announcement by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman would “augur well” for increasing the refinery capacity in the country.During his meeting with the home minister, the Andhra CM flagged division of assets with Telangana as an issue, along with bifurcation of several institutions and a resolution of financial issues between APGENCO, the power generation company, and Telangana power discoms.Similarly, Naidu suggested to Manohar Lal that Vizag Kakinada should be promoted as a green hydrogen hub and sought Gadkari’s help for road projects. In his meeting with Goyal, he sought grants for building infrastructure in four industrial nodes.","Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu came calling to the Capital with a long wish list.

"Isolate and expose States that back terrorism, PM Modi tells SCO",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/isolate-and-expose-states-that-back-terrorism-pm-modi-tells-sco/articleshow/111496160.cms,"PM Narendra Modi ’s address to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation ( SCO ), the security-oriented Eurasian bloc which held its annual summit in Astana Thursday, was replete with messages to Pakistan and China as he sought a decisive response against cross-border terrorism - calling upon all to shun double standards – and backed connectivity linkages that respect territorial integrity .Modi did not participate in the summit but, in remarks delivered through foreign minister S Jaishankar who filled in for him, he sought to allay apprehensions about India’s commitment to the group saying in a world moving inexorably towards real multipolarity, the SCO will only become more important and that it occupies a prominent place in India’s foreign policy. However, he added its true value would depend on how well the member-states cooperate amongst themselves.Without naming Pakistan, the PM called for action to isolate and expose countries that harbour terrorists, provide safe havens and condone terrorism. ``Cross-border terrorism requires a decisive response and terrorism financing and recruitment must be resolutely countered. We should also take proactive steps to prevent the spread of radicalization among our youth,’’ he said, adding if left unaddressed, cross-border terrorism can become a major threat to regional and global peace.Significantly, while strongly condemning terrorism, SCO’s joint statement called upon the international community to seek consensus on the adoption within the UN of a Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism (CCIT) as an “important contribution to the existing base of universal international counter-terrorism instruments”. CCIT was first proposed by India to UNGA in 1996 but it couldn’t be adopted because of differences over the definition of terrorism.Addressing the participating leaders, including Chinese President Xi Jinping and Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif, Modi said terrorism ranks foremost for many member-states as it continues to be used by nations as a tool of destabilization. Reminding the Organisation that combating terrorism was one of its original goals, Modi said that the SCO must never waver in its commitment. ``We cannot have double standards in this regard,’’ he said, in remarks aimed at China, which has blocked UN ban on Pakistan based operatives of proscribed terror groups.In another message to China and Pakistan, he reiterated India’s position that connectivity and infrastructure projects must not undermine sovereignty and territorial integrity. India remains the only SCO member-state to not endorse China’s BRI because its ``flagship’’ project CPEC passes through Gilgit-Baltistan in PoK. India was also the only member-state to not endorse the SCO Economic Development Strategy 2030 announced last year.Modi said connectivity linkages must be respectful of sovereignty and territorial integrity of states and be built on the foundation of non-discriminatory trade and transit rights to neighbours. Pakistan continues to deny India land access to Afghanistan and Central Asia. Modi mentioned the progress made on Chabahar port recently in the form of a long-term agreement between India and Iran, saying it not only holds great value for landlocked Central Asian states but also de-risks commerce between India and Eurasia.The PM said that SCO is a principle-based organization, whose consensus drives the approach of its member states. ``At this time, it is particularly noteworthy that we are reiterating mutual respect for sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity, equality, mutual benefit, non-interference in internal affairs, non-use of force or threat of use of force as a basis for our foreign policies. We have also agreed not to take any measures contrary to the principles of state sovereignty and territorial integrity,’’ he said, while expressing hope for a consensus in the group on the need for reform of the current global order, including the UNSC.","PM Narendra Modi did not participate in the summit but delivered remarks through foreign minister S Jaishankar.

"Redouble disengagement efforts, LAC peace essential: Jaishankar to Wang",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/redouble-disengagement-efforts-lac-peace-essential-jaishankar-to-wang/articleshow/111496177.cms,"Foreign minister S Jaishankar in a meeting with his counterpart Wang Yi called for redoubling military and diplomatic efforts to achieve complete disengagement in the remaining areas in eastern Ladakh, as India and China agreed the prolongation of the current situation in the border areas is not in the interest of either side. Jaishankar told Wang respecting LAC and restoring border peace and tranquillity is essential for removing obstacles towards return of normalcy in Sino-Indian bilateral relationship, which PM Narendra Modi recently described as important for the entire region and the world.Jaishankar met Wang on the margins of the SCO summit in Astana Thursday.While they met briefly at the Munich Security Conference in February this year, their last formal bilateral meeting was in Jakarta in July 2023.In line with China’s position that progress in bilateral ties is not stymied by the border issue, Wang sought ``positive thinking’’ in the form of efforts on one hand to manage the situation in the border areas and, on the other, to ``actively resume’’ normal exchanges on the other. This never sat well with India’s position that there can’t be normalcy till the time disengagement is fully completed in eastern Ladakh.India and China have achieved disengagement at 4 points in the western sector, since the ongoing standoff erupted in May 2020, but the same has remained elusive in Depsang and Demchok areas even after 21 rounds of military and 15 rounds of diplomatic talks . China sees these as legacy issues that predate the current standoff.During the ``in-depth’’ exchange of views for early resolution and rebuilding of ties, Jaishankar reaffirmed the importance of fully abiding by relevant bilateral agreements, protocols, and understandings reached between the two governments in the past. ``The Line of Actual Control must be respected and peace and tranquillity in the border areas always ensured,’’ said the Indian side in its readout, adding India and China agreed to step up meetings to address the remaining issues. Another round of diplomatic talks is expected soon.Jaishankar reiterated India’s position that mutual respect, mutual sensitivity and mutual interest – the 3 mutuals – will guide bilateral ties.Before Modi opted out, the SCO summit was seen as the first opportunity for both sides to consider a meeting between him and President Xi Jinping, who have not had a formal bilateral meeting since 2019, after the return of the NDA government. The leaders, who did meet informally at the BRICS summit in Johannesburg last year and at G20 in Bali 2022, are now expected to come face to face only in October at the BRICS summit in Russia in October. While discussing regional and global situations, Jaishankar also told Wang India will support China’s upcoming presidency of SCO.After an 18-month hiatus, the longest since the restoration of ambassadorial relations in 1976, China finally appointed a new ambassador to India, Xu Feihong, in May this year. In April this year, in an interview to Newsweek, Modi called for urgently addressing the prolonged situation on the border to do away with the abnormality in ties, adding stable and peaceful relations between India and China are important for not just the 2 countries but the entire region and world.According to a Chinese readout, Jaishankar told Wang India follows an independent foreign policy, the concept of multilateralism, and will safeguard the common interests of developing countries.``China and India, both countries in the ""Global South"", should work together to oppose unilateral bullying, resist camp confrontation, safeguard the common interests of developing countries, and make due contributions to regional and world peace, stability and development,’’ said the Chinese statement.",India and China agreed the prolongation of the current situation in the border areas is not in the interest of either side.

Distributed Exams: Distributed Exams to Prevent Paper Leaks: AIU President,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/distributed-exams-to-prevent-paper-leaks-aiu-president/articleshow/111497890.cms,"NEW DELHI: Advocating for “distributed exams”, the new president of the Association of Indian Universities (AIU), Vinay Pathak , has emphasised that “over-centralisation” of any test can lead to significant adverse issues and a single exam should not determine the future of a student.In light of the NEET-UG controversies and paper leaks , and the decision to revert to the pen-and-paper mode for UGC-NET and CUET-UG, Pathak, also the vice-chancellor of Chhatrapati Shahu Ji Maharaj University (formerly Kanpur University), in an exclusive interaction with TOI, discussed the future of exams .He advocated for technology-driven adaptive testing, similar to the GRE and TOEFL, as a “progressive solution”. He also stressed that in addition to entrance tests, university admissions should incorporate multiple evaluation methods, including Board exam scores, group discussions, and personal interviews.While the govt considers adopting a JEE-style online test format for entrance exams conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA), Pathak highlighted the drawbacks of centralisation. “Over-centralising exams, where a single test determines a student’s future, is fraught with risks. In engineering, for instance, moving from single-threaded to distributed systems improved reliability because if one part fails, others can still function. Similarly, decentralised exams could localise the impact of any single point of failure, like a paper leak,” he said.Pathak highlighted adaptive testing as a promising solution, explaining that it adjusts to the test-taker’s ability level in real time. “Technologies like AI can create personalised tests that are both secure and fair. Tests like the GRE and TOEFL have successfully implemented adaptive testing, minimising the chances of leaks and ensuring a more accurate assessment of student abilities,” he said.Limiting students to a single exam can be detrimental, leading to undue stress and even mental health issues, Pathak pointed out. “That’s why you’re seeing lots of depression during medical entrance tests and many suicides. While multiple exams have their own pressures, they also release pressure differently,” he added.Multiple chances allows students to perform to their potential across, mitigating the impact of a bad day. “Exams like JEE-Mains, which now allow multiple attempts, provide a useful model,” he said.Pathak stressed that admissions based on a single entrance test score are not ideal. Instead, he suggested that “a comprehensive evaluation system should combine various metrics, including standardised test scores, academic performance, recommendations, and personal interviews. This approach, used by top universities globally, offers a more rounded assessment of a student’s capabilities.” He pointed out that entrance exams currently test whether students know what the examiner knows, not what the students know.Regarding the recent issues of paper leaks and irregularities in major exams, Pathak emphasised the importance of maintaining the integrity of the exam process. “Public trust in the system can be bolstered by transparency and consistent performance from testing agencies. As seen with exams like JEE Advanced and UPSC, when the process is perceived as fair, it garners respect and confidence from students and society alike,” he said.","Vinay Pathak is the new president of the Association of Indian Universities. In light of the NEET-UG controversies and paper leaks, Pathak discussed the future of exams. He advocated for technology-driven adaptive testing, similar to the GRE and TOEFL.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111500090,imgsize-18296,width-400,resizemode-4/111500090.jpg"

NEW DELHI: India and Australia on Thursday discussed closer collaboration in the Indo-Pacific region , as part of their expanding strategic ties , during a telephonic talk between defence minister Rajnath Singh and his counterpart Richard Marles.A range of issues pertaining to bilateral defence cooperation were reviewed, including the need for greater cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, in the backdrop of China’s expansionist muscle-flexing in the region.“We place great value on the India-Australia comprehensive strategic partnership,” Singh said.The two ministers noted the “transformative progress” in defence cooperation and the momentum achieved in the ties since the last bilateral two-plus-two ministerial dialogue in Nov 2023. Australia has described India as a top-tier security partner in its National Defence Strategy document released earlier this year.During the dialogue, India and Australia decided to strengthen their overall defence-strategic ties, including cooperation in information exchange, maritime domain awareness and niche areas like AI, cyber, anti-submarine and anti-drone warfare. Marles had then stressed that China was “the biggest security anxiety” for both India and his country, while also being their largest trading partner.","India and Australia discussed closer collaboration in the Indo-Pacific region.

"Agnipath will 'degrade' combat power & operational efficiency of military, say several officers & veterans",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/agnipath-will-degrade-combat-power-operational-efficiency-of-military-say-several-officers-veterans/articleshow/111500969.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amid the political slugfest over compensation paid to Agniveers who die in the line of duty, several serving military officers and veterans say the overriding critical concern that the Agnipath scheme will “degrade” combat effectiveness and operational efficiency is being ignored despite the clear and present threats posed by China and Pakistan.It takes seven to eight years for a soldier, sailor and airman to become fully combat-ready, with the requisite hands-on experience, but 75% of the Agniveers from each batch will be demobilised after four years under the scheme rolled out in June 2022.While this will especially hit the IAF and Navy, which are more technology-intensive, the Army will also be impacted. “The very nature of warfare is changing with rapid technological advances. Why should the armed forces spend precious time and money training Agniveers to handle sophisticated weapon systems, missiles and machinery when the bulk of them will go after four years,” a top officer told TOI.Moreover, the over-stretched Army is already facing a shortage of combat-ready soldiers, which will get further accentuated with each passing year without tweaks in the Agnipath scheme. Around 60,000 soldiers retire every year, while the annual intake of Agniveers is limited to 40,000 at present.Given that the govt is unlikely to scrap the radical Agnipath scheme, which is primarily aimed at slashing the ballooning salary and pension bills, the armed forces want the retention rate of Agniveers to be raised to at least 50-60% from the existing 25%, among other tweaks, based on surveys and feedback from their units.Admiral K B Singh, who retired as the Navy chief in Nov 2021, in a post on ‘X’ on Thursday, said, “The only motivation driving Agnipath is reducing the pension bill. The fact that this scheme will degrade combat effectiveness is known to all who understand national security.”Another former Navy chief, Admiral Arun Prakash (retd), in turn, said “Economics (must) take a back seat to national security. The sole litmus test for any change or reform in the military must be: “Does it enhance or degrade combat effectiveness?”There should be concern about the “huge operational handicap” being imposed on combat units forced to accept “barely trained recruits fit only for sentry duties”, he added. Agniveers, incidentally, receive a truncated basic training of six months instead of the around 11 months for regular soldiers earlier.Other military chiefs and top officers also criticise Agnipath on several counts. Former Army chief Gen M M Naravance, who retired in April 2022, of course, has already said the Army had initially proposed only “a limited number (10%)” of jawans should be enrolled for the short-term service.But the PMO directed that not only should the entire intake (100%) be on a short-service basis, but it would apply to IAF and Navy as well. Later, the Army also argued that 75% of the recruited jawans should be retained, but to no avail.A senior Army officer said the Agnipath scheme was already creating “fissures in the all-important cohesion, camaraderie and regimental spirit” of battalions. “There are now two classes of soldiers, the Agniveers and the regular ones with higher salaries and annual leaves as well as pensions. There is also unhealthy competition emerging among Agniveers to prove their suitability to be retained as regular soldiers. If the Constitution can be amended over 100 times, what is the harm in tweaking Agnipath?” he said.","It takes seven to eight years for a soldier, sailor and airman to become fully combat-ready. 75% of the Agniveers from each batch will be demobilised after four years under the scheme rolled out in June 2022.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111500964,imgsize-92260,width-400,resizemode-4/111500964.jpg"

In lieu of the land, the state govt, he said, would transfer the state govt land 2,462 acres, to Research Centre Imarat permanently, which is on lease.The CM along with deputy CM Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka met the PM Narendra Modi on Friday with a list of 12 requests on the issues like allocation of coal blocks to Singareni, sanctioning houses, steel plant, IIM, revival of Information Technology and Investment Region (ITIR), backward region grants and other issues.Ahead of the full union budget to be presented, the CM asked for sanction of houses under PM Awas Yojana and include Telangana in the semiconductor mission.The CM said some defence lands are required for construction of two elevated corridors Hyderabad-Karimnagar and Hyderabad-Nagpur (national highways 44).As the Centre has decided to auction coal blocks in various states and one coal block at Sravanpally included in it, Revanth Reddy urged the PM to allocate coal blocks directly as it is a Telangana public sector undertaking (PSU) with 51% share to Telangana and 49% of the share to the Centre and remove Sravanpally from the auction list and allocate other blocks like Koyyagudem block-3, Sathupally block 3 for the power generation requirements of Telangana.Revanth Reddy said while it is the policy of the Centre to have one IIM in each state, but IIM has not been sanctioned to Telangana and urged to sanction the institute. “There is sufficient land available in the University of Hyderabad (UoH) and ready to provide alternate land also,” the CM said.Asking Narendra Modi to include Telangana in the India semiconductor mission, the CM said many companies are keen on establishing semiconductor firms in Hyderabad and are under consideration with the India semiconductor mission. On housing issues, Revanth asked the Centre to sanction 25 lakh houses under PM Awas Yojana in the next five years. Earlier Telangana got very less number of houses allocation as the state did not fit in the guidelines.Telangana CM asked for revival of ITIR project for Hyderabad, which was announced by the UPA govt at the Centre in 2010 for both Hyderabad and Bangalore. “The state govt earlier had identified land in three clusters in new IT companies and IT space developers,” the CM said.On the promises made to Telangana in the AP Reorganisation Act, the CM said instead of Integrated Rail Coach Factory promised at Kazipet, the Centre announced periodical overhauling workshop, but many other places got coach factories. He urged the PM to sanction a coach factory to Kazipet in the state and also a steel plant at Bayyaram. Similarly backward region grant fund (BGRF) to the state was released for only two years and has not been released for the past three years and is pending now to the tune of Rs 1,800 crore.He also asked for finalisation of tenders for the proposed regional ring road, developing national highways in place of state highways and sanction of 24 new Navodaya schools in every district.","Telangana Chief minister A Revanth Reddy urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to transfer 2,450 acres of defence land to Telangana govt.

As the monsoon season sets in, Delhi Zoo is taking innovative steps to ensure the health and safety of its animals by incorporating traditional ayurvedic methods.""The monsoon has entered the capital and we have to take all necessary measures to keep the animals healthy and safe during this season. We will use some Indian home remedies like neem oil, which will help protect the animals from common biting insects, including mosquitoes, biting midges and fleas,"" Delhi Zoo Director Sanjeet Kumar told PTI.Neem oil acts as an herbal disinfectant and fly repellent, said Kumar, turmeric, known for its anti-inflammatory and healing properties, will be used to treat itchy skin conditions, infections and wounds. Turmeric dust will be applied to lesions and foot sores to expedite healing, he said.Heavy rains often lead to waterlogging in certain parts of the zoo which create breeding grounds for mosquitoes. To counter this, quicklime (chuna) will be sprinkled in these areas to prevent mosquito proliferation.""We are using quicklime in waterlogged spots to stop the growth of mosquitoes and keep our animals safe,"" the official said.After the heavy rains that lashed the national capital on Friday, recording 228.1 mm of rainfall in just 24 hours - the highest in June since 1936 - the Delhi Zoo was also affected.A power failure occurred when floodwaters breached the zoo's boundary wall from the Sundernagar side, inundating the substation area and causing damage to the transformer.This incident affected animal enclosures, administrative offices and staff quarters. Referring to this situation, Kumar said that measures have been taken to prevent a recurrence.""The broken boundary is being repaired and barriers are being installed to prevent water backflow, ensuring water does not reach the animal enclosures,"" he said.Additional measures include providing elevated platforms in areas prone to water accumulation, ensuring animals have dry spots to rest.""The director also mentioned that we will purchase an additional generator dedicated to essential uses such as gate operation, Wi-Fi, control room, CCTV operations and animal enclosures for water pumping during rainy periods when electricity is cut off,"" said Kumar.The official also said that Delhi Zoo presently has two generators: one for the animal hospital and another for operational needs throughout the facility, with the third generator to be allocated accordingly.He emphasised the importance of preparing for rain-related health issues by stocking necessary medicines.The National Zoological Park, also known as Delhi Zoo, is situated in a 176-acre area under the central government's jurisdiction.","Neem oil acts as an herbal disinfectant and fly repellent.

NEW DELHI: A petition has been filed in the Supreme Court urging the Bihar government to conduct a structural audit of all existing and under-construction bridges in the state.The petition, submitted by advocate Brajesh Singh , highlights the urgent need for this audit following multiple bridge collapses in Bihar within just two years. The petition seeks to identify and either demolish or retrofit weak structures to prevent future incidents and protect public safety.Advocate Brajesh Singh raised the issue on Wednesday, emphasizing that three major under-construction bridges and several other bridges have collapsed recently in Bihar.He noted the severe consequences of these incidents, including fatalities and injuries, and underscored the potential for future collapses due to government negligence and corrupt practices.""It is a matter of grave concern that in a state like Bihar, which is the most flood-prone state of India, the total flood-affected area in the state is 68,800 sq. km which is 73.06 per cent of the total geographical area. Hence such routine accrual of the incident of falling bridges in Bihar is more disastrous as the lives of people at large are at stake. Therefore the urgent intervention of this Hon'ble Court is required to save the lives of people, as the under-construction bridges before its accomplishment collapsed routinely,"" the petitioner said.Singh also requested the Supreme Court to direct the Bihar Government to establish a real-time monitoring system for both old and new bridges, based on guidelines developed by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, Government of India. These guidelines, issued on March 4, 2024, mandate the use of sensors for real-time health monitoring of bridges, particularly those under National Highways and Centrally Sponsored Schemes, and should be applied to state-level bridges as well.""The petitioner has also sought to issue direction to respondents specifically Bihar for making an efficient permanent body through legislation or executive order, comprising high-level experts from the concerned field for continuous monitoring of all the existing and under-construction bridges in Bihar and also for maintaining the comprehensive database on the health of all existing bridges in the state,"" the petition stated.The Public Interest Litigation (PIL) enumerated various bridge collapses, primarily river bridges, in districts such as Araria, Siwan, Madhubani, and Kishanganj. Singh's petition underscores the critical need for immediate action to ensure the structural integrity of these infrastructures, which are vital for the state's connectivity and safety.The plea highlights that without thorough and proactive measures, further collapses could result in more tragic loss of life and property, especially in a state prone to heavy flooding. This call for action aims to mitigate such risks and safeguard the residents of Bihar from future bridge-related disasters.","A petition has been filed in the Supreme Court urging the Bihar government to conduct a structural audit of all existing and under-construction bridges.

BMRCL: Silk Board Double-Decker Flyover: Commuters Demand Immediate Opening,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/double-decker-flyover-awaits-vip-launch-commuters-irked/articleshow/111443589.cms,"BENGALURU: Commuters facing daily traffic woes at Silk Board junction have one demand: Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd ( BMRCL ) must open to motorists the lower deck of the rail-cum-road double-decker flyover between Ragigudda and Silk Board and three ramps at Silk Board junction without further delay.They argue that if the road infrastructure is ready, there should be no reason for delaying the opening, as formal inauguration by VIPs shouldn’t be a priority.Last year, BMRCL had to drop its plans to formally launch two stations of the Purple Line at Challaghatta and Benniganahalli after public outrage. The stations were operationalised and virtually inaugurated at a later stage.As part of Yellow Line Metro, BMRCL has built a 3km road-cum-rail flyover from Ragigudda to Silk Board. Initially, BMRCL planned to open the road infrastructure to vehicle users by the end of 2023, but the deadline was revised to May 2024 and then pushed to June. It is said the Metro authority is awaiting approval from the central and state govts, both partners in BMRCL, to set a formal opening date.While the lower deck was ready 1.5 years ago, construction of the ramps at Silk Board junction was finished recently. At present, the infrastructure is partially ready to accommodate traffic flow from Ragigudda and BTM Layout side to HSR Layout and Hosur Road. Work to ready the flyover to accommodate traffic flow in the opposite direction will take another year for completion.The alignment of the flyover passes through Jayadeva hospital junction, where the city’s tallest Metro station — providing interchange facilities for the upcoming Yellow and Pink lines — has been built. At Silk Board, BMRCL has built three ramps traversing over a flyover located at the junction. These ramps will allow motorists coming from Ragigudda and BTM Layout to reach HSR Layout (ORR side) and Electronics City (Hosur Road) without stopping at the signal.In 2016-17, BMRCL modified the design of the elevated Metro corridor to accommodate the city’s first double-decker flyover. The road infrastructure has cost Rs 449 crore.Those travelling from Jayanagar and Bannerghatta Road to Silk Board endured daily traffic snarls for years during the construction work. In 2019, BMRCL demolished the Jayadeva flyover to facilitate the work, and traffic diversions were put in place for years.Transport minister Ramalinga Reddy, who also represents BTM Layout assembly constituency, said, “As per the information I have, the road infrastructure is ready. BMRCL is waiting for consent from the ministry of housing and ministry of urban development for its formal inauguration. The road flyover and ramps at Silk Board will ease congestion on this busy corridor. Once the ramps from HSR Layout towards BTM Layout get ready, congestion will drastically come down at the junction.”BMRCL officials remained tight-lipped on the issue. A senior official simply stated, “The date of opening the road infrastructure will be communicated shortly.”","BMRCL has built a 3km road-cum-rail flyover from Ragigudda to Silk Board.

RBI warns banks of ‘credible threat intelligence’ regarding cyberattacks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/banks-put-on-alert-rbi-warns-banks-of-credible-threat-intelligence-regarding-cyberattacks/articleshow/111375796.cms,"Cyber Attack Threat: Combat Plan

Banks on alert! The Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) has cautioned banks across the nation to be vigilant against potential cyberattacks , following credible intelligence reports. Banks have been instructed to actively monitor their systems round the clock to detect any threats.In an advisory issued on June 24, the RBI said, ""In the light of credible threat intelligence received regarding potential cyberattacks, regulated entities are advised to put in place enhanced state of surveillance and resilience capabilities to guard against these threats.""According to an ET report, RBI's communication preceded a social media post suggesting that LulzSec , a group notorious for several high-profile attacks, was targeting Indian banks.The group, which was thought to have become inactive, is said to have resurfaced.Banks are required to continuously monitor network activities and server logs to identify any malicious intrusions. Additionally, they must keep a close watch on critical payment systems, including SWIFT (the messaging system for international fund transfers), card networks (facilitating card payments), and domestic real-time fund transfer frameworks such as RTGS, NEFT, and UPI.RBI has issued a reminder to banks, urging them to implement standard controls to safeguard against threats such as DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks. These attacks involve hackers launching a coordinated assault on a bank's systems, overwhelming them with a flood of queries that hinder the processing of legitimate customer requests and transactions on the website and online services.In addition to DDoS protection, banks are required to impose restrictions on remote logins and access to critical systems. They must also conduct thorough scans of all information systems to detect viruses and malware, and ensure that the latest patches are installed after necessary testing.Also Read | RBI’s overseas gold reserves drop to 6-year low!

The central bank has noted that cyberattacks tend to increase during times of political and economic instability, such as geopolitical tensions, leading to disruptive consequences.An industry official told the financial daily, “About a year ago, a similar communication was issued by the regulator and CERT-In (the Computer Emergency Response Team under the ministry of electronics). Typically, when there is some hint of a possible cyberattack, banks simultaneously test the efficacy of their continuity and contingency plans. It's the same this time”.The regulatory communication emphasizes the importance of banks having robust offline backup and recovery strategies in place, and testing their effectiveness.The official further stated, ""Given the numerous instances of attacks, some of which may go unreported, authorities and institutions can't take intelligence input lightly.""","The Reserve Bank of India has cautioned banks across the nation to be vigilant against potential cyberattacks.

Who is Keir Starmer? Labour Party's pick for UK's next PM,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/who-is-keir-starmer-labour-partys-pick-for-uks-next-pm/articleshow/111476826.cms,"Who is Keir Starmar?

As the voters turn up for the UK's general election, Labour Party 's pick, Keir Starmer is favoured by pollsters to emerge victorious in the upcoming election and assume the role of prime minister . Starmer is running against incumbent PM Rishi Sunak , who is trying hard to maintain the Conservative Party 's grip on power despite the electorate's weariness stemming from the party's 14-year tenure.Since taking over as leader from the left-leaning Jeremy Corbyn in April 2020, Starmer has been praised for steering his party towards the political centre and eradicating anti-Semitism within its ranks. His supporters view him as a pragmatic and reliable leader, well-equipped to guide Britain out of its economic downturn.However, his detractors argue that he lacks charisma and has been indecisive, failing to articulate a clear vision for the nation during a cautious campaign.Born in 1963 to a working-class family in Surrey, Starmer's upbringing was marked by the hardships his family encountered. His father, a toolmaker, had a distant relationship with him, while his mother, a nurse, struggled with a chronic illness. Starmer's unusual first name was chosen by his socialist parents as a tribute to Keir Hardie, the founding father of the Labour Party.Starmer's legal career spanned over three decades, during which he focused on human rights cases, advocating for prisoners facing the death penalty in the Caribbean and Africa. He also provided pro bono services to activists who criticized McDonald's environmental claims, further solidifying his reputation as a champion of justice. Starmer was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for his contributions to criminal justice, although he seldom uses the title ""Sir"" before his name.Starmer's entry into politics came relatively late, at the age of 52, when he was elected as a member of Parliament for Holborn and St Pancras in 2015. His reputation as a skilled lawyer paved the way for his political ascent, and he quickly rose through the ranks, serving as the shadow Brexit secretary under former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.Starmer's key policy promises reflect his pragmatic approach. In healthcare, he proposes to reduce NHS waiting lists by increasing weekly appointments, funded by tackling tax avoidance and closing loopholes.On immigration, he plans to establish a ""border security command"" to combat smuggling operations facilitating small boat crossings. In the housing sector, Starmer aims to boost first-time buyers by introducing a scheme that gives them priority access to new housing developments, while also promising to reform planning laws to deliver 1.5 million new homes.Education is another priority, with Starmer pledging to recruit 6,500 teachers and fund their salaries by ending tax breaks for private schools.","Keir Starmer is favoured by pollsters to emerge victorious in the upcoming election.

"Railways okays plan to double manufacture of non-AC train coaches to 10,000 in 2 years",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/railways-okays-plan-to-double-manufacture-of-non-ac-train-coaches-to-10000-in-2-years/articleshow/111494954.cms,"NEW DELHI: Indian Railways on Thursday approved the programme to double manufacturing of non-AC train coaches to around 10,000 in the next two years amid reports of long waiting list of tickets and criticism of crowding in unreserved and sleeper coaches of long-distance trains. Over 50% of these will be bogies with general seating facilities and more than one-third will be sleeper coaches.In the past two financial years, around 4,900 such non-AC coaches were manufactured.Currently, railways has around 55,000 non-AC coaches and with the new production, there will be an 18% growth by March 2026, enabling the national transporter to cater to the growing demand.As per the approved plan, 2,605 general coaches (GS) including for the newly introduced Amrit Bharat trains will be ready by March 2025. Similarly, 1,470 non-AC sleeper coaches including for Amrit Bharat trains will be manufactured this year. Amrit Bharat trains are fully non-AC rakes and will primarily ply on routes that have high demand of migrant workers. Currently, only two such trains are in operation.In 2025-26, the railways will produce 2,710 GS coaches and 1,910 non-AC sleeper bogies for both normal and Amrit Barat trains, sources said. They added these will cater to high demand of passengers on long routes.The approval for manufacturing GS and sleeper coaches for Amrit Bharat trains gains significance as the govt has planned to roll out around 50 such trains during the financial year and more in the next year. It is finalising the advanced features in Amrit Bharat trains before the mass production starts.Officials said more availability of non-AC coaches will enable railways to add such bogies in trains that have less than 24 coaches. To deal with the summer rush, the railways had added such coaches to regular trains to carry more passengers. “Some of these coaches will also be utilised in new trains that would be introduced,” said an official.“The demand for rail service is dynamic and decreases/ increases depending upon seasonal variations and growth of passenger traffic. The requirement of the coaches is based on these factors and has been included in the annual coach production programme. The production of coaches normally commensurate with the requirement,” an official said.","Indian Railways has around 55,000 non-AC coaches and with the new production, there will be an 18% growth by March 2026.

Impact on India-UK FTA negotiations

The snap election has diminished the prospects of the India-UK FTA being finalised by the current Tory government led by Rishi Sunak. The negotiations, which began in January 2022, were originally aimed at completing the deal by Diwali 2022.

However, the election has ""skewered any prospect of the finalisation of the long-awaited and much-anticipated FTA with India by a Conservative government,"" according to Rahul Roy-Chaudhury of the International Institute for Strategic Studies.

The Labour Party, widely expected to form the next government, has maintained its commitment to completing the FTA, though the timelines will remain uncertain for some time. Labour has maintained steadfast support for such a deal, subject to examining the ""fine print"" once in office.

Key sticking points in the FTA negotiations include India's demand for greater access for its skilled professionals in the UK market and the UK's push for lower import duties on goods like Scotch whisky and electric vehicles.

Immigration remains a contentious issue, with both major parties agreeing on the need to restrict it, which could be a sticking point for India's demand for temporary visas for its service sector workforce.

Labour has criticised the Conservatives for ""over-promising and under-delivering"" on the UK-India FTA and declared it is ""ready to go"" on finalising the deal if elected.

Shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said the FTA should be ""a floor not a ceiling"" for the partnership and aims to have it done by the end of 2024 if Labour wins the election.

Defence and security cooperation

The India-UK defence and security partnership is likely to continue strengthening, building on recent momentum from the 2+2 mechanism and defence minister Rajnath Singh's visit in early 2024 - the first such visit in 22 years.

Given the evolving strategic landscape of the Indo-Pacific region, the Sunak-led Conservative government had pivoted towards ""like-minded"" partners such as India to support a rules-based order. This has led to increasing India-UK strategic engagement in the Indo-Pacific, with both countries ramping up maritime presence through joint military exercises, enhanced naval interoperability, and collaboration in maritime domain awareness, counterterrorism and humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR) activities, said a repot by the Observer Research Foundation.

Labour plans to work with India to promote a ""free and open Indo-Pacific"" based on a rules-based order, in contrast to countries seeking to redraw borders by force, Shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said.

There may be some uncertainty around whether a Labour government would maintain the Indo-Pacific tilt initiated by the Conservatives.

While the Labour Party is expected to maintain the UK's support for Ukraine against Russia, there could be some shifts in the UK's approach to the Israel-Palestine conflict, with plans to stop arms sales to Israel.

Lammy has stated that ""the areas of cooperation and the areas for learning are limitless"" between the UK and India on cybersecurity.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: The 2024 UK general election results , expected to be declared by late morning of July 5 (IST), are expected to have minor impact on India-UK relations as both the Rishi Sunak-led Conservative (Tory) and Keir Rodney Starmer-led Labour parties have expressed support for strengthening ties with India.While there should be no major impact in the bilateral relationship regardless of the election outcome, the snap poll has diminished the prospects of the much-anticipated India-UK Free Trade Agreement (FTA) being finalised by the current Conservative government led by Sunak.The Labour Party , widely expected to form the next government, has maintained its commitment to completing the FTA, though the timelines will remain uncertain for some time. Starmer has said he is also committed to deepening cooperation with India in areas like technology, climate change, and education.India and the UK have completed 13 rounds of FTA negotiations to enhance their estimated £38.1 billion annual trading relationship.Political experts believe that if Labour comes to power -- as is widely expected -- then Starmer as PM will make UK-India economic partnership a priority in the Indo-Pacific, with the FTA as a foundation to expand cooperation in areas like climate, technology, and supply chains.","The snap election has diminished the prospects of the India-UK FTA being finalised by the current Tory government led by Rishi Sunak.

Ankur Jain , the former Chief Product Officer of BharatPe, ventured into the fields of AI and healthcare after leaving the fintech giant last year. Together with G V Sanjay Reddy, Chairman of Reddy Ventures, Jain co-founded Jivi.ai , marking his second entrepreneurial venture. Jain’s background in AI and machine learning has fueled the creation of a pioneering startup aimed at transforming primary healthcare on a global scale.Jivi.ai was established in January 2024 by Ankur Jain.Within a few months, the startup introduced its initial model, Jivi MedX, which surpassed well-known models such as Google’s Med-PaLM 2 and OpenAI’s GPT-4 on the Open Medical LLM Leaderboard. This achievement set a high benchmark for the company, signalling its potential to revolutionise the healthcare industry.Jivi MedX is just the beginning of a series of healthcare-focused models that the company plans to release. Jain disclosed plans for a ""model cluster,"" which includes specialised models for various medical fields such as diabetes and ophthalmology. The next model in line is a vision model, part of a multimodal MedX suite.Jain’s ambition with Jivi.ai is to develop an AI medical companion accessible to the entire global population, free of charge. While AI is making strides in areas like drug discovery and genomics, Jivi.ai focuses on primary healthcare, aiming to provide comprehensive support to both end users and medical professionals.Jivi.ai’s AI medical companion is designed to be more than just a chatbot. It will incorporate voice capabilities, allowing users to communicate with the model in their native languages. The goal is to support the top 25% of world languages, covering around 90% of the global population. Jain anticipates that voice capabilities will become mainstream within the next six months, enhancing the model's usability.Healthcare is one of the most regulated industries, and Jain is fully aware of the regulatory challenges that come with incorporating AI. Jivi.ai adheres to standards like ISO 42,001 and complies with evolving regulations both in India and globally. Jain believes that regulatory frameworks will ensure only serious players enter the market, ultimately benefiting consumers with high-quality products.Jivi MedX leverages the Llama 3 model, with parameters ranging from 8 billion to 70 billion. The startup initially tested existing models like Mistral and Llama 2, but none met the accuracy requirements for medical applications. After extensive experimentation, Jivi.ai settled on odds ratio preference optimization (ORPO), conducting around 150 experiments to achieve the desired accuracy. Currently, Jivi MedX boasts an average score of 91.65% across nine benchmark categories, with ongoing efforts to reach 95%.Despite being an AI startup, Jain’s first hire was a doctor. Nearly 40% of Jivi.ai’s 24-member team comprises medical professionals. This collaborative approach ensures that the models are rigorously evaluated and refined based on feedback from the medical community. Jain emphasised the importance of involving doctors from the outset to create a reliable and effective product.Jivi.ai trains its models using domain-specific data sourced from web scraping, medical journals, research papers, and clinical notes.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations. These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class. The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

The UK general election is set to bring about the first change in government in 14 years. According to the exit poll conducted on election night, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and his Conservative Party are likely to experience a crushing loss.As the votes are being tallied, early indications suggest that Labour has taken a commanding lead, potentially setting the stage for a change in the nation's political landscape.Credit rating agencies that downgraded the UK's rating after Brexit and the market turmoil caused by Liz Truss in 2022 have raised several concerns that require attention from the new government .One major issue is the UK's high debt-to-GDP ratio, which is close to 100%. While all parties have pledged to improve public services and invest in infrastructure without increasing key taxes, the market reaction to Truss's spending plans serves as a cautionary tale against radical measures. S&P Global highlighted the importance of balancing revenue and expenditure adjustments to improve the underlying fiscal position.Another concern is the UK's sluggish economic growth, averaging just 1.6% annually over the past decade. Fitch Ratings, which raised its outlook on the UK's AA- rating to ""stable"" in March, notes that the country's debt-to-GDP ratio is more than double the median for 'AA' bracket countries. Boosting growth will be challenging due to factors such as net migration, labour market participation, and productivity growth issues.The new government will also need to consider whether to modify the UK's self-imposed fiscal rules, which mandate a reduction in public sector debt as a share of GDP over a five-year period. While some Labour officials have suggested that significant reforms are currently off the table, the government faces substantial debt issuance and interest payments in the coming years.Scope, a European-based rating firm, highlights the importance of maintaining the pound's status as a global reserve currency. ""A stable government managing credible budgetary policies"" and ""enhancing access to the (EU) Single Market"" are seen as key factors in preserving this status.Finally, the issue of raw sewage discharge by privatised water companies has become a prominent election topic. If these companies fail to invest in solving the problem, the government may need to intervene and run them, adding to the UK's debt burden. While this alone may not be enough to change the UK's rating, it could contribute to a confluence of factors that could impact the country's credit assessment.","The UK general election is set to bring about the first change in government in 14 years.

Nathan'S Hotdog Eating Contest: Nathan's Hotdog Eating Contest winner is Miki Sudo with 51 dogs in 10 minutes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nathans-hotdog-eating-contest-winner-is-miki-sudo-with-51-dogs-in-10-minutes/articleshow/111494307.cms,"Defending champion Miki Sudo retained the women's title at the annual Nathan's Hot Dog Eating contest Thursday with a record-breaking 51 dogs in a 10 minutes. Mayoi Ebihara, of Tokyo, Japan, came in second with 37 dogs, while Arizona’s Michelle Lesco finished third with 23.5 wieners.Sudo, a Florida native, beat her beef-eating competitors by a mile at the July 4 tradition.Her 28-year-old rival, Mayoi Ebihara, of Japan, came in second with 37 dogs, while Arizona’s Michelle Lesco, 40, finished third with 23.5 wieners.Miki Sudo has been the reigning queen since 2014 except in 2021 when she took a break for pregnancy. Last year, she managed a winning 39-and-a-half hot dogs in 10 minutes.Sudo’s previous personal best came in 2020 when she chowed down on a whopping 48.5 dogs in the beef-eating competition.With the event's biggest star —- Joey “Jaws” Chestnut — out of the contest this year, Sudo’s result set up a possible scenario in which the women’s champ out-eats the men’s winner. Geoffrey Esper, who came second last year, also has a personal best of 51, but only ate 49 last year.Chestnut, who won 16 out of the previous 17 contests, isn't attending the competition over a sponsorship tiff. Instead, he'll compete against soldiers at a U.S. Army base in El Paso later in the day. That leaves the traditional Brooklyn event wide open for a new winner in the men's division, with eaters from around the world competing on America's Independence Day to see how many hot dogs they can eat in 10 minutes.Thousands of fans flock each year to the event held outside the original Nathan’s location in Brooklyn's Coney Island, a beachfront destination with amusement parks and a carnivalesque summer culture. ESPN is broadcasting the contest live. The men’s will begin at approximately 12:20 p.m.Competitors are coming from over a dozen states and five continents, with prospects from Brazil, Japan, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Australia and the Czech Republic vying for the coveted title and $10,000 prize money.“There's going to be a new champion,” Australian James Webb, who holds a world record for eating 70 doughnuts in eight minutes, said at a preview event in New York on Wednesday.Last year Chestnut, of Indiana, chewed his way to the title by downing 62 dogs and buns in 10 minutes. The record, which he set in 2021, is 76.“I'm going to be pushing myself,” Sudo said Wednesday. Her rival Mayoi Ebihara, from Japan, said through a translator that she would eat until she passes out, with a goal of downing 50 hot dogs.Chestnut was initially disinvited from the event over a sponsorship deal with Impossible Foods, a company that specializes in plant-based meat substitutes.Major League Eating, which organizes the Nathan’s Famous contest, has since said it walked back the ban, but Chestnut decided to spend the holiday with the troops anyway.Chestnut said he wouldn’t return to the Coney Island contest without an apology.(With agency inputs)","Miki Sudo, a Florida native, beat her beef-eating competitors by a mile at the July 4 tradition.

Ra'Ad: Pakistan Arms JF-17 Jets with Ra'ad-I Nuclear Missiles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-arming-jf-17-jets-with-raad-nuke-missiles/articleshow/111454243.cms,"A recent image captured during rehearsals for the 2023 Pakistan Day Parade has shed light on the potential nuclear capabilities of Pakistan's JF-17 Thunder Block II aircraft. The photograph depicts a JF-17 carrying what appears to be a Ra'ad air-launched cruise missile (ALCM), marking the first public observation of this configuration.Analyzing images of a JF-17 Thunder Block II from the 2023 Pakistan Day Parade rehearsals, the Federation of American Scientists (FAS) confirmed that the fighter jet was equipped with a Ra'ad-I nuclear missile.""Notably, this was the first time such a configuration had been observed in public,"" the FAS said in its report.To determine the specific type of Ra'ad missile in the image, comparisons were made with Ra'ad-I and Ra'ad-II missiles displayed in previous Pakistan Day Parades. While the Ra'ad-II, first unveiled in 2017, was presented as having nearly double the range capability of the Ra'ad-I, external features did not clearly distinguish the two versions until 2022. The latest Ra'ad-II, displayed in 2022 and 2024, features a distinct 'x-shaped' tail fin configuration, while the missile photographed on the JF-17 more closely resembles the 'twin-tail' configuration of the Ra'ad-I, the FAS report said.Using Photoshop's Vanishing Point feature and reference measurements from the vehicles carrying the missiles, the lengths of the Ra'ad-I and Ra'ad-II were estimated to be around 4.9 meters each. The missile on the JF-17 was also measured using the aircraft's length as a reference, resulting in a similar 4.9-meter estimate. These measurements, along with the tail fin configuration, suggest that the missile observed on the JF-17 is likely the Ra'ad-I ALCM rather than the newer Ra'ad-II or the conventional anti-ship variant, Taimoor, the FAS report by Eliana Johns said.The image provides evidence that Pakistan has made significant progress in equipping its JF-17s with the capability to supplement or replace the nuclear strike role of the ageing Mirage III/Vs. However, questions remain about the deployment status of the Ra'ad systems and whether Pakistan will continue to retain a nuclear gravity bomb capability or transition to stand-off cruise missiles exclusively.These developments occur amidst an ongoing nuclear arms competition in the region, with Pakistan, India, and China pursuing advanced technologies such as multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles (MIRVs). The heightened tensions and the development of short-range, lower-yield nuclear-capable systems by Pakistan have raised concerns about accelerated arms racing and escalation risks in a potential conflict between India and Pakistan.",A recent image captured during rehearsals for the 2023 Pakistan Day Parade has shed light on the potential nuclear capabilities of Pakistan's JF-17 Thunder Block II aircraft.

"Pakistan imposed a milk tax, now dairy staple costs more in Karachi than Paris",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-imposed-a-milk-tax-now-dairy-staple-costs-more-in-karachi-than-paris/articleshow/111485554.cms,"Milk prices in Pakistan surged by more than a fifth after a new tax was applied, making the dairy staple more expensive than in France, Australia and some other developed nations.Ultra-high temperature, or UHT, milk now costs 370 rupees ($1.33) a liter in supermarkets in Karachi. That compares with $1.29 in Amsterdam, $1.23 in Paris, and $1.08 in Melbourne, according to data collected by Bloomberg.An 18% tax was applied to packaged milk as part of taxation changes approved in the national budget last week. Previously, it was tax-exempt.Before the impost, which resulted in retail prices increasing by as much as 25%, milk costs were comparable with developing countries such as Vietnam and Nigeria, said Muhammad Nasir, a spokesman for the local unit of Dutch dairy producer Royal FrieslandCampina NV.Costlier milk will add to rising inflation in the South Asian country, where wages have stagnated, eroding spending power. The increase may also worsen child health. About 40% of the nation lives in poverty.“It will deny nutrition from a population that is already suffering from malnutrition,” Nasir said in a text message. About 60% of Pakistani children under 5 years suffer anemia and 40% suffer from stunting.Pakistan raised taxes by 40%, the highest on record, in last week’s budget aimed at meeting conditions set by the International Monetary Fund for a new bailout.","Ultra-high temperature, or UHT, milk now costs 370 rupees ($1.33) a liter in supermarkets in Karachi.
