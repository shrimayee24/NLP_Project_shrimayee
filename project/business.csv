"With two more Ramsar sites, India joins China at number 3",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/with-two-more-ramsar-sites-india-joins-china-at-number-3/articleshow/110781202.cms,"NEW DELHI: India has added Bihar's two bird sanctuaries in the country's list of wetlands of international importance under Ramsar convention, becoming a joint third with China in terms of having 82 such sites in the global list. Currently, the highest number of such sites is in the UK (175) followed by Mexico (144).The number of Indian sites in the list has increased from 26 to 82 in the last ten years, of which 40 have been added in the last three years. The latest two - Nagi and Nakti bird sanctuaries - were added on the occasion of the World Environment Day on Wednesday. Both are man-made reservoirs situated in the Jhajha forest range of Jamui district in Bihar.The wetlands are land areas covered by water, either temporarily/ seasonally or permanently. Such areas play a key role in hydrological cycle and flood control, water supply and providing food, fibre and raw materials.The Convention was adopted in 1971 in the Iranian city of Ramsar. It provides a framework for the conservation and wise use of wetlands and their resources across its 172-member countries including India.According to details submitted by India, Nakti bird sanctuary was developed primarily for irrigation through the construction of Nakti dam. In 1984, the wetland was designated as a bird sanctuary, highlighting its importance as a wintering habitat for several migratory species, with over 20,000 birds congregating during winter months. This includes one of the largest congregations of red-crested pochard in the Indo-Gangetic plain.Nagi bird sanctuary was, on the other hand, created following the damming of the Nagi river, which enabled the gradual formation of water bodies with clear water and aquatic vegetation. Overall, the wetland and its fringes provide habitat for over 75 bird species, 33 fish, and 12 aquatic plants. Notably, the site hosts one of the largest congregations of bar-headed geese in the Indo-Gangetic plain.","India has added Bihar's two bird sanctuaries in the country's list of wetlands of international importance under Ramsar convention.

"Rahul alleges Rs 30 lakh crore stocks ‘scam’; baseless, says Goyal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rahul-alleges-rs-30-lakh-crore-stocks-scam-baseless-says-goyal/articleshow/110778334.cms,"Rs 30 lakh crore Rahul mentioned is notional amount, not tied to trading: Goyal

NEW DELHI: Congress and BJP were involved in a high-wattage face-off on Thursday with Rahul Gandhi demanding a Joint Parliamentary Committee probe into the “role” of PM Narendra Modi , home minister Amit Shah and finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman into what he claimed was a “Rs 30 lakh crore stock market scam” allegedly engineered through “fake” exit polls . BJP’s Piyush Goyal hit back by alleging that the charge was a conspiracy to mislead investors .Addressing a press conference, Rahul said the PM, home minister and FM gave “investment advice” to people ahead of poll results and added that the “fake” pollsters also needed to be investigated.BJP dismissed the charges and accused Rahul of conspiring to scare domestic and foreign investors, asserting that stock market indices had begun rising as a Modi-led govt was set to return to office for a third consecutive term. “Rahul Gandhi has still not overcome the loss in the Lok Sabha polls. Now, he is conspiring to mislead market investors ,” Goyal said at a press conference while rejecting the demand for a JPC probe.EAS Sarma, a former secretary in the finance ministry, has written to economic affairs secretary Ajay Seth demanding a probe by the Enforcement Directorate, CBI and CBDT into the stock market crash. He has also asked whether Sebi has taken up any investigation into the issue.Buoyed by exit poll predictions of a decisive mandate for BJP-led NDA, the week kicked off with the BSE sensex soaring 2,500 points to a record high of 76,469 only to register its worst crash of 4,390 points to 72,079 after the poll results on Tuesday, resulting in a Rs 31 lakh crore wealth destruction for investors. At one point, it was down 6,000 points on heavy selling of shares. It has, however, recovered since then and on Thursday, closed 692 points higher at 75,074. Rahul questioned why the BJP leadership had encouraged people to invest in stocks ahead of poll results and alleged that Modi and Shah were “directly involved” in what he described as the “biggest stock market scam”.“Why did the PM and HM give specific investment advice to the 5 crore families investing in the stock markets?” he asked. “Why both the interviews were given to the same media house (owned) by the same business group, which is also under SEBI investigations for manipulating stock markets? What is the connection between BJP, fake exit pollsters and dubious foreign investors who invested one day before the exit polls were announced and made huge profits at the cost of five crore families?”Without naming NDTV, Rahul said the interviews (of PM Modi and Amit Shah) were conducted by channels owned by Adani.“This is a criminal act,” he said, arguing that it was the first time that Modi, Shah and Sitharaman had commented on the stock market. “Quite interestingly, this has never happened before that the PM has commented on the stock market. This is happening for the first time and multiple times when he is saying that the stock market is going to boom,” Rahul said. He claimed that from its internal surveys and feedback from intelligence agencies, BJP knew it was not going to win over 220 seats, but despite that “the exit polls were made to show that BJP was winning a large number of seats”.Countering the charges, Piyush Goyal said the Rs 30 lakh crore mentioned Rahul was a notional amount and did not relate to trading. “He (Rahul) does not understand. That is why people of India do not trust him,” the newly elected MP from Mumbai said, arguing that retail and domestic investors had benefited the most from the stock market rise during the last 10 years.“Rahul should be concerned about the fear of investors as the market crashed when Congress was doing better than expected. Now, people are confident that the Modi govt is coming back, and the market has stabilised and is reclaiming its previous highs,” he said.He expressed confidence that the reforms envisioned by the new govt will continue at a time when the country is poised for a bright future. “We are delighted that our allies are progressive and support reforms,” Goyal said.He said Rahul was desperate after the opposition alliance failed in its bid for power.","Rahul Gandhi demands a Joint Parliamentary Committee probe into the “role’ of PM Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah and finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman.

China lodges protest against PM’s reply to Taiwan’s wish,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/china-lodges-protest-against-pms-reply-to-taiwans-wish/articleshow/110777132.cms,"NEW DELHI: China Thursday lodged a protest with India for PM Modi ’s acknowledgement of Taiwan Prez Lai Ching-te congratulatory message on X in which Modi had said he’s looking forward to closer ties as “we work towards mutually beneficial economic and technological partnership”. Chinese foreign ministry urged India to resist Taiwan’s “political calculations'” and not do anything to violate the “one-China principle”.Lai had said in his message he wanted to enhance the partnership and expand collaboration on trade, technology and other sectors to contribute to peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific. China, which opposes any political contact between Taiwan and countries with which Beijing has diplomatic relations, said it had protested with Indian authorities and that India is familiar with China’s “clear” position on the issue.“The one-China principle is a universally recognised norm in international relations and a prevailing consensus in the international community. India has made serious political commitments on this and is supposed to recognise, be alarmed about and resist the Taiwan authorities’ political calculations. China has protested to India about this,” said foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning.China too has congratulated Modi for the poll outcome but not in the form of a message from President Xi Jinping but through an official statement, and through its newly appointed ambassador Xu Feihong. Like other countries which have diplomatic ties with China, India too follows one-China policy even though there has been no public articulation of it since 2010. China opposes all forms of official interactions between Taiwan authorities and other countries, saying Taiwan is an inalienable part of the Chinese territory.",China lodged a protest with India for PM Modi ’s acknowledgement of Taiwan Prez Lai Ching-te congratulatory message on X.

Ties anchored to rule of law: Trudeau to Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ties-anchored-to-rule-of-law-trudeau-to-modi/articleshow/110777121.cms,"NEW DELHI: Canadian PM Justin Trudeau congratulated his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi for the majority to NDA alliance in Lok Sabha elections, while telling him that bilateral ties are anchored, among other things, in the rule of law . Canada has repeatedly cited the same in the past nine months to claim involvement of Indian agents in the killing of Khalistan separatist and Canadian national Hardeep Singh Nijjar last year in the Vancouver area.The allegation led to a major diplomatic flare-up that resulted in the expulsion by India of 41 Canadian diplomats who, Indian authorities claimed, were interfering in India’s internal affairs. “Congratulations to Indian PM Narendra Modi on his electoral victory. Canada stands ready to work with his govt to advance the relationship between our nations’ peoples—anchored to human rights, diversity, and the rule of law,’’ said Trudeau .While acknowledging the importance of ties with India, and its role in the Indo-Pacific, Canada has maintained that its immediate priority with India is to fix accountability for the Nijjar killing. Canada has arrested four men in the case so far but India maintains Ottawa hasn’t shared any information or evidence that Indian agencies could probe.There were signs earlier this week of further deterioration in ties as a Canadian security and intelligence report tabled in Parliament alleged India is the second biggest threat to democracy after China. The report claimed India is interfering in Canadian democratic processes and institutions, including “through the targeting of Canadian politicians, ethnic media and Indo-Canadian ethnocultural communities.”According to CBC News, the report says that while India’s foreign interference efforts are not as widespread as those of China, they are “of significant concern.”“India seeks to cultivate relationships with a variety of witting and unwitting individuals across Canadian society with the intent of inappropriately exerting India’s influence across all orders of govt, particularly to stifle or discredit criticism of the Govt ,” says the report.",Canadian PM Justin Trudeau congratulated his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi for the majority to NDA alliance in Lok Sabha elections.

67 students scoring a perfect 720 in NEET-UG 2024 raises doubts; six have seat numbers from same sequence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/67-students-scoring-a-perfect-720-in-neet-ug-2024-raises-doubts-six-have-seat-numbers-from-same-sequence/articleshow/110752235.cms,"MUMBAI: The NEET-UG 2024 results, announced on Tuesday, have taken several students by surprise. A day after, students and parents have raised objections over an unprecedented numbers of students, 67, bagging the perfect score - 720 out of 720 - also other discrepancies in the statement issued by the agency.Of the total students bagging full marks, six have seat numbers from the same sequence and are from Haryana, indicating the chance of them being from a same centre.Parents, in letters to the National Testing Agency ( NTA ), are seeking a thorough investigation into the alleged discrepancies in the results before the counselling commences.Scorecards of students scoring 718 and 719 are also being circulated on social media, which parents claim is impossible to achieve in the paper, when each NEET question carries four marks and one mark each is given for negative marking.The NTA, in a statement, said that they received few representations and court cases from NEET candidates raising concerns of loss of time during the exam held on May 5.""Such cases/representations were considered by NTA and the normalisation formula, which has been devised and adopted by the apex court in a judgement from 2018, to address the loss of time faced by candidates. The loss of time was ascertained and such candidates were compensated with grace marks. So their marks can be 718 or 719 too,"" said the statement.Parent representative Ruiee Kapoor said that the explanation provided by the NTA is not satisfactory as a score of 718 or 719 is technically improbable. ""Also 67 students scoring full marks is unprecedented in NEET-UG and highly unusual. There is also bunching of students with higher marks, which has led to a major discrepancy in the marks and their corresponding marks. At the same scores, the corresponding ranks have gone up by three to four times. While the overall cut-off has also risen from 137 to 164, students even with 720 marks will find it difficult to get a seat in AIIMS Delhi-a sought-after institute,"" said Kapoor, adding that MBBS admissions closed at rank 57 in the open merit last year in the institute.An NTA official said that more students scored higher marks due to the normalisation process and also because the physics and chemistry sections were relatively easier and as per NCERT books. This was done to address equity and also to discourage coaching mafia, said the official.Another parent claimed that the provision of grace marks due to waste of time should have been specified in the information brochure, as students could have utilised it in the past. Sachin Bangad, a parent representative, said, the exam was ""managed"".""How is that six students who scored full 720 marks are from the same exam centre in Faridabad, Haryana,"" he asked. A senior NTA official reasoned this to the fact that in this particular exam centre in Haryana, ""there was incorrect distribution of papers and they lost 45 minutes. When it was corrected, a formula as per previous court order was used in a few cities including this.""Experts including faculty doctors have demanded an explanation of the normalization criteria of NEET results at how many centers was the normalization applied. Parents said the significantly high cut-off have put off many candidates who were aspiring for joining government medical colleges.""Students scoring less than 660 marks now have a very poor chance of securing admission to government medical colleges,"" said Bangad. This is in contrast to the previous year, where students with 600 marks were able to secure seats in government colleges.","Parents are seeking a thorough investigation into the alleged discrepancies in the results.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) is set to form the NDA government at the Centre for a third consecutive term, with Narendra Modi poised to take oath as prime minister once again.The newly elected Members of Parliament (MPs) from the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) are expected to meet on Friday to formally elect Modi as their leader. The swearing-in ceremony is likely to take place on Sunday.It is also expected that all NDA constituents will submit letters of support for Modi as the new prime minister to the President on Friday.Meanwhile, the guest list for the swearing-in ceremony is primarily guided by India's 'Neighbourhood First Policy' and its strategic focus on island nations considered important in the Indian Ocean region. Top leaders from Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Bhutan, Nepal, Mauritius, and Seychelles are likely to attend the ceremony.As the NDA prepares to form the government, discussions are ongoing among alliance partners regarding their share of ministerial berths and the selection of probables from within their respective parties. The BJP is in touch with its allies to address various issues and concerns.The JD(U), with 12 MPs, is the second-largest BJP ally after the TDP, which has 16 parliamentarians. The support of these two parties is crucial for the BJP to form a stable government at the Centre.Meanwhile, the opposition INDIA bloc, which includes the Congress, has secured 234 seats in the Lok Sabha. NCP (SP) leader Supriya Sule mentioned that the INDIA bloc had decided to adopt a ""wait and watch"" approach regarding government formation at the Centre but added that the alliance was prepared if the opportunity arose.As the political landscape unfolds, the NDA is set to form the government with the support of its allies, while the opposition INDIA bloc remains vigilant and ready to explore any potential opportunities that may emerge.The newly elected MPs of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance are set to convene on Friday to choose Narendra Modi as their leader, setting the stage for his third term as prime minister. The swearing-in ceremony is expected to take place on Sunday.Following Modi's selection as the NDA MPs' leader, prominent alliance members such as N Chandrababu Naidu of the TDP and Nitish Kumar of the JD(U) will accompany the prime minister to meet President Droupadi Murmu and present her with the list of parliamentarians backing him, according to some alliance members.The NDA has secured 293 seats in the 543-member Lok Sabha, comfortably surpassing the majority mark of 272.The Telugu Desam Party (TDP), the second-largest constituent in the BJP-led NDA with 16 MPs, is expected to join the union cabinet, according to a party spokesperson. The TDP's participation in the central government is not unprecedented, as the party has been part of NDA governments in the past, including during Atal Bihari Vajpayee's tenure as prime minister.TDP supremo N Chandrababu Naidu is set to be sworn in as the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh on June 12. Naidu has instructed all party MPs to attend the NDA's meeting in New Delhi on Friday, and he is also traveling to the national capital.The TDP and its allies, the BJP and Janasena, collectively won 21 out of the 25 MP seats in Andhra Pradesh. Senior BJP leader and Rajya Sabha MP GVL Narasimha Rao stated that discussions are ongoing among NDA partners regarding cabinet positions, but no official information has been released yet.During the previous NDA regime from 2014 to 2018, the TDP was allocated one cabinet minister post and a minister of state position, which were held by P Ashok Gajapathi Raju and Y S Chowdary (now in BJP), respectively.The Janata Dal (United), a key ally of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has reiterated its demand for granting special category status (SCS) to Bihar. With the BJP relying on its allies to form the government at the Centre, the JD(U)'s demand has gained renewed attention.The party, led by Bihar CM Nitish Kumar, has been pushing for SCS for the state since 2011-12, and the Bihar cabinet had even passed a resolution last year requesting the Centre to grant the status.The Centre had previously stated that it would not entertain demands for SCS from any state, following the 14th Finance Commission's recommendation to abolish it.The SCS was introduced in 1969 to benefit certain backward states with hilly terrains, strategic international borders, and economic and infrastructural backwardness. However, the JD(U) remains firm on its demand, with senior party leader and Bihar minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary stating, ""The JD(U) is part of the NDA and will remain with it. But there are certain demands of the JD(U) related to the financial condition and economy of Bihar that must be fulfilled by the Centre. Our demand for special category status for Bihar is fully justified and needs to be fulfilled. We stick to our demand for SCS for Bihar.""JD(U), a key ally of the BJP in NDA, is expected to demand up to three cabinet positions in the upcoming BJP-led government at the Centre. With 12 Members of Parliament (MPs), the JD(U) is the second-largest BJP ally in the NDA after the Telugu Desam Party (TDP), which has 16 MPs. The support of these allies is vital for the BJP to form the government, as it fell short of the majority mark in the recent Lok Sabha elections.A senior JD(U) leader expressed the party's aspiration for a ""respectable"" representation in the Union Council of Ministers. Shrawan Kumar, a JD(U) leader and Bihar Rural Development Minister, stated, ""Prime Minister Narendra Modi and our party chief Nitish Kumar ji will decide the matter of cabinet berths. But, it should be respectable."" He also emphasized the importance of considering the 2025 Bihar assembly polls when deciding on the allocation of ministerial positions.According to JD(U) sources, the party is particularly interested in portfolios such as railways, rural development, agriculture, water resources, and heavy industries. Some of the frontrunners for ministerial positions within the party include Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Jha, Rajiv Ranjan Singh 'Lalan', Kaushalendra Kumar, Ramprit Mandal, and Lovely Anand.K C Tyagi, a JD(U) leader, stated that the party has called for a review of the Agnipath scheme and will continue to pursue the issue of caste census. He also clarified that the party's support for the BJP is unconditional, although they hope for Bihar to be granted special status to address the challenges faced by the state after its bifurcation.In the 543-member Lok Sabha, the BJP secured 240 seats, falling 32 seats short of an absolute majority. However, the NDA collectively won 293 seats, ensuring their ability to form the government.Maharashtra NCP president Jayant Patil has dismissed speculations about Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray joining the ruling BJP-led NDA. Patil, along with NCP (SP) president Sharad Pawar, affirmed Thackeray's commitment to the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance following the recent Lok Sabha elections, where Shiv Sena (UBT) and BJP each won nine seats in Maharashtra.The opposition bloc, consisting of Shiv Sena (UBT), NCP, and Congress, secured 30 out of 48 seats in the state. Patil assured that Thackeray is focused on forming an MVA government in the upcoming state assembly polls in October.""There is no chance that he will switch sides,"" Patil said when asked about speculation that started after Thackeray skipped a key INDIA bloc meeting held in New Delhi on Wednesday and reports in a section of the media about backchannel moves for a rapprochement with the BJP-led grouping.Chirag Paswan, the leader of the LJP (Ram Vilas) party, announced that his party has offered its unwavering support to PM Modi following the BJP-led NDA's triumph in the recent Lok Sabha elections. Paswan attributed the victory to PM Modi's leadership and emphasized that their support comes without any conditions attached.Paswan said, ""We extended our support to the prime minister and his leadership at yesterday's meeting. We humbly accepted his leadership without any condition.""He further emphasized, ""And there can't be any condition. This is the victory of the prime minister's leadership. The NDA has got a landslide victory because of the way he took the NDA along with him.""Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar and two Election Commissioners, Gyanesh Kumar and Sukhbir Singh Sandhu, met with President Droupadi Murmu at the Rashtrapati Bhavan. During the meeting, they presented the President with a copy of the notification issued by the Election Commission of India, as required by Section 73 of the Representation of People's Act, 1951. The notification contained the names of the newly elected members to the 18th Lok Sabha following the recent general elections.President Murmu congratulated the CEC and the Election Commissioners on the successful completion of the electoral process, which is considered the largest democratic exercise in human history. She expressed her appreciation for the efforts of the Election Commission, its officials, staff members, and other public officials involved in managing and overseeing the campaign and polling process. The President also commended the police and security personnel, both at the Central and State levels, for their tireless and diligent work in upholding the sanctity of the people's ballot and ensuring a free and fair election.Furthermore, President Murmu praised the hundreds of millions of voters who participated in the election process in such large numbers, noting that this was entirely in keeping with India's Constitution and its deep-rooted democratic traditions.According to reliable sources, top leaders from Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, Bhutan, Nepal, Mauritius, and Seychelles are expected to be present at Prime Minister Narendra Modi's swearing-in ceremony in the coming weekend. Invitations have reportedly been sent to Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe, and other leaders from the selected countries.Among the leaders being invited are Nepalese Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda', Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu, Bhutanese Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay, Mauritian Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth, and Seychellois President Wavel Ramkalawan. Modi is set to assume the role of prime minister for an unprecedented third consecutive term, with the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) securing 293 seats in the Lok Sabha elections.The selection of foreign leaders for the ceremony was primarily guided by India's ""Neighbourhood First Policy"" and its strategic emphasis on island nations deemed significant in the Indian Ocean region. Modi is expected to take the oath of office on June 9.The Bihar BJP president, Samrat Chaudhary, announced that the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) would contest the upcoming 2025 assembly elections in the state under the leadership of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar.In the recent Lok Sabha elections, Nitish Kumar's Janata Dal (United) contested 16 seats and won 12. The party is in coalition with the BJP, Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), and Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM) in Bihar.Kumar's support has become crucial for the NDA government formation at the Centre, as the BJP failed to secure a majority in the Lok Sabha on its own.Given the current political situation in the country, Samrat Chaudhary's statement about the NDA contesting the 2025 assembly polls under Kumar's leadership holds significant importance.""The NDA will contest the next assembly elections in Bihar under the CM's leadership... we have started preparations for it,"" Chaudhary, who is also the deputy chief minister, told reporters.The Congress party has scheduled a meeting of its working committee on June 8 to analyze the results of the recently concluded Lok Sabha election and deliberate on the party's future strategy. The meeting, chaired by Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, will commence at 11 am at the party headquarters.In the Lok Sabha election, the counting of votes took place on June 4. The Congress has secured the position of the second largest party, significantly improving its tally from 52 in the 2019 election to 99 seats in the current one. This achievement will enable the party to claim the Leader of Opposition's post in the Lok Sabha after a decade, a position it failed to secure in both 2014 and 2019 due to insufficient representation.There is a growing demand within the party for former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi to assume the role of the party and opposition leader in the Lok Sabha. This matter is expected to be discussed during the Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting, which is the party's apex decision-making body. Senior Congress leaders, including Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, along with other prominent figures, will participate in the deliberations.With its strengthened presence in Parliament, the Congress aims to hold the government accountable on issues affecting the common people, such as rising prices and unemployment, in both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha.The stock markets continued their upward trend for the second consecutive day, with the benchmark Sensex surging nearly 693 points. The rally was driven by easing political concerns as the ruling NDA initiated efforts to form the new government.The 30-share BSE Sensex reclaimed the 75,000 mark, closing at a more than week high of 75,074.51, up 692.27 points or 0.93 per cent. During intraday trading, the index soared 915.49 points or 1.23 per cent to reach 75,297.73. Similarly, the NSE Nifty gained 201.05 points or 0.89 per cent to settle at 22,821.40, with 38 of its constituents ending in the green. The index rallied 289.8 points or 1.28 per cent to touch an intraday high of 22,910.15.The key indices, Sensex and Nifty, had experienced a sharp decline of nearly 6 per cent on Tuesday following below-expectation results in the Lok Sabha polls. The market meltdown led to investors losing a record Rs 31 lakh crore in a single day. However, the indices recovered more than 3 per cent on Wednesday as NDA allies pledged their support to the BJP in forming the new government. Over the course of two days of gains, investor wealth has recovered by approximately Rs 21 lakh crore.In a press conference, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi made serious allegations against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah, accusing them of direct involvement in what he termed as the ""biggest stock market scam."" Gandhi claimed that retail investors suffered losses amounting to Rs 30 lakh crore following the poll results and demanded a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) probe into the matter.According to Gandhi, Modi and Shah were aware of the BJP's actual seat count, but they artificially inflated stock prices with the help of ""fake"" exit polls. He alleged that when the results were announced on June 4, the markets crashed, resulting in substantial losses for retail investors. The former Congress chief called for an investigation into the alleged roles of the prime minister, home minister, and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in this ""scam,"" claiming that they had advised retail investors to purchase stocks before the results, which he deemed ""unprecedented.""Gandhi further alleged that the exit polls were conducted by channels ""owned by Adani"" and questioned the need for the PM and home minister to provide investment advice, which people took seriously and subsequently suffered significant losses.KC Tyagi, a leader of the Janata Dal (United), an ally of the BJP, stated on Thursday that his party has called for a review of the Agnipath scheme and will continue to pursue the issue of caste census, which he emphasized as a necessity in the current times. He also clarified that his party's support for the BJP was ""unconditional"".Tyagi expressed, ""There is anger among voters on the (short-term army recruitment) Agniveer scheme. Our party wants those shortcomings to be removed, on which people have objections.""Regarding the Uniform Civil Code (UCC), Tyagi mentioned that the JD(U) is not against it, but he stressed the importance of consulting all stakeholders. He said, ""On the UCC, the chief minister (Nitish Kumar) had written to the Law Commission. We are not against the UCC. But there should be consultation with all the stakeholders, chief ministers, political parties and different sects, and a resolution should be found.""","The newly elected MPs of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance are set to convene on Friday to choose Narendra Modi as their leader.

Tribunal quashes attachment of multiple Mumbai flats of Praful in laundering case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tribunal-quashes-attachment-of-multiple-mumbai-flats-of-praful-in-laundering-case/articleshow/110776703.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a major relief to NCP leader Praful Patel , the Appellate Tribunal for Safema, dealing with cases under Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), by an order of June 3 quashed the attachment of multiple flats owned by him on the 12th to 15th floors of Ceejay House in Worli, Mumbai, worth over Rs 180 crore.ED had attached at least seven flats in Ceejay House owned by Patel, his wife Varsha and their company Millennium Developers in 2022, which was later confirmed by the PMLA’s adjudicating authority. ED had alleged that the properties were acquired from the widow of late drug lord Iqbal Mirchi through illegal transactions.Quashing this attachment order on Monday, the appellate tribunal said ED’s actions against the Patels were illegal since these properties were not involved in money laundering, or linked to Iqbal Mirchi. The tribunal further said that properties spanning 14,000 sq feet belonging to Hazra Memon and her two sons in Ceejay House were attached separately and a double attachment of another 14,000 sq feet belonging to the Patels was not required as it was not part of the proceeds of crime.While attaching flats belonging to the Patels, ED had alleged that they had purchased the property on which Ceejay House was built from Hazra Memon and gave her ownership of 14,000 sq feet of properties in Ceejay House.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive.

These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class. The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
Watch: Sunita Williams dances upon reaching International Space Station after Starliner mission,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-sunita-williams-dances-upon-reaching-international-space-station-after-starliner-mission/articleshow/110781478.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Boeing Starliner , piloted by Indian-origin astronaut Sunita Williams and her crewmate Butch Wilmore, successfully docked with the International Space Station ( ISS ) on Thursday. This mission marks a historic milestone as Williams becomes the first woman to pilot and test a new crewed spacecraft on its maiden voyage.Upon arrival, Williams celebrated her third trip to the ISS with a joyful dance, a gesture of her excitement and happiness. She was warmly welcomed by the seven astronauts aboard the station, who greeted her and Wilmore with the traditional ringing of a bell. Describing the crew as ""another family,"" Williams expressed her gratitude for the warm reception.After launching from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, the spacecraft docked with the ISS 26 hours later, despite a one-hour delay due to minor technical issues such as helium leaks. The mission's primary objective was to validate the Boeing Starliner as a viable alternative to the SpaceX Crew Module for ferrying astronauts under NASA's commercial crew program.The astronauts monitored the Starliner as it autonomously navigated a series of maneuvers to dock with the ISS. They also completed crucial tests, including manually flying the spacecraft for the first time in space. During their week-long stay, Williams and Wilmore will assist with tests and conduct scientific experiments.Reflecting on the mission, Williams said, ""It feels like going back home."" She is known for previously carrying an idol of Lord Ganesh and the Bhagavad Gita to space. Before liftoff, Williams, who helped design the Starliner, admitted to some pre-launch nerves but expressed excitement about the spacecraft she had named ""Calypso"" after the ship of the famed French oceanographer Jacques-Yves Cousteau.The astronauts' return journey will conclude with a landing on solid ground, unlike previous missions that ended with ocean landings.","The Boeing Starliner successfully docked with the International Space Station ( ISS ) on Thursday.

WHO confirms first fatal human case of H5N2 bird flu,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/who-confirms-first-fatal-human-case-of-h5n2-bird-flu/articleshow/110751897.cms,"A 59-year-old resident of the State of Mexico has died from bird flu in the first confirmed case of a human infected with the H5N2 variant , the World Health Organization (WHO) announced on Wednesday. The patient passed away on April 24 after experiencing fever, shortness of breath, diarrhea, and nausea. Despite having no history of exposure to poultry or other animals, the individual had multiple underlying medical conditions, including chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes, according to a statement from Mexico's health ministry.The WHO reported that the patient, who had been bedridden for three weeks prior to developing acute symptoms, was hospitalized in Mexico City and succumbed to the illness the same day. This case marks the first laboratory-confirmed human infection with an influenza A(H5N2) virus globally and the first avian H5 virus reported in a person in Mexico.""Although the source of exposure to the virus in this case is currently unknown, A(H5N2) viruses have been reported in poultry in Mexico,"" the WHO said. Mexican health authorities conducted laboratory tests and reported the confirmed case to the UN health body on May 23.In March, H5N2 cases were detected in a backyard poultry farm in Michoacan state, with other outbreaks identified in the State of Mexico. However, establishing a link between the human case and the poultry infections has been challenging. The WHO estimates the risk to the general population as ""low.""The Mexican health ministry emphasized that there is no risk of contagion for the population, noting that all samples from identified contacts of the patient have tested negative. Authorities are closely monitoring farms near the victim's home and have set up a permanent monitoring system to detect other cases in wildlife in the area.Andrew Pekosz, an influenza expert at Johns Hopkins University, highlighted the complexity of the situation, saying, ""How this individual got infected is a big question mark that at least this initial report doesn't really address thoroughly.""The WHO and Mexican health officials continue to investigate the source of the infection. Bird flu has been known to infect various mammals, including seals, raccoons, bears, and cattle, primarily due to contact with infected birds. Scientists remain vigilant for changes in the virus that could signal its adaptation to spread more easily among humans.In the United States, a different variant of bird flu, H5N1, has been spreading among dairy cow herds, with a small number of human cases reported. However, none of these cases involved human-to-human transmission.Australia also reported its first human case of A(H5N1) infection in May, with no signs of transmission, while noting more poultry cases of H7 bird flu on farms in Victoria state.Pekosz added, ""Since 1997, H5 viruses have continuously shown a propensity to infect mammals more than any other avian influenza virus. So it continues to ring that warning bell that we should be very vigilant about monitoring for these infections, because every spillover is an opportunity for that virus to try to accumulate those mutations that make it better infect humans.""(With inputs from agencies)","A 59-year-old resident of the State of Mexico has died from bird flu in the first confirmed case of a human infected with the H5N2 variant.

Boeing’s new capsule arrived at the International Space Station Thursday, delayed by last-minute thruster trouble that almost derailed the docking for this first test flight with astronauts .

The Starliner capsule already had one small helium leak when it rocketed into orbit with two Nasa astronauts — Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams — Wednesday. Boeing and Nasa managers were confident they could manage the propulsion system despite the problem and that more leaks were unlikely. But just hours into the flight, two more leaks cropped up. Later, four of the capsule’s 28 thrusters went down. The pilots managed to restart three of them, providing enough safety margin to proceed. It was not known whether the thrusters issue was tied to the leaks. Helium is used to pressurise fuel lines of the thrusters, essential for maneuovering.

Nasa astronauts gear up for Moonwalk with Artemis mission testing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nasa-astronauts-gear-up-for-moonwalk-with-artemis-mission-testing/articleshow/110774529.cms,"NEW DELHI: Nasa is preparing for a monumental milestone as astronauts gear up to walk on the Moon for the first time since 1972. Under the Artemis program, the space agency, in collaboration with industry partners, is developing new rockets, spacecraft, landers, and spacesuits to ensure the success of this ambitious mission.Recently, Nasa astronaut Doug “Wheels” Wheelock and Axiom Space astronaut Peggy Whitson conducted a crucial test involving full-scale developmental hardware of SpaceX’s Starship Human Landing System (HLS). This test, conducted on April 30 at SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, California, marked the first interaction between astronauts in pressurized spacesuits and a test version of the Starship HLS hardware.“With Artemis, Nasa is going to the Moon in a whole new way, with international partners and industry partners like Axiom Space and SpaceX. These partners are contributing their expertise and providing integral parts of the deep space architecture that they develop with Nasa’s insight and oversight,” said Amit Kshatriya, Nasa’s Moon to Mars program manager. “Integrated tests like this one, with key programs and partners working together, are crucial to ensure systems operate smoothly and are safe and effective for astronauts before they take the next steps on the Moon.”The day-long test provided valuable feedback on various aspects of the Starship HLS, including its layout, physical design, mechanical assemblies, and clearances. The test also evaluated the flexibility and agility of the spacesuits, known as the AxEMU (Axiom Extravehicular Mobility Unit).To begin the test, Wheelock and Whitson donned the spacesuits in the full-scale airlock on Starship’s airlock deck. The suits were pressurized using an external system that supplied air, electrical power, cooling, and communications. Each AxEMU included a full-scale model of the Portable Life Support System on the back of the suits. The astronauts assessed how easily the suits could be put on, taken off, and stowed in the airlock.Nasa and SpaceX engineers also evaluated the placement of mobility aids, such as handrails and ceiling straps, to assist astronauts in moving through the hatch and airlock. The astronauts practiced interacting with a control panel in the airlock to ensure the controls were accessible and functional while wearing gloves.“Overall, I was pleased with the astronauts’ operation of the control panel and with their ability to perform the difficult tasks they will have to do before stepping onto the Moon,” said Logan Kennedy, lead for surface activities in NASA’s HLS Program. “The test also confirmed that the amount of space available in the airlock, on the deck, and in the elevator, are sufficient for the work our astronauts plan to do.”The astronauts also tested the elevator designed to transport them from Starship’s airlock deck to the lunar surface. Whitson and Wheelock practiced opening the elevator gate, evaluating the dexterity of the AxEMU suit gloves, and lowering the ramp that will be used to take the next steps on the Moon.These steps are vital in preparing for the Artemis III mission, where SpaceX’s Starship HLS will dock with Orion in lunar orbit to transport two astronauts to and from the Moon’s surface. Axiom Space is providing next-generation spacesuits designed to accommodate a wider range of astronauts.With the Artemis program, Nasaaims to explore more of the Moon than ever before, learn how to live and work away from Earth, and prepare for future human exploration of Mars.","Nasa is preparing for a monumental milestone as astronauts gear up to walk on the Moon for the first time since 1972.

Trump will campaign in Arizona following his hush money conviction,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-will-campaign-in-arizona-following-his-hush-money-conviction/articleshow/110768608.cms,"PHOENIX: Donald Trump returns to the campaign trail Thursday with a trip to Arizona, his first appearance in a battleground state since he was convicted in a hush money scandal. Trump is scheduled to speak at a town hall in Phoenix organised by Turning Point, a conservative youth organisation that has seen its influence rise alongside Trump's takeover of the GOP.Trump responded defiantly to the verdict against him a day after a New York jury found him guilty last week of a scheme to illegally influence the 2016 election through a hush money payment to a porn actor. But he has not spoken directly to the swing-state voters who will decide the November election.He is likely to find a friendly audience at Turning Point. Led by Charlie Kirk , the group has harnessed the energy of young people drawn to Trump's Make America Great Again movement by cultivating conservative influencers and hosting glitzy events. And it's made Kirk and his allies wealthy.Nowhere is Turning Point's influence greater than in Arizona, the group's adopted home state where its loyalists have taken on prominent roles in the state GOP but have struggled to win general elections. Turning Point's slate of conservative candidates lost in the 2022 midterms, including Kari Lake, who lost the race for governor and is now running for US Senate.The group is looking to expand its influence this year to other battleground states and got a boost when Trump ousted former Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel in February. She was replaced by Trump's hand-picked successor, his daughter-in-law Lara Trump, who has spoken positively about working with Turning Point.President Joe Biden won Arizona in 2020 by about 10,000 votes. It was, along with Georgia, one of two states decided by less than half a percentage point and is expected to be close again this year.Arizona Republicans have enthusiastically embraced Trump's lie that the 2020 election was stolen from him. State lawmakers commissioned an unprecedented partisan recount that confirmed his loss. Cochise County officials in southern Arizona are facing criminal charges for refusing to certify the 2022 midterm election results.Hours before Trump is scheduled to speak, Jake Hoffman, a Republican state senator who is also a top Turning Point consultant, will be arraigned for his role in an alleged plot to overturn Trump's loss in Arizona. Hoffman is accused of being a fake elector who signed a document falsely claiming to represent Arizona in the Electoral College.Trump's former chief of staff, Mark Meadows, is scheduled for arraignment in the same case on Friday.Despite the state's importance on the presidential map, Trump has not campaigned in Arizona since 2022, when he held a rally to support his slate of midterm candidates, all of whom ended up losing.Trump's trip west includes several private fundraisers and a rally on Sunday in Nevada, another battleground state he lost narrowly in 2020.",Trump is scheduled to speak at a town hall in Phoenix organised by Turning Point.

Authorities are urging people to stay indoors, hydrate and avoid unnecessary travel. Demand for power has surged because of the high temperatures, putting a strain on existing electricity sources.UNICEF said resilient energy refers to reliable, flexible, accessible and quality power supplies that can withstand and recover quickly from unanticipated shocks, such as power outages and floods.It said more resilient energy supplies for schools would reduce dropout rates and improve children’s learning so they can earn more in the future.“Children depend on schools, health centers and safe drinking water for their survival, yet these facilities often don’t have the electricity supply to function optimally. As the current heatwave grips the country, electricity needs have skyrocketed, leading to shortfalls that can endanger children’s health,” said Abdullah Fadil, the UNICEF representative in Pakistan.UNICEF said 3.5 billion people live without reliable power worldwide.It said climate change is contributing to the disruption of generation and distribution of energy in Pakistan, where floods triggered by climate-induced monsoon rains in 2022 killed 1,739 people. It said almost half of the water infrastructure, such as storage tanks, wells and supply lines, was damaged by the floods.This year, Pakistan recorded its wettest April since 1961 with more than double the usual rainfall for the month. Heavy rains last month killed scores of people and destroyed property and farmland.Daytime temperatures in May have soared as much as 8 C (14 F) above average temperatures for the month over the last 20 years, raising fears of flooding in the northwest because of glacial melting.UNICEF said it helped restore water systems for 350,000 people in 375 locations after the 2022 floods and has also implemented several solar electrification initiatives in Pakistan.“Pakistan has an abundance of renewable resources and by investing in them we are tapping into a goldmine to help children,” Fadil said. ""We need the private sector to play a bigger role as public sector resources will not be enough. This is everybody’s business.”","UNICEF says developing resilient energy systems to power health facilities in Pakistan could avert over 175,000 deaths by 2030.

The tobacco industry 's targeting of youth is rampant across our member states. As a result, we have a very worrying 11 million adolescents using various tobacco products. Coupled with the approximate 411 million adult tobacco users, our region, unfortunately, has the highest number of adolescent and adult users globally,"" Wazed said in a statement.The tobacco industry lures youths by aggressively introducing new nicotine and tobacco products such as electronic cigarettes and heated tobacco products, which are becoming increasingly popular among the youths in the region, she said.This multibillion-dollar industry recruits new tobacco users to reward their investors with even more profits. To achieve this, it preys on children and adolescents through marketing tactics, targeting them with new products, Wazed stated.""It is worrying that children and adolescents are regularly exposed to the digital marketing of tobacco products. This is despite having policies and regulations in place to prevent this,"" she said.""This situation is likely to get worse, as youngsters spend more time on social media and other similar platforms,"" Wazed said, highlighting that personalised and targeted advertising by the industry appears to dominate here, exposing them to harm.This year's theme for World No Tobacco Day is 'Protecting Children from Tobacco Industry Interference'.The tobacco industry is fast to launch new products, using every means to expand market share before the regulations can catch up, she said.It continues to oppose evidence-based measures, such as increases in excise taxes, and comprehensive bans on tobacco advertising, promotions and sponsorships. The companies even threaten legal action against governments that try to protect the health of their citizens, the WHO regional director added.Wazed pointed out that the response from governments and institutions lags in the matter.""Our efforts are complicated by the rapid changes in the marketing strategies of the tobacco industry,"" she said, emphasising that the relevant provisions of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) '? including Article 5.3 '? should be implemented in letter and spirit.Also, necessary tools and support are urgently needed to facilitate monitoring and implementation of the WHO FCTC recommendations in 'online' settings, she added.""Our goal for our youth is clear.

Leicester's Diwali festival under threat as council can't afford the costs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/leicesters-diwali-festival-under-threat-as-council-cant-afford-the-costs/articleshow/110776008.cms,"LONDON: Leicester’s Diwali celebrations — considered to be the largest outside India — could get cancelled as the city council which funds them can no longer afford the massive costs .

The two-day event, which consists of a spectacular switch-on of 6,000 LED lights shaped as diyas, on the Golden Mile and stage performances, fair rides and fireworks two weeks before Diwali, and then another event, including live music and a lantern procession on Diwali Day, costs Leicester city council £250,000 (Rs 2.6 crore).

Leicester mayor Sir Peter Soulsby now says the £250,000 price tag is “unsustainable”. This has triggered Conservative Leicester East candidate Shivani Raja and former MP Keith Vaz to start petitions to the council calling for the celebrations, which attract over 40,000 people and benefit local businesses, to be saved.

A city council spokesperson said: “We recently met with members of the Leicester Hindu Festival Council and local ward councillors to advise them that funding for all of the council’s festivals and events is under review, owing to huge pressures on the council’s finances. Having announced last Sep that funding two events for Diwali was no longer sustainable, we’re now reviewing whether we can support even one event – which would cost £130k — without significant funding from elsewhere. It’s important to emphasise that no decisions have yet been made, but we wanted to be open with our partners while there’s still time to explore possible sources of alternative funding.”

Labour candidate for Leicester East Rajesh Agrawal said the issue was getting raised on the doorsteps during canvassing.“The council is under huge financial pressure ,” he said, “and the future of these celebrations is uncertain. We need more sources of funding. Having been deputy mayor of London, I know how important such events are to promote a city. I am determined to save them.”

The EU General Court said in its judgement that the US fast food giant failed to prove that it was genuinely using the Big Mac name over a five-year period for chicken sandwiches, poultry products or restaurants.The Big Mac is a hamburger made of two beef patties, cheese, lettuce, onions, pickles and Big Mac sauce, according to the company’s website. The decision is about more than burger names. It opens the door for Galway-based Supermac’s expansion into other EU countries. The dispute erupted when Supermac’s applied to register its company name in the EU as it drew up its expansion plans. McDonald’s objected, saying consumers would be confused because it already trademarked the Big Mac name. Supermac’s portrayed the decision as a David and Goliath-style victory. Managing Director Pat McDonagh accused McDonald’s of “trademark bullying to stifle competition”.McDonald’s was unfazed by the ruling, which can be appealed to the European Court of Justice, the bloc’s highest court. “The decision does not affect our right to use the ‘BIG MAC’ trademark,” it said.",The EU General Court said in its judgement that the US fast food giant failed to prove that it was genuinely using the Big Mac name.

This revelation came to light when a park visitor, while exploring the area, noticed the concealed pipe and posted images on social media. The images quickly went viral, prompting a widespread discussion about the park's practices.The park authorities have acknowledged the existence of the pipe but defended its use, citing the need to maintain the waterfall’s flow during dry seasons. ""The pipe is there to ensure the waterfall remains beautiful and continues to attract tourists, even when natural water levels are low,"" a park representative explained. The official added that the park is committed to providing a pleasant experience for visitors and maintaining the area’s visual appeal.However, this justification has not quelled public criticism. Many visitors feel deceived, believing that they were witnessing a natural wonder. ""I came here to see the beauty of nature, not a man-made spectacle,"" said one disillusioned tourist.

Drinking alcohol on airplanes can have unexpected consequences,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/drinking-alcohol-on-airplanes-can-have-unexpected-consequences/articleshow/110775435.cms,"NEW DELHI: A recent study highlights how consuming alcohol on airplanes can have significant effects on the body, including intensified feelings of drunkenness due to cabin pressure and dehydration. The findings have been detailed in a new report, shedding light on the peculiar ways in which alcohol interacts with the unique environment of an aircraft.According to research published by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), the lower cabin pressure and reduced oxygen levels experienced during flight can alter the way alcohol is metabolized. ""Drinking alcohol at high altitudes can affect the body differently,"" says Dr. George Koob , director of the NIAAA. ""Even moderate amounts of alcohol can lead to higher levels of intoxication compared to ground level.""On an airplane, the cabin pressure is typically equivalent to an altitude of 6,000 to 8,000 feet, much lower than at sea level. This lower pressure means that oxygen is less available, and the body's ability to absorb alcohol changes. Dr. Koob explains, ""In an environment with reduced oxygen, the effects of alcohol can be more pronounced, potentially causing passengers to feel more impaired than they would otherwise.""Additionally, the dry cabin air can contribute to dehydration, a condition exacerbated by alcohol consumption. Dr. Koob notes, ""Alcohol is a diuretic, and combined with the already dehydrating conditions on an aircraft, it can lead to significant dehydration. Passengers should be mindful of their alcohol intake and drink plenty of water.""The report also highlights potential safety concerns associated with drinking on flights. The combination of alcohol and altitude can impair cognitive and motor functions, posing risks to passenger safety and comfort. According to Dr. Koob, ""Air travel can already be stressful and disorienting for some people. Adding alcohol into the mix can amplify these effects and potentially lead to disruptive behavior or health issues.""Airlines have guidelines and regulations concerning alcohol consumption on board, with many airlines limiting the amount of alcohol served and monitoring passenger behavior. Flight attendants are trained to handle situations where passengers may become overly intoxicated, ensuring the safety and well-being of everyone on board.Experts recommend that passengers limit their alcohol intake while flying and be aware of the amplified effects of drinking at high altitudes. ""Moderation is key,"" advises Dr. Koob. ""Understanding how your body reacts to alcohol in the air can help prevent unwanted side effects and ensure a safer and more pleasant flight experience.""The study concludes with practical tips for travelers, suggesting that they drink water regularly, avoid overconsumption of alcohol, and eat before consuming any alcoholic beverages to help mitigate its effects. Dr. Koob emphasizes, ""Staying hydrated and being mindful of your alcohol consumption can make a significant difference in your overall comfort and safety while flying.""As awareness of these findings grows, both airlines and passengers are encouraged to take a more informed approach to alcohol consumption during flights.","A recent study highlights how consuming alcohol on airplanes can have significant effects on the body.

This groundbreaking find is crucial for understanding how climate change has shaped the landscape over millions of years.The discovery was made by a team of scientists from the University of Arizona , led by geoscientist Dr Stewart Jamieson. ""The Rio Grande is unlike anything we have seen in Antarctica,"" Dr Jamieson said. ""This river system was buried under ice for millions of years and offers a unique window into the past.""The Rio Grande, which rivals some of the world's largest rivers, was identified through satellite imagery and radar data. The river's channels stretch over 680 miles, and it likely played a significant role in transporting water and sediment across the continent during a warmer period in Earth's history, a Newsweek report.The presence of the Rio Grande suggests that Antarctica once had a much milder climate, with conditions that could support flowing water. This finding challenges previous assumptions about the continent's glacial history and indicates that parts of Antarctica may have been ice-free during certain periods.""The implications of this discovery are profound,"" said Dr Jamieson. ""It changes our understanding of the Antarctic ice sheet and its stability. Knowing that such a large river system existed implies that the ice sheet was much smaller than we thought.""The research team plans to conduct further studies to determine the age of the river system and the climatic conditions that allowed it to form. These investigations could provide valuable data for predicting future changes in the Antarctic ice sheet in response toglobal warming .The discovery of the Rio Grande also raises questions about the potential for similar hidden river systems in other parts of Antarctica. ""We are just scratching the surface,"" Dr Jamieson noted. ""There could be other river systems buried beneath the ice, waiting to be discovered.""As climate change continues to impact the polar regions, understanding the history of Antarctica's ice and water systems becomes increasingly important. The findings from the Rio Grande will help scientists develop more accurate models of ice sheet dynamics and sea-level rise.This discovery highlights the importance of continued exploration and research in Antarctica. It underscores the need for international collaboration to uncover the secrets of this remote and largely unexplored continent.","The discovery was made by a team of scientists from the University of Arizona.

'Does it hurt?'

KITAKYUSHU: As Japan plays host to a record influx of tourists, one of the country's more private attractions -- the high-tech toilet -- is becoming a must-have in luxury bathrooms worldwide.With their warm seats and precision spray technology, bidet toilets are the norm in Japan, where more than 80 percent of homes have one, according to a government survey.Now sales are surging abroad and especially in the United States, led by A-list bidet fans such as Drake, the Kardashians and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.Japanese company TOTO , which pioneered the electric bidets it claims have sparked ""a global revolution from wiping to washing"", says overseas revenue for toilets has roughly doubled from 100 billion yen ($673 million) in 2012.The pandemic was a key driver, bringing a home-renovation boom but also germ-conscious consumers desperate for an alternative to toilet paper after shelves were cleared by panic-buyers.Senior TOTO executive Shinya Tamura, who oversees international business, told AFP the brand's growth has been a word-of-mouth success.When people first learn how the toilets' water jets work, with pressure and temperature controls, ""there's an image that it's not pleasant"".But ""we can't explain how good it is with words. You need to experience it"", Tamura said.""After a while, most users can't live without it.""The company's international net sales for housing equipment are currently less than a third of those in Japan.It wants to boost sales in the Americas by 19 percent over two years to ""establish a solid position"" there and offset less urgent demand in China.But with more people in the market for a squeaky clean bum, US competitors are challenging TOTO and its Japanese rivals such as Panasonic and LIXIL for their throne.At a major tech fair in Las Vegas this year, the marketing manager of US brand Kohler called its Numi 2.0 -- which takes spoken instructions via an in-built Amazon Alexa -- ""the smartest toilet that exists"".Just like top-end Japanese models, the Numi 2.0 has an automatic deodoriser and a motion-activated lid that opens when you enter the bathroom and closes when you leave.Its spray wand has pulsating and oscillating functions, and users can adjust the warm-air dryer in minute detail.But such pampering comes at a price: around $8,500 to $10,000, compared to around $500 for more basic bidet seats.Americans who travel to Japan are often inspired to upgrade their toilet, a salesman at Ardy's Bath Collection in Beverly Hills told AFP.""They see it in the airport, and they see it in public restrooms, and they use it, and they're like, 'wow, this is great,'"" he said.Bidets are ""popular everywhere"" but it's still a ""private experience"" and ""weird to talk about"" for some customers.Although fancy Japanese-style toilets are fast becoming a status symbol, TOTO's executives have long fought prudishness when trying to expand abroad.After the US launch of its Washlet bidet in 1986, the firm struggled to place advertisements, and its pop-up event was kicked out of a high-end mall because other stores complained.","Japanese company TOTO says overseas revenue for toilets has roughly doubled from 100 billion yen ($673 million) in 2012.
