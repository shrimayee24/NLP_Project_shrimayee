Security agencies prepared for all eventualities as Hasina headed towards India in an Air Force jet.Around 3pm, Indian Air Force radars detected a low-flying aircraft approaching the Indian border from Bangladesh.Air defense personnel, aware of the high-profile passenger onboard, allowed the aircraft to enter Indian airspace. To provide security, two Rafale fighter jets from the 101 squadron at Hashimara air base in West Bengal were deployed over Bihar and Jharkhand, according to ANI.The aircraft followed its designated flight path, closely monitored by ground agencies, with constant communication between the plane and top Indian security officials.

NEW DELHI: On the fifth anniversary of the abrogation of Article 370 , PM Narendra Modi on Monday recalled the legislation passed by Parliament on Aug 5, 2019, as a ""watershed moment in the country's history"", which, he said, heralded a new era of progress and prosperity in J&K and Ladakh regions. The PM assured people of J&K and Ladakh that his govt would keep working for them and fulfil their aspirations in the coming times.""Today, we mark five years since the Parliament of India decided to abrogate Articles 370 and 35(A), a watershed moment in our nation's history,"" Modi said in a post on X.""It meant the Constitution of India was implemented in these places in letter and spirit, in line with the vision of the great men and women who made the Constitution.""With abrogation (of Article 370) came security , dignity and opportunity for women, youth, backwards, tribal and marginalised communities who were deprived of the fruits of development, PM Narendra Modi said. “It ensured that corruption, which plagued J&K for decades, has been kept at bay,” he added.Home minister Amit Shah, who anchored passage of the legislation, termed abrogation of Articles 370 and 35A as a transformative decision, ushering in a new era of empowerment for marginalised sections and strengthened grassroots democracy in J&K and Ladakh.“The region’s youth have driven socio-economic growth and cultural revival, making Modi govt’s efforts to foster peace and comprehensive development a grand success. We thank Modi for this landmark decision & reaffirm our dedication to advancing the region’s aspirations and transformative progress,” he said.Meanwhile, in the foreword of a book on the legislation, ‘370: Undoing the Unjust, A New Future for J&K’, the PM said, “There was complete clarity in my mind that taking the public in J&K into confidence was absolutely essential for execution of the decision.”“We wanted the decision, whenever it would be taken, to happen with concurrence of the people rather than imposition,” he said.The book, researched and written by non-profit organisation BlueKraft Digital Foundation, was published under the Penguin Enterprise imprint. It is scheduled to release this month.","The PM assured people of J&K and Ladakh that his govt would keep working for them and fulfil their aspirations in the coming times.

SC validates LG's unilateral nomination of 10 aldermen to MCD,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-validates-lgs-unilateral-nomination-of-10-aldermen-to-mcd/articleshow/112302593.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a big setback to AAP govt , the Supreme Court on Monday ruled that Lieutenant Governor of Delhi is empowered by a Parliament enacted law to unilaterally nominate 10 aldermen to Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) and is not bound by the aid and advice of the Arvind Kejriwal dispensation.A bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices P S Narasimha and J B Pardiwala said the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, after the 1993 amendment by Parliament, has expressly empowered LG to nominate persons with special knowledge to the MCD on his own.“The context in which the power is located confirms that the LG is intended to act as per the mandate of the statute and not to be guided by the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers,” it said greenlighting the LG’s decision to nominate 10 members to MCD on Jan 3, 2023, a month after AAP won 134 of 250 seats in the elections to the MCD. BJP had won 104 seats.The blow for Kejriwal government clears the way for election for the Standing Committees of MCD. Mayor Shelley Oberoi, who belongs to AAP, has refused to constitute the Standing Committee, crucial for the functioning of the city as every project exceeding Rs 5 crore in value to be cleared by them, by citing Delhi government's challenge to the nomination of aldermen by LG. SC 's rejection of the argument may clear the way for constitution of the vital bodies.AAP govt had moved SC directly challenging the constitutional validity of 10 nominations by the LG. Senior advocate A M Singhvi had argued that the Constitution mandates a governor to strictly go by the aid and advice of an elected govt. LG through senior advocate Sanjay Jain had defended the nominations citing his exclusive powers under the Delhi Municipal Corporation (DMC) Act, 1993.Writing the judgment, Justice Narasimha referred to the 2023 judgment of 5-Judge bench led by CJI Chandrachud, which while declaring that bureaucracy was within the domain of the elected government, that had ruled that “if Parliament makes a law in relation to any subject in List II and List III (state and concurrent lists), the executive power of Delhi government can be limited to the extent as provided under the Parliament-enacted law.“Having examined Section 3(3)(b)(i) of the DMC Act empowering the Lt. Governor to nominate persons having special knowledge to the DMC, we will underscore the point that it is law made by Parliament. As the law requires the LG to exercise the power of nomination, it satisfies the exception contemplated under Article 239AA(4) to act in his discretion as he is by or under any law so required to act,” he said.The bench said, “The statutory power under DMC Act to nominate persons of special knowledge was vested in the LG for the first time by the 1993 amendment to the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 to incorporate the Constitutional changes through Articles 239AA, 239AB and introduction of Part IX-A relating to municipalities. The power to nominate is therefore not a vestige of the past or a power of the Administrator that is continued by default. It is made to incorporate change in the Constitutional structure of NCTD.”After delineating legislative and executive relationship between the Centre and Delhi government and a threadbare analysis of provisions of DMC Act, Justice Narasimha said, “The provisions of the Act relating to the LG are relating to matters such as nomination of experts, Election Commissioner, constituting Finance Commission, convening the first meeting of the Corporation, acting as an appellate authority, etc. These functions seem to suggest that they are intended to enable the authority (LG) in which the power is vested to act as an independent body.""","Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices P S Narasimha and J B Pardiwala said the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, after the 1993 amendment by Parliament, has expressly empowered LG to nominate persons with special knowledge to the MCD on his own. “The context in which the power is located confirms that the LG is intended to act as per the mandate of the statute,” it said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112302591,imgsize-916908,width-400,resizemode-4/112302591.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Former minority affairs minister and senior BJP leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi has urged the Waqf system to move beyond its ""touch-me-not"" syndrome, following the government's plan to introduce a Bill to amend the 1995 law governing Waqf boards. This amendment aims to ensure more accountability and transparency in their functioning and mandates the inclusion of women in these bodies.Sources indicate this move is in response to demands from within the Muslim community .The proposed Bill would require Waqf boards to register their properties with district collectors to establish their actual valuation.Naqvi expressed his views through a post on X, emphasizing the need for the Waqf system to adapt and modernize.""The Waqf system will have to come out of the madness of 'touch-me-not' syndrome-politics,"" Naqvi stated.He further commented on the resistance to change, saying, ""communal attack on inclusive reforms is not right.""Several Muslim organizations and clerics, including the All India Muslim Personal Law Board , have expressed their opposition to the proposed amendments .

The state should also clarify the nature of survey or data in its possession prior to designating these 77 communities as OBCs, it said.It was a fiery beginning to arguments as senior advocate Indira Jaising, appearing for the TMC govt, launched a scathing criticism of the HC for bringing reservations for OBCs to a standstill in the state and went on to say the HC wanted that for inclusion of every community in the OBC list, the state must pass a legislation.""If the HC wants to run the govt, let it run. But I need an answer from the Supreme Court,"" Jaising said, and added that the HC quashed the additions to the OBC list because they belonged to the Muslim community, many of whom were already included in the Centre's OBC list.A host of senior advocates - Mukul Rohatgi, P S Patwalia, Ranjit Kumar, Guru Krishna Kumar with advocate Bansuri Swaraj - termed the state's decision to include the 77 communities, within months of CM Mamata Banerjee making an announcement in a rally, as an ""egregious act"".","Supreme Court on Monday refused to stay Calcutta high court's May 22 judgment quashing inclusion of 77 communities, 75 of them Muslims, in West Bengal's OBC list.

Hasina’s ouster puts a big question mark on India-Bangladesh defence ties,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hasinas-ouster-puts-a-big-question-mark-on-india-bangladesh-defence-ties/articleshow/112297939.cms,"Big Shock For Sheikh Hasina From UK; This Is London's 'Reply' To Ex-Bangladesh PM's Asylum Appeal

NEW DELHI: Just when India was poised to take its traditionally good defence-military ties with Bangladesh on a sharp upward trajectory in a bid to stem China’s major strategic inroads into the country, the fleeing of Sheikh Hasina from her country on Monday has injected an air of uncertainty into the entire equation.Bangladesh Army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman (58), a career infantry officer who declared his force was taking over the country’s reins and would soon announce an interim govt, was in fact slated to visit India later this month.“It would have been Gen Waker-Uz-Zaman’s first foreign visit after becoming the Army chief on June 23 for a three-year tenure. Despite China’s expanding influence in Bangladesh, Dhaka’s bilateral defence ties with New Delhi were on an upswing. But everything is in a state of flux now,” a source said.Just a month ago, Bangladesh had inked a deal with Indian defence shipyard GRSE in Kolkata to build an 800-tonne advanced ocean-going tug, in the first major deal inked under the $500-million line of credit for defence purchases extended by New Delhi to Dhaka, which was operationalized last year.The contract coincided with Navy chief Admiral Dinesh Tripathi’s four-day visit to Bangladesh to further consolidate defence ties and explore new avenues for maritime cooperation. Admiral Tripathi held discussions with Gen Waker-Uz-Zaman as well as the naval and air force chiefs, Admiral M Nazmul Hassan and Air Marshal Hasan Mahmood Khan, during the visit.“Talks were underway for Bangladesh to buy Indian offshore patrol vessels as well as get spares for maintenance for its Russian-origin MiG-29 and Mi-17 helicopters. Apart from joint exercises and capacity-building programmes, Indian military establishments have been training Bangladeshi defence personnel for decades,” the source said.The Indian defence establishment is now in a wait-and-watch mode to see how events unfold in Bangladesh, including the interim govt’s composition and its impact on bilateral military ties.“Gen Waker-Uz-Zaman is pro-India. As the principal staff officer of the Armed Forces Division of Bangladesh earlier, he co-chaired with the Indian defence secretary the bilateral annual defence dialogues in 2022 and 2023,” another source said.“But if the interim govt is filled with representatives from the anti-India Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and radical outfits like Jamaat-e-Islami, matters may well head south. The Jamaat has also spread its influence in the Bangladeshi military over the years,” he added.Then, there is China. Bangladesh was the second biggest recipient globally of Chinese arms in the 2019-2023 timeframe, notching up 11% of them as compared to 61% of Pakistan.Overall, Bangladesh sources 70-80% of its arms imports from China, which has ranged from F-7 fighter jets, main-battle tanks and corvettes to naval guns, surface-to-air missiles, rifles and ammunition.China had even supplied two old Ming-class submarines to Bangladesh at a hugely discounted price in 2016. Apart from a wide variety of civil infrastructure projects, China has also helped Bangladesh build its first full-fledged submarine base at Pekua in Cox’s Bazaar, which was commissioned as BNS Sheikh Hasina in Dec last year.",Bangladesh Army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman was in fact slated to visit India later this month.

He stressed the need for New Delhi to engage with key stakeholders in Dhaka to protect mutual interests.“An unstable Bangladesh could contribute to instability in our own country, which we want to avoid. Therefore, a peaceful, prosperous, and stable Bangladesh is in India’s best interest.

Welcoming Shukla and other crew, Axiom Space said X: “Welcome to Houston #Ax4! This week the crew... will begin training with their commander AstroPeggy.” The Ax-4 crewmembers begin training with Axiom Space, NASA and SpaceX.The mission will place significant emphasis on scientific research, technology demonstrations, and the commercialisation of space. Additionally, the mission aims to foster cooperation by sharing knowledge, resources and opportunities with our partners, solidifying these nations as leaders within the growing space community.Back in India, Isro chairman S Somanath said a Gaganyatri will be “conducting five experiments”, some of which have been developed in India and will be onboard Axiom-Mission 4. During an online interaction with citizens, Somanath said, “We will also conduct some international experiments in collaboration with other space agencies, which are currently under discussion and at development stages.”He further elaborated that when an Indianastronaut goes to the ISS, the objective is not just limited to experiments but also encompasses the entire process of learning. “A Gaganyatri flying to the ISS will help us understand how India should prepare for Gaganyaan. When the astronaut experiences the flight, we can learn from how they conduct the mission and how the spacecraft docks with the ISS.

Centre: Landslides tied to Kerala governments' neglect,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-landslides-tied-to-kerala-governments-neglect/articleshow/112302327.cms,"TOI

Background

NEW DELHI: Blaming the successive Kerala governments for its sheer neglect of environmental factors that led to the Wayanad disaster , Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav on Monday said the local government did not pay attention to “expansion of illegal human habitation and mining” in ecologically fragile areas , and kept on allowing such activities over the years that led to the devastating landslides on July 30.“Such activities were allowed by the state in the past 10 years without keeping in view the soil topography, rock conditions, mountain slope, vegetation structure and overall geomorphology of the ecologically fragile region,” said Yadav.Records show that the Kerala government gave approval to as many as nine projects, including four of mining , in the state during the past three years (2022-24) whereas environment ministry permitted one project - construction of twin tunnel between Anakkampoyil Kalladi-Meppadi in Kozhikode and Wayanad districts - during the period. On ministry’s approval, Yadav said that the lone project was approved in-principle (stage-I) and the construction has not yet started there.The minister said he now expects the Kerala government to work with a central committee and give its consent to the sixth draft, issued by the centre on July 31, for notifying ecologically sensitive area (ESA) within its jurisdiction of the Western Ghats at the earliest so that environmentally hazardous activities including mining and big construction projects could be immediately prohibited.Referring to the sixth draft, he said the Centre is ready to notify ESA in a phased manner if one or the other state individually or collectively agrees for it. The move, as reported bylast week, will hasten the process of notifying ESA state by state without waiting for the consensus from all the six states - Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Goal, Maharashtra and Gujarat - at the same time.In a departure from the previous drafts that expected all six states to come on board simultaneously, the latest draft made a provision where final notification of Western Ghats ESA can be done in a “phased manner either state-wise or through a combined single notification”.The draft proposes earmarking of 56,825 sq km as ESA to prohibit/regulate environmentally hazardous human activities within the fragile Western Ghats, spread over six states. The proposed ESA comprises of 9,993 sq km in Kerala; 20,668 sq km in Karnataka; 17,340 sq km in Maharashtra; 6,914 sq km in Tamil Nadu; 1,461 sq km in Goa and 449 sq km in Gujarat, recommending prohibiting or regulating certain human activities in those areas.The draft proposed complete ban on mining, quarrying, sand mining and high polluting (Red category) industries. It said all existing mines will be phased out within five years from the date of issue of the final notification or on the expiry of the existing mining lease (whichever is earlier).Besides, it also prohibited setting up any new thermal power projects and expansion of existing power plants within the ESA. Construction of projects of 20,000 sq m and above; and all new and expansion of townships, and development projects with an area of 50 hectares and above or with built up area of 1.5 lakh sq m and above will also be prohibited after final notification.On the other hand, it proposed regulation of hydro-power projects, essential services and low-polluting (Orange & White categories) industries.The need for a sixth draft arose as states failed to come on board for earmarking ESA within their respective jurisdiction in the Western Ghats. The first draft notification to earmark ESA was issued in March, 2014 but the proposal remains on paper since then. In the meantime, the ministry had issued four more drafts in 2015, 2017, 2018 and 2022.The central govt and an expert committee had discussed the fifth draft with states - Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu - nine times during July, 2022-March, 2024 but it could not finalise the ESA notification due to objection from states - initially from Kerala, Maharashtra and Goa and later mainly from Karnataka.The then Karnataka govt even requested the Centre to withdraw the draft notification in 2022, arguing that ESA, covering 20,668 sq km of area within the state, would adversely affect the livelihood of people due to ban on certain activities.The draft, however, clearly specifies that agriculture, plantation and less polluting activities will not be affected due to the ESA provisions and the actual area will be finalised based on the recommendation of the states.","Kerala government gave approval to as many as nine projects, including four of mining, in the state during the past three years. Environment ministry permitted one project - construction of twin tunnel between Anakkampoyil Kalladi-Meppadi in Kozhikode and Wayanad districts.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112302389,imgsize-1222845,width-400,resizemode-4/112302389.jpg"
Government set to table Waqf Act Amendment Bill in this session,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-set-to-table-waqf-act-amendment-bill-in-this-session/articleshow/112302198.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Bill to amend Waqf Act is likely to be introduced in Parliament during current session, sources said, adding it has been discussed with alliance partners. This comes against the backdrop of continuous demands and representations made by common Muslims to make the regulation of Waqf properties more transparent, said Union parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju on Monday.Rijiju, however, did not share details of the Bill. Endorsing the proposed amendments and emphasising their potential benefits for both the Waqf system and the broader community, BJP's Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, said, ""It's good for both - Waqf and 'waqt (time)'.""On reports that Centre is likely to bring a Bill to curb ""unfettered"" powers of Waqf Boards over assets, Naqvi said, ""It's needed to take out Waqf system from the 'touch me not' thinking. Neither it's good for country nor for the community to impose a communal mentality over inclusive reform. It's good for both - Waqf and 'waqt', to find a logical solution to a long pending problem... I don't know what the actual proposal is but I believe that it's needed.""BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawala said, ""For a long time, Muslim community was demanding transparency & accountability in the system of Waqf Board. Waqf holds third-largest land ownership (in India). It holds properties worth lakhs of crores, however, its income is less than Rs 200 crore... Waqf became a medium for 10-15 influential families to establish a new zamindari system.""The proposed Bill will make it mandatory for Waqf Boards to register their properties with district collectors, ensuring accurate valuation.There are currently 30 Waqf Boards across India, managing properties worth crores. Revenue generated from these properties is estimated at Rs 200 crore annually, underscoring the need for stricter oversight.","The Bill to amend Waqf Act is likely to be introduced in Parliament during current session, sources said.

Significant decline in terror-related incidents in Jammu and Kashmir under Modi government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/significant-decline-in-terror-related-incidents-in-jammu-and-kashmir-under-modi-government/articleshow/112298859.cms,"NEW DELHI: There has been a 69 per cent dip in terror-related incidents and a 67 per cent fall in resulting casualties in Jammu and Kashmir over the past 10 years of Narendra Modi government , as compared to the records from UPA’s term between 2004 and 2014.As per official data on J&K security situation shared by home ministry sources, organised stone pelting incidents, organised hartals, civilian deaths in stone pelting incidents and injuries to both civilians and security forces personnel due to stone pelting were down to ‘zero’ last year from a high of 2654, 132, 112 and 6235 respectively in 2010.Sources said terror related incidents were down from 7217 between 2004 and 2014 to 2263 between 2014 and July 31, 2024 (69 per cent decline), with civilian killings down to 353 from 1769 (80 per cent fall) and security personnel deaths down to 591 from 1060 (44 per cent decline) in the same period.“The Modi regime has adopted a zero-tolerance approach to terror in its quest to make J&K terror-free. The strategy includes a tough security actionplan, neutralising the capabilities and efforts of terrorists, checking local terror recruitment and radicalisation of youths by keeping them gainfully engaged, and adopting a multi-focal approach to check infiltration,” a senior MHA official told TOI.While stone-pelting incidents came down from 1328 in 2018, the year prior to abrogation of Article 370, to ‘nil’ in 2023, ceasefire violations on Indo-Pak border fell from 390 in 2018 to 9 last year and 3 from January to June this year.Terrorist-initiated attacks were down to 46 in 2023 and 11 between January to July this year, from 228 in 2018. As many as 91 security personnel were killed in 2018, which declined to 30 in 2023 and 17 until July 31 this year. Civilian killings in terrorist-initiated encounters fell to 14 both in 2023 and till July 31 this year from 55 in 2018.MHA sources told TOI that the decline in terrorism is thanks to measures taken to dismantle the terror eco-system, such as attachment and freezing of properties linked to terror, collective disposal of UAPA cases and dismissal of govt employees and denial of govt benefits like passports and public contracts to anybody found linked to terror.Another key change since 2019 is keeping the J&K police the lead in counter-terror operations.NIA and J&K SIA have registered 22 terror financing cases in which 229 persons have been arrested and assets worth Rs 150 crore and 57 properties sealed. Another 90 properties were attached and 134 bank accounts frozen in terror financing cases.“As many as a dozen terrorist organisations and 37 individuals were banned under UAPA,” said an officer.“Thanks to these steps since 2019, the G-20 tourism working group conference was held successfully in Srinagar. As many as 4.5 lakh pilgrims participated in Amarnath Yatra in 2023 and Moharram procession was taken out in Srinagar after a gap of 34 years, in which 40,000 persons and J&K LG Manoj Sinha himself took part,” said an MHA officer.","There has been a 69 per cent dip in terror-related incidents and a 67 per cent fall in resulting casualties in Jammu and Kashmir over the past 10 years of Narendra Modi government.

Shiv Sena MP Milind Deora , in his maiden Rajya Sabha speech, said that life has come to a full circle. Former Congress leader who ended his family's 55-year association with the party in January, recalled how Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray supported his father Murli Deora to become the mayor of Mumbai 47 years ago. He mentioned how now after 47 years, the same party has sent him to Rajya Sabha at the age of 47 years.""In many ways, life has come a full circle because in 1977, 47 years ago, late Bala Saheb Thackeray supported my late father become the mayor of Mumbai.And today, 47 years later, at the age of 47, the president of Shiv Sena and Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Eknath Shinde, has enabled me to represent Mumbai and Maharashtra in Rajya Sabha,"" he said. Deora also highlighted the ""four Cs"" which, according to him, were of concern for the country. The four factors outlined by him included: ""China, City and Commuting and Climate Change.""Sir, I am grate that you have given me the time to support the President's address. Sir, I am very fortunate that my maiden speech in this august House responds to the Honorable President's very articulate outlining of the government's plans ahead for the next five years and highlights the government's achievements over the last ten years. Sir, I am also extremely fortunate to have your esteemed presence in the chair during my maiden speech for which I thank you, sir.Sir, before I begin my speech, if you permit, I would like to remember my late father, Mr. Murali Deora. When he passed away, he was at that time a member of this august House and he always taught me to stand up for myself and to keep loyalty for the country before loyalty for the party. Sir, I am sure today he is with me to guide me on this journey, on this new journey I should say, sir, and to bless me.Sir, in many ways, life has come full circle because in 1977, 47 years ago, the late Balasaheb Thackeray supported my late father to become mayor of Mumbai's financial capital, Mumbai. And today, 47 years later, at the age of 47, I am disclosing my age, the president of the Shiv Sena, Mr. Eknath Shindeji, the chief minister of Maharashtra has enabled me to represent Mumbai, Maharashtra and India through the Shiv Sena in the Rajya Sabha. Sir, for the first time in India's history, we have an Adivasi woman President of India. And we have a leader who hails from a very, very humble background.When people say that democracy is under threat, I want to answer them that the fact that an ordinary person who was selling tea on a railway track is now the Prime Minister of the world's largest democracy proves that India's democracy is strong, India's constitution is strong. In Maharashtra too, sir, the chief minister, a very simple auto rickshaw driver, we have auto rickshaws in a certain part of Mumbai, an auto rickshaw driver rose to become the chief minister of the country's second-largest state, the most industrialised state. This means for someone who is young and is watching us today that our democracy is in fact stronger than ever before.Sir, many people, my former colleagues who are not here today, who I am sure when their chance comes to speak and through the public domain have been analyzing the Lok Sabha results in many, many ways. But the fact remains as few people before me have pointed out that Narendra Modi Ji is only the second Indian to be sworn in as Prime Minister of India for three consecutive terms. The first being Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru exactly 62 years ago in 1962.In fact, something which has not been said before me for the sake of not being repetitive, to give this house a sense of how high anti-incumbency levels are around the world and this is due to a variety of factors. There is a growing aspirational demanding voter, social media is playing a role in making people more impatient. Demographic transitions are underway.In the last 10 years alone, Prime Minister Narendra Modi Ji has seen and I will count down, 6 Prime Ministers of Pakistan, 5 Prime Ministers of the UK, 4 Presidents of Sri Lanka, 3 Presidents of the USA, 2 Presidents of France and finally, after Sushma Swaraj Ji, after a decade, one Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha. So Sir, Modi Ji ka abhi bhi poora 5 saal ka karekaal baaki hai aur isi liye main Eknath Shinde Ji ke aur se, Shiv Sena ke aur se, Maharashtra ke aur se, Maananiya Pradhan Mantri Ji ko apne dil ke gherayee se badhai dena chahata hoon, unki Sarkar ke sabhi sadasyon ko bahut bahut shubh kamnaye dena chahata hoon. Sir, chunavi bhaashanon mein, main aksar mazaak mein kaha karta tha ki, yadi aap INDI Alliance se, I hataoge yaani INDIA se, yadi aap I letter ko hataoge, toh aapko NDA dikhai dega.If you remove I from INDIA, you get NDA. My point I am making is that despite all our political differences, I still believe that there is more that unites us than divides us. And a new beginning must call for a starting afresh.I am starting afresh and I believe that as we move from confrontation to collaboration, (6:43) we must replace the letter I with V. Sir, I wish to bring to your attention four Cs, the letter C, that I am sure everyone across this house will agree with me on. And we can rise above politics and agree that these are issues which concern our country. Some will see them as challenges, I personally see them as opportunities.So the first C is China, the second C is cities, the third C is computing and the fourth C is climate change. All of these in varying degrees have been spoken about by the Honourable President. Sir, when we talk of China, the first C, today both the West and the Global South, the developed world and the developing world, have a trade deficit with China.But in addition to a trade deficit, they also have a trust deficit with China. And India in that sense is very, very unique. (8:03) India today enjoys a trust surplus with the rest of the world.Sir, today global investors, global companies are adopting what they call a China plus one strategy. What that essentially means is that for the last 20 or 30 years, most of these companies moved their manufacturing from Western countries to China. They created jobs in China, they strengthened China's economy and as a result today, they are seeing geopolitical tensions in the South China Sea and other parts of the world.Today, those same companies, those same countries, those same investors, are moving investments, diversifying their factories to countries like India, to countries in the neighbourhood, maybe Vietnam and Bangladesh. And as rightly pointed out by the Honourable President of India, Sir, she made a very interesting remark. She said we must enhance cooperative federalism in our country between centre and states but far more importantly, competitive federalism between states.I have always been a firm believer that if states compete aggressively against each other, that is what will make India truly competitive globally. My good friend Jayant Choudharyji is here. I congratulate him, Sir, through you for becoming a minister.I was just telling him now that as a skills minister, as a young minister of skills development, one area that we can focus on is upskilling our workforce. Today, we remain very low in terms of the number of women in our workforce. If we look at our immediate neighbours in South Asia, if we look at our neighbours like Vietnam in Asia, they have a much higher participation of women in our workforce.Having a program where we can upskill women in the workforce will be very, very useful for our country's economy. And now I believe is the time for India leveraging on this China plus one strategy to become a leader not just in South Asia but in all of Asia.And the leader of Asia today as we all know will be the leader and the super power of the world.Sir, second C is cities. My close associate from Maharashtra spoke about urbanization. Many people see urbanization as a challenge.Sir, I am a Rajya Sabha MP from Maharashtra but Mumbai is my birthplace, my birthplace. I have a special place in my heart for Mumbai. And I believe what Mumbai is today, India will be tomorrow.Sir, today when we talk of urbanization, in our country only one-third of Indians or 48 crore Indians live in cities. The rest live in rural areas. Conversely, in a country like China, two-thirds of China lives in cities and one-third lives in rural areas.But the number of Indians living in cities in five or six short years is going to rise from 48 crore people to 59 crore people. Sir, in Mumbai, today the population of Mumbai is 2 crore and in 5 or 6 years, Mumbai's population will become 3 crores. How we take advantage of this urbanization? (12:02) How we plan our cities effectively? This will allow us to reap a demographic dividend.Sir, I certainly invite your esteemed self, sir, to visit Mumbai. I would through this speech invite many of my fellow MPs. In the last few years, massive transformations are underway in the city of Mumbai where we are trying to absorb the influx of people, urbanization from rural to urban areas.And this is very, very critical for our economic growth. Sir, the third C I mentioned is computing. The honourable IT minister was in the house.I was hoping during my speech I would be able to draw his attention in some ways to this issue. But, sir, superpowers of the 19th and 20th century were the countries that dominated the industrial revolution. The countries that become the superpowers of tomorrow, of the 21st century, will become countries that dominate in the area of artificial intelligence.And, sir, every industry has a raw material. Artificial intelligence, which is being discussed on a large scale all over the world, the raw material of artificial intelligence is data. And today, India is going to become the world's largest producer of this raw material.Today, the average Chinese person is consuming 32 GB of data per day. The average Indian is consuming only 24 GB of data per day.But, Mr. Rijiju ji, in the next four years, India will become the largest data consumer in the world.The average Indian will consume 62 GB of data per day. We will be surpassing America, all of Europe, and even China. What does data mean? Data means that whenever we watch a video on WhatsApp, watch a video on YouTube, go to Facebook, Instagram, the data that we are using, the raw material that we are generating in India, that raw material is accruing value in companies in America, in Silicon Valley.I believe, sir, it is time for us to leverage that raw material, to leverage that natural resource, and to build the next Google, to build the next Facebook, to build the next WhatsApp coming right here out of India. That is what can give us superpower status. And that, I believe, is the vision of the Prime Minister under the Digital India Initiative.Sir, the fourth C I mentioned is climate change. Sir, a few days ago, in fact, in Delhi and Noida, it is a pity that due to the heat wave, some people died. Sir, who were these people who died? They were not, unfortunately for them, privileged people like us.They were ragpickers. (15:27) They were manual laborers. They were security guards.Sir, fortunately today in Delhi, I can say that we have brought some good weather from Mumbai. There is some monsoon weather here. But, sir, I am glad that the Honorable President, in her speech, spoke extensively.Mr. Sudhanshu Trivedi, who initiated this debate, he also referred to that point, that the President of India spoke extensively about the greening of India's economy. Sir, the Prime Minister has set a very ambitious target for this country, to become net zero. By the year 2070.Once again, sir, many people will see this as a threat. I see the greening of India's economy as a massive opportunity for us to invest in the industries of the future. Today, sir, India can become a world leader in offshore wind energy.I read today that the government is using production linked incentives that the cabinet approved recently, to incentivize industry to generate electricity through offshore wind. In green hydrogen, the government has a very ambitious plan to build electrolyzers in India. Even with an open mind, we should think of nuclear.Even in a small area, sir, like seaweed cultivation, which I would like to congratulate the Prime Minister once again, that if anyone spearheaded seaweed cultivation in India, it was the Prime Minister when he was the chief minister of Gujarat. And sir, seaweed is the food of the future. The Japanese, sir, as we know, have been eating seaweed for centuries and they have the highest life expectancy.Seaweed is becoming an organic substitute for fertilizers. When it is mixed with fodder, it reduces methane gas emissions from cows and India is a big livestock population considering that we are the biggest dairy consumer and dairy producer. (17:30) My dear friend, Mr. G.K. Vasan is here.Sir, if you go to Tamil Nadu, the entire coast of Rameshwaram, the farmers are growing seaweed in abundance and exporting that. These are small industries which we should think about. Climate change, in my opinion, is an opportunity.Sir, I will give you two small examples. Today, there is a war between Russia and Ukraine in Europe. Almost all of Europe was entirely dependent on Russia for their energy needs.Because of the war, Europe is forced to invest in innovative green technologies of the future. Wind energy, nuclear energy. Similarly, sir, you will recall, in the 70s, when the Arab-Israel war happened, and at that time, the Arab countries decided that they will not export oil to America.America experienced what was called the oil shock. Petrol pumps were empty. Nobody could fill petrol and diesel.That was the first time, under that time's president, Jimmy Carter, when the first investment was made in photovoltaic solar technologies, which gave birth to solar energy. So, sir, every challenge presents, in many ways, an opportunity. Until such time, as India becomes a world leader, creates technologies of the future, I am glad that the government is using production-linked incentive schemes to incentivize and reduce our dependence on the supply chain that is dominated by countries like China, especially in electric vehicles, especially in solar, even going beyond climate change in the areas of semiconductor chips.Sir, semiconductor chips is something now, in every car, on every tablet, on every table of every MP, everything requires that microchip. And Taiwan, small country, has in some ways a monopoly producing almost 95% of the world's chip. I congratulate this government for diversifying from Taiwan and for bringing semiconductor plants in India for the first time.Sir, I said that this is the time to be bold, to be decisive, and for the government to act. For the first time, as I said, in 62 years, there is a third consecutive term government. Sir, I would like to share an interesting example of a neighboring country in Asia, which has many similarities with India and it can be applied in some ways to India.Sir, Singapore. The founding father of Singapore and the first Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, who I have had the pleasure to meet several times. And he was a very good friend of India.He was a well-wisher of India. Sometimes people wonder when they go to Singapore, how did this man, in a short span of time, how did he transform a former British colony, where most of the people lived in slums, there was no healthcare, there was rampant illiteracy, there were ethnic tensions, there were communal riots. Sir, he took three simple but very controversial decisions at the time.I am in no way advocating those decisions for India, but I am just pointing it out when I talk about being bold. His first decision, he said, despite the fact that in Singapore, there were Indians, largely our Tamil brothers and sisters, there were ethnic Chinese, there were Malays, people from Malaysia. e said, I want everyone to speak English, because that is the language of the future and that is what will make Singaporeans employable globally.Second thing he did was, he said, I want to attract the best talent from around the world to come live, work in Singapore and strengthen the economy of Singapore. The third thing he did, which I think everyone will agree with, he said, politicians must be paid salaries equal to the private sector,so that there is no corruption whatsoever. And sir, he achieved honestly nothing short of a miracle.Sir, my limited point, a third consecutive term government is historic, it is a record government, the world is watching India, there are global tailwinds, being from Mumbai, I meet a diverse section of people, people want India to succeed. It is for us to be bold, it is for us to be decisive, it is for us to act very, very aggressively. Sir, before concluding my speech, the reason I am not taking my, sorry, I have already reached 22 minutes, I thought I have not reached.Sir, before concluding my speech, thank you, thank you. Sir, before concluding my speech, I would like to highlight something that the honourable President said about this government's achievement. But I believe that there is one achievement, one achievement, which stands out above all achievements.And I say this as a Mumbaikar. Sir, under this government,) cities like Mumbai, have been completely eradicated of terror attacks during the last decade. Regrettably, this was a regular feature.Sir, I have represented Mumbai, I was the MP of South Mumbai when 26-11 happened. From 2006, there was a train blast. There was 26-11 in 2008.There was the Zaveri Bazaar and the serial blasts in Mumbai.All of this has been eliminated. At that time alone, 400 people died.Sir, I believe national security of our country is paramount. If we want to grow our economy, we want investors to come here, we have to ensure that our national security is protected. Our national security remains stronger than ever.And I congratulate this government for ensuring that, not just in a city like Mumbai, but across the country. Sir, with these words, I didn't realize I have already crossed 24 minutes,but I am extremely grateful to you, sir, for the time and for being present in the chair while I make my maiden remarks. Thank you very much.Thank you.","Former Congress leader Milind Deora ended his family's 55-year association with the party in January.

Around 10.30 am today (local time), a park visitor reported seeing a body in Avalanche Creek below the gorge. Rangers immediately began recovery efforts. Flathead County coroner is working to confirm identity through DNA or dental records.""The search for Patil's body was challenging due to submerged obstacles such as fallen trees and rocks, which limited the rangers' ability to investigate the gorge for weeks because of water depth and whitewater conditions during spring and summer runoff. As the water level dropped, rangers used long poles to search large portions of the gorge but were unable to reach the deepest and most dangerous areas.According to Glacier National Park officials, Patil was hiking with friends above a gorge on the Avalanche Lake Trail on July 6 when he diverted from the trail. While standing on a large rock, he fell into Avalanche Creek. It remains unclear whether he slipped on a wet portion of the rock or lost his balance. Friends and witnesses saw him fall into the creek, go underwater, resurface briefly, and then be swept away by the current into the gorge.""An alert helicopter conducted aerial searches of the creek, and rangers scoured the area on July 6, recovering personal items that had washed downstream. During the past four weeks, ground search efforts have continued from the gorge to the bridge on the Trail of the Cedars,"" added the statement from park officials.Rangers used a drone multiple times to search the gorge. The Trail of the Cedars and Avalanche Lake Trail were temporarily closed during the recovery efforts and reopened around 3:30 pm local time.Park officials extended their condolences to Siddhant Vitthal Patil's family and friends, expressing hope that recovering the body would help bring closure to his loved ones.

Bailey Bridge in Wayanad: All you need to know about the working and specifications of the Bailey Bridge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bailey-bridge-in-wayanad-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-working-and-specifications-of-the-bailey-bridge/articleshow/112282493.cms,"Understanding the Bailey Bridge

How the Bailey Bridge works

Specifications of the Bailey Bridge in Wayanad

On July 30, landslides hit Kerala's Wayanad district, resulting in over 219 deaths and 206 people missing as of August 4. Rescue operations, involving the Indian Army, National Disaster Relief Fund, Navy, and Coast Guard, are being hindered by heavy rainfall. To aid in the relief efforts, a Bailey bridge was built at Chooralmala by the Madras Engineer Group, connecting to Mundakkal village, a heavily impacted area.Despite the severe challenges faced in Wayanad, the deployment of the Bailey bridge by the Indian Army’s Madras Engineer Group has provided vital support. The modular bridge’s rapid assembly and wartime origins make it an essential temporary solution in this crisis, bridging the gap until a more permanent infrastructure can be established.A Bailey bridge is a type of modular bridge that consists of pre-fabricated components, allowing for quick and efficient assembly on-site. Originating during World War II, the Bailey bridge was developed by English civil engineer Donald Coleman Bailey.The bridge components are pre-constructed steel panels connected with large, screw-like pins. These pins are used to build the bridge’s guardrails. Workers then place beams across these guardrails to form the bridge deck, with the beams locking into place securely. The design of the Bailey bridge allows for easy extension and mobility, making it ideal for use in emergencies and wartime scenarios. The components are light and can be transported using trucks, facilitating quick assembly without the need for heavy equipment.The Bailey bridge built in Wayanad is 190 feet long and is crucial for the movement of ambulances and heavy machinery, with a weight capacity of 24 tonnes. It will serve as a temporary solution until a permanent bridge can be constructed.","A Bailey bridge is a type of modular bridge that consists of pre-fabricated components.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive.

Q: How often should I review and update my career cushioning efforts?

Q: How do I know if my career cushioning efforts are working?

Q: How much time should I be dedicating to career cushioning?

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Reaching a new audience

Former President Donald Trump added a gold Rolex watch and a customized Tesla Cybertruck to his collection of luxury items , courtesy of internet celebrity Adin Ross . The gifts were presented during a live-streamed interview at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate on Monday afternoon.The Cybertruck, emblazoned with Trump’s campaign slogan “Make America Great Again” and adorned in red, white, and blue, was parked outside Mar-a-Lago, creating a striking visual for Ross’ audience, which peaked at over 500,000 viewers.The truck featured an image of Trump with his fist raised, taken moments after an assassination attempt at a recent rally.Trump expressed admiration for both the vehicle and the watch, saying, “I think it’s incredible,” and “Wow, that’s so nice,” as he inspected the gifts, reported NYT. The interview also featured a custom playlist, with Trump enjoying classics like the Beach Boys while seated inside the Cybertruck.As per Tesla’s website, a base model Cybertruck has a sticker price of $60,990, with high-end trims topping $100,000. A customized wrap — the printed vinyl sticker covering every exterior surface of the vehicle — starts around $4,000. Rolex watches typically start at $5,000.The extravagant gifts, which far exceed the federal campaign contribution limit of $3,300 per election cycle, could pose legal challenges for Trump. Brendan Fischer, deputy executive director at the watchdog group Documented, indicated that these items likely constitute illegal and excessive campaign contributions.In response, Karoline Leavitt, a Trump campaign spokesperson, stated that the campaign would seek guidance from the Federal Election Commission (FEC) on how to handle the gifts.Beyond the potential legal implications, the interview with Ross is part of Trump’s broader strategy to connect with younger, predominantly male, right-leaning voters who form a significant portion of Ross’ fanbase. Ross, who gained fame through video game streaming, has been a controversial figure due to his association with far-right personalities and his content, which led to multiple sanctions and an eventual ban from Twitch.Trump has increasingly sought to engage this demographic, appearing in interviews with other influencers such as Logan Paul and the Nelk Boys, as well as featuring on platforms like TikTok to reach millions of potential voters.During the nearly 90-minute interview, Ross avoided confrontation, allowing Trump to freely criticize political opponents like Vice President Kamala Harris and President Joe Biden. Ross’ enthusiastic endorsement of Trump during the livestream even caught the former president by surprise, with Trump praising Ross for his open support.","The gifts were presented during a live-streamed interview at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate on Monday afternoon.

He promised to harness these resources to make the US energy-dominant on the world stage.""We have more energy — we have more liquid gold, as I call it, under our feet than Saudi Arabia, than Russia, than anybody,"" Trump was quoted as saying.""We're going to be energy-dominant, we're going to make a fortune, we're going to supply it all over Europe, all over the world,"" Trump said.

Legal: $950 million fine for funeral home fraud: Is this enough for families whose loved ones were left to rot?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/950-million-fine-for-funeral-home-fraud-is-this-enough-for-families-whose-loved-ones-were-left-to-rot/articleshow/112304675.cms,"Emotional fallout and

Legal and legislative repercussions

In a stunning judicial decision, Jon and Carie Hallford , the owners of the Colorado funeral home “Return to Nature,” have been ordered to pay $950 million in damages to the families of victims deceived by their fraudulent practices. This ruling, reported by AP, comes amid the Hallfords' ongoing financial troubles and numerous criminal charges across several states and federal courts.The Hallfords face hundreds of charges, including corpse abuse and theft of $130,000 from families who paid for cremations and burials that were never performed.The $950 million judgment is largely symbolic, reflecting the profound emotional trauma suffered by the families who discovered that the ashes they received were fake, while the actual remains of their loved ones were found decaying in a facility infested with pests.Andrew Swan, the class action attorney representing the victims, expressed frustration over the likely futility of collecting the damages but emphasized the importance of holding the Hallfords accountable. “I’m never going to get a dime from them, so, I don't know, it’s a little frustrating,” said Crystina Page, one of the plaintiffs. Page had entrusted the Hallfords with her son’s remains in 2019 and carried the urn she believed held his ashes until discovering in 2023 that his body was among those found at the funeral home.For Page and many others, the ruling is a small consolation as they grapple with the horror of their loved ones' decaying bodies being mishandled. “If nothing else, this judgment will bring more understanding to the case,” Page said, hoping the case would shed light on the broader impact of the Hallfords' actions.The Hallfords did not attend the civil hearings, with Jon Hallford in custody and Carie Hallford out on bail. Neither has acknowledged the civil case. The lawsuit, which includes over 100 family members, remains open for additional victims, reflecting the scale of the tragedy.The case has spurred Colorado lawmakers to introduce comprehensive regulations for the funeral home industry, addressing previously lax oversight in the state.Jon Hallford is being represented by a public defender’s office, which does not comment on cases, while Carie Hallford’s attorney, Michael Stuzynski, was unavailable for comment.As the legal and emotional fallout continues, the Hallfords’ case stands as a grim reminder of the need for rigorous oversight in the funeral home industry and the devastating impact of their fraudulent actions on grieving families.","Jon and Carie Hallford have been ordered to pay $950 million in damages to families of victims deceived by their fraudulent practices.

A victory for antitrust regulators

The path forward

Implications for the tech industry

US district judge Amit Mehta said that Google's dominant search engine has been unlawfully leveraged to stifle competition and innovation. The decision, which could significantly disrupt the internet landscape, marks one of the most consequential antitrust rulings in recent history.The ruling follows nearly a year of litigation in a trial that pitted the US Justice Department against Google, marking the largest antitrust case in the US in over 25 years.After reviewing extensive evidence and testimony from high-profile executives at Google, Microsoft, and Apple, Judge Mehta issued his 277-page decision three months after final arguments were presented.Judge Mehta's ruling was unequivocal: “Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.” The judge underscored Google's overwhelming control of the search market, citing its 89.2% share of general search services, which soars to 94.9% on mobile devices.This decision delivers a significant blow to Google and its parent company, Alphabet Inc., which has long maintained that its market dominance is a result of consumer preference. Google's search engine processes an estimated 8.5 billion queries daily, nearly doubling its volume over the past decade.Despite the setback, Google plans to appeal the ruling. Kent Walker, Google's president of global affairs, defended the company's practices, saying, “This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn’t be allowed to make it easily available.”For the US Justice Department, the ruling represents a substantial victory in its efforts to curb Big Tech 's power. Attorney General Merrick Garland hailed the decision as “an historic win for the American people,” emphasizing that no company, regardless of size or influence, is above the law.The trial cast Google as a technological bully, using its dominance to extract artificially high prices from advertisers while curbing competition. Prosecutors argued that Google’s monopoly not only hurt competitors but also diminished the quality of its own service by reducing incentives to innovate.Judge Mehta's ruling pointed to Google's billions of dollars spent annually to secure its search engine as the default option on devices as a key factor in maintaining its monopoly. In 2021 alone, Google spent over $26 billion to lock in these agreements.Mehta's conclusion sets the stage for a new legal phase focused on determining the remedies required to restore competition. A hearing is scheduled for September 6 to begin discussing potential measures, which could range from dismantling parts of Google’s operations to banning default search agreements.However, any significant changes are likely to be delayed by a lengthy appeals process, which experts predict could last up to five years. During this time, Google may fend off immediate restrictions, though it could still face class-action lawsuits from advertisers.The ruling also poses potential risks for Apple, which benefits from Google’s payments to make its search engine the default on iPhones. Google reportedly paid Apple around $20 billion in 2022 alone, a figure that has doubled since 2020.This decision could have broader implications for the tech industry, particularly for Microsoft, which has been positioning itself as a counterweight to Google in the search market. If Mehta enforces limits on Google’s default search agreements, it could open up opportunities for Microsoft's Bing, which currently dominates searches on the Microsoft Edge browser.The ruling also reflects the Biden administration's aggressive stance against Big Tech, with the Justice Department pursuing cases against other giants like Apple, Ticketmaster, and even exploring the role of companies like Microsoft, Nvidia, and OpenAI in the burgeoning AI sector.","US district judge Amit Mehta said that Google's dominant search engine has been unlawfully leveraged to stifle competition and innovation.

He often sought her counsel as an external adviser when she was in the Senate.

This issue has been a persistent challenge for the Biden administration, as many Americans voter said that basic necessities such as food, housing, and gasoline have become less affordable.The US economy's resilience has also been called into question following a weaker than expected jobs report last week, which led to a selloff in financial markets on Monday.Despite the criticism, the White House has asserted that the inflation is a global phenomenon with, the chief of staff, Jeff Zients stating that the efforts led by Sperling: ""produced the strongest economy in the world"".Gov.

He mentioned that UAE authorities have raised concerns about inappropriate behavior, including making videos of women in Dubai without their consent.He also pointed out a declining trend in overseas employment for Pakistani workers, attributing this to the lack of skills despite technological advancements and modernisation efforts.Mahmood suggested that countries like Bangladesh serve as a model for Pakistan in terms of skilled labour force and recommended that Pakistan should follow their example.""The governments of the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Kuwait have expressed various concerns regarding overseas Pakistanis,"" Mahmood informed the committee.He also said that the Pakistani diaspora consists of 10.7 million individuals, primarily employed in Saudi Arabia, UAE, the US, UK, and Canada.Another issue brought to light was the presence of organised gangs of Pakistani beggars operating in Iraq and Saudi Arabia, having entered these countries as pilgrims. Mahmood noted that many individuals travel to Saudi Arabia on Umrah visas, with Saudi authorities reporting that 90 percent of beggars arrested in the country are Pakistani.Senator Nasir Abbas raised concerns about Pakistanis living illegally in Iraq and questioned whether the ministry could assist them, as they are often subjected to poor treatment.Senator Zeeshan Khanzada also pointed out that many Pakistanis living illegally in Italy often deny their nationality, while the Pakistani embassy recognises them as citizens.

Coordinators of the recent student protests in Bangladesh have proposed the formation of a new interim government with Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus as its chief adviser. The announcement was made in a video released on Facebook early Tuesday.The Bangladesh army chief Waker-Uz-Zaman is scheduled to meet with the protest leaders at 12 pm local time (0600 GMT) on Tuesday.Muhammad Yunus, born on June 28, 1940, in Chittagong, Bangladesh, is a distinguished social entrepreneur , banker, economist, and civil society leader. He rose to international prominence in 2006 when he and the Grameen Bank received the Nobel Peace Prize for their pioneering work in microcredit and microfinance . These initiatives provide small loans to underserved entrepreneurs, empowering them to achieve economic and social development despite limited access to traditional banking services.In addition to the Nobel Prize, Yunus has been honored with numerous prestigious awards, including the United States Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 2010. He co-founded Yunus Social Business – Global Initiatives (YSB) in 2011, which focuses on promoting social businesses worldwide. YSB supports these enterprises through incubator funds and advisory services, working with various organizations such as companies, governments, foundations, and NGOs.Yunus served as the Chancellor of Glasgow Caledonian University in Scotland from 2012 to 2018 and was previously a professor of economics at Chittagong University. He has also played a significant role in Grameen America and the Grameen Foundation, which continue his efforts in microcredit. From 1998 to 2021, he was a board member of the United Nations Foundation, contributing to a range of UN initiatives.Professor Yunus has an extensive educational background, having studied at Dhaka University in Bangladesh before receiving a Fulbright scholarship to study economics at Vanderbilt University, where he earned his Ph.D. in 1969. He began his academic career as an assistant professor of economics at Middle Tennessee State University and later returned to Bangladesh to head the economics department at Chittagong University.Throughout his career, Yunus has held various influential positions, including serving on the International Advisory Group for the Fourth World Conference on Women (1993-1995), the Global Commission on Women's Health, and the UN Expert Group on Women and Finance. His contributions have been recognized globally, with accolades such as the Mohamed Shabdeen Award for Science, the World Food Prize, the King Hussein Humanitarian Leadership Award, the Volvo Environment Prize, the Nikkei Asia Prize for Regional Growth, the Franklin D. Roosevelt Freedom Award, and the Seoul Peace Prize.In response to the famine in Bangladesh in 1974, Yunus sought to make a tangible difference for the impoverished. He initiated long-term loans to help individuals start their own small businesses, which led to the establishment of the Grameen Bank and the broader movement of microfinance. This innovative approach has helped countless people escape poverty and improve their quality of life.Yunus was sentenced to six months in jail by a court for violating the labour laws in this year's January but later in March he was granted bail.He was also jailed in a USD 2.3 million embezzlement case. The embezzlement case involves a workers welfare fund of Grameen Telecom, which owns 34.2 per cent of the country's largest mobile phone company, Grameenphone, a subsidiary of Norway's telecom giant Telenor.The charges involve the embezzlement of over 250 million takas and money laundering. The accused gave the money to trade union leaders instead of the workers. This way they deprived the ordinary workers of their rightful earnings.",The Bangladesh army chief Waker-Uz-Zaman is scheduled to meet with the protest leaders at 12 pm local time (0600 GMT) on Tuesday.

NEW DELHI: Intelligence establishment sees the hand of Pakistan 's external intelligence agency, ISI and its Chinese patron in escalating the protests and subversion that forced Sheikh Hasina to flee the country.Information reaching here point to the not-so-subtle hand of Islami Chhatra Shibir (ICS), the student wing of hardline Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh which is known for its anti-India stance, in inflaming the streets, and turning protest over quotas into a determined effort to replace Hasina with a regime that is friendly to Pakistan and China and hospitable for the anti-India terror groups which would work out of Bangladesh before the crack down ordered by the ousted Awami League govt.The intelligence inputs alluded to meticulous planning undertaken by ICS members several months prior, aimed at instigating widespread violence across the nation. ""The ISI-backed Jamaat-e-Islami had received substantial financial backing earlier this year to destabilise the Sheikh Hasina govt. A significant portion of this funding is believed to have originated from Chinese entities operating in Pakistan,"" an official disclosed.Although Hasina tried to keep China in good humour, she was sensitive also to India's interests-an even-handendess which was not to China's pleasing.Interestingly, many leading figures of the Islamic student outfit managed to charm the western-affiliated NGOs by using jargon of democracy and rights.The ICS has been under the surveillance of Indian intelligence agencies for an extended period, following the emergence of its active involvement in anti-India activities, including the propagation of a jihadist agenda in Indian territories adjacent to Bangladesh. The ICS also operates in close coordination with the ISI-backed outfit, Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami (HuJI), a Pakistan-based Deobandi terrorist group with an affiliate in Bangladesh. There exists visual evidence of ICS members undergoing training in Afghanistan and Pakistan. ""The ultimate objective of Jamaat or ICS is to establish a Taliban-type govt in Bangladesh, and the ISI has been assuring them of their support in achieving this goal. Their proximity became flagrant in the wake of the strengthening ties between the Indian and Bangladeshi governments,"" an intelligence officer remarked.The support from the China's ministry of state and security is also suspected to have extended a helping hand as Beijing has had been wary of Hasina's 'balancing act' in its dealings with India and China. A govt in Dhaka over which Pakistan has a leverage will surely better serve Beijing's interests better, said an intelligence source.In any case, MSS has lately been more proactive. ""An example of this is a propaganda video recently circulated by the MSS in China, warning of 'foreign spies being everywhere'. This was highly uncharacteristic of the MSS,"" the officer added.",Information reaching here point to the not-so-subtle hand of Islami Chhatra Shibir (ICS) The student wing of hardline Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh is known for its anti-India stance. A significant portion of this funding is believed to have originated from Chinese entities operating in Pakistan.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112298914,imgsize-1113242,width-400,resizemode-4/112298914.jpg"

"Number of Chinese couples getting married falls to 12-year low, data shows",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/number-of-chinese-couples-getting-married-falls-to-12-year-low-data-shows/articleshow/112279372.cms,"HONG KONG : The number of Chinese couples who got married in the first half of this year fell to its lowest level since 2013, official data showed, as more young people deferred nuptials amid a slowing economy and a rise in living costs.The number of marriages in China is closely tied to the number of births, and the decline is likely to upset policymakers trying hard to boost the population , which has been shrinking for two consecutive years.A total of to 3.43 million couples tied the knot in the first six months of the year, a drop of 498,000 from the same year-ago period, the data on marriage registrations showed.Marriage is seen as a prerequisite for having children due to widespread incentives and policies, including a requirement for parents to present a marriage certificate to register their child and receive state benefits. Many young Chinese are opting to stay single or delay getting married due to poor job prospects and worries about the future as growth in the world's second largest economy slows.Marriage rates have been declining in China since 2014. While there was a slight pick up in 2023 due to pent-up demand after the easing of pandemic restrictions, the rate this year is expected to drop to its lowest since 1980, demographic expert He Yafu told state backed newspaper the Global Times.Reasons for the decline in marriage registrations include a decrease in the number of young people, a higher number of males in the marriageable population versus females, the high cost of marriage, and changing attitudes. He said, ""The declining trend in China's birth rate in the long run will be difficult to fundamentally change unless substantial childbirth support policies are implemented in the future to address this challenge.""China's civil affairs university announced a new undergraduate marriage programme to develop marriage-related industries and culture, drawing scorn from social media users who questioned the need for such a course as marriage rates decline.",The number of Chinese couples who got married in the first half of this year fell to its lowest level since 2013.
