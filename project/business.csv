"25-year wait in high court, SC for finality in corruption case",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/25-year-wait-in-high-court-sc-for-finality-in-corruption-case/articleshow/128369165.cms,"NEW DELHI: For decades, the SC has lamented the erosion of public faith in judiciary because of the slow pace of justice delivery, especially for common citizens. This week, it closed a corruption case that had dragged on for nearly 32 years - six years in trial court, 14 years in HC and 11 years in SC, reports Dhananjay Mahapatra.The case related to the alleged siphoning of 400 cement bags meant for the public works division at Aurangabad on March 24, 1994. The trial court convicted the accused six years later on Apr 3, 2000. To concur with the trial court's decision, the Bombay HC took more than 14 years.On appeal, the case remained pending for a decade in the SC before getting listed for final hearing before a bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and R Mahadevan, which reserved the verdict on Aug 21 last year. On Friday, after nearly six months, Justice Mahadevan pronounced the judgment acquitting the accused.Justice Mahadevan said, “Both the trial court and the high court held that the appellants (accused) failed to furnish any satisfactory explanation or documentary justification for such possession (of cement bags). These findings are essentially factual and are supported by the evidence on record.”Despite the evidence against the accused, the bench of Justices Nagarathna and Mahadevan acquitted the accused saying the prosecution charged them under provisions of Essential Commodities Act when on the date of siphoning off cement, it was not a commodity covered under that law.“That said, this was a case where the investigating agency ought to have invoked appropriate provisions of the Indian Penal Code, having regard to the nature of the allegations and the evidence collected,” it said and acquitted the accused saying, “The lapse, therefore, lies squarely at the door of the investigating agency.”","The case related to the alleged siphoning of 400 cement bags meant for the public works division at Aurangabad.

Cabinet OKs India’s 1st underwater road-cum-rail tunnel in Assam,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cabinet-oks-indias-1st-underwater-road-cum-rail-tunnel-in-assam/articleshow/128368829.cms,"PM Modi Opens Kumar Bhaskar Varma Setu, Rs 3000 Crore Bridge Cuts Guwahati Travel Time To 7 Minutes

NEW DELHI: The Union Cabinet has approved infrastructure projects worth over Rs 31,000 crore, including construction of the country’s first road-cum-rail tunnel under the Brahmaputra in Assam. The twin-tube common tunnel with approach roads for movement of vehicles and trains, only the second in the world, would cost Rs 18,662 crore.It will connect Gohpur and Numaligarh in Assam and will cut travel time from about 6 hours to just 20 minutes. The project, to be fully funded by govt, will not just reduce the travel distance from 240 km to roughly 34 km improving connectivity but also has strategic significance, I&B minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said while announcing the Cabinet decision. This four-lane tunnel will ensure high-speed connectivity to Arunachal and provide “strategic resilience” for defence purposes. The minister said the twin tubes would be interconnected at intervals of 500 metres.Officials said the tunnel would be built around 32 metres beneath the Brahmaputra’s lowest bed level. One of the tubes will have provision for a single rail track and no vehicular movement will be allowed when trains run through this tube.PM Modi called the Brahmaputra tunnel project as a “landmark boost to connectivity in the northeast”.In a post on X, he said, “...This transformative project will enhance connectivity, reduce logistics costs and accelerate growth across Assam and the entire Northeast.”TOI has learnt that originally govt had included the connectivity between Gohpur and Numaligarh as a part of the Special Accelerated Road Development Programme for North East in 2008 by constructing a bridge. But later a proposal was mooted to build a road tunnel beneath the Brahmaputra. Later, it was modified to have a common tunnel for both vehicles and trains.A similar 22-km road-cumrail tunnel passing through Chicken Neck corridor in the northeast is also in planning stage. Besides the tunnel, Cabinet approved three NH projects with a combined cost of over Rs 11,000 crore — a 107.7-km fourlane highway in Gujarat, a 154.6-km highway stretch in Maharashtra and an 80-km corridor of NH-167 in Telangana.In rail sector, three multitracking projects covering 12 districts across Delhi, Haryana, Maharashtra and Karnataka were approved at an estimated cost of Rs 18,509 crore. The approved projects will add 389 km to the existing network of railways. Multitracking works are scheduled for completion by March 2031. These include the laying of third and fourth line between Kasara and Manmad in Maharashtra, which will have the second longest tunnel on the rail network.","The twin-tube common tunnel with approach roads for movement of vehicles and trains, only the second in the world, would cost Rs 18,662 crore.

Generative AI ups demand for skilled workers: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/generative-ai-ups-demand-for-skilled-workers-study/articleshow/128368504.cms,"India’s AI Rise Gets Global Push As UN Chief Praises Leadership, Nvidia CEO Predicts Job Surge

NEW DELHI: The introduction of generative AI has resulted in moderation in hiring at the entry level, increased demand for skilled mid-level workers, and provided “considerable stability” at senior level, an ICRIER study has said.“Researchers note this moderation aligns with broader post-pandemic trends in the IT industry and cannot be attributed to AI adoption alone. Roles commonly perceived as most exposed to AI, such as software developers and database administrators, are also among those experiencing the strongest growth in demand, indicating that generative AI is primarily functioning as a productivity-enhancing complement to technical and analytical work, rather than a substitute,” said the report, which was backed by OpenAI and based on a survey of over 650 firms.Roles such as statisticians and mathematicians, application developers and database designers and administrators were among the most exposed — and had the highest demand — while HR, legal and finance professionals were least. The most impacted roles and skills include data entry and clerical work, followed by manual testing, manual quality assurance, and entry level programming.Among business functions in IT companies, software development and engineering, followed by IT infra and cloud services and project management were seen to be the most affected, the survey showed.The report said AI adoption is reshaping hiring priorities toward hybrid skills profiles combining domain expertise and AI and data-related technical skills, instead of narrow specialisation.While half the companies surveyed said they were investing in internal awareness and workforce reskilling, the report said: “The cause for concern, however, is that IT firms are not hiring enough workers with skills in large language model operations or expanding their R&D divisions, and, most importantly, are not investing adequately in training and upskilling. The shortage of qualified AI trainers, limited AI skills among new labour market entrants, and policy and regulatory uncertainty surrounding AI are challenges that must be urgently addressed. ”","The introduction of generative AI has resulted in moderation in hiring at the entry level, increased demand for skilled mid-level workers.

Why stock market crashed today: Top 5 reasons

IT sector stocks crash

Weak global equity markets

Dollar strength, weak rupee

Weak technical set-up

Geopolitical tensions linger

Stock market crash today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the equity benchmarks, crashed in trade on Friday amid weak global cues and the continued IT stocks selloff. While Nifty50 went below 25,500, BSE Sensex closed down over 1,000 points. Nifty50 ended the day at 25,471.10, down 336 points or 1.30%. BSE Sensex closed at 82,626.76, down 1,048 points or 1.25%.The stock market slide was led by continued selloff in IT shares which weighed heavily on market sentiment amid rising concerns about disruption driven by artificial intelligence. Large-cap technology stocks such as Infosys, TCS, HCLTech and Wipro led the losses.Selling pressure in IT stocks intensified for a second straight session after the American depositary receipts of Infosys and Wipro dropped nearly 10 percent overnight. During Friday’s trading, the Nifty IT index fell more than 4 percent, taking its two-day decline close to 10 percent. Major sector players including TCS, Infosys, Wipro, Tech Mahindra, HCLTech and Mphasis declined between 4 and 6 percent, indicating widespread weakness across the segment.Negative sentiment strengthened after US-based artificial intelligence startup Anthropic introduced a new enterprise-oriented tool designed for corporate legal teams.The company, known for its Claude chatbot, said that the platform can automate several tasks such as contract reviews, non-disclosure agreement sorting, compliance processes, preparation of legal briefs and standardised responses. This development has raised concerns about the long-term demand outlook for traditional IT services.“Tech stocks, reeling under the Anthropic shock, are unlikely to recover soon,” warned V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments Limited. He added that Indian IT may continue to face pressure in the near term, while a rotation of capital toward stronger-performing sectors could support stocks outside the technology space.Global market sentiment remained fragile after sharp losses on Wall Street on Thursday, driven largely by heavy selling in technology stocks. Investors turned cautious amid growing concerns that artificial intelligence could disrupt earnings visibility and compress margins across the sector.The Nasdaq, which has a high concentration of technology companies, fell around 2 percent, while broader US indices also declined as market participants evaluated fresh labour market data and positioned themselves ahead of the closely monitored January inflation figures. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 669.42 points, or 1.34 percent, closing at 49,451.98. The S&P 500 slipped 108.71 points, or 1.57 percent, to 6,832.76, and the Nasdaq Composite declined 469.32 points, or 2.03 percent, ending at 22,597.15.Asian equities mirrored the weakness on Friday, pulling back from recent record levels as concerns over profitability pressures in the technology sector weighed on major stocks such as AppleA stronger US dollar, which extended gains for a third consecutive session to 96.93, along with a softer rupee, added to market pressure.The Nifty closed in negative territory on Thursday, slipping out of its recent consolidation range and forming a short-term pattern of lower highs and lower lows. The 26,000 level continues to act as a significant resistance zone, supported by strong call writing activity and multiple failed attempts to move higher.Ongoing geopolitical uncertainty in the Middle East has continued to weigh on investor sentiment after Donald Trump warned that the United States could consider action against Iran if negotiations over a nuclear agreement fail, even as diplomatic efforts remain underway. Adding to market unease, Trump indicated that deploying an additional aircraft carrier to the region is under consideration as Washington and Tehran prepare to restart discussions.","Nifty50 and BSE Sensex crashed in trade on Friday amid weak global cues and the continued IT stocks selloff.

NEW DELHI: The Indian Navy is gearing up to mark a defining moment in India's maritime story as Visakhapatnam will host both the International Fleet Review (IFR) and Exercise MILAN from Feb 15 to 25, placing the 'City of Destiny' once again at the heart of India's Indo-Pacific strategy.“The current edition of IFR and MILAN exercise will be larger in scope and deeper in meaning as navies of 72 countries, including US and Russia, will participate and the mega joint naval events will feature over 60 warships and naval aircraft of three countries,” said a Navy source. The IFR will position India’s eastern seaboard as a focal point for naval diplomacy and multilateral maritime engagement. Warships and assets from Germany, Philippines, and UAE are participating for the first time, including the Philippines' ‘BRP Miguel Malvar’ (FFG-06) and a UAE Navy warship, Al Emarat. Since 2001, India has used IFRs and opened its ports to allied navies to project maritime strength, foster international cooperation, and establish its role in blue water operations.The star of Operation Sindoor’s naval leg, aircraft carrier INS Vikrant, is all set to be the centre of attraction at the fleet review. The Vikrant carrier battle group deployed in the northern Arabian Sea, played a key role in the strategy of compellence, thereby forcing the Pakistan Navy to be in a defensive posture and requesting an urgent ceasefire.For the IFR, it will sail to the Bay of Bengal. China and Turkey have not been invited for the event and the decision is reportedly linked to their military support to Pakistan during last year’s conflict in May.President Droupadi Murmu, Governor S Abdul Nazeer and Andhra Pradesh CM N Chandrababu Naidu will attend the IFR on Feb 18, while defence minister Rajnath Singh will participate in Milan-2026 on Feb 19.MILAN 26 will bring together navies from friendly foreign countries to strengthen professional bonds, share best practices and enhance cooperation at sea. Milan’s sea and harbour phases will focus on interoperability, maritime domain awareness, anti-submarine warfare, air defence, and search-and-rescue operations.Significantly, the IFR will coincide with the Indian Ocean Naval Symposium's conclave of chiefs, showcasing India's convening power in a contested region. Beyond the warships at sea, the International City Parade will carry naval camaraderie into the streets, while a high-level maritime seminar will sharpen the intellectual edge of the gathering. These events promise to elevate IFR and MILAN 2026 beyond ritual, transforming them into platforms for strategic dialogue, operational trust and enduring people-to-people engagement.Technology will feature prominently at IFR 2026, but with a clear lesson: technology amplifies capacity, but governance shapes effects. Drones, autonomous surface and subsurface vehicles, and AI-enabled maritime domain awareness tools can multiply the reach of a modest fleet.The fleet review is a time-honoured naval tradition that assembles ships and sailors from friendly foreign navies, serving as a platform for confidence-building, mutual respect, and operational familiarity.end","Visakhapatnam will host both the International Fleet Review (IFR) and Exercise MILAN from Feb 15 to 25.

Consumer forums can’t be sinecures for retired judges: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/consumer-forums-cant-be-sinecures-for-retd-judges-sc/articleshow/128363327.cms,"‘Justice Delayed Is Justice Destroyed’: CJI Kant Calls High Courts Key Guardians Of Citizens’ Rights

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has taken exception to district and state consumer forums fast becoming sinecures for retired district and HC judges and admitted that the apex court had passed sweeping orders in the past for activating these forums without realising the pendency of cases in these institutions.A district consumer forum is headed by a retired district judge, and a state consumer disputes redressal commission (SCDRC) is headed by a retired HC judge. Most northeastern states and Union territories have complained that there is little work for the commissions and setting them up in full strength will be a drain on the exchequer.Arunachal Pradesh informed a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi on Feb 11 that it has a total of 59 consumer cases pending in district and state consumer forums. It said that it has advertised for post of president of the state consumer forum, but no retired judge is interested in taking up the assignment.A similar story emerged from other northeastern states and UTs. Sikkim has a total pendency of 64 consumer cases — 52 in district forums and 12 in state forum; Mizoram has 82 cases in district forums and 12 in state forum; Manipur has 123 cases in district forums and 43 in state forum; Lakshadweep has a total of 10 cases; Andaman and Nicobar islands has 37 cases in district forum and four in state forum; and Goa has a total pendency of 39 consumer cases.The bench agreed that creating separate district and state forums in states where pendency of consumer cases is low casts an unnecessary burden on the exchequer and the assignment becomes a sinecure for retired judicial officers and retired HC judges.Reflecting on past orders on the issue by SC, the CJI-led bench said, “We are also fond of issuing sweeping directions without realising the ground realities. The presidents of district consumer forums are on a par with district judges but look at the workload of the two. The district judges are overburdened whereas the consumer forums in these states have no work. Why should the president of a district forum be equated with a district judge?”Seeking data from all states on pendency of cases before district forums, the bench decided to deal with the state commissions in seven states/UTs where pendency is low and transferred the pending cases to the HCs concerned.It said the HC chief justice would assign consumer forum work to one of the judges, who would act as president of the forum and hear the cases along with members of the state forum. Those aggrieved by their orders could file an appeal before National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC), the bench said. “States and UTs where pendency of consumer cases are less than 1,000 can submit an alternative proposal for the purpose of providing a mechanism to redress grievances of consumer complaints,” the bench said as some states wanted to appoint part-time members to district consumer forums.",District and state consumer forums fast becoming sinecures for retired district and HC judges.

NEW DELHI: Ahead of next week’s AI Impact Summit, Union information technology minister Ashwini Vaishnaw on Saturday said that investments in the infrastructure layer of artificial intelligence may top $200 billion with commitments of around $90 billion already received.“We are working on all five layers of the AI stack. Conventionally, our strength has been providing IT services. Now, we have to convert this into providing AI-based services. The IT industry too has worked in recent years on this changing business model. It has invested in creating new tools and reskilling their workforce, so they can provide AI services,” Vaishnaw said, while addressing the ET NOW Global Business Summit.He added that after the UK, South Korea and France, India is set to host the biggest AI Impact summit next week, with more than 20 Heads of State and govts attending the event.“At the summit, we will be launching our bouquet of sovereign models. On so many parameters, the models are better than Open AI, Gemini Pro and Deep Seek, giving us confidence that India can develop models on very frugal resources,” said the minister, who is also in charge of railways and information and broadcasting ministries.Highlighting the development in the third layer of AI stack, Vaishnaw stressed that progress in semiconductor development — the “chip layer” — had been significant, with startups and research teams developing cutting-edge solutions that are expected to bear fruit in the coming years.Vaishnaw also noted electronic goods will be among the top two exported goods soon.“One of the key things Europeans wanted from India was electronic goods in the FTA. They wanted electronic items of all kinds for their industry and consumers, because we are a trusted country. India will become a trusted partner in the semiconductor and electronics value chain,” Vaishnaw said.The minister said AI is set to outpace all previous industrial revolutions and technological shifts, necessitating the need for industry and society to remain prepared for this swift transformation, as India’s coordinated push across talent, models, chips and applications will help position the country at the forefront of the global AI revolution.Sharing the progress on the first bullet train project , Vaishnaw said that the first section between Mumbai and Ahmedabad will open in 2027. He also said that the proposed Bengaluru–Chennai corridor could reduce travel time to just 73 minutes, thus bringing the two cities much closer and boosting economic activity.“Our engineers have really lived up to the challenge. Our industry too has gone through that learning curve and is practically self-sufficient in the entire high speed train technology. That is why Prime Minister Modi has announced seven new bullet train corridors, which will connect large parts of the country and transform the entire transportation industry. We are also going to standardise the entire system so that anyone in the world can come and participate. We will have a large role for the industry as well,” he added.On wider railway reforms, Vaishnaw said the ministry is working on “52 reforms in 52 weeks” in 2026, with two new reforms slated to be announced on the same day. Seven reforms have already been implemented and the rest are in progress.“These changes aim to improve overall travel experience, especially for daily passengers belonging to the low- and middle-income families. They remain our most important customers in the railways. We have been able to reduce accidents by about 90%. We want to further reduce it,” he said.","Union information technology minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said investments in the infrastructure layer of artificial intelligence may top $200 billion.

94.5% kids survive after cancer treatment: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/94-5-kids-survive-after-cancer-treatment-study/articleshow/128361861.cms,"NEW DELHI: For thousands of families across India, the words ""cancer-free"" mark relief and new beginnings. But what happens after treatment ends has, until now, remained largely undocumented in the country.On the eve of International Childhood Cancer Day, researchers released findings from India's first large, national childhood cancer survivorship programme, tracking more than 5,400 children who completed treatment across 20 centres, including in Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata and Bengaluru.Launched in 2016 by Indian Paediatric Haematology Oncology Group, the Indian Childhood Cancer Survivorship study is published in 'The Lancet Regional Health - Southeast Asia'. Lead author Dr Rachna Seth, chief of the oncology division in the department of paediatrics at AIIMS, New Delhi, said the idea was conceptualised in 2014 and became operational by 2016. The analysis includes data from 2016 to 2024.""For years, the focus was only on acute care - that children should survive,"" she said. ""But now we know many do survive, and they have decades of life ahead of them. What matters next is how they live after treatment.""The early findings are encouraging. The five-year overall survival rate stands at 94.5%, while event-free survival is at 89.9%. Two years after treatment, the survival rate rises to 98.2%. As of Dec 2024, follow-up data was available for 5,140 children, with 92% alive and in remission.Leukaemia accounted for 41% of cases, making it the most common diagnosis in the cohort. Hodgkin lymphoma, bone tumours and retinoblastoma were also among the leading cancers treated. Nearly all children received chemotherapy, about one in four underwent radiotherapy, nearly one-third required surgery and more than half needed blood transfusions.Seth said survivors may face long-term medical and psychosocial challenges, including fertility concerns, cardiac dysfunction, cognitive issues, relapse and second cancers. ""These late effects need to be systematically captured. Until now, we were largely extrapolating from Western data. India had none,"" she said.While the published analysis covers 20 centres, nearly 35 to 36 centres are now contributing data. ""This gives us our own baseline,"" Seth said.The median follow-up period so far is 3.9 years from diagnosis. About 5.7% experienced relapse and 4.9% died during follow-up.","Researchers release findings from India's first large, national childhood cancer survivorship programme.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday told music composer A R Rahman to show respect to and acknowledge Junior Dagar Bandhu’s contributions to the Dhrupad tradition of Indian classical music. Their heir has accu-sed Rahman of copyright infringement.Ustad Faiyaz Wasifuddin Dagar filed a suit seeking to bar Rahman from using ‘Shiva Stuti’, which he clai-med was originally composed by Ustad Faiyazuddin Dagar and his brother Zahiruddin Dagar, in ‘Veera Raja Veera’. He said he still held copyright over the composition by his father and his uncle.The plaintiff had said credit should be given to the Dagar Brothers when the ‘Veera Raja Veera’ version was played across all modes and mediums, including digital, internet, OTT platforms, satellite, cable television, etc.Delhi HC’s Justice Pratibha Singh had asked the existing credit line ‘Composition based on a Dagarvani Tradition Dhrupad’ be replaced with ‘Composition based on Shiva Stuti by Late Ustad Faiyazuddin Dagar, Late Ustad Zahiruddin Dagar’.The four defendants, including Rahman, were asked to deposit Rs 2 crore each, subject to outcome of the suit. A division bench of the HC had set aside the interim directions — change of credit and Rs 2 crore deposit — saying Dagar had failed to establish prima facie proof of authorship or originality of ‘Shiva Stuti’.An SC bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi told Rahman’s counsel, A M Singhvi, that the plaintiff has made out a case with regard to the originality of the composition but the issue of authorship would be examined.Both the CJI and Justice Bagchi were unequivocal about the immense contributions made by Dagar Bandhu to Indian classical music and said, “Without their and other exponents’ contributions, do you think modern singers would have survived?” SC told Singhvi “instead of going into legal niceties, you could give some respect to them.

'Victory is not declared by mere rhetoric': CDS Gen Anil Chauhan takes swipe at Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/victory-is-not-declared-by-mere-rhetoric-cds-gen-anil-chauhan-takes-swipe-at-pakistan/articleshow/128348950.cms,"General Anil Chauhan (File photo)

CDS General Anil Chauhan Links History With Border Disputes With China, Recalls Nehru Knew About It

NEW DELHI: Chief of defence staff General Anil Chauhan on Saturday took a swipe at neighbouring Pakistan while referring to Operation Sindoor , saying “victory is not declared by mere rhetoric.” He made the remarks while reflecting on India’s defence preparedness and stressing the need to strengthen national security systems. He also said that a sense of victory cannot be built on “dysfunctional air defence systems.”Speaking at the opening session of the ‘JAI Se Vijay’ seminar in Pune, Gen Chauhan referred to India’s success in Operation Sindoor and emphasised that “actual vijay lies in demonstrated evidence.” He said India must carry out a “sober assessment” of its defence systems to prepare for present and future challenges.Without directly naming Pakistan, the CDS highlighted the damage it suffered during India’s counterterror operation in May, launched after Pakistan-sponsored Pahalgam terror attack in April 2025.“With respect to the defence forces, victory is not declared by mere rhetoric. As some entities in our neighbourhood have done so, but demonstrated through evidence, like what we showcased during Operation Sindoor. A sense of victory cannot be built on demolished terror infrastructure, damaged runways, crippled airfields, and dysfunctional air defence systems. Such kinds of victories or slogans do not endure.Actual Vijay lies in demonstrated evidence rather than verifiable outcomes...,” the CDS said.Highlighting future risks, General Chauhan said India’s defence posture over the next decade must be based on a realistic evaluation of emerging threats.“Why this is important is because currently, India's defence posture for the next decade is required to be shaped by a sober assessment of what lies ahead, what kind of challenges lie ahead. And I believe it's increasingly becoming very competitive, confrontational, combative, fragile, and technologically very disruptive,” he added.He also said that in today’s changing global environment, countries can no longer assume permanent friendships or rivalries, and India must be ready to act independently if needed.“Assumptions about permanent friends or adversaries are increasingly becoming unreliable. In today's world, it is difficult to define who your friends are, who your allies are, who your enemies are and who your adversaries are. India must therefore be prepared mentally, structurally and materially to act independently when required,” he said.The CDS said partnerships remain important but cannot replace India’s own capabilities or freedom to make independent decisions. He stressed the need to strengthen domestic defence capacity to ensure strategic autonomy.Explaining the theme ‘JAI Se Vijay,’ Gen Chauhan said that in modern warfare, victory cannot be based on rhetoric or symbolic claims but must rest on “demonstrated evidence and verifiable outcomes.” He warned that damaging infrastructure or airfields alone does not guarantee lasting victory.Referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s idea of JAI -- which stands for Jointness, Aatmanirbharta and Innovation -- Gen Chauhan said it reflects freedom from foreign dependence and outdated thinking. “It is not just victory over an adversary, but equally victory over inertia, prejudices, and institutional comfort,” he said.",Chief of defence staff General Anil Chauhan took a swipe at neighbouring Pakistan.

India aims to reset AI debate with 1st Global South summit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-aims-to-reset-ai-debate-with-1st-global-south-summit/articleshow/128368389.cms,"'Biggest AI Summit': Ashwini Vaishnaw Says India AI Impact Summit Getting 'Phenomenal Response'

Nvidia CEO unable to attend AI Summit



Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ,who was to be one of the biggest attractions at the India AI Impact Summit starting on Monday, will not be able to travel to India for the event. The company issued astatement Saturday, ascribing it to “unforeseen circumstances”. Huang was expected to play a prominent role at the summit — set to be inaugurated by PM Modi.



Nvidia is the world’s most valuable company, with a market capitalisation of $4.4 trillion, thanks to its processors that have become indispensable to the training of AI models. Persons familiar with the development told TOI that Huang is under the weather. Nvidia said a senior delegation led by executive vice-president Jay Puri will attend the event to “celebrate India’s exceptional AI researchers, startups, developers, and partners building country’s AI infrastructure.” TNN





New Delhi : Unthinkable just a few years ago, when artificial intelligence was a shiny experiment — impressive demos, niche tools, and a buzzword that rarely touched daily life — today it sits at the heart of how jobs are created, services delivered, science conducted and societies governed. As the world grapples with both its promise and its risks, India is stepping into a new role, as not just a user of AI but also as a global agenda-setter, becoming the the first developing country and the first nation from the Global South to convene a global AI summit.Speaking exclusively to TOI , Abhishek Singh, CEO of India AI Mission and AI Impact Summit, believes that this is India’s attempt to pull the global AI debate away from elite labs and corporate boardrooms and anchor it in people, inclusion and real-world outcomes.“This is the first summit of its kind and scale being hosted in the Global South,” said Singh, adding, “AI today is largely controlled by a few countries and a few companies. India wants to bring the perspective of the Global South and ensure that AI is more inclusive and democratised.”India’s case for hosting the summit, Singh said, rests on experience rather than theory. Over the past decade, platforms such as Aadhaar, UPI, DigiLocker and telemedicine have shown how digital systems can operate at population scale, delivering services to hundreds of millions.“India has shown its ability to adopt technology for public services,” said Singh, “We want to showcase India’s strength in building AI applications at population scale and also be the voice of the Global South.”The summit comes at a time when govts worldwide are struggling to balance rapid AI innovation with growing concerns over deepfakes, misinformation, bias and misuse. While there is broad agreement that AI should drive economic growth and social good, Singh said translating principles into practice remains uneven.“Every country agrees on two things: AI must be used for larger social good; and harm from AI must be restricted,” he said. “But countries are at very different levels of technological development. That is where regulatory capacity and shared frameworks become important.” India’s approach, he explained, is based on what it calls a ‘techno-legal framework,’ combining legal safeguards with technological tools. Legal provisions require harmful content to be taken down within defined timelines and mandate labelling of AI-generated content, especially where it poses risks to individuals, public order or national security. Alongside this, India is developing tools to detect deepfakes, mitigate bias and create ethical AI certification systems.A major focus of the summit is human capital. As automation reshapes work and threatens traditional livelihoods, the summit aims to push global cooperation on reskilling and workforce transitions, particularly for developing economies facing resource constraints.“AI should not grow only in tech hubs,” Singh said. “We are setting up data labs across the country, centres of excellence in states and smaller cities, and running large-scale skilling and training programmes so that AI reaches tier-2 and tier-3 cities.” Inclusion is another central theme, with India highlighting the role of Indian-language and voicebased AI systems in expanding access. Platforms built on natural language processing and generative AI allow people to access services in their own languages, especially those uncomfortable with English.The summit’s agenda also spans AI-enabled scientific research in healthcare, agriculture and climate, while pushing for openness, reproducibility and shared standards.","Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang will not be able to travel to India for the event.

Jaishankar on Russia ties: Firmly wedded to strategic autonomy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jaishankar-on-russia-ties-firmly-wedded-to-strategic-autonomy/articleshow/128368198.cms,"'Gave Fundamental Confidence': Jaishankar Cites Nuclear Tests, Stresses Strategic Autonomy

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Saturday said India remains firmly committed to strategic autonomy, even as the global energy markets evolve and partnerships shift. He was responding to a question at the Munich Security Conference whether a recent trade agreement with the US would affect New Delhi’s energy ties with Russia and if India was finding it difficult to exercise its strategic autonomy in the current circumstances.India maintains its energy policy is driven by national interests and the actual crude sourcing is done by oil companies taking into account pricing, reliability and other market conditions.“We are very much wedded to strategic autonomy because it’s a part of our history and our evolution. It’s something which is very deep, and something which cuts across the political spectrum as well,” he said.Addressing concerns over energy sourcing, the EAM described the global oil market as complex and dynamic, stressing that commercial considerations guide procurement decisions.“As for energy issues, this is a complex market today. Oil companies in India, as in Europe, as probably in other parts of the world, look at availability, look at costs, look at risks and take the decisions that they feel are in their best interest,” he noted.Jaishankar said that in a rapidly changing global environment, countries continuously reassess their calculations and partnerships.“So many things are changing, and so many of us are doing our calculations and recalculations,” he said, adding while India may not agree with all partners on every issue, dialogue and a willingness to find common ground remain important.“We would not necessarily agree on everything but I do believe that by doing that, and if there is an inclination to find common ground and overlaps, that would happen,” he said.Noting India’s independent decision-making, he said, “If the bottom line of your question is would I remain independent-minded and make my decisions? And would I make choices which sometimes may not agree with your thinking or somebody else’s thinking, yes, it can happen.”He met with G7 foreign ministers and their global counterparts at the Munich Security Conference 2026, reiterating India’s support for the UN80 agenda and underscoring New Delhi’s role in safeguarding global security.Jaishankar also stressed on India’s role in safeguarding sea lines of communication, acting as a first responder in crises, strengthening port security and contributing to resilient submarine cable infrastructure.","India maintains its energy policy is driven by national interests and the actual crude sourcing is done by oil companies. “We are very much wedded to strategic autonomy because it’s a part of our history and our evolution,” Jaishankar said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128368306,imgsize-64712,width-400,resizemode-4/s-jaishankar.jpg"

The ministry's format for publishing these reports also specifies providing details such as actual execution status of refund, possession and compensation orders as well as recovery warrant execution details with values and list of defaulting builders.FPCE said annual report data is not only vital for homebuyers to assess system credibility, but is equally necessary for both state and central govts to frame effective policies, design incentivisation schemes, and develop tax policy frameworks.""Unless we have credible data proving that after Rera the real estate sector has improved in terms of delivery, fairness, and keeping its promises, we are merely firing in the air,"" said FPCE president Abhay Upadhyay, who is also a member of the govt's Central Advisory Council on Rera.As per details shared by the entity, seven states - Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Goa - have never published a single annual report since Rera's implementation, and nine states, including Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Telangana, which initially published reports, have discontinued the practice.Upadhyay said when regulators themselves don't follow the law, they lose the legal right to demand compliance from other stakeholders.

Amit Shah Confident BJP Will Form Government In Kerala In 2026, Vote Share Climbing

(With ANI inputs)

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Saturday accused Congress leader V Narayanasamy of turning Puducherry into an “ATM for the Gandhi family” during his tenure as chief minister of the poll-bound Union territory.The senior BJP leader also alleged that the Narayanasamy administration “sold” PG and diploma seats, including those for reserved category candidates, to “wealthy individuals.”Narayanasamy served as chief minister from June 2016 to February 2021.“Narayanasamy’s government had turned Puducherry into an ATM for the Gandhi family. They openly auctioned PG and diploma seats and even sold the reserved seats for SC and ST to wealthy individuals for the sake of money. Transport mafias were given free rein to trouble the public,” Shah said at a public meeting in Puducherry’s Karaikal.The former BJP president added that Congress leader’s tenure as chief minister was marked by “corruption and chaos,” which the BJP — part of the All India NR Congress-led incumbent government — has worked to eliminate.He further asserted that the saffron party’s focus is now on transforming Puducherry into a developed Union territory over the next five years.“For five years, the Congress government created an environment of corruption and chaos here. In five years, we eliminated corruption and transformed chaos into order, and now it is time to transform Puducherry into a developed Puducherry in the next five years. Earlier, the decisions regarding Puducherry were taken by the Gandhi family in Delhi; now the decisions regarding Puducherry are being taken by Puducherry itself,” Shah told the gathering.Noting that the BJP-All India NR Congress alliance secured 44% of the vote in the 2021 Puducherry assembly elections, he set a target of 60% for the upcoming polls, expected in April.“PM Narendra Modi has worked to make India prosperous as well as secure.

The guidelines direct them to prioritise institutions in underserved and rural areas and focus on key broad specialities while proposing new seats.Alongside seat expansion, regulatory reforms have been introduced to ease growth.The National Medical Commission has notified updated education and faculty regulations, widened eligibility norms for teachers and recognised more hospitals as teaching institutions to support expansion.The Centre said the measures are aimed at increasing access to medical education, improving regional equity and strengthening the country’s healthcare workforce pipeline.With demand for medical seats far outstripping availability each year, the addition of over 10,000 seats is expected to significantly impact admission capacity in the coming academic cycles.","The expansion will be implemented from 2025-26 to 2028-29. 5,000 additional postgraduate seats will be created to address specialist shortages.

New pills offer hope against gonorrhoea as drug resistance tightens grip,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/new-pills-offer-hope-against-gonorrhoea-as-drug-resistance-tightens-grip/articleshow/128337443.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: After decades of losing ground to drug resistance, doctors finally have new weapons against gonorrhoea, a common sexually transmitted infection that has steadily outsmarted one antibiotic after another. The recent approval of two new oral medicines by the US Food and Drug Administration has reopened a narrowing treatment window for a disease edging dangerously close to becoming untreatable.The FDA cleared zoliflodacin (Nuzolvence) and gepotidacin (Blujepa) in December 2025 for treating uncomplicated gonorrhoea. Their arrival comes at a critical time, especially for countries like India, where ceftriaxone is the only effective antibiotic left in routine use.“Gonorrhoea is a major STD and resistance is rising fast,” said Dr Kabir Sardana, head of dermatology at Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital. He attributed the trend largely to antibiotic misuse by general practitioners and quacks. “Azithromycin, once a first-line drug, is now largely ineffective because it was prescribed indiscriminately for everything from minor infections to acne,” he said.Experts say the urgency is reflected in global surveillance.Dr Neirita Hazarika, professor and head of dermatology at AIIMS Guwahati, pointed out that the WHO’s 2025 Global Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance Report has classified drug-resistant gonorrhoea as a high-priority pathogen. She said the approval of the two new oral drugs marks a significant milestone, as clinical trials have shown cure rates comparable to current standard therapy. “These drugs expand treatment options for uncomplicated gonorrhoea at a time when resistance to cephalosporins (Ceftriaxone) and macrolides (Azithromycin) is rising,” she said.Ceftriaxone, now the last dependable option in India, is itself under pressure. Widely used for several other infections, it faces a real risk of resistance if misuse continues. “If ceftriaxone fails, we will be left with virtually no antibiotics for gonorrhoea,” Dr Sardana warned.Gonorrhoea affects both men and women and commonly causes urethritis, but untreated infection can lead to infertility, pelvic inflammatory disease and increased HIV risk. With India already carrying a high burden of sexually transmitted infections, doctors warn that failure of existing drugs would have serious public health consequences.The infection has a long history of defeating antibiotics. Sulfa drugs, penicillin, tetracycline, quinolones and cefixime were all abandoned over time as resistance emerged. By 2007, quinolones were dropped entirely due to widespread failure.Experts say the new drugs are promising but require careful use. Prof Seema Sood of AIIMS New Delhi said zoliflodacin and gepotidacin have shown strong activity in studies for uncomplicated urogenital infection.India’s wider antimicrobial resistance crisis adds urgency. ICMR surveillance has flagged rising resistance linked to over-the-counter antibiotic use. Prof Bimal Kumar Das, HOD of microbiology at AIIMS New Delhi, said newer antibiotics are crucial to tackle AMR, while Dr Hitender Gautam noted that early access in India could help curb resistant infections, with gepotidacin showing potential beyond gonorrhoea.","The FDA cleared zoliflodacin and gepotidacin in December 2025 for treating uncomplicated gonorrhoea.

Raja Ravi Varma’s ‘last’ painting caught in ugly ownership row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/raja-ravi-varmas-last-painting-caught-in-ugly-ownership-row/articleshow/128334362.cms,"‘Imminent risk of painting being transferred to gallery in Australia’

NEW DELHI : A rare Raja Ravi Varma painting — by some accounts his last work — is at the centre of a high-stakes legal battle with multiple ownership claims.The painting, ‘Kadambari’, by the 19th-century maestro, is at present in the possession of Kiran Nadar Museum of Art, which assured Delhi high court recently that it is only exhibiting the artefact, being a private museum, and is not going to sell it further.The piece of art, estimated to be worth well over Rs 100 crore, was originally in possession of a Delhi-based art collector, who moved HC alleging that he was “conned” by his close associates into handing it over to them and lost out on a work of immense emotional and cultural value to the country. The associates, he said, sold the painting.In his suit, art collector Mohinder Verma alleged that in 2021 he entrusted the masterpiece to individuals he considered trusted associates, as one of them was also a director in Verma’s company. However, they first tricked him into accepting advance payment of Rs 3 crore in pounds sterling in London, then tipped off local police, resulting in him being jailed abroad.Taking advantage of his incarceration, the people he entrusted with the painting for safekeeping and restoration, with the explicit understanding that no further action could be taken without his express approval, sold the artwork through a web of intermediaries.The suit claimed the painting ended up at a public auction conducted by Saffronart, where the work was acquired by the Kiran Nadar Museum of Art (KNMA) for a substantial sum — all while the original owner remained entirely in the dark.Meanwhile, UK police dropped charges against Verma and he was acquitted. On returning to India, he lodged a complaint with Delhi Police against his associates, resulting in an FIR and a probe.While hearing the suit, Justice Mini Pushkarna asked the parties to first pursue pre-litigation mediation. During the hearing, the defendants told court that Verma’s brother and sister-in-law should also be made party to the suit, as ownership of the painting was being claimed by them.HC agreed and said it is “of the view that the brother and sister-in-law of the plaintiff ought to be before this court”. It asked the duo to also appear before the mediation wing with the other parties.In his suit, Verma explained why he rushed to court, claiming he recently learned that the Queensland Art Gallery, in Brisbane, Australia, is establishing a dedicated section for the paintings of Raja Ravi Varma.“Several prominent art dealers informed the plaintiff that ‘Kadambari’ is intended for permanent display at this gallery, thereby resulting in its removal from India and beyond the territorial jurisdiction of this court. The plaintiff therefore states that there is an imminent risk of the painting being transferred to the Queensland Art Gallery in Brisbane, Australia,” Verma said in his plea.Appearing for the art collector, advocate Giriraj Subramanium contended that those who profit from the commercialisation of art cannot distance themselves from the responsibility of verifying the title and urged the court to hold the intermediaries accountable.With Verma naming auction houses and market intermediaries as defendants in the suit, any decision by HC is likely to impact the longstanding “culture of informality” in the Indian art trade. The suit also highlights that auction houses and buyers must first verify the provenance of the artwork before going further.","The painting, ‘Kadambari’, by the 19th-century maestro, is at present in the possession of Kiran Nadar Museum of Art.

Bank strike today: Are banks shut amid nationwide Bharat bandh on February 12?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bank-strike-today-are-banks-shut-amid-nationwide-bharat-bandh-on-february-12/articleshow/128235136.cms,"Representative AI image

Will banks remain open today?

Which bank unions are participating — and why?

The nation is observing a Bharat Bandh on Thursday following a nationwide strike call by a joint forum of central trade unions against the Centre’s alleged anti-worker policies. The strike also involves banking unions.Thus, amid the strike, uncertainty looms over banking operations, with customers across cities unsure whether branches will function normally or face disruptions as several bank unions align with the strike call.While banks will remain open, services might face disruptions as major institutions like State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda , and UCO Bank have notified the BSE about potential service impacts during the Bharat Bandh.Bank of Baroda has informed customers through its BSE filing that while it is preparing for normal operations, branch services might be affected if the strike takes place. Similarly, SBI noted that although necessary arrangements have been made to ensure normal functioning, work in branches and offices may be impacted to a limited extent.UCO Bank made similar statements in its BSE filing, stating that steps are being taken for smooth operations but branch functioning could be affected if the strike materialises.For customers wondering about bank services on February 12, it is important to note that while banks are not officially closed, planning transactions in advance may help avoid inconvenience due to possible service limitations.Major bank unions including the All India Bank Employees' Association (AIBEA), All India Bank Officers Association (AIBOA), and Bank Employees Federation of India (BEFI) joined forces with 10 central trade unions for this protest. They have raised concerns over the new labour codes, alleging that the reforms are unfavourable to workers and could make trade union registration more restrictive.The protest also comes at a time when bank associations have been actively campaigning for improved working conditions, including the long-pending demand for a five-day work week to enhance work-life balance for employees.Over 10 central trade unions called for a nationwide Bharat Bandh to protest the government’s “anti-worker” policies. The strike was supported by farmer organisations and other groups across multiple sectors.The bandh was announced as a demonstration against what the unions described as “anti-worker, anti-farmer and anti-national pro-corporate policies of the central government.”Trade unions estimated that nearly 30 crore workers from various sectors were likely to take part in the agitation. The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) urged farmers to join trade union workers to ensure the success of the all-India general strike.","The nation is observing a Bharat Bandh on Thursday following a nationwide strike call by a joint forum of central trade unions against the Centre’s alleged anti- worker policies.

Central government employees and pensioners have reason to cheer with the website for the 8th Pay Commission going live, seeking feedback and inputs from concerned individuals.The 8th Pay Commission was first announced in January 2025, and it was formally notified later through a Ministry of Finance notification issued on November 3, 2025. The government has already approved the 8th Pay Commission’s Terms of Reference (ToR), giving it a period of 18 months to submit its recommendations on revisions to salaries, pensions, and other allowances of government employees and pensioners.With the 8th Pay Commission now constituted, the government has introduced its official website (https://8cpc.gov.in/). With the launch of the website, the 8th Pay Commission has now invited suggestions and feedback from ministries, departments, central government employees, and other stakeholders.In a statement published on the new website, the Commission said it is seeking views, opinions, and inputs to help it make well-informed recommendations. The final date for submitting responses to the questionnaire is Monday, March 16, 2026.

This comes after the aviation giant faced massive operational disruption last December, when the company was forced to cancel more than 5,000 flights within seven days.The fresh intake will span trainee first officers, senior first officers and commanders. A recruitment notice shows the carrier is also ready to accept applicants without time on the Airbus A320, the workhorse aircraft across its network, ET reported.Under the updated framework, the number of landings permitted between 12 am and 6 am has been limited, while the mandatory weekly rest period for pilots has gone up.A review carried out by the irectorate General of Civil Aviation concluded that the airline had neither hired in line with the new rules nor accelerated its training capacity. This, the probe noted, resulted in pilots being stretched through repeated reassignments, lengthier duty spans and greater use of deadheading, in which crew are moved as passengers to operate flights elsewhere.A senior official, as cited by ET, maintained that IndiGo is now lining up a steady supply of cockpit crew to keep pace with rapid aircraft additions.The airline’s in-house system is currently upgrading about 20–25 first officers to captain each month. Now, alongside hiring, the carrier has begun adjusting its network planning to create more breathing space in daily operations. From almost no buffer in December, the margin has been raised to 3% this month. Standby crew availability has also been lifted to a minimum of 15%.Fleet expansion is continuing at a brisk rate, with roughly four aircraft joining the airline every month on average.Training remains a long lead activity. Trainee first officers require around six months before they are cleared to operate, while promotion to captaincy demands at least 1,500 hours of flying, though airlines may prescribe stricter benchmarks.While the regulator’s baseline requirement is three sets of pilots per aircraft, including one captain and one first officer, IndiGo’s intense utilisation levels push its need to well over twice that figure.Figures placed during the inquiry into the December episode showed the airline needed 2,422 captains but had 2,357.After the disruption, the watchdog stepped in with temporary relaxations, suspending night-duty restriction rules until February 10.In its assessment, the DGCA said there was an overriding focus on maximising utilisation of crew, aircraft, and network resources, which significantly reduced roster buffer margins.The Directorate General of Civil Aviation said that the airline structured its crew schedules to extract the longest possible duty hours, leaning heavily on deadheading, tail swaps and stretched work patterns while leaving very little room for recovery. It noted that such planning weakened roster integrity and hurt operational resilience.","The fresh intake will span trainee first officers, senior first officers and commanders.

What does the law say about side hustles for H-1B visa holders?





With several guns trained at H-1Bs in the US and especially in Texas, several social media posts have now flagged home kitchen businesses being run by visa holders 'illegally'. H-1B and their dependents H-4 visas are not legally permitted to do a side hustle in the US and the laws are so strict that content creators are not allowed to monetize their channels but people are advertising their small catering services in closed Facebook or WhatsApp groups hiding from the public eye and scrutiny, the allegations said.One such post showed that an Indian woman in McKinney is offering North Indian crusine for small parties and occasions, for minimum 12 to 15 people. The allegation pointed out that this is illegal by McKinney's local laws as they must have a food establishment permit, have regular inspections and can not operate hot meal catering from a residential kitchen.The allegation pointed out that such operations are illegal on two counts: One, if they are on H-1B or H-4 visas, but if they are not visa holders, then also it is illegal as the Texas Cottage Food Law only allows baked goods to be made at a residential kitchen -- not hot trays.H-1B status authorizes the visa holders to work only for the specific employer that petitioned for (and received approval of) their H-1B petition, and only in the specific specialty occupation and conditions described in that petition. Any other employment whether it's freelancing, driving for Uber/DoorDash, consulting on the side, independent contracting, running a side business that involves active work, or even some content creation/coding gigs is considered unauthorized employment by USCIS.The income may be small, and the clients may be outside the US.Passive income is allowed from investment, stocks, rental as long as they do not require the visa holder's active participation.H-4 visa holders with EAD can own and operate a business as long as it does not violate any other laws.",Social media posts have now flagged home kitchen businesses being run by visa holders 'illegally' H-1B and their dependents H-4 visas are not legally permitted to do a side hustle in the US and the laws are so strict that content creators are not allowed to monetize their channels.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128316059,imgsize-1181297,width-400,resizemode-4/can-h-1b-visa-holders-maintain-a-side-income-in-the-us.jpg"

Why Big Tech is lining up for AI in India

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang will not be traveling to India for the India AI Impact Summit 2026, the company has said. The announcement cited “unforeseen circumstances” for the cancellation, as per a report by news agency Reuters. Huang is widely considered as one of the headline attractions for the five-day event, and was scheduled to address the media on February 18. Nvidia said that it is sending a high-level delegation to represent the company and reiterated its deep commitment to India’s rapidly growing AI and semiconductor ecosystem.""Due to unforeseen circumstances, Jensen Huang is unable to travel to India at this time. NVIDIA remains deeply committed to the AI Impact Summit and to India’s rapidly advancing AI ecosystem. A senior NVIDIA delegation, led by Executive Vice President Jay Puri, will be on the ground to celebrate India’s exceptional AI researchers, startups, developers, and the partners building the nation’s AI infrastructure,” the company said in a statement.The India AI Impact Summit 2026, scheduled to be held from February 16-20 at Bharat Mandapam in New Delhi, is the first global AI summit to be hosted in the Global South. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to inaugurate the 5-day event. CEOs and top executives of the biggest tech companies are all expected to attend.So are 15-20 heads of government, over 50 international ministers, and more than 40 Indian and global CEOs.The summit is organised around three pillars called 'Sutras' — People, Planet, and Progress. These branch into seven 'Chakras' or working groups. Over 700 session proposals have been received. The attendee list include:Indian industrial titans include:India generates nearly 20% of the world's data, and has the second-largest AI workforce as well as over 700 million internet users – providing a huge business opportunity for them to tap the growing base.Anthropic has hired former Microsoft India MD Irina Ghose to lead its India operations while OpenAI has set up a dedicated sales division here. Google and Microsoft have partnered with the government to push AI in education. Recently, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a 21-year tax holiday for data centres – seen as a welcome step to boost India’s IT sector.The India AI Impact Expo spans over 70,000 square metres. It is expected to feature 300-plus exhibitors from 30 countries across seven thematic pavilions.",The India AI Impact Summit 2026 is scheduled to be held from February 16-20 at Bharat Mandapam in New Delhi.

Anthropic CEO again tells US government NOT to do what Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has been 'begging' it for,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/anthropic-ceo-again-tells-us-government-not-to-do-what-nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-has-been-begging-it-for/articleshow/128338383.cms,"Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei strongly opposes selling advanced AI chips to China, viewing them as a national security risk. He argues that while AI's economic benefits should be shared globally, critical compute power must remain out of authoritarian hands. Amodei believes this approach is crucial for maintaining global stability and preventing misuse of AI technology.

Anthropic CEO frames AI chips as a national security chokepoint, not a trade commodity

Why Amodei says 'growth will come easy' but political freedom won't

The Nvidia-Anthropic rivalry is becoming the defining feud in AI policy

Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has once again made it clear that he thinks selling advanced AI chips to China is a terrible idea. In a wide-ranging conversation on the Dwarkesh Patel podcast, Amodei laid out his case for why the US should keep its compute advantage locked down—directly contradicting what Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has been lobbying Washington to do for months now.Amodei didn't mince words. He said the US shouldn't be building data centres in China or shipping chips there, arguing that AI models powered by those chips are ""essentially cognition, essentially intelligence."" His framing was blunt: sell cures for diseases to whoever wants them, build pharmaceutical industries in developing nations, but keep the data centres and the chips firmly out of authoritarian hands.He even floated a scenario where AI tools could be designed to protect citizens inside authoritarian countries from their own governments' surveillance—a kind of individualized digital shield. It's a bold idea, and Amodei admitted he doesn't know if it would work. But he seemed genuinely interested in exploring it.This isn't the first time Amodei has gone after Nvidia's China ambitions. At Davos last month, he compared selling H200 chips to China to ""selling nuclear weapons to North Korea and bragging that Boeing made the casings."" On the podcast, he went further—warning that if both the US and China end up with equally powerful AI systems, the result could be a standoff far more dangerous than nuclear deterrence.His reasoning: unlike nukes, where mutually assured destruction keeps things stable, two rival AI superpowers might each believe they'd win a direct confrontation. That kind of mutual overconfidence, Amodei argued, is historically what starts wars. He also raised the prospect of offensive cyber dominance—a threshold where one side's AI could make every computer system transparent to it, unless the other side has an equally strong defence.Amodei also reframed the entire export debate around something bigger than quarterly revenue. He said economic growth from AI will arrive almost ""faster than we can take it."" The hard part won't be generating value—it'll be distributing it fairly and protecting political freedom in a world where authoritarian governments can weaponise AI against their own people.Rather than cutting developing nations out of the AI boom, he suggested building data centres in Africa and ensuring AI-driven industries like biotech take root outside the West. The pitch: spread the benefits without handing authoritarian governments the keys to the entire AI stack.He went as far as to say that dictatorships might eventually become ""morally obsolete""—not because someone overthrows them, but because the technology itself makes that form of government unworkable. Whether that's optimism or wishful thinking is up for debate.What makes all of this spicier is that Nvidia has poured over $10 billion into Anthropic. Yet Amodei keeps publicly torching Nvidia's biggest policy ask. Huang, for his part, has accused Amodei of wanting more AI regulation only because it benefits Anthropic's competitive position. He's also taken shots at Amodei's warning that AI could eliminate half of entry-level white-collar jobs, calling it self-serving fear-mongering.The two have been trading barbs for the better part of a year now—and if this podcast is anything to go by, neither seems remotely interested in backing down.","Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei says selling AI chips to China is a national security risk.
