DEHRADUN: The Char Dham yatra has witnessed a significant increase in the number of pilgrims visiting the shrines this year, with the footfall already reaching 20 lakh in the first month, compared to 14.5 lakh last year, a spike of 38%, reports. This heavy influx of visitors has evoked concerns among environmentalists and the scientific community as it is leaving tangible and intangible impact on the shrine towns, which are situated in the ecologically-fragile Garhwal Himalayas .At least 2 lakh vehicles have made their way to these towns in the past month, which is way beyond the carrying capacity of the area. The vehicular vibration and emissions are not only causing pollution but also shaking up the hill slopes which may prompt landslides or mudslides during monsoon. Vibrations from back-to-back chopper flights are also contributing to the geological damage in the area, as per experts.Till June 10, 7.6 lakh people have visited Kedarnath, 4.8 lakh have visited Badrinath, and 3.5 lakh have visited Gangotri and Yamunotri each.","The footfall already reached 20 lakh in the first month, compared to 14.5 lakh last year, a spike of 38%, reports.

"Delhi water crisis: ADM, SDM level officers to be deployed in each Zone to monitor situation",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhi-water-crisis-adm-sdm-level-officers-to-be-deployed-in-each-zone-to-monitor-situation/articleshow/110928914.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In response to the ongoing water crisis in Delhi, the government has taken decisive action by deploying high-level officials to each zone. These teams, consisting of Additional District Magistrates, Sub Divisional Magistrates, Tehsildars, and other officials, will serve as 'Quick Response Teams' to ensure the efficient distribution of water tankers and promptly address water-related complaints from residents.

Delhi minister Atishi has instructed the Chief Secretary to oversee these teams as they monitor and inspect the main water distribution network , starting from the water sources and extending to the water treatment plants (WTPs) and primary Underground Reservoirs (UGRs). The teams are tasked with identifying and repairing any leaks in the major pipelines within a 12-hour timeframe, emphasizing the importance of conserving every drop of water during this period of scarcity.

""In the meeting held on 30.05.2024 regarding the issue of prevailing heat wave condition and rise in demand of water, it was decided that from 5th June onwards ADM/SDM level officers would be deployed in each Zone, along with a team of Tehsildars and other officials who will act as a ' Quick Response Team ' for provision of water tankers and resolution of water-related complaints,"" Atishi said in her letter to the Chief Secretary.

Despite these efforts, many residents in various parts of Delhi continue to face water shortages, relying on water tankers to meet their daily needs. The situation has led to long queues in affected areas as people wait to collect water from these tankers.

The water crisis has also sparked a heated debate between Lieutenant-Governor VK Saxena and the AAP government, with each side pointing fingers at the other. The AAP government attributes the water shortage to the BJP-ruled Haryana government, claiming that it has failed to provide Delhi with its rightful share of water. However, the LG refutes this accusation.

After a phone conversation with Haryana Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini on Tuesday, Saxena released a statement asserting that Haryana has been releasing Delhi's allocated share of water into the Yamuna River via the Munak canal. The LG places the blame for the water crisis squarely on the Delhi government, alleging that the shortage is a result of the tanker mafia ""stealing water [from the canal] in connivance with the ruling AAP"".

Pune Porsche crash: Police prepare crash impact analysis report with Army forensic expert's help,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/pune-porsche-crash-police-prepare-crash-impact-analysis-report-with-army-forensic-experts-help/articleshow/110928528.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Pune police , investigating the Porsche car accident case, have generated a comprehensive crash impact analysis report with the help of an Army forensic expert .

The report's purpose is to establish a connection between the Porsche car's impact on the bike and the injuries suffered by the two deceased IT professionals . Police consider this report vital in determining the accused's role in the incident.

On May 19, the Porsche car, purportedly driven by a juvenile under the influence of alcohol , collided with a bike in Pune city's Kalyani Nagar area, resulting in the deaths of Anish Awadhiya and Ashwini Koshta, both IT professionals.

According to a crime branch officer, ""We have obtained the report of crash impact analysis of the accident. The analysis has provided valuable insights into the positioning of the vehicles at the time of impact and the injuries sustained by the deceased. The report will be instrumental in understanding the sequence of events leading to the tragic accident.""

Initially, the police intended to employ AI-based tools and software for digitally reconstructing the accident scene. The goal was to create a detailed visualization of the crime scene to improve evidence appreciation and reconstruct the events preceding the accident.

The juvenile driver is currently in an observation home, while the parents remain in police custody in relation to the alleged blood sample swapping case. Previously, the Pune District Court remanded the father and grandfather of the minor accused to police custody until May 31.

"How insurance cover helped 46,000 women avoid toiling in the sun during heatwave",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-insurance-cover-helped-46000-women-avoid-toiling-in-the-sun-during-heatwave/articleshow/110951433.cms,"In the city of Ahmedabad, temperatures climbed above 43C (109F) every day between May 19 and May 25, creating deadly hot working conditions for many of the labourers who keep the local economy humming.For 40-year-old Lataben Arvindbhai Makwana, it was unbearable to run her sewing machine inside her tin-roofed house, which has little ventilation and only a small ceiling fan. As a daily wage labourer, that meant she was not earning the money she needed to feed her kids and buy blood pressure medication for herself.""It's getting worse every summer,"" Makwana said. The heat is especially dangerous for people like her who suffer from hypertension.With climate change raising temperatures during heat waves , millions of Indians face a difficult choice: work in dangerous conditions or go hungry. But some women like Makwana are now getting help from a program to make a third choice: stop working for at least a few hours.As soon as temperatures breached 43.6C in Ahmedabad, Makwana and thousands of other women were told that ICICI Lombard, an insurance company, would pay them a portion of their daily wages. The program uses parametric insurance, which pays out when a particular metric is hit, such as a daily high temperature.More than 46,000 women across 22 districts in India were paid Rs 2,84,00,000 in total over last month's heat waves. About 50,000 women are enrolled in the program. Makwana's insurance payout was Rs 750, enough to cover food and medication for a few days. (That sum came on top of a separate charity payout of Rs 400 when the temperature breached 40C the first time.)The Self-Employed Women's Association labour union runs the insurance program. Its premium is paid for partly by the women enrolled in the program, with a charity covering the remaining portion. The pilot program launched last year and is set to run until April 2025.Kathy Baughman McLeod, chief executive officer of Climate Resilience for All, the non-profit supporting the program through development, technical expertise and funding, says it has been ""successful."" The charity plans to expand the insurance program to other parts of the world.Baughman Mcleod hopes that the funders supporting the Indian program can continue to do so for a few more years. Ultimately, the plan is to get SEWA 's 2.9 million members signed up, which would allow the plan to be funded entirely by women paying the premiums.""Our experience is that poor women don't want charity always,"" said Reema Nanavaty, general secretary of SEWA. ""Once they see that this program is addressing their dire needs, I'm sure the women would start contributing toward the program.""

New devices to check FASTag to cut toll plaza delays soon: NHAI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/new-devices-to-check-fastag-to-cut-toll-plaza-delays-soon-nhai/articleshow/110950256.cms,"NEW DELHI: Soon you may not have to wait in queues at toll gates due to technical glitches in reading FASTags strapped on vehicles , which often force toll booth operators to use handheld devices to read the smart tag.

The NHAI has ordered a major change in deployment of IT system and hardware at toll plazas for processing transactions through FASTag to make them hassle free for commuters. The highways authority will now only empanel players who have good experience, and they will have to mandatorily procure equipment from manufactures certified by Standardisation Testing and Quality Certification directorate of the ministry of electronics and IT.

The STQC certification will be mandatory for equipment, including RFID reader along with the antenna, automatic number plate reader, toll lane controller and toll plaza server, as per specifications issued by IHMCL, NHAI’s entity responsible for management of tolls.

According to the new specifications, the system integrators will have to give an undertaking to IHMCL that if any deviation are found at toll plazas designated to them because of equipment, the agency will have the right to immediately suspend the empanelment and forfeit the bank guarantee.

TOI , in a report titled ‘FASTag made highways cashless. Here’s why they aren’t jam-less’, had highlighted how commuters face hassle at toll gates even when their FASTags have enough balance due to glitches or inefficiency of hardware and system deployed at plazas that don’t read tags. Toll collectors asked commuters to take their vehicles back and forth or end up using hand-held devices to read the tag.

“We are taking a two-pronged approach to address issues people face due to technical reasons. First, people with experience can only get empanelled and the equipment has to be certified by the most credible govt agency. We are also going to deploy engineers at the regional offices of NHAI for better monitoring and resolution of issues,” said an official.

Govt plans to import additional chana from Australia to check prices,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-plans-to-import-additional-chana-from-australia-to-check-prices/articleshow/110949799.cms,"SPIKE ALERT: As per Union consumer affairs ministry data, average retail prices of chana increased from Rs 74.7 per kg a year back to Rs 85.8 on June 13 and on Wednesday it stood at Rs 87.. (Lexica generated AI image)

NEW DELHI: As rise in price of pulses and fall in production of chana (bengal gram) remain a concern, govt is looking at importing 11 lakh tonne of chana from Australia soon. This will be in addition to the import of 16 lakh tonne of yellow peas used as substitute of chana in the past six months since govt did away with the import duty.

Sources said govt has sounded out Australia about the plan to import more chana in the next few months to increase availability and check prices. Chana has 50% share in pulse production in the country and is widely consumed. Reduction in availability of chana impacts the prices of other pulses.

As per consumer affairs ministry data, the average retail prices of chana has increased from Rs 74.7 per kg a year back to Rs 85.8 on June 13 and on Wednesday it stood at Rs 87.6 per kg. Price of tur dal has also increased by around 27% in the past one year, from Rs 126.4 a kg to Rs 160.3 on Wednesday. Similarly, urad dal price has increased by 13.5% in the past one year. However, there is a minor rise in retail prices of masur dal.

Trade sources said govt’s intention to import more chana from Australia has sent the right signal to growers there and this will result in an increase in seeding this year.

As per the agriculture ministry estimate, gram production in the 2023-24 crop year (July-June) is estimated at 116 lakh tonne, lower than previous year’s 123 lakh tonne. But traders expect the actual harvest to be lower.

Fall in pulses production and increased consumption has resulted in import of more pulses during the current financial year. Sources said the import has increased to 3.7 lakh tonne in the past two months compared to 3.1 lakh tonne during the corresponding period last year.

India slips 2 notches to 129 in WEF global gender gap index,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-slips-2-notches-to-129-in-wef-global-gender-gap-index/articleshow/110949354.cms,"NEW DELHI: India ranked 129 out of 146 countries, two ranks lower than the previous year with a marginally lower score (0.17 points), in the Global Gender Gap Report 2024 released by World Economic Forum on Wednesday. With a population of over 1.4 billion, India closed 64.1% of its gender gap in 2024.The global gender gap score in 2024 for all 146 countries stands at 68.5%. “The lack of meaningful, widespread change since the last edition effectively slows down the rate of progress to attain parity. Based on current data, it will take 134 years to reach full parity — roughly five generations beyond the 2030 Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target,” the report highlights. The Gender Gap Index shows that while no country has achieved full gender parity, 97% of the economies included in this edition have closed more than 60% of their gap, compared to 85% in 2006.Last year, India ranked 127 on the index showing an improvement by 1.4 percentage points and eight positions from 135 in 2022. India had closed 64.3% of the overall gender gap, the 2023 report had observed, marking a partial recovery towards India’s 2020 (66.8%) parity level.On India dropping two rungs in the latest index, the report highlights that “this slight regression is mainly the result of small declines in educational attainment and political empowerment, while economic participation and opportunity slightly improves.”The report noted that parity in educational attainment is well underway, but challenges remain. Updated figures in educational attainment bring India’s parity levels slightly down from prior scores. “While the shares of women are high in primary, secondary and tertiary education enrolments, they have only been modestly increasing, and the gap between men and women’s literacy rate is 17.2 percentage points wide, leaving India ranked 124th on this indicator,” it is stated in the report.In the political empowerment subindex, while India scores within the top 10 on the head-of-state indicator (40.7%), the country’s scores for women’s representation at the federal level, in ministerial positions (6.9%) and in Parliament (17.2%), remain relatively low.The index ranked India's neighbours Bangladesh at 99, China at 106, Nepal at 117, Sri Lanka at 122, Bhutan at 124 and Pakistan at 145. Iceland (93.5%) is again ranked first and has been leading the index for a decade and a half.

Red Fort attack: President rejects mercy plea of Pakistani man,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/red-fort-attack-president-rejects-mercy-plea-of-pakistani-man/articleshow/110948946.cms,"NEW DELHI: President Droupadi Murmu has rejected the mercy petition filed by Pakistani terrorist and death row convict in the Dec 2000 Red Fort attack case Mohd Arif alias Ashfaq, almost 18 months after the Supreme Court dismissed his review petition.Arif was part of the two-member, armed Lashkar-e-Taiba squad that stormed into the Red Fort premises housing a unit of 7th Rajputana Rifles on Dec 22, 2000, and opened fire at the jawans on duty, killing three of them. Though both the terrorists, following retaliatory fire by the personnel on duty, escaped by scaling Red Fort’s rear wall, they left behind enough clues — including firearms like AK rifles as well as an accidentally dropped paper slip with a phone number that ultimately led them to Arif’s house in Delhi’s Ghazipur area.Arif was arrested three days after the attack. An investigation and trial ensued, ending in the trial court convicting him under IPC, Arms Act, Explosive Substances Act and Foreigners Act and awarding him death sentence. The death sentence was affirmed by Delhi High Court in 2007 and upheld by the Supreme Court in 2011. On Nov 3, 2022, a three-judge bench dismissed Arif’s review petition. He filed a mercy petition with the President on May 15, 2024 and the latter rejected it on May 27. This is the second mercy petition to be rejected by Murmu, the first being that of Vasanta Sampat Dupare who was awarded the death sentence for raping and murdering a minor girl.Arif still has the option of moving the SC challenging the rejection of his mercy plea. A key change being made via the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) — which comes into force from July 1 — is that the President’s decision on a mercy plea shall be final and courts cannot question the grounds for such decision. However, this shall apply only prospectively.A resident of Pakistan, Arif received training from LeT in the use of arms like AK-56 rifle and hand grenades. He illegally crossed over to India in 1999 along with arms and ammunition and stayed in Srinagar with other LeT terrorists. Tasked by LeT to unleash an attack at the iconic Red Fort, he collected money for the mission through hawala channels. He arranged cover for himself by marrying Delhi resident Rehmana Yusuf Farooqui, who was also convicted in the case. He forged documents including driving licence and ration card and was running a computer centre in Ghazipur.Arif, after confessing his involvement in the Red Fort attack, had led Delhi Police to his second hideout in Batla House, Okhla, where an encounter broke out, leading to the death of his aide Abu Shamal alias Faizal. A search at the hideout led to the recovery of an AK-56 rifle and ammunition. Investigations into Arif’s money and bank dealings helped establish the terror funding trail.This is the second mercy petition to be rejected by Murmu, the first being that of Vasanta Sampat Dupare who was awarded the death sentence for raping and murdering a minor girl","President Droupadi Murmu has rejected the mercy petition filed by Pakistani terrorist and death row convict in the Dec 2000 Red Fort attack case Mohd Arif alias Ashfaq.

The apex court warned the Delhi government, saying ""If you can't deal with tanker mafia , we will ask Delhi Police to take action."" The court questioned the measures taken by the government to control water wastage, considering the recurring problem of water scarcity during summers. The court further emphasized the suffering of the people, noting the visuals being shown on every news channel.

The top court also directed the Delhi government to file an affidavit detailing the measures it has implemented to control water wastage.

Delhi Lt Governor VK Saxena met Haryana chief minister Nayab Singh Saini on Tuesday who assured him that water is being supplied to the national capital according to its allocated share.

Over the past two weeks, the ruling AAP government has repeatedly accused the BJP-led Haryana government of restricting Delhi's share of water.

In an effort to address the issue, Mr Saxena met with Delhi ministers Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj on Monday. He assured them that he would discuss the water supply problem with the Haryana government and advised against engaging in a ""blame game,"" encouraging the resolution of issues in an amicable manner.

Market analysts are of the view that the stock market seems to be in consolidation mode due to the absence of any new catalysts. Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Retail Research, Motilal Oswal, says, ""Globally, investors are cautiously awaiting US CPI data and US Fed policy outcome which will be released tomorrow. The US Fed commentary could provide direction to the market. So far investors are baking in one rate cut towards the end of the year and any deviation from that could drive the market on either side.""

Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities says that the index is currently placed at the hurdle of 23400-23500 levels, which are weighing high for the market to sustain the new all-time highs, suggesting a possibility of a dip in the market. Immediate support is at 23050 levels, he said.

Oil prices ticked higher on Wednesday due to upbeat global demand views from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and OPEC. Brent crude futures rose 11 cents to $82.04 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 18 cents to settle at $78.10.

Parts of the city have reported frequent power cuts this month with people blaming outdated infrastructure and cable snags.Shiv Shakti Apartment in Sector 71 saw a 10-hour-long power cut, while intermittent outages and voltage fluctuations were reported at Sector 105 on Tuesday and Wednesday. Complaints of intermittent to long outages and voltage fluctuations were reported from sectors 55, 56, 72, 11, 12.The temperature in Noida hovered around 44 degrees Celsius this afternoon.RWA representatives of sectors 117 and 44 met power department officials on Wednesday seeking redress for internal sector lines. ""For the last few weeks, we have been facing multiple power failures during the night. Power was supplied in phases today, due to which, four of our lifts remained non-functional. We are still assessing the damage to our equipment. The power went off three times in 10 minutes without any warning. This is unacceptable,"" said Navneet Chandra, a resident of Krishna Apra Residency in Sector 61.Sanjay Shukla, RWA general secretary of Shiv Shakti Apartment said, ""Residents are suffering everyday with merely 10 hours of supply a day and that too with intermittent cuts. Officials are requested to pay attention to this as the heat is unbearable, especially for children and the elderly.""SDO Deepak Kumar and engineer Mahipal Singh said that the problems will be addressed.Sector 44 RWA president Sudhir Sood held a similar meeting with the area's SDO Kuldeep Tomar, JE Anuj Verma among others. ""We have been facing unannounced power cuts for several months. Our feeder for the underground cable was loaded with supply for Chalera and Salarpur villages which often led to overloading and outages. This was separated about a month back. However, an upgrade of our sector's dilapidated substation is on the cards as all equipment like transformers, feeders, panels, etc need to be replaced. During monsoon, the substation would be flooded with seepage from the roof,"" said Sood.Tomar said the substation would be upgraded in the coming months.Meanwhile, in Ghaziabad, a series of 4 to 5 hours long power cuts continue in rural and urban parts of the city amid scorching heat. In some places, transformers caught fire, while in others local faults resulted in outages. Mansarovar, Raj Compound, Deep Vihar reported outages from 11am to 2am, while there were powercuts in Vijaynagar for 4 to 5 hours. Similar instances were reported in Nandgram, Meerut Road, Patel Nagar, Lohia Nagar.

Get more if you surrender life cover with new norms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/get-more-if-you-surrender-life-cover-with-new-norms/articleshow/110952064.cms,"MUMBAI: Life insurance policyholders will receive better surrender values after a one-year period and find their policies to be more liquid investments following an overhaul of norms by regulator Irdai .

On Wednesday, Irdai issued a new master circular on life insurance products to address the pain points of those who have purchased life insurance policies. The new norms require insurers to ensure that the special surrender value is at least equal to the paid-up sum assured, paid-up future benefits and accrued and vested benefits. The free-look period - which provides time to review the policy terms and conditions - is now increased to 30 days from 15 days earlier.

In the past, policyholders suffered huge losses if a policy was discontinued after a year. Now, however, the higher surrender value norms make it unprofitable for insurance companies to have customers who seek to discontinue their policy after a year and hence, incentivise them to increase their business's persistency.

To ensure policyholders have access to liquidity in emergencies, all non-linked savings products offering surrender value shall have the facility of a policy loan based on the eligible surrender value. They would also provide for partial withdrawal from pension plans for emergency reasons such as higher education, marriage, purchase/construction of a house or treatment of illness.

Irdai, in a statement, said that the new rules establish mechanisms to improve persistency, curb misselling, avoid financial loss to policyholders, and enhance long-term benefits for them. To facilitate financial planning and enhance the flexibility in premium payments, insurers are now permitted to offer products with a range of premium payment term.

The overhaul of life insurance product norms comes in the wake of the regulator making health and general insurance norms more customer-friendly. Just like in health and non-life covers, Irdai has directed companies to improve their grievance redressal mechanisms. ""In case the insurer does not appeal against the award of insurance ombudsman and does not implement the same within 30 days, a penalty of Rs 5,000 per day shall be payable to the complainant,"" the circular said.

India to have its first-ever Olympic hospitality house in Paris,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/more-sports/others/india-to-have-its-first-ever-olympic-hospitality-house-in-paris/articleshow/110948473.cms,"NEW DELHI: Indian athletes have often complained about food and lack of homely feeling when they compete in multisport events such as the Olympics, Asian Games or CWG. A case in point is the food issue raised by the country’s contingent during the Youth Olympics in 2018 in Buenos Aires, Argentina or the two Asiads in Incheon (2014) and Jakarta (2018).The upcoming Paris Olympics , scheduled from July 26 to August 11, may give the Indian athletes a reason to feel happy about. In a first-of-its-kind initiative, the Indian Olympic Association ( IOA ) – led by legendary athlete P T Usha – has decided to host the first-ever ‘India House’ at the Paris Games. The pavilion will showcase the country’s rich cultural heritage, have yoga sessions, medal celebrations, meet-and-greet opportunities with Indian athletes and multi-cuisine Indian restaurants.Many participating nations at the Olympics have their own hospitality houses but this will be the first time that India will be having one to showcase its culture and heritage. The initiative is a joint collaboration between the IOA and Reliance Foundation – the principal partner of the country’s national Olympic committee (NOC) – which will build the India House.The hospitality centre will come up at a 40,000 square feet facility near the Games Village, serving as the ‘home away from home’ for the Indian athletes and their families. It’s been learnt that a dedicated section at India House will commemorate the country’s 100-year journey at the Olympics.Previously, the JSW Group had announced it would set up a first-ever India ‘Hospitality House’ at the Tokyo Olympics in 2020. The centre was supposed to come up in Tokyo’s Ariake region. However, the idea was shelved as the entire Games was held in a bio-bubble due to the Covid-19 pandemic.“When we were in Paris last month, we did have an opportunity to go and have a look at the place where the India House is being set up. It’s basically a facility which is not only meant for athletes but also for the Indian diaspora and fans to visit and enjoy the direct feed of matches involving Indian athletes. A lot of cultural activities have been being planned where we will showcase India’s tourism, progress made in digitalisation and cultural activities. There will be a dedicated Indian food section for the country’s athletes and travelling Indian fans and mediapersons. Two restaurants will be set up which will serve food dishes from North and South India,” said IOA president P T Usha.“There will be yoga sessions every morning for the locals to attend. India House will be surrounded by other country-specific hospitality houses from France, Canada and the Netherlands. We have also planned to showcase mallakhamb sport to the locals, which was a demo sport at the first-ever Olympic Games in 1904,” Usha added.The facility will be inaugurated on July 28, a day after the opening ceremony on July 26. It’s been learnt that there could be a modification in the name of India House, giving it a more traditional touch.","The Indian Olympic Association has decided to host the first-ever ‘India House’ at the Paris Games.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations. These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class. The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

The dark side of host clubs: Hundreds of women in Japan coerced into sex,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/the-dark-side-of-host-clubs-hundreds-of-women-in-japan-coerced-into-sex/articleshow/110881740.cms,"NEW DELHI: Japan ’s host clubs , renowned for their glamorous male hosts who entertain female clients, are facing increasing scrutiny over allegations of debt and exploitation . The industry, which thrives on the allure of companionship and luxury, has come under fire as former hosts and clients reveal troubling practices behind the scenes.

As per a CNN report, several ex-hosts described a work environment where debt is often used as a tool of control. One former host, Tatsuya, recounted how he was lured by the promise of high earnings but quickly found himself trapped in a cycle of debt. “They told me I could make a lot of money, but I ended up owing the club more than I made,” Tatsuya said. The pressure to meet sales quotas led many hosts to spend their own money to buy expensive drinks for clients, further deepening their financial woes.

Clients, too, have fallen victim to these practices. Many women, enticed by the attention and affection of hosts, spend exorbitant amounts of money to maintain these relationships. Some end up in significant debt, forced to take on multiple jobs or even engage in sex work to pay off what they owe. “I felt special and wanted, but it came at a huge cost,” said one former client who wished to remain anonymous.

The darker side of the host club industry extends beyond financial exploitation . Reports have emerged of emotional manipulation, where hosts use affection and psychological tactics to encourage clients to spend more. Former host Ryo explained, “We were trained to make clients feel valued and loved, but it was all a strategy to get them to spend more money.”

These revelations have sparked a public outcry and calls for regulatory action. Critics argue that the host club industry preys on vulnerable individuals and perpetuates cycles of debt and exploitation. Advocacy groups are urging the Japanese government to implement stricter regulations to protect both hosts and clients from these predatory practices.

In response to the growing controversy, some host clubs have pledged to reform their business practices. However, many believe that more comprehensive measures are needed to address the systemic issues within the industry. Until then, the glamorous facade of Japan’s host clubs will continue to mask a much grimmer reality for those ensnared in its web.",Japan’s host clubs are facing increasing scrutiny over allegations of debt and exploitation.

The statement said inflation remains ""elevated"".

US inflation cooled in May in a sign that price pressures may be easing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-inflation-cooled-in-may-in-a-sign-that-price-pressures-may-be-easing/articleshow/110945323.cms,"WASHINGTON: Inflation in the United States eased in May for a second straight month, a hopeful sign that a pickup in prices that occurred early this year may have passed. The trend, if it holds, could move the Federal Reserve closer to cutting its benchmark interest rate from its 23-year peak.Consumer prices excluding volatile food and energy costs — the closely watched “core” index — rose 0.2% from April to May, the government said Wednesday. That was down from 0.3% the previous month and was the smallest increase since October. Measured from a year earlier, core prices climbed 3.4%, below last month’s 3.6% rise. That was the mildest such increase in three years.Fed officials are scrutinizing each month’s inflation data to assess their progress in their fight against rising prices. Even as overall inflation moderates, such necessities as groceries, rent and health care are much pricier than they were three years ago — a continuing source of public discontent and a political threat to President Joe Biden’s re-election bid. Most other measures suggest that the economy is healthy: Unemployment remains low, hiring is robust and consumers are traveling, eating out and spending on entertainment.Wednesday's report suggested that consumers are beginning to get some relief from the price spikes of the past three years. Grocery costs were unchanged, on average, from April to May, after actually falling 0.2% the previous month. Food prices have risen just 1% over the past 12 months, though they're still up about 20% from three years ago.Average gas prices tumbled 3.6% nationally just from April to May, though they're 2.2% higher than they were a year earlier. Those declines have continued, with gas averaging $3.45 a gallon Wednesday, down 17 cents from a month ago. Americans didn't drive as much over the Memorial Day weekend as they have in previous years, reducing demand, and oil prices have fallen.Overall inflation also slowed last month, with consumer prices unchanged from April to May. Measured from a year earlier, prices rose 3.3%, less than the 3.6% increase a month earlier.“It's certainly welcome news,” said Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at PGIM Fixed Income. ""It drives home that the inflation challenge in the United States is not as challenging as monetary policy makers believe.”Airfares, furniture and clothing also dropped in price last month, helping keep inflation in check. And the cost of auto insurance, which has soared in recent months, actually dipped from April to May, though it's still up more than 20% from a year earlier.The Fed has kept its key rate unchanged for nearly a year after having rapidly raised it in 2022 and 2023 to fight the worst bout of inflation in four decades. Those higher rates have led, in turn, to more expensive mortgages, auto loans, credit cards and other forms of consumer and business borrowing. Though inflation is now far below its peak of 9.1% in mid-2022, it remains above the Fed’s target level.Persistently elevated inflation has posed a vexing challenge for the Fed, which raises interest rates — or keeps them high — to try to slow borrowing and spending, cool the economy and ease the pace of price increases.The longer the Fed keeps borrowing costs high, the more it risks weakening the economy too much and causing a recession. Yet if it cuts rates too soon, it risks reigniting inflation. Most of the policymakers have said they think their rate policies are slowing growth and should curb inflation over time.Inflation had fallen steadily in the second half of last year, raising hopes that the Fed could pull off a “soft landing,” whereby it manages to conquer inflation through higher interest rates without causing a recession. Such an outcome is difficult and rare.But inflation came in unexpectedly high in the first three months of this year, delaying hoped-for Fed rate cuts and possibly imperiling a soft landing.In early May, Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank needed more confidence that inflation was returning to its target before it would reduce its benchmark rate. Several Fed officials have said in recent weeks that they needed to see several consecutive months of lower inflation.Some signs suggest that inflation will continue to cool in the coming months. Americans, particularly lower-income households, are pulling back on their spending. In response, several major retail and restaurant chains, including Walmart, Target, Walgreen’s, McDonald’s and Burger King, have responded by announcing price cuts or deals.","Consumer prices excluding volatile food and energy costs rose 0.2% from April to May.

The relationship ended badly, the reports said, leading to recriminations over text and email as she left the company and signed an agreement prohibiting her from discussing her work for Musk.Several former employees quoted in the WSJ report confirmed that the culture in SpaceX is 'Elon is SpaceX and SpaceX is Elon' and therefore he can act with impunity.",The report is based on the accounts of four women - all of them claimed to have relationship with the billionaire.

We still are going through it, understanding it, and seeing what needs to be done there,"" he added.Industry and government officials met at the AI Retreat on Tuesday, a brainstorming event at Dubai's ellipse-shaped, Arabic-inscribed Museum of the Future.In a keynote, Olama said the UAE wanted to be a ""global player"" with companies that ""take the world by storm"".Addressing questions about a possible gap in talent in the UAE, he remained upbeat.""If you look at the progress that was made over the last five years and the snowballing of the talent that has moved into the UAE, I'm not worried that we'll be able to bridge that gap very quickly,"" he said.The UAE, which wields some of the world's biggest sovereign wealth assets, is also intent on developing a semiconductor industry to profit from rising demand for AI chips.""There are definitely discussions, and we are open to partnering with the right partners wherever they come from, whether it's in Europe or the US,"" Olama said.In response to reports that the US is slowing exports of AI chips to countries in the region, he commented: ""We would love to not be put in a bucket with other countries in this domain.""""I am hopeful, and I do believe that we are going to come up with a solution that is going to meet the requirements of all parties,"" the Minister added.","The United Arab Emirates is in ""complete alignment"" with the US on developing artificial intelligence, the country's AI minister says.

Pakistan has been in talks with the IMF for a loan estimated to range from $6 billion to $8 billion as it seeks to avert a default in the face of its economy growing the slowest among all countries of the region.Islamabad entered into a $6.5 billion three-year agreement with IMF in 2019. It received a final $3 billion under a standby arrangement last year, just before the agreement was to expire.The finance ministry and IMF were reportedly locked in last-minute talks as the global lender presented some more tough conditions last week to include in the budget.A ministry official said the IMF's key demands include a higher tax revenue target, withdrawal of subsidies, taxes on the agriculture sector, increased taxes and levies on the power, gas, and oil sectors, privatisation of sick govt organisations and units, and improved administration.Despite Pakistan's aggressive pursuit of economic diplomacy to improve trade and investment ties with other nations, finance ministerMuhammad Aurangzeb , who presented the budget in parliament, explicitly said there were no alternatives to IMF under the current circumstances.""As you all know, I have been in this role for about three to three and a half months,"" he said at a presser. ""But even when I was in the private sector, I was very loud and clear that we should go into the IMF programme because there is no plan B. If there were a plan B, the IMF would not be called the lender of last resort. There's a reason for that.""Even with depleted foreign reserves and an economic crisis, the govt allocated 2,100 billion rupees to defence in the federal budget, a 19% increase over the previous year. IMF hasn't demanded cuts in defence spending so far.A day earlier, the govt unveiled the Pakistan Economic Survey 2023-24, which showed that the economy failed to meet most of its targets set in the previous budget.The finance minister also addressed IMF's insistence on ending tax exemptions for a fresh loan.""There are no sacred cows. Everyone has to contribute to this economy. The country can only be run with taxes. This is a basic principle,"" he said.",Pakistan has been in talks with the IMF for a loan estimated to range from $6 billion to $8 billion.

Pakistan installs social media firewall,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-installs-social-media-firewall/articleshow/110883200.cms,"Government sources said the firewall would apply to all popular platforms (AP photo)

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has started installing a nationwide firewall system to regulate social media platforms and stop the spread of undesirable content. Government sources said the firewall would apply to all popular platforms like Facebook, YouTube and X.

The firewall, a senior official said, seeks to identify sources of propaganda material, examine data from various internet protocol addresses and limit the content’s visibility. One of the system’s primary functions is keyword filtering, which identifies and hides offensive content .

Additionally, protocols are being developed to oversee Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), which many have employed to evade limitations placed on X, formerly Twitter. Initial restrictions on VPNs drew criticism from the corporate sector, which led the govt to temporarily suspend its implementation.

The X blockade has brought its usage in Pakistan to almost half, from 4.5 million to 2.4 million users. It seems the management of X is gradually adhering to govt directives to block accounts that disseminate fake news, allow conversations on sensitive subjects or circulate contentious ideas.

In April, the home ministry had provided the Islamabad high court a detailed report outlining the rationale for X’s prohibition. The report brought attention to X’s non-registration and its disregard for Pakistani legal requirements.

The report claimed that X’s refusal to comply with Pakistani regulations was the reason for its blocking. It argued that the action did not infringe on fundamental rights.

Pakistan and IMF disagree over new income tax rates that will burden salaried class,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-and-imf-disagree-over-new-income-tax-rates-that-will-burden-salaried-class/articleshow/110836835.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Talks between Pakistan and the IMF have ended inconclusively due to a disagreement over new income tax rates for salaried and non-salaried persons and the imposition of a standard 18 per cent sales tax on agriculture and health sector goods, according to a media report on Sunday.On Friday, Pakistan and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) authorities discussed the outstanding issues related to taxation and the energy sector.Citing sources, the Express Tribune newspaper reported that both sides could not resolve their differences on the income tax threshold, the merger of salaried and non-salaried rates and the maximum income tax rate for individuals.Discussions are revolving around whether to charge a new backbreaking 45 per cent income tax from salaried and non-salaried individuals on a monthly income of just over Pakistani Rs 4,67,000, sources said.At present, the maximum rate of 35 per cent applies to a monthly income of over Pakistani Rs 5,00,000.However, both sides have converged on the issue of increasing the income tax burden on exporters in the next budget who paid a paltry sum of Pakistani Rs 86 billion this year, which is 280 per cent less than the taxes paid by the salaried people.Pakistan also showed a willingness to tax pensions beyond a certain income threshold.In the latest talks, the international money lender insisted on merging the slabs related to salaried, non-salaried and other incomes.On the government's proposal of increasing the annual threshold of taxable income to Pakistani Rs 9,00,000, the IMF is asking for the maximum income tax rate to be increased from 35 per cent to 45 per cent.However, the government is unwilling to increase the maximum rate for salaried individuals to 45 per cent but showed flexibility to keep the taxable income threshold at the current Pakistani Rs 6,00,000.It is also asking to keep the salaried and non-salaried slabs separate but is willing to increase the highest tax rate for non-salaried persons to 45 per cent, said the sources.The non-salaried business individuals pay tax after excluding expenses while the salaried persons pay tax on their gross income without excluding the expenses.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is until now unwilling to increase the burden on the salaried class .According to a proposal, if the taxable income threshold is increased to Pakistani Rs 900,000 per annum, the income tax rate can be up to 7.5 per cent on a monthly income of Pakistani Rs 100,000. The current rate is 2.5 per cent for this category.For the next slab, if the monthly income is up to Pakistani Rs 133,000, the under-discussion tax rate is 20 per cent. The current rate is 12.5 per cent, that too for up to a monthly income of Pakistani Rs 200,000.The IMF wants a higher rate at the lower income level. This slab will directly hit Pakistan's middle-income group.At present, on an income of over Pakistani Rs 500,000, a 35 per cent tax rate is charged. The salaried class has until now paid Pakistani Rs 325 billion in income tax in 11 months, which is expected to rise to around Pakistani Rs 360 billion at the end of the current fiscal year.If the revised income tax rates are accepted, the tax contribution of the salaried class will jump to Pakistani Rs 540 billion in the next fiscal year, said the sources. To absorb this increase in the tax rates, even a 30 per cent pay hike will not be sufficient.Sources said that the IMF had asked Pakistan to share alternative proposals, in case it was unwilling to increase the tax burden on the salaried class. Another round of discussions is expected soon.Sources said that an understanding had been reached between Pakistan and the IMF on changing the tax regime for the richest exporters.As against the existing one per cent final income tax on exporters, it has been proposed that from the next fiscal year, the one per cent rate should be treated as a minimum, according to government sources.Pakistan's taxation system promotes inequality and puts a higher burden on people who have little capacity to bear it. The IMF has asked Pakistan to end all special tax regimes, like the low-income tax on gains made by investing in the stock market and bank deposits.The global lender has recommended treating these gains as part of normal income. The IMF is pushing Pakistan to increase the burden on the salaried class until the country recovers higher taxes from the non-salaried business individuals.During the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, the exporters paid a paltry sum of Pakistani Rs 85.5 billion in taxes, which was Pakistani Rs 241 billion, or 280 per cent, less than the amount paid by the salaried class.During July-May FY24, the salaried class paid Pakistani Rs 326 billion in taxes, higher by 40 per cent, or Pakistani Rs 93 billion, compared to the same period last year.The record Pakistani Rs 326 billion in tax payments by the salaried class is also 223 per cent more than the combined tax paid by the rich exporters and influential retailers.Sources said that there was also no consensus on slapping the standard 18 per cent sales tax on fertiliser, pesticides and seeds – the crucial inputs for the agriculture sector.The government was also unwilling to impose an 18 per cent sales tax on medicines, solar panels and medical and surgical equipment. In case, the 18 per cent tax is imposed on medicines, there will be an additional collection of Pakistani Rs 130 billion in the next fiscal year.Similarly, taxing the medical and health-related supplies will generate another Pakistani Rs 100 billion, according to the paper.Pakistan urgently needs a new loan from the IMF to keep the fear of default at bay. The government is eager to ink the agreement before the end of June when the fiscal year ends.","Talks between Pakistan and the IMF have ended inconclusively due to a disagreement over new income tax rates for salaried and non-salaried persons.

Nepal Parliament approves ratification for framework agreement related to International Solar Alliance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/nepal-parliament-approves-ratification-for-framework-agreement-related-to-international-solar-alliance/articleshow/110819158.cms,"File Photo (Picture Credit: ANI)

KATHMANDU: Nepal's House of Representatives has passed a proposal seeking ratification of a framework agreement related to the membership of the International Solar Alliance that will help the Himalayan nation increase usage of solar power in its effort to combat the impact due to changing climate. The House of Representatives (HoR), or the Lower House on Thursday endorsed the proposal tabled by minister for energy, water resources and irrigation, Shakti Bahadur Basnet through a majority vote.

The International Solar Alliance (ISA) was conceived as a joint effort by India and France to mobilise efforts against climate change through the deployment of solar energy solutions and announced on the sidelines of the 21st Conference of Parties (COP21) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) at Paris in 2015.

With the amendment of its Framework Agreement in 2020, all member states of the United Nations are eligible to join the ISA. At present, 119 countries, including Nepal, are signatories to the ISA Framework Agreement, of which 98 countries have submitted the necessary instruments of ratification to become full members of the ISA.

Responding to queries raised by lawmakers from various political parties, Basnet said that the agreement was tabled in keeping with the national interest of the country as clean energy is essential for minimising the impacts of climate change.

""The installation of solar energy will be important for Nepal's development,"" he pointed out and informed the House that the government has already moved the process for the generation of 1,000 MW through solar power in the next couple of years.

A competitive bidding for Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) has already started for the same and bidding for PPA of 800 MW has already opened, he added.

Rajendra Khatrichhetri, a lawmaker belonging to opposition Nepali Congress, welcomed the government's move as he said, ""This is a good proposal as it will provide cheap and affordable energy to the general public and also helps to minimise the impacts of climate change.""

Currently, Nepal has 13 projects generating 68.38 MW of solar power, according to Nepal's Energy Development Department. In September 2023, Nepal announced that it plans to develop 30,000 MW of electricity by 2035 and would club hydropower and solar power.","Nepal's House of Representatives has passed a proposal seeking ratification of a framework agreement related to the International Solar Alliance.
