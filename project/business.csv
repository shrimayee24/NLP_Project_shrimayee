NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday concluded his two-day visit to the US where he held bilateral talks with President Donald Trump. The two leaders discussed key issues including trades, tariffs, extradition of 26/11 accused, Russia-Ukraine war, purchase of F-35 fighter jets and India's border dispute with China.Setting the tone of the ""MEGA partnership"", PM Modi highlighted India and US's shared commitment to economic growth and global leadership.""President Trump often talks about MAGA. In India, we are working towards a Viksit Bharat, which in American context translates into MIGA. And together, the India-USA have a MEGA partnership for prosperity!"" he said.India and the US set a bilateral trade target of $500 billion by 2030 in a effort to ensure joint development, joint production and transfer of technology. The terms of the agreement would be decided soon, said PM Modi.""The people of America are well aware of President Trump's motto 'MAGA - Make America Great Again.' The people of India too are focusing on heritage and development as they move forward at a fast pace and with a firm resolve towards the goal of Viksit Bharat 2047,"" PM Modi said.""In the language of America, it's Make India Great Again - MIGA. When America and India work together, this MAGA plus MIGA becomes a 'mega partnership for prosperity' and it is this mega spirit that gives new scale and scope to our objectives. Today, we have also set a target to increase our bilateral trade to more than double, reaching $500 billion by 2030. Our teams will work on finalising very soon a mutually beneficial trade agreement,"" he addedMarking a significant boost to defense cooperation, Donald Trump said that the US would sell F-35 stealth fighter jets to India, placing the country among an elite group operating the advanced aircraft.""Starting this year, we'll be increasing military sales to India by many billions of dollars. We're also paving the way to ultimately provide India with the F-35 stealth fighters,"" Trump said.The Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II, the most extensively deployed fifth-generation fighter jet, participated in the 15th edition of Aero India, Asia's largest aerospace and defense expo earlier this month.In a significant boost to the energy sector, India is set to buy US energy of almost $25 billion in the near future.""Last year, we purchased about $15 billion in US Energy output. There is a good chance that this figure will go up to as much as 25 billion dollars in the near future,"" ministry of external affairs said in a presser.The talks between the two leaders focused also on increasing energy purchases, which could play a key role in balancing the trade deficit between India and the United States. Officials indicated that expanded energy trade is a strong possibility and could contribute to narrowing the gap in bilateral trade.The US president has offered to mediate in the India-China border dispute and has called for a de-escalation.""I look at India, I do see the skirmishes on the border, which are quite vicious, and I guess they continue to go on. If I could be of help, I'd love to help, because that should be stopped,"" Trump said.PM Modi talked about the issue of illegal immigration and expressed India's readiness to take back those citizens living unlawfully in the US. However, he emphasized that the issue extended beyond deportation, highlighting the role of human traffickers who mislead individuals with false promises.There were no comments on the ""inhuman treatment"" given to the recent deportees when they were restrained and sent back to the country.""Those who stay in other countries illegally do not have any legal right to be there. As far as India and the US are concerned, we have always said that those who are verified and are truly the citizens of India - if they live in the US illegally, India is ready to take them back,"" PM Modi said.US approved the extradition of 26/11 accused Tahawwur Rana to India, marking another key takeaway from the visit.""Today I am pleased to announce that my administration has approved the extradition of one of the plotters and very evil people of the world, and having to do with the horrific Mumbai terrorist attack, to face justice in India. So, he is going back to India to face justice,"" Trump said.In January, the US Supreme Court had approved Rana's extradition by dismissing his review petition in the case.PM Modi's visit to the US did not have a significant impact on Donald Trump's recent move to impose 25% tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from India.Rather, Trump said that the States would prefer a ""reciprocal approach"" on tariffs. ""We are, right now, a reciprocal nation. We are going to, if it's India or if it's somebody else with low tariffs, we're going to have the same. We're going to have whatever India charges, we're charging them. Whatever another country charges, we're charging them,"" Trump said.He also reiterated his ""100% tariffs"" on Brics nations threat if they tried to replace the US dollar with any other currency.""I don't care, but Brics was put there for a bad purpose and most of those people don't want it. They don't even want to talk about it now. They're afraid to talk about it because I told them if they want to play games with the dollar, then they're going to be hit with a 100 per cent tariff. The day they mention that they want to do it and they will come back and say we beg you, we beg you not to do this. Brics is dead since I mentioned that. Brics died the minute I mentioned that and I know I remember when Obama and Biden, in particular, I guess he said that oh, they have us over a barrel,"" he said.PM Modi reiterated India's stance on the Russia-Ukraine war and said that the country was in favour of establishing peace.""I have always been in close contact with Russia and Ukraine. I have met the leaders of both countries. Many people are in a misconception that India is neutral, but I want to reiterate that India is not neutral; we are on a side, and that is peace,"" he said.He lauded Trump's efforts to resolve the conflict through dialogue, and said that negotiations were the key to ending the crisis.""I have said that 'this is not a time of war' in front of the media when President Putin was with me. Even today, my conviction is that the solutions to war cannot be found on the battlefield, and ultimately, we have to be at the table,"" he said.PM Modi and US President Trump shared a warm moment with hugs and handshakes at the White House.Trump also gifted PM Modi a book titled 'Our Journey together' which featured images from key events like 'Howdy Modi' and 'Namaste Trump'.The book signed by Trump said, ""Mr Prime Minister, you are great.""","Prime Minister Narendra Modi concluded his two-day visit to the US where he held bilateral talks with President Donald Trump. The two leaders discussed key issues including trades, tariffs, extradition of 26/11 accused, Russia-Ukraine war, purchase of F-35 fighter jets and India's border dispute with China.

When will your loan EMIs come down?

Loan EMI calculator after RBI MPC meet: Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Sanjay Malhotra on Friday announced the Monetary Policy Committee’s unanimous decision to cut the key repo rate by 25 basis points. Repo rate is the rate at which banks are able to borrow money from the RBI.A repo rate cut is always good news for home loan borrowers, since EMIs come down. But this time around, it’s a double bonanza for the middle class! With FM Nirmala Sitharaman having announced NIL income tax up to Rs 12 lakh income levels in Budget 2025, the relief in loan EMIs is the cherry on the cake.Experts say that come April 1, 2025, middle class and common man will enjoy the twin benefits of changes in income tax slabs and rates and lower EMIs.So how much will you save on EMIs? What does the income tax relief + lower EMIs combination mean for middle class monthly savings? And, importantly, when will your loan EMIs start coming down? We take a look:According to loan EMI calculations provided by BASIC Home Loan, an individual with a home loan amount of Rs 50 lakh and paying a current interest rate of 8.75% for a 30 year loan will see a reduction of around Rs 889/- per month in the EMI. The EMI amount will go down from Rs 39,335/- to Rs 38,446/-Also Read | Income Tax Slabs FY 2025-26 explained: 20 FAQs individual taxpayers should check to understand tax rates, income tax benefit under new tax regime The biggest takeaway for the middle class is the combined bonanza from income tax slab and rate changes under the new income tax regime and the prospect of lower EMIs in the coming months. In an analysis BankBazaar explains this better:“A salaried person with a gross income of Rs 25 lakh and a home loan of Rs 50 lakh (20 years, 9%, 12 EMIs paid by March), can hope to save a total of Rs 1.37 lakh in FY 2025-26. This will be through a combination of interest savings on the home loan rate reduction of 25 basis points and the tax savings from higher tax slabs from April 1,” says Adhil Shetty, CEO of BankBazaar.The analysis suggests that an individual under the new income tax regime with a gross salary of Rs 25 lakh will now possibly save up to Rs 11,461/- per month with the changes in income tax slabs, rates and the reduced interest rate on loan. This benefit could go up to Rs 13.389/- per month for an individual earning a gross salary of Rs 50 lakh.According to Vivek Iyer, Partner and Financial Services Risk Leader at Grant Thornton Bharat, the repo rate cut transmission will take about 3 to 4 months. “It may not be transmitted in full as banks would need to transmit it only to borrowers whose credit standing is good and hence on an overall portfolio basis it may vary from bank to bank,” Iyer told TOI.Also Read | Budget 2025 Income Tax calculator explained: Save up to Rs 1.1 lakh! How income tax slab changes will benefit taxpayers at different salary levels under new regime Atul Monga, Co-Founder and CEO, BASIC Home Loan also says that it will take some time for the repo rate cut relief to trickle down to loan borrowers.“The MPC’s decision to reduce the policy rate by 25 basis points to 6.25% is a strategic move to fuel economic growth by making borrowing more affordable. Both existing and new borrowers under floating rate loans stand to benefit from lower interest rates, improving loan affordability and accessibility. Fixed rate loan borrowers will remain unaffected from the rate cut,” Monga told TOI.“That said, banks and housing finance companies may take some time to fully transmit the benefits of this rate cut to borrowers, depending on their policies and rate cycle. Lenders have to reset their external benchmark lending rates at least once in 3 months. Borrowers will see benefits once the lenders resets their benchmark rates, which can vary depending on the lender and customer profile,” he explains.Also Read | Latest income tax slabs 2025-26: How much tax do individuals earning slightly above Rs 12 lakh have to pay? Marginal relief calculations explained","For a Rs 1 crore loan at current interest rate of 8.75%, the EMI will come down from Rs 84,450 to Rs 82,630. For a Rs 50 lakh loan at a 9.55% interest rate, the E MI will come out to Rs 41,315. The cut will take effect from April 1.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118010397,imgsize-101606,width-400,resizemode-4/118010397.jpg"

President of India, have received a report from the Governor of the State of Manipur and after considering the report and other information received by me, I am satisfied that a situation has arisen in which the Government of that State cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution of India,"" the notification released by the MHA read."" Now, therefore, in exercise of the powers conferred by article 356 of the Constitution. and of all other powers enabling me in that behalf, I hereby proclaim that I —(a) assume to myself as President of India all functions of the Government of the State of Manipur and all powers vested in or exercisable by the Governor of the that State,"" the notification further added.President’s Rule, imposed under Article 356 of the Indian Constitution, allows the Centre to take control when a state government fails to function constitutionally. Under this rule, state powers are transferred to the Centre, and legislative functions shift to Parliament, though high courts remain unaffected. Since 1950, President’s Rule has been imposed 134 times across 29 states and Union Territories. Manipur and Uttar Pradesh have seen it most frequently, while Jammu & Kashmir holds the record for the longest duration, over 12 years.On Sunday, Biren Singh had submitted his resignation letter to Governor Ajay Kumar Bhalla at the Raj Bhavan in Imphal. Singh, who headed the BJP government in the state, stepped down following ongoing political developments, and violence in the state.The ethnic violence that erupted in 2023 between the Meitei community and Kuki-Zo tribes resulted in over 250 deaths and mass displacement. Manipur's inability to control the unrest raised concerns about CM Singh's leadership. In December 2024, Singh had publicly apologised for the violence and called for reconciliation, urging communities to forgive past mistakes and rebuild peace in the state.Congress had strongly criticised resignation of Biren Singh, accusing him of instigating division in the state. Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi blamed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for allowing Singh to remain in office despite growing unrest. Gandhi said that Singh’s resignation came after mounting public pressure, a Supreme Court investigation, and a planned no-confidence motion by Congress.Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh claimed Singh resigned due to the impending no-confidence motion, asserting that he no longer had majority support. Mallikarjun Kharge condemned the delayed resignation, stating it came ""after the horse had bolted"". Kharge also urged Modi to visit Manipur and hear the people's ""stories of horror.""","President’s Rule, imposed under Article 356 of the Indian Constitution, allows the Centre to take control when a state government fails to function constitutionally.

NEW DELHI: The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has taken cognisance of the disturbing ragging incident at the Government Nursing College in Kottayam, Kerala, calling it “morally reprehensible” and a “severe violation of human rights.” The panel has sought a detailed action taken report from the Kerala Director General of Police (DGP) within ten days.Visuals that surfaced on Thursday showed a junior student tied to a cot, his body repeatedly pierced with a compass while being taunted and mocked by senior students. According to police, the victim was subjected to horrifying acts, including having dumbbells placed on his private parts and facial cream poured into his mouth.The NHRC, citing a complaint, noted that students from Wayanad, Malappuram, and Kottayam were involved in coercing juniors into transferring money and subjecting them to both physical and mental torture. The complaint also alleged that one student was threatened with a knife to his neck while others were bound and inflicted with sharp weapon wounds.“These actions are not only morally reprehensible but also illegal,” the NHRC observed in its proceedings, accessed by PTI.Following a complaint from one victim, five senior students—Samuel Johnson (20), Rahul Raj (22), Jeev (18), Rijil Jith (20), and Vivek (21)—were arrested and remanded to judicial custody. Police suspect there may be more victims and are recording statements to determine the extent of the abuse.The accused have been booked under the Prohibition of Ragging Act and sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), 2023, including those related to causing hurt with dangerous weapons, extortion, and criminal intimidation.Student organizations across Kerala condemned the incident. The Students' Federation of India (SFI) called it shocking, while the Kerala Students' Union (KSU) emphasized that such brutalities should not be shielded. The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) has filed complaints with the Kerala Governor, the NHRC, and the Vice-Chancellor of Kerala University of Health Sciences (KUHS), demanding a thorough inquiry.College authorities claimed they had not received complaints before February 11, with Acting Principal Dr. Sulekha A.T. stating that immediate action was taken once they were informed. The accused students have been suspended, and the college has pledged full cooperation with the legal proceedings.With the NHRC stepping in and police expanding their investigation, the case has intensified pressure on authorities to ensure justice for the victim and stricter enforcement against ragging in educational institutions.","The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has taken cognisance of the disturbing ragging incident at the Government Nursing College in Kottayam, Kerala.

'Talk to your partners about Kangana's bungalow demolition': Nirmala Sitharaman fires back at Jaya Bachchan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/talk-to-your-partners-about-kanganas-bungalow-demolition-nirmala-sitharaman-fires-back-at-jaya-bachchan/articleshow/118222132.cms,"NEW DELHI: Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman hit back at Samajwadi Party MP Jaya Bachchan ’s criticism of the government’s handling of the film industry.Responding to Bachchan’s plea for relief measures, Sitharaman clarified that entertainment tax falls under state jurisdiction and not the Centre’s purview. “Jaya Bachchan ji, honourable member, spoke passionately about how the film industry is being neglected. She said leave aside the GST, all single-screen theatres are shutting down, and there is no cut in entertainment tax. I want to clarify—there is no entertainment tax levied by the Union government,” Sitharaman said.She explained that before the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), states levied entertainment taxes as high as 100%, whereas under the GST regime, movie tickets above Rs 100 are now taxed at 18%, down from 28%. “For tickets below Rs 100, GST has been reduced from 18% to just 12%. Food and beverages inside theatres attract only 5% GST, including the ‘notorious’ popcorn,” she remarked.Bachchan had accused the government of using the film industry for its own benefit while failing to provide any support. “You have totally ignored the film and entertainment industry because you only use them for serving your own purpose,” she said in the Rajya Sabha. She alleged that the government wanted to “kill the industry,” urging Sitharaman to have “mercy” on it.In a sharp rebuttal, Sitharaman pointed to significant government initiatives supporting the media and entertainment sector, including India hosting the first-ever World Audio Visual Entertainment Summit (WAVES 2025) in Mumbai. She also mentioned the recent approval of a National Centre for Excellence for Animation, Visual Effects, Gaming, Comics, and Extended Reality.Highlighting historical incidents of suppression in the film industry, Sitharaman reminded Bachchan of how the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in 2020 had targeted Kangana Ranaut. “Her office was demolished within 24 hours until the Bombay High Court intervened. Jaya Bachchan ji must speak to her alliance partners about that,” she said.She further pointed out that Hridaynath Mangeshkar, the brother of Lata Mangeshkar, was fired from All India Radio because one of his compositions displeased the Congress government. She recalled that celebrated lyricist Majrooh Sultanpuri was jailed, Dev Anand was threatened for opposing the Emergency, and Kishore Kumar’s songs were banned from All India Radio.“We have not forgotten the film industry. On the contrary, we are lifting it to a global level,” she asserted, adding that Prime Minister Modi has honoured cinematic legends in his ‘Mann Ki Baat’ address.","Bachchan had accused the government of using the film industry for its own benefit while failing to provide any support.

NEW DELHI: In a significant diplomatic engagement, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will meet with US President Donald Trump today, marking one of the earliest high-level interactions of the Trump administration . Congress MP Shashi Tharoor emphasized the importance of this meeting, highlighting its strategic implications for India-US relations.""It's fairly significant that our Prime Minister is one of the first world leaders to meet President Trump. That's a good sign,"" Tharoor said. ""If I am not mistaken, he is the fourth head of government to arrive in Washington, and the Trump administration is not even one month old. So this is a very significant thing.""While the specific agenda of the talks remains undisclosed, Tharoor underscored key issues that India would likely prioritize. ""There are trade issues with Trump talking about tariffs. There are issues to do with the H-1B visas for legal Indian immigration. There are issues concerning the manner in which illegal immigrants were sent back and treated in very inhumane ways. That will also have to be addressed.""Tharoor also pointed to global geopolitical concerns that could feature in the discussions. ""There may be some conversations, who knows, on Ukraine. PM Modi has been to both Ukraine and Russia. President Trump took an initiative today with both countries. So there are a lot of issues. It is difficult for us to sit here and guess what they might discuss. I think we should wait for the readout.""Reflecting on India's growing role in global alliances, Tharoor noted, ""There is, for example, the development of the Quad that may come up. India is supposed to be hosting a Quad summit. Where will that go? Will Trump agree to come to India? So many issues.

JAMMU/HAZARIBAG: Two weddings that were never meant to be. Two soldiers who gave their tomorrows so others could have theirs.In two different homes, one in Jharkhand’s Hazaribag and the other in Samba district of Jammu and Kashmir, families were preparing for April — the month when their sons, both soldiers, would become grooms. The houses were being painted, the invitations were being finalised, and dreams of a new beginning were taking shape. But fate had a cruel twist in store.Captain Karamjit Singh Bakshi , 27, and Naik Mukesh Singh Manhas , 29, were on patrol when terrorists struck near the LoC in Jammu’s Akhnoor sector Tuesday afternoon. An IED blast took them away — two young lives, two unfinished stories, two weddings that would never be.In Hazaribag, Captain Karamjit’s family was caught between anticipation and grief. Just 10 days ago, their son had visited them and broke the news of his engagement to a doctor from Army Medical Corps. April 5 was to be the beginning of his new life.His father Sardar Ajinder Singh Bakshi, a restaurateur, had been overseeing the house repairs. His mother Neelu Bakshi had begun setting aside things for the wedding. Karamjit was their only son.Now, instead of wedding guests, mourners would arrive. Instead of a bride’s entry, a tricolour-draped coffin would return home Thursday night.“He had only been in the Army for five years,” said his uncle Sardar Devinder Singh. “He had so much ahead of him.” Karmajit was attached to Punjab Regimental Centre.Far away in the border village of Bri Kamila in Samba, another family had been preparing for celebration. Naik Mukesh had spent his last holiday putting the final touches on his newly built home — meant for the wife he would bring in April. He had left on Jan 28, his wedding date nearly set for April 20-21.His father Chagatar Singh, a retired policeman, held onto memories of a son who had served more than a decade, braving the icy winds of Siachen, the turmoil of Kashmir, the vigilance of Punjab. “Youngsters in the village looked up to Mukesh,” he said. “He encouraged them to play sports, even gave them cricket and volleyball kits.”Mukesh had joined the Army in 2014 and his younger brother, also in the military, had always looked up to him. Now, the tradition of service in their village had come at an unbearable price.“Almost every home here has sent its son to the armed forces,” said villager Mukhtar Singh. “It has become a tradition.”But some sacrifices are heavier than others. In two households, wedding cards will remain undelivered. The ceremonial turbans will stay folded. The brides, once waiting in anticipation, are now bound to grief.","Captain Karamjit Singh Bakshi, 27, and Naik Mukesh Singh Manhas, 29, were on patrol when terrorists struck near the LoC in Jammu’s Akhnoor sector Tuesday afternoon.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Wednesday ruled that a spouse involved in a void marriage like bigamy is also entitled to seek permanent alimony and maintenance from his or her partner under the Hindu Marriage Act .In view of contradictory judgments delivered on the issue of maintenance of spouse in cases of void marriage, a three-judge bench of Justices Abhay S Oka, Ahsanuddin Amanullah and Augustine George Masih passed the judgment and held that void marriages also come under the ambit of Sections 24 and 25 of Hindu Marriage Act which talks about maintenance and alimony.The marriages are void under 1995 Act: (1) If one or both the parties to the marriage have a spouse living at the time of marriage; (2) The parties to the marriage are within the degrees of prohibited relationship; and (3) The parties are sapindas of each other, unless the custom or usage governing each of them permits of a marriage between the two. A sapinda relationship is based on a common ancestor within three generations on the mother's side and five generations on the father's side.""A spouse whose marriage has been declared void under Section 11 of 1955 Act is entitled to seek permanent alimony or maintenance from the other spouse by invoking Section 25 of the Act. Whether such a relief of permanent alimony can be granted or not always depends on facts of each case and the conduct of the parties. The grant of relief under Section 25 is always discretionary,"" SC said. It held that maintenance could also be granted during litigation.SC passed the order on a plea filed by a man, who submitted that there may be cases where a wife may be responsible for concealing her first marriage and induce the husband to marry. But the bench said the entitlement under Section 25 does not depend on whether the bigamous marriage is moral or immoral.SC took exception to Bombay HC full bench order for using objectionable terms for women involved in void marriage. ""...the full bench has coined the term illegitimate wife. Calling the wife of a marriage declared as void as an illegitimate wife is very inappropriate. It affects the dignity of the concerned woman.""",Supreme Court ruled that a spouse involved in a void marriage like bigamy is also entitled to seek permanent alimony and maintenance from his or her partner.

’s stance on key issues

Concerns over trade, immigration, and climate

Modi’s meeting with Elon Musk also under scrutiny

Modi-Trump talks set against growing bilateral tensions

NEW DELHI: Ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s high-profile meeting with US President Donald Trump, the Congress on Thursday questioned whether he would ""summon up the courage"" to raise India’s concerns over the treatment of deported Indian citizens and other critical issues, including trade, immigration, and climate policies.Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh, in a post on X, posed a series of questions to Modi, urging him to confront Trump on recent deportations. “Will Modi tell Trump that India would send its own aircraft—like Venezuela and Colombia—to bring back deportees in the future?” Ramesh asked.He also criticized the government's concessions to the US, including slashing import duties on farm produce and Harley-Davidson motorcycles, and amending the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damages Act, 2010, to benefit US firms.The Congress leader pressed Modi on whether he would oppose Trump’s policies, including his stance on Palestine and his withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement and the WHO. Ramesh also raised concerns about “racist attacks” on H1B visa holders, the majority of whom are Indians.“Will Mr Modi tell President Trump that attacks on H1B visa holders—over 70% of whom are Indian youth—are unacceptable? H1B visas have benefited both countries,” Ramesh stated.The Congress also questioned Modi’s upcoming meeting with Tesla CEO Elon Musk, asking whether India would insist on Tesla manufacturing in India rather than merely assembling vehicles.“Will Modi uphold his policy of auctioning spectrum instead of administrative allocation, and ensure that security considerations remain non-negotiable for satellite internet providers like Starlink?” Ramesh added.Modi, currently on a two-day visit to Washington, is set to meet Trump in the first bilateral talks of Trump’s second term. The visit comes amid concerns in New Delhi over Trump’s ""America First"" trade policies and immigration stance, as well as recent deportations that sparked outrage in India.The meeting will be closely watched for Modi’s response to these pressing concerns and whether he takes a firm stand on India’s interests.","Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh, in a post on X, posed a series of questions to Modi, urging him to confront Trump on recent deportations.

Out-of-syllabus questions

erode

NTA credibility

further

NEW DELHI: A record 12 JEE-Main questions were dropped from the final answer key due to errors, the highest in recent history, raising serious concerns about the National Testing Agency 's ability to conduct a fair and transparent exam of such a large scale.Despite reducing the total number of questions from 90 to 75, the error rate surged to 1.6%, far exceeding historical 0.6% threshold. Adding to the concern is NTA's lack of transparency, with inconsistencies in its claims about the number of dropped questions, raising suspicions of ""under-reporting"" NTA DG P S Kharola did not respond to TOI questions. Education ministry has forwarded a reply from NTA that ignored syllabus discrepancy concerns, deepening scepticism about its accountability.An examination of past answer keys contradicts NTA's claims, revealing multiple instances of error-free papers in previous years. Before 2025, the highest number of dropped questions was six in Session 1 of 2024 and four in Session 2.NTA claimed that six questions were dropped in Session 1 of 2023, 2024 and 2025, but the official answer key for 2025 lists 12 dropped questions. TOI's analysis found five questions were dropped in Session 1 of 2023, while 2022's Session 1 and 2 had four and six dropped questions, respectively. No questions were dropped in the Feb and March 2021 exams. Despite this, the agency defended itself, stating, ""This year's record-low challenge rate and minimal errors reaffirm NTA's commitment to ensuring a fair, transparent, and error-free examination process for engineering aspirants nationwide.""Experts highlight that inconsistencies in language translations further erode trust in the exam process. At least two translation errors were found in the final answer key, causing confusion. Incorrect answers were later marked correct, creating additional discrepancies. Students answering in Hindi and Gujarati had two answer choices, while others had only one, raising concerns about fairness. The inclusion of out-of-syllabus questions further damaged confidence in NTA's reliability.Educators and students have expressed frustration, stating, ""In a prestigious exam like JEE, where students' futures are at stake, such incompetence is unacceptable."" Errors led to confusion, such as a logic gate question from the 22nd Shift 2 paper being dropped after being deemed invalid. Physics questions also contained errors, while translation inconsistencies and marking mistakes persisted.Despite assurances of a well-structured exam, students encountered multiple out-of-syllabus topics.""For example, the Carnot Cycle, removed from the syllabus years ago, appeared unexpectedly in the paper. Likewise, Newton's Law of Cooling, omitted for the past two years, suddenly had 22 related questions. This misalignment between the syllabus and the actual exam content further added to students' distress,"" an educator lamented, adding, ""we expected a better paper this year - one without errors and irrelevant questions. Instead, we got a complete mess.""Students lost valuable time on incorrectly framed questions, with some spending 10-15 minutes struggling with ambiguous problems, affecting performance and rankings. As one student put it, ""It's not just about dropping incorrect questions - it's about the time students wasted on them. That's a huge injustice.""NTA has faced criticism for mismanaging various exams, including last year's NEET-UG and UGC-NET, which were marred by controversies over paper leak allegations and irregularities. Given past failures, expectations were high for improvements in JEE-Main 2025 . However, despite recommendations from the Radhakrishnan Committee categorising JEE-Main as a high-stakes exam, the agency appears to have repeated its mistakes. The committee stated, "" ...It is to be ensured that questions created will have uncontested answers...

The Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Anil Chauhan on Wednesday raised doubts over China's claims about their sixth-generation fighter aircraft, stating that these aircraft are still under development.CDS Chauhan, when questioned about Chinese sixth-generation fighter jet claims, told news agency ANI that while numerous nations are working on sixth-generation programmes, he personally believes all are considerably far from completion. He suggested that nations might be displaying these technologies as part of their tactical approach.""It's very difficult to see these kinds of platforms with six-generation capability. What we are talking about is by external viewing of an aircraft and that too with a few seconds clip which will not give you an idea that this is six generation aircraft. In fact, a large number of countries are pursuing a six-generation program and that's my personal belief that all of them are some distance away. But sometime back we had heard about the capabilities of WS 10 or WS 15 engines which are there on 5th generation aircraft for the Chinese,"" General Chauhan said.""Sometime back, we had also heard about Chinese hiring a number of ex-pilots of the American and the British Air Force. They wanted to refine their drills and their systems, so they just show that they're still in that kind of a development stage. Not only as far as technology is concerned, but also tactics is concerned. So we are there. We have a program for AMCA that's a 5th generation fighter, so that's somewhere down the line. But we are there,"" he added.Additionally, General Chauhan explained his perspective on sixth-generation aircraft, describing it as a platform capable of both manned and unmanned operations .""My understanding of a sixth generation aircraft is that there is no proper globally accepted definition of what a sixth generation aircraft is. Basically, a sixth generation aircraft is a platform which can perform both manned and unmanned teaming. It is kind of an aerial command post which can take control of 2-3 similar kinds of assets, maybe UAVs, maybe drones which are sound drones and then put a combat in a different kind of a manner,"" he said.CDS Chauhan said that such aircraft would incorporate various technologies, including networks, data analytics and artificial intelligence to enhance the pilot's decision-making capabilities during combat situations.""So that's the kind of concept of six-generation and it involves number of technologies. It will involve networks, data analytics which will provide that kind of situation awareness to that pilot over there and also command and control of all the assets. He should be able to network himself or spar passage of information through terrestrial or say aerial networks. It will also use artificial intelligence to give him that better decision making ability during combat. It also will have maybe long range smart air-to-air missiles, weapon systems and apart from that stealth technology with self-healing kind of capabilities,"" he concluded.","Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Anil Chauhan raised doubts over China's claims about their sixth-generation fighter aircraft.

NEW DELHI: India has improved its Climate Risk Index (CRI) rank from seventh worst affected country globally due to extreme weather events in 2019 to 49th in 2022. However, historically it remains among the top 10 most affected ones by figuring as the sixth worst in long-term (1993-2022) assessment.The findings are part of the CRI 2025, released by environmental think tank Germanwatch Wednesday, that analysed six indicators including fatalities and economic loss due to extreme weather events reported in the countries during 1993-2022.The report shows that India reported loss of 80,000 lives and nearly $180 billion in 400 extreme weather events in 30 years (1993-2022).Globally, over 7,65,000 people lost their lives due to more than 9,400 extreme weather events in the 30 years until 2022. It caused economic damages totaling $4.2 trillion (inflation-adjusted). Storms (35%), heat waves (30%) and floods (27%) caused the most fatalities during 1993-2022.The report, highlighting the consequences of globally increasing climate risks, shows seven of the 10 most affected countries in 2022 belonged to the high-income country group. ""This clearly indicates that, while the coping capacities of high-income countries significantly exceed those of lower-income countries, higher-income countries should also increase their climate risk management,"" the report said.Italy, Spain and Greece are the three EU nations which are among the 10 most affected countries worldwide over the past three decades. Dominica, China, Honduras, Myanmar and Italy are the top five most affected in the list of 1993-2022.The report comes days after WEF ranked extreme weather events amplified by climate change as the second most considerable global risk after armed conflict and war.Referring to India, the report underlined that the country experienced devastating floods in 1993, 1998, and 2013, along with severe heat waves in 2002, 2003, and 2015. The country shows high absolute fatalities and economic losses, as well as high absolute and relative numbers of people affected during 1993-2022.Notable events from India in the report include 1998 Gujarat and 1999 Odisha cyclones; cyclones Hudhud and Amphan in 2014 and 2020, respectively; 1993 floods in northern India, Uttarakhand floods of 2013, and severe floods in 2019. ""Recurring and unusually intense heat waves, all with temperatures around 50 degree C, claimed many lives in 1998, 2002, 2003, and 2015,"" it said.","India has improved its Climate Risk Index (CRI) rank from seventh worst affected country globally due to extreme weather events in 2019 to 49th in 2022. However, historically it remains among the top 10 most affected ones by figuring as the sixth worst in long-term (1993-2022) assessment.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118230437,imgsize-139496,width-400,resizemode-4/118230437.jpg"

We're also paving the way to ultimately provide India with the F-35 stealth fighters ,” he said.Trump also highlighted his strong rapport with PM Modi, calling him a “much tougher negotiator” and noting the “special bond” between their nations.The two leaders reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening trade and defence relations, even as Trump maintained his hard stance on economic issues with much of the world.If the F-35 stealth fighter deal goes through, India will join an exclusive group of countries—including NATO allies, Israel, and Japan—that operate the cutting-edge aircraft.Beyond military agreements, trade discussions took centre stage. Trump, who has long criticised India’s tariffs, reiterated his concerns, calling them “unfair” and “very strong.” Earlier in the day, he announced new reciprocal tariffs on all countries, including India, raising uncertainty over future trade ties. However, PM Modi struck a more optimistic tone, saying both sides would work towards a “mutually beneficial trade agreement” focusing on oil and gas. Trump also highlighted broader economic collaboration, stating that the two countries planned to invest in infrastructure projects, including ports, railways, and undersea cables, as part of a trade route linking India to Israel and Europe.Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk also joined Trump’s discussions with PM Modi. The newly appointed DOGE head, who has taken on an influential role in the administration, also held a private meeting with the Indian leader, raising questions about whether he was acting in an official or business capacity. Modi later shared photos of their meeting, showing a Musk alongside Indian officials.The visit also touched on immigration policies. India recently accepted a US military flight carrying 100 shackled migrants as part of Trump’s immigration crackdown, sparking criticism from Indian opposition leaders. However, PM Modi defended the decision, stating that undocumented Indians in the US were being exploited by human traffickers. “Any verified Indian who is in the US illegally, we are fully prepared to take them back to India,” he said.In return, Trump announced that the US would extradite Tahawwur Hussain Rana, a suspect linked to the deadly 2008 Mumbai attacks. Calling him “one of the very evil people in the world,” Trump confirmed that the long-pending extradition would proceed after Rana lost his appeal to the US Supreme Court.","US President Donald Trump has announced plans to sell advanced F-35 fighter jets to India.

Prez rule to create a neutral setting for talks in Manipur



NEW DELHI: The Centre Thursday imposed President's rule in Manipur , days after chief minister N Biren Singh stepped down and subsequent efforts at forming an alternative govt remained unsuccessful. The Manipur assembly, however, will remain in suspended animation, leaving room for formation of a govt as and when an alternative emerges.Assembly polls in Manipur, in the normal course, are due Feb 2027.President Droupadi Murmu, in the proclamation imposing President's rule, said she was ""satisfied a situation has arisen in which govt of that state cannot be carried on in accordance with provisions of the Constitution of India"".The proclamation, sources said, was issued under Rule 12 of the Government of India (Transaction of Business) Rules, 1961, which allows the PM in emergency situations to depart from the requirement to get the Union Cabinet to make the recommendation for application of Article 356. With PM Narendra Modi away in the US, a meeting of the cabinet could not have been convened. Post-facto approval can be taken from the cabinet on the PM's return.There have been precedents of Rule 12 being applied with regard to President's rule in a state; the last time this was done was to revoke President's rule in Maharashtra in Nov 2019.The proclamation is likely to be placed before Parliament in the current session, when it meets post-recess, unless an alternative emerges in the interim, allowing President's rule to be revoked.While the BJP leadership appeared to be making efforts to pick a successor to Singh, it was reconciled to the prospect of the state having to be put, at least temporarily, under central rule. Perhaps, it can be helpful as the state seeks to achieve normalcy that has eluded it since May 2023.There is an assessment that placing Manipur under President’s rule — with governor Ajay Bhalla, a former home secretary who has worked under home minister Amit Shah for five years, in the saddle — almost 21 months after ethnic violence broke out, will help in creating a neutral setting for talks between Meitei and Kuki-Zo leaders to sort out issues creating mutual mistrust. Kukis, who had been resisting sitting across the table with Singh in the lead, are expected to soften their stance and come forward for substantive talks to bring lasting peace.The fast-paced political developments in Manipur come amid the assessment that Singh’s own support among MLAs and Manipuri people had dwindled over time. There is a sense that people of the state, both from Meitei-dominated Valley and hills occupied by Kuki-Zo, are tired of the prolonged conflict and failure of Biren Singh govt to curb it and now want a decisive leadership to broker peace.","President Droupadi Murmu said she was ""satisfied a situation has arisen in which govt of that state cannot be carried on in accordance with provisions of the Constitution of India"" The Manipur assembly, however, will remain in suspended animation, leaving room for formation of a govt as and when an alternative emerges.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118230202,imgsize-38662,width-400,resizemode-4/118230202.jpg"

SC sets aside ‘casual and cavalier’ bail order of HC



NEW DELHI: Observing that the offence of money laundering posed serious threat not only to the financial systems of the country but also to its integrity and sovereignty and could not be regarded as an ordinary crime, Supreme Court on Thursday said courts should refrain from taking a casual or cursory approach while granting bail as it should be given only when the twin conditions under PMLA are fulfilled.A bench of Justices Bela M Trivedi and Prasanna B Varale said the burden was on the accused to prove that he was not involved in generating proceeds of crime . The bench set aside the order of Patna high court granting bail to an accused and directed him to surrender.The apex court’s order is significant as it comes against the backdrop of a series of orders by different courts seeking to extend “bail is the norm, jail an exception” principle to PMLA cases.Section 45 (of PMLA) imposes two conditions for grant of bail to any person accused of an offence punishable for a term of imprisonment of more than three years under Part A of the Schedule. The two conditions are that (i) the prosecutor must be given an opportunity to oppose the application for bail; and (ii) the court must be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accused person is not guilty of such offence and that he is not liable to commit any offence while on bail. As well settled, these two conditions are mandatory in nature and they need to be complied with before the accused person is released on bail,” the bench said.Setting aside the bail order, the bench said HC passed the order in a “very casual and cavalier manner”, without considering the rigours of Section 45 and there was no finding that there were reasonable grounds for believing that the respondent was not guilty of the alleged offence under the Act and that he was not likely to commit any offence while on bail.“The offence of money laundering is not an ordinary offence. It has been regarded as an aggravated form of crime world over and the offenders involved connected with the proceeds of crime are treated as a separate class from ordinary criminals. Any casual or cursory approach by courts while considering the bail application of the offender and granting him bail by passing cryptic orders without considering the seriousness of the crime and without considering the rigours of Section 45 cannot be vindicated,” the bench said.“It is a very serious offence which is committed by an individual with a deliberate desire and the motive to enhance his gains, disregard ing the interest of the nation and the society as a whole, and such offence by no stretch of imagination can be regarded as an offence of trivial nature. The stringent provisions have been made in the Act to combat the menace of money laundering,” it added.The bench said Section 24 provides that in case a person is charged with the offence of money laundering, the authority or court shall, unless the contrary is proved, presume that such proceeds of crime are involved in money laundering. “Therefore, the burden to prove that proceeds of crime are not involved in money laundering would lie on the person charged with the offence,” the bench said.In this case, accused Kanhaiya Prasad , who is the son of politician Radha Charan Sah, was arrested in Sept 2023 and was granted bail by HC in May 2024. As per ED, both father and son were involved in illegal sand mining in Bihar.",SC sets aside ‘casual and cavalier’ bail order of HC in money laundering case.

Trump prioritises Americans' safety: Officials on Pannun plot

NEW DELHI: President Donald Trump prioritises nothing more than the safety of every American, said senior Trump administration officials in first remarks on the foiled murder-for-hire plot against US national and India-designated terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun . The Biden administration had indicted an Indian govt official for orchestrating the plot, forcing Indian authorities to launch a probe in the case.""I can tell you President Trump, you've seen this in recent days, with respect to the persons we've brought home, he prioritises nothing more than the safety of every American, and that is the continued position of this administration,"" said a senior official when asked if Trump was going to raise the issue in his meeting with PM Narendra Modi.The remarks came in a background media briefing, in which White House officials also underscored the perception of India-US ties as among the most critical partnerships of the 21st century and said Trump was going to do his part to ensure that remains the ""foundational element moving forward"". The officials said the countries are moving towards signing a new defence framework and that there's ongoing conversation about a number of new procurements by India that can help reduce the trade deficit. India is expected to agree to more energy and defence purchases from the US in the meeting with Trump.Talking about Trump's agenda with India, they said the US will build on defence sales to India, prioritising the use of American technology and India's status as a key importer of America's natural resources. According to the officials, Trump will seek a fair trade partnership and discuss ways to build up the Quad partnership to promote stability and peace across the Indo-Pacific. Specifically on China, alluding to the previous Trump administration's support for India during the eastern Ladakh standoff, the official said that the president is very proud ""in the summer of 2020"" to have augmented and strengthened the partnership with India, particularly in the border crisis with the Chinese, and that ""portends kind of continued cooperation"".Days before the return of Trump to the White House, the Indian high-level committee probing alleged Indian involvement in the plot against Pannun had filed a report recommending quick legal action against Vikash Yadav, the accused official. India is hoping the matter will be allowed to rest here and will not get the kind of salience it got under the Biden administration.The officials appreciated recent measures by India that could help reduce the trade deficit the US runs with India. ""I anticipate what you'll see coming out of a meeting (Modi-trump) today is further momentum towards a solidified fair, and I emphasise that word fair bilateral trade arrangement between our two dynamic and growing economies, and the hope would be to have such a deal in place in the calendar year 2025,"" said an official, while also expressing support for IMEEC, iCET and I2U2.""Critical technologies partnership between our economies is important to ensure that free societies are leading the way in some of the most important technologies in the future. I expect collaboration will continue with this administration, and you will see some announcements... some of the key areas, semi-conductors, critical minerals, supply chain resilience and diversification, those are good things for our economy and the president certainly believes that too.""",Trump will seek a fair trade partnership and discuss ways to build up the Quad partnership to promote stability and peace across the Indo-Pacific.

"Modi, Macron seal deals on N-energy to power AI",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/modi-macron-seal-deals-on-n-energy-to-power-ai/articleshow/118196236.cms,"PM Modi and French President Emmanuel Macron

India and France adopted a roadmap for cooperation in AI and concluded 9 other agreements, including 3 to boost civil nuclear cooperation, as PM Narendra Modi and President Emmanuel Macron held bilateral talks, reaffirming their strong commitment to the strategic partnership between the 2 countries.Among the major takeaways was an agreement for jointly developing and producing advanced and small modular reactors that could hold the key to powering the energy-intensive AI industry in both countries. The leaders discussed regional and global issues like the West Asia situation and Russia-Ukraine war and enhanced their Indo-Pacific partnership with an agreement for triangular cooperation to promote sustainable development in third countries in the region.While no agreement was signed in defence, Modi and Macron welcomed cooperation in building air and maritime assets in line with the 2024 defence industrial roadmap. In a special gesture, the leaders travelled together in the French presidential aircraft to Marseille where they held delegation-level talks, visited a war cemetery and inaugurated the new Indian consulate. Macron hosted a private dinner for Modi and later also went to the airport in Marseille to see off the Indian PM.Four of the agreements signed were in areas related to technology and innovation. While the leaders didn’t address the media, they acknowledged in a joint statement India-France civil nuclear ties and efforts in cooperation on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, notably in relation with the Jaitapur Nuclear Power Plant Project. They welcomed the partnership for co-designing, co-developing and co-producing advanced modular reactors (AMR) and small modular reactors (SMR). India has been in touch with the US, Russia and France for the past couple of years for jointly developing the technology and the issue is likely to figure in Modi’s engagements in the US too on Thursday. Foreign secretary Vikram Misri said cooperation in SMR and AMR is important also for AI, recalling International Energy Agency chief Fatih Birol’s remark that AI essentially means electricity. “And the amount of electricity that will be needed, if it is going to be sustainable, then it has to be something like nuclear power-driven electricity. And that is the area in which SMRs and AMRs can play a key role. It can also help us tackle complications in conventional projects,’’ said Misri.The leaders also agreed to work closely on implementing the India-Middle East-Europe Corridor (IMEEC) initiative, stressing its importance for connectivity, sustainable growth and access to clean energy. In this regard, they acknowledged the strategic location of Marseille in the Mediterranean Sea, said the joint statement.The leaders also underlined their common commitment to a free, open, inclusive, secure and peaceful Indo-Pacific region, where France is a resident power. On trilateral cooperation in the region, Misri said the choice of projects will be driven by host countries. “These are demand-driven initiatives and not supply-driven initiatives. And we feel that it is important for us to provide choices to countries, amongst our partners, with regard to development cooperation pathways. And I think India and France have a certain alignment in their thinking about this kind of cooperation,’’ he said.There was focus also on skill development and vocational education as the leaders welcomed the operationalization of the Young Professionals Scheme (YPS), under India-France Migration and Mobility Partnership Agreement (MMPA), which is expected to facilitate two way mobility of youth and professionals,France reiterated its firm support for India’s permanent membership of the UN Security Council as Modi and Macron emphasised the urgent need for the reform of the Council. “The two leaders agreed to strengthen conversations on regulation of use of the veto in case of mass atrocities. They held extensive discussions on long-term global challenges and current international developments and agreed to intensify their global and regional engagement, including through multilateral initiatives and institutions,’’ said the joint statement.France joined India in unequivocally condemning all forms of terrorism including, importantly for India, cross-border terrorism and called for the disruption of terrorism financing networks and safe havens. “They further agreed that no country should provide safe haven to those who finance, plan, support, or commit terrorist acts. The leaders also called for concerted action against all terrorists, including through designations of individuals affiliated with groups that are listed by the UN Security Council 1267 Sanctions Committee,’’ said the joint statement.","India and France adopted a roadmap for cooperation in AI and concluded 9 other agreements, including 3 to boost civil nuclear cooperation.

Deion Sanders demonstrates reasons for rejecting NFL offers and establishing a Hall of Fame coaching staff at Colorado,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/deion-sanders-demonstrates-reasons-for-rejecting-nfl-offers-and-establishing-a-hall-of-fame-coaching-staff-at-colorado/articleshow/118200044.cms,"Image via AP

Deion Sanders prioritizes coaching sons Shedeur Sander and Shilo Sander at Colorado

Deion Sanders prefers coaching college athletes over the NFL to mentor them beyond football. He’s built a strong Colorado staff, adding Hall of Famers Marshall Faulk and Warren Sapp to develop players on and off the field.Deion Sanders stayed committed to Colorado despite reported interest from NFL teams like the Dallas Cowboys and Las Vegas Raiders. He had stated he’d only consider the NFL if he could coach his sons, Shedeur Sanders and Shilo Sanders. Shedeur is a top QB prospect for the 2025 draft, projected as a top-five pick, while Shilo is expected to be a late-round selection.Colorado’s season ended in disappointment with a 36-14 loss to BYU in the Alamo Bowl, but their nine wins marked the program’s best season in nearly a decade. However, their bowl game victory drought extended to 21 years.Despite the loss, Colorado’s top stars,Heisman winner Travis Hunter and quarterback Shedeur Sanders remain highly regarded, with their draft stock unaffected. With both players heading to the NFL, Deion Sanders faces the challenge of maintaining momentum next season. He’s already making moves, recruiting new talent, and reportedly adding another Hall of Fame coach to his staff to keep Colorado competitive.Deion Sanders is reshaping his coaching staff, adding Hall of Famer Marshall Faulk as Colorado’s new running backs coach. Faulk, a former NFL MVP, Super Bowl champion, and seven-time Pro Bowler, joins fellow Hall of Famer Warren Sapp on Sanders’ staff.Faulk’s arrival signals a potential shift in Colorado’s offense. With Shedeur Sanders and Travis Hunter heading to the NFL, Sanders may move away from a pass-heavy attack and focus more on the running game, which has struggled under his leadership. In 2024, Colorado’s running backs combined for just 847 yards and 15 touchdowns, with four of those scores coming from Shedeur. Faulk’s experience and leadership are expected to help strengthen this weak spot and bring more balance to the offense next season.Marshall Faulk, a Hall of Famer with 12,279 rushing yards in his NFL career, is a major addition to Colorado's coaching staff. Known for his ability to both run and catch, Faulk will be a key figure in developing Colorado's running backs like Isaiah Augustave, Micah Welch, Dallan Hayden, and Drelon Miller.""Deion is an elevator,"" Faulk said before the Super Bowl. ""He's going to elevate you as a person, and he's going to force you to elevate your life. That's what it does. He lifts people up.""This move fits perfectly with Deion Sanders’ philosophy of bringing in coaches with elite playing experience. Just as Warren Sapp has helped improve the defensive line, Faulk’s presence could have a similar impact on the running back group, potentially transforming the offense and giving it more balance.Marshall Faulk will earn $400,000 in his first year as Colorado’s running backs coach, with a base salary of $300,000 and an extra $100,000 for community outreach. His salary is expected to rise in his second year, but his real value comes from his experience as both a rusher and receiver, which could bring a new dimension to Colorado’s offense.Also Read: “I think he retires”: Colin Cowherd believes Travis Kelce have played the last game of his career against the Eagles at the Super Bowl LIX With Faulk joining Warren Sapp under Deion Sanders, Colorado is setting a new standard in college football by bringing in Hall of Fame-level talent to coach. This could pave the way for other former NFL stars to follow suit, as seen with the surprising hiring of Bill Belichick at North Carolina. It could signal a shift in how college football is shaped, with more NFL legends looking to make an impact on the next generation of players.","Deion Sanders has added Hall of Famer Marshall Faulk to his coaching staff.

The New York Jets Have Finally Made Up Its Mind About Aaron Rodgers’ Future,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/the-new-york-jets-have-finally-made-up-its-mind-about-aaron-rodgers-future/articleshow/118224436.cms,"Aaron Rodgers is not returning to the Jets. Source: Getty

It’s Official: Aaron Rodgers is Not Returning To The Jets. Here’s How Much It Will Cost The Team

Aaron Rodgers ' chaotic two-year stint with the New York Jets is over as the team announced they were moving in another direction. The 41-year-old quarterback has played for 20 seasons and has notably not yet announced whether he intends to play a 21 season. However, he has not announced his retirement so it’s unlikely that he wants to hang up his cleats.It’s no secret that the four-time MVP is only the fifth player in NFL history to throw 500 touchdown passes in the regular season. But Rodgers had a rather underwhelming 2024 season in terms of numbers, completing 368 passes out of 584 attempts for 3,897 yards, with 28 touchdown passes and 11 interceptions. Though these are not bad stats, they do not align with the aspirations of a team expecting to reach playoffs.In a joint statement issued by the team, Mougey and Glenn said they met with Rodgers last week and informed him ""that our intention was to move in a different direction at quarterback.""""It was important to have this discussion now to provide clarity and enable each of us the proper time to plan for our respective futures,"" Mougey and Glenn said in the statement. ""We want to thank him for the leadership, passion, and dedication he brought to the organisation and wish him success moving forward.""A few days ago, it was reported that Glenn reportedly had some clear demands for Aaron’s return. According to sports journalist Dianna Russini, the franchise was open to him returning, but Glenn wanted full involvement in the offseason and, notably, a step back from his media appearances, including his recurring appearance on the The Pat McAfee Show where Rodgers has revealed some details which may have made the team brass uncomfortable.Rodgers has one year left on his contract, worth a non-guaranteed $US37.5 million ($A59.8 million). Jets would absorb a $US49 million dead money charge next season when they eventually release Rodgers. They can take the full hit this year or, more likely, designate him as a post-June 1 cut and spread out that charge over two years.If the Jets do that, Rodgers would remain on their roster — while carrying a $US23.5 ($A37.5) salary cap charge — until the start of the NFL's new league year on March 12. As per Adam Schefter, “As a 6/1 cut, they’d carry his $23.5M cap hit until June 1, when it drops to $14M—saving $9.5M. However, they’d then absorb a $35M cap hit in 2026.”","Aaron Rodgers is not returning to the New York Jets.

Steelers Have No Plans of Losing Trevor Lawrence, As Per Reports

The conclusion of the Super Bowl also marks the beginning of staffing changes for the NFL’s coaching teams. However, there are plenty of rumours swirling about which may not be true and could be pure speculation or even fan theories. As per sports journalist Ryan Burr who works for the Big 10 Network, Pittsburgh Steelers have made enquiries about Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence . However, a senior Steelers source has denied this rumour.Burr had tweeted on X, “Steelers have made inquiries to the [Jaguars] about a trade for QB Trevor Lawerence. This directly from the horses mouth in the Jags organization. WOW!” But a more recent news report has said that this is not true. A senior Steelers source has reportedly told the press, “There has never been nor was there at any time, implied or directly, any imposition about Trevor Lawrence.""I am certain that any official with the Jacksonville Jaguars would confirm this,"" the source added. ""Simply not true.""Moreover, a Jaguars source has also revealed that these rumours are ""laughable."" This news did seem unlikely since Lawrence is likely to stick with Jacksonville this season. Lawrence is entering his fifth year in the NFL and signed a five-year, $275 million contract with the Jaguars last offseason.In four years he has managed to bag a 22-38 record with 13,815 passing yards, 69 touchdowns and 46 interceptions and also helped Jaguars beat the Los Angeles Chargers to go further in the Divisional Round. However, they were eliminated by the Kansas City Chiefs.Steelers on the other hand are reportedly looking to retain Justin Fields but have had conversations about Aaron Rodgers , who will be released by the New York Jets. The team can also consider Russell Wilson who will be a free agent soon.","Trevor Lawrence has no plans of switching teams, according to a senior Steelers source.

What Does Chiefs GM Think About Travis Kelce’s Possible Retirement?

Post Kansas City Chiefs’ disappointing Super Bowl loss, rumours have been buzzing about tight end Travis Kelce ’s retirement. The Chiefs have just new a tight end, Anthony Firkser and news of this was dropped hours after Kelce talked about his potential retirement in his podcast New Heights. And Chiefs general manager Brett Veach hinted at Kelce’s last season a few hours before the Super Bowl.“I think we’ve all seen it over the last few years,” Veach said. “There’s a period throughout the season you’re like, ‘Ah, might be it.’”In the aftermath of the 40-22 Super Bowl score, the future of a seasoned tight end like Kelce has arrived at a crucial juncture, especially with all the roster changes. 2024 was rather underwhelming for Kelce and saw him post his lowest yards. He also registered just 8.5 yards per reception in 2024 and analysts have suggested that age might be slowing Kelce down.Kelce himself talked about retirement in a recent episode of his podcast. “I know everybody wants to know whether or not I’m playing next year. And right now, I’m just kicking everything down the road,” Kelce said on the “New Heights with Jason & Travis” podcast. “I’m kicking every can I can down the road. And I’m not making any crazy decisions, but I right now, the biggest thing is just being there for my teammates and being there for my coaches, understanding that there’s a lot that goes into this thing.”“I’ve been fortunate over the past five, six years, I’ve played more football than anybody. And it’s because the people that are in that building and the fact that we keep going to these AFC championships and these Super Bowls, and that means I’m playing an extra three games more than everybody else in the entire league. And that’s a lot of wear and tear on your body,” he added.It’s safe to say Kelce has already begun exploring his options in the entertainment industry and it may not have anything to do with the fact that he’s dating the biggest pop star in the world right now, Taylor Swift. He has hosted an episode of Saturday Night Live and has appeared in numerous commercials and acted in projects like ‘Grotesquerie’ and the upcoming ‘Happy Gilmore’ sequel. His brother Jason already earns a decent paycheck as a broadcaster and it won’t be surprising if Travis too follows in his footsteps.Sports journalist Jimmy Traina recently broke down why retirement won’t possibly affect Kelce financially as several networks and platforms may be vying to sign him. ""If the future Hall of Famer isn’t motivated to play and calls it quits, he will be the subject of one of the most intense bidding wars that we’ve ever seen in sports television,"" Traina shared. ""...Given Travis' popularity and [relationship with entertainment superstar Taylor Swift], it wouldn’t be hard to see him get close to $10M per year for his services.""","Travis Kelce talked about his potential retirement in his podcast New Heights.

Thomson Reuters wins AI copyright battle in US against Ross Intelligence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/thomson-reuters-wins-ai-copyright-battle-in-us-against-ross-intelligence/articleshow/118231116.cms,"Thomson Reuters has secured an early legal victory in the ongoing debate over fair use in AI-related copyright cases. The media and technology company sued Ross Intelligence—a now-defunct legal research firm—in 2020, alleging that it unlawfully used content from its legal platform, Westlaw, to train an AI model without authorisation.Judge Stephanos Bibas of the 3rd US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled a decision on Tuesday that Ross Intelligence was not entitled to use Thomson Reuters' content under US copyright law to develop a competing platform.According to the Associated Press, Bibas, in the summary judgment, concluded that ""none of Ross's possible defenses holds water"" and ruled in Reuters' favour regarding the ""fair use"" matter.Under US law, the ""fair use"" doctrine permits limited use of copyrighted materials for purposes such as teaching, research, or creating a transformative work.In an email to WIRED, Reuters' representative Jeffrey McCoy expressed satisfaction with the verdict, stating that: “We are pleased that the court granted summary judgment in our favor and concluded that Westlaw’s editorial content created and maintained by our attorney editors, is protected by copyright and cannot be used without our consent,” he wrote. “The copying of our content was not ‘fair use.’”Reuters' victory emerges amidst an increasing number of legal challenges initiated by creators, artists and music companies against AI system developers over comparable concerns.The common thread in these legal disputes is the allegation that technology firms utilised vast collections of human-authored content to train their AI systems for generating text that mimics human writing, without seeking authorisation or offering payment to the original content creators.OpenAI and its commercial partner Microsoft are facing copyright infringement lawsuits from renowned authors, including John Grisham, Jodi Picoult, and ""Game of Thrones"" creator George R.R.
