From cut-off to court

Two key issues

Appointments Overruled

Revision ordered

What next?

Allahabad high court last week directed UP government to draw up a fresh list for the appointment of 69,000 assistant teachers, setting aside selections made in June 2020 and Jan 2022. Revising an earlier order, the court held that reserved category candidates who qualify for the general category merit list should be migrated to that category.In December 2018, UP government announced the Assistant Teachers’ Recruitment Test-2019 (ATRE-2019), which was at the time the state government’s biggest recruitment drive for the selection of 69,000 primary teachers in the basic education department.About 4.3 lakh candidates registered of which approximately 4.1 lakh appeared for the test on January 6, 2019.The exam was a qualifying exercise and no caste-based reservations applied and neither was any cut-off criteria announced. It was also clarified that merely by qualifying via ATRE-2019, the incumbent would not have any right to appointment since it was only a test to establish eligibility for appointment to the post of assistant teacher.On January 7, 2019, UP government fixed 97 out of 150 (65% marks) as the cut-off for general category and 90 (60% marks) for the reserved category. A few candidates moved high court against this cut-off. On March 29, 2019, a single-judge bench set 40% and 45% marks, respectively, as cut-offs for the reserved and general categories. However, a division bench on May 6 of that year upheld the government’s initial eligibility criteria.Thereafter, the basic education department started the recruitment process based on ATRE results released in June 2020. On Oct 11, 2020, appointment letters were given to 31,277 candidates and, on Nov 30, 2020, 36,590 more candidates were recruited. Thus, 67,867 of the 69,000 posts were filled with 1,133 posts of ST candidates shown as lying vacant due to non-availability of suitable candidates.After the final merit list of June 2020, a large number of reserved category candidates moved high court. They had two main grievances:➤ The compartmentalisation of candidates for implementing vertical reservation was not mentioned at the time of the ATRE-2019 exam though it was an open competitive examination for the post of assistant teacher.➤ Two select lists were published without declaring category-wise cut-offs and that more than 50% of general category candidates were selected without giving due representation to reserved category candidates per their prescribed quota.That had led to MRCs — or Meritorious Reserved Category students, who made it to the merit list without availing the quota cut-off — being placed in the reserved category instead of general category under the provisions of Sec. 3(6) of the Reservation Act, 1994. That meant reserved category candidates were deprived of their right of reservation per Sec. 3(1) of the Reservation Act, 1994 read with Section 3(6). It was alleged that as many as 19,000-reserved category candidates, hence, missed out on quota benefits.In court, UP government admitted that the provisions of the Reservation Act, 1994, were not properly followed in the selection of 69,000 assistant teachers. Which is why, on January 5, 2022, an additional list was published of 6,800 more appointments from among the reserved category candidates. But that list was also challenged in Allahabad high court on the grounds that it was finalised without due procedure.A single-judge bench of high court on March 3, 2023, set aside the appointment of the 6,800 additional teachers from the reserved category. It also directed that the basic education department revise the original merit list of June 1, 2020, to select 69,000 assistant teachers. The court said that any reserved-category candidate who had benefited from relaxation of marks shall not be migrated from their respective category to the unreserved category while preparing the list per the quality points based on Appendix I of Service Rules, 1981.Both reserved and unreserved category candidates challenged this order. Some petitioners said that MRC candidates had been kept in the reserved category despite securing more than the cut-off marks fixed for the unreserved categories. Petitioners from the unreserved category pleaded that some reserved category candidates, who had taken the benefit of quota cut-offs, had been wrongly kept in the unreserved category.A high court division bench on August 13, 2024, modified the single-bench order. While the single-judge bench had asked UP government to revise the merit list of June 2020, the division bench said that the June 2020 list should be totally ignored and a fresh list prepared within three months in line with Sec. 3(6) of Reservation Rules, 1994, and Basic Education Rules, 1981.The court, however, asked UP government to follow the ATRE-19 results. It ruled that reserved-category candidates would be migrated to the general category if they secured marks that were higher than the prescribed cut-off for the general category.“If a reserved category candidate acquires merit equivalent to the merit prescribed for the general category, the MRC candidate shall be migrated to the general category per the provisions contained in Section 3(6) of the Reservation Act, 1994,” the court ordered.Further, the bench refused to interfere in the single-bench decision rejecting the additional list of 6,800 candidates of reserved category that were identified for appointment on January 5, 2022.With the entire list set to be redrawn, some candidates are bound to get adversely affected. However, the school education department said no injustice would be done to any selected candidate.The court said that “while preparing the fresh lists... if any one of the working candidates is affected by the action of the state government/competent authority, they shall be given the session benefit so that the students may not suffer.”After a meeting chaired by CM Yogi Adityanath on Sunday, UP government decided in principle to not challenge the HC order. A government statement said the CM was of the opinion that SC aspirants must get the benefit of quota per the Constitution but, at the same time, there should be no discrimination against any candidate.","Allahabad high court last week directed UP government to draw up a fresh list for the appointment of 69,000 assistant teachers. The court held that reserved category candidates who qualify for the general category merit list should be migrated to that category. About 4.3 lakh candidates registered of which approximately 4.1 lakh appeared for the test on January 6, 2019.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112639894,imgsize-1127940,width-400,resizemode-4/112639894.jpg"

"India-Japan 2+2: Security, defence and Quad on agenda",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/quad-security-and-defence-on-agenda-at-india-japan-22/articleshow/112635782.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amid growing convergence on strategic issues , particularly the common agenda of ensuring a free and open Indo-Pacific, India and Japan are in talks to revise and update the joint declaration on security cooperation they signed in 2008. The third India-Japan 2+2 foreign and defence industrial meeting on Tuesday will look to carry forward the ongoing dialogue for the same, paving the way for a formal announcement at the summit level later this year.Foreign minister S Jaishankar and defence minister Rajnath Singh will host their counterparts, Yoko Kamikawa and Minoru Kihara respectively, looking to further intensify defence and security cooperation between the 2 countries.Recognising the need to work together for peace and stability in Asia and their common interest in the safety of sea lines of communications, the landmark 2008 declaration had laid the foundations for stronger security cooperation through, among other things, strategic dialogue between the foreign ministers and consultations between the defence ministers and NSAs.The 2 sides are also expected to discuss India’s proposal for a Quad summit, which PM Narendra Modi has to host this year, on the margins of the UN General Assembly next month in New York City. With the US preoccupied with the November presidential election, this will effectively be the last chance for India to have the meeting in 2024.The chances of the Summit taking place in the US in September received a boost this week, with reports from Tokyo suggesting that Kishida, who will step down as PM after the ruling LDP leadership poll in late September, is considering visiting the US just before he demits office to participate in the General Assembly and to also meet President Joe Biden. Significantly, former Japan PM Yoshihide Suga too had travelled to the US in September, 2021, to participate in the first in-person Quad summit just before he stepped down. Quad has emerged as a key foreign policy pillar for India, Australia, Japan and the US as they work jointly to ensure a free, open and prosperous Indo-Pacific that is resilient and free from coercion.In the 2+2, Japan and India are also expected to discuss the proposed transfer by Tokyo of stealth ship antennas and related technology to the Indian Navy. The Tokyo based Nikkei Asia reported last week that Japan will announce an agreement for the same during the talks on Tuesday. The 2 countries are already cooperating in areas like Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV)/Robotics.Apart from the increasing Chinese assertiveness in the region talks are also expected on the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and the Gaza crisis with both sides likely to reaffirm their commitment to a rules-based global order that respects sovereignty and territorial integrity of nations, as also the need to follow international law and not do anything to unilaterally change the status quo.","India and Japan are in talks to revise and update the joint declaration on security cooperation they signed in 2008.

Law banning 'triple talaq' enacted as SC verdict non-deterrent: Centre,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/law-banning-triple-talaq-enacted-as-sc-verdict-non-deterrent-centre/articleshow/112635737.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Union government on Monday told the Supreme Court that Parliament was compelled to enact a law in 2019 to make Muslim men who instantaneously divorce their wives through ' triple talaq ' liable to imprisonment as the SC's 2017 ruling declaring it unconstitutional did not prove to be a deterrent against such unilateral sudden snapping of marital relationships that left abandoned married women destitute.Defending validity of The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019, whose validity was challenged by 'Samastha Kerala Jamiathul Ulema', the Centre said despite a 5-J bench ruling in 2017 in Shayara Bano case, ""there have been reports of divorce by way of 'talaq-e-biddat' from different parts of the country.""""It was seen that setting aside 'talaq-e-biddat' by the SC has not worked as a sufficient deterrent in bringing down the number of divorces by this practice among certain Muslims,"" the govt said, adding this was the reason why it felt the pressing need for giving effect to SC's ruling through a law to protect the dignity of married Muslim women.It said, ""Parliament in its wisdom has enacted the law to protect the right of married Muslim women who are being divorced by triple talaq. The law helps in ensuring larger constitutional goals of gender justice and gender equality of married Muslim women and helps subserve their fundamental rights of non-discrimination and empowerment.""The Centre termed as baseless the petitioner's claim that marriage being governed by personal law must be exempt from the ambit of criminal law. ""Marriages are a social institution which the State has a special interest in protecting. It is beyond doubt that the State can protect the stability of marriages by resorting to the device of criminal law,"" it said, citing enactment of Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 and Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961.It also justified the law holding Muslim husbands alone accountable by saying it is he and his relatives who indulge in such practice.

NEW DELHI: A day after the AIADMK insinuated that the ruling DMK is covertly working with BJP under a ""secret pact"", the DMK supremo MK Stalin on Monday cleared the air. The Tamil Nadu chief minister outright rejected claims of any secret tie up with the saffron party, saying he would never compromise on principles, merely for the sake of politics.""We don’t have the necessity for secret ties.We would never give up on our rights. This has been the path laid down for us by(CN Annadurai) and(M Karunanidhi)"".“Just because we have invited Rajnath Singh, they have circulated news that DMK will ally with the BJP,” he said.The chief minister also flayed AIADMK's Edappadi Palanisamy, saying that the DMK ""did not have the habit of crawling to get posts"" like the ex-chief minister.“AIADMK men who chant 'Amma' round-the-clock and carry her (Jayalalithaa’s) picture in their pockets and do prayers have not held a single condolence meeting for her. They do not have any right to criticise the coin release function,"" Stalin said.However, to the surprise of many, the Dravidian leader heaped praise for defense minister Rajnath Singh for presiding over the event to mark the birth centenary of his father. The chief minister said the union home minister accepted the invitation without thinking twice, and he was overwhelmed with happiness, so much so that ""his sleep” was compromised on Sunday night.In, fact he went one step further to shower more praise by saying that the defense minister's speech was unparalleled and deserved to be ""recorded in history.""""Rajnath Singh spoke greatly about our leader Karunanidhi in such a way that even our DMK men would not,"" he said.Stalin further added that “there was no compulsion for Rajnath Singh to laud Karunanidhi .

This only shows their relationship"", Palanisamy said on Sunday.""I’ve said this many times. It was being said that there was a secret relationship between DMK and BJP, even our administrators were saying so. Now the media has also started to raise this question.

What is lateral entry into bureaucracy? All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/what-is-lateral-entry-into-bureaucracy-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/112625939.cms,"What triggered the political debate?

Why is the opposition criticising the move?

How has BJP defended the move?

NEW DELHI: Lateral entry into bureaucracy is a practice that involves recruiting individuals from outside the traditional government service cadres to fill mid and senior-level positions.Lateral entry into bureaucracy was formally introduced during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's tenure, with the first set of vacancies announced in 2018. Candidates are typically hired on contracts ranging from three to five years, with potential extensions based on performance.The aim is to address complex governance and policy implementation challenges by tapping into external expertise.The concept of lateral entry has historical precedence. It was initially recommended by the Second Administrative Reforms Commission (ARC) established in 2005 during the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government led by Congress. The ARC, chaired by Veerappa Moily, advocated for lateral entry to fill roles requiring specialised knowledge unavailable within traditional civil services. These recommendations emphasised recruiting professionals from the private sector, academia and PSUs to improve policy implementation and governance.The Union Public Service Commission ( UPSC ) issued an advertisement seeking applications for lateral recruitment to 45 senior positions , including joint secretary, director and deputy secretary in 24 ministries of the Union government.These posts are key decision-makers and administrative heads within departments. Candidates with appropriate qualifications and experience from state/UT governments, PSUs, statutory organisations, research institutes, universities and the private sector are eligible to apply.Reservation in public jobs and universities is implemented via the 13-point roster policy. However, a Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) circular notes that there are no mandatory reservations for appointments on deputation, and the current process of filling posts through lateral entry is considered a close approximation of deputation.""In a single post cadre, reservation does not apply. Since each post to be filled under this scheme [lateral entry] is a Single Post, reservation is not applicable,"" files obtained from the DoPT state.Opposition leaders argue this lacks reservation for Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), and Other Backward Classes (OBC), while the government defends it as a means to bring in specialised talent and expertise.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has criticised lateral entry, accusing the Modi government of using it as a backdoor to recruit officers loyal to the BJP's ideological mentor, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). ""Lateral entry is an attack on Dalits, OBCs, and Adivasis. BJP's distorted version of Ram Rajya seeks to destroy the Constitution and snatch reservations from Bahujans,"" Gandhi said on social media platform X.Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge described lateral entry as part of a 'well-planned conspiracy' to exclude marginalised communities from government jobs.Rashtriya Janata Dal's Tejashwi Yadav and former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayawati have also condemned the move, arguing that it deprives underprivileged candidates of opportunities for advancement within the government.""A question to the honorable judges and the central government who are forcibly looking for creamy layer in OBC/SC/ST: Where does the so-called creamy layer of these classes go when they are in these posts?"" Chandrashekhar Aazad of the Azad Samaj Party questioned.BJP has countered these criticisms by pointing out that the concept of lateral entry was developed during the Congress-led UPA government.Union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw tweeted, ""INC hypocrisy is evident on lateral entry matter. It was the UPA government which developed the concept of lateral entry. The second Admin Reforms Commission (ARC) was established in 2005 under UPA government. Shri Veerappa Moily chaired it.""In total, 63 appointments have been made through lateral entry in the last five years, as per minister of state for the DoPT Jitendra Singh. Presently, 57 lateral entrants occupy positions in various ministries/departments.","Lateral entry into bureaucracy was formally introduced during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's tenure.

"Lateral entry today is a contentious issue, but it has been around since Nehru's days",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lateral-entry-today-is-a-contentious-issue-but-it-has-been-around-since-nehrus-days/articleshow/112635406.cms,"NEW DELHI: Government's latest move to induct 45 mid-level specialists through the lateral entry route has stirred a political controversy . But ever since the industrial management pool days in the 1950s, to inducting specialists such as IG Patel, Manmohan Singh, V Krishnamurthy, Montek Singh Ahluwalia, and RV Shahi, government has always had lateral inductions , although it was largely limited to senior posts.If it was the absence of economists that prompted the Centre to rope in Bimal Jalan, Vijay Kelkar and Rakesh Mohan, the fous now, as the latest UPSC advertisement to recruit joint secretaries and directors suggests, is on technology and environment like sectors where the current civil service set up does not allow specialisation.In 1959, PM Jawaharlal Nehru started the industrial management pool that saw the likes of Mantosh Sodhi join the government and later become secretary of heavy industry. V Krishnamurthy, who successfully led PSUs such as BHEL and SAIL, was another lateral entry who was the heavy industry secretary. Similarly, D V Kapur went on to head three ministries - power, heavy industry and chemicals and petrochemical. Before then, in 1954, I G Patel joined as deputy economic adviser from IMF and later went on to become economic affairs secretary and RBI governor.In 1971, former PM Manmohan Singh joined as economic adviser in the commerce ministry before moving on hold several other assignments. During Janata government M Menezes, a railway engineer, was made secretary defence production.Rajiv Gandhi appointed K P P Nambiar, chairman of the Kerala Electronics Development Corporation, as the electronics secretary and Sam Pitroda joined to lead the Centre for Development of Telematics (C-DOT).In 2002 the Vajpayee government inducted R V Shahi from the private sector to push electricity reforms as power secretary.Several of the economists who joined government in 1980s and 1990s came at additional secretary level and then went on to hold secretary level posts.It is only since 2018 that the Modi government has gone for a lateral hiring strategy on a bigger scale, and at the middle level.While it cited the recommendations of the second administrative reforms commission to hit back at Congress, the failure to attract the best talent in government jobs has played a role, more so because several IAS officers are not keen to come for central deputation.In any case, there are few who are able to develop the expertise during their career, having had to handle a diverse set of jobs.The lack of qualified officers, leave alone specialists, has led to the emergence of the Big Four syndrome where consultants work on everything from designing investment strategies to even presentations that secretaries often make to the PM's Office.""With the level of expertise available now through regular UPSC recruitment (MBAs, engineers, doctors, candidates with high computer science knowledge), there is enough talent within the services...It is a question of finding the right person for each job. government should focus on creating a results oriented administrative system. We retain our old process oriented colonial system of administration with hardly any change while many other countries have moved on with new public management and new public governance systems,"" said former cabinet secretary K M Chandrasekhar, who is not a supporter of the lateral entry system.Overnight reorientation is unlikely given that bureaucracy is resistant to change, said a secretary rank officer.""In NITI Aayog we institutionalised lateral entry at the level of joint secretaries, directors and young professionals, who brought in a lot of fresh ideas and young energy, which helped us roll out several initiatives, including PLI, aspirational districts and AI,"" said Amitabh Kant, who was the CEO of the government think tank. Kant advocates a five-year term, instead of three for such joinees. ""Lateral entry should be a two-way street with government officers allowed to work in the private sector, international agencies and civil society organisations working at grassroot level.""","Government's latest move to induct 45 mid-level specialists through the lateral entry route has stirred a political controversy.

NEW DELHI: A Delhi court pulled up Enforcement Directorate (ED) while discharging Nitin Bhatnagar, a close aide to senior Congress functionary Kamal Nath 's nephew Ratul Puri, in a money-laundering case in which Central Bank of India was allegedly cheated of Rs 354 crore.ED has alleged that Moser Baer, main accused in the case, defrauded Central Bank of India and other banks of Rs 7,980 crore.Ratul Puri was executive director of Moser Baer.The court of special judge Sanjeev Aggarwal said, ""How could the accused, who was only working as a relationship manager in Bank of Singapore, have worked out that such funds were part of the dirty money?"" The court outlined the failure of banking entities, which were ""under legal obligation to report"" the suspicious transactions, but did not do so.The court noted the transactions were of the year 2012-13, and there was no way Bhatnagar could have found out it was laundered money.

Most of them, however, have remained inconclusive.While one needs to await the course of action of the CJI-led bench on Tuesday in the RG Kar hospital incident, a matter dealing with the remission policy of Chhattisgarh which attracted the SC's suo motu attention six months ago, is yet to be listed.In another instance, the SC took cognisance on its own of the Madhya Pradesh HC terminating the services of six women judicial officers. Though proceedings were initiated on December 17 last year, a bench led by Justice B V Nagarathna is yet to reach a conclusion.Another Calcutta HC judgement passing sweeping remarks gratuitously asking adolescent girls to ""control sexual urge as in the eyes of the society, she is the loser when she gives in to enjoy the sexual pleasure of hardly two minutes."" SC titled its proceedings 'In Re: Right to privacy of adolescent' and expunged the observations. But the judgment, reserved on May 17, is yet to be pronounced.Between 1991-2022, it took suo motu cognisance of 50-odd cases, 10 of those, prompted by the depredations of the Covid pandemic in 2020, including taking stock of oxygen supply to Delhi and states, providing proper healthcare to patients and dignified handling of bodies in hospitals, ensuring adequate rest to doctors working tirelessly through the challenging times, keeping judiciary functional through virtual mode and asking govts to provide relief and rehabilitation to children orphaned by Covid.This year's first suo motu civil case was registered by the SC on January 28, when it permanently stayed Justice Abhijit Gangopadhyay's order asking SC secretary general to send him the documents that were placed before the CJI. Gangopadhyay has since resigned as a judge of Calcutta HC and got elected to Lok Sabha on BJP ticket.Two more suo motu proceedings were initiated by the SC relating to recruitment of persons with disabilities and visually impaired in judiciary. In April, the SC had taken out proceedings against Gautam Budh Nagar District Bar Association office bearers for alleged assault on SC Bar Association members, who had appeared before the trial court despite a strike call.In May, CJI DY Chandrachud had initiated suo motu proceedings for expediting the shifting Bombay high court to a new building. The HC, functioning since January 1879 from a four-storied stone structure resembling a castle built in gothic style and reflecting Mumbai's multi-cultural ethos and exuberance, would move to a modern building to be constructed at a 30-acre plot in Bandra East.The last suo motu proceedings before the CJI were provoked by the audacious order of a Punjab and Haryana HC judge, Rajbir Sehrawat, who had cast doubts on the wisdom and majesty of the highest court. The SC had expunged the judge's unwarranted remarks with a warning.In 2023, the SC took suo motu cognisance in three matters, one relating to management of Sariska Tiger Reserve and a temple within it attracting thousands of devotees.

India, of course, remains worried about the tightening strategic clinch between China and Russia.On Monday, the discussions Between Admiral Moiseyev and Gen Chauhan “underscored the mutual commitment towards enhancing maritime security, deepening strategic cooperation and fostering a stronger defence partnership between the two nations”, an official said.Another official added, “The visit is a testimony to the longstanding relationship between the navies of Russia and India. The visit aims to strengthen bilateral naval relations , as also to explore new avenues for naval cooperation.”The Russian Navy chief’s visit, which will also see him touring the Western Naval Command and Mazagon Docks in Mumbai, comes ahead of the delivery of two guided-missile frigates being built in Russia for India. The delivery of the frigates as well as the remaining two squadrons of the five S-400 Triumf air defence missile systems for the IAF have been delayed due to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, as reported by TOI earlier.The first of the two 4,000-tonne multi-purpose frigates is now likely to be delivered by the Yantar Shipyard in Kaliningrad within a couple of months and will be commissioned as INS Tushil. The second one, INS Tamal, in turn, will be delivered by early next year.India in October 2018 had inked an umbrella agreement for the procurement of the four Grigorovich-class frigates. While the first two frigates are to be imported from Russia for around Rs 8,000 crore, the next two are being built at the Goa Shipyard with transfer of technology at an overall cost of around Rs 13,000 crore, as was earlier reported by TOI.All the four frigates will be armed with the BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles, apart from other weapon systems and sensors. They will add to the six such Russian stealth frigates, three Talwar-class and three Teg-class warships, already inducted into the Indian Navy from 2003-2004 onwards.","Admiral Aleksandr Alekseyevich Moiseyev, on an official visit to India from Aug 19 to 22.

Plan to make national highway authorities’ nod mandatory for speed limit changes by states,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/plan-to-make-national-highway-authorities-nod-mandatory-for-speed-limit-changes-by-states/articleshow/112633270.cms,"NEW DELHI: In its bid to end confusion about speed limit on national highways and expressways across states, the road transport ministry is working on an amendment to the Motor Vehicle Act , making it mandatory for states to consult highway authorities before reducing maximum speed limit on any NH stretch falling within their jurisdiction.While national highways usually have a speed limit of 100 kmph, cars can go up to 120 kmph on expressways.But states have the final say in fixing the limit, depending on local conditions“State authorities notifying different speed limits on NHs than what the Centre has notified creates confusion among drivers, who don’t take such stretches frequently. This also becomes a source of corruption for local law enforcement agencies,” a source told TOI, explaining the rationale for the change.According to the proposal, the state agencies will have to consult the regional officers (ROs) of the highways-owning agencies — NHAI, NHIDCL and road transport ministry — before notifying any other speed norm. This is among a raft of changes being proposed to the MV Act.Another proposed amendment is to double the penalty and fines for traffic offences committed by school buses to make drivers and vehicle owners (educational institutions) more accountable. The ministry proposes to include a new clause in the Act, which will be amended following its assurance to the Supreme Court to expand the definition of light motor vehicle (LMV).Sources said the new provision would mean that violators would have to pay double the fine for all offences committed from jumping red light, speeding and lane violation to not having an active fitness certificate and road permit.“A new section will be introduced in the law considering the rising number of instances of accidents involving school buses carrying children. The objective is to improve the safety of students going to schools or any other educational institution,” said an official.In April, six school students were killed in Narnaul in Haryana after a bus carrying 40 met with an accident. Investigation revealed that the driver was drunk.","The road transport ministry is working on an amendment to the Motor Vehicle Act.

Mpox, a global health emergency

NEW DELHI: The union health ministry has instructed all airports and land ports on the borders with Bangladesh and Pakistan to remain vigilant for international passengers showing symptoms of Mpox , according to a PTI report citing official sources.The ministry has designated three Centre-run hospitals in Delhi- Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, Safdarjung Hospital, and Lady Hardinge Medical College - as key centers for the isolation, management, and treatment of Mpox patients.State governments have also been instructed to identify and designate similar hospitals within their regions.The health ministry has also directed officials to strengthen surveillance efforts and implement effective measures for the rapid detection of Mpox cases. The network of testing laboratories has been advised to be prepared for early diagnosis, with 32 laboratories across the country currently equipped to test for Mpox.P K Mishra , the principal secretary to the prime minister, led a high-level meeting on Sunday to evaluate the country's preparedness for Mpox, emphasising the need for heightened surveillance to ensure prompt detection. While there are currently no reported cases of Mpox in India, officials indicated that the risk of a widespread outbreak with sustained transmission remains low.Mishra also emphasised the critical importance of widely disseminating prevention and treatment protocols. He highlighted the necessity of launching an awareness campaign to educate healthcare providers on recognizing the signs and symptoms of Mpox and ensuring timely reporting to the surveillance system.The World Health Organization ( WHO ) has declared Mpox a Public Health Emergency of International Concern ( PHEIC ) due to its prevalence and spread across multiple African countries. An official source said that the current strain of the virus is more virulent and infectious, but the likelihood of a major outbreak in India is still considered low.According to WHO, since 2022, there have been 99,176 cases and 208 deaths due to Mpox reported from 116 countries globally. In 2023, the number of reported cases worldwide significantly increased, and this year, more than 15,600 cases and 537 deaths have already been recorded. Since 2022, India has reported 30 cases of Mpox, with the last case detected in March 2024.","The union health ministry has instructed all airports and land ports on the borders with Bangladesh and Pakistan to remain vigilant for international passengers showing symptoms of Mpox.

NEW DELHI: Rajya Sabha MP Sudha Murthy found herself at the receiving end of public flak after tracing the roots of Raksha Bandhan to Mughal emperor Humayun . In a video posted on X, the Philanthropist wished people on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan and drew parallels to the origins of the festival to ""Rani Karnavati sending a thread to Humayun"" when she was in danger in the 16th century.“Raksha Bandhan has a rich history. When Rani Karnavati was in danger, she sent a thread to King Humayun as a symbol of sibling-hood, asking for his help. This is where the tradition of the thread began and it continues to this day,” the wife of the Infosys founder captioned her post featuring the video.“Raksha Bandhan or Rakhi is one of the important festivals according to me where a sister ties a thread, it need not be a huge one, a thread is fine, indicating that in case of my difficulty, you should always be there to help me. Siblings are so important in life. It goes back, Rani Karnavati was in danger. Her kingdom was small. It was attacked by somebody else. She did not know what to do. She sent a small piece of thread to King Humayun, a Mughal emperor, saying that I am in danger. Please consider me as your sister, and please do come and protect me. Humayun did not know what it is because he came from different country,” the Rajya Sabha MP said in the video.However, the wife of Infosys founder was not spared by those deeming her version of the story insensitive, eventually forcing the billionaire to clarify her stance. After facing heat from public, Sudha Murthy wrote another post to clear the air on the matter. She argued that the story she had narrated was one of many tales associated with the festival, certainly not its origin, and clarified that it was brought out with the intention of recalling the ""symbolism"" behind the age-old festival.""The story I shared on Raksha Bandhan is just one of many tales associated with the festival and certainly not its origin. As I have said in the video clip, this was already a custom of the land,"" she said.A user irked by her narration of the story said, ""You alienated the left with ur spoon remark and now the right also with this uncalled for ""tale"" on Raksha Bandhan.Another user sarcastically wrote,"" Thank you for bringing the Mughal Connection Ma’m….every Hindu festival we will be eagerly waiting to hear such stories about the origins of our festivals.

'Lateral entry began under your administration': Union minister Arjun Ram Meghwal defends lateral entry scheme amid opposition's criticism,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lateral-entry-began-under-your-administration-union-minister-arjun-ram-meghwal-defends-lateral-entry-scheme-amid-oppositions-criticism/articleshow/112632026.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amid heavy criticism over the Centre's push for lateral entry into top government jobs , Union minister Arjun Ram Meghwal on Monday countered opposition allegations by pointing out that the previous UPA government also inducted outside talents, such as Manmohan Singh and Montek Singh Ahluwalia, into administrative roles.Addressing Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's claims, Meghwal said, ""Rahul Gandhi is the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha and holds a constitutional position.He claims that RSS members are recruited through lateral entry. We want to point out that Dr. Manmohan Singh was also part of lateral entry, as he was directly made the Finance Secretary in 1976. Similarly, Montek Singh Ahluwalia, the Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission, was also part of lateral entry. There are hundreds of such examples.""""When Prime Minister Narendra Modi came, he asked if there was any system for this. For instance, the National Advisory Council was formed, and Sonia Gandhi was made its chairperson. Is this a constitutional post? You placed her above the Prime Minister. Lateral entry was started by you. Modi established it formally,"" he added.Meghwal also cited the Second Administrative Reforms Commission, which recommended reforms to improve the effectiveness, transparency, and citizen-friendliness of the Indian administrative system, accusing the Congress of failing to implement these recommendations.""In 2005, the Administrative Reforms Commission report was released, but no action was taken. You were in power from 2005 to 2014 and did nothing. Modi formalized the system, ensuring that theUPSC will handle recruitment through proper procedures,"" he added.“These are contract posts, such as Joint Secretary, Director, or Deputy Secretary, where candidates should be experts in their field. For instance, an environmental issue should be managed by someone with relevant expertise. This is an open process where anyone can apply. The UPSC vacancies remain separate,” he explained.Meanwhile, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor diverged from his party’s stance, supporting the policy by claiming it is an essential method for acquiring expertise that the government otherwise lacks.On X, Tharoor stated, ""My position on lateral entry is that it is an indispensable method for the government to acquire expertise in specific areas where there are no qualified persons already in government service. In the short term, it remains unavoidable.""""In the long term, what is needed is for government officers, recruited under existing rules, including applicable reservations, to be trained in the specializations required by the government,"" he added.The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) on Saturday advertised 45 posts—10 of Joint Secretaries and 35 of Directors/Deputy Secretaries—to be filled through lateral entry on a contract basis . This represents the largest tranche of lateral recruitment undertaken by the Centre, an official said.Traditionally, these roles are filled by officers from the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), Indian Police Service (IPS), Indian Forest Service (IFoS), and other Group A services.","The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) on Saturday advertised 45 posts to be filled through lateral entry on a contract basis.

NEW INDIA: India's modern infrastructure represents a significant leap forward in terms of scale, technology, and sustainability, reflecting the country's rapid economic growth and urbanization. This infrastructure spans various domains, including transportation, energy, urban development, and digital connectivity. India had witnessed the development of world's highest railway bridge and also had constructed the longest highway tunnel.Here’s an overview of some key aspects of modern infrastructure in India:At the time of Independence, close to 80% of Punjab’s cultivable, canal-irrigated land went to Pakistan. So, in 1948, the construction of the Bhakra-Nangal project took off. When it was completed in 1963, Jawaharlal Nehru described it as the “new temple of resurgent India”. There are two dams on the Satluj river. One at Bhakra village in Himachal Pradesh’s Bilaspur district. And the other, about 13 km downstream, at Nangal in Punjab. The reservoir of these dams is the Gobind Sagar, which helped to irrigate an arid Punjab and took care of the peculiar problem created by Partition. And don’t forget: the dam also helps generate 1,325 MW electricity.It took almost five decades to complete but bringing water to the desert isn’t an easy job. Work on the Rajasthan Canal, renamed Indira Gandhi Canal in Nov 1984 following the assassination of the former PM, began in 1958, and now runs over 650km, bringing in a dash of green to the Thar desert. It now irrigates over 16 lakh acres in Rajasthan’s Jaisalmer and Barmer districts. The canal, which begins at the confluence of Satluj and Beas in Punjab, and ends in Jaisalmer, has pushed wheat, cotton and mustard production in the desert.The plan was drawn way back in 1920. But the foundation stone for the Kolkata (then Calcutta) Metro was laid only in 1972 and operations began in 1984. It became India’s first rapid transit system and a blueprint for Metros in other Indian cities. In March this year, it hit yet another milestone – when a train whizzed along a short span of 520m for just 45 seconds under the Hooghly river, a portion of the stretch between Howrah and Mahakaran stations, it became the country's first underwater train.The Metro track that opened in Delhi in 2002 was called the Red Line. It, however, turned out to be the first ‘green step’ for the country’s capital that had begun choking when a growth spurt in the 1990s led to an increase in private vehicles. The Delhi Metro now has 10 colour-coded lines that stretch over 350km with 256 stations. It has a daily ridership of 46 lakh, making it India’s largest and busiest Metro, also connecting its satellite cities like Gurgaon, Faridabad, Noida and Ghaziabad.It is the world’s highest highway tunnel, at 10,000 feet, built under the Rohtang Pass in Himachal Pradesh in the Pir Panjal Range of the Himalayas. The 9.02km stretch now links Ladakh to Manali and Chandigarh year-round, avoiding the snow-covered Rohtang Pass in winter. It provides strategic advantage to the Armed Forces, which gets year-long connectivity to border areas.It isn’t just a design marvel and a stupendous engineering feat, it’s an emotion. For, the Chenab Rail Bridge – the world’s tallest rail bridge at 1,178 feet, spanning the Chenab river – connects Kashmir to the rest of India. It was inaugurated in Aug 2022. The steel and concrete arch bridge carrying a single-track railway line connects Sangaldan and Reasi stations. Train services that will connect Kashmir to Jammu are expected to start soon.India’s financial capital, Mumbai, has always been synonymous with bad traffic. That changed for some early this year with the Mumbai Trans Harbour Link, a 21.8km six-lane expressway bridge – the world’s 12th longest sea bridge -- connecting Mumbai with Navi Mumbai. The bridge, first conceptualised six decades ago, has cut travel time between Sewri (near Parel in Mumbai) and Chirle in Navi Mumbai to under 20 minutes.","India's modern infrastructure represents a significant leap forward in terms of scale, technology, and sustainability. This infrastructure spans various domains, including transportation, energy, urban development, and digital connectivity.

The Oropouche virus , also known as the "" sloth fever ,"" is emerging as a growing health concern in Europe, with 19 cases being reported in June and July alone.Cases have been reported in Spain, Italy, and Germany each confirming infections , according to the European Center for Disease Control.According to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), over 7,700 cases of the Oropouche virus have been detected this year across five countries: Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Cuba, and Colombia.The virus is primarily transmitted through the bites of midges , although it could be also spread through mosquitoes , according to the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.While the virus is linked to pale-throated sloths as a reservoir, it also affects non-human primates and birds.“The term ‘sloth fever’ is a colloquial name that has emerged due to the virus being found in areas where sloths, which are known to carry a range of parasites and pathogens, are present,” explained Carolina Goncalves, superintendent pharmacist at Pharmica. “However, the name is relatively misleading as it is spread by insect bites, not by direct contact with sloths.”The virus was first discovered in the village of Oropouche in Trinidad and Tobago in 1955.Although oropouche virus is not new, the factors driving the recent sharp increase highlight the need for further investigation, Goncalves said.A study in the Lancet Journal published earlier this year described the virus as ""a prototypical neglected disease."" The review further said that the virus ""has the potential to emerge as a significant threat"" due to its ability to spread widely and cause serious health issues.“There is much we still do not know about the oropouche virus but one of the main concerns arising from the current outbreak in South America is its potential harmful effects on unborn fetuses,” said Dr Enny Paixao, associate professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.Authorities in Brazil are investigating recent reports that pregnant women could have transmitted the virus to their unborn children, according to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO).“Some very limited studies have suggested that antibodies against the virus have been found in children born with microcephaly and that there may be a link between infection, miscarriage, and fetal deaths in Brazil, but further research is needed to investigate a potential causal link,” says Paixao.The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine states that those infected usually develop a fever within three to eight days, accompanied by a rash, headache, and muscle or joint pain with associated weakness.Some individuals may also experience gastrointestinal issues and light sensitivity. Meningitis is a life-threatening complication that could occur in severe cases.Currently, there are no specific treatments or vaccines for the virus.Patients are typically advised to rest, stay hydrated, and take over-the-counter pain relievers such as paracetamol to reduce fever and alleviate pain.In more extreme cases, a patient might have to be hospitalised, although in severe cases and if complications arise supportive care is necessary.“When travelling to affected areas, you can avoid the infection by preventing insect bites. Use insect repellent, cover exposed skin and sleep under a treated bed net,” said Veal. “Plan ahead and look up your destination and the latest health information and advice, particularly if you are pregnant.”","The Oropouche virus, also known as the "" sloth fever,"" is emerging as a growing health concern in Europe. 19 cases have been reported in June and July alone.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Sunday took suo motu cognisance of the August 9 rape-murder of a doctor at Kolkata's R G Kar hospital. This comes days after Calcutta HC had transferred to probe to CBI expressing reservations about Kolkata police's probe into the case.CJI D Y Chandrachud ordered registration of suo motu criminal writ petition. A bench also comprising Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra will initiate proceedings at 10.30 am on Tuesday.It is rare for SC to take suo motu cognisance of an issue that has already been taken serious note of by a jurisdictional high court.The very fact that the apex court has taken note of the incident indicates its intention to examine long-neglected systemic loopholes resulting in such incidents.While high court may still be permitted to carry on with the monitoring of the ongoing CBI investigations, SC is expected to take a pan-India call on the lack of safety of doctors and healthcare professionals, especially women, in hospitals. The bench headed by CJI is likely to seek responses from West Bengal and Union governments about addressing this issue.It may also decide to implead all states and Union Territories as parties to the case if it were to lay down a pan-India safety guideline.Another factor which may have forced SC to take up the case was the Aug 14 midnight vandalism at the Kolkata hospital that was allegedly aimed at foiling a planned rally by doctors and students in solidarity with simultaneous “reclaim the night” marches across the city. The mob targeted patients, staff, medical equipment and hospital property. Nurses, security guards, and even visitors were traumatised by threats given by the mob. Subsequently, high court rapped state government for its inability to provide security to medical and healthcare professionals and staff at the hospital.Interestingly, an SC bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna, Sanjay Karol and Sanjay Kumar had dismissed a writ petition filed by Delhi Medical Association and Dr Satyajit Borah last month seeking adequate security for medical and healthcare professionals citing numerous incidents of violent attacks on doctors by irate relatives of patients.Justice Khanna-led bench told senior advocate Vijay Hansaria that the SC cannot direct the government to bring in a legislation in this regard.

Bangladesh: Dozens Of Hasina's Party Members Chased & Killed In Mob Attacks; 29 Bodies Found

Heavy rains in Brazil have led to a remarkable paleontological discovery that will astound one and all: a 233 million-year-old dinosaur fossil . This significant find was made in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul , near the town of São João do Polêsine. The fossil, which is almost fully preserved, was unearthed next to a reservoir after torrential rains eroded parts of the fossil site.The dinosaur, believed to be a member of the Herrerasauridae family , roamed the Earth during the Triassic Period when all the continents were part of a single landmass known as Pangea, also often referred to as a ""super continent"".Herrerasaurids were among the earliest carnivorous dinosaurs, and this particular specimen is estimated to have been about 2.5 meters (8 feet) long. The discovery was made by a team led by Rodrigo Temp Müller , a paleontologist from the Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM).The site where the fossil was found has been a focus of paleontological research for about 20 years. The region is known for its rich deposits of Triassic fossils, which have provided valuable insights into the early evolution of dinosaurs . The recent heavy rains accelerated the erosion process, exposing the fossil that had been buried for millions of years. According to Müller, the fossil was initially thought to be just a few isolated bones, but further excavation revealed an almost complete skeleton.This discovery is particularly significant because it is one of the oldest dinosaur fossils ever found. The oldest known dinosaur fossils date back to around 231 million years ago, making this find potentially one of the earliest examples of dinosaur evolution. The fossil’s excellent preservation allows scientists to study its anatomical details, which could provide new insights into the characteristics and behaviors of early dinosaurs. Truly an exciting find!The Herrerasauridae family, to which this dinosaur belongs, includes some of the first known carnivorous dinosaurs. These dinosaurs were bipedal, much like the Tyrannosaurus Rex, meaning they walked on two legs, and had free hands with sharp claws for catching prey. The newly discovered fossil is expected to shed light on the evolutionary adaptations that allowed these early dinosaurs to thrive in their environment.The discovery has generated excitement in the scientific community, as it could help fill gaps in our understanding of dinosaur evolution. The fossil’s advanced age and preservation make it a unique and valuable addition to the fossil record, offering a rare glimpse into the past. Researchers are now working to carefully extract the fossil from the surrounding rock and conduct detailed analyses to determine whether it represents a new species of dinosaur.The region where the fossil was found has been subject to increasingly severe weather events, including the heavy rains that led to this discovery. In June 2024, the state of Rio Grande do Sul experienced three months’ worth of rain within just two weeks, causing widespread flooding and displacing over 500,000 people. While the rains have accelerated the erosion process, they also pose a threat to newly exposed fossils, which can be damaged or destroyed if not promptly rescued.The Federal University of Santa Maria and other research institutions are now focused on preserving the fossil and conducting further studies. The findings from this discovery are expected to be published in scientific journals, contributing to our knowledge of early dinosaur evolution and the conditions that shaped their development.For the unversed, dinosaurs were a diverse group of reptiles that dominated the Earth during the Mesozoic Era, which lasted from about 252 to 66 million years ago. They were some of the most successful and varied animals ever to have lived, ranging from the small, bird-like Velociraptor to the gigantic, long-necked Brachiosaurus. Paleontologists study dinosaur fossils to learn about their behavior, diet, and appearance. Fossilized bones, teeth, footprints, and even eggs have been found, offering insights into these ancient creatures. There were over 1,000 different species of dinosaurs identified so far, ranging from the plant-eating sauropods to the fierce carnivorous theropods, showcasing their incredible diversity.Did you like this article?

He stated, ""He's a very smart guy. I certainly would, if he would do it, I certainly would. He's a brilliant guy.""Trump's consideration of Musk follows a recent two-hour interaction between the two billionaires on Musk’s social media platform.During their discussion, Musk proposed the idea of a government efficiency commission to oversee and optimise government spending. “I’d be happy to help out on such a commission,” Musk told Trump, emphasising the need for taxpayer money to be spent wisely.Trump responded positively, praising Musk’s ability to streamline operations and cut costs. “You’re the greatest cutter,” Trump said, recalling how Musk handles labour disputes by decisively managing strikes and reducing inefficiencies.This potential partnership could signal a significant collaboration between the former president and one of the most influential figures in the tech and automotive industries .Although the former president has praised Musk and may enjoy a great camaraderie with him, Trump’s stance on EV policies and manufacturing may affect the business of Tesla, owned by Musk.Trump also plans to dismantle Biden administration policies that mandate stricter emission standards and increased EV production, both of which align with Tesla's business model.Arguing that the market for EVs is limited due to cost and battery range issues, Trump’s proposed changes could pose challenges for Tesla, which has thrived under the current push for greener vehicles.",Former President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump revealed on Monday that he is open to considering Tesla CEO Elon Musk for a key role in his administration.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive.
