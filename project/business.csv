NEW DELHI: Shashi Tharoor's recent praise for Prime Minister Narendra Modi has ruffled some feathers in the Congress as fellow party leaders have questioned the move. Demanding an explanation for his praise, Tharoor's colleague Sandeep Dikshit went on to ask ""why are you in Congress"" and even termed him a ""hypocrite"".""Shashi Tharoor's problem is that I don't think he knows a lot about the country...

'One Wrong Can't Justify...': Bangladesh Expert On Elections After Sheikh Hasina Death Penalty

NEW DELHI: Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader Mahua Moitra on Wednesday courted controversy when she shared an old photo of the arrest of Bangladesh’s former poll commissioner in an election-manipulation case, saying it was a sign of ""things to come” in an apparent reference to the INDIA bloc’s allegation that the Election Commission of India (ECI) chief is ""colluding with the ruling BJP to rig elections"".Moitra, who is also the Lok Sabha MP, drew sharp retort from the BJP, which slammed her for speaking ""like an enemy of the country"".Lashing out at Mohua Moitra, BJP's national spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla said: “Mahua Moitra is a Member of Parliament of India, but she speaks like an enemy of the country. The kind of tweet she has posted now— is she trying to say that India’s democracy is like that of Bangladesh?""""Earlier too, we saw RJD leaders saying that if they lose the election, they will turn the country into Bangladesh or Nepal, creating such a situation. We have also seen Rahul Gandhi say that their fight is against the Indian State,” he told news agency ANI.Even Congress leader Rahul Gandhi attacked the ECI-led Special Intensive Revision (SIR) exercise during a meeting with AICC office-bearers from 12 states and Union Territories where the electoral roll revision is under way.He told party leaders that the Congress must counter the drive “politically, organisationally and legally,” according to sources quoted by PTI.Rahul, the sources said, argued that while the Election Commission is responsible for maintaining accurate voter rolls, it appeared to be shifting the burden onto political parties.He also questioned how the SIR was being implemented, warning that it “could lead to the removal of legitimate voters.”Several other Congress leaders echoed his fears, reviving their familiar “vote-chori” charge or calling the SIR a “sinister attempt to destroy Democracy”.Even as the opposition ramps up its resistance, the Election Commission reported that it has already distributed 50.25 crore enumeration forms across the 12 states and UTs, covering 98.54 per cent of the 50.97 crore eligible voters. The first phase spans Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Puducherry, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, and Lakshadweep.Four of these, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Kerala and West Bengal, head to the polls in 2026. Assam, also set for elections in 2026, received approval for a “special revision” of rolls on Monday.The second phase of SIR began on November 4 and will run until December 4.Rahul, meanwhile, has continued questioning the recent electoral outcomes. Last week, he termed the Bihar results “surprising” and cast doubt on the fairness of the process, saying the Congress and the INDIA bloc would scrutinise the outcome in detail. The party later alleged that the verdict reflected “vote chori on a gigantic scale, masterminded by the prime minister, the home minister, the EC”."," Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader Mahua Moitra shared an old photo of the arrest of Bangladesh’s former poll commissioner in an election-manipulation case.

"'Unconstitutional': SC strikes down Tribunal Act, slams govt",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/unconstitutional-sc-strikes-down-tribunal-act-slams-govt/articleshow/125447657.cms,"SC: Parl's discretion broad, not absolute

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court struck down Wednesday the Tribunal Reforms Act as unconstitutional and slammed the central govt for its repeated attempts to override SC's consistent rulings to shield the judicial independence of tribunals, which decide disputes in a gamut of regimes - taxation, environment, electricity, telecom and real estate.Days before his retirement, a CJI B R Gavai-led bench deprecated the Centre's repeated attempts to tinker with the qualifications, tenure and service conditions for chairpersons and members of the tribunals and took umbrage that within weeks of SC striking down the Tribunal Reforms Ordinance in July 2021, the govt tabled a bill in Parliament to enact the law whose provisions were identical to that of the ordinance.Censuring the govt for ""consciously attempting to annul the rulings"" by enacting a law that had ""cosmetically changed a few provisions"" of the annulled law, the bench of CJI Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran said, ""The Tribunal Reforms Act, 2021 is a replica of the struck-down ordinance; old wine in a new bottle, the wine whets not the judicial palate, but the bottle merely dazzles.""The verdict means that, pending the enactment of a new law, the service conditions of tribunal presidents and members would be governed by their parent Acts.For example, ITAT Act would govern service conditions of ITAT president and members.Writing the judgment, CJI Gavai said, ""The provisions of the impugned Act cannot be sustained. They violate the constitutional principles of separation of powers and judicial independence.""The Supreme Court said the Act directly contradicts binding judicial pronouncements that have repeatedly clarified the standards governing the appointment, tenure and functioning of tribunal members. The bench said that the Act, which intended to usher in uniformity in tenure and service conditions of all tribunal members, undermined the constitutional requirements of independence and impartiality of tribunals by enabling the executive to exercise control over them.The Supreme Court said, ""Where Parliament reenacts provisions previously struck down without curing the underlying defect, the resulting legislation remains vulnerable to invalidation, not because the Court is imposing its own policy, but because the Constitution itself demands adherence to these structural safeguards.""""The Indian constitutional framework does not subscribe to parliamentary sovereignty, nor does it vest unqualified supremacy in the judiciary.""The architecture of our Constitution is firmly rooted in the principle of constitutional supremacy.""It said that when SC interprets the Constitution and pronounces upon the validity of a law, that pronouncement becomes the authoritative and binding declaration of the law.""Once the court has struck down a provision or issued binding directions after identifying a constitutional defect, Parliament cannot simply override or contradict that judicial decision by re-enacting the very same measure in a different form,"" CJI Gavai said.Supreme Court said Parliament's discretion is broad but not absolute.","Supreme Court said Parliament's discretion is broad but not absolute.

PM Modi Predicts Major Congress Split After NDA’s Bihar Win And Warns Allies Of Growing Instability

Also read:

NEW DELHI: A group of 272 eminent citizens, including 16 judges, 123 retired bureaucrats, 14 former ambassadors and 133 retired armed forces officers, issued an open letter accusing leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi and the Congress of trying to erode public faith in the Election Commission and other constitutional institutions.The letter, titled ""Assault on National Constitutional Authorities,"" alleged that opposition leaders were attempting to manufacture a sense of institutional breakdown through what it described as “venomous rhetoric” and “provocative but unsubstantiated accusations.”The letter said: “Some political leaders, instead of offering genuine policy alternative, resort to provocative but unsubstantiated accusations in their theatrical political strategy. After their attempts to tarnish the Indian Armed Forces by questioning their valour and accomplishments, and the Judiciary by questioning its fairness, Parliament, and its constitutional functionaries, now it is the turn of Election Commission of India to face systematic and conspiratorial attacks on its integrity and reputation.”The signatories singled out Rahul Gandhi for repeatedly alleging vote theft while, they said, failing to file a formal complaint or sworn affidavit to back his claims. They pointed to his assertions that he had “100 per cent proof” and an “atom bomb” against the Commission, alongside accusations of “treason,” and argued that such remarks came “without the prescribed sworn affidavit” required for accountability.The letter also noted that similar accusations had been amplified by Congress leaders, opposition parties and allied NGOs, including claims that the Election Commission had acted like the “B-team of the BJP.” It argued these assertions collapsed under scrutiny, pointing to the ECI’s public release of its methodology and verification done under court oversight.It said, “Moreover, several senior figures of Congress and other political parties, leftist NGOs, ideologically opinionated scholars, and a few attention seekers in other walks of life, have joined in with similarly blistering rhetoric against SIR, even declaring that the Commission has descended into complete shamelessness by acting like the ‘B-team of the BJP.’ Such fiery rhetoric may be emotionally powerful but it collapses under scrutiny, because the ECI has publicly shared its SIR methodology, overseen verification by court-sanctioned means, removed ineligible names in a compliant manner, and added new eligible voters. ”The signatories described this pattern of criticism as “impotent rage,” stating that leaders who faced electoral setbacks “lash out at institutions instead of rebuilding their credibility.”The letter said, “This pattern of behaviour reflects what might be called ‘impotent rage’ deep anger born of repeated electoral failure and frustration, without a concrete plan to reconnect with the people. When political leaders lose touch with the aspirations of ordinary citizens, they lash out at institutions instead of rebuilding their credibility. Theatrics replace analysis. Public spectacle takes the place of public service. ”Invoking the legacy of former chief election commissioners TN Seshan and N Gopalaswami, the letter said, “Today, thinking of ECI, the country also remembers the likes of TN Seshan and N Gopalaswami, whose unyielding leadership transformed the Election Commission into a formidable constitutional sentinel. They did not court popularity. They did not chase headlines. They enforced the rules fearlessly, impartially, relentlessly. ”Calling for transparency, legal accountability and respectful political conduct, the letter concluded by saying, “We call upon the Election Commission to continue its path of transparency and rigour. Publish complete data, defend itself through legal channels when necessary, and reject politics dressed up as victimhood. We call upon political leaders to respect the constitutional process, to compete not through baseless accusation but through policy articulation, and to accept democratic verdicts with grace. ”"," 272 eminent citizens, including 16 judges, 123 retired bureaucrats, 14 former ambassadors and 133 retired armed forces officers, issued an open letter.

This will give a major boost to the rural economy of the country,"" he said.Highlighting policy interventions in recent years, he added, ""In the last 11 years, there has been a massive transformation in the entire agriculture sector of the country. Our agricultural export has almost doubled. To make agriculture modern, government has thrown open all paths to support the farmers.""PM Modi also talked about maintaining soil fertility amid increasing demand for agricultural products saying, ""In recent years, the increasing demand for agricultural products has led to a rapid rise in the use of various chemicals in the sector. As a result, soil fertility is deteriorating, and the cost of farming is escalating. The solution lies in adopting crop diversification and natural farming practices. To restore soil fertility and enhance the nutritional value of crops, we must embrace natural farming methods. This approach is not only a necessity, but also a part of our vision for sustainable agriculture.""On a sidenote, as the Prime Minister noticed two girl students waving placards praising him, he asked security personnel to bring the placards to him, and lauded the students.Before the address, PM Modi inaugurated the South India Natural Farming Summit and interacted with local farmers. He also inspected an exhibition displaying agricultural products and plant growth demonstrations, accompanied by Tamil Nadu Governor RN Ravi.The summit, being held from November 19 to 21, has been organised by the Tamil Nadu Natural Farming Stakeholders Forum. It aims to promote sustainable, eco-friendly and chemical-free farming, and to accelerate the shift towards natural and regenerative agriculture as a climate-smart and economically viable model. It will also focus on creating market linkages for farmer-producer organisations and rural entrepreneurs, while showcasing innovations in organic inputs, agro-processing, eco-friendly packaging and indigenous technologies. Over 50,000 farmers, practitioners, scientists, sellers and stakeholders from Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Kerala, Telangana, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh are expected to participate.Earlier in the day, PM Modi visited Andhra Pradesh to participate in the birth centenary celebrations of Sri Satya Sai Baba. Addressing the gathering, he said that devotion without service, knowledge without compassion, and action without societal contribution hold no meaning.",Prime Minister Narendra Modi said India is on the path to becoming a global hub of natural farming. He said the agriculture sector has undergone a major transformation over the last 11 years and that agricultural exports have “almost doubled” PM Modi said natural farming is a subject “very close” to his heart.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125438600,imgsize-961178,width-400,resizemode-4/article-28.jpg"

NEW DELHI: In a major reform to strengthen aviation safety oversight and better protect air travellers’ interests, India has set the old plan of restructuring the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) into a financially and administratively autonomous organisation like SEBI or TRAI into motion. A Parliamentary panel had sought the restructuring to give teeth to the regulator as air traffic has grown exponentially in the last decade while in its current setup the DGCA battles legacy issues like staff shortage which can’t be tackled at the required pace.Based on the parliamentary committee’s advice and directions of the Union aviation ministry, the DGCA prepared a report outlining its proposed restructuring. The same is learnt to have been submitted this week to the ministry, including secretary Samir Kumar Sinha who is keen on having an autonomous aviation regulatory body on the lines of telecom and securities market regulators (TRAI & SEBI). Highly placed sources say the restructuring will happen in a “staggered manner” after the ministry takes a view on the DGCA report.It is learnt that the proposed restructuring of DGCA into CAA may also put in place a dedicated system to protect consumer interests and ensure their grievances are promptly redressed.The proposed CAA with statutory status will also see the latter getting a funding mechanism with the options being levying a small charge on flyers. A self-funded regulator not dependent on govt for grants will be able to offer market-linked salaries competitively to attract talent and invest in latest technology for effective oversight.The idea of having a truly autonomous Civil Aviation Authority has been in the works for years but it has got a push in recent times due to the growth in India’s air traffic with airlines having close to 2,000 planes on order; dozens of new airports opening and the skies getting crowded requiring more safety oversight.DGCA manpower didn’t keep pace with the growing air traffic. It recently started creating a “pool” of its retired technical officers “to provide advisory support in the certification process” due to the manpower crunch. “It has often been observed that applicants and entities face difficulties navigating the entire process, leading to delays and compliance challenges,” the regulator admits in its note for creating this pool.",India has set the old plan of restructuring the Directorate General of Civil Aviation into a financially and administratively autonomous organisation like SEBI or TRAI into motion.

Surat evaluates electric freight vehicles under clean air programme,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/surat-evaluates-electric-freight-operations-under-clean-air-programme/articleshow/125439609.cms,"Representative AI image

Surat recently concluded a pilot programme testing electric freight vehicles at the Surat Textile Market to assess their feasibility and potential to cut emissions from commercial transport.The initiative involved deployment of electric small commercial vehicles (e-SCVs) and light commercial vehicles (e-LCVs) across multiple logistics stages in the market, one of the city's largest trading hubs. While full data analysis is still in progress, preliminary findings suggest lower operating costs and reduced tailpipe emissions compared to conventional diesel vehicles.The pilot forms part of the Surat Municipal Corporation’s measures under the National Clean Air Programme. The project was undertaken in collaboration with WRI India, Federation of Surat Textile Traders Association (FOSTTA), Switch Mobility and Euler Motors.Surat, which accounts for nearly 40 per cent of India’s man-made fabric production, sees around 21,000 freight trips daily across 250 markets. According to officials, the majority of these trips are handled by over 7,500 diesel, petrol and CNG-powered vehicles, contributing substantially to local emissions.Representatives from the textile traders' associations and partner organisations said the pilot offers insights on fleet operations and could help inform future policy and investments in commercial e-mobility. The programme is part of WRI India’s Accelerator for Clean Air Actions and a larger UNEP-led project supported by the Global Environment Facility, with guidance from NITI Aayog.","Surat, which accounts for nearly 40 per cent of India’s man-made fabric production, sees around 21,000 freight trips daily across 250 markets.

PM Modi's BIG OUTREACH To India's Farmers, Launches Agri Schemes Worth ₹35,000 Crore Before Diwali

NEW DELHI: Civil society organisations and farmer groups on Tuesday expressed their concerns over the proposed amendments to the international plant genetic resources treaty, saying the changes would lead to the opening up of almost all of India’s genetic resources related to agriculture and food to seed companies of developed countries.They jointly wrote to Union ministers Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Bhupender Yadav, flagging that the move at the upcoming global forum in Peru would in effect dismantle India’s ability to determine how, when and by whom its agricultural genetic resources are accessed.The issues, including the proposed amendment, is scheduled to be discussed at the upcoming 11th session of the governing body of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA) in Lima, Peru, during Nov 24-29.The organisations, led by Asha (Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture) Kisan Swaraj, demanded that the govt appoint a well experienced multilateral negotiator to attend negotiations in Lima, who can protect the nation’s interests, especially the interests of the custodians of plant genetic resources, the country’s farmers.In their letter to the ministers, the civil society groups said, ""The draft package, if adopted, will force India to share the genetic wealth with the Global North (developed countries) where the big agribusiness, big tech, multinational seed companies, biotech industry, major gene banks, and research organizations are located, but without accountability and transparency measures in place.""As these actors would be able to access all the Indian Plant Germplasm from national collections, international gene banks, and CGIAR institutions without informing the national authorities of the provider countries, and they will have to just sign a precarious Standard Material Transfer Agreement (SMTA) adopted by the GB of the Plant Treaty.""Their letter came days after a group of scientists wrote a similar letter to Chouhan. The scientists raised objections over a proposed move to tweak provisions of benefit sharing on use of genetic resources. The scientists flagged that the current proposals to “enhance” the treaty's multilateral system are fundamentally unjust and pose an immediate, existential threat to India’s sovereign rights over its vast genetic wealth and the fundamental rights of its farmers.Genetic resources are currently shared under law for research and advancements in medicine and agriculture. It is largely believed that the full access to such resources, instead of a negotiated access, could significantly compromise the nation’s sovereign rights over its own genetic resources and override domestic legislation, like India’s Biodiversity Act.","Civil society organisations and farmer groups expressed their concerns over the proposed amendments to the international plant genetic resources treaty.

ED Cracks Down On ‘White-Collar Terror Module’, Conducts 25 Raids Linked To Al-Falah University

Cheating, forgery, fraud

FARIDABAD: Crores of rupees were allegedly siphoned off by the Al-Falah trust to family-linked entities, with contracts for construction and catering awarded to companies owned by chairman Jawad Siddiqui’s wife and children, ED sources said.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Tuesday arrested Jawad Ahmed Siddiqui, chairman of the Al-Falah group — the entity that runs the hospital in Faridabad where the suicide bomber behind the Red Fort car blast and other accused in the case were employed.Siddiqui has been sent to 13-day ED custody.Also read: Delhi Red Fort blast accused Umar Un Nabi’s chilling radicalisation video surfaces According to news agency ANI, the court noted that ED presented extensive financial analysis showing that between FY 2018–19 and 2024–25, the Al-Falah institutions generated approximately Rs 415.10 crore in education-related receipts.These funds, ED argues, constitute proceeds of crime because they were collected during periods when the University was publicly misrepresenting its accreditation and statutory status.The court observed that this money was allegedly obtained directly through cheating, forgery, and use of fabricated documents—scheduled offences under PMLA.According to the ED, the money was allegedly obtained through cheating, forgery and use of fabricated documents—offences scheduled under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).The court observed that the investigation is still at an “nascent stage” but described the alleged financial offences as “grave.”It said custodial interrogation was necessary to trace further proceeds of crime, prevent dissipation of tainted assets, and avoid potential interference with witnesses or destruction of records.Siddiqui was booked under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) following a day-long search on at least 19 premises belonging to Al-Falah University and associated entities. The search also covered the residential premises of key persons in the group.“The arrest took place following a detailed investigation and analysis of evidence gathered during searches conducted on premises related to Al-Falah group in the ongoing money laundering probe and after establishing Siddiqui’s culpability in the offence,” ED said late on Tuesday.During the raids, the agency seized over ₹48 lakh in cash, multiple digital devices, and documentary evidence. Investigators also identified multiple shell companies and uncovered numerous violations allegedly committed by the group.Also read: ‘Doctor blowing himself up unsettles me’- Iltija Mufti on Delhi blast, says Kashmiris trapped in vicious cycle The ED initiated its probe following two FIRs registered by the Delhi Police Crime Branch, which alleged that Al-Falah University had made fraudulent claims about NAAC and UGC accreditation to mislead students, parents, and other stakeholders. The FIRs claimed the motive was to wrongfully gain financially and cause losses to students and the public.The UGC had earlier clarified that Al-Falah University is included only under Section 2(f) as a State Private University, has never applied under Section 12(B), and is not eligible for grants under that provision.The ED’s arrest of Siddiqui marks a major step in the ongoing probe into financial irregularities and fraudulent practices at the Al-Falah group, including the alleged diversion of crores of rupees to family-linked entities.The ED also searched 25 premises connected to the Al-Falah group, which runs a hospital and medical college in Faridabad, among others, on Tuesday when Siddiqui was arrested.The ED told the court that Al-Falah University chairman Jawad Ahmad Siddiqui had complete control of the Al-Falah trust and the university, including various companies allegedly used to divert trust funds.At least nine shell entities with no business activities, all controlled by Siddiqui, have been identified.During the searches on the Al-Falah University premises, a hard disk containing back-up of all the digital devices, tally data, etc. was found hidden in the library and was seized along with other documents, sources said.","Jawad Ahmed Siddiqui, chairman of the Al-Falah group, was arrested on Tuesday.

Trump Admits Soft Spot for Elon Musk Despite Explosive Rift, Epstein Claims, and Public Attacks

Why Musk’s presence at Trump’s dinner is gaining attention







Tesla CEO Elon Musk was among the industry leaders and other guests who attended a high-profile dinner hosted by US President Donald Trump at the White House, marking a public reunion for the two powerful figures following a bitter public feud earlier this year. The gathering appears to signal a potential reunion between the billionaire business leader and the President.Musk had a dramatic falling out with the President earlier in the year. The CEO publicly attacked Trump’s sweeping tax and spending bill as “fiscally reckless” and threatened to form a new political party. Trump responded by threatening to cut billions of dollars in federal subsidies received by Musk's companies. Public appearances of both together have been rare since the conflict. Previously, Musk was spotted shaking hands with Trump at a memorial event in September. This dinner is the second public appearance of both of them together after the feud, which was cited by analysts as a factor that negatively impacted Tesla's brand, sales, and stock price.Musk was an early supporter and close advisor to the Trump administration, even leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and overseeing federal cuts.Musk’s attendance at Tuesday night’s dinner – his first public White House visit since the fallout – drew immediate attention. A video shared widely on X captured the moment President Trump, accompanied by Melania Trump and the Saudi Crown Prince, spotted Musk. Trump was seen gently tapping the Tesla boss, to which Musk responded with a nod.The moment was quickly framed by social media commentators as a definitive end to the public spat. Nick Sortor, who shared the video on X, wrote, “President Trump tapped Elon Musk on his way in to the White House dinner tonight. Elon’s reaction says it all. The bros are back together.”The dinner hosted by President Trump was part of efforts to deepen ties with the Saudi leader. Other distinguished guests at the event included Portugal’s football star Cristiano Ronaldo and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. OpenAI president and co-founder Greg Brockman also shared a photo with Elon and Huang, captioning it, ""the future is bright.""","Tesla CEO Elon Musk attended a high-profile dinner hosted by US President Donald Trump at the White House.

""Us and everyone else.""

What Arrowhead CEO said about the impacts of GTA 6 delay



""blot out the sun in a way unimaginable for everyone else.""

""another six months of uninterrupted work without GTA looming over us,”

""GTA has obviously been very hard to avoid.""

“everyone would move out of the way”





Rockstar Games once again delayed the launch of the highly anticipated title, Grand Theft Auto (GTA) 6, earlier this month. The Take Two Interactive-owned game developer has now pushed the release to November 2026. However, the delay has not only disappointed GTA fans but has also significantly impacted competing game development studios as they plan their own content releases. The delay has offered Rockstar rival studios a window of relief. Speaking to The Game Business, Shams Jorjani, CEO of Arrowhead Game Studios, the developer of Helldivers 2, acknowledged that the delay affects his studio's operational planning. He stated,adding,Jorjani described the eventual release of GTA 6 as an event that willHowever, the six-month postponement provides Arrowhead withhe noted. While studios typically try to plan content without major external influences, Jorjani admitted thatApart from Arrowhead, many others in the games industry are feeling the impact of GTA 6’s looming arrival. A veteran Saints Row developer recently said Rockstar is challenging to compete with, reflecting a concern shared across studios.As GTA 6’s release date continues to shift, developers have been adjusting their schedules to avoid overlapping with Rockstar’s major launch. Even Hideo Kojima noted thatfor the game.According to a report by IGN, Rhys Elliott, head of market analysis at Alinea Analytics, has also warned that GTA could draw engagement and revenue away from existing live-service titles such as Fortnite and Roblox, which are always competing for players’ attention.While some studios typically avoid factoring in competing releases, GTA 6 breaks that approach given its expected scale. However, one analyst believes its launch may still not address the industry’s broader challenges.Attention also remains on Rockstar’s internal issues. The company recently let go of over 30 employees, prompting the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain to accuse it of union-busting. In response, more than 200 current Rockstar staff members have signed letters calling for the reinstatement of their former colleagues.Moreover, recent rumours also claim that GTA 6 may launch on Nintendo's latest Switch 2 consoles.This week, Rockstar announced the latest GTA Online update, which brings new Listings Missions, a free executive office, property and vehicle discounts alongside several additional offers.",Rockstar Games has pushed the release date of Grand Theft Auto 6 to November 2026.

A room full of startup founders and investors at the world's biggest AI conference votes ChatGPT-maker OpenAI among 'likely flops',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/worlds-biggest-ai-conference-votes-sam-altmans-openai-among-likely-flops/articleshow/125364076.cms,"Representative Image

Why AI professionals are thinking that OpenAI may turn out to be a ‘flop’





OpenAI's Master Plan for India

""How can a company with $13 billion in revenues make $1.4 trillion of spend commitments?""

""If you want to sell your shares, I'll find you a buyer. Enough,”

""Geeze, it sounds more like the judgmental valley conference.""





ChatGPT maker OpenAI was voted among the startups with potential to 'FAIL' in an informal survey at the Cerebral Valley AI Conference. The result offers an unexpected perspective on the ChatGPT maker that has $100-plus valuation. The survey asked founders and investors which AI startup they would be willing to bet against, a question not typically raised so openly in Silicon Valley. AI search startup Perplexity received the most votes, followed by ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. Meanwhile, when the audience was asked whether they could invest in any private technology company, most people voted for the Claude maker Anthropic, while OpenAI took second place.According to a Business Insider report, independent journalist Eric Newcomer conducted the survey by gathering responses from more than 300 attendees before panels featuring other major AI companies, such as Anthropic and xAI. This shows that some industry professionals are becoming more cautious about the success of AI startups. Even with a lot of money going into AI, there is now some doubt about how well certain big companies in the field will do.OpenAI taking second place on the list may seem unexpected because it is often viewed as a consumer-focused leader in the AI space. However, its rapidly rising valuation and significant infrastructure costs have raised concerns for some investors. Even though Sam Altman has acknowledged the possibility of an AI bubble, OpenAI CEO rejected the idea that his company’s valuation is overstated during a recent conversation with investor Brad Gerstner.Gerstner asked Altman at the interview.Altman replied.Altman noted that interest in the company remains strong. In fact, both OpenAI and Perplexity were popular choices in another part of the survey that asked which companies respondents would be willing to bet on.Perplexity, which also offers an AI-powered search browser, is aiming to compete with Google, and being ranked first on the list is not unexpected.Perplexity has become a typical example in discussions about the possibility of an AI bubble, as it has raised frequent funding rounds and attracted strong investor interest at valuations reported to range from $14 billion to $50 billion, according to the report.When asked about the Cerebral Valley survey, Perplexity spokesperson Jesse Dwyer responded in an email:However, it's important to note that any informal, anonymous survey should be viewed cautiously. Yet, the results offer insight into private opinions, as many founders and investors discuss concerns about an AI bubble but rarely mention specific companies.Unlike public markets, private investors do not typically bet against startups, and openly criticising a company without clear justification is generally discouraged in Silicon Valley.","ChatGPT maker OpenAI was voted among the startups with potential to 'FAIL' in an informal survey at the Cerebral Valley AI Conference.

India’s central bank should shift away from its neutral monetary policy stance and deliver around 50 basis points of rate cuts over the next 12 months, according to a report by French asset manager Amundi.As per news agency ANI, the firm said the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) may need to act as economic growth could begin to soften in 2026 due to US tariffs that place India at a disadvantage compared to regional peers.Amundi noted that domestic demand “remains the principal growth driver,” adding that despite the recent upgrade to GDP forecasts, it “continues to expect some deceleration in Calendar Year (CY) 26”.The report said the tariff burden on India is expected to ease in 2026, with growth likely to stay supported by domestic demand and aided by upcoming fiscal relief measures.According to the report, these measures include changes in the Goods and Services Tax (GST), lower income taxes, and the expected rollout of the Eighth Pay Commission by January 2026, steps that are likely to boost household consumption.However, Amundi highlighted that the recovery in private investment remains uneven and has recently been “disappointing” amid elevated global uncertainty.The report added that deregulation efforts could help revive the investment cycle, though external headwinds remain the biggest downside risk without stronger fiscal support.On inflation, Amundi expects headline price pressures to average between 4–5 per cent in CY26, supported by a favourable monsoon, soft global food and energy prices, and pass-through effects of GST changes.On the market outlook, the asset manager maintained a “slightly positive” view on Indian equities, as per ANI.It sees potential in infrastructure projects aimed at easing real bottlenecks, manufacturing aligned with global supply-chain shifts, and technologies that support financial inclusion.",The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) may need to act as economic growth could begin to soften in 2026 due to US tariffs that place India at a disadvantage compared to regional peers.

Trump's H-1B U-Turn: From 'America First' To ‘US Lacks Talent’ Shocker; MAGA Stunned

NEW DELHI: Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai has reaffirmed the vital role of immigrants in the growth of the United States technology sector, calling their contribution “phenomenal” at a time when the H-1B visa system is at the centre of renewed political debate.In an interview with the BBC, Pichai said, ""If you look at the history of technology development, the contribution of immigrants to the sector has been nothing but phenomenal."" He acknowledged the H-1B programme’s ""shortcomings"" but said the administration is working to resolve them. ""I think there's a framework by which we all can still bring talented individuals. I think they're making changes to address some of the shortcomings in the current programme,"" he added.Pichai, who first arrived in the US as an international student and later secured an H-1B visa before rising to lead Google and its parent company, has long been a vocal supporter of immigration.During the interview, he was also questioned about the growing influence of technology leaders. The reporter referred to a photograph of Pichai, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk in seats of honour at the president's inauguration and asked whether the proximity between political power and Big Tech made people uncomfortable.Pichai said, ""It is an extraordinary moment in terms of this AI technology. I think, you know, it has tremendous opportunities to deliver benefits to the economy. It matters from a national security standpoint in the US president Trump has been very clear in the importance of this technology and has articulated a clear AI action plan with multiple aspects to it to deliver benefits to the country and not just us, the leading companies which are building this technology. I think it's important we are engaging with the government in a way that this technology is going to translate to deliver benefits for society, including thinking through concerns around potential misuse of the technology.""He was later asked specifically about the White House's crackdown on foreign worker visas and how it might affect the sector, given his own journey on an H-1B visa. Pichai said, ""If you look at the history of technology development, the contribution of immigrants to the sector has been nothing but phenomenal. But I do think the government understands it. I think there's a framework by which we all can still bring talented individuals. I think they're making changes to address some of the shortcomings in the current program, and I think we'll be able to continue investing.""The debate around the visa programme intensified after President Donald Trump proposed a 100,000 dollar fee for new H-1B applications in September. The White House has said the goal is to curb misuse in the system, not eliminate it.Meanwhile, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene has announced plans to introduce legislation to ""completely eliminate"" the H-1B programme and end its pathway to permanent residency. She said the change would ""force"" immigrants to ""return home"" after their visas expire. Her bill includes a single exemption that allows up to 10,000 visas a year for doctors, nurses and other medical professionals.If enacted, the proposal would heavily impact Indian professionals, who represent more than 70 per cent of approved H-1B petitions in recent years due to strong demand for skilled workers in STEM fields and better opportunities in the US.","Google CEO Sundar Pichai has reaffirmed the vital role of immigrants in the growth of the United States technology sector.

At the fundamental level the picture of ‘strong macros but weak micros’ at the beginning of the year is changing to ‘ strong macros and improving micros’.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
Market watch: Asian stocks surge on Nvidia boost; crude prices edge higher,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/market-watch-asian-stocks-surge-on-nvidia-boost-crude-prices-edge-higher/articleshow/125452245.cms,"AI image

Asian markets jumped on Thursday as strong earnings from Nvidia lifted sentiment and eased fears of an AI-driven bubble, even as investors tempered expectations for a December rate cut following signals from the US Federal Reserve.According to news agency AFP, Nvidia’s quarterly results and upbeat comments from CEO Jensen Huang — who said “we see something very different” when asked about an AI bubble — helped soothe concerns over overstretched tech valuations.Shares of the chipmaker rose more than five percent in post-market trade, pushing S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures higher.The rally spilled over into Asia, where tech firms led gains. Samsung, SK hynix, TSMC and SoftBank all surged, while Tokyo’s Nikkei briefly jumped more than four percent.Markets in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Sydney, Singapore, Wellington and Jakarta were also higher.As per Reuters, MSCI’s Asia-Pacific ex-Japan index rebounded 0.6%, while Nvidia “delivered yet another master class in AI dominance,” according to IG analyst Tony Sycamore.Strong moves were seen across chip-related stocks, with Japan’s SoftBank soaring as much as 8% and Taiwan’s TSMC advancing more than 4%.The rally helped offset pressure from the Fed’s October meeting minutes, which showed officials leaning against a third consecutive rate cut next month, as per AFP.Traders, according to Reuters, sharply scaled back expectations for a December reduction to about 33%, after the US delayed its September jobs report and postponed the October data release until December 16.The shift pushed the dollar higher and it rose to 157.47 yen.Crude prices also edged up. Brent rose 0.33% to $63.72 a barrel and WTI gained 0.40% to $59.68 as markets assessed new US proposals to end the war in Ukraine and prepared for a November 21 deadline for companies to cease operations with Rosneft and Lukoil under Washington’s sanctions.The rebound followed nearly 2% losses a day earlier, with IG’s Sycamore saying crude retains a “bullish bias” above $55.","Shares of the chipmaker rose more than five percent in post-market trade, pushing S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures higher.

From presidential hopeful to California contender

An agenda centred on affordability and reform

A crowded Democratic field – and rising Republican challenges





Tom Steyer, the billionaire environmental activist and one of the Democratic party’s biggest political donors, has announced his bid for California governor, joining a rapidly expanding field looking to replace the termed-out Gavin Newsom. Steyer, who previously ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, said he is entering the race to tackle what he calls the state’s “intractable affordability crisis”.Steyer, 68, built his fortune in finance after founding Farallon Capital Management in 1986, turning it into one of the world’s most influential hedge funds. But he left the firm in 2012 to devote himself full-time to political and environmental causes. He went on to create NextGen America, a youth-focused voter mobilisation organisation centred on climate change, reproductive rights and progressive policy.He has since become one of the largest donors to Democratic candidates and initiatives across the US, spending millions on campaigns and ballot measures.Steyer’s most high-profile political moment came in 2020 when he sought the Democratic nomination for president.His campaign emphasised climate action, corporate accountability and economic fairness, but he dropped out after finishing behind Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders in the South Carolina primary.In the years since, he has remained deeply involved in California politics. He spent more than $12m supporting the state’s recent redistricting measure and has championed legislation aimed at raising the tobacco tax, closing corporate tax loopholes, and funding healthcare programmes. His political résumé also includes leading statewide campaigns that target oil, tobacco and out-of-state corporations.Announcing his candidacy, Steyer pledged sweeping reforms designed to ease the cost-of-living crisis gripping the state. He has promised to lower utility bills, build one million homes within four years, make pre-school and community college free, and ban corporate PAC money in California elections.“Californians deserve a life they can afford,” he said. “The people who make this state run are being run over by rising costs. It’s time corporations paid their fair share again.”With Gavin Newsom unable to run again, the Democratic field is unusually packed. Contenders include former congresswoman Katie Porter, former US cabinet member Xavier Becerra, former Los Angeles mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, and former state controller Betty Yee. Congressman Eric Swalwell is also expected to join the race.Porter had previously been viewed as the frontrunner until a damaging video incident in October, after which Republican challenger Chad Bianco, the Riverside county sheriff, surged in polls. Another prominent Republican, former Fox News host Steve Hilton, is also in the running.","Steyer, 68, built his fortune in finance after founding Farallon Capital Management in 1986.

This choice, while reflecting their divergent views on policing, underscores a shared commitment to enhancing public safety and reducing crime.

HISTORIC: Zohran Mamdani Elected New York City's First Indian-American Muslim Mayor





New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani announced on Wednesday that Jessica Tisch has accepted his offer to remain as commissioner of the NYPD, securing one of his highest-profile appointments ahead of taking office in January.Tisch was appointed by outgoing mayor Eric Adams and has led the nation’s largest police force through a record drop in crime, including reductions in shootings and homicides.“Leading this department is the greatest privilege of my life, and I am proud to continue doing it,” Tisch wrote in a letter to the NYPD obtained by CNN. “Now, do the Mayor-elect and I agree on everything? No, we don’t. But in speaking with him, it’s clear that we share broad and crucial priorities: the importance of public safety, the need to continue driving down crime, and the need to maintain stability and order across the department. We also agree that you deserve the city’s respect and support.”The decision required compromise from both Tisch and Mamdani, both of them have differing views on policing. Mamdani once supported defunding the police and later apologised to officers during his mayoral run. Tisch is known as a technocrat who has pushed to roll back criminal justice reforms.On Wednesday, Mamdani and Tisch appeared together at the Fallen Heroes Memorial in Lower Manhattan.They were joined by officers who shook hands with the mayor-elect while paying tribute to those killed in the line of duty. “I appreciate the moments I just shared with Commissioner Tisch and a number of officers here with us to pay our respects to NYPD officers who lost their lives in the line of duty and to learn a little bit more about the names that so many New Yorkers have come to know,” Mamdani said.Tisch praised the visit as meaningful, saying, “To me it is very meaningful that he asked to come here as our first public venture to visit the memorial.”Mamdani’s proposed reforms include creating a Department of Community Safety to respond to non-violent emergency calls such as mental health crises, domestic violence, and homelessness. He suggested Tisch supports the plan. “It’s untenable for officers to be asked to respond to the 200,000 mental health calls they receive every year… The commissioner and I share a belief that in order for police officers to be able to do their jobs we also need to create a Department of Community Safety,” he said.Despite Tisch’s acceptance, concerns persist among NYPD officers about morale and retention. Police union leaders have warned of rising departures, citing a 35 per cent increase in October compared to last year.Tisch is an heiress to the Loews family fortune and previously served as commissioner of the sanitation department and the city’s chief technology officer. She has overseen efforts to remove thousands of illegal guns from city streets and has avoided commenting on politics or the mayoral race during the campaign.",Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani announced on Wednesday that Jessica Tisch has accepted his offer to remain as commissioner of the NYPD.

Visa Breach Ends India Visit for Blacklisted UK Scholar and Hindi Literature Expert Francesca Orsini





: PoK-origin UK home secretary Shabana Mahmood announced Monday that Trump-style visa bans will be imposed on countries unless they accept the return of their criminals and illegal immigrants, as she revealed further sweeping reforms to tackle illegal immigration.The first countries to face such a ban are Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo whose nationals will no longer be granted UK visas unless their govts rapidly improve cooperation on removals. “These countries face penalties for their unacceptably low co-operation and obstructive returns processes. Thousands of illegal migrants and criminals from these nations are currently in the UK,” the home office said.Non-cooperation includes embassies failing to process removals paperwork in time and requiring individuals to sign their own documentation — allowing them to block their own deportation.India is thought to be one of several other countries most resistant to taking back illegal migrants and could join the list over the coming year, the Times (UK) reported.Human rights laws will also be overhauled to scale up deportations and prevent migrants from “gaming the system”.UK’s govt will legislate to reform how Article 8 (the right to family and private life) is interpreted by the courts to make clear a family connection means immediate family, such as a parent or child — blocking people from using dubious connections to stay in the UK. It will also work with partners at the Council of Europe to address the “over-expansive application” of Article 3 (protection against inhuman and degrading treatments) which migrants are also using to block their removal and introduce new legislation to crack down on “migrants making last-minute bogus modern slavery claims”. Migrants will be restricted to arguing all legal grounds within a single appeal and, if they lose, they will be forced to leave.New capped work and study routes for genuine refugees will be created who will be referred through partners such as the UNHCR. British people will be encouraged to house them, as they have done for Ukrainians, to end the reliance on asylum hotels, which cost £2.1 billion in 2024-2025.In the year ending June 2025 a total of 5,475 Indian nationals claimed asylum in the UK making them the sixth-largest nationality. Of these, 346 Indians arrived by small boat illegally. The other Indians were mostly on visas, with student visas being the most common. The top nationality to claim asylum was Pakistani; followed by nationals from Afghanistan, Iran, Eritrea and Bangladesh.Only 20 Indians were granted asylum in the year ending June 2025, and 2,691 had their claims refused.","Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo will face visa bans unless they accept the return of their criminals and illegal immigrants.
