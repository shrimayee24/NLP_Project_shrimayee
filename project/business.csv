The Ministry of Tourism, responsible for regulating hospitality services.

The Ministry of Municipalities and Housing, contributing to urban planning and infrastructure readiness.





To streamline the accommodation process for Hajj 2026, Saudi Arabia has rolled out a seasonal licensing system for pilgrim housing in Makkah and Madinah. The initiative, developed through inter-ministerial collaboration, focuses on enhancing service standards, ensuring compliance, and organizing bookings through official digital platforms.The Ministry of Hajj and Umrah has formally introduced a temporary hostel licensing service for accommodations specifically catering to pilgrims in Makkah and Madinah during the upcoming Hajj season of 1447 AH (2026). This seasonal licensing model has been jointly developed with two other key government bodies, the Ministry of Tourism and the Ministry of Municipalities and Housing — in a coordinated and streamlined governmental effort to efficiently manage the large influx of pilgrims more effectively and safely.Unlike permanent hotel licenses, this new initiative targets properties seeking short-term regulatory approval specifically for the Hajj period. Existing hotel establishments with active, year-round licenses issued officially by the Ministry of Tourism are exempt from this seasonal licensing process entirely.To obtain a license under the new system, applicants must complete two steps:The deadline for securing the necessary license is 13th Sha'ban 1447 AH, corresponding to February 1, 2026.All licenses must be finalized before this contracting period closes. No applications will be accepted beyond this date.The temporary hostel licensing system has been introduced to:By creating a standardized process and tying it to official digital infrastructure, the authorities aim to deliver a smoother, more reliable lodging experience for pilgrims.This licensing overhaul reflects a high level of coordination between:Together, these entities have designed a system that balances religious, administrative, and tourism-related requirements, making it easier for property owners and service providers to align with national Hajj goals.","Saudi Arabia has rolled out a seasonal licensing system for pilgrim housing in Makkah and Madinah.

Kids’ cough syrup deaths trigger multi-state checks

BHOPAL/NEW DELHI: As the number of children dying of renal failure in MP’s Chhindwara district after consumption of cough syrup rose to 11, with two more fatalities reported on Saturday, a laboratory test report of Coldrif — the cough medicine taken by some of the victims — has revealed it contained a poisonous industrial chemical, prompting the state to ban its sale.The report received by MP government from Tamil Nadu drugs control department on Saturday said the sample tested was “found adulterated, since it contains 48.6% diethylene glycol”. DEG, used in anti-freeze and brake fluids, is known to cause acute kidney failure and death when ingested.The state government immediately ordered a crackdown on Coldrif, manufactured by TN-based Sresan Pharmaceuticals, with the Food and Drugs Administration issuing urgent instructions to all drug inspectors to seize existing stocks, prevent further sales and draw samples from other batches for testing. The government also extended the prohibition to all other medicines made by the pharma company.MP CM Mohan Yadav, in an X post, said: “Death of children in Chhindwara caused by Coldrif syrup is extremely painful.” Late Saturday evening, he announced a compensation of Rs 4 lakh for the families of each of the deceased children. The state government would also bear the cost of treatment for the children still under care, Yadav said.The cough-syrup-linked deaths in MP and Rajasthan have sounded alarm bells across the country, with several states announcing probes and taking precautionary measures.The Central Drug Standards Control Organisation has initiated risk-based inspection of drug manufacturing units in six states — Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, MP and Maharashtra. The inspections are focused on companies manufacturing cough syrups, antipyretics & antibiotics, samples of which were picked up by the drug regulatory authorities from regions from where the fatalities were reported.The deaths in Chhindwara have taken place over a period of one month. All the kids were aged below five years, and renal failure was reportedly caused after taking cough syrups, including Coldrif, were prescribed by local doctors at private clinics. Five kids are recuperating at Government Medical College & Hospital in Nagpur.The deaths, first reported in late Aug, were largely concentrated in villages in Parasia tehsil of Chhindwara. The children initially showed symptoms of cold and mild fever, and were treated with cough syrups and routine medicines. However, their condition worsened soon with reduced urine output and acute kidney complications.Union health ministry sources said a multidisciplinary team comprising experts from the National Institute of Virology, Indian Council of Medical Research, National Environmental Engineering Research Institute, CDSCO and AIIMS-Nagpur, among others, were still analysing various samples and factors to assess the cause of deaths in and around Chhindwara.The ministry on Friday stated six samples tested by CDSCO and three by MP Food and Drugs Administration were found to be free of DEG and ethylene glycol. On Saturday, ministry sources clarified that the six “samples that have been tested so far by CDSCO were not of the two suspected cough syrups, including Coldrif, that have been under scanner”.The analysis of the samples of Coldrif and other suspected cough syrup by MP drug authorities is still underway.","The number of children dying of renal failure in MP’s Chhindwara district after consumption of cough syrup rose to 11, with two more fatalities reported on Saturday.

Nirav Modi case: India may give 'no arrest' pledge to get him extradited,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nirav-modi-case-india-may-give-no-arrest-pledge-to-get-him-extradited-cbi-ed-to-forego-new-cases/articleshow/124312839.cms,"File photo: Nirav Modi

NEW DELHI: ED and CBI, besides other agencies like the income tax , have together decided to make a joint submission before the Westminster court in London pledging that the agencies here in India will not file any fresh case against fugitive PNB scam accused Nirav Modi, and if at all it is necessitated anytime in future, it will be with the concurrence of UK court.The assurances include giving a blanket protection from any arrest once the fugitive is extradited to India, not to be booked in any other case, or interrogated by any other agency in any other case other than facing trial in pending cases of money laundering and corruption in which chargesheets have already been filed against him before special courts here.A few years ago the UK high court had turned down his appeal seeking to stop his extradition to India on the ground that his mental condition had deteriorated and that he might end his life.The court had then also accepted the assurances given by Modi govt about the conditions at Arthur Road jail — where the fugitive diamantaire would be lodged once he comes back, noting that India is a “friendly country”. The submission before the Westminster court will be made against an appeal filed by the incarcerated diamantaire seeking to reopen his extradition trial with prayers to stay his deportation cleared by the UK high court.The case has been scheduled for hearing on November 23.For the past several years, India has been fighting a tough legal battle in the UK courts seeking the extradition of the diamantaire, who was arrested in London in 2019 on an Indian extradition request, and has been behind bars for the last six years. In May this year, his bail application had been rejected for the eighth time, citing concerns of his disappearance and influencing witnesses.In July, his brother Nehal Modi, another accused in the PNB scam case, was arrested in the US by American authorities on charges of laundering the proceeds of crime. In multiple chargesheets filed in the PNB case during 2018 and 2019, ED had levelled serious charges against Nehal Modi, of destroying evidence and laundering proceeds of crime on behalf of his brother.“Nehal Modi was personally overseeing that all the accounts, records were destroyed and was influencing the employees/witnesses to conceal money trail and proceeds of crime,” sources said. The ED’s evidence against Nehal Modi includes his footprint in laundering huge stockpiles of gold, diamonds and cash consignments from Dubai and Hong Kong based entities of Nirav Modi."," ED and CBI, besides other agencies like the income tax, have together decided to make a joint submission before the Westminster court in London.

Ease of immigration to make Navi Mumbai airport a 'true hub',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ease-of-immigration-to-make-navi-mumbai-airport-a-true-hub/articleshow/124314029.cms,"NMIA will have an initial annual capacity to handle 2 crore passengers

NEW DELHI: Unshackling India's financial capital from its decades-old aviation infra crunch with the inauguration of the Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA), Modi government is all set to fulfil its vision of giving the country true hubs.From more slots for more aircraft including long range wide bodies, and a revamped immigration and security set up, the government is leaving no stone unturned to ensure Indians from across the country use the Navi Mumbai airport with an initial annual capacity to handle two crore passengers as a hub to fly an Indian carrier to rest of the world. The airport is scheduled to be inaugurated by PM Narendra Modi on October 8, with the first commercial flight in about a month.Soon, passengers travelling from at least seven cities in south and west India like Ahmedabad, Surat and Hyderabad to Mumbai's NMIA or Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) to take connecting international flights from there will be able to clear immigration at the first airport itself.This will enable them to fly into Mumbai, clear security and board their next flight - a seamless transit like that currently offered in Dubai, Doha, Abu Dhabi or Singapore Changi.Only difference: 'Atma Nirbharta' with a majority of them increasingly flying from an Indian hub on an Indian airline and not being ""feeders"" for foreign carriers via hubs abroad.For Delhi, the government is working on at least five cities in north and east India like Amritsar, Chandigarh, Jaipur, Lucknow and Varanasi, where people will be able to clear immigration on their way to Delhi for taking a connecting international flight. NCR is also going to get its second international airport before the end of this year when Noida International Airport (NIA) is expected to become operational.NIA, however, will have almost 95% domestic traffic, and the capital's IGIA still has spare capacity and scope for further growth.So the main focus in Delhi for seamless domestic (D)- international (I), I-D & I-I transfers is on IGIA. NIA will see D-D transfers, just like IGIA does.""NMIA will be a game-changer as CSMIA was for years operating beyond capacity. The travel demand of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region is immense. Navi Mumbai, which was only talked about as the site of a second airport since 1997, is now getting an airport and preparatory work has already started for MMR's third airport at Vadhawan. We see the dual airport system positioning Mumbai as the primary gateway for India travellers to the world while connecting the globe with Tier II & III cities here,"" said an official.""We are working to set up a true hub-and-spoke at NMIA, CSMIA and Delhi's IGIA with domestic networks of big and upcoming airlines, including Air India group, IndiGo and Akasa, flying in passengers who then take connecting flights on them to the rest of the world. Ditto on the way back,"" the official added..Officials say the Modi government has been working to strengthen the country's airline ecosystem as it foresaw the country's travel demand in coming years - which would have otherwise been continued to be met by foreign airlines via their hubs abroad.From 2014, India's guiding principle for granting flying rights (bilaterals) to foreign countries was keeping the interests of Indian airlines and passengers foremost. This allowed IndiGo, Air India and AI Express, after their successful divestment in 2022, and young Akasa to increase Indian carriers' share in international traffic to and from India to 46% in 2024 from the low 30s about a decade back.The simultaneous push on airport infrastructure is seeing Delhi NCR and MMR getting their second airports along with major expansion in other places like at Hyderabad and Bengaluru. With the right combination of strong airports and airlines, the focus is now on seamless transfers.""Supply chain constraints have meant IndiGo, AI Group and Akasa, among others, have not been able to get planes at the required pace from Boeing and Airbus. The government has eased the policy of leasing aircraft to help airlines overcome this challenge. IndiGo has been able to grow its international network due to that. AI has also started showing some aggression in the past month. The IndiGo long range Airbus A321s will start arriving from next Jan that will allow the airline to fly to Europe and the far east"" said an official.He said the government is the enabler and it is upto private players in the aviation ecosystem to make the most of India's massive potential.",Navi Mumbai International Airport set to be inaugurated by PM Narendra Modi on October 8.

India’s Growth And Resilience Unshaken Despite Global Tariff Pressures, Says Nirmala Sitharaman

AHMEDABAD: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman Saturday launched a nationwide campaign to return Rs 1.84 lakh crore of unclaimed financial assets lying with banks, RBI , insurance firms, mutual funds, provident fund accounts and other institutions to their rightful owners.The three-month programme also seeks to raise awareness. ""These unclaimed amounts are not government property but belong to individuals and families,"" Sitharaman said. ""Decades have passed when people voiced the need to return unclaimed monies from banks, RBI, or the Investor Education and Protection Fund (IEPF). This is their money.""She said such funds often arise due to missing documentation, forgotten policies or lack of awareness. ""It is like a ripe fruit hanging within reach but not falling into the hands of those to whom it belongs,"" she remarked.The campaign rests on three pillars - Awareness, Access and Action. Awareness means informing people about unclaimed money; Access through RBI's UDGAM portal; and Action, where officials act on even small clues to help claimants.","The three-month programme also seeks to raise awareness.

Poll Have you or someone you know ever fallen victim to online investment fraud? Yes No

Some transactions layered via ‘fake import of services’

New Delhi: Its promoters are based in Russia, technical support in Georgia, its India operations are handled from Dubai and the servers are in Barcelona.Illegal online trading platform OctaFX, being investigated by Enforcement Directorate for laundering thousands of crores of rupees from India to tax havens, has become part of a unique study by the agency into transcontinental operations that convert proceeds of crime into cryptocurrencies and use services of international payment gateways.A multi-agency probe has revealed that over the past few years OctaFX, which deals in forex, commodities and cryptocurrencies and is incorporated in Cyprus, made Rs 800 crore of alleged proceeds of crime from its India operations in just nine months.Some of the transactions were layered through ""fake import of services"" from Singapore to launder duped funds generated in India. In a particular case, ED has attached Rs 172 crore worth of assets in India and abroad, including a yacht, a villa in Spain, Rs 36 crore in banks, 39,000 cryptocurrency (USDT), land and Demat holdings of Rs 80 crore.OctaFX, being investigated by the ED's Mumbai zonal unit, is not the only illegal online platform indulging in investment frauds.The others under probe include Power Bank, being investigated by the Bengaluru zonal unit; 'Angel One', TM Traders and Vivan Li, being investigated by the Kolkata zonal unit; and Zara FX, being investigated by the Kochi unit.The ED's cases are based on several FIRs registered by police in different cities.""Angel One is a SEBI-registered, publicly listed, and fully compliant financial services entity, and is not under any investigation by the Enforcement Directorate or any other regulatory or enforcement agency,"" a company spokesperson said. The reference in the article is to an illegal website which is spoofing many legal entities and committing frauds.""Cyber frauds in the name of cryptocurrency included Birfa IT and related firms acting as brokers, converting huge amounts of money to and from crypto to help clients send money to China for under-invoiced imports, laundering the PoC (proceeds of crime) through cryptocurrency,"" the ED study revealed.The probe further found that in the Birfa case ""remittances of Rs 4,818 crore were sent to Hong Kong and Canadian entities controlled by scammers, under the pretext of paying for leasing servers, escrow services, etc"" on fake invoices.The ED document estimated that Indians have lost more than Rs 22,800 crore in around 36.4 lakh financial frauds reported in 2024 - a more than 206% jump in estimated losses from Rs 7,465 crore in 2023 and an over 50% jump in number of cases from 24.4 lakh in that year.Investigation against a similar cyber investment fraud found that the masterminds, operating from Laos, Hong Kong and Thailand, hired agents in India to set up shell entities with forged papers and issued fake IPO allotments, stock market investments and indulged in fake digital arrests. PoC was collected in shell companies, converted into cryptocurrencies and remitted overseas as payment for fake ""import of services"". While global payment gateways act as intermediaries, a part of the booty is laundered using hawala channels.","Illegal online trading platform OctaFX is being investigated by Enforcement Directorate for laundering thousands of crores of rupees from India to tax havens.

NEW DELHI: Those who violate traffic and other motor vehicle (MV) rules will soon be required to either accept and pay challans or contest them with supporting evidence within 45 days, says a draft notification proposing amendments to the MV Rules related to the issuance and payment of challans.As per the proposed changes notified by the road transport ministry, regional transport offices (RTOs) won’t process any applications related to the licence or vehicle registration of such offenders until the dues are cleared. Such vehicles and driving licence holders will also be flagged as “not to be transacted” on Vahan and Sarathi portal.Sources said these changes have been proposed to nudge violators to clear their dues.However, experts cautioned that, before implementing the changes, the govt must ensure that systems are in place for driving licence (DL) and registration certificate (RC) holders to raise objections against challans, and for their names to be promptly removed from the pending payment list once the dues are cleared.“The draft rules specify that anyone receiving a challan may contest it on the portal with supporting documentary evidence before an authority designated by the respective state govt.There is a need to clearly define the responsibilities of this authority, and there should be a penalty provision in place if the authority fails to remove a vehicle or individual from the defaulter list after dues have been cleared,” said a veteran from the transport industry.The ministry has proposed that police officers in uniform or any other official authorised by state govts be allowed to issue challan physically. They could also auto-generate challans. These challans must be delivered either in person within 15 days or electronically within three days.If a person does not contest a challan before the designated authority, it will be deemed accepted 45 days after issuance.According to the draft rules, if a challan is contested and the authority fails to resolve it within 30 days, or if it decides to quash the challan with recorded reasons, the penalty will no longer be enforceable.The petitioner may either accept the order and pay the fine within 30 days of it being uploaded on the portal or file an application before a court after depositing 50 per cent of the penalty amount. If the individual neither pays the fine nor contests the challan in court within 30 days of receiving the order, the challan will be deemed accepted.",Road transport ministry proposes changes to MV Rules related to the issuance and payment of challans.

Of 796 convicted foreigners in Bengal’s prisons, 204 are women

KOLKATA: West Bengal houses the highest number of foreign prisoners in the country. As many as 2,508, or 36%, of India’s 6,956 foreign prisoners are lodged in the state’s correctional homes, according to ‘Prison Statistics of India 2023’, released by the National Crime Records Bureau.As many as 89% of the foreigners detained in Bengal’s prisons, mostly Bangladeshis, have been prosecuted for illegally entering India.Foreigners make up 9% of Bengal’s total prison population of 25,774. Of the Bangladeshis lodged here, 778 are convicts and 1,440 undertrials. Myanmar takes second spot. Most undertrials are between 18 and 30 years of age.With more than half of the 4,906-km-long India-Bangladesh border falling in Bengal, the state has had to lodge a large percentage of foreign prisoners. While there were 796 foreign convicts in the state’s jails in 2023, there were 1,499 undertrials.In fact, NCRB data points to the fact that the country’s prisons have been housing more and more undertrials.According to a legal aid counsel, the rise in undertrial numbers has multiple reasons, including being unable to afford a counsel, absence of jurisdiction benches, and already overburdened trial courts.“Illegal Bangladeshi detainees are pushed back on the orders of the Foreigners Regional Registration Office.In Bengal, however, deportation remains abysmally low, despite our repeated pleas,” a senior state official said.Bengal’s prisons are overcrowded, with the occupancy rate being 120% in 2023. As many as 60 prisons, with a total capacity of 21,476, housed 25,774 inmates (nationals and foreigners). The only women’s jail in the state had an occupancy rate of 110.2%. Of the 796 foreign national convicts in Bengal’s prisons, 204 are women and 12 transgender persons.In the case of undertrials, there were 371 women and nine transgender persons out of 1,499 inmates.","As many as 2,508, or 36%, of India’s 6,956 foreign prisoners are lodged in the state.

NEW DELHI: Statistics ministry Saturday floated a discussion paper and invited views from experts, academicians, government bodies, states, financial institutions and other stakeholders on treatment of items distributed free of cost through PDS in the consumer price index compilation framework.The ministry is currently undertaking a revision of the CPI with the objective of updating item weights, revising the consumption basket and incorporating methodological improvements to strengthen the index. At present, the CPI is compiled every month on the basis of price data collection from 1,181 rural markets and 1,114 urban centres across the country.With the release of household consumption expenditure survey 2023-24, the ministry has also kicked off the exercise to revise the CPI base year from 2012 to 2024.Including items distributed through the PDS in the retail inflation basket is a crucial issue as it could have a bearing on the actual headline inflation outcome.In the existing CPI series, items that are distributed free of cost do not carry any expenditure share, since households incur zero out-of-pocket spending on them. This is consistent with international practice, according to the discussion paper which asked stakeholders to send in their comments by Oct 22. The paper states CPI serves a dual purpose in India.It is not only the principal indicator for monetary policy formulation by RBI , but also widely used as a proxy for tracking changes in cost of living and for indexation of wages, pensions and formulation of social welfare schemes.","The ministry is currently undertaking a revision of the CPI with the objective of updating item weights, revising the consumption basket and incorporating methodological improvements to strengthen the index.

About the recent student's protest over an alleged paper leak, Dhami spoke passionately about his government's commitment to protecting the future of Uttarakhand's youth.He stressed ""the state would not tolerate any attempt to play with the dreams of young people"". ""Some are saying we have bowed down before the youth or before those demanding a CBI probe. To all such people, I want to state clearly - for the sake of protecting the interests of the youth, I can not only bow my head - I can also sacrifice it.""In a dialogue with actor and author Ashutosh Rana , the CM also addressed the challenges of climate change and the steps being taken by govt to mitigate them.

NEW DELHI: Unique Identification Authority of India waived off all charges for mandatory biometric update of Aadhaar for children, an official statement said on Saturday. The fee waiver has kicked in effective Oct 1 and will be in force for a period of one year.""In a pro-people measure, UIDAI has waived off all charges for Mandatory Biometric Update, a move that is expected to benefit around six crore children,"" an official statement said.A child under the age of five enrols for Aadhaar by providing the photograph, name, date of birth, gender, address and birth certificate. The fingerprints and iris biometrics of a child are not captured for Aadhaar enrolment below the age of five because these are not mature at that age.""As per existing rules, fingerprints, iris and photo are mandatorily required to be updated in Aadhaar when a child reaches the age of five. This is called the first Mandatory Biometric Update (MBU). Similarly, a child is required to update biometrics once again upon reaching the age of 15, which is referred to as the second MBU. The first and second MBUs, if performed between 5-7 and 15-17 years of age, respectively, are thus free of cost. Thereafter, a prescribed fee of Rs 125 per MBU is charged. With this decision, MBU is now effectively free for all children in the age group of 5-17,"" the statement said.","The fee waiver has kicked in effective Oct 1 and will be in force for a period of one year.

NEW DELHI: After resisting for years the release of the answer key immediately after the preliminary examination, UPSC has given in to students' demands and told Supreme Court it will publish a provisional answer key after the exam ""to enhance transparency in its functioning"", and will entertain objections of candidates on discrepancies in the exam paper.The declaration was made in an affidavit filed by UPSC in Supreme Court on a batch of petitions by civil services aspirants from across the country.The petitioners, including Vidushi Pandey from Uttarakhand, had moved court seeking that the answer key be released immediately after the exam and before declaration of results, so that candidates can raise objections, and errors can be corrected on time.At present, the key is published after the final examination, almost a year after the preliminary exam, and virtually shuts the door on candidates seeking a remedy for any fault in the question paper.That as a consequence of comprehensive deliberation and considering the pious role assigned to the UPSupreme Court as a constitutional body, the Commission has arrived at a conscious and well-considered decision as under:a) Publishing the Provisional Answer key, after the Preliminary Examination is conducted;b) Representations/objections will be sought from the candidates who appeared in the examination.Each such representation/objection should be supported by three authoritative sources..., the affidavit said.The students have been fighting the legal battle for the last two years and the commission had at first strongly objected to their plea.It finally relented after senior advocate Jaideep Gupta, who was appointed by the Supreme Court as amicus curiae, told the court that greater transparency was needed in the examination process and suggested that a provisional answer key be published a day after the examination and examinees be allowed to file objections to the questions as well as the answers within a week.","The declaration was made in an affidavit filed by UPSC in Supreme Court on a batch of petitions by civil services aspirants from across the country.

Assam Police Slaps Murder Charge On Zubeen Garg’s Manager & Festival Organiser

NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Saturday announced that he will provide all future updates on the Zubeen Garg case and make all statements regarding the singer’s death only through Facebook Live to prevent “miscommunication. ”The Assamese cultural icon, 52-year-old Zubeen Garg, passed away on September 19 in Singapore, where he had travelled to participate in the North East India Festival. In response, the Assam government has formed a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to investigate his death and, separately, appointed a one-member judicial commission to examine the “facts and circumstances” surrounding his demise.“When I address the press, selected portions are often cut and taken. It may create unnecessary tension among the public,” Sarma told reporters. “If there is anything to be said regarding Garg’s death and investigation, I will say it only on Facebook Live. In the complex environment of the state, communication with the public should also be direct.”The CM assured that he would address all questions from journalists, but responses will be given only on the social media platform, allowing the public to see an “unedited” version.Garg died under mysterious circumstances while swimming in Singapore. The Assam Police CID, which is probing the case, has so far arrested his manager Siddharth Sharma, festival organiser Shyamkanu Mahanta, and two members of the singer’s band—Shekhar Jyoti Goswami and Amrit Prabha Mahanta.In a shocking allegation, Goswami claimed that Sharma and Shyamkanu Mahanta had “poisoned” Garg in Singapore.More than 60 FIRs have been filed across Assam against nearly 10 people, including the festival organiser, manager, and the two band members, and others.","Zubeen Garg died under mysterious circumstances while swimming in Singapore.

Defence Minister Rajnath Singh Reveals How India Thwarted Pakistan’s Attempt During Op Sindoor

Our fight against terror continues: Min

NEW DELHI: Warning Pakistan about its recent military infrastructure build-up near the sensitive Sir Creek region, defence minister Rajnath Singh Thursday said this shows its “true intentions”. Any misadventure by the neighbour would result in a response “so strong it will change both history and geography” of the area, he warned.“In 1965 (war), Indian Army showed courage by reaching Lahore. In 2025, Pakistan must remember that the road to Karachi also passes through the Creek,” Singh said after performing shastra (arms) puja at Bhuj military station in Gujarat.The marshlands of Sir Creek, a 96-km-long tidal estuary between Rann of Kutch and Pakistan’s Sindh, have been a bone of contention between the neighbours due to differing interpretations of the maritime boundary in the region. The long-standing dispute has implications for access to fishing rights and potential natural resources like oil and gas in the region and affects drawing of maritime boundaries and EEZs in Arabian Sea.Talking about the intense cross-border hostilities under Operation Sindoor from May 7 to 10, Rajnath said Pakistan made failed attempts to penetrate India’s defences along the LoCand International Border stretching from Leh to the Sir Creek region by launching multiple waves of drones and some missiles.The Indian response “exposed the weaknesses of Pakistan’s air defence”, Rajnath said. Despite its superior capability, India showed restraint because its military action was targeted against terrorism and its training hubs.“The objective of Operation Sindoor was not to escalate and start a war. I am happy that the Indian armed forces successfully achieved all the military objectives of Operation Sindoor.However, our fight against terrorismcontinues,” he said.","Rajnath Singh warns Pakistan about its recent military infrastructure build-up near the sensitive Sir Creek region.

UAE moon-sighting committee : Guardians of tradition





The UAE has officially confirmed that Ramadan 2026 will begin on Thursday, February 19, 2026, following the successful sighting of the new crescent moon. Astronomers and moon-sighting committees across the Emirates observed the moon, marking the start of the holy month for fasting, prayer, and reflection.As the Islamic year progresses, anticipation builds for the arrival of Ramadan 2026. Astronomers from the Emirates Astronomy Society have provided preliminary calculations, indicating that the holy month is expected to commence on Thursday, February 19, 2026. This projection is based on the expected birth of the new crescent moon on Tuesday, February 17, 2026, at 4:01 PM UAE time. However, the moon will set just one minute after sunset on that day, making its sighting impossible that evening. Consequently, the first day of Ramadan is anticipated to be Thursday, February 19, pending official confirmation by the UAE's moon-sighting committees.In Abu Dhabi, fasting hours are projected to begin at approximately 12 hours and 46 minutes at the start of Ramadan. These hours are expected to gradually increase to 13 hours and 25 minutes by the end of the month, aligning with the extension of daylight hours from 11 hours and 32 minutes to 12 hours and 12 minutes.Early in Ramadan, temperatures in Abu Dhabi are anticipated to range between 16°C and 28°C, influenced by lingering northern winter winds. By the end of the month, temperatures are expected to rise to between 19°C and 32°C, as spring weather patterns and westerly winds typically develop. Additionally, rainfall remains possible throughout the holy month, with precipitation levels potentially exceeding 15 millimeters, in line with seasonal climate averages for this time of year.The UAE Moon-Sighting Committee, officially known as the Shawwal Moon-Sighting Committee, is responsible for observing the crescent moon that marks the end of Ramadan and the beginning of Shawwal, leading to the celebration of Eid Al-Fitr. Chaired by His Excellency Sheikh Abdullah bin Bayyah, President of the UAE Council for Fatwa, the committee comprises leading local scholars, Islamic jurists, and expert astronomers. They convene annually to receive reports and testimonies regarding the moon's visual sighting, ensuring that the Islamic calendar aligns with lunar cycle-based observations.With Ramadan 2026 officially beginning on February 19, communities across the UAE are preparing for a month of spiritual reflection, generosity, and togetherness. From moon sightings to iftar gatherings, the holy month promises faith, joy, and cultural celebration for everyone observing Ramadan.","UAE confirms Ramadan 2026 begins February 19, with moon-sighting committees uniting faith, tradition, and astronomy for the holy month.

Elon Musk maintains lead over rivals as Larry Ellison briefly challenges his fortune

Tech entrepreneur Elon Musk has made history as the first person ever to surpass a net worth of $500 billion, highlighting his unrivaled influence in the global technology and business arena. This unprecedented milestone is driven largely by the soaring value of Tesla, his electric vehicle company, whose shares have surged due to strong sales, innovation, and investor confidence. Beyond Tesla, Musk’s wealth is bolstered by his space exploration venture SpaceX, which continues to secure contracts and expand its satellite operations, and his artificial intelligence startup xAI, which is gaining traction in the AI sector. Musk’s diversified portfolio, visionary leadership, and relentless focus on technological breakthroughs have positioned him as the world’s richest individual, reshaping industries along the way.On Wednesday afternoon, Forbes reported that Musk’s net worth briefly reached $500.1 billion before settling slightly above $499 billion later in the day. This exceptional wealth cements Musk’s position as the world’s richest person, significantly ahead of his closest competitors in the technology sector.The billionaire’s wealth is closely tied to his 12%+ stake in Tesla, which has experienced a remarkable surge in stock value over the past year. Tesla shares were up more than 3.3% at the end of trading on Wednesday and have risen over 20% year-to-date, reflecting growing investor confidence in Musk’s leadership and strategic vision. While Tesla remains the cornerstone of Musk’s fortune, his other ventures have contributed substantially to his net worth. The space exploration company SpaceX has seen increased valuation due to ongoing satellite and launch contracts, while his AI-focused startup, xAI, has gained attention in the tech world for cutting-edge developments.Recent months have also seen Musk redirecting his focus toward business rather than politics, a move that investors have welcomed. This strategic pivot is seen as a key factor behind Tesla’s stock gains and the corresponding growth of his personal wealth.According to Forbes’ billionaires index, Oracle founder Larry Ellison holds the second spot globally with a fortune of roughly $350.7 billion. Ellison briefly overtook Musk last month after Oracle shares jumped more than 40%, driven by positive forecasts for its cloud infrastructure, AI initiatives, and enterprise software growth, particularly in healthcare and financial services sectors.Despite occasional competition from rivals, Musk’s diversified portfolio, including Tesla, SpaceX, and other innovative ventures, and his leadership across multiple high-growth sectors have reinforced his long-term wealth trajectory, placing him comfortably ahead in the billionaire rankings and maintaining his influence in global business and technology markets with unparalleled reach and ambition.Musk’s influence at Tesla is now more pronounced than ever. In September 2025, Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm highlighted that Musk is “front and centre” in guiding the company’s strategy.Tesla’s board has also approved a potential pay package exceeding $1 trillion for Musk, contingent upon achieving highly ambitious targets over the next decade. These goals include boosting Tesla’s valuation eightfold, selling one million AI robots, delivering 12 million additional Tesla cars, and reaching several other business milestones.Musk’s recent $1 billion purchase of Tesla shares has been interpreted by investors as a strong vote of confidence in the company’s future prospects.Tesla has faced multiple challenges in recent years, including intensified competition from global electric vehicle makers such as China’s BYD. However, Musk continues to diversify Tesla’s portfolio, transitioning the company into AI and robotics, and expanding into digital currencies and other emerging technologies.Musk is also known for his outspoken views on social and political issues, including immigration and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. While he faced criticism earlier this year over his involvement with the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), he has consistently emphasized that his business pursuits are driven by societal and technological impact rather than personal profit.Musk’s relentless work ethic and focus on transformative projects have become hallmarks of his career. As Tesla investor Ross Gerber notes, “Elon only involves himself with things he believes are important for society or humanity,” a principle that underscores his broader mission beyond financial gain. By combining innovation across electric vehicles, space exploration, AI, and digital technologies, Musk has not only become the first half-trillionaire but has also reshaped the global technology landscape, inspiring entrepreneurs worldwide.","Elon Musk is the first person ever to surpass a net worth of $500 billion.

Microsoft frees up CEO Satya Nadella from some duties; read Nadella's email to employees company-wide,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-frees-up-ceo-satya-nadella-from-some-duties-read-nadellas-email-to-employees-company-wide/articleshow/124272687.cms,"Google Photos AI Update: Hands-Free Photo Editing

Here's CEO Satya Nadella's email to Microsoft employees on the restructuring:

We are in the midst of a tectonic AI platform shift, one that requires us to both manage and grow our at-scale commercial business today, while building the new frontier and executing flawlessly across both.

An image of Judson Althoff, chief executive officer of the commercial business at Microsoft.

History shows that general purpose technologies like AI drive step changes in productivity and GDP growth, and we have a unique opportunity to help our customers and the world realize this promise.

Our success depends on enabling commercial and public sector customers and partners to combine their human capital with new AI capabilities to change the frontier of how they operate. To accelerate this, we will increasingly need to bring together sales, marketing, operations, and engineering to drive growth and strengthen our position as the partner of choice for AI transformation.

With this context, I have asked Judson Althoff to take on an expanded role as CEO of our commercial business. Over the past nine years, Judson has led our global sales organization and was the architect behind designing and building Microsoft Customer and Partner Solutions (MCAPS) into what it is today: the “number one seed” in the industry and our company’s most important growth engine.

Takeshi Numoto and his marketing team will join this new organization, with Takeshi reporting directly to Judson as CMO, while also continuing to report directly to me on all-up business models, planning, consumer marketing, and corporate brand and communications.

Our operations organization will also move to report to Judson. By bringing operations into the commercial business, we can tighten the feedback loop between what customers need and how we deliver and support them. Carolina Dybeck Happe will continue to report to me, as she works on our overall company transformation and continues to closely partner with Judson.

Additionally, Judson will lead a new commercial leadership team that brings together leaders from engineering, sales, marketing, operations, and finance to drive our product strategy and governance, GTM readiness, and sales motions with shared accountability for the rigor and executional excellence our customers expect.

This will also allow our engineering leaders and me to be laser focused on our highest ambition technical work—across our datacenter buildout, systems architecture, AI science, and product innovation—to lead with intensity and pace in this generational platform shift. Each one of us needs to be at our very best in terms of rapidly learning new skills, adopting new ways to work, and staying close to the metal to drive innovation across the entire stack!!

This isn’t just evolution, it’s reinvention, for each of us professionally and for Microsoft.

Satya

In a country where royal families and oil tycoons dominate the wealth landscape, the richest man in Dubai is a tech billionaire. Meet Telegram CEO Pavel Durov who is the richest man in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) with a net worth of over $17 billion, according to Forbes Billionaires list. Durov is followed by Hussain Sajwani – chairman of Dubai-based luxury real estate developer Damac Properties, with a net worth of $10.2 billion. Globally, Pavel Durov ranks at number 118 in the Forbes global list. His rise reflects not only the global reach of his messaging app but also Dubai’s growing status as a hub for technology and innovation.Born in St. Petersburg in 1984, Pavel Durov is often referred to as “Mark Zuckerberg of Russia”. Durov first made his name by co-founding VKontakte, Russia’s largest social network. But after clashes with authorities, he sold his stake and left the country in 2014. That same year, he shifted focus to Telegram, which has since exploded into a global platform with over 1 billion monthly active users worldwide.Durov left Russia after refusing to cooperate with the secret service and provide encrypted data of his first social network's users.Telegram was banned in Russia from 2018 to 2021.In 2018 Pavel, with his brother Nikolai, raised $1.7 billion from investors to create TON, a blockchain system; it was shut down after the SEC banned it.Pavel Durov became a French citizen in 2021 but lives in Dubai. As per information available on Forbes billionaires website, he has five children that he shares with two ex-girlfriends. In the past, Durov has claimed to have donated sperm that led to him fathering 100 children.Durov relocated to Dubai, where Telegram is now headquartered. He later acquired UAE citizenship in February 2021.Relocating to Dubai gave Durov not only a strategic base for expansion but also UAE citizenship, placing him in a unique spot among the country’s wealthiest. Though Telegram app remains free to use, Durov introduced Telegram Premium in 2022, offering paid features to power users. This, combined with the platform’s high valuation, cemented his billionaire status.","Pavel Durov is the richest man in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) with a net worth of over $17 billion, according to Forbes Billionaires list.

Jensen Huang says high costs risk driving talent and investment overseas

'Brightest minds' essential to America's future argues Huang







Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has welcomed President Donald Trump's overhaul of the H-1B visa program but warned that the new $100,000 application fee may be prohibitively expensive, potentially driving tech investment and talent away from the United States.Speaking on the ""BG2 Pod"" podcast published Friday, Huang described the policy changes as ""a great start"" that addresses illegal immigration and visa system abuse. However, he cautioned that the steep fee ""probably sets the bar a little too high"" and could make foreign students uncomfortable about pursuing opportunities in America.The Taiwan-born executive, who has frequently cited his own experience as an embodiment of the American dream, emphasised that talent inflow serves as a key performance indicator for the country's future success. ""Smart people's desire to come to America and smart students' desire to stay, those are what I would call KPIs,"" Huang said on the podcast.Huang agreed with tech investor and podcaster Brad Gerstner that the substantial fee tilts the playing field toward large technology companies that can easily afford visa sponsorships, placing startups at a competitive disadvantage. He warned that the policy could prompt increased investment outside the US and affect global talent flows.The Nvidia chief also addressed concerns about Chinese researchers, separating America's competition with China as a nation from policies affecting Chinese individuals. ""We need to make sure that that slippery slope isn't crossed,"" he said.In a separate CNBC interview Monday, Huang reinforced his position on immigration reform. ""We want all the brightest minds to come to the United States. Remember immigration is the foundation of the American dream, and we represent the American dream,"" he told CNBC, expressing support for Trump's efforts to address the immigration system.Nvidia employed 1,519 H-1B visa holders out of 36,000 employees worldwide at the end of fiscal year 2025, making it one of the largest tech employers of H-1B workers in the United States, according to a Business Insider analysis from March. The White House clarified earlier this month that the $100,000 fee applies only to new applicants, not visa renewals.","Jensen Huang says high costs risk driving talent and investment overseas.

There are questions about where Zoho is developed and where the data is hosted and who hosts it. There is a lot of false information we want to correct.

1. All the products are developed in India. Our

global headquarters

is in Chennai and we pay taxes in India on our global income. As a global corporation headquartered in India, we have offices in over 80 countries and have a strong presence in the US which is a big market for us.

2. Indian customer data is hosted in India (Mumbai, Delhi and Chennai, soon Odissa). We have over 18 data centers globally and they host the respective country or regional data. We are committed to hosting each country data in their own jurisdiction.

3. All our services run on hardware we own and software frameworks we developed, on top of open source like

Linux

OS and Postgres database.

4. We do not host our products on AWS or Azure. Arattai, specifically, is not hosted on AWS or Azure or GCloud. We use some of those services for regional switching nodes to speed up traffic but data is not stored in them. We are adding many such ""points of presence"" (POPs) as we speak.

5. Our Zoho Developer account in the App Store and Play Store lists our US office address because the account was registered in the very early days of those stores by one of our employees in the US just to test them out. We never changed that.

We are proudly ""Made in India, Made for the World"" and we mean it.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has once again made an urgent appeal to Washington, arguing that allowing American technology companies to compete openly in China serves the best interests of both the countries. On the tech podcast BG2, a podcast hosted by tech investors Brad Gerstner and Bill Gurley, Huang emphasized that a competitive presence in China would enable the US to ""proliferate the technology around the world"" and ""maximise America’s economic success and geopolitical influence.""Huang also expressed hope that China would remain open to outside investment, noting Beijing's pledges to maintain an ""open market."" ""What’s in the best interest of China is for foreign companies to invest in China, compete in China and for them to also have vibrant competition themselves,"" he said.Huang highlighted the rapid advances and robust potential of China's chipmaking industry, cautioning that the country is ""nanoseconds behind"" the US. ""We’ve got to go compete,"" he asserted, pointing to China's deep talent pool, hustling work culture, and intense internal competition across its provinces.He described the environment as a ""vibrant, entrepreneurial, hi-tech, modern industry.""Nvidia's Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are the essential backbone for training and running artificial intelligence (AI) models, a factor that has propelled the company's market capitalization to record highs. However, this success has been complicated by escalating geopolitical tensions, which have severely disrupted sales in China, one of the world's largest markets.Earlier this year, the US temporarily blocked exports of the H20, a downgraded chip designed to comply with restrictions, before relenting after a 15% levy to the US government was agreed upon. In August, the White House announced that President Donald Trump and Huang had struck a deal under which Nvidia would receive export licenses in exchange for 15% of Chinese sales of the H20 going to the US government.In a related news, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang welcomed President Donald Trump's overhaul of the H-1B visa program but warned that the new $100,000 application fee may be prohibitively expensive, potentially driving tech investment and talent away from the United States.","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says U.S. companies should be able to compete openly in China.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Paramount to buy Free Press: Who is Bari Weiss?

Paramount Skydance is set to appoint Bari Weiss as editor in chief of CBS News in the coming days, providing the journalist with significant authority to overhaul the network as it acquires her independent news site, the Free Press, The Post has learned.Weiss, a 41-year-old former New York Times opinion writer who developed the Free Press into a prominent platform with a contrarian perspective, is expected to be named to the top position in a Monday announcement. However, negotiations remain uncertain, and the timeline may change, a source close to the matter stated.In a notable restructuring of CBS News’ longstanding management framework, Weiss will report directly to Paramount Skydance Chief Executive David Ellison as she assists in defining the editorial direction of the Tiffany Network’s third-largest news division, a source indicated.Weiss’s direct reporting line to Ellison means she will not answer to CBS News President Tom Cibrowski, who currently reports to George Cheeks, Chair of TV Media at Paramount Skydance.Insiders mentioned that Weiss’s hiring raises doubts about the potential return of former CBS President David Rhodes to the network, with one source describing their job prospects as an “either/or” scenario.Sources informed The Post that Weiss could serve as a strong counterpart to Cibrowski, a former “Good Morning America” executive who is viewed more as a production expert than a journalist.Others anticipate that it will soon be clear whether Weiss—who has become a leading voice against antisemitism and the “woke” elites in mainstream media—will challenge Cibrowski’s position.Weiss, 40, made her name as a sharp-tongued opinion columnist at The New York Times. Her pieces took aim at the MeToo movement, campus activism, and what she described as “illiberalism on the left.”In 2020, she quit in spectacular fashion, publishing a viral resignation letter accusing the paper of silencing ideological diversity.She then launched The Free Press in 2022, billing it as “fiercely independent.”The outlet quickly drew attention, and controversy, with stories that platformed conservative voices, a friendly sit-down with venture capitalist Peter Thiel, and essays that critics said downplayed the famine in Gaza.","Bari Weiss, a former New York Times opinion writer, is expected to be named to the top position in a Monday announcement.

A Social Outlet, to a Point





By Claire Cain Miller & Amy FanIn the last decade and a half, boys and young men ages 15-24 more than doubled their average time spent gaming, to about 10 hours a week, according to a major survey.Some teachers say gaming has disrupted focus in classrooms. Some economists have linked it to the decline in young men's work hours. Many readers told us it was a chief reason for the recent struggles of boys and young men, when we started our series on the subject in May.Yet video games also serve an important role in young people's lives. They've become a central way that young people socialise and provide them - especially boys - with a sense of belonging.The increase in time boys and young men spent playing games was the biggest of any activity measured by the American Time Use Survey, the large federal survey that each year asks a nationally representative sample of thousands of people what they did every minute of a day. (The category includes other types of games, like cards, but evidence suggests it's mostly video games.)The rise has coincided with technological changes that made games much more engrossing.Gaming went from an activity done at home on a console or computer to one also done on phones, anywhere and anytime.While parents have always worried about video games (especially whether playing certain games causes violence, a connection that has not been proved), a pressing concern now is about time spent playing. As it has increased, the fear is that video games have displaced other activities in boys' and young men's lives - including physical activity, in-person socialising, homework, jobs and sleep.""Boys would rather sit in front of Minecraft or Fortnite than play outside,"" said Susan Donohoe, an elementary schoolteacher in Portland, Maine. ""They are living a virtual life instead of real outside play and chores, which develop social skills and responsibility.""Yet researchers, and teens themselves, said these virtual worlds were also a place to make and build real friendships.Most teenagers play games with others, even if they're not physically with them, according to a nationwide survey of 1,500 teenagers published last year by the Digital Wellness Lab at Boston Children's Hospital.Boys - who researchers say tend to prefer doing activities while they're spending time with friends, more than having face-to-face conversations - are more likely than girls to game with others, the survey found. They are more likely to talk with friends while playing, like on FaceTime or Discord. And there is a social cost to abstaining.""It's an opportunity for boys to build up their community and feel connected to others,"" said Zhiying Yue, a scientist at the Digital Wellness Lab who is also a gamer.The hobby is nearly universal: 97% of teenage boys play online games, according to a Pew Research Center survey of teenagers last year, as do 73% of girls. But boys spend much more time doing it, the time use survey showed - 10 hours a week in 2024, compared with two for girls.Young people play video games to satisfy core developmental needs, said Yue: competence, by developing mastery; autonomy, by creating avatars and exploring worlds; and relatedness, by connecting with peers. These are things all adolescents crave, research shows. But boys and young men might seek them in the online world at a time when many say they're feeling adrift in the offline one.The risk is that new technology has made games much more immersive and addictive, said Zach Rausch, chief researcher at Tech and Society Lab at New York University.The major change, he said, came in the 2010s when many games became free to start playing, versus purchased upfront. This shifted companies' business models - the goal became to maximize the time people spent and incentivize small, in-game purchases.Online games update constantly, reward daily check-ins, sell limited-edition virtual goods and make real-time tweaks to keep players hooked. Many never end, making them hard to put down.By 2015, these changes had reshaped gaming - and the hours boys and young men spent playing had pulled ahead of the hours they spent on sports or hanging out with friends or family, the data shows.Males are more susceptible to video game addiction than females, who are more likely to become addicted to social media, research has shown. One reason is that males tend to be drawn to competition and risk-taking, said Dr. Marc Potenza, who studies addiction at the Yale School of Medicine. Brain scans show that when males play video games, they have stronger activation than females in the brain region involved in reward processing.While the Digital Wellness Lab survey found that lonelier adolescents gamed more, gaming didn't alleviate their loneliness - a pattern that was more pronounced for boys. This could be because those with weak social skills were more comfortable making friends online, but then got less practice interacting offline, researchers said.None of the researchers suggested parents ban video games. Games are important to how children bond today, they said, and there are also benefits for cognitive and problem-solving skills, mood and self-esteem. Instead, they recommended parents play alongside children, monitor the time they spend, and have conversations about risks.","Boys and young men ages 15-24 more than doubled their average time spent gaming, to about 10 hours a week.

But video games also serve an important role in young people's lives.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124315506,imgsize-40068,width-400,resizemode-4/how-video-games-are-shaping-boys-for-better-or-for-worse.jpg"
Taliban FM to visit India next week? Muttaqi gets travel exemption; first high-level trip since 2021 takeover,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/taliban-fm-to-visit-india-next-week-muttaqi-gets-travel-exemption-first-high-level-trip-since-2021-takeover/articleshow/124275380.cms,"Amir Khan Muttaqi (File photo)





Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi has been granted a temporary travel exemption to visit India next week. This marks the first high-level visit by a Taliban leader to New Delhi since the group took power in Afghanistan in 2021.According to officials, the UN Security Council sanctions committee has authorised Muttaqi to travel to New Delhi between October 9 and 16.The visit is expected to revive earlier plans that were delayed after sanctions restrictions prevented him from travelling, according to news agency Afghanistan International.Before arriving in India, Muttaqi will attend the seventh round of the “Moscow Format” talks in Russia on October 6 at the invitation of Russian officials. This will be the first time the Taliban participates as a member, rather than a guest in the multilateral forum.Describing the development as an “important step,” Muttaqi said he hoped such platforms would help strengthen trust and improve ties with neighbouring countries.The planned trip to India comes after months of speculation. In August, reports suggested that New Delhi was considering inviting Muttaqi, but government sources had clarified that India would approach the UN for a waiver only once the visit was finalised.Afghan media had then reported that the absence of approval had delayed the plan.India’s engagement with the Taliban has steadily increased in recent years, largely built around humanitarian assistance and developmental aid.External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has twice spoken with Muttaqi, including last week when he conveyed condolences over the recent earthquake in Afghanistan and announced India’s relief assistance.Earlier this year, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri also met Muttaqi in Dubai to discuss Afghanistan’s urgent developmental needs.India has consistently maintained that while it is aligned with the international community on the question of formal recognition of the Taliban regime, it will continue to provide humanitarian aid and support to the Afghan people.New Delhi has delivered large quantities of food, medicines and relief material and has over 500 development projects running across Afghanistan.Taliban officials have also called for stronger ties with India. Suhail Shaheen, head of the Taliban’s political office in Qatar, recently said high-level visits such as Muttaqi’s were essential to explore cooperation in trade and other areas, adding that the Taliban valued India’s assistance and historical friendship with the Afghan people.If the visit goes ahead, it will mark a landmark moment in India-Afghanistan relations, signalling New Delhi’s intention to cautiously deepen engagement with the Taliban regime while balancing global concerns about recognition and sanctions.",Amir Khan Muttaqi has been granted a temporary travel exemption to visit India next week.

Poll Do you believe the Taliban's suspension of internet services is justified? Yes, to prevent immorality No, it's an infringement on rights





The Taliban government in Afghanistan has ordered a nationwide suspension of internet and mobile phone service, following weeks of cutting fibre-optic internet connections in different provinces.According to internet watchdog NetBlocks, the country is experiencing a ""total internet blackout."" The group reported that the disruption appears to be the most extensive and coordinated shutdown of telecom services in Afghanistan since the Taliban regained control in 2021. The blackout has raised concerns about the return of earlier restrictions from the Taliban’s first rule, when they banned television, satellite dishes, and other forms of mass communication in what they described as a campaign against immorality.The government had already started reducing high-speed internet access in some provinces earlier this month. Officials said this was done to prevent ""vice,"" following orders from the Taliban’s supreme leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada.By Monday night, mobile phone signals and internet access steadily weakened across the country until overall connectivity dropped to less than one percent of normal activity, NetBlocks reported.It is the first time since the Taliban seized power in 2021, after years of insurgency, that communication services across the nation have been cut off. Since then, the group has enforced a strict version of Islamic law and imposed several restrictions.Residents expressed concern over the impact of the blackout on daily life and business. ""We are blind without phones and internet,"" Najibullah, a 42-year-old shopkeeper in Kabul, was quoted as saying by the news agency AFP. ""All our business relies on mobiles. The deliveries are with mobiles. It's like a holiday, everyone is at home. The market is totally frozen.""The Taliban have not issued an official explanation for the nationwide suspension. A government official, however, said that “eight to nine thousand telecommunications pillars” would be switched off and added that the blackout would remain in place “until further notice.”Just last year, in 2024, the Taliban had described Afghanistan’s fibre-optic project as a key priority. The 9,350-kilometre (5,800-mile) network, developed mostly during governments backed by the United States, was promoted as a way to connect the country with the outside world and support economic recovery.Earlier in September, Taliban representatives warned that they planned to cut off internet access nationwide “to prevent immoral activities.” They did not specify what was considered immoral under their order.Haji Zaid, the governor of Balkh province, said in a statement that ""an alternative system will be established within the country for essential needs."" He did not clarify what this system would include or how it would function.","The Taliban government in Afghanistan has ordered a nationwide suspension of internet and mobile phone service.

'Russia Will Bomb Germany If...': Berlin ERUPTS Against Merz; German Role In Ukraine, Israel Slammed

Closer cooperation between German army and police needed



First combat drones to be purchased



Learning from Ukraine



Rapid innovation and arms procurement







""We're really behind when it comes to defending against drones,"" defense minister Boris Pistorius recently admitted. Uncertainty is high after Russian drones invaded the airspace of several Nato countries in recent weeks. Suspected Russian drones have even been supposedly spotted over Germany. On the German television channel ZDF, Pistorius assured viewers that everything was being done ""to make up for this shortcoming.""Why is Germany so poorly equipped to defend itself against drones? One of the reasons for is has to do with the equipment needed to defend against drones. Shooting down incoming drones with fighter jets, as Poland recently did, is possible but also expensive and dangerous over populated areas.More suitable for this tast is Rheinmetall's Skyranger anti-aircraft tank, which can be deployed quickly and can also combat swarms of drones. The Bundeswehr, Germany's armed forces, has ordered 19 of these, which will not be delivered until 2027. However, military experts estimate that the demand is significantly higher.Its predecessor, the Gepard anti-aircraft tank, was decommissioned by the Bundeswehr years ago and later given to the Ukrainian armed forces.It has proved extremely effective in repelling Russian drone attacks.In addition to jammers, drones are also an effective means of defense against drones. The Bundeswehr has recently acquired German-made interceptor drones that capture enemy drones with nets.""We need to develop a multi-layered defense system that provides various options for shooting down or disabling drones — electronic countermeasures, kinetic devices, and then low-tech solutions such as net launchers,"" drone expert Ulrike Franke from the European Council on Foreign Relations told DW.Another challenge that Germany faces in defending against drones has to do with the distribution of responsibilities. At the moment, responsibility for countering drone threats is divided between the Bundeswehr and the police forces of Germany's 16 federal states.Defending against external attacks, such as those from fighter jets or large drones, falls within the remit of the military. The Bundeswehr is also authorised to take action if drones appear over military sites.In all other cases, drone defense is the responsibility of the police, who are responsible for internal security. If a drone is spying on a German airport or industrial facility, for example, the Bundeswehr cannot be called in.Although the police do have means of defending against drones, the challenge they face is getting them to the location where the drone has been spotted quickly enough. Security experts think that setting up a comprehensive ""drone defense shield"" over Germany is unrealistic.The separation of military and police duties has developed over time and is enshrined in the constitution. Given the current threats, the Bundeswehr will now be granted more powers to defend against drones. Interior minister Alexander Dobrindt plans to allow the military to assist the police, for example, by shooting down drones. The Air Security Act is to be amended accordingly. Dobrindt is also proposing the creation of a new drone defense center to coordinate the work of the federal and state governments.The Bundeswehr is not only stepping up its efforts in drone defense but also arming itself with drones. Recently, inspector general Carsten Breuer, the highest-ranking German soldier, announced that they would conduct their first live-fire exercises with armed drones at the end of the year.In March, Germany decided to procure so-called kamikaze drones for the troops. These are aircraft equipped with warheads that explode upon hitting their target. This is something quite new for Germany.It is no longer possible to wage war without drones, this became quickly apparent in Ukraine shortly after the Russian invasion in February 2022. Hundreds of thousands of drones are being deployed there. On the front lines, small kamikaze drones loaded with explosives are destroying expensive military equipment. The widespread use of reconnaissance drones means that no enemy movement goes unnoticed. This ""transparent battlefield"" has radically changed the nature of warfare.Drone expert Ulrike Franke recommends following Ukraine's example: ""It is absolutely clear that Nato countries need to look to Ukraine and learn from Ukraine when it comes to the ability to deploy, manufacture and modify drones quickly,"" she told DW.The Bundeswehr must now keep pace with these developments. Due to political concerns, it has long refrained from procuring attack drones. Critics feared that unmanned, remotely controlled aircraft could lower the threshold for the use of military force. There has also been much suspicion about the autonomous functions that many drones have.It was not until the war in Ukraine that this changed. In 2022, the German government decided to arm Bundeswehr drones for the first time. It ordered guided missiles for five Heron TP drones, aircraft-sized drones manufactured in Israel. Until then, the Bundeswehr had used only unarmed reconnaissance drones.It took until the beginning of this year for the decision to purchase kamikaze drones. According to the Ministry of Defense, this marked ""the beginning of a new era for the German Armed Forces."" The small disposable drones are known as ""loitering munitions."" This refers to the drone circling above the target before diving down and exploding.The categorisation of kamikaze drones as ""ammunition"" has very practical reasons: ammunition is fired and, therefore, consumed. A larger drone, on the other hand, is considered an unmanned aerial vehicle. With regard to flight safety and personnel certification, aircraft are subject to significantly higher technical requirements, thereby circumventing them.The German armed forces have already begun conducting training exercises on the deployment and defense against drones. This is now considered an ""everyman-skill"" that every soldier must master. A specific number of drones are being procured for this purpose and for immediate needs.What's more, the Bundeswehr is keen to avoid having to keep thousands of drones in storage. Technology in this field is advancing so rapidly that the usual approach to arms procurement, long lead times, long periods of use, would be counterproductive. So new contractual agreements are being made with manufacturers to ensure they can quickly deliver large quantities of the latest standard models when needed.German AI start-ups are the first choice now. Among them is Helsing, a Munich-based company founded in 2021, which has already produced several thousand combat drones for Ukraine.","Germany's armed forces have ordered 19 combat drones, which will not be delivered until 2027.

Babis pledges to run Czechia like a company



The billionaire rebel underdog?



Success in the 1990s



The move into politics



The Stork's Nest case



Babis in the headlines



Agent 'Bures'



The opportunistic populist







Andrej Babis has been dressing down for this election campaign trail, opting for jeans and sneakers instead of tailored suits and handmade shoes.He sometimes appears at these events wearing a wool sweater, sometimes in a black hoodie featuring his initials, AB, and sometimes in a T-shirt emblazoned with the words ""Czechia, everything for you"" or ""Czechia — against the green madness. ""Babis has rarely been seen on big stages during this election campaign, preferring to address small groups or speak from the platform of his election vehicle.He signs autographs, shakes hands, poses and smiles for selfies and seems to get chirpier the longer the events go on.This is 71-year-old Andrej Babis, billionaire, populist and controversial former prime minister of the Czech Republic.Andrej Babis has often been compared with US President Donald Trump , former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi or Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban. In reality, however, he stands for his very own, Czech brand of populism.Czechia goes to the polls on Friday and Saturday to elect a new parliament, and opinion polls suggest that Babis will be Czechia's next prime minister with his ANO party.When Babis appears on the campaign trail, he generally speaks out against ""the system"" and ""corrupt politicians,"" saying that the political establishment is incapable, bureaucratic and inefficient, that it disregards the people, divides up posts among its own, lies, cheats and wastes money.He claims that as a successful entrepreneur, he would do things very differently, running the state like a company. He also pledges to listen to the people, clean up the country in their name and help them to lead good and dignified lives.But although the billionaire likes to portray himself as the rebellious underdog in a hoodie and as the spokesperson of the poor and downtrodden, he has been part of the country's establishment all his life.Born in what is now Slovakia, he grew up in a family that belonged to the powerful elite of the communist dictatorship of Czechoslovakia.Due to his father's work as a trade representative, Babis lived for a time both in Switzerland and in France.After finishing high school in Geneva, he studied economics in Bratislava and later worked in foreign trade himself in a number of places, including Morocco.His mysterious rise to the ranks of the super-rich in the Czech Republic began in the ""wild 1990s,"" the period after the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe.In 1995, he assumed ownership of the agricultural and chemical holding Agrofert, which he had previously run as director.Babis tells a number of different versions of the story of how he came to own Agrofert, though many critics see them as vague and sometimes implausible. Today, Agrofert encompasses about 250 companies worldwide, and Babis is currently estimated to be worth about $3.5 billion (€3 billion).He says that it was what he calls the intolerable state of the country: corruption, bureaucracy and lack of reforms, that motivated him to enter politics.In 2011, he founded the ANO movement, which stands for Action of Dissatisfied Citizens and is, at the same time, the Czech word for ""yes.""Ever since, ANO's most important slogan has been ""Yes, things will get better!"" and its promise that Babis will set things to rights in the country.The voters gave him the opportunity to do just that: Babis was first finance minister from 2014 to 2017 and then prime minister from 2017 to 2021.But his tenure became mired in endless debates about his alleged involvement in cases of fraud and corruption. The Stork's Nest was one such case.The Stork's Nest is a wellness resort near Prague for which Babis was granted EU subsidies. It is alleged that he formally took a company out of the Agrofert Holding for a time to make it eligible for subsidies.Investigations into the Stork's Nest have been ongoing for almost a decade now. There have already been a number of rulings in the case, and in June of this year, a court in Prague ruled that the entire case had to be reopened.But the Stork's Nest is just one among many stories about Babis' alleged financial irregularities. For years, he has been in the headlines because of allegations of conflicts of interest, tax evasion, corruption, influencing the media and his past in the secret service of communist Czechoslovakia.He put his Agrofert Holding into trust funds in 2017. A court later determined that in doing so, he had obscured his role as owner. Babis was forced to sell his media companies in 2023 because of a law governing conflicts of interest.Like many populist leaders elsewhere, he has long been agitating against migrants and, more recently, against Ukrainian refugees. Nevertheless, it has been reported that his business empire employs numerous workers from non-EU countries such as Vietnam or Ukraine, sometimes under inhuman conditions.A court in Slovakia found that Babis once worked as an agent for the Czechoslovak secret service, the StB, under the code name ""Bures,"" though Babis denies this, and the issue has been the subject of numerous lawsuits between him and the Slovakian government.Whenever such a controversy pops up, Babis either says that he has ""done nothing illegal"" or that ""the system"" wants to take revenge and destroy him.While he was prime minister, there were mass protests in response to the scandals involving Babis and demonstrations for a ""clean country."" According to Babis, these were all propaganda activities organised by his enemies.Unlike his friend Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Babis does not view the European Union as the enemy.Although he is not the mouthpiece of Russian President Vladimir Putin , whenever there is talk of military support for Ukraine, he like to deflect the conversation, saying that he is ""a diplomat, not a soldier.""He has not so far had the political opportunity to reorganise Czechia, but it is not clear whether he actually wants to. It is possible that he is seeking the immunity that would come with being prime minister and would mean he no longer has to be questioned or appear in court.Babis is a smooth, some observers would even say opportunistic, version of a populist, a restless man with a huge ego.Babis once told the author of this article that he rarely sleeps, that he ""always has to be doing something"" and that he actually regrets having entered politics. At the same time, he said, the people in Czechia need him and he cannot let them down.","Andrej Babis is a 71-year-old billionaire, populist and controversial former prime minister of the Czech Republic.

China's K visa faces online backlash: Locals vent on Weibo; here's why,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/chinas-k-visa-faces-online-backlash-locals-vent-on-weibo-heres-why/articleshow/124309445.cms,"Representational photo

What is K Visa





China’s new K visa for foreign professionals is facing criticism on social media even before it comes into effect. Netizens have raised concerns over its timing, fairness, and potential impact on domestic employment.Originally scheduled to launch on October 1, the visa’s rollout has been delayed as Chinese embassies abroad remain closed until October 8 for National Day and Mid-Autumn Festival holidays.The K visa, described as China’s version of the H-1B, was announced in August but gained attention only after US president Donald Trump highlighted the USD 1,00,000 fee for H-1B visas, which mainly benefit Indian professionals.Critics pointed to China’s high unemployment, estimated at around 19 per cent over the past two years, and the pressure of 12 million new graduates entering the job market each year. Many questioned the policy favouring foreign STEM graduates over domestic talent.Concerns were also raised over the lack of employer sponsorship, which could increase the risk of fraud and low-quality applications.One Weibo user wrote: “It is already hard to verify domestic degrees. With the K visa, agencies may exploit the system to help foreigners get visas. How will each application be properly vetted?”Others asked why foreign bachelor’s degree holders are treated as ‘tech talent’ while young Chinese graduates struggle to find jobs and often pursue master’s degrees.Some suggested that a master’s degree should be the minimum requirement for K visa applicants.The newly introduced K visa, announced in August, aims to attract young international STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) graduates by offering entry, residency and work authorisation without requiring any prior work offer.According to Xinhua, the K visa will offer longer validity, multiple entries, and extended stay periods compared to China’s 12 existing visa types. Holders can engage in education, culture, science and technology exchanges, as well as entrepreneurial and business activities.","The K visa, described as China’s version of the H-1B, was announced in August.

IndiGo to resume its flight services







NEW DELHI: India and China are set to resume direct passenger flights by the end of October 2025, the ministry of external affairs said on Thursday, marking a significant step towards restoring normalcy in bilateral ties.In a press release, the MEA said both sides have been holding technical-level discussions since earlier this year on restarting direct air services and revising the Air Services Agreement.""Following these discussions, it has now been agreed that direct air services connecting designated points in India and China can resume by late October 2025, in keeping with the winter season schedule, subject to commercial decision of the designated carriers from the two countries and fulfilment of all operational criteria,"" the press release added.MEA added that the move is expected to expand people-to-people contact between the two neighbours.""This agreement of the civil aviation authorities will further facilitate people-to-people contact between India and China, contributing towards the gradual normalisation of bilateral exchanges,"" it said.IndiGo announced the resumption of its service to Mainland China following the recent diplomatic initiatives.It will resume its flight services connecting Kolkata to Guangzhou (CAN) with daily, non-stop flights starting October 26, according to the official statement.""Subject to regulatory approvals, IndiGo will also introduce direct flights between Delhi and Guangzhou shortly. IndiGo will use its Airbus A320neo aircraft to operate these flights that will re-establish avenues for cross-border trade and strategic business partnerships and promote tourism between the two nations,"" the airline said.IndiGo said its ""past experience and familiarity with local partners"" enabled it to resume these flights swiftly.IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers said: ""We are proud to be amongst the first to resume direct connectivity to China from two points in India. This will once again allow seamless movement of people, goods, and ideas, while also strengthening bilateral ties between the two of the world’s most populous countries and fast-growing economies… looking at introducing more direct flights into China."" The flights between Kolkata and Guangzhou will open for sale from Friday.The significant development came after an ice-breaker meeting between PM Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping in China during the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Summit.In 2019, India and China had 539 direct flights operated by airlines including Air India, IndiGo, China Southern and China Eastern. In March 2020, international flights were halted during Covid. The Galwan Valley clashes in June 2020 sent ties between the two countries into a deep chill. Since 2020, travelling between India and China means doing so through a third country, mostly in Southeast Asia.",India and China set to resume direct passenger flights by the end of October 2025.
