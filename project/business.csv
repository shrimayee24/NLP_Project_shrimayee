SC takes suo motu cognizance of ‘digital arrest’ scam; scammers forged top court's order to extort Rs 1 cr from woman,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-takes-suo-motu-cognizance-of-digital-arrest-scam-scammers-forged-top-courts-order-to-extort-rs-1-cr-from-woman/articleshow/124619525.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has taken suo motu cognisance of spiralling incidents of seamsters suing ‘digital arrest’ to extort money from citizens, especially senior citizens, after a septuagenarian woman from Ambala made a startling complaint - orders of SC were forged by scammers to con her into parting with over Rs 1 crore of her hard-earned money.The complainant, a 73-year-old woman from Ambala in Haryana, wrote a complaint to the CJI B R Gavai alleging that the seamsters produced a forged order of the SC purportedly passed by the previous CJI Sanjiv Khanna to put her on digital arrest and extort more than Rs 1 crore to set her free.The CJI and senior judges of the SC took serious note of the audacity of the seamsters to forge court orders, that too of the highest court of the land, to resort to ‘digital arrest’, a phenomenon unknown to law, in running extortion rackets across the country.The suo motu petition titled “In re: Victims of Digital Arrest Related to Forged Documents” will be taken up by a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi on Friday to decide whether the state police is competent enough to deal with the menace of ‘digital arrest’ scam or it required to be entrusted to central probe agencies equipped to make a country-wide probe.The unusual spike in incidents of digital arrest in recent years and the victims being vulnerable senior citizens, the SC would also consider whether judicial monitoring of the probe is required to give the investigations the desired swiftness and bring the culprits to book.The National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal (NCRP) had recorded 2,746 reported cases of digital arrest during Jan-Aug 2024, which nearly doubled to 4,439 cases in Jan-Aug 2025. The authorities have been issuing advertisements making citizens aware of the fraud and advising them to ignore threats of ‘digital arrest’ while reporting the incidents to police concerned.The govt agencies had blocked over 1,700 Skype IDs and 59,000 WhatsApp accounts used in these scams. Official statistics reveal that seamsters extorted nearly Rs 25 billion from citizens through ‘digital arrest’.",The Supreme Court has taken suo motu cognisance of spiralling incidents of seamsters suing ‘digital arrest’ to extort money from citizens.

Census pre-test from November 10 to November 30; self-enumeration during November 1-10,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/census-pre-test-from-november-10-to-november-30-self-enumeration-during-november-1-10/articleshow/124618465.cms,"NEW DELHI: The pre-test for houselisting phase of Census 2027 will be undertaken from Nov 10 to Nov 30, 2025 in selected sample areas spread across all states and Union territories, the Centre announced in a notification issued on Thursday.The pre-test — meant to test efficacy of the census questionnaire, proposed data collection methods including via the digital mode and other logistics – will allow an option of self-enumeration to the respondents between Nov 1 and Nov 7, 2025.The pre-test will cover only the houselisting and housing phase of the upcoming census exercise — which gets underway in April 1, 2026 — as per the notification issued by MHA in exercise of the powers conferred by Section 17A of the Census Act, 1948, read with rule 6D of the Census Rules, 1990.The home ministry had on June 16, 2025, notified its intent to conduct Census 2027 — the first ever to be done in the digital mode — with March 1, 2027, as the reference date. For the UT of Ladakh and snow-bound areas of J&K, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, the reference date would be advanced by six months, to 00.00 hours of the first day of October 2026.According to sources, Census 2027 - which is likely to put out final population data by 2027-end, setting the stage for delimitation and, based on it, implementation of women's quota in legislatures by the 2029 general election and, eventually, increase in strength of the Lok Sabha and state assemblies - is likely to replicate the schedule of past decennial exercises.It will be held in two phases - housing listing operations, likely between April 1, 2026, and Sept 2026, followed by population enumeration from Feb 9 to 28, 2027.Caste enumeration - a first since the 1931 Census - is likely to be done in the second phase of population enumeration. Unlike the 2011 exercises, no parallel updation of the Narional Population Register (NPR) is planned along with Census 2027.A four-day, intensive training of lead trainers for Census 2027 pre-test was conducted last week at the Registrar General of India and Census Commissioner’s office here on Friday. These lead trainers are now training the enumerators in the states/Union territories, following which the pre-test will be taken up in the field.A pre-test was last conducted for Census 2021 — before the exercise had to be put on hold on account of the Covid pandemic — in August-September 2019. However, since the Census methods have since been updated — with major improvements in applications to capture data and options of self-enumeration for both the houselisting and population enumeration phase — a fresh pre-test was deemed necessary. No fresh questionnaire has been notified yet for Census 2027; in all probability, there shall be no change in the data fields to be captured in the houselisting phase.Refresher training in the coming days will reorient the 34 lakh enumerators and supervisors and 1.3 lakh Census functionaries in the use of Census apps and the Census management and monitoring system.","The pre-test will cover only the houselisting and housing phase of the upcoming census exercise.

New Delhi: Supreme Court Thursday dismissed Telangana govt’s plea challenging a high court order staying implementation of 42% reservation for backward classes in local body polls.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta asked Telangana HC to decide the main matter on merits.“You may continue with your elections. The order shall not affect the HC in deciding the case on its own merits,” it said while dismissing the petition.On Oct 9, HC said increase in OBC quota appeared to violate the 50% limit set for reservations by SC and stayed the govt order. It had said the local body elections could proceed without implementing the proposed quota hike. Telangana had passed three govt orders — one on provision of 42% reservation to OBC in local bodies, and two consequential orders laying down on guidelines for fixation of such reservations in respect to elections to mandal praja parishads, zilla praja parishads and gram panchayats under Telangana Panchayat Raj Act, 2018.","Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta asked Telangana HC to decide the main matter on merits. “You may continue with your elections.

Gold and silver price prediction today:MCX Gold prices are currently trading around the ₹1,27,000 mark, reflecting strong bullish momentum. On the international front, COMEX gold is comfortably holding above the $4,000 level, further reinforcing the positive trend. This price behaviour indicates that gold is consistently forming higher lows, which is a classic sign of strength in technical analysis. The ability to protect previous support levels suggests that buyers are active at lower levels, absorbing selling pressure and preparing for potential upside moves.From a short-term trading perspective, gold prices have the potential to move towards the ₹1,30,000 level if the current momentum continues. Traders can consider accumulating positions near the ₹1,26,000 support zone, where buying interest has previously emerged. A strong support base is seen at ₹1,23,500, and any dip toward this level may offer a good risk-reward entry for bullish positions.Given the ongoing geopolitical tensions, inflationary concerns, and a weak global economic outlook, gold remains a preferred safe-haven asset.These factors are likely to keep demand strong and prices buoyant in the near term. As long as prices sustain above the key support levels, the outlook for gold remains optimistic with further upside potential.MCX Silver has shown significant strength and has outperformed MCX Gold in recent sessions, currently trading around ₹1,60,000 levels. This rally reflects robust bullish sentiment driven by a combination of industrial demand, investment interest, and a positive technical setup. Silver's strong price action suggests that market participants are confident in its upside potential, especially as it continues to make higher highs and higher lows, a clear sign of an ongoing uptrend.Compared to gold, silver tends to exhibit more volatility, which can offer attractive trading opportunities. Any corrective move or dip toward the ₹1,57,000 level can be seen as a buying opportunity, supported by strong demand and momentum. On the upside, prices have the potential to move toward ₹1,63,000 in the near term. Traders should maintain a stop-loss at ₹1,54,000 to manage risk effectively in case of unexpected price reversals.Silver's dual role as both a precious and industrial metal makes it a favored asset in times of economic uncertainty, as well as during periods of industrial recovery. With favorable fundamentals and technical strength, silver remains well-positioned for further gains, and buying on dips strategy could prove rewarding in the current market environment.","Both gold and silver prices are exhibiting strong bullish momentum.

Tata Motors demerger: What does it mean for investors & why did the share price drop 40%?

What does Tata Motors demerger mean for investors?

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Tata Motors demerger: Tata Motors shares dropped by 40% during early trading on Tuesday, with shares opening at Rs 399 on the Bombay Stock Exchange, compared to Monday's closing price of Rs 660.90. This is a notional decline in Tata Motors' share price post its demerger, according to an ET report.This adjustment occurred as the shares commenced trading ex-demerger value following the division of its commercial vehicles operations into a separate listed company. The reduction corresponds to the commercial vehicle division's removal from the parent company's valuation.October 14 is the record date for the company's division into Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd (TMPV) and Tata Motors Commercial Vehicles Ltd (TMLCV). Investors holding shares through October 13 will be allocated one TMLCV share for each Tata Motors share owned.The company will adopt the name Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd (TMPV), comprising passenger vehicles, electric vehicles and Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) units. TMLCV shares will be transferred to demat accounts within 30-45 days, followed by independent listing on the NSE and BSE after securing regulatory clearances.The existing F&O contracts due in October, November and December were concluded on Monday, with new contracts featuring adjusted lot sizes introduced from today.Financial experts anticipate the separation to enhance value assessment and business specialisation.SBI Securities indicates that the division ""enables clearer valuation of the company's distinct businesses."" They forecast TMPV, generating 87% of revenue from JLR, to be valued between Rs 285 and Rs 384 following the split, with growth prospects tied to JLR's operational improvements.For TMLCV, SBI Securities estimates a valuation range of Rs 320-470, highlighting its forthcoming €3.8 billion purchase of Iveco Group NV's commercial vehicle division, which should triple combined turnover and strengthen presence in electric and alternative fuel technologies. ""The integration of Iveco Group NV, most likely in FY27, will expose the company to the global CV cycle,"" they note, whilst cautioning about temporary margin reduction due to Iveco's lower EBIT performance.YES Securities views the separation as a ""value unlocking opportunity,"" observing that standalone passenger and commercial vehicle operations will enable targeted investment in specific automotive sectors.Brokerages say the demerger allows for a clearer valuation of Tata Motors’ separate businesses. “Overall, we expect value creation, as the commercial vehicles (CV) business is likely to trade at around 11 times EV/EBITDA on a FY27 basis, which translates to roughly Rs 300, in line with comparable peers,” said Pankaj Pandey of ICICI Securities, as quoted by Economic Times.“For the passenger vehicles (PV) segment, we estimate a fair value in the range of Rs 450 to 500. Since this is a vertical split, one of the most anticipated demergers, we believe there should be value creation, as the PV and CV businesses are poised for distinct growth trajectories,” Pandey added.According to Bonanza Research Analyst Khushi Mistry, the division ""will lead to sharper business focus for both entities."" TMLCV debuts as India's premier commercial vehicle manufacturer, commanding 37.1% market share and achieving 12.2% EBITDA margin in Q1FY26, despite reduced revenue. TMPV anticipates 8-10% growth in H2FY26, driven by product launches, strong SUV market position, and increasing EV and CNG adoption, representing 45% of its passenger vehicle earnings.Following a September cyberattack, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), the UK subsidiary of Tata Motors, initiated phased manufacturing operations on October 8. Khushi Mistry reported that wholesale volumes decreased by 24% while retail sales fell 17% in the September quarter, resulting in estimated weekly losses of £50 million. ""Full production is expected to resume post-Christmas due to the scale of restoration needed,"" she stated.YES Securities assessed that ""2QFY26 JLR dispatches (-24% YoY and QoQ) were impacted by production losses due to the cyberattack from early Sep'25. However, the retail-level impact was much lower. We expect volumes to gradually improve in 3Q and 4Q, which should support sentiment.""The share distribution plan allocates one TMLCV share per Tata Motors share owned. Details regarding acquisition costs for both entities will be provided subsequently to facilitate portfolio and tax calculations.Share price fluctuations are anticipated during the structural transition period. Industry analysts indicate that future performance will be determined by JLR's production recovery and TMLCV's operational success following the Iveco integration.The investment community remains focused on whether the corporate separation will boost Tata Motors' share performance or if value enhancement will require a longer timeline.","Tata Motors shares dropped by 40% during early trading on Tuesday, with shares opening at Rs 399 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.

"EPFO final settlement period extended: PF withdrawal now after 12 months, pension after 36 months; what it means for members",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/epfo-final-settlement-period-extended-pf-withdrawal-now-after-12-months-pension-after-36-months-what-it-means-for-members/articleshow/124554802.cms,"



EPFO subscribers take note! The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has extended the period for final settlement or full withdrawal of funds from provident fund and pension accounts for unemployed members. Under the revised rules, members can now withdraw their provident fund after 12 months of unemployment and their pension after 36 months, PTI reported.The change was approved by the apex decision-making body of the EPFO, the Central Board of Trustees, chaired by Labour Minister Mansukh Mandaviya, during a meeting held on Monday. Earlier, the scheme allowed full withdrawals from both accounts after just two months of continuous unemployment.A senior official explained PTI that the move aims to ensure social security for formal sector workers who typically exit the EPFO after two months of unemployment. “Most of these unemployed youth need to enrol again when they secure new jobs and lose chances of earning pension and other benefits, as an account becomes pensionable only after a combined service of 10 years or more,” the official said.The ministry said the revision will also allow partial withdrawals, enabling members to meet immediate financial needs without affecting their retirement savings or pension entitlements.Additionally, a provision has been introduced to maintain a minimum balance of 25 per cent of contributions in members’ accounts at all times.“This will enable members to enjoy the high interest rate currently offered by the EPFO, 8.25 per cent per annum, along with compounding benefits to build a sizeable retirement corpus,” the statement added.The rationalisation is intended to improve ease of access while ensuring members maintain a sufficient retirement fund over the long term.","EPFO has extended the period for final settlement or full withdrawal of funds from provident fund and pension accounts for unemployed members.

We do not subscribe to any unilateral sanctions.

""We would stress that there should be no double standards, especially when it comes to energy trade,"" he added.These remarks came after the UK government announced 90 new sanctions on Wednesday, targeting Russia’s oil exports and entities linked to its energy trade, including India’s Nayara Energy Limited.The move, coordinated between the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) and the Treasury, aims to ""strike at the heart"" of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s ""war chest"" in the conflict with Ukraine.""Today’s action demonstrates the government’s determination to cut off Putin's revenue streams – targeting Russian companies and their global enablers,"" the FCDO said in a statement.The sanctions cover four oil terminals in China, 44 oil tankers allegedly part of a ""shadow fleet"" transporting Russian crude, and Nayara Energy, which the UK claimed had imported 100 million barrels of Russian oil worth over $5 billion in 2024.London said the measures were meant to choke off energy revenues feeding Putin’s ""war chest"" amid the conflict in Ukraine.In response, Nayara Energy reaffirmed its compliance with Indian laws, stating that, ""Nayara Energy operates in full compliance with the laws and regulations of India. As an Indian company, we are deeply committed to supporting the nation’s energy security and fostering economic growth.""""We categorically state that this unilateral move by the European Union is founded on baseless assertions, representing an undue extension of authority that ignores both international law and the sovereignty of India,"" it added.The UK said its latest measures also directly target Russia's oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil, which together export about 3.1 million barrels per day.The FCDO noted that Rosneft alone accounts for nearly half of Russia’s oil production and around six per cent of global supply.","The UK government announced 90 new sanctions on Wednesday, targeting Russia’s oil exports and entities linked to its energy trade.

Chandrababu Naidu’s Bold Vision: Bullet Train To Connect Hyderabad, Amaravati, Chennai And Bengaluru

NEW DELHI: The Indian Railways will next focus on building ‘dedicated passenger corridors’ to cater to the growing passenger demand while increasing the capacity of existing tracks and developing Vande Bharat 4.0 trains, railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said on Wednesday.He said the dedicated passenger corridors will be designed for a speed of 350 kmph and an operational speed of 320 kmph and will be completely indigenous, providing huge opportunities to Indian players. The minister also warned suppliers and manufacturers against compromising on the quality of products and directed the Railway Board chairman to be ‘ruthless’ in blacklisting and blocking such companies from getting any work in the sector.Addressing industry players after he inaugurated the International Railway Equipment Exhibition, the minister said there are three major focus areas for railways: provide enough service for passengers and their comfort, ensure safety and make the national transporter ready for at least the next 25 years.On the target to have dedicated passenger corridors, Vaishnaw said, “We have to start constructing dedicated passenger corridors because we are 1.4 billion people; the transportation demand is humongous, and we have successful examples of economies of similar nature...Thesecorridors will be equipped with indigenously developed signalling systems and modern Operations Control Centres (OCCs).” He added that such corridors will be constructed across the country, and the target is to develop around 7,000 km of them in the next two decades.While highlighting the success of Vande Bharat trains, he urged the industry and railway engineers to reimagine the indigenous semi-high-speed train. The current Vande Bharat (3.0) is capable of accelerating from 0 to 100 kmph in 52 seconds. “The new version will focus on enhancing toilets, improving seats and elevating the overall workmanship of the coaches. Vande Bharat 4.0 (to be launched in the next 18 months) should be a train so advanced in quality and comfort that countries around the world aspire to adopt it,” the minister said.Vaishnaw urged manufacturers to focus on quality and safety, cautioning that “those who do not improve will lose out”. He directed the Railway Board chairman to carry out strict checks and blacklist those supplying poor quality materials.On the hydrogen-powered train, Vaishnaw said a 2,400-horsepower model has been developed entirely indigenously. “We will not import this technology. We will design it ourselves,” he said.",The Indian Railways will next focus on building ‘dedicated passenger corridors’ to cater to the growing passenger demand.

‘Modi loves Trump... he is a great leader’, says US president

WASHINGTON/NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump on Wednesday claimed he was assured by PM Narendra Modi on Wednesday that New Delhi was tapering its purchase of Russian oil to help stop the Russia-Ukraine war, but the external affairs ministry in Delhi denied knowledge of any such conversation.In Washington, in his customary freewheeling banter with pool reporters in the White House, Trump indicated that India’s pledge was conveyed through the new US ambassador to India, Sergio Gor, who was present in the Oval Office to brief the president about his meeting with Modi and India’s ministry of external affairs (MEA) earlier this week in New Delhi.“He’s assured me, there will be no oil purchase from Russia. I don’t know. Maybe that’s a breaking story. Can I say that? Would you say there will be no oil?” Trump said, waving towards Gor, and adding, “He’s not buying his oil from Russia.”New Delhi responded with a carefully worded statement that “it has been our consistent priority to safeguard the interests of the Indian consumer in a volatile energy scenario” and that it is broad-basing its energy sourcing. While there was no explicit denial by India of Trump’s claim, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal did say that he wasn’t aware of any conversation between Modi and Trump on Wednesday.India also didn’t confirm if there was any discussion on this issue when the leaders last spoke, on October 9.India also didn’t confirm if there was any discussion on this issue when the leaders last spoke, on October 9. The MEA statement didn’t directly refer to Trump’s remarks and the ministry said it was responding to media queries on comments on India’s energy sourcing. India’s response also underscored the fact that as far as the US is concerned, India has for years sought to expand its energy procurement. “This has steadily progressed in the last decade. The current government has shown interest in deepening energy cooperation with India. Discussions are ongoing,” said the official.Trump also conceded that India’s oil purchases may not stop immediately. “It started... It’s a little bit of a process, but the process is going to be over with soon,” he said, adding that he would also try and get China to stop buying Russian oil in an effort to stop the war. Once this oil revenue spigot for Moscow is turned off and war is over, Trump indicated India could go back to purchasing Russian oil.His hypothesis that Moscow would end the war if it does not get oil revenues from India and China is among the reasons holding up a trade deal between Washington and New Delhi. Both sides are said to be close to an agreement, with India indicating it is open to stepping up US energy purchases even as it draws down on buying Russian oil, although officials privately fumethe Trump’s performative public diplomacy tends to queer the pitch.Trump called Modi a “great man” and India “an incredible country”, and claimed that “he (Modi) loves Trump”. “Now, I don’t know if the word love… I don’t want you to take that any different... I don’t want to destroy his political career, but you have to understand… I’ve watched India for years... every single year you’d have a new leader. I mean, some would be in there for a few months, and this was year after year after year. And my friend has been there now for a long time, and he is, and he’s assured me, there will be no oil purchase from Russia,” the US president said.",US President Donald Trump claimed he was assured by PM Narendra Modi on Wednesday that New Delhi was tapering its purchase of Russian oil.

Fantastic Opportunity For Both: British Chambers of Commerce Hails UK-India Trade Deal as 'Win-Win'

The Indian Army on Wednesday signed the agreement with UK-based Thales group for the procurement of the Light Weight Modular Missile (LMM) system to significantly boost its air defence architecture and strengthen its air capabilities.Thales will manufacture the missiles and launchers at Belfast, Northern Ireland, before delivering them to the Indian Army.The contract follows days after India-UK defence initiatives unveiled during British Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s visit to India.In a joint statement, the Centre said the deal will further support India’s air defence capabilities and, in the spirit of ' Atmanirbhar Bharat', meet current and future requirements of the Indian Ministry of Defence while fostering long-term collaboration on complex weapons between the two countries.British defence secretary John Healey had said, ""The defence deals announced today show how our growing strategic partnership with India will boost UK business and jobs. I am hopeful this will pave the way for a deeper relationship between our two defence industries, particularly in the development of electric engines for naval ships and in air defence"" he added.The LMM is a lightweight, man-portable missile system that can be deployed in operational areas, including high-altitude regions, the Indian Army said.The missile operates on a laser beam riding guidance system, allowing precision strikes with minimal collateral damage. Equipped with a triple-effect warhead and proximity fuse, it is effective against aircraft, helicopters, UAVs, and UCAVs, including low-infrared signature targets, at ranges beyond 6 km in all-weather conditions.Weighing just 13 kg, the LMM is a supersonic weapon with speeds above Mach 1.5. Its advanced sighting system and high-explosive warhead give it a high single-shot kill probability. The system is optimised for air, land, and naval deployments, enabling rapid response against drones, light aircraft, and helicopters near borders or frontline positions, reported news agency ANI.","The Indian Army on Wednesday signed the agreement with UK-based Thales group for the procurement of the Light Weight Modular Missile (LMM) system.

Climate change becoming human rights imperative: Kovind,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/climate-change-becoming-human-rights-imperative-kovind/articleshow/124613695.cms,".

NEW DELHI: Former President Ram Nath Kovind Thursday cautioned that climate change is “no longer only an environmental concern but is becoming a human rights imperative”. The consequences of the challenges posed by climate change, manifesting in the form of floods, droughts and heatwaves, are borne largely by those who are least equipped to bear them, he said at a programme to mark the 32nd foundation day of the National Human Rights Commission ( NHRC ).During the event, which saw a day-long conference on human rights of prison inmates, Kovind also said the true test of a society’s values lies in how it treats those who are most vulnerable, including those who are in custody.NHRC chairperson Justice V Ramasubramanian said the commission has handled more than 23 lakh cases and about 2,900 cases of suo motu cognisance since its inception in 1993. NHRC has recommended monetary relief of more than Rs 263 crore in about more than 8,000 cases to victims of human rights violations.While noting that India has built a robust and comprehensive framework for the protection of human rights, Kovind asserted the need to recognise emerging and complex challenges. “We live in an age of unprecedented technological, environmental, and societal transformation. With the change in structure of employment in the modern economy, new forms of human rights concerns are emerging,” he said.He cited the example of workers in the informal sector, such as drivers, sanitation workers, construction labourers, and countless migrant workers and how too often, they endure unsafe working conditions, irregular incomes, and the absence of social protection. “Their human rights are frequently at risk,” he highlighted while emphasising that “economic progress must always walk hand in hand with human dignity”.","Former President Ram Nath Kovind cautioned that climate change is ‘no longer only an environmental concern but is becoming a human rights imperative’ The consequences of the challenges posed by climate change are borne largely by those who are least equipped to bear them, he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124613682,imgsize-7612,width-400,resizemode-4/screenshot-2025-10-17-002620.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Aggrieved by the preliminary inquiry into the June 12 AI 171 Ahmedabad crash which indirectly put the blame on the pilot, the father of the pilot in command of that flight and the Federation of Indian Pilots (FIP) have moved Supreme Court Their plea: The apex court order an independent investigation by a panel of aviation experts headed by a retired Supreme Court judge that takes into account all possible causes that could have led to the crash. Pushkaraj Sabharwal, 91, and FIP have contended that the preliminary investigation into the crash is ""profoundly flawed”. And they say the probe team is predominantly focusing on the pilots, who can no longer defend themselves.Pushkaraj Sabharwal had earlier written to aviation authorities also to express his anger at the preliminary report of Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) had “tarnished” his son Captain Sumeet Sabharwal's reputation. First leaks in the US media and then the AAIB report released within a month of the probe had, some directly & others indirectly, blamed a pilot for switching off the engines’ fuel supply.Government, on its part, says the investigation is fair and unbiased.The plea in Supreme Court says: “The current approach of the investigation has resulted in a failure to adequately examine, or rule out, other more plausible technical and procedural factors… The petitioners emphasise that factual misdirection through selective disclosure, especially against crew who cannot defend themselves, impedes root cause discovery and threatens future flight safety-calling for a neutral judicial lens. ”Questioning the composition of the five-member probe panel, it says: “The team is dominated by officers from DGCA, the State aviation authorities whose procedures, oversight, and possible lapses are directly implicated in the investigation. Moreover, the officers are placed under the control of the DG, AAIB, thereby creating a situation where the very entities responsible for regulating and overseeing civil aviation are effectively investigating themselves. ”The pilots’ union have long questioned the AAIB preliminary report which, they sources there say, “has rushed to give a clean chit to Boeing and blaming a dead pilot who can no longer defend himself.”Pushkaraj Sabharwal’s plea says as much. The AAIB investigation team appeared to ""predominantly focus on the deceased pilots ... while failing to examine or eliminate other more plausible technical and procedural causes.” He and FIP, which has about 5,000 members, have sought the current probe be stopped and a new panel of aviation experts headed by a retired Supreme Court judge conduct the investigation.","Pushkaraj Sabharwal, 91, and FIP have contended that the preliminary investigation into the crash is ""profoundly flawed"" They say the probe team is predominantly focusing on the pilots, who can no longer defend themselves.

Who Cut the Fuel? Inside the Mystery of the Air India 171 Cockpit Audio

MUMBAI: The investigation into the fatal crash of Air India Flight AI171 by the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) is facing legal challenges. A second case, this time a writ petition, has been filed before the Supreme Court of India demanding an independent, judicially monitored inquiry into the loss of the Boeing 787-8 (VT-ANB) on June 12, 2025, in Ahmedabad, which claimed 260 lives.The petition was filed by Pushkaraj Sabharwal, father of the deceased pilot Capt Sumeet Sabharwal, and the Federation of Indian Pilots. It directly challenges the preliminary report issued by the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), which attributed the crash to ""pilot action."" The petitioners allege the AAIB report is technically flawed, incomplete, and biased.A month ago, a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) was filed in the Supreme Court by the NGO Safety Matters Foundation seeking full disclosure of flight data, cockpit voice transcripts, and technical records related to the Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner accident. The PIL sought the appointment of independent professionals to monitor the investigation. It alleged that the preliminary report released by India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau a month after the accident was ""selective''.The incomplete disclosure of critical information, coupled with the premature attribution of pilot error while overlooking systemic faults is a violation of the articles of the Indian Constitution and international law governing accident investigations.The writ filed by the Capt's father alleges technical flaws and system failure played a role in the accident. The petition focuses on several critical technical inconsistencies that suggest a catastrophic system failure occurred before any crew input, such as premature RAT Deployment, for instance.The Ram Air Turbine (RAT) deployed during take-off, an event which typically indicates a major electrical or digital power failure, predating any alleged pilot error. Another point was about a possible total systems collapse. The simultaneous failure of all power and data systems, including the Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT), points to a single-point electrical collapse, it said.As for the fuel control switches, the AAIB report's finding of both fuel control switches moving from RUN to CUTOFF within one second is called physically improbable under take-off conditions, it said. The petition suggests these points to an automatic or corrupted FADEC (Full Authority Digital Engine Control) command.The writ petition stated that the AAIB allegedly failed to investigate a known risk in the Boeing 787's Common Core System (CCS)—the unified software that links all avionics, flight controls, FADEC, and electrical power. This is a crucial line of inquiry for potential cascading or common-mode failures. The petition cites anomalies in forensic evidence, including thermal damage to the Enhanced Flight Recorder without soot deposits. This suggests battery-induced combustion, not an external fuel fire, as the cause of damage.Beyond the technical arguments, the petitioners assert that the AAIB's investigation violates international standards for independence. Conflict of interest was brought to focus, the petition argued the investigation breaches the legal doctrine of nemo judex in causa sua (""no one should be a judge in their own cause""). It highlights that DGCA officials and representatives of the manufacturers (Boeing and GE) are part of the probe, compromising its objectivity. This arrangement allegedly violates ICAO Annex 13 principles for an independent investigation.Addressing the media reports in certain foreign publications that appeared before the preliminary report was made public, the petition accused the AAIB of unlawfully leaking confidential cockpit voice data (CVR) in violation of the Aircraft Investigation Rules, 2017 (Rule 17(5)).The selective leaks, the petition said, had fueled a prejudiced media narrative against the deceased flight crew. The petition ultimately prays for the constitution of a Judicially Monitored Committee, to be headed by a retired Supreme Court Judge, with the inclusion of independent aviation and systems experts. This move aims to ensure a transparent, technically sound, and unbiased inquiry consistent with global safety standards.","A writ petition has been filed before the Supreme Court of India demanding an independent inquiry.

Allies align as Bihar battle heats up



NEW DELHI: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar ’s Janata Dal (United) has released the names of all 101 candidates for the upcoming assembly elections. The two-part announcement, made over consecutive days, showcases a familiar balancing act: a strong tilt towards backward and extremely backward classes, cautious inclusion of upper castes, and a token nod to Muslim and women candidates.For Nitish, who has built his political legacy on the plank of social justice and development this list is as much a reflection of strategy as it is of survival. Over half the candidates come from OBC and EBC backgrounds: a signal that the chief minister is doubling down on his traditional base, even as questions persist over his party’s waning minority support and competition within the NDA.The JD(U)’s final list shows Nitish Kumar’s traditional reliance on the numerically strong OBC and EBC vote banks. Of the total 101 candidates, 37 are from OBC communities and 22 from EBCs. Among the OBCs, Kushwahas (13), Kurmis (12), and Yadavs (8) dominate, reflecting Nitish’s attempt to consolidate his core rural base.While the inclusion of four Muslim nominees offers some symbolic representation, the sharp reduction from 11 Muslim candidates in 2020 has stirred speculation over whether Nitish has deprioritised minority outreach amid his deepened alliance with the BJP.Almost all non-legislative council ministers in the Nitish Kumar government have been given another chance to contest, including Vijay Kumar Chaudhary, Bijendra Prasad Yadav, Zama Khan, Sheela Mandal, and Leshi Singh. Independent-turned-minister Sumit Kumar Singh, an old family associate of the chief minister, will again contest from Chakai.The JD(U) has also rewarded several political defectors and returnees. Vibha Devi, who recently crossed over from the RJD, has been fielded from Nawada, where she had previously won on an RJD ticket. Don-turned-politician Anant Singh, who left the JD(U) a decade ago before aligning with the RJD, is back in the fold and will contest from Mokama. Former MP Bulo Mandal, another ex-RJD face, has been brought back into active politics through Bhagalpur.Chetan Anand, the sitting MLA from Sheohar and son of JD(U) MP Lovely Anand, will contest from Nabinagar, while Sheohar has been handed to newcomer Shweta Gupta, a medical practitioner from Sitamarhi with prior BJP links. Former MPs Dulal Chandra Goswami, Mahabali Singh, and Chandraeshwar Chandravanshi, all of whom lost their Lok Sabha seats last year, have been offered a route to political rehabilitation through Assembly tickets.Despite Nitish Kumar’s vocal support for women’s reservation in legislatures, his party’s list shows only a modest commitment to gender inclusion. Thirteen women feature among the 101 candidates, including Komal Singh (Gaighat), Ashwamedh Devi (Samastipur), Ravina Kushwaha (Vibhutipur), and Kavita Kumari Saha (Madhepura). Two Muslim women have also been given tickets.The low representation comes despite the chief minister’s support for women’s empowerment through reservations in panchayats and local bodies.In the 2015 Bihar Assembly elections , the Janata Dal (United) fielded 10 women candidates out of a total of 101 seats contested. By 2020, the party increased its representation of women, nominating 22 female candidates out of 115 constituencies it contested.The JD(U)’s final list follows similar announcements by its NDA allies. The BJP has now released candidates for all 101 seats in its quota, fielding high-profile names like deputy chief ministers Samrat Choudhary and Vijay Kumar Sinha, singer Maithili Thakur from Alinagar, and former IPS officer Anand Mishra from Buxar.Union minister Chirag Paswan’s Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) has declared 14 of its 29 candidates.On Tuesday, Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) announced candidates for all six seats it will contest as part of the NDA alliance. Party founder and Union minister Jitan Ram Manjhi personally handed over the party symbol to each nominee. Sitting MLAs Anil Kumar (Tekari), Deepa Manjhi (Imamganj), Jyoti Devi (Barachatti), and Prafull Manjhi (Sikandra) have been renominated. Lalan Ram will contest from Kutumba, while Romit Kumar, nephew of Tekari MLA Anil Kumar, has been fielded from Atri.The Rashtriya Lok Morcha (RLM), led by Rajya Sabha MP Upendra Kushwaha, also announced six candidates. The list includes Tittu (Basopatti), Mayank Anand (Madhubani), Alok Kumar Singh (Dinara), Prashant Kumar Paswan (Ujiarpur), Meenakshi (Sasaram), and another Tittu (Paroo).The elections for the 243-member Bihar Assembly will take place in two phases on November 6 and 11, with counting scheduled for November 14. The ruling NDA, buoyed by its seat-sharing agreement, faces a renewed challenge from the RJD-led Mahagathbandhan — and a test of whether Nitish Kumar’s carefully calibrated social coalition of OBCs, EBCs, and women can still deliver.","Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar ’s Janata Dal (United) has released the names of all 101 candidates for the upcoming assembly elections. The two-part announcement showcases a familiar balancing act: a strong tilt towards backward and extremely backward classes, and cautious inclusion of upper castes.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124604369,imgsize-369828,width-400,resizemode-4/nitish-kumar.jpg"

"Bengaluru Business Corridor in two years to ease traffic, promises DK Shivakumar",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/bengaluru-business-corridor-in-two-years-to-ease-traffic-promises-dk-shivakumar/articleshow/124612757.cms,"



Bengaluru: Coming out with another ambitious deadline, deputy chief minister and Bengaluru development minister DK Shivakumar announced that the state govt would complete the 117km-long Bengaluru Business Corridor (BBC), previously known as Peripheral Ring Road, within the next two years. The corridor, connecting Tumakuru Road with Mysuru Road via Yelahanka and Electronics City, is expected to reduce the city's congestion.""The cabinet has taken an extremely important step towards realising BBC and reducing the congestion within the city by as much as 40% with the BBC project,"" Shivakumar said Thursday.The project will be executed in two phases: north and south corridors, with the northern section — from Tumakuru Road to Electronics City — being prioritised. BBC chairman LK Atheeq said the project will help decongest north and east Bengaluru.To facilitate land acquisition and ensure farmers are fairly compensated, Shivakumar unveiled a five-option plan. ""We have decided to provide the farmers with 5 clear options for compensation against their land acquisition for the project, which will cost the exchequer Rs 27,000 crore,"" he said. ""The previous govt had notified the project but had not taken it forward.Bengaluru needs an alternative to NICE Road. We have decided to take a loan of Rs 27,000 crore for the project through Hudco.""He added, ""The initial notification was for a road width of 100 meters, but we have decided to keep the road width of 65 meters, which is as wide as the Bengaluru-Mysuru highway. It will have a provision of 5 metres for a Metro project in the future. The remaining 35 metres of land will be given back to farmers as compensation.""Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) will oversee the construction.Farmers can select one of the five compensation options. Firstly, landowners with plots of 20 guntas or less will receive cash compensation at twice the guidance value within Greater Bengaluru Authority or municipal limits, and thrice in rural areas within 5km of the former BBMP limits. Secondly, farmers can opt for TDR (transferable development rights) at twice the guidance value. Thirdly, the Floor Area Ratio (FAR)/ Floor Space Index (FSI) of the acquired land can be used on residual plots alongside the corridor.Fourthly, residential plots in a nearby layout developed by BDA will be provided at 40% of developed land area. Finally, commercial land in the 35-metre corridor next to the Peripheral Ring Road (PRR) will be offered at 35% of developed land area.Shivakumar emphasised, ""At no cost will the land meant for the project be denotified. Bengaluru is choking and this new road will be one of the lifelines for the city traffic.""He added that if farmers reject all options, the govt would acquire the land and deposit compensation in court. The first phase of work will use 1,800 acres, with an additional 600 acres likely for ramps and cloverleafs. The corridor is expected to serve as a key lifeline for Bengaluru, easing traffic flow and creating a structured framework for future city expansion while providing multiple benefits to landowners.Govt to start TDR exchangeDeputy CM DK Shivakumar announced that the state govt has directed officials of the urban development department and the Greater Bengaluru Authority (GBA) to set up an exchange for transferable development rights (TDRs) to facilitate easier sale and purchase. ""This is a decision which has been taken outside the cabinet. Just like a power exchange where energy is purchased and sold, we are going to set up this TDR exchange,"" Shivakumar said.The move is aimed at streamlining land development processes in Bengaluru, providing a transparent platform for developers to acquire TDR and for farmers to monetise their land rights efficiently.","The 117km-long Bengaluru Business Corridor (BBC), previously known as Peripheral Ring Road, will be completed within the next two years. The corridor, connecting Tumakuru Road with Mysuru Road via Yelahanka and Electronics City, is expected to reduce the city's congestion.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124612756,imgsize-107834,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/bengaluru-business-corridor-in-two-years-to-ease-traffic-promises-dk-shivakumar.jpg"

chasing a target”

“The (second) question is with the release of 1% workforce, the headcount declined by 20,000 people or 3%. And what you had announced earlier was 2%. So should we expect a similar kind of head count reduction in the next quarter as well?”

“So almost -- see, the 20,000 head count is a factor of voluntary and involuntary attrition.

So you should see that. But as we announced, against the 2 percentage, we have midway, so we have done approximately 1 percentage of it. And like what Krithi just mentioned, we don't have a target.”

“We are not chasing a target. We'll continue to evaluate everyone after all the investment in learning and development that we've done…..” he continued.





Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) HR head Sudeep Kunnumal recently addressed concerns over potential layoffs at the IT giant.

Instead, the IT firm said it will evaluate “everyone”.During the earnings call, analyst Surendra Goyal from Citi asked:TCS HR head Sudeep Kunnumal replied to the question saying:Goyal further asked: “So just to clarify, there will be no involuntary attrition beyond the 1% number, is that understanding correct?”To this, Sudeep Kunnumal replied: “No, no, I didn't say that.See, we estimate it to be 2%. We are currently at 1%, and we will continue to evaluate people whom we can redeploy -- whom we are not redeploy, and those are the people that we will release.”During the earnings call, TCS HR chief also talked about the new H-1B visa rule announced by Trump administration last month. Kunnumal said “...on H1B, we have significantly localized our workforce in the U.S. approximately just about 500 associates have traveled to the U.S. on H1B. We believe our business model will be able to adapt quickly to any changes in immigration policy.” US announced an annual fee of $100,000 on H-1B visa applications from September 21 onwards.Separately, the company has also announced a wage hike for over 80 percentage of our workforce with the effect from September 1.","Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) HR head Sudeep Kunnumal recently addressed concerns over potential layoffs at the IT giant.

AI’s real value lies ahead







Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu is the next to join the ongoing ‘AI bubble’ debate. Vembu has issued a cautionary warning on the present surge in artificial intelligence investments. He described the market as a ‘financial bubble’ that could distort long-term innovation. In an interview with CNBC-TV18, Vembu said that while AI holds enormous promise, the present wave of huge valuations and funding practices are becoming a cause on concern. “This boom makes me very uncomfortable,” he said. “While AI as a technology has enormous promise, much of today’s investment is speculative.”Along with this, Vembu also pointed to a round-tripping which a financial manoeuvre where companies fund each other to inflate revenue. This practice as per Vembu is a troubling trend for the AI sector. He further warned that such practices could lead to unsustainable valuations which is smilier to the past bubbles in dotcom and e-commerce. “Some people argue the multi-trillion-dollar valuations will be justified by productivity gains. But why aren’t those gains visible already?” he asked.However, despite all these concerns, Vembu stressed on the fact that the underlying technology of AI remains valuable and will continue to deliver real benefits in the long term.He advocates for measured, purpose-driven investment rather than hype-fueled speculation. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos may have agreed with Sam Altman over ‘AI Bubble’ warningRecently, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos also pointed out that the current surge of investment in artificial intelligence (AI) constitutes an “industrial bubble” but stressed that the underlying technology is ""real"" and will bring immense societal benefits. Similar comments have been previously made by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman who reportedly said earlier this year that he believes AI could be in a bubble but it’s “the most important thing to happen in a very long time”.“This is a kind of industrial bubble,” the Amazon founder said while speaking at Italian Tech Week.“The second thing that happens is that people get very excited like they are today about artificial intelligence,” Bezos added, noting that when they happen, stock prices are “disconnected from the fundamentals” of a business. He said that during bubbles, every experiment or idea gets funded.“The good ideas and the bad ideas. And investors have a hard time in the middle of this excitement, distinguishing between the good ideas and the bad ideas. And that’s also probably happening today,” Bezos said.","Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has issued a cautionary warning on the present surge in artificial intelligence investments.

Price action in the leading stocks indicate short covering. Even now there are big shorts in the system and the strength in the market might keep the bears on the back foot, facilitating further short covering. Good results from the banking majors HDFC and ICICI can impart fundamental support to the market, and if RIL, which has been a laggard for some time now, also joins the rally, the market can sustain the momentum for some more time. Muhurat trading and the festival cheer can add to the bullish spirits.”“However, there are some lingering concerns which should not be lost sight of. China has been imposing restrictions on exports of rare earth metals and magnets in recent days.

CHANDIGARH: Rs 5 crore in cash, 1.5kg of gold jewellery, 22 luxury watches, keys to an Audi and a Mercedes, 40 litres of imported liquor, and multiple firearms — these were seized by the CBI during a high-stakes raid that led to the arrest of Ropar Range DIG Harcharan Singh Bhullar and a middleman on ThursdayDocuments linked to immovable properties and assets across Punjab were also confiscated, exposing a sprawling alleged bribery network.The arrests came after an iron merchant from Fatehgarh Sahib alleged that Bhullar, a 2009-batch IPS officer, demanded Rs 8 lakh to “settle” a case registered against him.The complainant claimed the DIG also sought monthly illegal gratification via a middleman while ensuring no coercive or adverse police action was taken against his business.CBI officials conducted simultaneous raids across Mohali and linked premises, meticulously laying a trap. “The private individual was caught red-handed while accepting Rs 8 lakh on behalf of the DIG,” the agency said, adding that a controlled call confirmed Bhullar’s acknowledgment of the payment and instructions for the complainant and middleman to meet him.The middleman was found with Rs 21 lakh in cash, and both were produced in court on Friday.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

In a major stride toward digital government transformation, the UAE’s Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MoHRE) has introduced an artificial intelligence-based system named 'Eye'. Announced at GITEX Global 2025, the system aims to revolutionise the way work permits are issued by reducing bureaucracy, improving efficiency, and eliminating human error through automated document verification.The ‘Eye’ system, developed and deployed by MoHRE, is designed to automate the entire work permit application process by integrating an advanced AI Agent. This agent is capable of verifying critical documents such as:By cross-checking and validating the authenticity and accuracy of each document, the system reduces the dependency on human staff to process applications. Manual intervention will only be required in exceptional cases, as the system is built to handle most scenarios autonomously.According to MoHRE, this marks a ""significant advancement in accelerating work permit issuance"" and aligns with the UAE’s broader efforts to digitise government operations and improve service delivery.Rashid Hassan Al Saadi, Acting Assistant Undersecretary for Labour Market Services at MoHRE, described the initiative as a milestone in digital innovation. He emphasised that:The introduction of ‘Eye’ supports the UAE government’s long-standing push to streamline administrative procedures.In June 2024, the UAE expanded an initiative to reduce the processing time for residency visas and work permits from 30 days to just 5 days.Additionally, the rollout of ‘Eye’ is part of a larger policy framework inspired by the Zero Government Bureaucracy programme, launched by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai. In this initiative, the government committed to eliminating 2,000 unnecessary procedures within a year. As of June this year, service delivery time had already been reduced by over 70% in its first phase.MoHRE currently issues 13 types of work permits, depending on the nature of the job and the sector of employment. These permits are legally required for any individual who wishes to work in the UAE. According to UAE Labour Law:To apply for a work permit, applicants must submit:The 'Eye' system aims to digitise and accelerate verification of all these documents, thereby speeding up approvals and reducing errors that might delay application processing.Beyond the launch of ‘Eye’, MoHRE showcased several other technology-driven initiatives at GITEX Global 2025, reflecting its ongoing commitment to digital transformation. These include:These initiatives are aligned with the UAE Government’s broader vision of leading globally in AI adoption and ensuring an efficient, agile, and business-friendly regulatory environment.","The UAE’s Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MoHRE) has introduced an artificial intelligence-based system named 'Eye' The system aims to revolutionise the way work permits are issued by reducing bureaucracy, improving efficiency, and eliminating human error through automated document verification.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124615039,imgsize-911785,width-400,resizemode-4/uae-work-permit-ai.jpg"

'Had detailed discussions with Taliban foreign minister'







NEW DELHI: The ministry of external affairs (MEA) on Thursday sharply criticised Pakistan over its recent hostilities with Afghanistan, while emphasising India’s commitment to Afghanistan’s sovereignty.Speaking on the tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, ""Three things are clear. One, Pakistan hosts terrorist organisations and sponsors terrorist activities. Two, it is an old practice of Pakistan to blame its neighbours for its own internal failures. Three, Pakistan is infuriated with Afghanistan exercising sovereignty over its own territories. India remains fully committed to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Afghanistan. ""In recent weeks, Pakistan has carried out targeted strikes in Kabul and other Taliban-controlled areas following a series of violent attacks by the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) on Pakistani territory.The Taliban government had then launched the offensive in ""retaliation for air strikes carried out by the Pakistani army on Kabul.""The Taliban had carried out operations along parts of the border with Pakistan, prompting Islamabad to promise a strong response.A 48-hour ceasefire between Afghanistan and Pakistan took hold late on Wednesday.The Pakistan Taliban operates independently of Afghanistan’s Taliban, but the two groups share ideological alignment. Pakistan has accused Kabul of giving shelter to TTP leaders and other groups, including the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and the ISIL affiliate in Khorasan Province (ISKP).TTP attacks have increased sharply since the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in August 2021, reflecting a growing trend in violence.During Afghan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi's recent visit to India, external affairs minister S Jaishankar had announced that India will upgrade its technical mission in Afghanistan to a full embassy.When asked about the development and India’s stand on recognising Afghanistan’s Taliban government, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, “We had detailed discussions with foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi covering humanitarian aid, development cooperation, and upgrading our embassy. We donated 20 ambulances and plan further work in Afghanistan’s health sector. The transition of our technical mission in Kabul into a full embassy will take place in the coming days.

Pakistan has secured a $1.2 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund . IMF on Tuesday said that it has reached a staff-level agreement with the South Asian country under its ongoing loan program, paving the way for Islamabad to access $1.2 billion pending approval from the Fund's Executive Board.According to the official statement issued by the IMF, Pakistan will receive $1 billion through the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and another $200 million under the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF), taking the total disbursements under both programs to about $3.3 billion.""The IMF team has reached a staff-level agreement with the Pakistani authorities on the second review of the 37-month Extended Arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and the first review of the 28-month arrangement under the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF).

Upon approval, Pakistan will have access to about US$1.0 billion (SDR 760 million) under the EFF and about US$200 million (SDR 154 million) under the RSF, bringing total disbursements under the two arrangements to about US$3.3 billion,"" the IMF said in an official statement.""Supported by the EFF, Pakistan's economic program is entrenching macroeconomic stability and rebuilding market confidence,"" the IMF said in its statement.The Fund noted that the country's recovery ""remains on track,"" citing contained inflation, stronger external buffers, and improving financial conditions reflected in narrowing sovereign spreads.IMF officials said the next tranche would be released once the board signs off on the review — a standard step in the Fund's lending framework, where loan disbursements follow successful periodic assessments.""The recovery remains on track, with the FY25 current account recording a surplus—the first in 14 years, the fiscal primary balance surpassing the program target, inflation remaining contained, external buffers strengthening, and financial conditions improving as sovereign spreads have narrowed significantly,"" it added.Pakistan has committed to maintaining a tight and data-dependent monetary policy and strengthening climate resilience — a key demand from the IMF after the floods devastated large parts of the country.""The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to the EFF- and RSF-supported programs, and to maintaining sound and prudent macroeconomic policies while advancing ongoing structural reforms,"" the statement added.Finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said earlier in the day that Pakistan was close to finalising the agreement after an IMF team concluded its review visit last week. ""The staff-level deal marks a major step forward,"" he told reporters, according to Reuters, signalling renewed investor confidence.Aurangzeb also revealed that Pakistan plans to return to international capital markets, starting with its first-ever green bond denominated in Chinese yuan before the end of 2025.

'Alarm bells'





LONDON: UK climate advisers warned the government for the first time on Wednesday to prepare for 2C of global warming by 2050, stressing current efforts to adapt to extreme weather are falling far short.Britain is among many countries experiencing record-breaking temperatures this year, with four heatwaves coming alongside below-average rainfall in some areas and prolonged periods of drought.The time spent under drought conditions could double if the 2C threshold is reached, according to the Climate Change Committee (CCC), an independent body tasked with advising the government.The committee said in a report earlier this year that the UK was woefully underprepared for the disastrous effects of climate change, highlighting major failings in areas from agriculture to transport.In a letter published on Wednesday, the CCC said ministers needed to prepare for ""weather extremes that will be experienced if global warming levels reach 2C above pre-industrial levels by 2050"".""We have to advise that the UK should be prepared for climate change beyond the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement,"" it added.Countries agreed in the 2015 Paris treaty to try to limit global warming to ""well below"" 2C, and aim for a 1.5C cap, which scientists warn is increasingly unattainable as human-driven climate change accelerates.Experts have long warned that warming beyond 2C could make large parts of the planet uninhabitable.The CCC said it was ""clear"" the UK was not yet adapted to the changes in climate it was currently experiencing ""let alone those that are expected over the coming decades"".It warned the chance of a heatwave occurring in a particular year would increase from 40 percent to 80 percent if global warming hit the 2C mark, and sea levels could rise by 15-25 cm.The committee said the government needed to prepare for more intense and frequent heatwaves, drought, flooding, storms and wildfire conditions.It recommended adapting infrastructure, including ensuring that new homes are resilient to higher temperatures.British homes are generally designed to withstand cooler temperatures and retain heat during the winter and air conditioning is rare in houses, public buildings and transport networks.Researchers have pointed out that older and vulnerable people living in poorly adapted homes face particular health risks from rising temperatures.""People in the UK are already experiencing the impacts of a changing climate, and we owe it to them to prepare,"" Julia King, chair of the CCC's adaptation committee said.""We need to see government treating adaptation with the same urgency that we have been able to treat cutting emissions.""The CCC urged the government to use 2050 as a ""horizon"" for making necessary changes, including ambitious projects like reservoir construction, with ministers warning the UK also faces growing water shortages in the next decade.Analysis of government data by the non-profit research organisation Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit earlier this month showed the UK had its second-worst harvest on record in 2025.The group warned that supporting farmers to adapt to extreme conditions should be an ""urgent priority for the government"".Greenpeace UK's chief scientist Douglas Parr said ""alarm bells should be ringing in government"" over the latest advisory.""Doubled chances of heatwaves, droughts and wildfires will make life in the UK look very different, very quickly,"" Parr said in a statement.On Wednesday, the United Nations called for urgent action to slash emissions as its meteorological arm revealed the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere went up last year by the biggest increase ever recorded.",UK climate advisers warn government to prepare for 2C of global warming by 2050.
