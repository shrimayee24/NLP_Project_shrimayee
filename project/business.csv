Cargo already entered into India may be allowed to exit the Indian territory as per the procedure,” the circular mentioned.The facility had enabled smoother trade for Bangladesh to Bhutan, Nepal, and Myanmar. But Indian exporters, particularly in the apparel sector, had long objected to the arrangement. Apparel Export Promotion Council (AEPC) Chairman Sudhir Sekhri earlier said that 20–30 Bangladeshi trucks arrived daily in Delhi, clogging cargo terminals and spiking freight costs.“Now we will have more air capacity for our cargo,” said FIEO Director General Ajay Sahai. “In the past, exporters have complained about lesser space due to the trans-shipment facility given to Bangladesh.”The move comes as global trade tensions rise, with the US recently announcing new tariffs on both India and Bangladesh.Trade experts say the cancellation will hit Bangladesh’s export logistics hard. “The previous mechanism had offered a streamlined route through India, cutting transit time and cost,” said Ajay Srivastava , founder of Global Trade Research Initiative, as quoted by PTI. “Now, without it, Bangladeshi exporters may face delays, higher costs, and uncertainty.”The geopolitical undertone became unavoidable after Yunus’ comments in Beijing, where he pitched Bangladesh as “the only guardian of the ocean” for Northeast India and invited China to deepen its economic presence in the region.“The eastern part of India, the Seven Sisters, are a landlocked region. They have no way to reach out to the ocean. This could be an extension of the Chinese economy,” Yunus had said.External affairs minister S Jaishankar swiftly countered the narrative, emphasizing India’s strategic maritime and regional links. “We have the longest coastline in the Bay of Bengal… Our North-Eastern region is emerging as a connectivity hub for BIMSTEC,” he said.With both countries being WTO members, Srivastava cautioned that India’s move may raise concerns over transit rights under WTO rules, especially for other landlocked nations like Nepal and Bhutan.","India has withdrawn a key trans-shipment facility granted to Bangladesh.

Tahawwur Rana extradited: What happens after 26/11 terror accused lands in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tahawwur-rana-extradited-what-happens-after-26/11-terror-accused-lands-in-india/articleshow/120135440.cms,"What happens when Rana lands in India?

What's next in the investigation?

Why Rana’s extradition matters

NEW DELHI: Tahawwur Hussain Rana , a key accused in the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks, will finally reach India after being extradited from the United States after over a decade of legal wrangling. A multi-agency Indian team is en route with Rana, and he is expected to land in India by Thursday afternoon, according to media reports citing sources.The 64-year-old Pakistani-origin Canadian businessman is accused of helping David Coleman Headley , his childhood friend and co-conspirator, carry out reconnaissance of targets later attacked by Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorists in 2008. The siege left 166 dead, including six American nationals, and lasted for nearly 60 hours.Upon arrival, Rana is likely to be produced before a special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court at Patiala House in Delhi. The NIA is expected to seek custodial interrogation to confront him with evidence, including emails, travel records, and testimonies already collected.Officials believe Rana’s questioning could provide fresh leads on the involvement of Pakistani state actors in the attack. He may be lodged in a high-security cell in Tihar Jail, where security has already been tightened.India had earlier given assurances to US authorities regarding Rana’s safety, legal rights, and prison conditions—a key factor in securing his extradition.According to the NIA charge sheet filed in 2011, Rana was deeply involved in planning the 26/11 attacks. He allegedly helped Headley gain a visa to India and established a Mumbai office — 'Immigrant Law Centre' — as a cover for reconnaissance activities.The agency claims Rana not only knew of Headley’s terror affiliations but actively supported him. He accompanied his wife on a tour through multiple Indian cities — Hapur, Delhi, Agra, Kochi, Ahmedabad, and Mumbai — between November 13 and 21, 2008. During these visits, Headley made dozens of calls to Rana.Their collaboration extended to planning attacks on Chabad Houses and the National Defence College. Rana was also in touch with Major Iqbal , a suspected ISI officer and co-conspirator.Rana was arrested by the FBI in Chicago in 2009 for supporting a failed LeT plot in Copenhagen. Though acquitted of direct charges in the 26/11 attacks by a US court, he was convicted for other terror-related offences and sentenced to 14 years in prison.India has pursued his extradition since, filing a request and securing a Red Notice from Interpol. Rana resisted the process through multiple legal appeals, including two emergency stay applications this year—one each to US Supreme Court Justices Elena Kagan and Chief Justice John Roberts. Both were denied.On April 7, the US Supreme Court formally rejected his last-ditch plea, stating simply: “Application denied by the Court.”The NIA hopes Rana’s interrogation will uncover more evidence about the network of conspirators, including LeT operatives Hafiz Saeed , Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, Sajid Mir, and HuJI leaders like Illyas Kashmiri—some of whom are linked to Pakistan’s ISI.The NIA special court has issued non-bailable warrants against absconding accused and submitted letters rogatory to Pakistan, though no response has been received so far.The NIA had earlier retrieved trial records from a Mumbai court, consolidating the multi-city legal effort into one court to streamline prosecution.Rana’s arrival in India marks a major breakthrough in the 26/11 case, which had seen only partial justice with the 2012 hanging of Ajmal Kasab, the lone surviving gunman from the attacks.With Rana in custody, India may be able to expose the operational and institutional links between Lashkar-e-Taiba and Pakistani military-intelligence networks—potentially reopening diplomatic and legal pressure on Islamabad.As India prepares for what could be one of the most consequential terror trials in its history, the return of Tahawwur Rana has reignited hope that long-delayed justice may finally be served.","Tahawwur Hussain Rana, a key accused in the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks, will finally reach India after being extradited from the United States.

Singapore SC quashes ex-CJI Dipak Misra's 'copy-pasted' arbitration award,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/singapore-sc-quashes-ex-cji-dipak-misras-copy-pasted-arbitration-award/articleshow/120141717.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a major embarrassment, Singapore Supreme Court has quashed an arbitral award against the special purpose vehicle ( SPV ) set up to manage dedicated freight corridors in India after finding that the tribunal headed by retired CJI Dipak Misra had copied 212 of 451 paragraphs from two earlier awards involving the same parties but on different issues.Though the tribunal also comprised MP HC ex-Chief Justice K K Lahoti and ex-CJ of J&K HC Gita Mittal, a Singapore SC bench led by Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon said since the other two were not part of the earlier awards, it couldn't be ascertained whether they were even aware of Misra's ""copy-paste"" job.The Singapore SC was firm that the copying compromised the integrity of the arbitration process and thus it did not adhere to the ""principles of natural justice"".The court said, ""The patently substantial material derived from parallel arbitrations were extraneous considerations that hadn't been raised to the parties' attention. The material formed such a pervasive part of the award that it simply could not be overlooked. It was plain that it was neither contemplated nor agreed to by the parties that the award could be prepared by such a process. We agree with the (Singapore HC) judge there had been a breach of the fair hearing rule.""By its award dated Nov 24, 2023, the Justice Misra-led tribunal had ruled in favour of the three firms which formed a consortium to bag the contract for Western Dedicated Freight Corridor in Aug 2015. A dispute arose because of the Indian govt's decision to raise labour wages, leading to the consortium demanding more money which was contested by the SPV, and the matter was referred to the Justice Misra-led arbitration tribunal.Upholding the Singapore HC's decision to set aside the award, Justices Menon and Steven Chong in a 40-page judgment analysed the award, found it plagued by copying and in breach of the principles of natural justice. The Justice Menon-led bench accepted the SPV's arguments and rejected those of the consortium.The SPV contended that Justice Misra, during the arbitration, had used extensive material derived from parallel arbitrations. ""It is also common ground that the award was not drafted afresh. Rather, the parallel awards were used as templates, with adjustments made to account for what were thought to be the specificities of the arbitration,"" the Singapore SC said.CJ Menon said the SPV had abandoned some of the submissions made in the parallel arbitrations and replaced these with new arguments unique to the arbitration at hand. ""These new arguments arose because of the slightly different factual matrix presented by the arbitration: for instance, the difference in the length of delay between the issuance of the notification and the consortium's claim allowed the SPV to make additional arguments on estoppel,"" he said.""Despite this, the parallel awards were used as templates in drafting the award to a very substantial degree. It is undisputed that at least 212 paragraphs from the parallel awards were retained in the 451-paragraph award. This has several implications,"" the Singapore SC said.""We also consider that the expectation of equality between the arbitrators was compromised. While, as we have noted, there is no evidence as to what transpired between the members of the tribunal, it is known that the two co-arbitrators in this case were not privy to the parallel arbitrations. They would thus have had no direct access to any material or knowledge derived from those proceedings, but which appeared to have significantly influenced the outcome of the present arbitration. The integrity of the arbitration was, therefore, further compromised as a result,"" it said.",Singapore Supreme Court has quashed an arbitral award against the special purpose vehicle ( SPV) The tribunal headed by retired CJI Dipak Misra had copied 212 of 451 paragraphs from two earlier awards involving the same parties but on different issues.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120142141,imgsize-543479,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"
AI puts flyer who urinated on co-passenger on no-fly list for 30 days,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/business-class-peegate-redux-this-time-on-air-indias-delhi-bangkok-flight/articleshow/120129817.cms,"NEW DELHI: A business class passenger seated in the second row of an Air India Airbus A320 flying from Delhi to Bangkok Wednesday urinated on a traveller in the front row, just before landing. Sources say this person “had alcohol like a significant number of travellers on flights between Delhi & the Thai capital but he was not sloshed.” Air India has barred him from flying for 30 days, pending action to be decided by an independent panel like the first peegate the airline had seen in Nov 2022.Cabin crew “provided assistance” to the victim — who declined to file a complaint against the passenger after he apologised profusely — and shifted the latter to another seat on the erstwhile Vistara A320 which has 2 by 2 seating in business. In Nov 2022, a business class passenger on AI’s New York-Delhi flight had urinated on an elderly lady in the same cabin class.“Air India confirms that an incident of unruly passenger behaviour was reported to the cabin crew operating flight AI-2336, from Delhi to Bangkok, on April 9, 2025. The crew followed all laid down procedures, and the matter has been reported to the authorities. In addition to warning the unruly passenger, our crew offered to assist an aggrieved passenger to take up a grievance with authorities in Bangkok, which was declined at the time,” an Air India spokesperson said.“The standing independent committee will be convened to assess the incident and determine the action, if any, to be taken against the unruly passenger. AI continues to follow the standard operating procedures as laid out by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) in such matters,” the spokesperson added.AI-2336 had taken off from Delhi just after 2 am on Wednesday and landed in Bangkok a little over four hours later. “He urinated just before landing. The aircraft lavs were functional. The crew had offered to help the victim in filing a complaint with the authorities on arrival in Bangkok but he declined to do so. Now the internal panel will decide on the course of action to be taken against the person who urinated,” said sources.In the earlier case on AI’s New York-Delhi flight, the person who had urinated was first barred from flying AI for 30 days and then put on the no-fly list for four months. Delhi Police had lodged a case against him under various sections and he was arrested in Bengaluru. He later lost his corporate job.Since that case, AI has become stricter with its liquor service policy. It put emphasis on cabin crew training to help them better recognise and manage possible cases of intoxication. Before the Nov 2022 peegate case, full service Indian carriers that fly abroad like Air India, and earlier erstwhile Jet Airways , were far more liberal in liquor service than their foreign counterparts, especially western carriers. That changed after the earlier urination case.On budget airlines, passengers have to buy liquor on board but even there crew was asked to generally limit sales to two drinks to avoid unruly behaviour by someone getting sloshed. LCC crew sell more only if a passenger seems to be in complete control of him/herself after two drinks on a case-to-case basis, said sources.Flights between India (especially north India Delhi) and Thailand are particularly known for rowdy behaviour by passengers “who are too happy to be going on vacation on the way out or too sad after the same is over and returning home,” say crew members. For instance, low cost AI Express had seen one of its highest ever liquor sales on its inaugural Surat-Bangkok last Dec.","A business class passenger seated in the second row of an Air India Airbus A320 flying from Delhi to Bangkok Wednesday urinated on a traveller in the front row, just before landing. Air India has barred him from flying for 30 days, pending action to be decided by an independent panel like the first peegate the airline had seen in Nov 2022. The victim declined to file a complaint against the passenger after he apologised profusely.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120129942,imgsize-457785,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"
"26/11 mastermind Tahawwur Rana contacted David Coleman Headley 231 times in India, says dossier",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/26/11-mastermind-tahawwur-rana-contacted-david-coleman-headley-231-times-in-india-says-dossier/articleshow/120140513.cms,"NEW DELHI: Tahawwur Rana , one of the main plotters of the 2008 Mumbai attack, had contacted David Coleman Headley 231 times during his visits to India ahead of the 26/11 carnage, according to the Indian dossier on him. Rana conducted eight reconnaissance missions and the highest number of calls (66) were made during the final visit before the attack.According to the dossier, Rana and Headley, along with other operatives, had mapped other targets in India, including National Defence College and India Gate in Delhi and multiple Jewish centres, as part of their plan to carry out spectacular terror attacks. NIA's chargesheet on him details Rana, along with Headley, Hafeez Saeed, Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, Ilyas Kashmiri, Sajid Mir and Major Iqbal, among others, had conspired to orchestrate the attack.Investigation by both India and US confirmed that Rana's Chicago-based immigration firm - First World Immigration Services, was used as a front to facilitate Headley's entry into India. Headley and Rana had a thorough discussion about their future plans when they met in US. ""As Rana was a deserter from the army, Headley offered to provide assistance through his connection with Major Iqbal,"" reads the dossier.Backed by the ISI, Rana exploited every option available to him to thwart his extradition. He even claimed pleas of double jeopardy/double prosecution which essentially holds that a person cannot be prosecuted twice for same offence. The US court, however, rejected his contention that American judiciary had already tried and acquitted him of charges for which India wanted him. The US court said the crimes he had been charged with in India were different from those for which he was prosecuted in the US. ""For example, India's forgery charges are based in part on conduct that was not charged in the US,"" the court observed.Rana's 2013 conviction in US, where he was sentenced to 14 years in prison, was for supporting Pakistani terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba and the terror plot in Denmark. Rana was convicted of conspiracy to provide material support to a plot from Oct 2008 to Oct 2009 to commit murder in Denmark, including a plan to behead employees of Morgenavisen Jyllands-Posten, a Danish newspaper which published a cartoon of the Prophet , and throw their heads on streets of Copenhagen, as well as providing material support, from late 2005 to Oct 2009, to Lashkar-e-Taiba.The website of the US Federal Bureau of Prisons has updated the status against Rana's name saying he wasn't in their custody as of Tuesday. Rana's register number (22829-424) read: ""Not in BOP custody as of 04/08/2025.""A team of officials drawn from Indian agencies in the US was tasked with facilitating his return. Sources said the chief investigating officer, DIG (NIA) Jaya Roy, signed off on the 'surrender warrant' Tuesday, following which swift arrangements were made to fly him to Delhi. The team left Wednesday around 6.30am, aiming to complete the journey with a brief pit stop. Incidentally, NIA is headed by Sadanand Date , a Maharashtra cadre IPS officer who, along with other colleagues, had rushed to Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus area on the fateful evening of Nov 26, 2008 after the terrorists struck at targets selected by, among others, Rana's partner in the massacre David Coleman Headley.Rana's interrogators, a source said, will aim to get him to divulge details about Pakistani state actors involved in the 26/11 plot, details of ISI network, as well as LeT's local collaborators and sources of funding. There also seems to be recognition that breaking down a hardened terrorist, especially one motivated by jihad, may not be easy.""He has already been probed extensively, and cracking him will not be an easy task. He would know where to mislead us and create smokescreens. This will be time-consuming,"" said a source in the know.Rana (64) is learned to have already got his contacts to engage his defence counsel. Due to security reasons, Rana may not be taken to court and his remand proceedings may be held in camera, sources said.","Tahawwur Rana, one of the main plotters of the 2008 Mumbai attack, had contacted David Coleman Headley 231 times during his visits to India ahead of the 26/11 carnage.

India ends transshipment facility for Bangladesh exports,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-ends-transshipment-facility-for-bangladesh-exports/articleshow/120141297.cms,"NEW DELHI: India has disallowed transshipment of cargo from Bangladesh to third countries, dealing a blow to Dhaka exporting apparel through air freighters, largely from Delhi.Global brands such as Zara, which use the route to meet their international need, will have to rework their sourcing strategy. The customs circular, issued Tuesday, said cargo that had already entered India would be allowed to be shipped out. Confirming the development that comes amid the strife in India-Bangladesh ties, MEA said the transshipment used to cause congestion at Indian airports and ports, but added the order won't hit Dhaka's exports to Nepal and Bhutan passing through India. tnnThe trans-shipment facility extended to Bangladesh had over a period of time resulted in significant congestion at our airports and ports. Logistical delays and higher costs were hindering our own exports and creating backlogs. The facility, therefore, has been withdrawn, w.e.f. April 8, 2025. To clarify, these measures do not impact Bangladesh exports to Nepal or Bhutan transiting through Indian territory,"" said MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal , adding India needs to create space for its own exports.While exporters had petitioned govt last year, the customs notification came days after Muhammad Yunus made controversial remarks in China, saying India's northeastern states, which share a nearly 1,600-km border with Bangladesh, were ""landlocked"", prompting a strong rebuttal from PM Modi ""India has always supported the Bangladesh cause. India allows one-way zero tariff access to Bangladesh goods (all except alcohol and cigarettes) to the vast Indian market for the last two decades. However, Bangladesh plans for creating a strategic base near Chicken's Neck area with China's help may have prompted this action. Bangladesh has invited Chinese investment to revitalise the air base at Lalmunirhat near India's Siliguri Corridor ,"" said trade research body GTRI.Industry here said this will help Indian players. ""It was the Apparel Export Promotion Council's long-standing demand for stopping trans-shipment of Bangladeshi cargo, meant for shipments to third countries, through Indian ports, which has now been accepted. This will help in rationalisation of freight rates resulting in less transportation cost to the Indian exporters besides decongesting the airports leading to the shorter transit time to ship the goods,"" said the industry body's secretary general Mithileshwar Thakur .The MEA spokesperson also reiterated India's demand that Bangladesh probe cases of violence against minorities, saying this was an issue that PM Modi strongly raised with chief advisor Muhammad Yunus during their recent meeting in Bangkok. ""This is not an issue that Bangladesh can wish away by calling it media exaggeration,"" said Jaiswal. Yunus had said in the meeting that most of the cases of atrocities committed on minorities were fake news.","Global brands such as Zara, which use the route to meet their international need, will have to rework their sourcing strategy.

NEW Delhi: The Supreme Court on Wednesday slammed the Centre regarding delays in establishing a cashless medical treatment scheme for motor accident victims. The court summoned the road transport ministry secretary for clarification.Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan noted non-compliance with their January 8 order.""The time granted has expired on March 15, 2025. This is a serious breach and violation of not only orders of this court but a violation of implementing a very beneficial legislation. We direct the secretary, ministry of road transport and highways to appear on video-conferencing and explain why the directions of this court were not complied with,"" stated the bench.The court observed that senior government officials respond seriously only upon being summoned.Additional solicitor general Vikramjeet Banerjee , representing the Centre, cited ""bottle necks"" as reasons.The court responded firmly, stating that the legislation was meant to benefit common people and prevent loss of lives due to lack of cashless treatment facilities. They warned of potential contempt proceedings.The secretary was instructed to appear on April 28 for explanation.The court additionally instructed the transport department secretary to provide written directives to district magistrates regarding uploading hidden hit-and-run claims on the GIC portal.On January 8, the court had directed the Centre to create a scheme for cashless treatment during the 'golden hour' as per law.Referencing Section 162(2) of the Motor Vehicles Act , 1988, the government was ordered to implement the scheme by March 14.The Act defines golden hour under Section 2 (12-A) as the crucial one-hour period post-trauma when medical intervention is most effective.The court emphasised that financial and procedural delays often result in fatalities.It highlighted the Centre's statutory obligation under Section 162 to create a cashless treatment scheme, supporting Article 21's right to life guarantee.The law requires insurance companies to provide treatment for accident victims during the golden hour according to the MV Act scheme.Despite being effective from April 1, 2022, the scheme remained unimplemented, necessitating court intervention.The Centre proposed a draft limiting treatment cost to Rs 1.5 lakh for seven days, which the petitioner's counsel deemed inadequate.The GIC was assigned to manage hit-and-run compensation claims and develop a streamlined portal. This portal would facilitate document uploads, notify states of deficiencies, and reduce processing delays. As of July 31, 2024, 921 hit-and-run compensation claims remained pending due to documentation issues. The court directed GIC to resolve these matters.GIC was instructed to complete portal development and report compliance by March 14, 2025.","Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan noted non-compliance with their January 8 order.

NEW DELHI: London high court on Tuesday rejected Indian government's application to appeal in the UK Supreme Court against the discharge of Sanjay Bhandari , a defence consultant wanted on charges of tax evasion and money laundering. The judgement also said that Bhandari, in Tihar jail , would be at risk ""of extortion and violence"" from ""other prisoners and prison officials""""In our judgment, having regard to all the evidence and information provided on this ground, including the fresh evidence, we conclude that in Tihar prison, the appellant (Bhandari) would be at real risk of extortion, accompanied by threatened or actual violence, from other prisoners and/or prison officials,"" their judgment said.The application, part of a two-step process to escalate the case to the UK Supreme Court, was the government's first move—but with this stage denied, officials have yet to confirm whether they will seek direct permission from the Supreme Court.""The court received an application from the government of India seeking certification of points of law of general importance and grant leave to appeal to the Supreme Court,"" justice Timothy Holroyde said.""Having considered the written submissions, the court is satisfied that no oral hearing is necessary, and no further submissions required. The two points on which leave to appeal was sought is refused. The reasons being that neither of the points of law of general importance were involved in the court's decision,"" he added.The court granted Bhandari's appeal against extradition on human rights grounds, ruling that sending him to India would breach Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) due to concerns over the conditions of his proposed custody in Tihar Jail. Additionally, the court upheld a second ground under Article 6 of the ECHR, citing concerns about the burden and standard of proof in Indian criminal trials, which could undermine his right to a fair trial.Bhandari was ordered to be discharged in February after a ruling by Westminster Magistrates' Court in November 2022, which led to the withdrawal of then UK home secretary Suella Braverman’s extradition order.He faced two separate extradition requests from India—one certified in June 2020 for alleged money laundering under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002, and another in June 2021 for allegedly attempting to evade tax under the Black Money Act, 2015.","London high court on Tuesday rejected Indian government's application to appeal in the UK Supreme Court against the discharge of Sanjay Bhandari.

Rana faces charges of murder, attempted murder, and waging war against India. He is accused of facilitating the attacks by providing support to key conspirator David Coleman Headley , including facilitating travel documents for Headley. Mumbai Police have said they have evidence against the Pakistan-born Canadian national in the form of documents on his travels and his stay in India.The prosecution's case is that Rana was the link between Pakistan's secret service agency, Inter-Service Intelligence (ISI), accused-turned-approver David Coleman Headley and Lashkar-e-Taiba.""Rana arrived in Delhi on Nov 11, 2008 and stayed in India for 11 days. For two days - Nov 20-21, he stayed at a hotel in Powai,"" a cop said. After two days, Rana left for Dubai a week before the 26/11 attacks.On the night of Nov 26, 2008, 10 Pakistani terrorists entered Mumbai by sea route and attacked CSMT, Hotel Taj Mahal Palace, Trident Hotel, Chabad House among other landmarks, killing 166 people including over a dozen foreigners. In a 60-hour operation, NSG and other security agencies killed nine terrorists while one was captured.The 26/11 trial began in 2009 with the prosecution of Ajmal Amir Kasab , the terrorist who was nabbed alive, and two others, Mumbai resident Faheem Ansari and Bihar resident Sabahuddin Ahmed . The latter two were acquitted. Subsequently, David Headley was pardoned by a trial court and accepted as a prosecution witness.

Though almost 78% of the waste is processed per day in the region, other parts of the country don’t have records of processing that much waste.The rules, notified by the environment ministry last week, will now make it mandatory for producers, recyclers, operators of waste storage facilities and collection points to register themselves on a dedicated portal for tracking and monitoring of their specific roles and time-bound targets in properly disposing of those waste.Every registered producer will have specific targets for recycling of waste under the EPR framework. Non-compliance of the rules will attract fines (environmental compensation) from state and central pollution control boards/committees as per guidelines, depending on the loss and damage the waste may cause to the local environment including air and water quality.“The payment of environmental compensation shall not absolve the producer from the extended producer responsibility, and the unfulfilled extended producer responsibility for a particular year shall be carried forward to the next year and so on for a period up to three years,” said the notification.The rules will, however, not apply for waste generated from defence projects, atomic energy sites and natural disasters.Under the rules, Bureau of Indian Standards and Indian Road Congress will also prepare code of practices for use of recycled materials in road construction.The money collected as environmental compensation under this rule will be kept by the CPCB in a separate account and will be utilised only for collection and recycling of uncollected, legacy and orphan waste.The urban development and municipal bodies of the states/UTs will be responsible for formulation and implementation of waste management policy, and issuance of directives for management of waste and utilisation of processed waste in its jurisdiction.These agencies will also be responsible for setting up of intermediate waste storage facilities and processing sites on local or regional or cluster basis within a year of notification of these rules.",India generates 150-500 million tonne of construction & demolition waste every year.

Poet claims Swift stole her work across multiple albums, but lawsuit stalls due to Taylor Swift’s elusive lifestyle



Taylor Swift accused of copying poetry after concert sparked suspicions



Pop superstar Taylor Swift is facing a legal storm yet again, this time in the form of a $30 million lawsuit accusing her of copyright infringement and the drama isn't just about the claims, but about how hard it’s been to even serve her the papers.Florida-based poet Teresa La Dart Marasco has filed a sweeping legal complaint against Taylor Swift and her production company, alleging that Swift unlawfully used her poetry in songs and visuals on four major albums: Lover, Folklore, Midnights , and The Tortured Poets Department. Marasco accuses the global music icon of a “pattern of intellectual property theft” and is seeking $30 million in damages.The case, however, is hitting a major roadblock: the plaintiff can’t find Swift to deliver the legal documents. Citing “extreme difficulties” due to Swift’s extensive security, secretive residences, and private travel, Marasco says the pop star is essentially untouchable. “It's impossible without court assistance,” she said in new court filings. The poet believes Swift’s celebrity status is shielding her from legal accountability.Marasco claims she first suspected her work was being used without permission after attending one of Swift’s Eras Tour shows in 2024. According to the lawsuit, “That is when she discovered the infringement and went back to her earlier albums to check other songs since there were so many found.”Despite the seriousness of the accusation, the court documents don’t outline exactly which lyrics or visuals allegedly mirror Marasco’s work, a fact Swift’s legal team has latched onto as they move to dismiss the case. So far, neither Swift nor her representatives have publicly responded to the revived legal action.Adding pressure to Marasco’s challenge is the legal clock. Copyright law gives plaintiffs a three-year window from the moment they become aware of a potential violation. Attorneys argue that many of the songs in question fall outside that statute, since they were released before 2021.Also Read: Did Taylor Swift really forgive Blake Lively after being dragged into the explosive $400M lawsuit scandal? This isn’t the first time Marasco has tried to sue Swift, a previous attempt in 2023 was tossed out for failure to serve. Now, she’s asking the court for more time and guidance before her claim disappears again, this time for good. Whether this case ever makes it to court remains uncertain — but the allegations are explosive, and Swift’s silence only fuels the controversy.","Florida-based poet Teresa La Dart Marasco has filed a sweeping legal complaint against Taylor Swift and her production company.

Odell Beckham leads race to be NFL’s first billionaire,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/odell-beckham-leads-race-to-be-nfls-first-billionaire/articleshow/120098596.cms,"Odell Beckham Jr. transcends traditional NFL success metrics, prioritizing influence and cultural impact over mere statistics. He's a cultural icon, bridging the gap between the league and younger generations through fashion, music, and art. Beckham's relevance attracts brands and coaches alike, proving that cultural capital is a valuable asset, redefining wealth in professional football.

Odell Beckham goes beyond NFL



NFL Star Odell Beckham Jr. Booed as Cops Kick Him Off Plane

Odell Beckham turning relevance into revenue



In an age where athletes are more than just players, Odell Beckham Jr. is the prototype of a new kind of NFL star, one who measures success not just by salary or stats, but by influence, impact, and identity. While discussions about billion-dollar athletes usually center on business empires and financial wins, OBJ is quietly redefining what it means to be “wealthy” in today’s game and it goes far beyond the bank account.Odell’s wealth isn’t just monetary, it’s cultural. Since exploding onto the scene in 2014, he’s been more than a wide receiver; he’s been a walking zeitgeist. From viral moments to headline-grabbing fashion choices, his presence commands attention in ways few NFL stars ever have. He doesn’t just play the game, he influences the narrative around it.Beckham’s name now surfaces in conversations once reserved for the likes of Tom Brady and Michael Jordan, proof that his brand power stretches far beyond the playbook.It’s no coincidence that brands across industries chase his name. Not because he’s always the top performer statistically, but because he brings something rarer: relevance. Beckham is tapped into music, fashion, art, and youth culture in a way that makes him more than a marketing asset, he’s a cultural translator between the league and the next generation.That’s what international sports agent Brittany Gilman was really pointing to when she named Beckham as a potential billionaire. Sure, he’s got endorsement deals and entrepreneurial plays like his “And Friends” brand. But the real asset? Connection. That’s the billion-dollar play Brittany Gilman was really calling—OBJ’s true wealth isn’t in contracts or commercials, it’s in his power to move culture. Beckham speaks to a wider world that the NFL itself is still trying to reach. That’s the kind of leverage money can’t always buy but can absolutely monetize.Even as his career winds down, OBJ’s influence is ramping up. Coaches like Sean McVay and Mike McDaniel recognize his value not just in yards gained, but in leadership and locker room presence. And fans across sports, fashion, and music still show up for him.Also Read: Braden Smith reveals his mental health battle- ""I didn’t care about my wife, or even my newborn son"" In a league built on stats, Beckham is proof that cultural capital may be the most valuable currency of all. Whether or not he crosses the billionaire finish line first, he’s already redefining what wealth looks like in professional football and he’s doing it his way.","Odell Beckham Jr. transcends traditional NFL success metrics, prioritizing influence and cultural impact over mere statistics.

Second Lady Usha Vance, who was the recently the eye of the storm over her Greenland visit, has spoken out about the attacks that she and Vice President JD Vance receive -- and a majority of it stems from her Indian roots. “Do I think it’s great when people talk about ‘ normalizing Indian hate ’ or something like that? Absolutely not. I think it’s terrible,"" Usha Vance said in an interview with The Free Press. ]But Usha said these racist attacks are nothing new. “I think it’s our relationship to this information”—the technology, the screens, the social media—“that is potentially new.”The recent India hate that surrounded JD ad Usha was DOGE staff Marko Elez, who made multiple racist posts in the past. ""Normalize Indian hate,"" one of his posts read. These racist posts got him fired from DOGE, but JD Vance was in favor of rehiring him, which drew ire from Indian-origin Democratic Rep Ro Khanna, who reminded JD Vance of that his kids share Indian origin because of Usha's roots.""Are you going to tell him (Marko Elez) to apologize for saying 'Normalize Indian hate' before this rehire? Just asking for the sake of both of our kids,"" Ro Khanna took a jibe at JD which rattled the Vice President as he did not like his kids to be brought to the debate.In the interview, Usha said she hadn't seen the back-and-forth between JD Vance and Ro Khanna in its entirety. “There is nothing that he cares more about than how his children grow up and how he relates to them and how we live together as a family. And he is very, very, very concerned, as we both are and I think maybe anyone in our position would be, about how this life impacts them,"" Usha said.The Second Lady said her highest priority right now is to be a normal person. “It’s a very strange life that we lead, where there are lots of people who have just imagined all sorts of narratives about us and what we think and what we do and why we do it and how much planning goes into it and all these sorts of things,"" she said.Usha said she has received a warm reception into the MAGA world though she is not from a wealthy background. “For what it’s worth, my reception into this world—and I’m not from a particularly wealthy background, not from a very fashion-oriented background personally or professionally—has been really positive,” she said. “People don’t seem to care all that much what I look like.”","Second Lady Usha Vance has spoken out about the racist attacks she and Vice President JD Vance receive.

Gold prices also gained, rising 3.22%, reflecting optimism across markets.Trump’s announcement, shared via a post on Truth Social, stating ""Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World’s Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately. At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable.""Conversely, and based on the fact that more than 75 Countries have called Representatives of the United States, including the Departments of Commerce, Treasury, and the USTR, to negotiate a solution to the subjects being discussed relative to Trade, Trade Barriers, Tariffs, Currency Manipulation, and Non Monetary Tariffs, and that these Countries have not, at my strong suggestion, retaliated in any way, shape, or form against the United States, I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10%, also effective immediately.

Mark Zuckerberg has become the latest tech billionaire to establish a presence in Washington DC, purchasing a $23 million mansion in the upscale Woodland Normanstone neighborhood, a report has said. The acquisition, confirmed by Facebook parent company Meta, represents the third-most expensive residential sale in the city's history.Politico reports that for weeks, the identity of the buyer remained shrouded in mystery as real estate agents were bound by non-disclosure agreements. Shortly after the cash transaction closed in early March, images of the 15,000-square-foot property became pixelated on Google Maps, the report added.Neighborhood residents noted increased activity at the previously vacant home, coinciding with reports that Zuckerberg’s private jet had landed at Dulles Airport.The publication says that a Meta spokesperson confirmed the purchase, explaining: “Mark and Priscilla have purchased a home in DC, which will allow Mark to spend more time there as Meta continues the work on policy issues related to American technology leadership.”The official explanation cites convenience and safety during increased Washington visits. Notably, Zuckerberg also has properties in Palo Alto, Lake Tahoe and Hawaii, among other places.Although tech titans have acquired Washington properties even before Trump's return to office, the pace has reportedly accelerated significantly in the past year.","The acquisition, confirmed by Facebook parent company Meta, represents the third-most expensive residential sale in the city's history.

Sir Jackie Stewart shares emotional truth about wife’s dementia



Sir Jackie Stewart , the legendary Formula 1 champion, is facing a challenge far greater than any race track could offer. At 85, the three-time world champion has dedicated his life to a different kind of victory—finding a cure for dementia. And it’s a deeply personal mission. His wife of over six decades, Lady Helen Stewart , was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia in 2014, a moment that would change their lives forever.Her diagnosis came after a car accident led to a detailed medical assessment, and since then, her condition has gradually worsened. Sir Jackie recently revealed a heartbreaking moment that encapsulates the gravity of her decline. “Just the other day it was time for dinner, she’s getting up and I’m sitting close by, and she says, ‘Where’s Jackie?’ That’s the first time that’s happened and that’s only a few weeks ago,” he shared with the BBC. “A bad feeling came over me.”For someone who has spent his entire life mastering control behind the wheel, dementia has proven to be an opponent that refuses to play by the rules. Lady Helen’s mental decline has taken her to what Sir Jackie describes as “a new world”—a place where familiar faces and routines no longer hold meaning. She can no longer walk unassisted and experiences symptoms of “sundowning,” a condition marked by late-day confusion and agitation. “She can hit somebody quite often, she uses language that she’s never ever said in her life and it comes like that,” Sir Jackie explained. “I say, ‘Darling, darling, don’t say that.’ She says, ‘Why?’ And she’ll give me a row for doing that. That’s usually after 17:00.”Despite having the financial means to provide Lady Helen with around-the-clock care and a fully accessible home in Switzerland, the racing legend is acutely aware that many others are not as fortunate. “I visit homes for people with dementia and I leave in tears because people are completely lost,” he said. These visits have left a lasting impression and intensified his commitment to making a difference.In 2016, he founded Race Against Dementia, a charity dedicated to funding innovative research that could detect and ultimately cure the disease. The initiative currently supports 18 researchers and is backing a pioneering trial at the University of Cambridge aimed at identifying dementia up to 20 years before symptoms appear. ""When you have a problem in Formula 1 [clicks his fingers] it's fixed... they’re also changing [technology] all the time, because they have enthusiasm and they see the results,"" Stewart said. ""I want this to happen just as much as I wanted to be world champion – it’s terribly important.”Sir Jackie Stewart’s story goes beyond racing trophies and podium finishes. It’s a deeply human tale of love, resilience, and the tireless pursuit of hope. And through his Race Against Dementia, he’s turning personal grief into global impact—one step closer to a cure that might one day rewrite the future for millions.Also Read: Fans go nostalgic as iconic Michael Schumacher and Charles Leclerc photo resurfaces as Ferrari star hits 150-race milestone at Japanese GP","Sir Jackie Stewart's wife, Lady Helen, was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia in 2014.

"'Paid Rs 7,000': As teacher falls ill, peon with MA degree in English evaluates Hindi answersheets at Madhya Pradesh college",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/paid-rs-7000-as-teacher-falls-ill-peon-with-ma-degree-in-english-evaluates-hindi-answersheets-at-madhya-pradesh-college/articleshow/120145398.cms,"Three staffers were sacked, and the principal and a professor suspended. The principal claimed he’s being targeted by local politicians and denied involvement.

BHOPAL: Twice 'outsourced', the evaluation of answersheets at a govt college in Madhya Pradesh's Narmadapuram district allegedly ended up in the hands of a peon, triggering a scandal that led to the sacking of three staffers and suspension of the principal and a professor.The peon, who has a master's degree in English, evaluated the Hindi paper.The multi-stage blunder happened at Shaheed Bhagat Singh PG College in Piparia a few months ago, and would have gone unnoticed but for a video that surfaced recently.The 20-second clip shows the peon checking answersheets with all seriousness, making tick marks and jotting down marks.After the video swirled around on social media, local MLA Thakur Das Nagwanshi raised the issue in assembly. The higher education department set up a probe committee, which submitted its report on April 3.The very next day, principal Rakesh Kumar Verma and the nodal officer for evaluation, professor Ramghulam Patel , were suspended. Verma alleges he is being targeted by local politicians.The committee found a shocking casualness in the approach to exam evaluation. In its report, the panel says that guest lecturer Khusboo Pagare, who teaches Hindi, has admitted in a written statement that she got the answersheets evaluated by someone else as she was unwell.According to the committee, she paid Rs 7,000 to 'book-lifter' at the college, Rakesh Kumar Mehar , to evaluate the answersheets. Mehar, in turn, handed it to peon Pannalal Patharia and gave him Rs 5,000, pocketing Rs 2,000, says the suspension order of the principal and nodal officer.Pagare, Mehar and Patharia were terminated on Wednesday.Suspended principal Rakesh Kumar Verma alleges that he is being targeted politically. ""In the past three months, I have been removed thrice. I was working on the post as per a stay order from the high court. I have again moved high court, and I am hopeful that the hearing will be held next week,"" Verma told TOI.""All this action against me is politically motivated by local representatives who wanted to have me removed as principal. The university directly appointed a nodal officer for evaluation of answersheets. Professor Ramghulam Patel was appointed in August last year. I had no role in evaluation, nor did I receive any payment from the university for it. When there was an independently appointed officer and I had no role in evaluation, why should I be suspended? Whatever happened in the evaluation may be wrong; it is a matter of investigation, but I have no role in it,"" he said.","Three staffers were sacked, and the principal and a professor suspended.

NEW DELHI: Intriguing developments keep unfolding in Indian boxing’s administrative sphere. The Ajay Singh-led Boxing Federation of India (BFI), which put the elections for the new executive committee on hold, has been helped by the global governing body – World Boxing (WB) – to maintain its control over the sports body’s affairs and keep the electoral proceedings in abeyance for extended duration.While BFI and the rival faction vying for control of the federation engage in legal battles across various courts in India, World Boxing announced the establishment of an interim committee “to provide administrative continuity and safeguard the rights and interests of Indian boxers until elections are held and a new democratic executive committee is elected”.What has surprised many is the composition of the committee. Rather than forming an independent panel to ensure that none from the two opposing factions could act unilaterally or in a prejudiced manner, World Boxing – led by its president Boris van der Vorst – opted to designate Singh as the chairman of the six-member committee, predominantly surrounded by his associates.Other members include BFI vice president Narender Kumar Nirwan, executive director Arun Malik, Olympian L Sarita Devi, a nominee of the India Olympic Committee (IOA) and Singapore boxing association’s president Fairuz Mohamed.In the process, the sport’s world body also granted a 90-day window to the current dispensation of the BFI to operate the federation, without providing any timeline to hold the elections. The committee has been instructed to submit its first report to the world body within 30 days of the issuance of this notification (April 7), outlining the steps taken, processes adopted and the roadmap ahead.Several stakeholders have raised concerns over this development, owing to the ongoing legal, financial and administrative dispute between Singh and his loyalists and the rival faction, which is promoting former union sports minister Anurag Thakur as its presidential candidate.“Overseeing financial matters, including the operation and management of BFI’s bank accounts, to ensure transparency and discipline; representing BFI in all ongoing and future legal proceedings, with the authority to act in the best interests of the federation and initiating the revision and alignment of the BFI constitution in line with World Boxing’s statutes and Indian legal requirements,” are some of the responsibilities of the interim committee.The BFI elections , originally planned for Feb 2, were rescheduled for March 28 but have since been postponed.",Ajay Singh-led Boxing Federation of India put the elections for the new executive committee on hold.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.
