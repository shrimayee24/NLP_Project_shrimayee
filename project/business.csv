SC sets free over a dozen convicted for murders by trial courts and HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/over-a-dozen-convicted-by-trial-courts-and-hcs-set-free-by-supreme-court-in-a-year/articleshow/119063163.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: In the last one year, the Supreme Court has acquitted more than a dozen persons, who were convicted concurrently by the trial courts and the High Courts and sentenced to death or life imprisonment, in cases that included rape-cum-murder of a 10-year-old girl and manslaughters.Despite repeated SC rulings that concurrent decisions of the trial courts and HCs are not to be interfered with unless found to be ‘perverse’, the SC in majority of these dozen cases in short 8-10 page judgments punched holes in prosecution evidence, which were cogent in the eyes of the trial courts and the HCs, to conclude that guilt of the convicts are not proved beyond reasonable doubt.In each of these cases, acquittal by SC came after more than a decade of the incident. The HCs and the SC took a long time to decide the appeals of the convicts even though the trial courts had recorded convictions cases within a year or two. In most cases the convicts, prior to their acquittal, had spent years behind bars. In one case, the convict had spent 13 years, virtually a life sentence.If they were innocent, or not found guilty, who would give them back their prime years? Can they be compensated monetarily as after being convicted by the trial courts and the HCs, they would not be accepted in any job. There is no provision in the criminal law that mandates the government to compensate a person who was innocent yet lodged to jail? Should the constitutional courts, where the appeals remained pending for years, be saddled with costs for delayed justice?A more important question arises as heinous crimes involving manslaughter or rape-cum-murder go unpunished. What message would the SC, which has repeatedly advised the courts to be alive to the ‘cry for justice’ of the society, send to the murdered person's parents and relatives, who had felt justice had prevailed with the concurrent convictions by the courts below?Take for example the case of a 10-year-old girl, who to quench her thirst in the searing heat of May while grazing her goats, goes to a tubewell and was raped and murdered by the tubewell operator (Ashok Vs Uttar Pradesh; judgment on Dec 2, 2024). He was convicted and sentenced to death by the trial court. The Allahabad HC confirmed the conviction but reduced the sentence to imprisonment till death.But a bench headed by Justice A S Oka, who in fact is the author of most of the dozen instances of acquittal last year in heinous crimes, found that the accused was not given a legal aid counsel during the trial to enable him defend himself properly, thus prejudicing him during the trial.“After 15 years of the incident, it would be unjust if the appellant is now told to explain the circumstances and material specifically appearing against him in the evidence,” the bench had said in a 37-page judgment, 20 of which were devoted to towards mandatory obligation of trial courts as well as prosecution to provide accused persons with legal aid if they are unable to engage an advocate.Another important question, that emerges from reversal of concurrent judgments by the SC, is whether the sessions court judges, who are senior judicial officers, and the HC judges not trained enough to shift the chaff from the grain while scrutinising evidence in sensitive criminal cases?Justice Oka led bench seems to adopt the maxim ‘it is better that 100 guilty persons should escape, than that one innocent person should suffer’. In the criminal justice system of India, police are not obliged to resume investigations into murder cases if the convict gets acquitted by the highest court. For years, they take satisfaction that the evidence collected by them resulted in conviction in trial court and confirmed by the HC. But, in the dozen cases of acquittal, the murders would remain a mystery.","Supreme Court has acquitted more than a dozen persons, who were convicted concurrently by the trial courts and the High Courts.

SILIGURI: A real-life ""Jurassic Park"" is taking shape in the cloud-draped Eastern Himalayas - not to resurrect dinosaurs, but a last stand for species on the brink. Here, among red pandas and snow leopards, science is not cloning the past, but saving what remains of the present.Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park in Darjeeling is India's first ""frozen zoo"" - a genetic ark preserving the DNA of Himalayan wildlife in steel tanks filled with liquid nitrogen at temperatures plunging to -196°C.A collaboration between the zoo and Hyderabad-based Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, the cryogenic conservation initiative aims to ensure that even if these species dwindle in the wild, their genetic blueprints remain intact. ""This is an effort to preserve DNA samples,"" said Debal Roy, Bengal's chief wildlife warden.Bengal's chief wildlife warden Debal Roy said, ""We will collect tissue samples from wild animals. If an animal dies naturally or due to unnatural causes such as road kill, we have decided to take their tissue samples and preserve them in this facility.""Spread across 67.8 acres at an altitude of 2,150 metres (7,050ft), the zoo is India's highest-altitude zoological park and a leader in conservation breeding programmes for red pandas, snow leopards, and Tibetan wolves. It has also undertaken conservation work for species like the Markhor (screw-horned goat), Mishmi takin, and Himalayan black bear.Unlike traditional zoos, where animals are showcased for visitors, this facility has a dual role - housing live animals while also banking their genetic legacy. Frozen zoos are gaining traction globally, offering a last line of defence against extinction.In Darjeeling, bio-banking efforts began in July last year, with scientists collecting and preserving genetic material from captive animals such as red pandas, Himalayan black bears, snow leopards, and gorals.""As of now, we have started with captive animals,"" zoo director Basavaraj Holeyachi said. ""We have developed a dedicated lab inside the zoo where we preserve gametes and DNA of endangered species .""The process involves two levels of preservation: genetic sampling, which requires storage at -20°C and bio-banking, where tissues must be submerged in liquid nitrogen at -196°C. Scientists prepare the samples to prevent cell damage.""The frozen zoo contains irreplaceable genetic material - living cell lines, gametes, and embryos - that are vital for conservation efforts, assisted reproduction, and evolutionary biology,"" Holeyachi said.In the future, stored genetic material could be used for assisted reproduction techniques, including the possibility of using surrogate mothers to revive species. ""As long as there is a continuous supply of liquid nitrogen, these tissues can be stored indefinitely,"" said an official. The facility's efforts have drawn international recognition, with World Association of Zoos and Aquariums recently shortlisting it for its red panda conservation initiatives.As habitats shrink and climate change alters ecosystems, the frozen zoo may hold the key to ensuring that the ghostly silhouettes of snow leopards and the playful rustlings of red pandas continue to be more than just echoes of the past.","Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park in Darjeeling is India's first ""frozen zoo"" It is a genetic ark preserving the DNA of Himalayan wildlife in steel tanks filled with liquid nitrogen at temperatures plunging to -196°C.

BENGALURU: Forget Chandrayaan, Isro. If you really want to test lunar terrain, just get your mission vehicles to take a drive down Bellandur's crater-riddled roads! This was the new cry that echoed in the IT hub Wednesday.With deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar scheduled to visit Bellandur at 4pm, hundreds of residents hit the road at Devarabeesanahalli near Sakra Hospital. Waving placards that read, ‘No Need for Moon Mission, Isro — Just Drive Here!', frustrated residents chanted ""Beku beku, road beku."" That Shivakumar did not turn up only left them angry and frustrated.""This road has been in a terrible condition for the last six months,"" said Kusum Sahay , an elderly resident, adding, ""There are no pavements for pedestrians, and stepping out of a car itself is a challenge.""Venkat, another resident, fumed over the neglect of one of the city's key localities. ""We are the creme de la creme of Bengaluru, yet infrastructure here is cringe-worthy. This is a major road connecting Koramangala and Indiranagar — how hard is it to fix it quickly?""A resident of Mantri Espana highlighted the daily struggle. ""We moved here two years ago hoping things would improve, but nothing has changed. Just yesterday (Tuesday), I took my father to an eye hospital — a seven-minute drive took 20 minutes because of these crater-sized potholes. For elderly people, walking to Sakra Hospital is impossible. We are forced to take cars even for short distances, and that just adds to the traffic chaos.""Kanchana Ganeshan, another protester, recalled how she used to cycle on the lake road four years ago. ""Now, I wouldn't dare. What used to be a smooth ride turned into a bone-rattling nightmare. Every day, travelling just seven kilometres is an ordeal.""Rajesh Narka, representing Bellandur Rising 2025 initiative, called for swift action.

DMK's response

What's the issue?



NEW DELHI: Amid the ongoing debate between the Union government and Tamil Nadu over language policy, Andhra Pradesh deputy chief minister and Janasena Party chief Pawan Kalyan said on Saturday that claims of Hindi being imposed are misleading.""Either imposing a language forcibly or opposing a language blindly; both doesn’t help to achieve the objective of National & Cultural integration of our Bharat. I had never opposed Hindi as a language. I only opposed making it compulsory. When the NEP 2020 itself does not enforce Hindi, spreading false narratives about its imposition is nothing but an attempt to mislead the public,"" Kalyan said.He pointed out that under the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, students can choose to study any two Indian languages along with a foreign language. ""If they do not wish to study Hindi, they can and also opt for Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam, Kannada, Marathi, Sanskrit, Gujarati, Assamese, Kashmiri, Odia, Bengali, Punjabi, Sindhi, Bodo, Dogri, Konkani, Maithili, Meitei, Nepali, Santali, Urdu, or any other Indian language,"" he said.Kalyan’s statement comes in response to Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin , who has accused the Union government of imposing Hindi and has refused to implement the three-language formula under NEP.Earlier, on Friday also Kalyan had criticized Tamil Nadu leaders, questioning why they allow Tamil films to be dubbed in Hindi for financial gain while opposing the language. Speaking at his party’s foundation day event in Kakinada district, he said, ""In Tamil Nadu, people oppose the imposition of Hindi. This makes me wonder if they don't want Hindi, then why do they dub Tamil films in Hindi for financial gains? They want money from Bollywood but refuse to accept Hindi. What kind of logic is that?""He also highlighted the importance of multiple languages for national unity. ""India needs multiple languages, including Tamil, not just two. We must embrace linguistic diversity—not only to maintain the integrity of our nation but also to foster love and unity among its people,"" he added.DMK leader TKS Elangovan responded to Kalyan's statement by saying that Tamil Nadu has always followed a two-language policy, with Tamil and English being taught in schools. ""We have been opposing Hindi since 1938. We passed legislation in the state assembly that Tamil Nadu will always follow the two-language formula because of the advice and suggestions of the experts in education, not actors. The bill was passed way back in 1968 when Pawan Kalyan was not even born. He doesn't know the politics of Tamil Nadu,"" Elangovan said.Actor Prakash Raj also commented, saying, ""Saying 'don't impose your Hindi on us' is not the same as hating another language. It is about protecting our mother tongue and our cultural identity with pride.""Tamil Nadu chief minister Stalin, speaking at a rally in Thiruvallur on March 12, criticized the NEP, saying it was not aimed at education but at promoting Hindi. ""National Education Policy is not education policy; it is saffron policy. The policy is not created to develop India but to develop Hindi. We are opposing the policy as it would destroy the Tamil Nadu education system completely,"" Stalin had said.The debate over the National Education Policy (NEP) centers around its three-language formula, which Tamil Nadu fears could lead to the imposition of Hindi in the state. Chief Minister MK Stalin has argued that the policy prioritizes Hindi over regional languages, affecting the state’s linguistic diversity and autonomy.The central government, however, maintains that the NEP promotes multilingualism and offers flexibility in language education. Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan has denied claims of Hindi imposition, stating that states have the freedom to choose their preferred languages under the policy.The dispute intensified after the Centre withheld Rs 2,152 crore allocated for Tamil Nadu’s Samagra Shiksha scheme, citing the state’s refusal to implement the NEP.Tamil Nadu has historically opposed the three-language formula, viewing it as a step toward enforcing Hindi, while the central government argues that the policy helps students access employment opportunities across different regions.","Andhra Pradesh deputy chief minister and Janasena Party chief Pawan Kalyan said on Saturday that claims of Hindi being imposed are misleading.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) on Friday informed a special court that the Karnataka police protocol ffficer was involved in a gold smuggling racket linked to actress Ranya Rao. Opposing her bail plea, the central agency told the Special Court for Economic Offences that Rao had traveled to Dubai 27 times since January this year.Ranya is the stepdaughter of K Ramachandra Rao, a DGP-rank officer serving as the managing director of Karnataka state police housing and infrastructure development corporation.The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) is India's top anti-smuggling agency operating under the Central Board of Indirect Taxes & Customs, which falls under the ministry of finance. Its role includes identifying and preventing smuggling activities involving contraband, drug trafficking, illegal trade in wildlife and environmentally sensitive goods, as well as tackling commercial fraud and Customs duty evasion in international trade.The court denied bail to Ranya on Friday after hearing DRI’s arguments. The agency said that investigations had uncovered a methodical approach to smuggling gold. ""The investigation till date has unearthed the sophisticated methodology used in smuggling the gold, usage of State Police Protocol Officer to bypass security, Hawala Transaction to transfer the funds from India to Dubai to purchase gold, involvement of larger syndicate,"" the DRI said.Judge Vishwanath C Gowdar, who presided over the case, took these claims into account while passing the order.""In the case on hand, the accused No 1 (Ranya) possessing Resident Identity Card of UAE and having history of traveled to Dubai on 27 occasions since January 2025, is another factor which does not incline the court to extend discretionary relief of granting bail to accused,"" the court said.Ranya was arrested on March 3 at Kempegowda International Airport after gold bars worth Rs 12.56 crore were found in her possession. Following this, authorities searched her residence and recovered gold jewelry worth Rs 2.06 crore and Rs 2.67 crore in cash.The DRI further informed the court that the investigation was ongoing to establish international connections. It also mentioned that Ranya had not cooperated during custody.""It is also specifically contended that the alleged offence is cognizable, non-bailable, and punishable with imprisonment up to seven years,"" the court observed.The agency said the offence had serious implications for the country’s economy and security.According to the court, ""The remand applications placed on record at this stage of proceedings, disclose the conspiracy hatched by the accused No1 (Ranya) by colluding with State Police Protocol Officer.""It also noted, ""The arguments of the complainant Agency as to the usage of Hawala transaction for transfer of money from India to Dubai and also the International links being forthcoming as per the preliminary investigation is also a factor which inclines this court to hold the accused.""The judge said that Ranya had the capacity to manipulate evidence and witnesses, which could affect the trial.""The apprehension of the complainant as to the accused No.1 will throttle the witnesses and flee away from the process of court cannot be ruled out at this juncture,"" the court observed.The court noted that the allegations against her were evident at this stage, and her method of concealing gold in the form of bars while traveling showed her intent.Apart from DRI, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) are also looking into the case.Meanwhile, on March 10, the Karnataka government appointed additional chief secretary Gaurav Gupta to investigate the role, if any, of Ramachandra Rao in the smuggling case involving his stepdaughter.","The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) is India's top anti-smuggling agency.

Decoding the statement

Left-Congress dilemma

A calculated electoral strategy?

Himanta Biswa Sarma playbook

Road Ahead for non-BJP parties

NEW DELHI: ""We will follow what Kejriwal did in Delhi."" No, Suvendu Adhikari , Leader of the Opposition (LoP) in the West Bengal Assembly, wasn't referring to model schools or mohalla clinics. Instead, the former TMC strongman was drawing parallels to the unceremonious expulsion of Vijender Gupta from the Delhi Assembly when AAP enjoyed a supermajority, juxtaposing it with Gupta's recent elevation as Speaker. Suvendu's assertion was that once the BJP assumes power in Bengal next year, Muslim TMC MLAs who manage to win will be picked up and thrown out of the Assembly—just as Gupta had been removed.A dynast politician best known for defeating Mamata Banerjee in the 2021 Assembly elections from his home turf of Nandigram, Suvendu has steadily escalated his anti-Muslim rhetoric since his induction into the BJP. However, even by his standards, this latest remark has sent shockwaves across Bengal’s political landscape, drawing sharp rebukes from opposition ranks, including the Chief Minister herself. Speaking from the Assembly, Mamata Banerjee vowed to protect the interests of all communities and warned Suvendu against ""playing with fire."" Meanwhile, a mid-level Congress leader, former MLA Viktor, has filed an FIR against the LoP. The crucial question, however, is why Suvendu is adopting such an incendiary tone when the state elections are still more than a year away.To many observers, Suvendu's latest outburst is a desperate attempt to keep his flock intact amid swirling rumours that nearly eight BJP MLAs are on the verge of defecting. In 2021, the BJP had surged from three to a record 77 seats, largely on the back of an en masse shift in votes from the Left and Congress. This catapulted the party to the position of principal opposition, with Suvendu playing a pivotal role in the turnaround. Expectedly, he was rewarded with the LoP post, making him the most visible face of Bengal BJP, gradually overshadowing veterans like Dilip Ghosh and Sukanta Majumdar. However, subsequent electoral outcomes have not favoured the BJP. It's number in the Assembly has steadily dwindled, with unofficial count of around 65. The party’s Lok Sabha tally in Bengal shrank from 18 to 12. Subsequently, it failed to capitalise on public anger over the RG Kar incident, where urban pockets of the state erupted in protests over the rape and murder of a young doctor. In by-elections held after the protests, BJP won nothing even losing seat it had previously held. The defection of Haldia MLA Tapasi Mondal further weakened Suvendu’s grip—especially since Haldia, a crucial port town in his home district of Purba Medinipur, has long been considered his pocket borough. A mutiny in his backyard signalled to TMC that even Purba Midnapore could be in play in 2026. Against this backdrop, Suvendu’s aggressive rhetoric serves as a strategic ploy to shift focus from BJP’s precarious position to the more convenient narrative of Hindu-Muslim polarisation, ensuring that former Left and Congress voters who had switched to the BJP do not reconsider their allegiance.For the Left, which ruled Bengal for over three decades, the crisis is existential. Its vote share plummeted from 26% in 2016 to just over 5% in 2021. The party’s performance in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections remained lacklustre, mirroring Congress’s struggles. Both parties have failed to grasp Bengal’s evolving political climate, where welfare politics and religious identity now determine electoral fortunes—a stark departure from the days when ironclad ideology alone dictated voting patterns. The Left’s lack of prominent mass leaders hastened its decline, while its alliance with Congress has yielded minimal electoral dividends due to limited vote transfer capabilities. Yet, the RG Kar protests backed by Left supported forces briefly rekindled interest about them among Bengal’s intelligentsia. Whether this translates into electoral gains remains uncertain, but Suvendu’s renewed pitch threatens to derail any organisational resurgence the Left may have hoped for. Unsurprisingly, the Left has maintained a guarded stance on the issue, criticising both TMC and BJP. Its votes are scattered across the state—insufficient to win seats outright but enough to play spoiler in a really close contest. That leverage is precisely what Suvendu seeks to neutralise.Congress’s situation is slightly different. Its vote base is primarily concentrated in three North Bengal districts—Malda, Murshidabad, and North Dinajpur—where it competes with the TMC for Muslim votes, particularly in Malda and Murshidabad. Unsurprisingly, the party has taken a more combative stance than the Left, registering vociferous protests, filing FIR, and vowing to safeguard Muslim interests. However, political analysts argue that with the deepening of religious fault lines, these tactics may not suffice.Political commentator Sibaji Pratim Basu believes Suvendu’s statements are not impulsive but part of a calculated strategy. Bengal’s Muslim population stands at around 31%, with the majority voting for TMC. Mamata Banerjee understands that even securing 25-30% of the Hindu vote ensures a decisive victory under the first-past-the-post system. With extensive welfare schemes targeting women, TMC starts from an advantageous position. Suvendu’s objective is to fracture this vote bank, attempting to consolidate Hindu votes in BJP’s favour. However, Professor Basu dismisses this as a pipe dream. He also believes that as long as Narendra Modi remains Prime Minister and the BJP holds national power, Bengal’s Muslim voters are unlikely to abandon Mamata Banerjee. He suggests that only a shift in Delhi’s political landscape could trigger a realignment of Muslim votes in Bengal—but until then, the TMC has little to worry about.Suvendu likely understands this reality, which explains why he has all but abandoned efforts to woo Muslim voters. Instead, he is emulating the playbook of Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma. In Assam, where Muslims form a significant demographic, Himanta has aggressively consolidated Hindu votes by raising voice against 'Miya Muslims'—who originally hailed from present day Bangladesh—questioning their presence in Upper Assam and portraying them as a demographic threat to indigenous Assamese communities. From the Assembly, Himanta made it clear that he would not allow 'Miya Muslims' to dominate Assam’s political discourse. Suvendu appears to be taking a similar approach in Bengal.Mamata Banerjee, while condemning Suvendu’s remarks, also took the opportunity to attack his shifting political allegiances, remarking that he would readily switch sides again if offered the right deal. The West Bengal CM denounced Suvendu’s comments as unbecoming of a leader of his stature, accusing him of deliberately making polarising statements during Ramzan to provoke Muslim sentiments. Interestingly, Mamata also claimed she had instructed Minister and Kolkata Mayor Firhad Hakim and others to refrain from making religious comments tacitly acknowledging that opposition allegations of appeasement politics—though largely exaggerated—were not entirely baseless. She cleverly roped PM Modi into the debate, questioning why Suvendu takes issue with Muslim communities in Bengal but remains silent when Modi praises Arab nations during his foreign visits. Invoking the teachings of Ramakrishna and Vivekananda , Mamata accused Suvendu of promoting a version of Hinduism incompatible with the scriptures and seers. While Mamata exercised restraint, one of her party MLA, Humayun Kabir, has already threatened Suvendu Adhikari of dire consequences if he doesn't withdraw his statement. BJP leader though wasted no time to reject Humayun's demand.Mamata’s balancing act is evident—she seeks to reassure her Muslim base without alienating Hindu voters. Even on the Bangladesh issue, she has taken a proactive stance, preempting BJP’s attempts to polarise voters, by repeatedly questioning what the Modi government is doing to protect Hindu interests there. Mamata Banerjee has also warmed up to ISF, a party predominantly catering to Muslim constituents. This is to counter AIMIM, which has already announced that it will contest in all seats in Bengal. It believes the state has close to 40% Muslim votes and deserves a party like AIMIM.The INDIA alliance remains in limbo and TMC has already announced it will contest the Assembly election alone, like the Lok Sabha polls. While the Congress and Left may or may not ally, their challenge remains formidable, they must first establish themselves as a credible opposition force.For now, Suvendu Adhikari has ensured that the political discourse in Bengal remains firmly centered on polarization, a calculated gamble. With Mamata Banerjee adeptly navigating the tightrope between reassuring Muslim voters and addressing Hindu concerns, the BJP has its work cut out. But at least it doesn't need to worry too much about significantly sharing the opposition space with Left-Congress.","Suvendu Adhikari's 'Muslim MLAs to be thrown out' claim: Why the Left-Congress may be the real loser.

Only days spent in India to decide NRI tax status: ITAT,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/only-days-spent-in-india-to-decide-nri-tax-status-itat/articleshow/119029053.cms,"Mumbai :

The Mumbai Income-tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) has ruled in favour of an individual who claimed his tax residential status to be that of a ‘ non-resident ’ as he had spent 210 days on work abroad.As India does not tax overseas income in the hands of a non-resident, M Gulati did not disclose his overseas income of Rs 1.2 crore for the financial year 2015-16. He contended he had spent less than 182 days in the country and was a non-resident. But I-T claimed that of the 210 days, he had spent 28 days looking for work, and hence a tax resident of India. ITAT made it clear an individual’s tax residential status must be determined solely by the number of days spent in India.The ITAT rejected the contention of the Income-tax (IT) department, which had recomputed Gulati’s stay outside India as it partly comprised of days spent job-hunting. The ITAT order provides clarity on the tax treatment of individuals who split their time between employment and job search abroad. It reinforces that any period spent outside India for employment or in search of employment should be counted towards non-resident status determination.The decision will benefit expatriates who go overseas in search of a job and gain employment.A person who is a tax resident of India has to pay tax on his global income. A non-resident does not pay tax in India on his or her overseas income but only on the income that accrues or arises in India (example: rent from property in India, bank interest, etc).The number of days stayed in India determines the tax residency status.Under provisions of the I-T Act, viz: Explanation 1 to section 6(1), if an individual leaves India for the ‘purpose of employment’ overseas, he or she will qualify as a tax resident only if the stay ‘in India’ is for 182 days or more in a particular year.From financial year 2020-21, the period was reduced to 120 days or more, for those individuals whose total income (other than foreign sources) exceeds Rs 15 lakh.The I-T officer noted Gulati had spent 210 days outside India in the relevant assessment year (AY 2016-17), of which 28 days were in search of employment.He held that only the days of actual employment could be considered. Thus, based on a revised calculation, he held that Gulati had spent more than 182 days in India and was hence a tax resident. Consequently, the overseas salary of Rs 86.2 lakh and interest income of Rs 2.8 lakh would be taxable in India. The Appellate Commissioner upheld the stand of the I-T officer by holding that during the 28-day period, the taxpayer had not received any salary and the adjustment in days was correctly made.However, the ITAT relying on judicial precedents disagreed and overruled the I-T department’s stand. The tax tribunal held that seeking employment abroad also qualifies as a legitimate purpose under Explanation 1 to section 6 (1). An individual’s tax residential status must be determined solely based on number of days spent in India.",M Gulati did not disclose his overseas income of Rs 1.2 crore for the financial year 2015-16. He contended he had spent less than 182 days in the country and was a non-resident. The number of days stayed in India determines the tax residency status.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119029202,imgsize-984713,width-400,resizemode-4/119029202.jpg"

While traveling from India to Dubai, people are curious about the legal restrictions on carrying gold. Whether you are carrying gold for personal consumption or as a gift, it is important to know the customs rules and duties to prevent any legal issues. India has certain regulations regarding the amount of gold you can carry, and carrying more than that can lead to heavy fines or confiscation. In this comprehensive guide, we'll take you through the main customs rules, gold duty rates, and advice on avoiding running afoul of Indian laws while carrying gold. Stay updated to make your trip smooth and problem-free.As per the CBIC guidelines, Indian passengers returning from Dubai after a stay of more than six months can bring up to 1 kg of gold with them. However, as per Economic Times report, this is allowed only if they pay the applicable customs duty. The gold can be in the form of jewelry, coins, or bars. It is important for travelers to carry proper documentation, such as purchase invoices, that provide details on the price, purity, and date of purchase. These documents are required for verification during customs clearance at Indian airports, ensuring the process goes smoothly and in compliance with regulations.Men returning to India from Dubai are allowed to carry up to 20 grams of gold, with a maximum value of Rs 50,000, duty-free. If they exceed this limit, customs duty will apply.Women are allowed to bring up to 40 grams of gold, valued at Rs 1 lakh, without paying customs duty.

Customs officers assess the value of the gold and apply the corresponding duty rate. To avoid complications, it’s crucial to have accurate invoices and certificates for purity and weight. As per reports from Economic Times, If the proper documentation is not provided, the traveler may face penalties, including confiscation of the gold.If you’re carrying more gold than the duty-free limit allows, you must declare it at the airport.

No deadline for J&K quota review panel: Minister,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-deadline-for-jk-quota-review-panel-minister/articleshow/119054697.cms,"SRINAGAR: J&K’s reservation policy is back on the boil with the Omar Abdullah-led National Conference (NC) government telling the assembly Saturday that it had not set a timeline for a ministerial review panel to submit its report.“The cabinet sub-committee stands constituted to examine grievances regarding reservation rules. However, no specific timeline has been fixed for submitting the report,” social welfare minister Sakeena Itoo said in response to a question from opposition People’s Conference MLA Sajad Lone. Itoo heads the panel constituted after quota protests in Dec 2024 with cabinet colleagues Satish Sharma and Javed Rana as the other members.Reservations in J&K are as high as 60%, making it a hot-button issue following the Centre’s decision to add more communities and expand quotas since the 2019 abrogation of special status under Article 370 and its conversion into a Union Territory. Many fear the quotas will be hiked to 70%.Lone cited data and flagged stark regional disparities, alleging the quotas favoured Jammu areas and were “rigged” against Kashmir -- a Muslim-majority region.Itoo said 5.39 lakh people -- 4.59 lakh in Jammu (85.3%) and 79,813 in Kashmir (14.7%) -- had been issued Scheduled Tribe (ST) certificates in the past two years. During the same period, 67,112 Scheduled Caste (SC) certificates had been issued in Jammu.Lone seized on the numbers to highlight the disparity, calling the data a “shocker”. “Kashmir as a region is far behind. The net loss of quotas to Kashmiri-speaking population is of a much higher scale than we had thought,” the MLA argued.According to Lone, Kashmiris, including Pandits are “victims” of the reservation policy. He cited data for other categories such as Economically Weaker Sections (EWS), Reserved Backward Areas, Actual Line of Control category to allege similar biases against Kashmir. “ST category showed Jammu issuing 4.59 lakh certificates (85.3%) while Kashmir only 79,813 (14.7%). Similar imbalances exist for EWS -- 92.3% in Jammu and 7.7% in Kashmir,” Lone said.The Handwara MLA made it clear he was not against reservations but “murder of merit”, calling the current quotas a “post-dated cheque for disaster”. “There is a reservation of 60%. But within that reservation is a much bigger scam. Kashmiris not making it to KAS (Kashmir Administrative Service) or other exams is not because they are incompetent. It is the scourge of reservation that is killing their competence,” Lone said.Slamming the Itoo-headed committee, he said it lacked a specific timeline for submitting its report despite previous indications of a six-month deadline. The committee was set up after NC’s Srinagar MP Aga Ruhullah Mehdi led protests by students outside CM Omar’s residence against the current reservation policy on Dec 23 last year.","Reservations in J&K are as high as 60%, making it a hot-button issue.

"Prolonged use of steroids linked to risk of glaucoma, AIIMS docs warn",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/prolonged-use-of-steroids-linked-to-risk-of-glaucoma-aiims-docs-warn/articleshow/119054734.cms,"New Delhi: Prolonged use of steroid-based inhalers for respiratory conditions like asthma and bronchitis, continuous application of nasal sprays for allergies, and steroid-containing skin creams for allergic reactions and cosmetic purposes may lead to glaucoma , doctors at AIIMS have observed.They have highlighted the issue and advised regular eye check-ups , indicating that early identification significantly improves the chances of vision preservation. Glaucoma is a persistent eye condition that can damage the optic nerve, potentially causing vision loss or blindness.Dr Tanuj Dada, professor-in-charge of the glaucoma unit, emphasised the significance of timely detection. ""Glaucoma is known as the thief of vision because it has no symptoms until significant damage occurs. After 40, regular check-ups every 1-2 years are essential, even if your vision seems fine.""Dr Dada also cautioned against steroid misuse for children who are often prescribed steroid eye drops by unqualified persons, resulting in glaucoma. He explained that they frequently encountered young children with eye allergies, particularly those from Rajasthan affected by sand-related allergic reactions. These children, when experiencing eye irritation and redness, often get medicines from chemists or seek assistance from unqualified practitioners. Although the immediate allergy symptoms and redness may subside, some children later develop glaucoma.Students sustaining eye injuries from sports equipment such as balls or shuttlecocks during playground activities should also undergo regular eye examinations as these injuries could progress to glaucoma after 10-20 years.The doctor also warned against the use of skin whitening creams that mostly contain steroids.Early-stage detection significantly increases the chances of preserving vision. This service is accessible at every govt-run hospital, said doctors.Emphasising the need for lifelong care, Dr Dada pointed out, ""Once diagnosed, you must use eye drops for life — stopping treatment can lead to further vision loss. New laser treatments and surgeries can help, but unlike cataract surgery, glaucoma surgery only preserves remaining vision; it cannot restore what is lost.""According to doctors, the AIIMS research also linked stress to glaucoma, with meditation and breathing exercises showing potential benefits.Dr Praveen Vashist, professor and officer-in-charge of community ophthalmology, highlighted the need for nationwide screening. ""Most people with glaucoma don't know they have it. We need more awareness and screening programs at the primary care level.""AIIMS operates 21 vision centres offering AI-based glaucoma detection tests, he noted, underlining the need to expand such facilities across India. He also emphasised the importance of adherence to medication, ""Putting more than one drop at a time is wasteful — regularity is the key.""","Glaucoma is a persistent eye condition that can damage the optic nerve, potentially causing vision loss or blindness.

New TDS rules : Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s Union Budget 2025 presentation included significant modifications to TDS (Tax Deducted At Source) regulations, offering financial benefits to various taxpayer categories, including senior citizens, investors and commission earners. These changes in TDS rules will take effect from April 1, 2025.The Union Budget 2025 aimed to increase disposable income for middle-class and senior citizens. Starting April 1, 2025 interest earnings from FDs, RDs and similar instruments will face deductions only when the cumulative amount in a bank surpasses Rs 1 lakh during a financial year, according to an ET report. Senior citizens maintaining interest earnings below Rs 1 lakh will be exempt from bank TDS deductions.For regular citizens, the government has raised the TDS threshold on interest income to Rs 50,000 from Rs 40,000, beginning April 2025. This adjustment seeks to decrease depositors' tax obligations, particularly affecting individuals dependent on FD interest for primary income.Also Read | Highest FD rates up to 9%: Which small finance banks are offering good fixed deposit interest rates? Check list Under the new regulations, banks will implement TDS when yearly interest totals exceed Rs 50,000. Regular citizens keeping interest earnings within Rs 50,000 will avoid TDS deductions.The government has streamlined TDS regulations for lottery winnings, crossword puzzles, and horse racing by eliminating the yearly aggregate threshold of Rs 10,000. The new regulation specifies that TDS applies only when a single winning exceeds Rs 10,000, replacing the previous system where tax was deducted when cumulative winnings surpassed Rs 10,000 annually.For instance: If someone wins Rs 8,000 three times, totalling Rs 24,000, no TDS will apply under the new rule, as each individual win is below Rs 10,000. Previously, TDS would have been applicable on the total amount, says the ET report.The Budget 2025 introduced higher TDS thresholds for commission earnings . Insurance agents will benefit from an increased TDS threshold of Rs 20,000, up from Rs 15,000, effective April 1, 2025.

Little known byrnihat

NEW DELHI: India was the fifth most polluted country in the world in terms of air quality, with Byrnihat in Meghalaya being the most polluted metropolitan area globally last year, according to IQAir’s 2024 World Air Quality Report released Tuesday.Byrnihat reported an annual average PM2.5 level of 128.2 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) which was more than 25 times higher than WHO-recommended level and over three times more than Indian ambient air quality standards. High air pollution level in the little-known Meghalayan city can be attributed to rapid industrialisation, unregulated emission, construction and deforestation.Though India improved its overall ranking from third most-polluted in 2023 to fifth last year, it had the dubious record of having six of the world’s 10 most polluted cities and 13 of the 20 most polluted cities globally, with Delhi being the most polluted capital in the world in 2024.The report that analysed a critical pollutant particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) data from over 40,000 air quality monitoring stations across 8,954 locations in 138 countries, finds Chad — a central African country — as the most polluted country last year, followed by Bangladesh, Pakistan, Congo and India by exceeding the WHO standards of acceptable limit of that pollutant multiple times.Only seven countries — Australia, Bahamas, Barbados, Estonia, Grenada, Iceland and New Zealand — met WHO annual average PM2.5 guideline level of 5 µg/m3.As far as India is concerned, the report finds that the country with the annual average PM2.5 concentration of 50.6 µg/m3 in 2024 reported more than 10 times higher than the WHO PM2.5 annual guideline and over 26% higher than the acceptable limit of the hazardous pollutant as per Indian national ambient air quality standards.The report shows that India saw a 7% decline in PM2.5 concentrations in 2024, averaging 50.6 µg/m3 compared to 54.4 µg/m3 in 2023, but the capital, New Delhi, maintained consistently high pollution levels, with annual average of 91.6 µg/m3, nearly unchanged from 92.7 µg/m3 in 2023.“Overall, 35% of Indian cities reported annual PM2.5 averages exceeding 10 times WHO guideline,” it says. In 2024, air quality data was reported from 371 cities across 11 countries, with India being the most monitored, hosting more than half of central and south Asia region’s stations. The region was home to the top nine most-polluted cities in the world with six of them in India last year.Citing Air Quality Life Index released by University of Chicago in 2023, IQAir’s report noted that air pollution remains a significant health burden in India, reducing life expectancy by an estimated 5.2 years.PM2.5, which is smaller than 2.5 micrometers, is considered the most hazardous air pollutant. It can be deposited in lungs, causing respiratory problems and other health issues.","Byrnihat reported an annual average PM2.5 level of 128.2 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) It was more than 25 times higher than WHO-recommended level and over three times more than Indian ambient air quality standards.

"Only 388 Indian illegals in US verified, all back: Govt",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/only-388-indian-illegals-in-us-verified-all-back-govt/articleshow/119028170.cms,"NEW DELHI: India has identified 388 illegal Indian immigrants in the US since President Donald Trump launched his mass deportation campaign and all of them have returned to their home country, TOI has learnt. These include the plane-loads of illegals who landed in Amritsar and those who returned from third countries, mostly Panama, with help from the International Organisation for Migration.Verification of nationality is an ongoing process, and more are expected to be deported sooner than later, but not before their nationality is confirmed like in the past. For India, whether it's a million or a few thousand, there's no way of knowing conclusively how many Indians are living illegally in the US as they become Indian only after verification.While extremely large figures - ranging from 200,000 to 700,000 - have been bandied around about the number of Indian illegals in the US, the govt has maintained it has no data about the number of ""undocumented"" Indian immigrants residing in the US. ""The reason is that these immigrants have legally exited India but have either overstayed their US visa validity or have entered the US illegally or without valid documents,'' said junior external affairs minister Kirti Vardhan Singh, responding to a written question in RS earlier.Various Indian agencies closely scrutinise the list of persons identified for deportation by the US and only those who have been verified to be Indian nationals are accepted for deportation. Foreign minister S Jaishankar had said in his statement in Parliament that it is the obligation of all countries to accept their nationals living abroad illegally but it is subject to an ""unambiguous"" verification of their nationality. India has been accepting deportees from the US for the past couple of decades, with the maximum number (2,042) in 2019. Last year, it took back 1,368 illegal Indians.For the Indian govt, the real issue remains the need for a crackdown on what Jaishankar had described in his statement in Parliament last month as the illegal migration industry. He had said that law enforcement agencies will take action against agents facilitating illegal migration.","India has identified 388 illegal Indian immigrants in the US since President Donald Trump launched his mass deportation campaign.

“Phil took a good five count before he even moved from his static position. ‘He is not . . . my brother,’ he finally rasped out.”

Chicago Tribune

“I don't believe you have to be blood to be family. So I have a lot of family members. I have two sisters and a brother by blood. I talk to my sisters but haven't talked to my brother in like 10 years.”

“The only thing my brother ever did to me was steal a (crap) load of money.”

CM Punk doesn’t believe in blood ties—his ‘family’ is the one he chose

CM Punk, real name Phillip Jack Brooks, is one of WWE ’s most divisive figures. He built his entire wrestling persona around rebellion, speaking his mind, and living by the straight-edge philosophy. But dig into his real life, and you’ll see—this isn’t just a gimmick. His family history is complicated. His father was an alcoholic. His mother was cut off for harassing him for money. His brother? Punk doesn’t even acknowledge his existence anymore.This is the real story behind CM Punk’s fractured family ties.Phillip Jack Brooks was born on October 26, 1978, in Chicago, Illinois. His father worked as an electrical engineer. He also struggled with alcoholism.Punk has spoken about one particular childhood memory that stuck with him. His father was picking him up from a Little League game when he suddenly threw up in the car. Punk panicked. He thought it was cancer. Then he realized—it was alcohol. That moment changed everything.That’s where his straight-edge lifestyle comes from. The refusal to drink. The absolute rejection of drugs. The ink on his knuckles that readsIt’s all because of what he saw at home. But here’s what’s important—Punk’s father was never abusive. He just wasn’t present the way Punk needed him to be. And that was enough to make Punk seek support elsewhere.CM Punk’s mother didn’t make things any easier. She had bipolar disorder, and by the time Punk was a successful wrestler, she started reaching out—for money.At first, he helped. He gave her over $100,000. But it wasn’t enough. She wanted more. And when he refused? She allegedly threatened to commit suicide and said she’d expose embarrassing secrets from his past.There were rumors that this had something to do with Punk’s high school days—maybe even arrests—but nothing was ever confirmed. By 2013, Punk had had enough. He filed a restraining order against his own mother. That’s how bad it got.CM Punk wasn’t just estranged from his parents. He cut off his own brother too.Back in the ‘90s, Punk and his brother Mike Brooks co-founded—a backyard wrestling promotion. They built it from the ground up. But then Punk found out that Mike had been stealing money from the company. That was it.Punk hasn’t spoken to Mike since. He doesn’t even call him his brother. CM Venom, another wrestler from LWF, wrote about the moment in his bookMike later claimed on a podcast that he paid the money back. Punk never acknowledged it. In a 2012 interview with, he summed it up like this:And then:No reconciliation. No making amends. CM Punk doesn’t do second chances.This is the part that matters. CM Punk doesn’t believe family is about DNA. He left home as a teenager. Moved in with his best friend’s parents. Found support in people who actually had his back.He has no relationship with his father. His mother? Cut off. His brother? Dead to him. CM Punk built his entire life around the idea that family is earned, not given. And that’s probably why he has no issue burning bridges—even in wrestling.If you betray him once, you’re gone. No explanations. No apologies. Just silence.Also Read: Montez Ford and Bianca Belair's Combined Net Worth in 2025, Salary of Both Superstars and More",Wrestling star CM Punk's family history is complicated.

"Maharashtra among hottest places in India as heat streak continues; Chandrapur sizzles at 42°C, Pune above 40°C",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/maha-among-hottest-places-in-india-as-heat-streak-continues-chandrapur-sizzles-at-42c-pune-above-40c/articleshow/119056161.cms,"PUNE: Parts of Maharashtra, especially locations in Vidarbha, were among the hottest places in India on Saturday as above-normal maximum temperatures continue to persist for over a month, taking a severe toll on those without air-conditioners and adequate cooling facilities.The extended heat spell has been going on since early Feb, with sporadic instances when even night temperatures have been high. These high day temperatures have been coupled with a significant drop in humidity. For instance, in Pune, relative humidity has been in the range of 16-25% during afternoons, making it more uncomfortable.Experts said the combination of high temperatures and low humidity levels ""creates a dangerous situation for the human body"". When humidity is low, sweat evaporates quickly from the skin. This might give a false sense of comfort, but actually accelerates dehydration.Friday's data confirmed the continuing trend, with Chandrapur recording a scorching 41.4°C, making it not only the hottest spot in Maharashtra but also among the hottest locations in India. Other stations were not far behind, with Bramhapuri (41.2°C), Solapur (41.1°C), and Wardha (41°C) crossing the 41°-C mark.Most stations are recording temperatures 3-5 degrees above normal, with Amravati showing a departure of nearly 5 degrees and Wardha 6 degrees above the normal values. The Vidarbha region remains most affected, with seven spots there either touching or crossing the 40°C-mark.The heat continued on Saturday too. Saturday's data showed temperatures climbing even higher across Maharashtra, with Chandrapur recording a blistering 42°C, making it the hottest location in the state and among the hottest ones in India. On Saturday, over nine stations across Maharashtra crossed the 40°C-mark — Akola (41.3°C), Wardha (41°C), Chandrapur (42°C), Bramhapuri (40.8°C), Amravati (40.4°C), Nagpur (40.2°C), Solapur (40.3°C), Lohegaon (40.3°C) and Malegaon (40°C).The Vidarbha region continues to bear the brunt of the heat, with six of its monitoring stations recording temperatures above 40°C. Temperature departures from normal remained significant, with Wardha showing the highest departure at 6 degrees above normal, followed by Chandrapur at 5 degrees, Brahmapuri 4.9 degrees and Akola and Amravati 4.6 degrees above normal.""Heatwave conditions are likely to prevail in Vidarbha region for the next two days,"" said S D Sanap, scientist at IMD Pune. ""We, however, do not anticipate heatwave conditions in Madhya Maharashtra, Konkan or Marathwada during this period. There are indications of light rainfall in Marathwada around March 20-21.""Several locations outside Maharashtra also recorded scorching temperatures on Saturday. In Odisha, Boudh reached 42.5°C, making it the hottest location in the country.Parts of Odisha experienced similarly extreme heat, with Sambalpur (42.2°C), Jharsuguda (41.8°C), and Angul (41.7°C) registering temperatures well above 40°C. Rajnandgaon in Chhattisgarh recorded a maximum temperature of 40.5°C.In Jharkhand, three locations crossed the 40°C threshold, including Chaibasa (41.0°C) and Daltonganj (40.7°C), Telangana's Adilabad also joined the list at 40.8°C.Sanap explained that the current weather models were not yet showing clear signals for pre-monsoon showers in Madhya Maharashtra. ""We are continuously monitoring the situation. At present, we have not issued any rainfall forecast for Madhya Maharashtra.""Sanap confirmed that day temperatures had consistently remained above normal since Feb across most parts of Maharashtra. ""We expect a marginal relief from the current high temperatures starting Sunday or Monday, though the decrease will likely be modest — around 1-2°Celsius. Some moisture incursion has begun, which could influence weather patterns in the coming days,"" he said.In Pune city, Koregaon Park (40.4°C) was the hottest location on Saturday, followed by Lohegaon. Shivajinagar recorded a day temperature of 38.7°C, but the location can expect a drop to 36-37° C in the coming days because of a forecast of partly cloudy skies in afternoon and evening.","Parts of Maharashtra, especially locations in Vidarbha, were among the hottest places in India on Saturday.
