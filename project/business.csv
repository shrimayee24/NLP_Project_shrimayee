NEW DELHI: In a rare development, Delhi HC acted on communication from Supreme Court of England and Wales to record statement of a banker in connection with the Nirav Modi case. In a recent order, HC sought assistance of Centre while issuing notice to all parties, including the fugitive diamantaire.Justice C Hari Shankar said assistance from govt is also needed “as to the future course of action to be taken in this matter, as there does not appear to be any earlier precedent in which the court acted on the basis of a communication from the foreign court, without a party to the matter approaching court”.The UK court sought HC’s intervention to record the testimony of a Delhi-based Bank of India official as a witness in proceedings abroad concerning Firestar Diamond FZE and its founder Nirav Modi in a loan default dispute.The request was communicated to Delhi HC via Union ministry of law and justice under 1970 Hague Convention on “taking of evidence abroad in civil or commercial matters”, HC noted in its order. To facilitate the process, court made the parties to UK proceedings, including Nirav Modi, also a party to the present matter.HC also asked counsel for Bank of India to clarify if they intend to file a formal application in the matter.","Delhi HC acted on communication from Supreme Court of England and Wales to record statement of a banker in connection with the Nirav Modi case.

HC refuses to suspend Sengar jail term in custody death case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hc-refuses-to-suspend-sengar-jail-term-in-custody-death-case/articleshow/126732828.cms,"Unnao Rape Case: Delhi HC Rejects Kuldeep Sengar’s Plea To Suspend Sentence

NEW DELHI: Less than a month after his release was stayed by Supreme Court in the main rape case, Delhi high court on Monday refused to suspend a 10-year jail term handed to expelled BJP functionary Kuldeep Singh Sengar for the custodial death of the Unnao rape survivor’s father.“The offence committed is of grave magnitude and has a deep societal impact,” Justice Ravinder Dudeja observed, rejecting relief sought on the grounds of delay in trial. The HC pointed out that the delay was partly caused by the multiple applications Sengar’s legal team filed in the matter.“Purpose would be served if the appeal were heard on merit in an expeditious manner,” the HC said, listing the appeal for hearing on Feb3.HC said it was “noteworthy” that Sengar has “criminal antecedents in as much as he was convicted in a connected case for the rape of a minor and sentenced to undergo life imprisonment. The existence of such serious antecedents is a significant consideration and militates strongly against suspension (of the sentence).”It highlighted the findings of the trial court that Sengar was a key participant in the conspiracy and that the assault on the rape survivor’s father, and the subsequent falsification of the FIR, were part of that design.“Those findings form the basis of the conviction of the appellant and cannot be set aside lightly at the stage of deciding application for suspension of sentence,” the HC noted.On the argument that circumstances changed since his conviction, the HC said, “No exceptional or compelling circumstance was brought to the fore that would warrant suspension of sentence at this stage. The argument that the appellant underwent approximately 7.5 years of total imprisonment of 10 years RI awarded to him also does not advance his case. The period undergone is relevant but not determinative.”It underscored that when “weighed against the gravity of the crime, the threat perception, the appellant’s antecedents, and the nature of the trial court’s findings, this factor alone cannot warrant suspension.”In 2020, Sengar was sentenced to 10 years’ rigorous imprisonment by a trial court in the case. The trial court said “no leniency” could be shown for killing a family’s “sole bread earner.” It also awarded a 10-year jail term to Sengar’s brother, Atul Singh Sengar, and five others for their role in the custodial killing of the rape survivor’s father.The father was arrested at the behest of Sengar under the Arms Act and died in custody on April 9, 2018, owing to police brutalities. Sengar kidnapped the minor and raped her in 2017. The former lawmaker’s sentence was suspended by HC on Dec 23, 2025, in the main rape case but the order was stayed by the Supreme Court on Dec 29, 2025.","Delhi high court refuses to suspend 10-year jail term handed to expelled BJP functionary Kuldeep Singh Sengar for the custodial death of the Unnao rape survivor’s father. “The offence committed is of grave magnitude and has a deep societal impact,” Justice Ravinder Dudeja observed.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126733020,imgsize-1009135,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

(With inputs from agency)

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday personally received UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan at the airport in New Delhi, a special gesture asserting the close ties between the two countries, as the visiting leader arrived for a brief but high-level official visit.MBZ’s visit, undertaken at the invitation of Prime Minister Modi, comes amid heightened developments in West Asia.Taking to social media platform X, the Prime Minister said, ""Went to the airport to welcome my brother, His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the UAE. His visit illustrates the importance he attaches to a strong India-UAE friendship. Looking forward to our discussions.""The PM later welcomed the UAE president and his family at his official residence on Lok Kalyan Marg.As part of the traditional Indian welcome, PM Modi presented a series of cultural gifts to the visiting dignitaries. President MBZ was gifted a Royal Carved Wooden Jhula (swing) from Gujarat, intricately hand-carved with floral and traditional designs. The jhula, a central fixture in many Gujarati homes, symbolizes togetherness, conversation, and intergenerational bonding, resonating with the UAE’s declaration of 2026 as the Year of Family.In addition, PM Modi presented a handmade Kashmiri Pashmina shawl in an ornate silver box from Telangana, representing India’s rich handloom and handicraft tradition. A similar Pashmina shawl was gifted to Sheikha Fatima bint Mubarak Al Ketbi, accompanied by Kashmiri saffron in an ornate silver box, prized for its deep crimson strands and intense aroma.The ministry of external affairs in a media briefing gave the details of the meeting between the two leaders, which according to foreign secretary “extended beyond the scheduled hours” and happened in both “restricted and expanded format.”The meeting was scheduled for 2 hours, but went well past 3 hours, termed ""substantive"" in terms of the outcome and also setting the tone and direction of India-UAE ties in the near future.The entourage of MBZ included the members of Royal families of both Dubai and Abu Dhabi, and senior ministers and officials of UAE government, reflecting on the importance of the visit.""Amongst the members of the delegation were Sheikh Hamad bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, the managing director of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority; Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, the deputy prime minister and foreign minister of the UAE; Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the Crown Prince of Dubai, also the deputy prime Minister and the minister of defence of the UAE. And also Sheikh Hamdan bin Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, who is the deputy chairman of the Presidential Court. In addition, there were the secretary general of the supreme council for national security, the minister for industry and advanced technology, the minister of state for international cooperation, the minister of state for artificial intelligence, digital economy and remote work applications, and the minister of state for defence affairs. Even for this short visit, this was a really, really high-powered delegation that accompanied the President..."" said the foreign secretary Vikram Misri.Talks between PM Modi and president Nahyan focused on advancing the India-UAE partnership, as well as an exchange of views on regional and global issues of mutual interest, the MEA said.Multiple agreements have been signed and agreed upon between the two countries ranging from nuclear and energy cooperation to railways and space. The leaders also discussed taking the bilateral trade between India and UAE to $200 billion by 2032. They also identified AI as a priority sector.""On the trade front, following the signing of the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement between the two countries in 2022, the bilateral trade has since crossed $100 billion. In view of this, two leaders decided to raise ambitions and look to double bilateral trade to $200 billion by 2032. It was also decided to facilitate exports of the MSME industries to the West Asian, African and Eurasian regions..."" foreign secretary said.He added, ""The two sides decided to explore partnership in advanced nuclear technologies, including development and deployment of large nuclear reactors and small modular reactors, as well as cooperation in advanced reactor systems, nuclear power plant operations, and maintenance and nuclear safety. Artificial Intelligence was identified as a priority area of cooperation. It was decided to collaborate on setting up a supercomputing cluster in India with UAE partnership. The UAE will also look at investments for expanding data centre capacity in India. The UAE will also participate at a high level in the Artificial Intelligence Summit that India is organising in February 2026. Both sides will also explore the possibility of setting up a digital or a data embassy. This is a relatively new concept, but there will be work done to see how these can be set up under mutually recognised sovereignty agreements...""The two sides also decided on establishing the “House of India” in Abu Dhabi. This will be a unique cultural space which will have a state of the art museum reflective of India’s ancient culture, and a lasting symbol of India-UAE partnership, foreign secretary said.UAE has one of the largest Indian diaspora in the world, close to 4.5 million people from India currently living and working in the Middle Eastern nation. The Prime Minister expressed his deep appreciation to the UAE president for looking after the interest of the Indian community.Both leaders also discussed the issues in the Middle East and expressed full support for all efforts to promote peace, security, stability, and prosperity in the region. They also unequivocally condemned the cross border terrorism, and for perpetrators, supporters and financiers of all acts of terrorism to be brought to justice.MBZ also expressed support for India’s chairmanship of BRICS grouping this year, and also confirmed UAE high level participation in the AI impact summit that will be held next month, MEA said.MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal in a post on X shared the list of outcomes.The post said, ""List of Outcomes (12 in total) : Official visit of President HH Sheikh @MohamedBinZayed of UAE to India.""This marks Sheikh Mohamed’s third official visit to India since assuming office as UAE President, and his fifth visit to the country in the past decade, reflecting the frequency of top-level engagement between New Delhi and Abu Dhabi.The visit coincided with ongoing diplomatic activity related to West Asia, with the United States preparing to move to the next phase of its Gaza Peace Plan, which includes the proposed National Committee for the administration of Gaza.Prime Minister Modi has been invited by US President Donald Trump to be part of the Gaza Peace Board, according to a White House statement.India and the UAE have seen sustained engagement across political, economic and defence domains in recent months. Earlier this month, Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi visited the UAE to strengthen military cooperation, while external affairs minister S Jaishankar travelled to Abu Dhabi in December for the India-UAE joint commission Meeting and strategic dialogue.India and the UAE share strong political, economic and people-to-people ties, supported by frameworks such as the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA), the Local Currency Settlement system and a Bilateral Investment Treaty. The two countries also cooperate closely at multilateral forums including the UN, BRICS, I2U2 and the UAE-France-India trilateral.According to the MEA, Sheikh Mohamed’s short visit provides an opportunity for both leaders to review progress in bilateral ties and identify new areas of cooperation amid evolving regional dynamics.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi personally received UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan at the airport in New Delhi. The meeting was scheduled for 2 hours, but went well past 3 hours, termed ""substantive"" in terms of the outcome and also setting the tone and direction of India-UAE ties in the near future.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126678621,imgsize-1416502,width-400,resizemode-4/pm-modi-and-mbz-in-car.jpg"
"DGCA exemptions end on February 10, IndiGo may cut more flights",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dgca-exemptions-end-on-feb-10-indigo-may-cut-more-flights/articleshow/126722651.cms,"NEW DELHI: IndiGo could temporarily reduce some more flights post Feb 10 when it has to implement the new safety-enhancing & humane flight duty time limitation (FDTL) rules.The airline on Monday assured the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) it will ensure there are no disruptions next month under the new rules that increase pilot requirement and for that, it may opt for a short term network readjustment if needed.The airline’s schedule was cut 10% last month after the December fiasco and it currently operates about 2,200 daily scheduled domestic and international flights. Of these 2,200 flights, about 350 are mounted on its turboprop ATR fleet and the rest on Airbus A320/A321s.To minimise fresh cuts from February 10, when the exemption from the new FDTL for its mainstay Airbus A320 family fleet pilots ends, IndiGo will shift some medium to short routes currently served by A320s to ATR.This will slightly reduce the number of flights on A320s and enable the airline to achieve two things — minimise further cuts on the Airbus fleet and operate the slightly more truncated schedule without any hiccups. Both the aviation ministry and DGCA are closely monitoring the process as they, along with IndiGo, are absolutely certain on one thing that a repeat of the chaos witnessed last month can’t be allowed again, let alone as soon as next month.To ensure that, the DGCA has been taking constant updates from IndiGo, including the latest one on Monday.,The regulator is going to cross-check the data submitted by the airline and match it against its proposed post February 10 operations to see that there are no slippages.“If any cuts are needed, the same will be decided well in time to ensure there are no last-minute cancellations, leaving flyers stranded at airports. Affected passengers of flights that may need to be cut after February 10 will need to be informed in time and given the option of a refund or alternate flights. We will not allow any public inconvenience,” said people in the know.IndiGo clearly has to set its house in order, and mend fences with pilots as apart from several other factors, a broken relationship between the aviators and top management had aggravated last month’s crisis.Relatively minor pinpricks like withdrawing night allowance on top of major ones including an inhumane rostering (its Nov 2025 is cited as an example of what a roster should not be); tight schedules with no slack; “arrogance” of some key people & the airline’s record profits being shared only with a handful of top brass & not the regular Joes drove a wedge between pilots and those in C Suites.Pilots are closely watching the action, if any, the airline takes against the “bad apples” identified in its internal and the DGCA probe.Post IndiGo’s schedule collapse last month, the regulator had on Dec 5 given IndiGo a temporary exemption from implementing the new flight duty time limitation (FDTL) rules for its A320 family fleet till February 10, 2026.The DGCA had fined IndiGo Rs 22.2 crore, of which Rs 30 lakh is a daily fine for the 68 days of FDTL exemption between December 5 and February 10 that works out to Rs 20.4 crore.Additionally, the airline has to submit a bank guarantee of Rs 50 crore. Of this release of Rs 15 crore is linked to “initial and sustained compliance over six months of the new FDTL through “manpower planning, rostering and fatigue-risk management.”",IndiGo could temporarily reduce some more flights post Feb 10 when it has to implement the new safety-enhancing & humane flight duty time limitation (FDTL) rules.

EC counsel Rakesh Dwivedi said the commission would take necessary corrective steps.The bench did not agree with Dwivedi when he said that instances where age gap between the voter and his father is 15 years or less, or more than 50 years, and also less than 40 years between grandchildren and grandparents, should be categorised under “logical discrepancy”.The bench said, “We are not in a country where there is no child marriage.”A host of senior advocates — Kapil Sibal, Shyam Divan and Banerjee — appearing for Trinamool Congress politicians complained that EC was adopting absurd criteria for issuing notices citing “logical discrepancy”.Dwivedi said notices are issued to produce relevant documents so that the discrepancies are corrected.",Almost 1.4 crore West Bengal voters face ‘logical discrepancy’ notices requiring documentary proof for the special intensive revision (SIR) Supreme Court ordered the Election Commission on Monday to display the list of such people in panchayat and block offices and gave them 10 more days to furnish documents.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126723199,imgsize-743936,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday directed the Election Commission of India (ECI) to display the names of all 1.25 crore electors categorised under “logical discrepancies” during the ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in West Bengal, where assembly elections are expected in April-May.A three-judge bench led by Chief Justice of India Surya Kant issued the order while hearing pleas alleging procedural irregularities in the SIR exercise.“The ECI has issued notices to certain persons described as falling under the category of 'logical discrepancies'. With a view to enabling these persons, we direct that their names be displayed at Gram Panchayat Bhavans, block offices, and ward offices,” the bench said, according to ANI.The court instructed the poll body to provide clear guidance for submitting documents and objections, and asked the West Bengal government to ensure adequate manpower for the process. Individuals in the category who have not submitted their claims or objections must do so within 10 days. The bench also directed that authorised officers issue letters to facilitate document submission.The Director General of Police of West Bengal has been asked to ensure smooth conduct and prevent any law-and-order issues.Where objections are found satisfactory, applicants will be given a hearing as per the ECI’s Standard Operating Procedure.Over 1.2 crore names had been flagged under the ‘logical discrepancy’ category on the ERONET portal, sparking controversy.

NEW DELHI: Air India said on Monday it is in the process of returning personal belongings of the AI-171 crash victims, seven months after 260 people were killed in the country’s worst aviation disaster in nearly three decades.According to an Air India spokesperson, 22,000 belongings have been preserved and listed on a dedicated portal. Of these, around 8,000 items could be linked to specific individuals and are listed as “associated,” while the remaining 14,000 are listed as “un-associated.”“Air India is handling this process with utmost respect, dignity, and accuracy. Working closely with a qualified external partner, our teams have spent considerable time cataloguing and documenting recoverable and returnable items,” a spokesperson told news agency PTI.“The exercise began on January 5 and will continue till mid-February. Information has been shared with the families through email and a dedicated website, and once they confirm the details, the belongings will be handed over physically in a manner that honours their grief and privacy. Several families have already collected the items which belonged to their kin,” he added.For “associated” belongings, emails have been sent to the concerned relatives with photographs and details of each recovered item, offering three options: to decline possession, collect it in person from a facilitation centre in Ahmedabad, or have Air India send it via courier.For the remaining 14,000 items, a separate portal has been created. The kin can either collect these in person at Ahmedabad or have them sent by courier, according to their preference.The belongings on display include a toy airplane, a toy car, a wristwatch, plastic bangles, a sweater, a pair of shoes, a half-burnt page of a book containing the famous Gujarati prayer “Mangal Mandir Kholo,” handbags, and other items.On June 12 last year, Air India flight AI-171, a Boeing 787-8 en route to London Gatwick, crashed into a medical college hostel complex shortly after taking off from Ahmedabad’s Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport. The aircraft burst into flames, killing 241 of the 242 people onboard and 19 individuals on the ground.The crash is being probed by the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau.","Air India is in the process of returning personal belongings of AI-171 crash victims. 22,000 belongings have been preserved and listed on a dedicated portal.

However, they cannot afford the high cost of AC tickets for frequent travels.

DHAKA: In the midst of strained relations between New Delhi and Dhaka, the Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh on Monday visited a Teesta project area close to the strategic Siliguri corridor or Chicken’s Neck — a 22-km narrow land strip — between India’s mainland and its Northeastern states.Chinese envoy Yao Wen’s visit was related to an technical assessment being carried out under the Teesta River Comprehensive Management and Restoration Project, said the interim govt headed by Muhammad Yunus whose last year controversial pitch for “extension of the Chinese economy” and India’s “landlocked” Northeast remarks echoed in the Dec anti-India protests that targeted Indian diplomatic facilities in Dhaka and other Bangladeshi cities.Water resources adviser Syeda Rizwana Hasan, who accompanied Yao to the project area in Rangpur’s Tepamadhupur Taluk Shahbazpur, said China is keen to start implementation of Teesta Master Plan (TMP) as soon as possible. She said both Bangladesh and China are committed to implementing TMP. However, as the scrutiny process of project is not yet complete, it is not possible to start work at this time, Hasan said.While for Bangladesh, Teesta is a lifeline for agriculture and livelihoods in its northern districts, for India — West Bengal — its equally critical.Hence, a Teesta water-sharing strategy has stretched over decades and a final agreement has remained elusive due to concerns from West Bengal govt.Following a meeting between Yao and national security adviser Khalilur Rahman Sunday, chief adviser Yunus’s press wing posted on X, “Both sides exchanged views on issues of mutual interest, reaffirming longstanding friendship and development cooperation between Bangladesh and China.”“Discussions included Teesta River Comprehensive Management and Restoration Project and proposed Bangladesh–China Friendship Hospital. In this context, Chinese ambassador informed that he would visit Teesta project area, and reiterated China’s commitment to completing the ongoing technical assessment expeditiously,” it said.The ambassador also reaffirmed his govt’s continued support for Bangladesh’s ongoing democratic transition and conveyed best wishes for the successful conduct of the forthcoming national elections, the press wing said.Yunus, who was appointed chief adviser in 2024, during an interview in China in 2025 had urged Beijing to establish strong economic infrastructure in Bangladesh by leveraging its strategic position as “only guardian of the ocean” in the region.",Chinese envoy Yao Wen’s visit was related to an technical assessment being carried out under the Teesta River Comprehensive Management and Restoration Project.

In the 2025 electoral list, in assembly constituency number 283 (Barabani in Asansol district), a person has been registered as father of 389 voters, Election Commission told Supreme Court on Monday.Such incorrect information is categorised as ‘logical discrepancies’ requiring correction, EC counsel Rakesh Dwivedi told a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justices Dipankar Datta and Joymalya Bagchi. Dwivedi said the notices issued to such voters are for the purpose of correcting the records and the onus is on the voter to produce documents to record the correct name of their parents.In assembly constituency number 169 (Bally, Howrah district), another person is recorded as father of 310 voters, the EC affidavit said. It said each of seven persons are linked to more than 100 voters as parents; 10 have been recorded as parents of 50 or more voters, another ten as father of 40 or more voters, 14 more as father of 30 or more children, 50 for more than 20 children each, 8,682 for more than 10 children each, 2,06,056 for more than six children, and 4,59,054 for more than five children each.It said as per National Family Health Survey 2019-21, the average household size of India is 4.4.“This denotes that on an average each family consists of 2-3 children. However, in some cases the number of electors linked to one parent is more than 50. This required clarification from voters,” Dwivedi said.“Therefore, cases in which six or more electors have mapped/linked themselves to one person, merits greater scrutiny as regards validity of linkages. In such cases, electoral registration officers are issuing notices to verify whether matching has been done correctly to weed out the chance of fraudulent mapping,” EC said.There are four more grounds on which notices have been issued to electors under ‘logical discrepancy’ category: name of elector in the roll as on Oct 27, 2025 not matching with that mentioned in the 2002 SIR roll; difference of elector’s age as per 2025 roll with parent’s (calculated based on 2002 SIR roll) age is less than 15 years; difference of elector’s age (as per 2025 roll) with parent’s age (calculated based on 2002 SIR roll) is more than 50 years; and difference of elector’s age with grandparent’s age is less than 40 years.","There are instances of hundreds of voters who have recorded a single person as their father.

Silver prices surged to a record high on Monday, crossing the Rs 3 lakh-per-kg mark in futures trade for the first time. Gold also rebounded sharply, recovering from last week’s losses.On the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX), silver futures jumped Rs 13,553, or 4.71%, to a record Rs 3,01,315 per kg. Gold futures rose nearly Rs 3,000, or over 2%, to hit a fresh all-time high of Rs 1,45,500 per 10 grams.The rally in precious metals followed renewed geopolitical concerns after US President Donald Trump threatened additional tariffs on several European countries over Greenland.In response, the European Union is preparing retaliatory tariffs worth €93 billion, as reported by ET, citing a Financial Times report. The renewed tensions revived demand for safe-haven assets after easing US-Iran frictions last week had briefly reduced investor interest in gold and silver.Global prices also touched record levels. Spot gold rose 1.7% to $4,673 an ounce, while silver climbed around 3% to about $94 per troy ounce, marking fresh highs in international markets. Silver futures in the overseas market jumped more than 6% to a record $94.35 per ounce.Analysts said that silver has been outperforming gold in recent sessions, supported by strong industrial demand and favourable global trends. Some also pointed to currency movements as an additional factor. The dollar index rose for a third straight week, ending at 99.20, while the USD-INR January 28 futures contract closed higher at 90.8325 on the NSE.Gold, which does not offer interest income, typically benefits when interest rates are low. However, expectations that rate cuts may be delayed have raised the opportunity cost of holding the metal. Despite this, heightened geopolitical risks have continued to support prices.Market participants said precious metals could remain volatile in the near term, with prices driven by developments on the geopolitical front, currency movements and shifts in investor risk appetite.","Silver prices surged to a record high on Monday, crossing the Rs 3 lakh-per-kg mark in futures trade for the first time.

Shares of Bharat Coking Coal Limited (BCCL) made a strong debut on the stock exchanges on Monday, nearly doubling from their issue price after the company’s Rs 1,071 crore initial public offering drew overwhelming investor demand.The stock listed at Rs 45 on the NSE, a premium of 95.6% over the issue price of Rs 23 and at Rs 45.21 on the BSE, marking a gain of 96.6%. Ahead of listing, the company was valued at around Rs 10,711 crore.The IPO, which was open for subscription from January 9 to January 13, was entirely an offer for sale by promoter Coal India Limited and did not involve any fresh capital raise. Proceeds from the issue went to the promoter, while public shareholding increased following the listing.Investor interest in the issue was exceptionally strong, with the IPO subscribed 147 times overall. Demand was high across all categories, led by non-institutional investors, while qualified institutional buyers also oversubscribed their portion multiple times. Retail participation was also strong.Market participants had widely expected a strong listing, supported by high grey market premiums and the company’s strategic role in India’s steel value chain.Analysts said that the debut reflected confidence in Bharat Coking Coal’s dominant position in the domestic coking coal segment.Gaurav Garg, research analyst at Lemon Markets Desk, said the response to the issue highlighted investor belief in the company’s long-term prospects.“The strong response to the Bharat Coking Coal IPO underscores investor confidence in the company’s monopolistic position in India’s coking coal segment and its long-term demand visibility,” he said.Garg added that the anchor book provided early validation, while heavy non-institutional participation signalled expectations of listing gains.Bharat Coking Coal is India’s largest producer of coking coal and the only significant domestic supplier of prime coking coal, a key raw material for steel production.Incorporated in 1972, the company operates 34 mines across the Jharia coalfields in Jharkhand and the Raniganj coalfields in West Bengal, comprising both underground and opencast operations. Its key customers include steel producers and power companies.As of April 2024, the company’s estimated coking coal reserves stood at about 7.91 billion tonnes, accounting for nearly 21.5% of India’s total coking coal resources. In FY25, Bharat Coking Coal produced around 58.5% of the country’s domestic coking coal output.The company has steadily ramped up production in recent years. Coal output increased from 30.5 million tonnes in FY22 to about 40.5 million tonnes in FY25, supported by mine expansions, the reopening of discontinued underground mines and efficiency improvements at coal washeries.On the financial front, Bharat Coking Coal reported revenue of Rs 14,401–14,402 crore and a profit after tax of Rs 1,240 crore in FY25. While earnings have seen some volatility due to fluctuations in coal prices and costs, the company remains debt-free and cash-generative. As of September 2025, it had total assets of Rs 18,711 crore and a net worth of Rs 5,831 crore.Following the listing, Coal India’s shareholding in Bharat Coking Coal has reduced to about 90% from 100%, improving the public float while retaining government control.As a wholly owned subsidiary earlier, BCCL has benefited from Coal India’s technical expertise, financial strength and operational scale.Analysts see the stock as a long-term play linked to India’s infrastructure push and growth in steel demand, though they caution that near-term performance will depend on broader market conditions and trends in coal pricing.“The scarcity value of a pure-play coking coal producer and steady demand from the steel sector support favourable secondary market sentiment,” Garg said. He added that investors should track earnings consistency over time.","Shares of Bharat Coking Coal Limited (BCCL) made a strong debut on the stock exchanges on Monday. The company’s Rs 1,071 crore initial public offering drew overwhelming investor demand. The stock listed at Rs 45 on the NSE, a premium of 95.6% over the issue price of Rs 23.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126670509,imgsize-121210,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

Gold price prediction today:

may continue to scale fresh peaks in the coming days on ongoing geopolitical uncertainty, says Manav Modi, Senior Analyst, Commodity Research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd.

He shares his views and recommendations for gold investors and key levels to watch out for in the near term:

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Gold and Silver prices continue to surge higher marking record highs, as intensifying geopolitical risks and shifting US monetary expectations fuelled strong safe-haven demand through the week. Escalating unrest in Iran, where over 500 people were reportedly killed, renewed US threats of military action and tariffs on countries trading with Iran, and the arrest of Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro injected both short- and long-term uncertainty into global markets, supporting central bank buying and investor inflows into precious metals. With this President Trump has also levied tariffs on major EU nations with a threat to increase the same after June 1st if the deal to buy Greenland does not go through.Gold prices marked a low of around ₹141,000 and reversed sharply from there, as mentioned previously till prices are sustaining above ₹138,000 momentum for prices will remain on higher side. On lower end, immediate support remains at ₹143,000 and ₹140,000.Bollinger bands which were flat have expanded with prices on the higher side showcasing a positive run through expectations. This surge is more convincing as prices are rising along with a surge in volumes showing the buyers strength. The target of ₹145,000 is achieved, however any closing above the same could take the prices higher towards ₹148,000 and ₹152,000 from a medium to long term perspective.Despite a relatively firm dollar, Gold and Silver continued to mark record highs as geopolitical tensions, weak economic data, policy uncertainty, and easing inflation sustained safe-haven appeal. Focus this week will be on US inflation, GDP and speech from President Trump which could keep the volatility along with updates on uncertainties mentioned above.","Gold and Silver prices continue to surge higher marking record highs.

Budget 2026 for taxpayers: Five fixes that can make taxes less taxing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-for-taxpayers-five-fixes-that-can-make-taxes-less-taxing-explained/articleshow/126666769.cms,"The new versus old tax regime choice was meant to empower taxpayers. Instead, it has spawned a parallel paperwork universe.

By Nishant Khemani

One return, one choice

Cut the sting in foreign remittance TCS

NPS withdrawals: clarity needed on taxability

Level the NPS field under the new regime

Time for

joint tax returns

(Nishant Khemani is a chartered accountant and Managing Partner of the Saturn Consulting Group)

Every Union Budget comes with its share of grand announcements, but for ordinary taxpayers, the real test lies in the fine print. As Budget 2026 approaches, expectations are modest yet meaningful: simplify compliance, nudge long-term savings, and stop treating convenience as a luxury. Here are five changes that could make the tax system smarter, softer and more sensible.The new versus old tax regime choice was meant to empower taxpayers. Instead, it has spawned a parallel paperwork universe. Form 10-IE, required to opt in or out of the new regime, is a classic case of procedural overkill. Many taxpayers either forget to file it or file it incorrectly, losing out on the more beneficial regime. The fix is simple: embed the option directly into the ITR. A single return, a clear choice, no extra forms. Ease of doing business should also mean ease of filing taxes, especially for salaried individuals who neither game the system nor enjoy paperwork.A 20% TCS on foreign remittances under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme was introduced to plug tax leakages. The intent is understandable, but the dosage is excessive.For genuine remittances for family support the high TCS blocks liquidity and creates avoidable stress. A more balanced approach would be to reduce TCS to 10%, or introduce a slab system: lower rates up to, say, ₹50 lakh, and higher rates thereafter. Compliance should be encouraged, not coerced.Recent changes to NPS withdrawal rules are a welcome step. Subscribers can now withdraw up to 100% of the corpus if it is within ₹8 lakh, and 80% if it exceeds that limit. This adds flexibility and makes NPS more attractive.But there’s a catch—or rather, a question mark. Till now, only 60% of the corpus was tax-free on maturity. How will the additional 20% be taxed? The Budget should clarify this and remove the ambiguity. Ideally, the extra withdrawal should also be tax-free, reinforcing NPS as a credible retirement pillar rather than a tax puzzle.Under the new tax regime, deductions are scarce, making Section 80CCD(2), the employer contribution to NPS, a rare oasis. However, the additional ₹50,000 deduction under Section 80CCD(1b) is still unavailable in the new regime. Extending this deduction, and enhancing it to ₹1 lakh under the new regime, would send a strong signal. Global evidence is clear: tax incentives drive long-term savings. A stronger NPS today means lower old-age dependency and reduced fiscal pressure tomorrow.India’s tax system still treats married couples as financial strangers. Introducing joint tax returns, with a higher exemption threshold for married couples, would recognise modern household economics—especially double-income families. Such a move would put more disposable income in the hands of families, improve tax equity and align India with global best practices. After all, if households plan together, why shouldn’t they file together?In sum, Budget 2026 doesn’t need fireworks. It needs fine-tuning. Fewer forms, fairer taxes, clearer rules, and smarter incentives could go a long way in making taxation less intimidating—and more humane.","The new versus old tax regime choice was meant to empower taxpayers.

One Nation- One

Income tax

Return (ITR) Form -

Master Circular for New Act –

Tax Deduction at Source (TDS) Reforms -

(Richa Sawhney is Tax Partner, Grant Thornton Bharat LLP CA Sanket Goel contributed to the article. Views of the author are personal)

The Union Budget is just round the corner, and it is that time of the year when Indian taxpayers look at the hon’ble Finance Minister with a lot of anticipation and expectation. While their wishlist will always be long, some of the key items at this juncture are:There are currently 7 ITR forms, which are applicable to different categories of taxpayers. Multiple forms often confuse taxpayers. They create complexity and increase chances of errors. The taxpayers have to figure out the correct ITR form applicable for them for any particular year, basis their sources of income and other parameters applicable for that year. As the sources of income may differ on a year-on-year basis, ITR form may also vary.The government had in the past considered the option of one uniform ITR form for all taxpayers, to make tax filing simpler and user friendly. It is desirable that the same be re-evaluated, more-so, when after the introduction of the New Income-tax Act (New Act) the ITR forms in any case need revision. This single ITR form could have the option to select the entity type of taxpayer and income sources, post that only relevant pre-filled schedules may be visible to the taxpayer. This will further streamline the return filing experience for taxpayers.The New Act would become applicable from 1 April 2026. There are numerous circulars and notifications which have been issued in the past six decades in the context of the Income-tax Act, 1961(old Act).It may be worthwhile to issue a master circular listing all the circulars which are applicable as on 1 April 2026, giving reference of the new sections in the New Act, after removing Circulars relating to the sections which have been deleted in the New Act.This Master Circular may be updated and re-issued on a yearly basis. This would help taxpayers in referring to the correct circulars. It will also be in line with the government’s intent to make income- tax law simple and user friendly.TDS compliances take a lot of time and there is an urgent need to revamp the TDS framework; and it may be possible to do that in a neutral revenue manner. Studies may be conducted to identify TDS sections where collections are high, others with insignificant contributions could either be deleted or merged. Any shortfall would be factored in the consequential advance tax figures. Also, it is desirable that only 2-3 rates are prescribed, so that it becomes easier for taxpayers to comply.Further, the requirement to issue TDS certificates should be removed. This information is already available in form 26AS and Annual Information Statement (AIS). TDS Ledger mechanism may be considered to avoid litigation on matching income with TDS. These measures put together, will go a long way in reducing compliance burden on taxpayers and mitigating litigation on interpretation issues.Tax as a tool to tackle air pollution in Indian cities – Many Indian cities continue to regularly appear in the world's most polluted cities list. In the recent past many countries have also issued travel advisories for India highlighting the pollution concerns. Considering the magnitude of the problem, a multi pronged approach is required to address this challenge. Using direct tax law as an enabler by giving a special tax incentive for purchase of Electric Vehicles (EVs) may be considered in the new individual tax regime.While the policy of the government has been to move to lower taxes with lesser deductions and exemptions, an exception may be carved out for this incentive due to health emergency the country faces on account of air pollution. Taxpayers could also be encouraged to earmark some proportion of CSR spend for supporting research in pollution control measures and supporting government approved pollution control schemes/drives in the cities in which they operate. This spend should be specifically permitted to be treated as tax deductible expenditure. While these measures on a stand-alone basis may not resolve the issue, they could help support the overall efforts needed at the government level to tackle the situation.To conclude, while some of these expectations are in sync with the government’s stated intent of simplifying and streamlining the taxation regime in India, others depict a wishlist based on the need being felt by masses in India to tackle the health hazard being felt by all of us. Taxpayers hope that the government considers them favourably in the upcoming budget.","The Union Budget is just round the corner, and it is that time of the year when Indian taxpayers look at the hon’ble Finance Minister with a lot of anticipation and expectation.

India has a river that flows backwards: Know which river it is,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/travel/india-has-a-river-that-flows-backwards-know-which-river-it-is/articleshow/126525975.cms,"The Narmada river flows in the opposite direction and here’s why

The origin of the Narmada River

The reason why the Narmada flow westwards

What landscapes does the river support

Dams and projects that lie on the river

Natural sites found along the Narmada

Narmada and its importance for faith and culture





India’s river systems are usually described as following a clear pattern. Most major rivers rise in the Himalayas or the central highlands and travel eastward to the Bay of Bengal, a rule taught early in geography lessons and seldom challenged. Yet one notable river defies this logic. Flowing westward across the subcontinent, it reshapes landscapes, livelihoods, and belief systems along its course. Far from obscure or insignificant, this river is long, deeply revered, and extensively studied, though its direction often surprises first-time learners. The Narmada stands apart not for its size or speed alone, but because its westward journey is dictated by geology rather than convention.The river that flows west instead of east is the Narmada. Extending roughly 1,310 kilometres, it is the fifth-longest river in India. Unlike major rivers such as the Ganga or the Godavari, the Narmada does not flow into the Bay of Bengal. From its point of origin, it maintains a steady westward path before eventually emptying into the Arabian Sea. Only a handful of major Indian rivers follow this course, with the Tapi being another prominent example.The idea that the Narmada flows “backwards” exists simply because most rivers in the region move in the opposite, eastward direction.The Narmada River begins near Amarkantak, Madhya Pradesh. The location is forested and serves as a pilgrimage site. From here, the river begins to move westward. It runs across Madhya Pradesh, briefly crosses Maharashtra, and finally enters Gujarat. Its trip ends near Bharuch, where it enters the Arabian Sea. The river's character alters as it travels. In some areas, it cuts through hills and small valleys, but in others, it spreads out and slows. The upper stretches feel isolated, whereas the lower ones feel settled.Geology shapes the Narmada's flow direction. It flows across a rift valley caused by previous tectonic action. The valley slopes east to west. Water follows the slope. The Vindhya Range sits to the north of the basin, while the Satpura Range extends to the south. Because the river passes through this gap, it behaves differently than many others. It does not form a wide delta. Instead, it creates an estuary where it joins the sea.The Narmada basin covers varied terrain. The upper areas are hilly and forested, with fewer people living nearby. Further west, the land becomes flatter and more open. These plains are fertile. Farming depends heavily on the river here. Crops such as wheat, pulses, and cotton are common. The river also supplies drinking water. Over time, canals and reservoirs have extended its reach. Towns and cities along the river rely on it in quiet, everyday ways.Several large dams have been built along the Narmada. The Sardar Sarovar Dam in Gujarat is the most widely known. Others include the Indira Sagar Dam and the Omkareshwar Dam in Madhya Pradesh. These projects generate electricity and supply water for farming and households. They have also changed how the river flows. Over the years, they have been linked to debates about land, displacement, and environmental impact. These discussions continue.The river is also associated with well known natural features. Near Jabalpur, it passes between tall marble cliffs known as the Marble Rocks. Close by, the Dhuandhar Falls send water crashing down in a thick spray, especially during the monsoon. These places are not vast, but they leave an impression. The river here feels contained. The sound carries. The landscape holds it in place.For numerous individuals, the Narmada signifies more than merely a river. Temples in Maheshwar, Omkareshwar, and Amarkantak attract pilgrims year-round. Some individuals undertake the Narmada Parikrama, an extensive pilgrimage along its banks. The river is regarded as a living entity. Its trajectory has remained consistent across generations. Throughout its extent, faith, establishment, and customary practices persist in expanding around it.","The Narmada River is the fifth-longest river in India.

Merge Labs vs Neuralink





ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has announced an investment in Merge Labs, a brain-computer interface (BCI) startup which was founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Rival to Elon Musk ’s Neuralink, the mission of Merge Labs is to develop safe and scaleable brain-computer interfaces. “We are excited to support and collaborate with Merge Labs as they turn an ambitious idea into reality and ultimately products that are useful for people,” said the company.OpenAI revealed that funding made by the company will support Merge Labs’ mission of creating safe, scalable brain-computer interfaces that could one day allow humans to interact with artificial intelligence directly through neural signals. The company has not yet disclosed the size of the investment, but the partnership underscores OpenAI’s growing interest in technologies that extend beyond software into hardware and human augmentation.Merge Labs is a research lab with the long-term mission of bridging biological and artificial intelligence to maximize human ability, agency, and experience. It is developing fundamentally new approaches⁠ (opens in a new window) to BCIs that are safe and interface with the brain at much higher bandwidth by combining biology, devices, and AI.The company is focused on creating non-invasive neural interfaces that can translate brain activity into digital commands. Unlike more invasive approaches that require surgical implants, Merge Labs aims to build consumer-ready devices that are both accessible and ethically designed.The company’s early prototypes reportedly use advanced sensors and machine learning models to interpret neural signals, with potential applications ranging from medical rehabilitation to enhanced productivity tools.Elon Musk founded Neuralink in 2016 and till now the company has made significant progress in developing brain implants which enable people with paralysis to control devices with the help of their thoughts. The Elon Musk-owned company recently raised $600 million at a $9 billion valuation and is conducting human trials.Merge Labs on the other hand, is reportedly working on less invasive brain interfaces with a strong emphasis on AI-powered enhancements. The focus of the startup is not just medical rehabilitation but broader human-AI integration.“I believe the merge has already started,” Altman wrote in a 2017 blog post. “We will be the first species ever to design our own descendants”.","Merge Labs is a brain-computer interface (BCI) startup founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.

MrBeast’s 'Beast Industries' hits $5 billion valuation, but personal liquidity tells a different story



MrBeast’s Forbes net worth vs. personal cash



MrBeast: “I actually have negative money”



Focus on reinvesting, not personal savings



High-cost decisions driven by time constraints



MrBeast borrowed money for his wedding



Multiple ventures under the MrBeast brand







Jimmy Donaldson, widely known as MrBeast, is one of the most well-known people on YouTube. He runs a business and content empire that reaches hundreds of millions of people around the world, and he's only 27. His videos often have big challenges, giving back, and record-breaking prize money. People often think that MrBeast is personally wealthy in the traditional sense, with lots of money on hand, because of how he looks to the public. But a recent interview has brought a different side of his financial situation to light. Donaldson was honest about money and said that even though the company he started is worth billions, his own bank account tells a very different story. He said he has ""negative money"" and is currently borrowing money, even for big life events. His comments have brought attention to the differences between startup valuations, equity ownership, and personal liquidity, especially for founders who keep putting money into growth. The conversation gives us a better idea of how digital businesses work today and how money is often tied up on paper instead of cash.Beast Industries, MrBeast's main business, is at the heart of what he does.As per a report from Fortune in September 2025, the company is now worth $5 billion. Donaldson owns a little more than half of the company, which gives him a big stake in it. Beast Industries runs a number of businesses, such as making big YouTube videos, creating branded content, and making consumer goods. The value takes into account the company's reach, potential for revenue, and high levels of audience engagement across platforms.But the value of a company is not the same as the cash it has on hand. A valuation is what investors think the business is worth based on how much money it will make and how fast it will grow in the future. It is not the amount of money the founder has to spend every day.Forbes said that MrBeast's net worth was $85 million in June 2025. This number includes the estimated worth of his stake in Beast Industries, other business ventures, personal investments, and additional things he owns. Donaldson has made it clear that most of this net worth is tied up in stocks and company equity rather than readily available cash.He talked about common misconceptions and ideas about his wealth in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. He said that a lot of people incorrectly assume he is a billionaire, but that is because they often mix up his net worth with his liquid, spendable cash. He explained that it is not easy to use equity in a company for everyday expenses unless it is sold, converted, or leveraged, which he has deliberately chosen not to do to maintain long-term control.Donaldson said something very interesting about his finances during the interview. He said, ""I really... I have negative money right now."" I am borrowing money. He also said that if you take away the equity value of his company, many viewers would technically have more money in their bank accounts than he does.He gave a simple example to explain the situation, saying that company equity can't be used to buy a McDonald’s meal in the morning. This comment made it clear that there is a difference between wealth on paper and money you can actually spend.Donaldson said that his focus on work and growth affects how he handles his money. He said he doesn't think about his bank balance very often. Instead, he is focused on making videos and growing his businesses.He has said many times that a lot of the money he makes goes back into making more content. He says that spending on making content alone is expected to reach about $250 million in one year. This model of reinvesting in productions allows for more complicated works, bigger prizes, and higher production standards, which are now a defining feature of his brand.Donaldson has made some expensive spending choices when he needed to, even though he keeps a small personal account. He told one story about how he rented a private jet to see his fiancée, Thea Booysen, who was studying in the UK at the time.He said that because of where he lived and when he worked, commercial travel took a lot of time. It took a long drive and a lot of layovers to get to a big airport. Donaldson says that a private jet cut down on travel time a lot, which meant he could keep working without losing almost a whole day to travel. The flight is said to have cost about $150,000.Donaldson told people on social media in June 2025 that he had borrowed money from his mother to help pay for his wedding. He said that this happened because he put most of his money back into his businesses.He also pointed out how ironic it was that he owned companies worth billions of dollars but still needed short-term personal loans. He said again that even though the businesses look very valuable on paper, that value doesn't always turn into cash that you can use for yourself.Donaldson's business portfolio includes several big projects, not just YouTube videos. One of them is ""Beast Games,"" a competition series that gave its first-season winner $10 million, which is one of the biggest single prizes in entertainment history. Feastables is another important business. It's a consumer brand that focuses on chocolate and snack foods, and it has grown quickly in retail markets.All of these projects need a lot of money up front. Donaldson's strategy of reinvesting rather than taking personal income is supported by high operating costs, which come from prize money, production costs, staffing, and logistics.","Jimmy Donaldson, widely known as MrBeast, is one of the most well-known people on YouTube.

KEONJHAR/ BHUBANESWAR: Six armed men stormed the Barbil branch of a public sector bank in Keonjhar district on Monday afternoon, held staff and customers hostage at gunpoint, before decamping with gold worth nearly Rs 5 crore and Rs 8 lakh in cash.The brazen heist took place around 2 pm, when five customers and 10 staff members were inside the branch.The masked assailants - suspected to be from Jharkhand - brandishing pistols, shut the main door and seized mobile phones from everyone and confined them to a room before targeting the bank's safe deposit lockers.Keonjhar SP Nitin Kusalkar, who went to the spot along with his team, said the exact value of the stolen assets is being verified.""According to the bank's claim, 4-5 kg of gold linked to gold loan accounts, valued at Rs 4-5 crore, was looted. Multiple teams have been formed to track the culprits. CCTV footage from the bank and nearby areas is under examination. Given Barbil's proximity to the Jharkhand border, we suspect the gang may have come from there,"" Kusalkar told TOI.Sources revealed the operation lasted barely 15 minutes. Local residents and neighbouring shopkeepers did not even get a whiff of the incident.The robbers fled on five motorcycles, leaving locals to discover the crime only after they had left.Police authorities confirmed that the branch had no security guard at the time of the incident. ""We have repeatedly advised banks in the district, including this one, to install advanced CCTV cameras, alarm systems and deploy guards. Unfortunately, this branch ignored our safety advisory,"" Kusalkar added.Though no injury was reported, the incident has triggered panic among residents.Police have sounded a high alert, setting up blockades across Keonjhar and monitoring possible escape routes. Witnesses said the robbers conversed in both Hindi and Odia during the loot. Recounting the ordeal, bank manager P K Burnwal said, ""They threatened to shoot if we didn't open the lockers.Cash and packets of gold were taken."" On being asked about the absence of security personnel, Burnwal said, ""Our bank does not have the provision of a guard at the branch. But our CCTV surveillance system is functional.""","Six armed men stormed the Barbil branch of a public sector bank in Keonjhar district on Monday afternoon.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Increased bellyhold space helps exporters and SMEs move goods faster and more frequently. Stronger Bilateral Ties: Reinforces UAE–Philippines economic and tourism cooperation under CEPA.





In a major boost for travel and trade between the UAE and the Philippines, Emirates Airline has announced it will add four additional weekly flights between Dubai and Manila starting April 2, 2026. The increase, a key part of Emirates’ Southeast Asia expansion strategy, will take the total weekly flights on this popular long-haul route from 28 to 34 services per week.The new flights will be scheduled for Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays and will be operated by Emirates’ wide-body Boeing 777-300ER aircraft, featuring premium cabins with First Class private suites, 42 lie-flat Business seats and 304 Economy seats. Passengers will benefit from expanded travel options, improved schedule flexibility and additional connections via Dubai to destinations across North America, Europe and the Middle East.The additional weekly frequencies underscore Emirates’ confidence in the Dubai–Manila air corridor, which serves not only holidaymakers and business travellers but also one of the world’s largest expatriate communities.The move comes as demand for international air travel rebounds strongly, particularly between the UAE and Southeast Asia, with Manila emerging as a key hub for leisure and corporate travel alike.The new flights will depart Dubai at 12:45 pm, arriving in Manila early the next morning, and return from Manila at 3:25 am, landing in Dubai at 8:25 am local time. The expanded schedule is designed to make long-haul itineraries more seamless, especially for travellers heading onward from Manila to major cities in Canada, the United States and Europe with improved connection spreads.Beyond passengers, the airline’s four added flights will significantly boost cargo capacity, with each Boeing 777 able to carry up to 20 tonnes of freight in the bellyhold even at full passenger load. This extra capacity is expected to strengthen imports and exports between the Philippines and global markets, particularly for industries like electronics, agricultural goods and e-commerce, by offering shippers more frequent and reliable bellyhold options.This logistics expansion aligns with broader economic cooperation between the UAE and the Philippines, which recently advanced their ties through a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) aimed at deepening trade, investment and mobility.For the large Filipino diaspora in the UAE, Europe and North America, the additional flights mean more flexibility and convenience when visiting families back home. Corporate travellers and seafarers are also likely to benefit from better timing options and more competitive pricing, particularly during peak periods of travel.Beginning in 1990, Emirates’ expanded schedule builds on its three-decade presence in the Philippines and complements its partnerships with Philippine Airlines to extend access to domestic destinations like Cebu, Clark and other regional points via seamless connections.Emirates travellers can book the new flights through the airline’s website, app, travel agents or Emirates retail locations ahead of the April launch.","Emirates Airline has announced it will add four additional weekly flights between Dubai and Manila starting April 2, 2026.

'Staying outside US for too long': Immigration lawyer flags 10 Green Card mistakes one should avoid,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/staying-outside-us-for-too-long-immigration-lawyer-flags-10-green-card-mistakes-one-should-avoid/articleshow/126708497.cms,"1. Staying outside the US too long

2. Not having enough ties to the US

3. Getting convicted

4. Failing to pay taxes

5. Making a false claim to the USCIS

6. Failing to file Form I-751 if you have a conditional Green Card through marriage

7. Suspicion of a fake marriage

8. Misrepresentation to immigration officials

9. Notify USCIS within 10 days every time you move

10. Voluntary abandonment





A Green Card is no longer a guarantee to stay in the US permanently, the Donald Trump administration has made it clear, as it arrested Green Card holder activists, deported them flagging them as national security risks. Nationals of 75 countries will not get Green Cards now, the administration announced as it examines how much welfare benefits they are taking. Immigration attorney Moumita Rahman, in a recent YouTube video, discussed how people unintentionally put themselves at risks by doing these 10 mistakes:A Green Card holder is allowed to travel and work abroad but these trips, if they are longer than six months, can be used to prove that an individual has abandoned his or her residency. It is advised to spend at least 9-10 months in the USNot having enough ties to the US can put an individual at risk of losing his or her Green Card. But a real, fixed address, US bank account, US credit card, filing tax, and having a job, having other family members, school-aged children can solve this situationThe attorney explained that this is not about getting a speeding ticket or a parking ticket but serious offences like fraud, theft, shoplifting, domestic abuse, causing physical harm to anyone etc.USCIS is checking tax compliance more than ever. Green Card holders should unfailingly fill Form 1040 to report their income to the Internal Revenue Service to inform the government how much you earned, how much tax you owe or how much refund you should get.Even if the false claim happens by mistake, this is an unredeemable and Green Card will get revoked if you claim yourself as a US citizen on any form, if you register to vote or actually vote or try to get US passport.90 days before your conditional Green Card expires, you have to file Form I-751, not earlier and not after expiry. This form converts your conditional Green Card into a permanent Green Card but if you fail to file within the stipulated time, you lose your Green Card and get deported.Even real couples can trigger the suspicion of a fake, paid marriage if they do not have a shared life.This does not have to be big lies but deliberate suppression of facts to immigration officials can cost yout Green Card. If you hide a previous deportation or removal order, leave out past immigration violations, lie bout employment history, you are at the risk of losing your Green Card.Every time you change your address, Green Card holders must inform the USCIS by submitting Form AR11.Submitting Form I-407 means formally giving up a Green Card, but one should submit it only when the intention is to abandon residency and not just evading tax as signing this form would mean you surrendered your Green Card.","A Green Card is no longer a guarantee to stay in the US permanently, the Donald Trump administration has made it clear.

'Annoyed with sanitation': How missing garbage bins triggered NYC’s strangest urban crisis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/annoyed-with-sanitation-how-missing-garbage-bins-triggered-nycs-strangest-urban-crisis/articleshow/126706247.cms,"Trash talk: No bins in stock



No bin in NYC?







Who thought a bunch of garbage cans would have New Yorkers rushing to stores and dialling up authorities? But, it seems the administration can make them do it all.As a part of an anti-rat push by the City Hall, New Yorkers were told they had to start using official NYC garbage cans for trash pickup. As per the mandate, every building with one to nine units would have to use the official ""NYC Bin"" when they put out their trash by this summer or else face a fine.However, the residents are facing tough luck finding the bins for purchase as the city government blames an outside vendor for the issues. “Online ordering and the call centre are currently unavailable. Select NYC Bins are available at all NYC Home Depot locations,” states the Sanitation Department website.In a conversation with The Post, a Brooklynite revealed that the bins were out of stock at Home Depot. “How can we not find a consistent supply of these cans without using a Home Depot and an out-of-state manufacturer who can’t even supply them?” they said.Another, ordered a bin back in October 2025, which never arrived. And when they contacted the Department of Sanitation, the phone lines were down and the website proved to be useless.“I sort of got a little tired, and I felt like, to tell the truth, I’m really annoyed with sanitation,” said the 76-year-old Michael Monopoli to the outlet. “I never got the pail. And when I went to call you, the Department of Sanitation, you close down your phone and your website. So how am I supposed to get a ticket from you?”As per the city, the vendor that makes the bins is ""failing to fulfil some orders"" and people should email the manufacturer, Otto Environmental Systems, for refunds. However, the company also advised people to go to Home Depot to purchase the bins. “We are committed to restoring home delivery as quickly as possible to ensure the success of this important program,” a spokesperson for Otto Environmental Systems said.People are frustrated to see an idea that is normal in numerous cities, fail in execution in NYC. “It seems like only in New York can you try to match a standard idea from across the country and struggle so much to accomplish it,” they said.Others have noticed that sanitation workers themselves have been struggling to work with the bins. “It has a latch. They have to drag it over to the truck, flip it up, and then take the bags, throw them out, and then they have to just throw it back where it went and then move on,” they shared. “Before they had a flow. They just grabbed the bags from the curb, tossed them and kept going. It’s like a whole extra step. It’s a lot.”The idea was proposed by former NYC mayor Eric Adams amid his ""War on Rats."" However, it was the City Council that passed legislation to reimburse middle-class homeowners for the approximately $50 bins.While New Yorkers set out their trash in any 55-gallon lidded bin as of now, by June they need to have the NYC-branded bins, or else be fined $50.","New Yorkers were told they had to start using official NYC garbage cans for trash pickup.

Proximity to Siachen and Ladakh



The valley lies close to the Siachen Glacier, where Indian and Pakistani troops have been locked in a military standoff for decades. Chinese activity in the area adds a third actor to an already volatile theatre. China-Pakistan strategic depth



The region provides China and Pakistan with contiguous territorial access, enabling coordination between Xinjiang and Gilgit-Baltistan. This was impossible before the 1963 agreement. Military and logistics implications



Infrastructure in the Shaksgam Valley improves China’s ability to move troops, equipment and supplies near India’s northern frontiers, particularly Ladakh. Precedent for territorial claims



For India, accepting Chinese control over Shaksgam would weaken its legal position on PoK as a whole and dilute the 1994 parliamentary resolution asserting that the entire region belongs to India.

What has MEA said?

What China said?

What is the China-Pakistan boundary agreement of 1963?

Why does India call the 1963 agreement illegal?

Pakistan is an occupying power: New Delhi holds that Pakistan’s control over parts of Jammu and Kashmir is illegal, making any territorial transfer invalid.

Violation of India’s sovereignty: Any alteration of borders in Jammu and Kashmir without India’s consent infringes upon its territorial integrity.

Dangerous precedent: Accepting the agreement would legitimise third-party involvement in the Kashmir dispute. This legal position has remained unchanged across governments and decades.

What is CPEC and how does it link to Shaksgam Valley?

Why is China pushing infrastructure in this area now?

Securing Xinjiang’s western approache

Protecting CPEC assets amid militant threats in Pakistan

Signalling resolve after standoffs in eastern Ladakh

Reinforce claims through physical presence

Infrastructure, in this sense, becomes both a logistical asset and a political statement.

Where does Pakistan stand?

What happens next?





NEW DELHI: China’s fresh assertion that the Shaksgam Valley “belongs to China” has reopened a largely forgotten but strategically explosive fault line in the long-running Kashmir dispute. Beijing’s defence of infrastructure construction in the region -- tied closely to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) -- has drawn a sharp response from New Delhi, which has once again described the area as an “integral and inalienable part of India”.The disagreement is not merely semantic. At stake are territorial sovereignty, India’s claims over Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), China’s growing footprint in the western Himalayas, and the future shape of regional connectivity linking Xinjiang, Gilgit-Baltistan and the Arabian Sea.This explainer breaks down what the Shaksgam Valley is, why it matters, the legal roots of the dispute, what India and China have said, and how CPEC and the 1963 China-Pakistan boundary agreement fit into the larger geopolitical picture.The Shaksgam Valley -- also known as the Trans-Karakoram Tract -- is a sparsely populated, high-altitude region located north of the Siachen Glacier . It borders China’s Xinjiang province to the north, Pakistan-occupied Gilgit-Baltistan to the south and west, and the Siachen area to the east.Geographically inhospitable, the region is marked by glaciers, mountain passes and extreme weather. Politically, however, it is one of the most sensitive pieces of territory in the Kashmir puzzle.India maintains that the Shaksgam Valley is part of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir and therefore legally belongs to India. Pakistan , which has occupied parts of Jammu and Kashmir since 1947, transferred control of the area to China in 1963 — a move New Delhi has never recognised.China currently administers the territory as part of Xinjiang and treats it as sovereign Chinese land.At its core, the dispute revolves around who has the legal authority to decide the fate of the Shaksgam Valley.India’s position is straightforward: Pakistan had no legal right to cede any part of Jammu and Kashmir to a third country because it is an occupying power in PoK. Any agreement signed by Pakistan concerning that territory is therefore “illegal and invalid”.China and Pakistan argue otherwise. They say the 1963 China-Pakistan boundary agreement was a sovereign decision between two independent states to demarcate their frontier and bring stability to a previously undefined border.Beijing has now gone a step further by asserting that infrastructure development in the region is “fully justified”, signalling that it considers the issue closed — at least from its perspective.Despite its harsh terrain, the Shaksgam Valley holds outsized strategic importance for four key reasons:India’s response has been unusually firm and consistent. Ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal has categorically rejected both China’s claims and Pakistan’s role in facilitating them.“Shaksgam Valley is an Indian territory. We have never recognised the so-called China-Pakistan boundary agreement of 1963,” Jaiswal said during a weekly briefing.He added that India also does not recognise the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which passes through territory “under forcible and illegal occupation of Pakistan”.Jaiswal underlined that the entire Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are an integral and inalienable part of India, and said New Delhi has consistently protested attempts to alter the ground reality in the Shaksgam Valley.Importantly, India has also reserved the right to take necessary measures to safeguard its interests, language that signals both diplomatic and strategic options remain open.China’s response has been equally direct.Beijing's foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning rejected India’s objections, stating: “The territory you mentioned belongs to China. It’s fully justified for China to conduct infrastructure construction on its own territory.”She said China and Pakistan had signed a boundary agreement in the 1960s and demarcated their border as an exercise of sovereign rights.On India’s criticism of CPEC, Mao repeated Beijing’s long-standing line that the project is an economic cooperation initiative aimed at development and improving livelihoods.Crucially, she added that the boundary agreement and CPEC do not affect China’s position on the Kashmir issue, which Beijing says should be resolved peacefully in accordance with UN resolutions and bilateral agreements.Signed on March 2, 1963, the China-Pakistan boundary agreement formally transferred 5,180 square kilometres of territory in the Shaksgam Valley from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir to China.At the time, Pakistan described the move as a provisional arrangement, pending the final settlement of the Kashmir dispute. The agreement includes a clause stating that once Kashmir is resolved, the sovereign authority would renegotiate the boundary with China.India rejected the agreement outright, arguing that Pakistan had no locus standi to sign away territory that legally belonged to India.For China and Pakistan, however, the agreement served a vital purpose: it created a shared land border, laying the foundation for their enduring strategic partnership.India’s objections rest on three pillars:The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is a Beijing's flagship Belt and Road Initiative project valued at around $60 billion. It links China’s Xinjiang region to Pakistan’s Gwadar port through roads, railways, energy projects and industrial zones.Parts of CPEC pass through Gilgit-Baltistan, which is a part of PoK.While Shaksgam Valley is not the most visible segment of CPEC, its integration into Chinese logistics networks strengthens Beijing’s western connectivity and supports Pakistan’s role as China’s gateway to the Arabian Sea.India argues that CPEC directly infringes on its sovereignty, and has repeatedly warned against third-country participation in projects passing through PoK.Several factors appear to be driving Beijing’s assertiveness:Pakistan has backed China’s position, insisting that the 1963 agreement is valid and that CPEC is critical to its economic future.Islamabad recently announced the creation of a Special Protection Unit to safeguard Chinese nationals working on CPEC projects, underscoring how central the corridor has become to Pakistan-China ties.India, however, continues to describe Pakistan’s actions as illegal and accuses Islamabad of trading away territory that does not belong to it.In the short term, the dispute is likely to play out diplomatically, with India continuing to lodge protests and China proceeding with its projects.In the longer term, the Shaksgam Valley could emerge as another pressure point in the already strained India-China relationship, especially if infrastructure development alters the strategic balance near Ladakh and Siachen.For New Delhi, the challenge lies in defending its territorial claims without triggering escalation, while preventing the gradual normalisation of a situation it considers unlawful.The Shaksgam Valley may be remote and uninhabited, but it sits at the crossroads of India-China rivalry, Pakistan’s territorial gambits, and China’s westward expansion.China’s renewed claim and India’s firm rejection show that the issue is far from settled. What was once a quiet footnote to the Kashmir dispute is now re-emerging as a live geopolitical fault line — one that could shape the strategic landscape of the Himalayas for years to come.","The Shaksgam Valley is a sparsely populated, high-altitude region.

JeM chief: Have thousands of suicide bombers ready to go,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/jem-chief-have-thousands-of-suicide-bombers-ready-to-go/articleshow/126470891.cms,".

‘Not 1, Not 1,000’: Jem Chief Masood Azhar Returns With Audio Threat As India Tightens Terror Noose

Def experts: Azhar’s statement sign of post-Sindoor frustration





A new audio recording purportedly featuring Maulana Masood Azhar , the elusive chief of terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), has surfaced on social media, boasting that his organisation now commands ""thousands"" of suicide bombers who are prepared for immediate deployment.The clip has surfaced at a time when Pahalgam attack mastermind and Lashkar-e-Taiba deputy chief Saifullah Kasuri was captured on video claiming that the Pakistani army had invited him to lead the funeral prayers of its soldiers after Operation Sindoor - conducted by India in May last year following the terror attack in J&K. Both clips were posted on Telegram and X by pro-ISI accounts.The messages are being viewed as a desperate propaganda attempt to revitalize a group reeling from devastating losses inflicted by the Indian armed forces during the operation. Kasoori's speech was made from a school with hundreds of children visible in the audience while Azhar too is seemingly addressing a public gathering, sources said.In another video, Kasuri has also welcomed the growing diplomatic and military ties between Pakistan and Bangladesh. The latest recording features a defiant Azhar claiming that the sheer number of his followers would ""cause an uproar in the global media"" if fully revealed.Azhar said new recruits are driven by the obsession of attaining ""martyrdom"".Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) Masood Azhar asserts that these recruits are driven by a fanatical obsession with “martyrdom”, explicitly stating that they do not seek material comforts like cars, motorcycles or foreign visas. “They only ask Allah for one thing: martyrdom,” the UN-designated terrorist claimed, attempting to project a picture of high morale and spiritual conviction among his cadre.However, defence experts suggested this was little more than a “hollow threat” and a sign of severe frustration arising out of Operation Sindoor, a series of precision strikes by India in May 2025 that decimated JeM’s infrastructure and eliminated at least 10 of Azhar’s close relatives and top aides in Bahawalpur.“This audio appears to be a calculated effort to save face after the group’s leadership was ‘torn to pieces’, as recently admitted by other JeM commanders,” said a source. Interestingly, Azhar has not been seen in public since a 2019 blast at his Bahawalpur hideout, leading to persistent rumours about his health and location.This latest audio, while lacking visual proof of his life, indicates that the terror mastermind is still attempting to operate from the shadows, deep within a safe haven in Pakistan. Security agencies are now closely analysing voice samples and metadata of the clip to track its origin and assess the current threat level posed by the group’s surviving sleeper cells, sources said.","New audio recording purportedly featuring Maulana Masood Azhar has surfaced on social media.
