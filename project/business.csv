'Resilient Despite Attempts To Crush It': PM Modi Praises RSS' Unbroken Spirit And Service

Illegal immigration threat to India’s demography: PM

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Wednesday praised the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ’s campaign against caste discrimination and untouchability, highlighting RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat ’s call for shared temples, wells and cremation grounds.“The Sangh has continuously fought against untouchability and social discrimination. Mahatma Gandhi also openly praised the Sangh’s equality and fraternity,” said Modi while speaking at an event to commemorate Sangh’s centenary celebrations.In his speech marked by a tough pitch against infiltration, Modi emphasised that successive RSS chiefs have campaigned against caste discrimination. “Na Hindu patito bhavet (No Hindu can ever be fallen),” he quoted the second Sarsanghchalak as saying.Modi also cited the third Sarsanghchalak’s statement, “If Hindu untouchability is not wrong, nothing else is wrong in the world”, and referred to Bhagwat’s statement that no Hindu can be barred from accessing temples, wells and cremation grounds used by others.Modi said these ideals represented the Sangh’s effort to eliminate internal divisions and strengthen national unity. “No discrimination, no differences of opinion, no alienation of hearts — this is the basis of harmony,” he added.The reference to RSS’s stand against untouchability is significant in view of efforts of its ideological opponents to frame the organisation as a Brahmanical outfit. He also sought to rebut the allegation about Sangh’s aloofness from the freedom struggle by saying that its founder KB Hedgewar was jailed several times by the British authorities, while its workers supported and provided protection to freedom fighters.The PM doubled down on his stand against infiltration and warned that illegal immigration posed a grave threat to India’s demography and internal security. He also tied the Sangh’s message of social equality to the broader challenges facing India and underlined that the RSS’s social reform initiatives were inseparable from its nationalist credentials, pointing to the participation of its early leaders and volunteers in the freedom struggle.Many RSS workers faced British repression during the 1942 Quit India upsurge and the Chimur agitation, he said. “From the fight against the Nizam’s oppression in Hyderabad to the liberation of Goa, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, the Sangh made many sacrifices,” Modi said, situating the organisation within the broader sweep of India’s anti-colonial and post-Independence struggles.",PM Narendra Modi on Wednesday praised the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh’s campaign against caste discrimination and untouchability.

Better & safer

NEW DELHI: Aimed at eliminating men, vehicle and animal conflict in Kaziranga National Park (KNP), the Cabinet Wednesday approved widening and improvement of 86-km Kalibor-Numaligarh section of NH-715 in Assam, including three elevated sections of 34.5 km through the national park.The Rs 6,957 crore project will be fully funded by govt. Once the elevated section is built, the existing two-lane highway passing through the KNP will be abandoned. The existing road will be part of the national park, thereby ensuring unhindered movement of animals.Sharing the Cabinet decision with reporters, I&B minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said the project will decongest the existing corridor, improve safety, and necessary provisions have been made in consultation with entities, including National Tiger Conservation Authority and Wildlife Institute of India to prevent any harm to animals.Terming it as a historic decision for Assam and the northeast in a post on X, PM Modi said, “The Cabinet decision on widening and upgradation of the Kalibor–Numaligarh section of NH-715, including an elevated corridor with wildlife-friendly measures in the Kaziranga stretch, will boost development as well as ensure animal safety. Tourism to Kaziranga will receive a big boost.”Sources said the plan to expand the road and building elevated stretch had been in works since 2016, but it gained momentum after NHAI took up the stretch in 2023.Govt said a major part of the existing highway passes either through the national park or along the southern boundary of the park having only 16 to 32 metres of right of way. “During monsoons, the area inside the park gets flooded leading to the movement of the wildlife from the park towards the elevated Karbi-Anglong Hills by crossing the existing highway. The heavy round-the-clock traffic on the highway results in frequent accidents and deaths of wild animals,” it added.","The Rs 6,957 crore project will be fully funded by govt.

NEW DELHI: India has not invited Pakistan and China to a conclave of Army chiefs of UN troop-contributing nations here from October 14 to 16, even as officials reiterated New Delhi’s policy of not deploying troops to foreign conflict zones like Ukraine or Gaza unless explicitly mandated by the UNSC and under the UN flag.Army deputy chief (IS&T) Lt-Gen Rakesh Kapoor said the meet, with senior military leaders from over 30 nations, will foster cooperation and “a stable international order.”Asked about possible deployments, defence ministry joint secy Vishwesh Negi said such a move is “unlikely” given UNSC dynamics. Kapoor added, “India deploys troops overseas only under UN flag.”India has been one of the largest contributors of troops for UN peacekeeping operations around the world since 1950s. “In 75 years, India has contributed over 2.9 lakh peacekeepers spread across 50 UN missions...182 peacekeepers have made the supreme sacrifice,” Lt-Gen Kapoor said.",India has not invited Pakistan and China to a conclave of Army chiefs of UN troop-contributing nations.

'Resilient Despite Attempts To Crush It': PM Modi Praises RSS' Unbroken Spirit And Service

NEW DELHI: Congress said the party and other ideological groups fought for the freedom struggle, while RSS sided with the British, as it slammed PM Narendra Modi ’s claim at a function on Wednesday.Congress posted on social media a video of party president Mallikarjun Kharge asking, “tell us how many of your people (RSS) went to the jail, and how many were hanged by the British”. It said while the entire country rose against the British during Quit India movement in 1942, RSS decided to join hands with the imperial masters to suppress the agitation.“It is our country’s misfortune that workers of a communal and hateful organisation like RSS are directly running govt. Those who have always advocated for Manusmriti over the Constitution are now becoming CMs and PMs in our country. How can we expect social, political, and economic justice from them?” the party asked. “While Congress, socialists, communists, and other revolutionary organisations were repeatedly banned, the British regime never imposed any ban on RSS. None of its volunteers were ever sent to jail, so they could stay outside and poison people’s mind with Hindu-Muslim division,” it added.“Even 78 years after Independence, RSS has only one agenda — seizing power by igniting Hindu-Muslim tensions, capturing institutions, and spreading hatred and frenzy. The situation is such that today, by misusing power, RSS has started selling out the country. If it is said that RSS is the root of most problems in the country, it would not be an exaggeration. The day this organisation stops setting the country on fire and hollowing it out, more than half of the problems will be resolved,” Congress said.","Congress posted on social media a video of party president Mallikarjun Kharge asking, “tell us how many of your people (RSS) went to the jail, and how many were hanged by the British” It said while the entire country rose against the British during Quit India movement in 1942, RSS decided to join hands with the imperial masters to suppress the agitation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124266201,imgsize-486194,width-400,resizemode-4/khrage-photo.jpg"

'Goldification': Akhilesh Yadav hits out at Centre as gold prices cross Rs 1 lakh; accuses BJP of hoarding black money,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/goldification-akhilesh-yadav-hits-out-at-centre-as-gold-prices-cross-rs-1-lakh-accuses-bjp-of-hoarding-black-money/articleshow/124256516.cms,"Akhilesh Yadav (ANI image)

Akhilesh Yadav's X post

NEW DELHI: Samajwadi Party president and former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav has accused the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of hoarding gold and converting “black money into solid assets,” a process he described as goldification.Yadav alleged that the recent surge in gold prices is not the result of rising demand among ordinary citizens but due to what he called large-scale hoarding by BJP leaders. He argued that under the “goldification” process, corrupt members of the ruling party are turning their illicit funds into precious metals.In a post on X, Yadav wrote: “The reason for the skyrocketing gold prices in BJP rule is not an increase in demand for gold among the common people; rather, the cause is the ‘goldification’ process by which the highly corrupt BJP members are converting their liquid black money into solid assets.”The SP leader further questioned whether the BJP’s “iron double engine” had in fact “turned into gold,” while demanding that the government explain why prices of luxury metals continue to rise despite international market fluctuations.He also mocked the ruling party, asking whether its much-publicised drones, binoculars and bulldozers were only meant for political opponents and not for tracking gold hoarders.According to Yadav, the soaring cost of gold has pushed even silver out of reach for the poor, depriving them of traditional practices such as gifting ornaments during weddings.“Now a poor man cannot even give a single gold clove to his loved ones as a blessing during weddings,” he said.Gold prices in Delhi touched Rs 1,18,790 per 10 grams (24K) today, compared to Rs 1,17,561 per 10 grams on Tuesday. Prices of the precious metal tend to fluctuate daily, influenced by global factors such as dollar movements and international demand, along with domestic taxes and seasonal buying trends.","Akhilesh Yadav accuses BJP of hoarding gold and converting “black money into solid assets” Yadav claims that under the “goldification” process, corrupt members of the ruling party are turning their illicit funds into precious metals.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124256571,imgsize-466938,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"
Hosabale: RSS custodian of India’s civilisational philosophy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hosabale-rss-custodian-of-indias-civilisational-philosophy/articleshow/124265978.cms,"Hosabale calls RSS custodian of India’s civilisational philosophy

NEW DELHI: RSS general secretary Dattatreya Hosabale on Wednesday celebrated the govt’s decision to release a commemorative postage stamp and coin as a “societal recognition” of the Sangh ’s century-long contribution, while defence minister Rajnath Singh marked the occasion by highlighting the role of swayamsevaks in communal harmony and nation building.Speaking at the Sangh’s centenary celebrations, where PM Narendra Modi was the chief guest, Hosabale said, “The release of the stamp and coin was emblematic of RSS’s journey from the fringes to the mainstream. Indifference, opposition, struggle — these all had to be overcome. Yet, while walking the path of indifference and opposition, today the Sangh has reached the stage of acceptance,” he said, adding that RSS is now being identified with India’s “civilisational philosophy”.The Rs 100 coin celebrating RSS’s contribution to nation building carries the national emblem on one side and on the other, an image of ‘Bharat Mata’ in Varad Mudra, with a lion being saluted by swayamsevaks — a depiction the PM noted as the first instance of Bharat Mata’s image appearing on Indian currency. The coin also bears the Sangh’s motto, “Rashtraya Swaha, Idam Rashtraya, Idam Na Mama.”Positioning the Sangh as a custodian of values rooted in Indian tradition, he said, “RSS has arrived — not merely as an organisation; it has come while practising for an idea.It is the idea of this soil, this land’s civilisation and culture.” “The Sangh opposes no one... taking all of society along, moving forward together — this is the Sangh’s song,” he said.Highlighting RSS’s contributions, Singh said it played the role of a saviour during the 1984 anti- Sikh riots, providing shelter, protection and relief to the Sikh community. “Noted author Khushwant Singh acknowledged this publicly when he said that RSS played an honourable role in maintaining Hindu-Sikh unity before and after Indira Gandhi’s assassination,” Singh said.On RSS being often unfairly criticised regarding its relationship with Mahatma Gandhi, he said that while it is true there were some differences of opinion on certain issues — as there were within the Congress fold itself — it would be “misleading to portray their relationship in terms of hostility or rivalry”. “Their differences never stood in the way of the mutual regard they shared. This was evident in 1934, when Gandhi ji visited an RSS camp in Wardha. He was struck by the organisation’s discipline, complete absence of untouchability, and rigorous simplicity,” he said.","RSS general secretary Dattatreya Hosabale celebrated the govt’s decision to release a commemorative postage stamp and coin.

NEW DELHI: Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) will finally get its long-awaited second airport — which will eventually overtake the existing Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Int’l Airport (CSMIA) in traffic handling capacity — this month. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA) on Oct 8.Ahead of the inauguration, Adani Group chairman Gautam Adani visited the project site for a comprehensive review and walkthrough of the final preparations. “Every runway, every terminal, every gate here carries the imprint of thousands of hands and hearts. This is more than an airport — it is a monument to the spirit of Bharat, built by its people, for its people,” Gautam Adani said.During his visit, the Adani Group chairman undertook a detailed inspection of the airport, which, once fully operational, will have the capacity to handle 9 crore passengers annually — placing it among the largest and most advanced airports in the world. Apart from assessing technical progress and operational readiness, Adani interacted with construction workers to understand their journeys, met engineers and project teams, engaged with firefighting staff to acknowledge their critical role in safety, and spent time with differently-abled staff at one of the terminal’s retail outlets.Flights will start at NMIA a week to 15 days after getting inaugurated. Starting with 60 daily flights (30 arrivals and as many departures) in the first month, the number will double after 30 days and then reach the 240-300 mark in six months.In its first phase with a capacity of 2 crore passengers annually (CPA), the greenfield airport will handle 400 daily flights which it will ramp up to in a year, Adani Group director (airports) Jeet Adani had recently told TOI in an exclusive interaction.“We aim to have both domestic and international operations at NMIA from Day One itself. If that does not happen for some reason, both will start for sure within the same month (Oct). The ratio of domestic and international flights will be 4:1 as T1 domestic capacity is 1.7 CPA and int’l is 30 lakh per annum. We have the flexibility to increase international passengers, based on demand,” Jeet, son of group patriarch Gautam Adani, had said.While in its initial days connectivity may be an issue, eventually NMIA will be the “most well connected” airport of India with a network of roads, rail, metro, air taxis and water connectivity. An aerocity is being developed here that will, among other things, have hotels in all ranges from budget to luxury.",Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA) on Oct 8.

The panel comprises representatives from the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority, capital market regulator Sebi, insurance watchdog IRDAI, EPFO and govt departments.Currently, insurance companies, mutual funds and entities regulated by PFRDA hawk pension plans. Besides, EPFO manages Employees Pension Scheme, each with their own management, investment & cost structures. While the issue has been on govt’s radar for over a decade, so far, no solution has been found as each entity is unwilling to agree to a common set of regulations. “Stakeholder consultations are underway, the objective is to have a predictable, citizen-centric pension market with clear rules and seamless services,” Sitharaman said.","Nirmala Sitharaman sought broadening its coverage, with a special focus on gig and platform workers & women.

JAIPUR: Rajasthan govt seems to have learnt no lessons from the 2021 Delhi episode when three children died after consuming a cough syrup containing dextromethorphan — the same drug now blamed for the death of a five-year-old in Sikar Monday, reports Intishab Ali.After the Delhi deaths, Directorate General of Health Services had directed all clinics and hospitals in the capital not to give dextromethorphan-based medicines to children below four years. Though the order wasn’t national, activists say state health officials should have taken note.In Rajasthan, however, the syrup was being prescribed to children under four at govt hospitals and centres under ‘free medicine’ scheme until it was paused after the Sikar death and reports of illness among kids in Sikar and Bharatpur.Kaysons Pharma supplied the syrup in June as part of this year’s purchase order, officials said, adding it has already been distributed to 1.33 lakh patients. In Delhi, a different company had supplied the drug.A health official admitted awareness of the Delhi incident but said other factors may be behind the Sikar fatality. “Samples have been sent for testing, and we are probing all aspects, including contamination,” he said. Rajasthan Medical Services Corporation has set up a three-member panel. But Jan Swasthya Abhiyan demanded an independent probe.",Rajasthan govt seems to have learnt no lessons from the 2021 Delhi episode when three children died after consuming a cough syrup containing dextromethorphan.

The Cool Desert project

Jodhpur RIFF festival will run from October 2nd to October 6th at the Mehrangarh Fort in Jodhpur

If the frenzy of hopping between gigs headlined by Coldplay or Diljit Dosanjh has left you drained, picture instead a festival that blends ancient music forms with contemporary influences, bringing together performances where genres flow together: from Rajasthani folk with classical jazz to beats of electronica and African percussion, with room for even reggae, Celtic and Romani traditions. No mad scramble for tickets, no rush-hour traffic.Jodhpur RIFF, India’s leading ""roots"" music festival held annually at the 15th-century Mehrangarh Fort, is built on living traditions of communities sharing their history and values with new audiences and generations by using rare instruments and a frequent focus on themes that reflect on everyday life, social conditions, love, struggle and empowerment. The 18th edition, opening October 2, gathers over 290 artists from the state of Rajasthan and 12 countries, including Portugal, Poland, Finland, Switzerland, Colombia, Canada, Bhutan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.Unlike typical global pop culture festivals, RIFF, run under the aegis of the Mehrangarh Museum Trust in Jodhpur, presents musicians who are stars in their homelands but often unknown abroad. ""Our notion of celebrity is shaped only by the media,"" says Divya Bhatia, festival director. ""But beyond globally known names, most of us are unaware of the true stars in different countries,"" he adds.""Similarly, the Rajasthani folk artists we present are among the greatest in the state.You won’t find them playing in small urban venues like Piano Man or Oddbird, but Jodhpur RIFF gives them a stage. India should take note of this,"" says Bhatia, listing out the spectrum of international artists performing this year, including Basel Rajoub, a Syrian-Swiss jazz saxophonist and Aga Khan Master Musician to Karolina Cicha, a Polish singer and multi-instrumentalist who delves into Tartar and Yiddish roots music. Portugal will bring the soulful fado of Helder Moutinho, while Colombia’s Killabeatmaker will blend Afro-Colombian and indigenous rhythms, apart from Bhutanese folk singer Sonam Dorji taking the stage. This year, the festival is also introducing artists from countries RIFF has never hosted before, such as Portugal, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan.Shashmaqam, a thousand-year-old classical music tradition from Central Asia with shamanic roots, is also making its debut at the festival. Incorporating poetry, melody and Sufi elements, it will be performed by Layla Tazhibayeva and Gulzoda Khudoynazarova from Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. On the other hand, London-based singer-songwriter Rosa Cecilia will infuse Latin jazz, neo-soul and disco with personal storytelling in her performance.The edition will also present one of India’s only women khartal players, young Mamta Sapera, alongside Padma Shri awardee Ashwini Bhide-Deshpande, who brings the classical khayal tradition of Jaipur-Atrauli with her vocal artistry. The younger generation is also in focus with groups like SAZ, a trio committed to preserving and evolving the Langa musical tradition through original compositions and collaborations. ""Last year, we released an album cover for SAZ. Their song 'Sundar Gori' has 1.4 million views on YouTube, and their music video has over 400,000 views. They could well be the celebrities of tomorrow. They will also release an album early next year. While most people only know of the Manganiyar, Langa are also now international celebrities,"" says Bhatia.From Tamil Nadu, fusion band Jatayu will blend Carnatic ragas with jazz and rock. Folk traditions will also be carried forward by the mother-daughter duo Ganga and Sundar, and the sisters Anita and Prem Dangi, rooted in the Rajwadi Maand heritage. Bhanwari Devi, first introduced by Jodhpur RIFF in 2010, returns as a nationally renowned folk vocalist. She has since collaborated with singer Rekha Bhardwaj and gained recognition across India. Bhatia cites Devi as an example of artists nurtured by Jodhpur RIFF who have grown into celebrated names, underscoring the festival’s role in elevating local musicians. ""The lineup is not just bigger this year, but richer,"" Bhatia reflects. ""We are building towards our 20th anniversary in 2027, and the festival's reputation has grown. More artists at the peak of their careers want to be part of this journey.""","Jodhpur RIFF, India’s leading ""roots"" music festival held annually at the 15th- century Mehrangarh Fort.

Tesla owner Elon Musk has set a new record, becoming the first person ever to build a fortune of almost $500 billion. The surge comes on the back of a rebound in Tesla’s stock and soaring valuations of his other ventures, including SpaceX and xAI.Forbes’ billionaires index put Musk’s net worth at $500.1 billion as of 4:15 PM ET on Wednesday. Much of that wealth is tied to Tesla, where he holds more than a 12.4% stake, Reuters reported.The electric carmaker’s stock has climbed over 14% this year and rose 3.3% on Wednesday alone, adding more than $6 billion to his fortune.Tesla shares have bounced back after a shaky start to the year, with investors encouraged by Musk’s renewed attention to his companies. Tesla chair Robyn Denholm noted last month that Musk was now back “front and center” at the firm after several months spent at the White House.Musk showed his commitment days later by buying about $1 billion worth of Tesla shares, a move seen as a strong show of faith in the company’s future as it pushes beyond cars towards AI and robotics.Still, challenges remain. Weak car sales and pressure on profit margins have left Tesla lagging behind its peers in the so-called “Magnificent Seven” group of tech giants.Even so, the company’s board has proposed a $1 trillion pay package for Musk, tying the deal to ambitious growth and operational goals while also addressing his demands for a larger stake, according to Reuters.Beyond Tesla, Musk’s other firms have been on the rise. His AI startup xAI was last valued at $75 billion in July, according to Pitchbook.Earlier in September, CNBC reported that it could seek a $200 billion valuation in future fundraising, though Musk insisted it was not raising money at the time. His rocket company SpaceX has also been in talks to sell insider shares, with Bloomberg reporting a potential valuation of around $400 billion.Oracle founder Larry Ellison trails Musk as the world’s second-richest person, with a fortune estimated at $350.7 billion as of Wednesday.","Elon Musk is the first person ever to build a fortune of almost $500 billion.

Post Office Small Savings Schemes Latest Interest Rate October-December 2025: The government has kept the interest rates for all small savings schemes, also popularly known as post office savings schemes, unchanged for the October to December 2025 quarter. This means that you will continue to earn the same interest rate on schemes like Public Provident Fund (PPF), Senior Citizens Savings Scheme (SCSS), National Savings Certificate, Kisan Vikas Patra, and Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana.The interest rates for these schemes, which are mainly managed by post offices and banks, have been unchanged for several quarters now. The last adjustments to certain schemes were made in the fourth quarter of 2023-24. The government maintains its practice of declaring interest rates for small savings schemes on a quarterly basis.As per the latest notification, the government has maintained the interest rates for key savings instruments, with the Public Provident Fund (PPF) offering 7.1%, whilst the National Savings Certificate yields 7.7%. Both the Senior Citizen Savings Scheme (SCSS) and Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana (SSY) deliver 8.2% returns.These small savings schemes are commonly referred to as post office schemes.A circular released by the Department of Economic Affairs, operating under the Finance Ministry, confirmed these rates on September 30, 2025.Post Office Savings Scheme rates are determined according to the Shyamala Gopinath Committee framework. These guidelines stipulate that small savings instruments' returns should correspond to secondary market yields on comparable Central Government Securities, incorporating a supplementary margin of 25 basis points.The computation of interest rates for 5-year time deposits should mirror the secondary market performance of 5-year G-secs, with an additional 25 basis points.Whilst the prescribed methodology indicates that falling repo rates and bond yields should trigger proportional decreases in small savings rates to maintain market alignment, the government's ultimate determinations sometimes deviate from these precise numerical computations.","The interest rates for these schemes, which are mainly managed by post offices and banks, have been unchanged for several quarters now.

Kamath outlined that this decline comes from a series of regulatory changes which include:Kamath emphasised that these changes have hit Zerodha’s primary revenue stream which is active options trading and is also forcing the company to reassess its business model.Known for his cautious outlook on the industry, Kamath wrote, “Another year where I was pessimistic about the business has passed, and it’s been another year where I’ve been pleasantly surprised. 🙂 That said, the regulatory actions, be it the drop in transaction charges revenue, the increase in STT on F&O, the proposal to make futures and options trading tougher, ASBA for trading, the increase in BSDA limit, etc., will have a significant impact on our revenues and profitability.The time has finally come for business to pivot.”Rivals in the industry already charge for delivery trades, Zerodha has maintained a zero-brokerage policy for years, contributing to its massive user base.

Accenture: Building an AI workforce







Accenture has reportedly laid off thousands of employees across the globe in the past three months. During earnings call, the company said that it is laying off employees that cannot be trained in AI, as Accenture looks to reshape its workforce for the AI era. It further added that it plans to expand headcount in the coming fiscal year.During the earnings call Accenture CEO Julie Sweet said that the company has been ""exiting"" employees it can't retrain with artificial intelligence skills. “We are exiting on a compressed timeline, people where reskilling, based on our experience, is not a viable path for the skills we need. And, we're continuously identifying areas of how we operate Accenture to drive more efficiencies, including through AI in order to create more investment capacity,” Accenture CEO said.At the end of August, Accenture’s global headcount stood at 779,000, down from 791,000 three months earlier. ""In FY26, we expect to increase our headcount overall across our three markets, including in the US and Europe, reflecting the demand we see in our business,"" said Julie Sweet. The restructuring at the company majorly covers severance costs and is said to save more than $1 billion for the company. Accenture CFO Angie Park said that the company will also divest two acquisitions as part of what the company calls “rapid talent rotation.” ""Before I move on to the details of the quarter, I want to spend a moment on the six-month business optimization program we initiated in Q4, for which we recorded a charge of $615 million and expect to record an additional approximately $250 million in Q1, for a total of approximately $865 million over the period. The business optimization program has two parts. One related to rapid talent rotation that Julie mentioned, which reflects severance associated with headcount reductions that we are making in a compressed timeline, and second, related to the divestiture of two acquisitions that are no longer aligned with our strategic priorities. These actions will result in cost-savings, which will be reinvested in our people and our business,"" he said.While trimming roles that don’t align with its future needs, Accenture is said to be aggressively expanding its AI capabilities. The company has revealed that it has doubled down on its AI and data specialists to 77,000 since 2023 and has also trained more than 550,000 employees in generative AI. “Advanced AI is becoming a part of everything we do,” Sweet said, adding that the company views AI not as “deflationary” but “expansionary. ”Despite the layoffs, Accenture reported a 7% year‑on‑year revenue increase to $17.6 billion in the June–August quarter of fiscal 2025, beating estimates. Sweet said the results demonstrate Accenture’s “unique ability to deliver for clients as they seek our help to reinvent and lead with AI.”It is quite clear that Accenture’s restructuring mirrors the trend across companies. Tech giants like Meta, Microsoft and others have also cut down on traditional job roles along with ramping the AI hiring process. For white-collar professionals, the message is clear: adapt to AI or risk obsolescence.","Accenture has reportedly laid off thousands of employees across the globe in the past three months.

1. All the products are developed in India. Our

global headquarters

is in Chennai and we pay taxes in India on our global income. As a global corporation headquartered in India, we have offices in over 80 countries and have a strong presence in the US which is a big market for us.

2. Indian customer data is hosted in India (Mumbai, Delhi and Chennai, soon Odissa). We have over 18 data centers globally and they host the respective country or regional data. We are committed to hosting each country data in their own jurisdiction.

3. All our services run on hardware we own and software frameworks we developed, on top of open source like

Linux

OS and Postgres database.

4. We do not host our products on AWS or Azure. Arattai, specifically, is not hosted on AWS or Azure or GCloud. We use some of those services for regional switching nodes to speed up traffic but data is not stored in them. We are adding many such ""points of presence"" (POPs) as we speak.

5. Our Zoho Developer account in the App Store and Play Store lists our US office address because the account was registered in the very early days of those stores by one of our employees in the US just to test them out. We never changed that.

We are proudly ""Made in India, Made for the World"" and we mean it.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has once again made an urgent appeal to Washington, arguing that allowing American technology companies to compete openly in China serves the best interests of both the countries.

However, this success has been complicated by escalating geopolitical tensions, which have severely disrupted sales in China, one of the world's largest markets.Earlier this year, the US temporarily blocked exports of the H20, a downgraded chip designed to comply with restrictions, before relenting after a 15% levy to the US government was agreed upon. In August, the White House announced that President Donald Trump and Huang had struck a deal under which Nvidia would receive export licenses in exchange for 15% of Chinese sales of the H20 going to the US government.In a related news, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang welcomed President Donald Trump's overhaul of the H-1B visa program but warned that the new $100,000 application fee may be prohibitively expensive, potentially driving tech investment and talent away from the United States.","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says U.S. companies should be able to compete openly in China.

Inflation watch: Numbers to be lower than RBI projections; why SBI expects softer prices,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/inflation-watch-numbers-to-be-lower-than-rbi-projections-why-sbi-expects-softer-prices/articleshow/124268748.cms,"



Inflation in FY26 and FY27 is expected to remain far below the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) estimates, according to a new report by the State Bank of India (SBI).The report cited several factors that will help to soothe price pressures, including a strong monsoon, higher kharif crop sowing, healthy reservoir levels, ample foodgrain stocks, and the major factor of rationalisation of GST rates, which were implemented recently.Considering these factors, the RBI had already lowered its CPI inflation forecast for FY26 by 50 basis points to 2.6%, marking a 160 basis point reduction from its April projection.However, in the new report, SBI suggests that inflation could be even lower, in both the current and the upcoming financial year.""RBI has revised downwards its FY26 CPI inflation projection by 50 bps to 2.6 per cent (a 160 basis point downward revision from April levels). We believe both FY26 and FY27 inflation numbers are likely to be much lower,"" SBI said in the report cited by ANI.The report also noted that RBI increased its real GDP growth estimate for FY26 to 6.8%, while inflation for FY27 is projected at 4.5%.Amid global economic uncertainty and market volatility, the Monetary Policy Committee’s (MPC) decision to keep the policy rate unchanged was seen as reasonable from a regulatory vision.The report also defended MPC’s decision to keep rates unchanged, saying that shows rare flexibility that extends beyond monetary policy.This approach, SBI said, is supported by enough liquidity and a stable external sector, despite ongoing uncertainties.It also emphasised that clear communication is key for guiding expectations and maintaining policy clarity.SBI said that the apex bank might have left some room for future rate cuts, although the timing remains uncertain.India’s financial system is well positioned to benefit from the forward-looking reforms aimed at strengthening the country’s global position and reinforcing its economic resilience, the report added.","Inflation in FY26 and FY27 is expected to remain far below the Reserve Bank of India’s estimates, according to a new report.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Brittany Renner says she cannot afford high cost of living in California

Brittany Renner claims her son cannot experience the same lifestyle as PJ Washington's family

Brittany Renner claimed that she can’t keep up with California’s high cost of living on the current child support from PJ Washington. With a stark difference between her modest life and Washington’s luxury lifestyle, she is asking the court for a big change. The move has raised questions about fairness in supporting their son’s lifestyle.The couple's first child support deal came from a North Carolina court ruling that was finalized in late September 2025, right before Renner asked for a modification. According to the agreement, Washington had to pay Renner $5,500 each month for their son's expenses, plus a one-time payment of $130,000 to settle past due amounts.This setup was worked out when both parents were living in North Carolina, where expenses were cheaper, and it took into account Washington's income back then as a mid-rotation player for the Hornets.Brittany Renner's request, submitted to the Los Angeles Superior Court on September 29, 2025, claims that the current monthly payment of $5,500 isn't enough anymore because she's moved to California and Washington's financial situation has gotten better.In the papers, which were exclusively acquired by TMZ, Renner addressed the court, ""I cannot afford the high cost of living given the current child support orders.""She further explained, ""I am struggling to make ends meet,"" stressing the full financial responsibility she now shoulders for their son's daily needs.Brittany Renner explained her shift from North Carolina to West Hills, California, mentioning in her filing that the move was crucial for better opportunities but has put a strain on her finances. She asked the court to require Washington to pay ""at least $35,000"" each month, a sum she called necessary to align the child's needs with his father's financial capabilities.Furthermore, Renner requested $50,000 to pay for her attorney fees associated with the modification, claiming it would create a fairer situation in the legal proceedings.A key point in Renner's filing is the clear difference between her humble situation and the wealthy lifestyle in Washington, which she claims puts their son at a disadvantage. She mentioned in court, ""I cannot provide [our son] a life anywhere similar to that of his father,"" using Washington's family social media posts as proof.Renner described her own setup plainly, ""In contrast, I live in a humble Airbnb rental in West Hills and shop for [our son’s] clothes at Target."" By comparison, she noted that Washington and his current wife ""have multiple luxury vehicles, constantly post their designer shopping clothes, and boast about luxury vacations."" She added, ""They also constantly post their children wearing designer clothing,"" underscoring how this disparity affects their shared child's sense of equity.Washington signed a four-year, $89 million contract extension with the Mavericks, this can be the reason why she asked for an increase in child support.Also Read: Napheesa Collier calls out WNBA’s weak leadership after Minnesota Lynx’s playoff collapse against Phoenix Mercury","P.J.

WASHINGTON: Scammers are among the top political ad spenders on Meta's platforms, using deepfake videos of American politicians including President Donald Trump to promote fake government benefits, a watchdog group said Wednesday.The nonprofit Tech Transparency Project said it identified 63 scam advertisers that collectively spent $49 million on Facebook and Instagram , often targeting seniors with ads promoting fake stimulus checks, government spending cards and healthcare payments.The ads have reached tens of thousands of the platforms' users.""The findings show how scammers are taking advantage of advances in artificial intelligence technology, public confusion around the status of social safety net programs, and lax Meta content moderation to target new victims,"" TTP said in a report.""Meta is allowing this activity even though it prohibits scams and says it invests in scam prevention to keep users safe,"" it added.Meta did not immediately respond to AFP's request for comment.TTP's report quoted a Meta statement saying that the company would ""invest in building new technical defenses"" as scammers ""constantly evolve their tactics to try to evade detection.""According to Meta's rules, advertisers who seek to run political ads in the United States have to undergo a special authorization process, which involves submitting an official ID such as a driver's license along with a US mailing address.TTP said all of the 63 scam advertisers who accounted for over 150,600 political ads had their advertisements removed by Meta within the past 12 months for violating the tech giant's policies. Still, nearly half of them continued to advertise as of Tuesday.Meta appeared to disable 35 ad accounts, but only after they ran dozens and in some cases hundreds of ads. Six of the accounts spent over $1 million before they were disabled or deleted, the report said.One advertiser identified by TTP called the Relief Eligibility Center ran an ad on Meta platforms in April and May featuring a deepfake video of Trump falsely promising stimulus checks to Americans.The video matched a speech by Trump in the White House's Rose Garden in early April, but TTP found that the words in the ad did not match the official transcript from the event.The ad, which directed users to a website to get a ""FREE $5,000 Check from Trump,"" appeared to target men and women over the age of 65 in more than 20 US states, TTP said.For years, professional fact-checkers have warned about bogus stimulus check offers circulating on social media platforms.The latest findings underscore the explosion of online fraud, with surveys showing a growing number of American adults experiencing internet scams or impersonation attacks.In August, the Federal Trade Commission reported a more than four-fold increase since 2020 in complaints from older adults who lost $10,000 or more sometimes their entire life savings to scammers impersonating trusted government agencies or businesses.","Scammers are among the top political ad spenders on Meta's platforms, watchdog group says. 63 scam advertisers collectively spent $49 million on Facebook and Instagram, it says.

What caused Elon Musk’s net worth to cross $500 billion

Elon Musk purchases $1 billion in Tesla stock





Tesla CEO Elon Musk has become the first person to reach a net worth of $500 billion. According to Forbes’s billionaires index, the tech CEO’s net wealth stood at $500.1 billion as of 4:15 p.m. ET on October 1. The jump was helped by a rebound in Tesla shares and rising valuations of his other companies. Musk was followed by Oracle founder Larry Ellison as the world’s second-richest person with a net worth of about $350.7 billion.Notably, Elon Musk’s fortunes are closely tied to Tesla where he owns more than 12% of the company. After a rocky start to the year, Tesla shares have been rising as Musk shifted his focus back to his companies.Stocks of the EV maker have increased by more than 14% this year. On Wednesday (October 1), Tesla shares rose 3.3%, adding more than $6 billion to his fortune.Musk’s other ventures, including AI startup xAI and rocket company SpaceX, have also seen their valuations climb. xAI was last valued at $75 billion in July and is rumored to be aiming for $200 billion. According to a Bloomberg report, SpaceX is also valued at about $400 billion after recent funding discussions.Last month, Elon Musk purchased nearly $1 billion worth of EV maker’s shares. As per a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the tech billionaire bought the stock indirectly through a trust on September 12. This marked Musk’s first open-market purchase of the stock since February 2020, with about 2.57 million shares bought.The stock purchases then coincided with Tesla’s board of directors chairman Robyn Denholm defending Musk’s $1 trillion proposed pay package saying the compensation should depend on his ability to achieve ‘seemingly impossible goals.’",Elon Musk has become the first person to reach a net worth of $500 billion.

Understanding how UAE fuel prices are set

Tips to save on fuel in 2025





The UAE Fuel Price Committee has announced the fuel prices for October 2025, reflecting a slight increase across all fuel types compared to September. These adjustments align with global oil market trends and are part of the UAE's monthly review process to keep domestic fuel prices in line with international rates.These price changes are determined based on the average global price of oil and are applicable across all Emirates, including Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, and others. The UAE's approach to fuel pricing ensures that residents and businesses experience consistent and transparent fuel costs. For people commuting daily to work, school, or errands, the small price hike may feel noticeable at the pump. Middle-class and lower-income residents can manage costs by:The recent increase in UAE fuel prices for October 2025 is closely linked to trends in the global oil market, which plays a major role in determining local fuel costs. Factors such as international supply and demand, geopolitical tensions in oil-producing regions, and fluctuations in crude oil prices all have a direct impact on the rates residents pay at the pump. For example, disruptions in major oil-exporting countries or unexpected changes in production can quickly drive up global prices, which then filter down to domestic markets. Additionally, seasonal demand spikes, such as increased travel during holidays, can also influence pricing.By understanding these global dynamics, everyday commuters and middle-class families can better anticipate changes and plan their monthly fuel budgets more effectively, rather than being caught off guard by sudden hikes.Fuel pricing in the UAE follows a deregulated model introduced in August 2015, which links local petrol and diesel rates to international oil prices. This policy ensures transparency and aligns retail prices with global market conditions. Each month, the UAE Fuel Price Committee reviews global trends and announces new rates, typically during the final days of the month. These rates take effect from the 1st day of the following month.This approach means UAE motorists feel the impact of both upswings and drops in the international energy market, encouraging more efficient fuel usage while maintaining pricing fairness.Looking to keep more dirhams in your pocket while filling up? Think of it as fuel-saving hacks for everyday heroes. First, carpooling like a boss sharing rides with friends or colleagues not only saves cash but also gives you some gossip time on the road. Next, combine your errands; that extra trip to the supermarket? Toss it in with the school run. Drive like a Zen master gentle acceleration, smooth braking, and no sudden sprints can stretch every litre farther. Don’t forget your car needs TLC too; proper tire pressure and timely servicing mean your engine sips fuel, not gulps it. And if you really want to be clever, fill up during off-peak hours, so you avoid long queues and unnecessary idling. A little planning and some smart moves can turn fuel anxiety into a monthly money-saving win.While the October 2025 fuel price adjustments represent a modest increase, they underscore the UAE's commitment to aligning domestic fuel prices with global market conditions. Staying informed about these changes allows consumers and businesses to plan and adapt accordingly.","The UAE Fuel Price Committee has announced the fuel prices for October 2025, reflecting a slight increase across all fuel types compared to September. Fuel pricing in the UAE follows a deregulated model introduced in August 2015, which links local petrol and diesel rates to international oil prices. The UAE's approach to fuel pricing ensures that residents and businesses experience consistent and transparent costs.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124229298,imgsize-1253296,width-400,resizemode-4/fuel-in-uae.jpg"

Thinking of inviting your parents, siblings, or even a friend, to visit you in the UAE? You’ll now need to show what’s in your paycheck. The country has introduced new income rules for sponsoring visitors, with different salary slabs depending on who you’re inviting. It’s part of a bigger shake-up to the UAE’s visa system, which now includes new categories, special permits, and updated rules for families, professionals, and humanitarian cases.Inviting someone to the UAE on a visit visa now depends not just on who they are, but also on how much you earn. As part of sweeping updates to its visa system, the UAE’s Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security (ICP) has introduced income-based eligibility rules for residents sponsoring friends and family.According to the ICP, the updated policy lays out three distinct salary thresholds:These new requirements are part of a broader set of regulatory updates introduced by the ICP. The income-based criteria are intended to ensure financial responsibility on the part of the sponsor and to streamline the process in a way that supports transparency and sustainable immigration management.According to the ICP, the changes were introduced following extensive studies that examined present and future trends in residency and international mobility.The analysis also incorporated feedback from customers, stakeholders, and frontline service centers. These insights were gathered via mechanisms such as customer councils, call centers, and the authority’s complaints and inquiry platforms.Once the visit visa is approved, visitors, whether family or friends, can generally stay in the UAE for 30 to 90 days, depending on the visa type issued. Some of these visas also come with the option to extend the stay, usually in two stages:These extensions are not automatic and are subject to approval and additional fees.If you're planning to sponsor a friend or relative, make sure all the required documents and conditions are in place before applying. The process is straightforward, but attention to detail matters. Here’s what’s expected:If you’re sponsoring a relative, you’ll need to submit proof of kinship and a valid justification for the visit. For instance, if you're sponsoring a foreign woman whose husband resides in the GCC, you must also attach a copy of his UAE or GCC residence permit.As part of the updated framework, the UAE has launched four new types of visit visas tailored to specific professional and economic sectors:These new categories are intended to attract global talent and enhance the UAE’s visibility as a destination for innovation, leisure, and industry-specific gatherings.Also read: UAE launches 4 new special Visit Visas for AI, cruise, events, and entertainment Beyond the visit visa updates, the ICP has introduced sweeping changes to residency rules, aimed at offering more flexibility across humanitarian, family, and professional circumstances. Here’s a summary of key developments:A one-year renewable residency permit can now be issued to foreigners from countries experiencing war, disasters, or unrest. Notably, this permit does not require a guarantor or host. Its issuance or cancellation will be based on reports by the General Directorate of Identity and Foreigners Affairs.Importantly, the Director General of Identity and Foreigners Affairs has the authority to waive standard requirements like financial solvency or kinship degree in special humanitarian cases involving relatives or in-laws. This aims to ensure compassionate handling of vulnerable individuals.Two categories of women are now eligible for a renewable one-year residence permit:All applicants must demonstrate financial capability and adequate housing. Custody disputes will be settled by a designated legal committee.Applicants must now either prove strong financial solvency related to their planned business, or clearly demonstrate they are already actively engaged in a similar business either abroad or through a registered UAE-based entity.Regulations for truck drivers have been streamlined. These visas can be single or multiple-entry and must be sponsored by licensed freight or logistics companies. Conditions include providing a financial guarantee, valid health insurance, and paying required government fees.","Residents must earn between AED 4,000 and AED 15,000 monthly to sponsor family or friends for UAE visit visas.

'If women can make it': Pete Hegseth calls for 'gender-neutral' fitness rules; signals fewer women in combat roles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/if-women-can-make-it-pete-hegseth-calls-for-gender-neutral-fitness-rules-signals-fewer-women-in-combat-roles/articleshow/124245105.cms,"US defense secretary Pete Hegseth (Pic credit: AP)

Trump’s Most Awkward Speech Yet? Generals Refuse to Clap, Silence Fills the Room | WATCH





US defense secretary Pete Hegseth on Tuesday announced new directives for the military, including implementing gender-neutral physical fitness standards and eliminating what he described as ""woke"" culture from the armed forces. The announcement came during an in-person meeting with military officials at the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia.The new policies are guided by what Hegseth calls the “1990 test,” which examines whether changes to military standards since 1990 were necessary due to evolving combat needs or were influenced by other priorities. “The 1990s test is simple. What were the military standards in 1990, and if they have changed, tell me why: Was it a necessary change based on the evolving landscape of combat, or was the change due to a softening, weakening or gender-based pursuit of other priorities?” he explained.“I don’t want my son serving alongside troops who are out of shape, or in a combat unit with females who can’t meet the same Combat Arms physical standards as men, or troops who are not fully proficient on their assigned weapons, platform, or task, or under a leader who was the first but not the best. Standards must be uniform, gender neutral and high,” Hegseth said.Women were first allowed in direct combat roles during the Obama administration.While Hegseth did not announce a full rollback of women in combat, he made it clear that the “highest male standards” would now apply to all combat roles. He acknowledged that this could result in fewer women qualifying for some positions.“We very much value the impact of female troops — our female officers and NCOs are the absolute best in the world. But when it comes to any job that requires physical power to perform in combat, those physical standards must be high and gender-neutral,” he said. “If women can make it, excellent. If not, it is what it is. If that means no women qualify for some combat jobs, so be it. That is not the intent, but it could be the result. ”Under the new rules, all combat personnel, including generals and admirals, will be required to pass two yearly physical tests. Hegseth emphasized that the standards are “gender neutral” but will be based on the “highest male standard” for physical fitness in combat roles.","US defense secretary Pete Hegseth on Tuesday announced new directives for the military.

The Trump administration on Wednesday announced a freeze on roughly $18 billion in funding for two major New York City infrastructure projects.The funding was earmarked for the Hudson River Tunnel Project (Gateway) and the Second Avenue Subway project, according to Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought.In a post on X, Vought wrote: “Roughly $18 billion in New York City infrastructure projects have been put on hold to ensure funding is not flowing based on unconstitutional DEI principles.”DEI refers to diversity, equity and inclusion policies, which have come under scrutiny by the Trump administration.Vought’s announcement came on the first day of a US government shutdown, triggered after Congress failed to pass stopgap funding bills that would have kept federal agencies and services operating for at least seven more weeks.The Trump administration has blamed the two top Democrats in Congress, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both from New York City, for the shutdown.The Gateway project, costing more than $16 billion, aims to build a second rail tunnel under the Hudson River, adding capacity to two single-track tunnels that carry Amtrak and New Jersey Transit trains to Penn Station, Midtown Manhattan, from New Jersey and back.The Second Avenue Subway is an ongoing expansion along Manhattan’s East Side.The Hudson River rail tunnel has been a long-delayed project, intended to ease the strain on a century-old tunnel connecting New York and New Jersey. Hundreds of Amtrak and commuter trains carry hundreds of thousands of passengers through the tunnel daily, with delays potentially affecting travel along the East Coast between Boston and Washington.","The funding was earmarked for the Hudson River Tunnel Project (Gateway) and the Second Avenue Subway project.

Offline nation: Taliban cuts internet to prevent 'vice'; cripples daily life of Afghans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/offline-nation-taliban-cuts-internet-to-prevent-vice-cripples-daily-life-of-afghans/articleshow/124230141.cms,"In this February 10, 2016 photo, Afghans access social media websites at a private internet cafe in Kabul, Afghanistan.

Poll Do you believe the Taliban's suspension of internet services is justified? Yes, to prevent immorality No, it's an infringement on rights





The Taliban government in Afghanistan has ordered a nationwide suspension of internet and mobile phone service, following weeks of cutting fibre-optic internet connections in different provinces.According to internet watchdog NetBlocks, the country is experiencing a ""total internet blackout."" The group reported that the disruption appears to be the most extensive and coordinated shutdown of telecom services in Afghanistan since the Taliban regained control in 2021. The blackout has raised concerns about the return of earlier restrictions from the Taliban’s first rule, when they banned television, satellite dishes, and other forms of mass communication in what they described as a campaign against immorality.The government had already started reducing high-speed internet access in some provinces earlier this month. Officials said this was done to prevent ""vice,"" following orders from the Taliban’s supreme leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada.By Monday night, mobile phone signals and internet access steadily weakened across the country until overall connectivity dropped to less than one percent of normal activity, NetBlocks reported.It is the first time since the Taliban seized power in 2021, after years of insurgency, that communication services across the nation have been cut off. Since then, the group has enforced a strict version of Islamic law and imposed several restrictions.Residents expressed concern over the impact of the blackout on daily life and business. ""We are blind without phones and internet,"" Najibullah, a 42-year-old shopkeeper in Kabul, was quoted as saying by the news agency AFP. ""All our business relies on mobiles. The deliveries are with mobiles. It's like a holiday, everyone is at home. The market is totally frozen.""The Taliban have not issued an official explanation for the nationwide suspension. A government official, however, said that “eight to nine thousand telecommunications pillars” would be switched off and added that the blackout would remain in place “until further notice.”Just last year, in 2024, the Taliban had described Afghanistan’s fibre-optic project as a key priority. The 9,350-kilometre (5,800-mile) network, developed mostly during governments backed by the United States, was promoted as a way to connect the country with the outside world and support economic recovery.Earlier in September, Taliban representatives warned that they planned to cut off internet access nationwide “to prevent immoral activities.” They did not specify what was considered immoral under their order.Haji Zaid, the governor of Balkh province, said in a statement that ""an alternative system will be established within the country for essential needs."" He did not clarify what this system would include or how it would function.","The Taliban government in Afghanistan has ordered a nationwide suspension of internet and mobile phone service.

Yunus discusses SAARC revival with US envoy Gor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/yunus-discusses-saarc-revival-with-us-ambassador-designate-to-india-sergio-gor/articleshow/124078736.cms,"File photos





While it’s well known that Bangladesh Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus wants South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) revived, he has now raised the issue with Sergio Gor, the US ambassador-designate to India who will also play the role of Special Envoy for South and Central Asia.Yunus met Gor on the margins of the ongoing UNGA session in New York. According to Dhaka, the chief advisor noted that the interim government has intensified efforts to revive SAARC, which has not held a summit in over a decade.SAARC summits are held biennially but the process has remained stalled since the summit in Kathmandu in 2014. The Uri terrorist attack in 2016 put paid to the summit that Pakistan was scheduled to host that year and India has since maintained Pakistan’s continued support for cross-border terrorism has made unfeasible the SAARC dialogue, including summits and important meetings.However, India has continued to support SAARC activities in diverse sectors for closer cooperation and blamed Pakistan for blocking trade and connectivity initiatives in the region. While it hasn’t withdrawn from the Association, India has sought to strengthen regional cooperation through the BIMSTEC grouping in which Pakistan is not a member.The US readout said regional cooperation was discussed but didn’t specifically mention SAARC.Bangladesh didn’t say what Gor’s response was to Yunus’ remarks on SAARC but India will be wary of any external pressure to resume the summit process. The idea of Pakistan hosting even a virtual summit has been rendered a non-starter because of the Pahalgam terrorist attack that led to a dramatic military clash between India and Pakistan.India sees the appointment of Gor as ambassador by the Trump administration as a welcome development but will guard against any US attempt to intrude into South Asian affairs through Gor’s dual role, particularly if it has any security fallout for the region. India is already worried about security challenges that Dhaka’s warming ties with Pakistan might entail. It has shown little interest so far in Yunus’ efforts to, as he said earlier, revive the spirit of SAARC.While countries like Bangladesh and Nepal seek a resumption of the summit process, India maintains that there has been no material change in the situation since the 19th summit that Pakistan had to host was postponed and that there’s no consensus among members on the meeting.India closely followed a China-Pakistan-Bangladesh trilateral meeting at Kunming, taking note of reports that this was an effort to create a new bloc in the region, However, Dhaka later denied this was an effort to forge an alliance against any country.Yunus also discussed with Gor the Rohingya crisis, and the “proliferation of disinformation targeting Dhaka”. Yunus has in the past described as fake news some of the reports in Indian media about targeting of Hindus in Bangladesh .According to Dhaka, Yunus also expressed Bangladesh’s interest in joining ASEAN, stating that integration with Southeast Asian economies could significantly accelerate the country’s development. He told Gor Dhaka ismaking “comprehensive preparations” to ensure a free, fair, and peaceful general election in the first half of February.","Bangladesh Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus wants South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) revived.

Her research proved that primates display behaviors remarkably similar to humans, including communication, individual personalities, and the ability to make and use tools.Her discoveries as an ethologist “revolutionized science, and she was a tireless advocate for the protection and restoration of our natural world,” the institute said. Goodall later earned a PhD in ethology from the University of Cambridge, with her thesis documenting the first five years of her study at the Gombe Stream Reserve.In 1977, she co-founded the Jane Goodall Institute with Genevieve di San Faustino. Headquartered in Washington, D.C., with offices in 25 cities worldwide, the institute works to improve the treatment and understanding of primates through public education and legal representation.Goodall’s work earned her both scientific recognition and global fame. She is credited with inspiring generations of women to pursue careers in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics). According to the Jane Goodall Institute, the number of women in STEM has grown from 7% in 1970 to 26% by 2011.In April 2002, Goodall was named a United Nations Messenger of Peace. Even in her 80s and 90s, she remained active in advocating for environmental conservation and sustainable practices around the world.Her passing marks the end of an era in primatology and environmental advocacy, leaving behind a legacy of scientific achievement and tireless dedication to the natural world.","Jane Goodall, the legendary British primatologist, conservationist, and founder of the Jane Goodall Institute, passed away at the age of 91 due to natural causes.
