NEW DELHI: A huge uproar erupted in the packed auditorium of Kellogg College at Oxford University as West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee delivered her maiden speech.She was speaking on ' Empowerment of Women in Bengal and its Success', following an invitation from the institution.The chief minister was interrupted suddenly by a group of protesting students, who tried to disrupt her speech by raising the issue of post-poll violence and the RG Kar College rape-murder case .""Please speak clearly. You have the right to speak, this is a democracy,"" she responded.""Love you, brother. If you want to do politics, go tell your party in my state. I will send chocolate to you and your ideology,"" Mamata was heard telling the protesters.She also pulled out a black-and-white photograph from August 16, 1990, showing her injuries and bandages following a violent attack by CPM supporters at Kolkata's Hazra crossing.On RG Kar, the CM made it clear that the case was ""sub judice"" and the Centre (CBI) was now tasked with the probe.""This matter is not related to politics. This case is with the central government and is sub judice. Do not do politics here,"" she told the protesters.Another person asked the West Bengal chief minister whether she was ""anti-Hindu.""She replied, ""I work for everyone. I have been elected as an MP seven times and do not take a single rupee as pension from the government.""

She also stressed the importance of inclusive development and stated that division in society is counterproductive.""If I die, before my death, I want to see unity. Unity is our strength, and division leads to our fall. This was Swami Vivekananda's belief. Keeping unity is a difficult task, but dividing people takes only a moment. Do you think the world can sustain such a divisive ideology?"" she asked.""When I am in the chair, I cannot divide society. I have to look after the weaker sections and the poor.

It demanded that LS send the bill to the JPC for scrutiny.Congress’ Manish Tewari and other MPs alleged the bill lacked the balance between law and fundamental rights.

Yet, despite repeated appeals, some govts have not signed. They should not deny their students the opportunity to learn in modernised, better-equipped schools,” Govt sources said.The source further stated, “This is not just a matter of policy — it’s a matter of basic fairness.

House panel slams HAL 'inefficiencies',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/house-panel-slams-hal-inefficiencies/articleshow/119623426.cms,"Already facing flak for the huge delay in production of the indigenous Tejas fighters as well as the grounding of the over 330 Dhruv advanced light helicopters for safety checks since a crash on Jan 5, Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) came under fresh ack-ack fire on Thursday in Parliament.The parliamentary committee on public undertakings slammed HAL for prolonged project timelines, impaired costs, and missed strategic opportunities. “Systemic inefficiencies continue to hinder HAL’s ability to meet operational demands (of the armed forces) effectively,” it said.IAF chief Air Chief Marshal A P Singh in recent weeks has publicly lashed out at HAL, noting that he was “just not confident” of the defence PSU, which was a “very wrong” thing to happen. The IAF is “very badly off in numbers” and needs to induct at least 40 fighters every year to stay combat ready, he said.The committee, on its part, stressed the “urgent need” for HAL to transition from a “reactive to a proactive R&D strategy”, ensuring that technological advancements align seamlessly with national defence objectives and market requirements.While recognizing HAL’s pivotal role in advancing the country’s defence and aerospace capabilities, contributing significantly to indigenous aircraft, helicopters and engine development, the committee said a CAG report of 2023 had highlighted “critical shortcomings” in its project planning, execution, procurement delays and cost overruns.“The committee firmly believes that rigorous adherence to pre-project processes, enhanced risk assessment mechanisms, and structured stakeholder engagements are essential for HAL to achieve global competitiveness in defence manufacturing,” it said.Strengthening financial oversight, establishing robust market research frameworks, and ensuring timely compliance with international certification standards is crucial for HAL to position itself as a leading aerospace powerhouse on the global stage.The committee urged the HAL and defence ministry to implement the recommendations in letter and spirit, ensuring that future projects are executed with greater efficiency, financial prudence, and strategic foresight.“The success of India’s defence modernization and indigenization efforts will depend not just on technological advancements but on the ability to integrate innovation with effective project management, accountability, and long-term vision. HAL’s progress in these areas will not only strengthen national security but also cement India’s position as a global leader in defence and aerospace manufacturing,” it said.","The parliamentary committee on public undertakings slammed HAL for prolonged project timelines, impaired costs, and missed strategic opportunities. “Systemic inefficiencies continue to hinder HAL’s ability to meet operational demands (of the armed forces) effectively,” it said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119623444,imgsize-24094,width-400,resizemode-4/119623444.jpg"

Resolution against Waqf Amendment Bill



'Clever political move'



NEW DELHI: Assembly elections in Tamil Nadu are nearly a year away, but it seems chief minister MK Stalin has already managed to set the agenda for the polls by latching on to some of the key issues raised by the BJP When Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan asked the DMK government in Tamil Nadu to implement the three-language policy, MK Stalin turned it into an issue of state's rights alleging that it was not the National Education Policy that the BJP was trying to implement but a ""saffron policy"" aimed at developing Hindi and not the nation.Raising fears of ""Hindi imposition"" on the state, Stalin claimed that Tamil Nadu was ready for another language war.The Tamil Nadu chief minister did not stop at that. He simultaneously raised the pitch on the ""threat"" of Tamil Nadu losing Lok Sabha seats under the proposed delimitation and called an all-party meeting on the issue to ensure that the state was not penalised for ensuring development and controlling population.""In the name of delimitation, a sword is hanging over southern states. Tamil Nadu succeeded in population control through the family planning programme. Just because population is less, there is a situation of the Lok Sabha seats being cut down (in TN). We stand to lose 8 seats and as a result, we would be having only 31 MPs, and not the 39 (present number). Our representation (in Parliament) will reduce, Tamil Nadu's voice is being stifled. This is a mater of Tamil Nadu's rights. All leaders and political parties should jointly speak across party lines on the issue,"" Stalin said raising the pitch.""Prime Minister Narendra Modi, I have an appeal! Try to develop India rather than Hindi. Sanskrit cannot be developed even if you spend thousands of crores. You will spend crores to develop a language that is not spoken by the people. Will you betray our Tamil language that is recognised in several countries and spoken by the people?"" he added.With the three-language policy an emotive issue in the state, even Stalin's political opponents were forced to attend his meeting.The Tamil Nadu chief minister later took the lead in mobilising other southern states and chaired a meeting on the issue of delimitation and its fallout on these states.Stalin followed up his language and delimitation offensive by raising the pitch against the Centre's Waqf Amendment Bill. The Tamil Nadu assembly passed a resolution against the proposed Waqf Bill in the assembly and insisted that the Union government recall the Bill as it would badly affect the minority Muslims.Piloting the resolution, Stalin said the bill is ""destroying the rights of Muslims. This is against the freedom of religion. This is hurting Muslim sentiments."" The Tamil Nadu CM further claimed the Bill was an assault on the constitutional rights of minorities and their institutions.While the BJP walked out, all other parties including the principal opposition AIADMK and NDA partner the PMK supported the resolution.""All parties in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly have unanimously passed a resolution opposing the Waqf (Amendment) Bill to be brought by the Union BJP government! The BJP is working with the aim of crippling the functioning of the Waqf organisation by making several amendments at once, without any demand from Muslims,"" Stalin wrote on X.Senior journalist and political analyst Vijaya Sankar says chief minister Stalin has played a smart political game in the run up to the assembly elections next year.""It was a clever move on the part of the DMK chief. Instead of making it a party issue, Stalin made the language and delimitation issues a question of Tamil Nadu's pride and ensured the backing of even his political opponents,"" he says.""The resolution against the Waqf Bill in the state assembly will help the ruling DMK consolidate the Muslims who constitute around 12% of population,"" says Vijaya Sankar.The BJP and the AIADMK have accused Stalin of orchestrating ""political drama."" Their attacks notwithstanding, the fact is that Stalin has managed to set the narrative and has forced his political opponents to back him on these issues.One look at Stalin's response to Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath's attacks on language row and it sums up how Tamil Nadu chief minister has tried to turn the controversy over these issues into an advantage for his party.""Tamil Nadu's fair and firm voice on #TwoLanguagePolicy and #FairDelimitation is echoing nationwide--and the BJP is clearly rattled. Just watch their leaders' interviews. And now Hon'ble Yogi Adityanath wants to lecture us on hate? Spare us. This isn't irony--it's political black comedy at its darkest. We don't oppose any language; we oppose imposition and chauvinism. This isn't riot-for-votes politics. This is a battle for dignity and justice,"" Stalin posted on X.Stalin may now try to keep these issues alive as the state approaches next year’s assembly elections.","Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin has already managed to set the agenda for the assembly elections. He has turned the controversy over the three-language policy into an issue of state's rights. He also raised the pitch on the ""threat"" of Tamil Nadu losing Lok Sabha seats under proposed delimitation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119608367,imgsize-1125242,width-400,resizemode-4/119608367.jpg"

Disagree Somewhat agree Strongly agree

NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party MP Raghav Chadha on Tuesday raised concerns in the Rajya Sabha about India's position in artificial intelligence (AI), as the United States and China continue to advance in the field.He pointed out that while America has developed AI models like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Grok, and China has introduced DeepSeek, India’s progress in AI remains unclear.""China has DeepSeek, the US has ChatGPT, Grok, but where does India stand in this era of Artificial Intelligence?"" Chadha asked in the Upper House of the Parlaiment.He questioned whether India was falling behind in AI and if the country would be able to develop its own generative AI model.Citing data from 2010 to 2022, Chadha said that 60 per cent of the world’s AI patents were registered by the United States and 20 per cent by China. ""Between 2010 and 2022, 60 per cent of the world's AI patents were registered by the USA, and 20 per cent by China. India, the fifth-largest economy in the world, managed to capture only half a per cent. It is true that the USA and China have a head start of four to five years, but this is because they have invested in their research, academia, and AI development,"" Chadha said.""It is said that 15 per cent of the total AI workforce consists of Indians. Around 4,50,000 Indian AI professionals are working in foreign countries. This means that India has talent, hardworking people, brainpower, and a digital economy. However, despite all this, India has become a consumer of AI today, not a producer,"" Chadha further said.He also noted that India has over 90 crore internet users, yet the country is primarily an AI consumer rather than a producer.Chadha also referred to OpenAI founder Sam Altman’s comments, where he described India's AI potential as ""disappointing."" He urged the government to focus on becoming a producer of AI.To strengthen India’s position in AI, Chadha suggested steps such as producing indigenous AI chips, creating a dedicated AI infrastructure fund, providing research grants, offering tax incentives, and preventing talent migration.""The time has come when India should become an AI producer rather than an AI consumer. For this, we need to start making indigenous AI chips in the country. We should start an AI Infra Fund. We should also stop talent migration so that India's top-tier AI talent remains in the country,"" he said.He pointed out that financial investment in AI needs to increase, noting that the US spends 3.5 per cent of its GDP on AI research, China 2.5 per cent, while India spends only 0.7 per cent.""In the future, the nation that dominates AI will lead the world and become a global guru. Therefore, alongside 'Make in India,' India must also move forward with 'Make AI in India ,'"" the AAP MP said.Last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the Artificial Intelligence Summit in Paris, where he said AI could help improve sectors like health, agriculture, and education.",Aam Aadmi Party MP Raghav Chadha raised concerns about India's position in artificial intelligence.

Armed forces conduct massive integrated exercise in Arunachal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/armed-forces-conduct-massive-integrated-exercise-in-arunachal/articleshow/119613487.cms,"NEW DELHI: India-China diplomatic talks may now be taking a slightly “positive” trajectory but the armed forces continue to hone their high-altitude combat skills through intensive exercises, while the Army is raising a new infantry division of around 15,000 soldiers as part of its continuing rejig of forces and firepower for the northern borders.‘Prachand Prahar (fierce attack)’ is the telling name of the latest integrated tri-Service multi-domain warfare exercise conducted ‘deep’ in the high-altitude terrain of Arunachal Pradesh in the eastern sector of the 3,488-km long Line of Actual Control (LAC) over the last three days.“The exercise involved Army, IAF and the other combat elements in a synergised combat drill designed to simulate future warfare. It reinforces India’s resolve to deter and, if necessary, decisively respond to any emerging security challenge along its strategic frontiers,” a senior officer said.Towards the western sector of the LAC, which stretches from eastern Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh, the headquarters of the new 72 Infantry Division is coming up at Pathankot under the Udhampur-based Northern Command. “There will be no fresh accretion of troops for the 72 Division. It’s part of the Army’s restructuring and reorganization plan that has been underway for some years,” a source told TOI.The new division is likely to eventually replace the “Uniform Force” of the Army’s specialized counter-insurgency Rashtriya Rifles (RR) that was rushed to eastern Ladakh after the multiple incursions by Chinese troops there in April 2020.In addition to the Panagarh-based 17 Mountain Strike Corps for the eastern sector, the Mathura-based 1 Strike Corps (each corps has 70,000-80,000 soldiers) was earlier also “rebalanced” to the LAC from its previous role on the western front with Pakistan, as was reported by TOI.There are as yet no signs of de-escalation and de-induction of troops along the LAC after disengagement at the two remaining face-off sites at Depsang and Demchok in eastern Ladakh last Oct, which has led to restoration of patrolling by the rival soldiers and grazing by herders as well as reduced the risk of any inadvertent escalation.China has continued to strengthen its military positions and infrastructure build-up all along the LAC, with PLA troops continuing to be forward deployed with heavy weapon systems in large numbers.India, too, has maintained “mirror deployments”. In Arunachal, areas like Yangtse -- where the rival troops had clashed in Dec 2022 -- Asaphila and Subansiri river valley remain major flashpoints.During Prachand Prahar, long-range maritime reconnaissance aircraft, armed helicopters, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), loitering munitions, and space-based assets were employed to achieve total situational awareness and rapid target engagement.“Once simulated targets were identified, they were swiftly neutralised through coordinated strikes using fighter aircraft, long-range Pinaka rocket systems, medium artillery guns, swarm drones, kamikaze drones, and armed helicopters — all executed in an electronically contested environment that simulated modern battlefield conditions,” another officer said.This integrated tri-service exercise builds on the momentum of the `Poorvi Prahar’ exercise last Nov, which focused primarily on the integrated application of aviation assets. “Prachand Prahaar has now taken that concept further by validating a fully integrated approach to surveillance, command and control, and precision firepower across the three Services,” he said.","The Army is raising a new infantry division of around 15,000 soldiers as part of its continuing rejig of forces and firepower for the northern borders. ‘Prachand Prahar (fierce attack)’ is the telling name of the latest integrated tri-Service multi-domain warfare exercise conducted ‘deep’ in the high-altitude terrain of Arunachal Pradesh.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119613442,imgsize-904384,width-400,resizemode-4/119613442.jpg"

Now they enter India through West Bengal where TMC is in power,"" he stated. ""Who issues them Aadhaar cards, citizenship?... All the Bangladeshis who have been caught have Aadhaar cards from 24 Parganas district. You (TMC) issue Aadhaar cards and they come to Delhi with voter cards... In 2026, the BJP government will be formed in West Bengal and we will put an end to this.""He also drew attention to the need for stricter immigration laws to safeguard national security and monitor foreign arrivals.Highlighting India's growing economic stature and the increasing influx of foreigners, Shah said, ""In the last ten years, India has become the fifth-largest economy. India has emerged as a bright spot among the world's largest economies. India has become a hub of manufacturing, and it is natural for people from all over the world to come to India.""However, he warned that infiltration for ulterior motives has also increased. ""The number of people taking refuge in India for personal gain and making the country unsafe has also increased... Be it Rohingyas or Bangladeshis, if they come to India to create unrest, strict action will be taken against them.""Defending the Immigration and Foreigners Bill, Shah said it was necessary for national security. ""Immigration is not an isolated issue. For the security of India, we must know who is entering our country, for how long, and for what reasons."" He added that the bill would introduce a structured system to monitor foreigners. ""With the Immigration and Foreigners Bill, we will establish a detailed and structured system to track every foreigner entering the country. This will help us develop the nation and monitor those coming for business. It will also allow us to keep a sharp eye on individuals who may pose a threat to our security.""Focusing on India's historical role in providing refuge, Shah said, ""India is a geo-cultural nation, not a geo-political nation. Persians came to India and are safe in the country today. The world's smallest minority community is safe only in India. Jews fled from Israel and stayed in India. During Prime Minister Modi's tenure, people from six oppressed communities from neighboring countries are taking refuge in the country through CAA.""Shah also made it clear that national security would remain a top priority. ""Those who pose a threat to national security will not be allowed to enter the nation. The nation is not a 'Dharamshala'... If someone comes to the nation to contribute to its development, they are always welcome.""Responding to Amit Shah's accusations against Mamata Banerjee, TMC MP Saugata Roy dismissed the claims as baseless. ""All the allegations of Union home minister Amit Shah are false,"" he said. Roy further criticized the central government for delays in installing border fencing, stating, ""They can't blame us for that."" He also asserted, ""BJP will not come into power in West Bengal in 100 years.""Following Shah's address, the Immigration and Foreigners Bill, 2025, was passed in the Lok Sabha.","Union home minister Amit Shah accused Mamata Banerjee-led West Bengal government of obstructing border security efforts.

Poll What is your primary concern regarding US visa appointment availability? Lack of transparency Fraudulent practices Reliability of agents Long wait times

NEW DELHI: The United States is cracking down on “bots” blocking substantial visa interview appointment dates in India, leaving many applicants with no option but to pay agents about Rs 30,000-35,000 per person to get the same in time for their proposed visit.The US embassy in India said on Wednesday on X: “Consular Team India is cancelling about 2,000 visa appointments made by bots. We have zero tolerance for agents and fixers who violate our scheduling policies. Effective immediately, we are cancelling these appointments and suspending the associated accounts’ scheduling privileges (sic).”“We will continue our anti-fraud efforts. We have zero tolerance for frauds,” the post added. It is an open secret in travel industry that while there’s a long wait for appointment dates for US visas — business & visitor B1/B2 & student — paying an agent magically secures a slot within a month or so.“We tried to get a visa interview date on our own for our child who had to join an American university last fall but nothing was available in the timeframe to do so. We paid an agent Rs 30,000 and got the same in time,” a person said on condition of anonymity. Similarly, the wait for a B1/B2 is over six months but paying Rs 30-35,000 could mean getting one within a month or so.Sources say agents use bots to block appointment dates due to which no near-term availability is visible when applicants want to book one on their own. When the wait for B1/B2 appointments was near the 999-day mark in 2023, the US had to open appointments for Indian applicants at its consulates in Frankfurt and Bangkok, among other places.India had also taken up the issue of long visa wait times with the US 2-3 years ago. The US took a series of steps to cut waiting times. Now, with US cracking down on bots, the situation might improve further.","The US embassy in India is cancelling about 2,000 visa appointments made by bots.

"Healthy budgetary allocation must for infrastructure, health, education: SC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/healthy-budgetary-allocation-must-for-infrastructure-health-education-sc/articleshow/119623335.cms,"New Delhi: Supreme Court on Thursday underlined the importance of healthy budgetary allocation by states for improving infrastructure, health and education and said mindless privatisation of these key sectors linked to human resource development would spell disaster.“It is high time for states to dedicate a part of their budget for development of infrastructure, health and education sectors. Otherwise, all these would be in private hands and commercially exploited. It will lead to the rich getting better amenities and the poor nothing,” a bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh said.The SC was also against selling state assets to fund development projects. “Selling assets to generate funds is not a solution. The political executive has a better understanding of the issues than us. So, they must take policy decisions in this regard,” the bench said. The court was hearing a dispute relating to 38 acres of prime land situated between Hyderabad and Secunderabad, which was purchased in 1964 by Kalyan Nagar Cooperative Society for construction of houses for its members. However, the land came to be encroached, and the society could never take possession of it.After hearing additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati for the Telangana govt, senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy for the civic body and senior advocate Guru Krishna Kumar for the society, the bench found that most of the encroachers were slum-dwellers who had moved out after transferring their land to other people who had now built multi-storied houses there.The SC laid out the options to be weighed by the state: compensation to be paid by the authorities to society members at present market rate and recovery of the amount from the encroachers as regularisation and development fee; find alternative parcels of land for allotment to the society and to the encroachers and use the vacated land for commercial use or other projects that would get investment for the state.“Decision on this issue will require detailed deliberations on the suggested options. The state could also think of any better option,” the bench said.","The court was hearing a dispute relating to 38 acres of prime land situated between Hyderabad and Secunderabad.

The letter lamented that a deputy speaker has not been appointed since 2019, despite it being mandatory.It also criticised “intervention” by the Speaker’s office in the functioning of Parliamentary standing committees by “suggesting corrections in committee reports” — which compromises the autonomy of the panels. The letter said that opposition parties are not being consulted on the composition and chairmanship of Parliamentary committees panels and some “consultative committees” do not meet regularly. It slammed the denial of opportunity to Rahul Gandhi to speak in LS, in what appeared a reference to the Chair turning him down on Wednesday after the Speaker’s censure, and after PM Narendra Modi’s speech on Kumbh last week. “This breaks from past Parliamentary practices and diminishes the space for healthy debate in the House,” the letter said.Importantly, INDIA bloc said key ministries had been left out of budget discussions, “reducing Parliamentary oversight over financial decisions”. In an echo of its old grievance, the opposition said Rule 193, which allows debates on urgent public issues without voting, is rarely invoked now, “thereby avoiding accountability on pressing national matters”.",Joint opposition complains to Speaker Om Birla that leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi was being repeatedly denied the opportunity to speak in contravention of parliamentary norms.

NEW DELHI: The role and conduct of some middle-rung police officers and a few first responders is under the scanner in the fire incident at Justice Yashwant Varma’s official residence, from where piles of burnt currency were recovered, sources said.On the day the Delhi fire chief appeared before the Supreme Court-constituted panel probing the matter, sources said two officers, along with their junior colleagues who happened to be on the spot at Tughlaq Road on the night of March 14, are likely to be probed on whether they allowed themselves to be sweet-talked by a woman into accessing the storeroom at Justice Varma’s residence where a fire had broken out. TNNThe development acquires significance in view of twin questions topmost on many minds, including those of the probe panel and, possibly, SC collegium — what happened to the burnt notes and whether there were other bags which escaped the fire and, if so, what happened to the intact currency.Police circles believe mobile phones of police personnel who were the first to reach the bungalow might hold vital clues to the case. The police brass have already taken the devices in custody and while going through the contents, will also look at the possible destruction of footage and messages; especially with regard to the mystery woman in a car.Sources said it is also being probed whether a portion of cash was moved from the judge’s residence on the night of fire. “The entire cash pile was not gutted, only a portion of it was burnt,” said a source.The developments will be brought to the notice of the three-judge inquiry panel. The panel is learnt to have recorded the statement of Delhi Fire Services director Atul Garg. His statement was recorded at Haryana guesthouse in Chanakyapuri, where the inquiry committee has set up a camp office. Committee members reportedly sought details of the incident and procedures followed by fire department during investigation. Garg is also learnt to have told the committee that he never made a statement in the media that no cash was found during the firefighting operation.Around 11.15pm on March 14, a fire broke out at the storeroom of the judge’s house. According to the incident report prepared by fire department, cops and firefighters remained there for around two hours, though it was a minor fire.The judge’s personal assistant had informed police and fire departments about the incident by making a PCR call. On receiving information, five policemen from Tughlaq Road police station inspected the storeroom and made videos on their mobile. A special CP-rank officer asked the first responders to deposit their mobile phones.On Wednesday, Delhi Police had sealed the storeroom at Justice Varma’s residence and also conducted a videography of the campus, 12 days after a fire broke out there and a cash pile was gutted. Police have also obtained footage from CCTV cameras in the vicinity as part of probe into allegations of foul play levelled by Varma.

KASGANJ: There is little trace of either relief or joy in a remote village of marginal labourers some 60km from Kasganj town, now at the centre of a Supreme Court observation that followed an Allahabad high court order which said a child’s breasts being groped over clothing and drawstrings of her pyjama being broken did not amount to attempt to rape.When TOI visited the survivor’s village on Thursday, the atmosphere was tense and anxiety palpable. The team was met on a link road outside the village by Satbir, 34, the survivor’s uncle. “Don’t stop the vehicle, or I might be in trouble,” he said as he scrambled in. His concern, he explained, came from repeated threats and harassment the family had faced. “My niece was molested on this very road. Since then, we’ve been abused, threatened at gunpoint, and targeted with casteist slurs. Even after the (Supreme Court) stay, I know there will be repercussions.”In the nondescript hamlet of about 200 families, everyone knows about the “chhoti bachchi” who was molested and nearly raped. There is no hiding. “We are under perpetual threat. They have come to our home many times, warning us to withdraw the case,” Satbir added.The accused, he said, belonged to influential families and had licensed firearms. In the village, home to poor families who mostly work as marginal farmers owning less than a bigha of land, pushing back against such power was fraught with risk — pursuing justice meant more than legal struggle. It meant daily fear and economic collapse.The girl has for now moved out of the village. Her parents, Satbir’s brother Samar and his wife, are in Delhi working through the legal paperwork after SC’s intervention. “She is not safe here. We sent her to her maternal grandparents,” a relative whispered.Satbir’s father, 70, sat outside his thatched house — a cramped, four-foot-high structure with a rusting asbestos roof that traps heat in summer — staring blankly at his palms. “I don’t fully understand what Supreme Court has said,” he muttered. “But I was told what the high court did. If courts cannot protect the honour of our girls, then who will?”The family has borrowed Rs 2.5 lakh from private lenders to sustain the legal fight. “We have no way to repay this debt. Look at our homes, look at our lives,” the old man said, gesturing at the rusted roofs and dark interiors. They said they could not have reached this point without support from Saroj Chauhan, a local activist. “This pocket of five villages has Yadavs in the minority. They are often subdued,” Chauhan said.The assault occurred on Nov 10, 2021. The 11-year-old was walking home with her mother when two men known to the family — Pawan Kumar, 25, and Akash Singh, 30, — offered her a lift on their motorbike. The mother agreed. After a short distance, the men stopped near a culvert. “They grabbed my daughter’s breasts. Akash broke the string of her pyjamas. She screamed, which drew the attention of passersby,” her mother said. Later, when she went to confront Pawan, she was threatened with a gun.Police allegedly refused to register an FIR multiple times. The mother then approached the Pocso court. Only after that was a complaint formally accepted. The accused were initially charged under IPC sec 376 (rape) and relevant provisions of the Pocso Act . “The accused then approached HC, which reclassified the offence, ruling that the acts did not amount to rape or attempted rape,” said Ajay Pal Singh, the lawyer representing the girl. “The charges were reduced to aggravated sexual assault under IPC section 354B and section 9(m) of Pocso Act.”(Names of kin changed to protect identity of the minor survivor)","The 11-year-old was walking home with her mother when two men known to the family offered her a lift on their motorbike.

We are grateful to Prime Minister Modi ji for organizing the third generation of the Kashi-Tamil Sangamam in Varanasi. Tamil is one of the oldest languages in India, and its history is as ancient as Sanskrit. Every Indian has respect and reverence for Tamil because many elements of Indian heritage are still alive in the language.

Stalin has raised concerns that the policy gives more importance to Hindi over regional languages, which he believes affects the state's linguistic identity and autonomy. The central government, however, says that NEP encourages multilingualism and allows flexibility in language education.Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan has denied that Hindi is being imposed, saying that states have the freedom to choose their languages under the policy.The dispute grew after the central government withheld Rs 2,152 crore meant for Tamil Nadu’s Samagra Shiksha scheme, citing the state’s refusal to implement NEP.

Dallas could have been a perfect fit, but now Henry is locked in with the Ravens

Baltimore Ravens ’ star running back Derrick Henry has officially sold his Dallas home, but it’s not just a routine real estate transaction—it’s a symbolic farewell to a long-standing dream. Henry, who was once rumored to be eyeing a future with the Dallas Cowboys , sold the property for $1.6 million, falling short of its original asking price. This move marks the final chapter in his connection to Dallas, a city he once hoped to call his permanent NFL home.Henry originally bought the luxurious 4,154-square-foot home in Inwood Park in 2022. Featuring 20-foot ceilings, floor-to-ceiling windows, marble floors, and hardwood flooring, the property was a high-end investment.

What do experts say?

Is there a timeline for lifting the freeze?

What is the broader impact of this policy?

The Trump administration has paused the processing of certain green card applications, escalating concerns among Indian immigrants—one of the largest migrant groups in the United States. The decision is part of a broader immigration crackdown aimed at increasing scrutiny and national security checks.According to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the pause aligns with two executive orders signed by Donald Trump. These orders aim to increase immigrant screening for potential fraud, public safety, and national security risks.The freeze affects immigrants applying for permanent residency, including Indian nationals, who form one of the largest immigrant groups in the US. With over 2.9 million Indian immigrants in the country as of 2023, many could face significant delays and legal uncertainties.Laura Collins, director at the Bush Institute-SMU Economic Growth Initiative, told NBC News, “All these people who are approved to remain in the United States have already passed government scrutiny.” She argued that further delays are unnecessary.Azadeh Erfani from the National Immigrant Justice Center told Newsweek, “This sweeping and indefinite stop on green card processing is yet another attempt for this administration to baselessly paint all immigrants as a national security risk.”The Trump administration has not provided any timeline for when green card processing will resume, leaving thousands of applicants uncertain about their future.This move aligns with Trump’s larger push to tighten immigration policies, including plans to deport millions of undocumented immigrants. Critics argue the pause unfairly targets legal immigrants and creates further bureaucratic hurdles.","The Trump administration has paused the processing of certain green card applications.

"Fired feds, leaking secrets: How China is exploiting DOGE layoffs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/secretive-chinese-network-doge-musk-and-trump-doge-layoffs/articleshow/119602501.cms,"Why it matters

The justice department recently charged eight Chinese nationals in a sprawling cyber espionage campaign — a small piece of what the FBI has long warned is the most expansive hacking program on the planet.

Beijing’s operations are increasingly stealthy, structured, and synchronized with China's national strategy. Experts now warn that the most dangerous cyber activity may not be a viral malware or ransomware attack — but the subtle cultivation of real-world sources within US agencies.

Add to that the wave of mass federal layoffs under Trump’s DOGE initiative, and analysts say China is seizing a rare opportunity to exploit thousands of newly unemployed US officials with security clearances.

The use of job scams to recruit foreign assets isn’t new—nor is it unique to China. The CIA has used similar tactics to try and flip Russian officials, even releasing recruitment videos on dark web forums and Telegram channels.

But China’s efforts are more covert, more prolonged, and now possibly more effective. Holden Triplett, who led FBI offices in Beijing and Moscow, calls the current environment a “recruiter’s dream.”

The target: Fired, frustrated, and in possession of secrets

As per a CNN report, the Chinese campaign is emerging just as the US federal government undergoes an aggressive restructuring. Following Trump’s order to eliminate “waste, bloat, and insularity,” thousands of workers have been cut—many in intelligence, defense, and cybersecurity. Eleven CIA and DNI employees were let go following the shuttering of diversity and equity programs. Others face termination in an ongoing agency-wide reorganization.

Officials within the intelligence community are alarmed. A redacted document from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service states with “high confidence” that foreign adversaries are actively working to recruit these laid-off employees. According to CNN, some of these workers were not even given standard exit briefings that typically include warnings about foreign approaches.

Now, Beijing appears to be exploiting that gap—approaching former officials through seemingly legitimate companies and employment channels.

“It doesn’t take a lot of imagination to see that these cast-aside federal workers with a wealth of institutional knowledge represent staggeringly attractive targets to the intelligence services of our competitors and adversaries,” one US official said.

Between the lines

Some job ads specifically targeted ""recently laid-off US federal employees.""

Addresses listed for these firms often led to empty lots or shell companies.

One employee told Reuters he was paid thousands of dollars to post job listings by two anonymous Chinese contacts named “Eric” and “Will.”

Zoom in

This isn’t just a few phishing emails — it's a systemic campaign.

Platforms: LinkedIn, TikTok, Reddit and Craigslist are being used to find disaffected or recently terminated government workers.

Tactics: Foreign operatives pose as recruiters or consultants. Some ask if applicants are ""open to work,"" then escalate to requests for insider knowledge or referrals.

Targets: Probationary employees (often with less job protection), DEI-related officers terminated by Trump orders, and even undercover CIA recruits.

In a high-profile example from 2020, a Singaporean national named Jun Wei Yeo pleaded guilty in US court to acting as a Chinese agent. He created a fake consulting firm and recruited American sources via job ads, paying them to write intelligence reports — without ever disclosing the client was the Chinese government.

The big picture

Political espionage: The MSS (Ministry of State Security), China’s main foreign intelligence arm, has led high-value operations like Salt Typhoon, which breached nine US telecom firms — exposing officials' calls and texts. Pre-positioning for sabotage: Volt Typhoon, a PLA-linked group, infiltrated power plants, ports, and water facilities across the US and Guam. These are not just probes — they’re laying groundwork for potential wartime disruption. Intellectual property theft: China’s hackers have siphoned blueprints, trade secrets and business strategies from US firms for years. Former NSA chief Keith Alexander once called it “the greatest transfer of wealth in history.” Now, a new frontier is opening: human intelligence, via sophisticated job scams designed to lure freshly terminated federal employees.

What separates China from their peers like Russia, North Korea and Iran”, says Mr Hultquist, is that those states routinely cross the line from espionage to disruption, from spying and reconnaissance to outright sabotage. China has “never pulled the trigger”, he says. Even in American infrastructure networks, China has stopped short of inserting destructive code. “We can see them doing the reconnaissance. We can see them getting into place. They’re not showing us the weapon. An article in the Economist

What they’re saying

Holden Triplett, ex-FBI counterintelligence director: “Employees that feel they have been mistreated by an employer have historically been much more likely to disclose sensitive information.” We may be creating, albeit somewhat unintentionally, the perfect recruitment environment,” Triplett told CNN.

David Aaron, former DOJ prosecutor: “Foreign intelligence services often use job recruitment scams to recruit sources without them even knowing they are working for a foreign government.”

White House spokesperson: Both active and former government employees must recognize the danger these governments pose and the importance of safeguarding government information.”

Chinese Embassy: China respects data privacy and security” and was “unaware of any entities involved in such campaigns.”

The intrigue

What’s next

CIA and Defense officials are quietly reviewing layoff protocols.

Intelligence leaders are urging stronger post-employment exit briefings.

LinkedIn says it's increasing efforts to detect and remove fake recruiters.

. (China is expectedly taking advantage of the recent wave of US federal layoffs. A network linked to Chinese intelligence is using fake job ads, made-up consulting firms, and shell companies to target former government workers. The goal is to trick them into sharing sensitive information—sometimes without even realizing it, a Reuters report claimed.Cybersecurity researchers uncovered the campaign, and US officials have confirmed it. It comes as thousands of federal employees are losing their jobs under the Donald Trump administration’s “Department of Government Efficiency,” or DOGE -- an agency that Elon Musk is heavily involved in and has been described as a close advisor to the president in the day-to-day activities of the department.Many of those being targeted have experience in national security, technology, or intelligence work.As per the Reuters report, China’s strategy is simple: find people who are out of work and vulnerable. The job ads are posted on familiar sites like LinkedIn and Craigslist and often look legitimate. But behind them is a quiet effort to collect secrets from people who used to help protect them.A recent investigation by Reuters and cyber researcher Max Lesser revealed that a network of fake consulting firms, tied digitally to a mysterious Chinese company called Smiao Intelligence, has been actively recruiting former US government workers.The companies involved — like RiverMerge Strategies and Wavemax Innovation — appear legitimate at first glance but are part of a larger web that shares servers, phone numbers, and contact links with Smiao.“What makes this activity significant is that the network seeks to exploit the financial vulnerabilities of former federal workers affected by recent mass layoffs,” said Lesser.The US intelligence community has assessed with “high confidence” that both China and Russia are aggressively targeting these displaced workers, especially those with access to critical infrastructure or national security knowledge.As per a report in the Economist, China’s cyber operations have evolved dramatically over the past decade. What began as noisy hacks from visible Shanghai servers has become a refined intelligence machine with three overlapping goals:China’s hacking ecosystem isn’t limited to government operatives.Chengdu, home to the MSS-linked firm i-Soon, has become a hotbed of cyber talent. The city hosts elite hacking contests like the Tianfu Cup and Wangding Cup, dubbed China’s “cyber Olympics.” Winners’ exploits — like software vulnerabilities — are funneled directly into government databases.A leaked trove from i-Soon revealed operations targeting Nepal’s presidential palace, Taiwanese mapping data, Indian immigration systems, and even Thai intelligence. The documents showed disorganization — but also remarkable ambition and global scope.US agencies are scrambling to blunt the impact:But experts say the damage may already be happening. One former intelligence official warned, “We may be building the perfect storm — cutting loose people with secrets and then hoping no one comes calling.”“This isn’t reality TV,” a former intelligence official told CNN. “There are consequences.”","Experts say China is using job scams to recruit US officials with security clearances. China's operations are increasingly stealthy, structured, and synchronized with China's national strategy. Some of these workers were not even given standard exit briefings that typically include warnings about foreign approaches.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119605847,imgsize-933975,width-400,resizemode-4/119605847.jpg"

“Sharpe can be a restricted free agent if the Nets give him a qualifying offer, which would allow them to match any offers. However, Sharpe may have multiple suitors willing to give him a large enough offer to give Brooklyn pause.”

Why the Los Angeles Lakers make sense

Theare expected to target a young, versatile big man in free agency this summer, and Brooklyn Nets ’ backup centerhas emerged as a potential option. With Sharpe’s steady improvement and a likely crowded market for his services, the Lakers could face competition to secure the 23-year-old’s signature.Day’Ron Sharpe, a 6’9” power forward/center hybrid, is having his best NBA season in 2024-25, posting career highs in points (7.9), rebounds (6.6), assists (1.8), and blocks (0.8) in just 18.1 minutes per game. His efficiency and athleticism make him an appealing target for a Los Angeles Lakers team that needs frontcourt depth behind Luka Doncic and LeBron James The Nets already have a significant investment in starting center Nicolas Claxton ($25.4 million next season), which may limit their willingness to match aggressive offers for Sharpe.As Eric Pincus of Bleacher Report noted,- Financial commitment to Claxton- Sharpe’s rising market value- Potential for a bigger role elsewhereDrafted 29th overall in 2021 out of North Carolina, Sharpe was a McDonald’s All-American at Montverde Academy, a program known for producing NBA talent like Cooper Flagg and Derik Queen. His development over four seasons with the Nets has showcased his potential as a reliable rotation player with room to grow.- Need for a young, athletic big to complement Davis- Cap flexibility to outbid Brooklyn- Opportunity for Sharpe to play a larger roleAlso read: NBA Offseason Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers could sign 7-foot-1 Boston Celtics star forward to bolster squad around Luka-LeBron duo With multiple teams expected to pursue Sharpe, the Los Angeles Lakers will need to act quickly in free agency.

India vs Pakistan: Canadian traveller compares hospitality



Social media reactions on the India vs. Pakistan hospitality debate



Also Read |

India is renowned for its hospitality, encapsulated in the words ‘Atithi Devo Bhava’ (Guest is God). Yet, not everyone finds this to be true. A new viral video with a Canadian tourist has ignited an interesting controversy about the hospitality of India and Pakistan.Nolan Saumure is not a tourist who travels for fun; he is a vlogger who has traveled to many countries, including India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, America, and many more. His wide travel background grants him an extensive viewpoint on how various cultures go about hospitality, and this probably advised his perception.This viral video highlights the differing perceptions of hospitality in India and Pakistan. While some might agree with Saumure's view of Pakistan's very open and welcoming culture, others will claim that India's tourist industry has commercialized its way of hospitality. In the end, this argument encapsulates how hospitality is affected by such elements as culture, tourism, and individuals' personal experiences and thus is a complex area deserving of further study.During an Instagram interview with Instagram user @officialnamour, Canadian traveler Nolan Saumure was requested to comment on how hospitable Pakistan and India were. His matter-of-fact response, as prompt as his decision, had sparked online discussion. When directly asked which of the two countries has better hospitality, Saumure answered: ""Pakistan, obviously.""Saumure's brief reply paved the way for general discussions and arguments on the various social networking sites, mainly between individuals coming from both the nations and otherwise. When Saumure was asked to expound on his reasoning, he outlined his rationale. Hospitality in India, he said, is very transactional-oriented. He alleged that Indians in general perceive foreign guests more as customers who are likely to bring in money, not as guests to be greeted with hospitality. In contrast, he portrayed Pakistanis as hospitable, inviting guests to share meals and even welcome them to their homes.""People in India treat you like a walking ATM,"" Saumure said. ""In Pakistan, people invite you over, feed you, and even ask you to stay overnight."" His analogy is meant to depict an extreme contrast between how hospitality is thought about and practiced in both nations.The video soon became viral, receiving more than 4.4 million views and evoking a variety of responses from both sides of the argument.Various individuals identified with Saumure's view, with one of the Instagram users, an African in Dubai, stating, ""Pakistanis are friendlier than Indian people. Pakistan treats you as a friend, Indians treat you as a complete stranger."" Another user, an Indian, simply stated: ""I agree.""Some viewers provided explanations for the difference in hospitality between India and Pakistan. One commenter posited that India's tourism sector is much bigger and more commercialized, which could result in a more transactional attitude towards foreign guests. Pakistan, on the other hand, has fewer foreign tourists, so each guest feels like a special guest.In contrast, there were critics of Saumure's viewpoint among certain users. One such comment wondered why Indians expect ""princess treatment"" from foreigners, citing the historical context of colonial exploitation and wealth looted from India over centuries. Saumure shot back at this criticism by explaining that his preference for not being harassed has nothing to do with expecting ""princess treatment,"" but merely a desire to feel welcome and at ease.","A viral video highlights the differing perceptions of hospitality in India and Pakistan.
