NEW DELHI: Cabinet on Wednesday approved extension of a national highway project in Andhra Pradesh and two multi-tracking of railway corridors in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, entailing a total investment of more than Rs 7,000 crore to push infrastructure development in the country.While the new four-lane 108-km Badvel-Nellore highway project will improve connectivity to Krishnapatnam port in Andhra, the multi-tracking of railway lines - Ratlam-Nagda and Wardha-Balharshah - will decongest East-West and North-South rail corridors, particularly for trains heading towards Mumbai.Announcing the decisions, I&B minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said the four-lane Badvel-Nellore corridor on NH-67 would be taken up on public private partnership mode. This will provide connectivity to crucial nodes in the three industrial corridors of Andhra Pradesh - Kopparthy node on the Vishakhapatnam-Chennai Industrial Corridor, Orvakal node on Hyderabad-Bengaluru Industrial Corridor and Krishnapatnam node on Chennai-Bengaluru Industrial Corridor. The corridor will reduce the distance to Krishanpatnam port by around 40 km compared to the existing Badvel-Nellore road and cut travel time by an hour.On the railway expansion projects, Vaishnaw said the 3rd and 4th line on the Ratlam-Nagda route and 4th line on the Wardha-Balharshah route, covering four districts in MP and Maharashtra would increase the existing network of Indian Railways. ""Bottlenecks on the Ratlam-Nagda and Wardha-Balharshah routes will be eased, resulting in movement of more passenger trains as the track availability will increase,"" he said.Vaishnaw said projects worth more than Rs 4.5 lakh crore had been approved in the transport and infrastructure sector during the third term of Modi government.","Cabinet approves extension of a national highway project in Andhra Pradesh.

ITR filing FY 2024-25 (AY 2025-26): Deadline to file income tax returns extended from July 31,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/taxation/itr-filing-fy-2025-26-deadline-to-file-income-tax-returns-extended-from-july-31-check-new-date/articleshow/121438210.cms,"ITR Filing 2024-25: 10 Key Updates You Need To Know Before Filing Income Tax Return

Advantage taxpayers

New ITR Forms FY 2024-25

New ITR Filing Deadline FY 2024-25: In a major relief to taxpayers, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has extended the deadline for filing Income Tax Returns (ITRs) for the assessment year 2025–26. Returns originally due by July 31, 2025, can now be filed until September 15, 2025.The extension comes amid significant revisions in ITR forms, ongoing system development, and the need for accurate reflection of TDS credits.""CBDT has decided to extend the due date of filing of ITRs, which are due for filing by 31st July 2025, to 15th September 2025 This extension will provide more time due to significant revisions in ITR forms, system development needs, and TDS credit reflections. This ensures a smoother and more accurate filing experience for everyone. Formal notification will follow."" Income Tax Department, Government of India posted on X.According to CBDT, the notified ITRS for AY 2025-26 have undergone structural and content revisions aimed at simplifying compliance, enhancing transparency, and enabling accurate reporting. These changes have necessitated additional time for system development, integration, and testing of the corresponding utilities.Furthermore, credits arising from TDS statements, due for filing by 31st May 2025, are expected to begin reflecting in early June, limiting the effective window for return filing in the absence of such extension.""In view of the extensive changes introduced in the notified ITRs and considering the time required for system readiness and rollout of Income Tax Return (ITR) utilities for Assessment Year (AY) 2025-26, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has decided to extend the due date for filing returns. Accordingly, to facilitate a smooth and convenient filing experience for taxpayers, it has been decided that the due date for filing of ITRS, originally due on 31st July 2025, is extended to 15th September 2025. "" CBDT release stated.A formal notification reflecting the new deadline will be issued separately, said V. Rajitha, Commissioner of Income Tax (Media & Technical Policy) and Official Spokesperson for CBDT.""This extension is expected to mitigate the concerns raised by stakeholders and provide adequate time for compliance, thereby ensuring the integrity and accuracy of the return filing process."" CBDT added.Parizad Sirwalla, Partner and Head, Global Mobility Services, Tax, KPMG in India tells TOI, “Changes in the tax law in the past year and additional disclosure as well as other updates to the tax return form for Financial Year (FY) 2024-25 have necessitated additional time for updating the technology for the tax department. This will entail revising the tax filing utility on the income tax portal as well. Hence, extending the deadline to file the income tax returns for FY 24-25 by almost one and a half months from 31 July 2025 to 15 September 2025 is in line with the expectations. This extension aims to enhance the taxpayer experience by providing requisite time to file returns once the TDS credits are appropriately reflecting in taxpayers Form 26AS and AIS/ TIS following the submission of TDS statements by employers/ deductors of TDS due by May 31, 2025.“Nonetheless, it is in the taxpayers' best interest to file their returns as soon as the filing utility is made available to avoid additional interest costs where tax payments are due or to allow department time to process the returns at the earliest where refunds are due,” she adds.Sonu Iyer, Partner and National Leader, People Advisory Services-Tax, EY India explains, “The ITR forms notified for the FY 2024-25 (AY 2025-26) incorporate the amendments introduced by the Finance Act 2024 and have enhanced reporting requirements relating to deductions being claimed, requirement to report TDS section codes, provide the bifurcation of capital gains for pre and post 23 July 2024, etc. If you recall, Finance Act 2024 has rationalized capital gains taxation on specific transactions on or after 23 July 2024. ”“Given the requirements of these new ITR forms, the e-filing utility (both online and offline) needs to be updated by the Government. Therefore, it is a very welcome move from the government to extend the ITR filing deadline from 31 July 2025 to 15 Sep 2025, allowing taxpayers the time required to comply with these enhanced reporting requirements and legislative changes,” she adds.As per CA Ashish Niraj, Partner at A S N & Company, Chartered Accountants: “This extension was very much awaited by Income Tax professionals and taxpayers, as the Income Tax portal had not yet enabled the filing of ITRs on its portal till May 27, 2025. Normally, July 31 is due date for the category of taxpayers whose accounts are not required to be audited. As the due date was approaching, professionals and taxpayers were tense about how they would prepare and file returns in such a short span of time once the portal allowed ITR filing. There were issues in fetching proper AIS data and TDS data in some cases. All these are required to be reconciled to file error-free returns. Even AIS is not getting fetched properly in many cases. Now that the ITR due date has been extended, taxpayers will get enough time to prepare returns, compare with AIS, 26AS, etc., to avoid mismatches and file them accurately. It’s really a welcome decision.”Meanwhile, the Income Tax Department has notified all seven ITR forms for AY 2025–26, incorporating structural updates and simplifications. ITR-1 (Sahaj) is meant for resident individuals with income up to Rs 50 lakh from salary, one house property, other sources (like interest), and agricultural income up to Rs 5,000. A key update now allows salaried individuals to report long-term capital gains (LTCG) up to Rs 1.25 lakh under ITR-1, which was earlier not permitted.ITR-2 applies to individuals and Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs) who do not have income from business or profession but have income from capital gains. A new requirement mandates reporting capital gains separately based on whether they arose before or after July 23, 2024, due to changes in LTCG tax treatment introduced in the 2024 Union Budget.ITR-3 is for individuals and HUFs with income from business or profession. It now features an increased reporting threshold under Schedule AL (Assets and Liabilities)—from Rs 50 lakh to Rs 1 crore—reducing compliance for middle-income taxpayers.ITR-4 (Sugam) is designed for individuals, HUFs, and firms (excluding LLPs) with total income up to Rs 50 lakh who opt for presumptive taxation under sections 44AD, 44ADA, or 44AE. It too now permits reporting of LTCG up to Rs 1.25 lakh, providing relief to small taxpayers with limited capital gains.ITR-5 is meant for firms, LLPs, AOPs, BOIs, and co-operative societies, while ITR-6 is applicable to companies, excluding those claiming exemption under section 11. Both these forms include changes in the capital gains schedule in line with the revised tax rules post-July 2024.Lastly, ITR-7 is for trusts and charitable institutions required to file returns under sections 139(4A), 139(4B), 139(4C), and 139(4D).","The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has extended the deadline for filing Income Tax Returns (ITRs) for the assessment year 2025–26. Returns originally due by July 31, 2025, can now be filed until September 15, 2025.

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Gaurav Gogoi on Wednesday refuted Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma 's allegations regarding his British wife Elizabeth Colburn's alleged connection with Pakistan’s ISI, calling it the “plot of a C-grade Bollywood movie.”In his first public statement on the matter, Gogoi clarified that his wife spent only one year in Pakistan in 2013 while working on an international project focused on climate change in South Asia.“About 14–15 years ago, my wife — a well-known expert in public policy — was involved in an international initiative addressing climate change in South Asia. As part of that work, she spent a year in Pakistan and then came to India in 2012–13, where she has been working ever since. In 2015, she took up a new job,” the Congress leader said.“I accompanied her in 2013, about 12 years ago. The chief minister is trying to turn this into a C-grade Bollywood movie with a so-called release date of September 10. This story is bound to be a complete flop. The people of Assam are already aware of the truth,” he added.Gogoi also raised questions about the timing and intent behind the allegations.“Our counter-question is this: if, according to these accusations, my wife or I committed any wrongdoing or illegal act, then who has been in power for the last 11–12 years? What have the central agencies been doing all this time? Everyone knows the level of scrutiny involved when someone crosses a national border — whether entering or exiting,” Gogoi said.“As a leader of the opposition who speaks boldly and openly in Parliament, my biodata is known to everyone,” he added.Reacting to Gogoi’s remarks, chief minister Sarma welcomed the Congress MP’s “admission” and claimed that credible evidence supports allegations of Gogoi's ties with the Pakistani establishment.“Finally, Congress MP Shri Gaurav Gogoi has admitted that he visited Pakistan. But let us be very clear — this is just the beginning, not the end,” Sarma wrote on X.“What lies ahead is far more serious. There exists every reasonable ground, supported by credible inputs and documented information, to suggest that Shri Gogoi has maintained proximity with the Pakistani establishment. The Government of Assam, committed to transparency and accountability, will make everything public on September 10, once the Special Investigation Team (SIT) concludes its comprehensive inquiry. The people of Assam and the nation deserve the truth — and they shall have it in full,” he added.“But the people will also not forget — nor forgive — the Congress party and Shri Rahul Gandhi for deliberately promoting such a dangerous and compromised individual into the public life of our country,"" Sarma added.During a press conference, later in the day, Sarma claimed that Gogoi is a ""Pakistani agent"" and his wife maintain close ties with its establishment.""Whatever he (Gaurav Gogoi) has revealed is only 10 per cent. He and his wife are deeply involved in anti-India activities. His son was born in India and later got British citizenship. He surrendered his son's Indian passport there are very serious allegations. I have documents to prove his wife's involvement in collecting Indian Intelligence input. I will reveal details on September 10,"" Sarma said.""The entire point was to dethrone Bhupen Borah. He (Gogoi) could have admitted that before his appointment. He is very smart. He knows that he has to admit. So, he admitted after taking the appointment letter as a Congress president. But today also he made a very wrong statement. His Pakistan visit had nothing to do with his wife. That was an independent visit with the approval of Interior Department of Pakistan. This is about national security, about Bharat. This has nothing to do with elections. His wife was snooping on our IB. I have documents to prove that. It was all because of taking advantage of Tarun Gogoi's position. They crafted their role within Indian establishment. It was snooping on behalf of a particular climate activist group,"" he added.This come days after Sarma alleged that Gogoi visited Pakistan on the “ISI’s invitation” and worked closely with the establishment.Sarma had claimed, “Gaurav Gogoi visited Pakistan on an invitation from the ISI. This is the first time I’m publicly stating this. We have documents to support it. He did not go there for tourism. He went there to receive training.”He added that Gogoi, who is the deputy leader of Congress in the Lok Sabha, traveled on a direct invitation from the Pakistani government, calling the visit “dangerous.”“He was working closely with the Pakistan establishment. When does a Home Department issue an invitation? Only to impart training,” Sarma asserted. “An invitation from the foreign affairs department or a university is an entirely different matter. This was not from the foreign ministry or cultural department. He went on a direct invitation from Pakistan’s Home Department,” he claimed.","Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma claims Gaurav Gogoi is a ""Pakistani agent"" and his wife maintain close ties with its establishment.

Poll Should India collaborate with international partners for the AMCA project? Yes, it can enhance technology sharing No, we should develop independently

NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday green-lighted the 'Made in India' fighter jet programme to produce a fifth-generation stealth fighter jet, the advanced medium combat aircraft (AMCA).India has been working on the ambitious AMCA project to develop a medium-weight, deep-penetration fighter jet with advanced stealth capabilities to bolster its air power.The AMCA, along with the Tejas Light Combat Aircraft (LCA), is expected to form the backbone of the Indian Air Force (IAF) in the coming decades.""In a significant push towards enhancing India's indigenous defence capabilities and fostering a robust domestic aerospace industrial ecosystem, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh has approved the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA) Programme Execution Model,"" the ministry of defence said.The ministry added that private sector companies are invited to participate in the project.""They can bid either independently or as a joint venture or as consortia. The entity/bidder should be an Indian company compliant with the laws and regulations of the country,"" the ministry said in a statement.The development also comes amid heightened tensions with Pakistan following Operation Sindoor which claimed over 100 terrorists.The government has focused on enhancing India’s air power, especially in light of China's rapid advancements in the domain.Meanwhile, China now accounts for over 80% of Pakistan's arms imports.A recent US intelligence report claimed that Pakistan is the ""primary recipient"" of China’s economic and military generosity and foreign materials and technology supporting Pakistan's armed forces are very likely acquired primarily from suppliers in China.""Foreign materials and technology supporting Pakistan’s WMD programs are very likely acquired primarily from suppliers in China, and sometimes are transshipped through Hong Kong, Singapore, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates. However, terrorist attacks targeting Chinese workers who support China Pakistan Economic Corridor projects has emerged as a point of friction between the countries; seven Chinese nationals were killed in Pakistan in 2024,"" it added.Also read: Why India is fighting a Pakistan armed by China ""Pakistan primarily is a recipient of China’s economic and military largesse, and Pakistani forces conduct multiple combined military exercises every year with China’s PLA, including a new air exercise completed in November 2024,"" the report said.Last year, the Cabinet Committee on Security, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, granted in-principle approval to the AMCA programme. The indigenous fifth-generation fighter jet project is expected to play a pivotal role in strengthening the IAF’s combat capabilities.The estimated development cost of the AMCA project stands at approximately Rs 15,000 crore.The IAF has long advocated for the AMCA programme, given its long-term strategic requirements and the absence of a fifth-generation fighter jet in its current fleet. In contrast, China has already inducted its Chengdu J-20 jets, which it claims to be fifth-generation air superiority fighters with precision strike capabilities.India’s confidence in the AMCA initiative received a major boost following the successful development of the LCA Tejas.Developed by state-run Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), the Tejas has proven to be a capable platform for air combat and offensive missions, with secondary roles in reconnaissance and anti-ship operations.Meanwhile, the IAF is also in the process of acquiring 114 Multi-Role Fighter Aircraft (MRFA) to enhance its operational readiness. In April 2019, the IAF issued a Request for Information (RFI) for the procurement, estimated at around USD 18 billion. The MRFA deal is considered one of the largest military procurement programmes globally in recent years.","India has been working on the ambitious AMCA project to develop a medium-weight, deep-penetration fighter jet with advanced stealth capabilities.

Which is the law that gives you the right to have such a regiment?

NEW DELHI: The Centre on Wednesday raised the MSP for paddy by 3% (Rs 69) to Rs 2,369 per quintal, even as it placed special focus on pulses, oilseeds and coarse grains (nutri-cereals), hiking their MSP by 6%, 9% and nearly 14%, respectively, for the 2025-26 kharif marketing season.The move is in sync with government's growing focus on cultivation of crops other than water-guzzling paddy. It wants to promote crop diversification and encourage cultivation of climate-resilient and water-efficient crops like nutri-cereals. The highest absolute increase in MSP over the previous year has, accordingly, been recommended for niger seed (Rs 820 per quintal), followed by ragi (Rs 596 per quintal), cotton (Rs 589 per quintal) and sesamum (Rs 579 per quintal).""We have taken care that on all the crops farmers receive at least 50% margin on their base cost,"" said information and broadcasting minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, noting that the total MSP hike is estimated to be worth Rs 2.07 lakh crore.The expected margin for farmers over their cost of production is estimated to be the highest for bajra (63%) followed by maize (59%), tur (59%) and urad (53%). For the rest of the crops, the margin for farmers is estimated at 50%.The Cabinet approved the hike ahead of the beginning of the kharif sowing season, given the arrival of the monsoon in many parts of the country.",The move is in sync with government's growing focus on cultivation of crops other than water-guzzling paddy.

RAIPUR: Once synonymous with the rise of Maoist insurgency, Bastar, along with Kondagaon, have been removed from the list of Left Wing Extremism (LWE)-affected districts by Union home ministry, marking a turning point in Chhattisgarh's mission against Naxalism.This comes a week after Maoist general secretary Basavaraju was gunned down, along with 27 other Maoists, in neighbouring Narayanpur district. Bastar had been on the LWE-affected districts' list for at least 25 years.Bastar and Kondagaon have now been sub-categorised as 'districts of legacy and thrust', which means Maoist activities have come down to a great extent. Bastar range IG P Sundarraj told TOI, ""Kondagaon and Bastar are among 30 districts across the country now brought under 'districts of legacy and thrust' category. This removes them from the category of LWE-affected regions but they need development and vigilance on the operational front. ""Other districts of Bastar division - Sukma, Bijapur, Narayanpur and Kanker - are still categorised as 'most affected LWE districts' while Dantewada features among 'other LWE districts'.Dhamtari, Kabirdham, Khairagarh-Chhuikhadan-Gandai and Rajnandgaon have also been sub-categorised under 'legacy and thrust districts'.Bastar and Kondagaon were once counted among the hotbeds of Maoist insurgency, but incidents of violence have dropped significantly in recent years. The lone encounter in Kondagaon in nearly five years was on April 16 when two senior Maoist commanders were gunned down.Both districts saw good voting in the 2023 assembly polls - Bastar 84.6% and Kondagaon 81.7%.In the recent notification issued by MHA, 18 districts in the country are identified as 'LWE-affected', 'other LWE-affected' or 'districts of concern', including six in Chhattisgarh.""Due to effective anti-Naxal operations in recent months, we have seen remarkably positive outcomes in the LWE scenario in Bastar Range. Categorisation of Kondagaon and Bastar as 'districts of legacy' is a significant step closer to being 'Maoist-free'. All our efforts would now be focused on ensuring that Naxal menace is totally eliminated in Bastar Range,"" Sundarraj said.","Bastar and Kondagaon have now been sub-categorised as 'districts of legacy and thrust' This comes a week after Maoist general secretary Basavaraju was gunned down, along with 27 other Maoists, in neighbouring Narayanpur district.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121474027,imgsize-711834,width-400,resizemode-4/121474027.jpg"

US-China tech tensions 'escalate'



Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has publicly praised President Donald Trump while sharply criticising the Biden administration ’s export controls on artificial intelligence (AI) chips to China, calling the policy 'a failure' that cost US companies billions. Speaking at the Computex 2025 tech conference in Taipei, Huang applauded Trump’s plan to roll back the Biden-era AI export restrictions, saying the prior policy was based on “fundamentally flawed” assumptions.“President Trump realises it’s exactly the wrong goal,” Huang said, referencing the Biden administration’s approach that blocked exports to China entirely and categorised countries into three tiers, news agency Reuters reported.Trump officials are now considering replacing that system with a global licensing regime aimed at preserving US leverage in trade talks.Under the Biden rules, Huang said Nvidia’s share of the Chinese AI market plummeted from 95% to 50%, while Chinese firms like Huawei capitalised, accelerating the country’s domestic semiconductor industry.“All in all, the export control was a failure,” Huang stated.“The assumptions that led to the AI diffusion rule have been proven to be fundamentally flawed,” he added.Despite US efforts to slow Chinese AI development, Huang noted that research there continues at scale, powered by massive domestic investment. He estimated China’s AI market could hit $50 billion in 2025—representing a critical opportunity for Nvidia, if re-entry is allowed.“The competition in China is really intense. They would love for us never to go back,” Huang added.Nvidia has already taken a $5.5 billion hit due to the chip restrictions and projects an additional $15 billion in revenue loss related to its restricted H20 AI chips . The company is now designing a version of its next-generation Blackwell chip with slower memory to comply with current rules.Earlier this week, Beijing slammed Washington for what it called “discriminatory” measures after US authorities warned firms against using Chinese chips like Huawei’s Ascend.","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang blasts Biden-era AI chip export policy.

Billionaire investor Mark Cuban has said that he is not impressed with the design choices of Tesla. Speaking at ""Your Mom's House"" podcast in March, he was asked ‘what's your favorite car?’. Cuban, who owns a Tesla replied with a grin “A Kia. EV6.” He further added “I like it. I'm comfortable with it.”Revealing that he hasn’t sold his Tesla ‘yet’, Mark Cuban explained: “On the Tesla you've got to find [the turn signal] and push the button… while you're driving. You can't pay attention to the road as much.”Praising Kia, he said: “It doesn't try to be too fancy. Your turn signal is like… a turn signal”.While Mark Cuban doesn’t mind driving a ‘cheaper’ Kia EV6, but his 15-year-old son isn’t impressed. When Cuban suggested handing down the car for driving practice, his son quickly shut it down, saying, “It’s not cool, Dad.” He even called it a “nerd car.” Cuban’s response? “Exactly,” he said, embracing the label.Mark Cuban is a known Elon Musk critic. Earlier this year on the ""Club Shay Shay"" podcast, Cuban admitted that he likes provoking Musk because he has ""really thin skin and it just makes it easy.""In another interview earlier this year, Cuban said “I have no problem throwing Elon under the bus, but I'll save it for when it's truly deserved.”Last year, when Musk encouraged users to share more positive content on X, Cuban wasted no time in delivering a sharp retort. “Please post a bit more positive, beautiful or informative content on this platform,” the Tesla CEO then wrote. Cuban commented “You first”.Cuban recently shared an anecdote from a night at COMDEX, which he claims was a major tech trade show in Las Vegas, where he found himself upstaged by none other than Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. At this event, Cuban recalled chatting with a group of women when they suddenly disappeared, only to learn they had left with Gates, who had just taken Microsoft public and was quickly becoming a tech icon. Cuban noted jokingly that Bill Gates took away “his girls.”During the podcast (Cue: 24.29), when asked about a business competition that keeps him up at night, Cuban shared the story about him and Bill Gates in Las Vegas. Cuban said, “I'll tell you a story about in Vegas back in the day about Bill Gates. This is way back, it used to be like the biggest trade show in the world was called Comdex. It was a technology trade show, and it was like 125,000 people here, and I started my company when I was 26, 27, right along this. So, I just thought I was a bada**, right?

India’s biggest brain drain isn’t to Silicon Valley. It’s to the scroll.

Yes, I believe the next wave of global entrepreneurs will come from India

I have put my money on it

But we’re ALSO building the largest army of thumb warriors - overstimulated, under-inspired people, who're weirdly okay with it.

A billion screens.

A billion brains.

And what do most do with them?

Watch prank videos, swipe choreographed dances, and overdose on AI-generated “wisdom” like it’s roti-sabzi.

We didn’t evolve with media like the West did.

Radio → TV → Cable → Internet

We leapfrogged straight to Reels. And then fell right in

Even my 7-year-old starts with Peppa Pig and ends up in a vortex of glitchy animation and algorithmic chaos.

TikTok, Insta & YT did their job — they captured attention and monetized it.

But what did we lose in the process?

Teens that don’t talk.

Adults that don’t think - just scroll.

With AI, the stimulation will only intensify.

Opportunity?

Dystopia? Also

Feels like a ‘Black Mirror’ episode no one signed up for

This isn’t a call to delete Social apps. It’s not even a solution.

It’s a rant from a concerned father.

And maybe, a conversation about our children.

Curious to hear from other parents, professionals, educators, and entrepreneurs

What are you doing about this?

And how do we make sure the India we’re building doesn’t forget to look up?

Shark Tank India judge Anupam Mittal recently started a debate on social media addiction . In a long LinkedIn post, Mittal said that India’s biggest brain drain isn’t talent leaving for Silicon Valley, but rather millions of minds lost to mindless scrolling. Mittal also expressed his concern over the digital consumption habits of Indians. He said that while the country is moving towards producing the next wave of global entrepreneurs , it is also building an army of overstimulated and under-inspired individuals. A billion screens.

He shared a personal anecdote about his 7-year-old, who starts watching Peppa Pig but ends up in a glitchy vortex of algorithm-driven content.With AI intensifying digital stimulation, Anupam Mittal warned that India is raising a generation that doesn’t play, teens that don’t talk, and adults that don’t think—just scroll. “Feels like a ‘Black Mirror’ episode no one signed up for,” he remarked.💪🏼🤷🏼😵‍💫","Shark Tank India judge Anupam Mittal recently started a debate on social media addiction.

Khan Sir's real name still unconfirmed

With a surprise but touching declaration, popular educator Khan Sir, the popular online learning platform, and the unique teaching method, announced that he had recently married. This disclosure, shared through a private video message addressed to his students, instantly became a sensation on social media and academia. While his fame is widespread, his wedding ceremony remained low-key, consistent with Khan Sir's long-standing policy on personal life: quiet and dignified.Being true to his nature, Khan Sir decided to break the news of his marriage to the same people who form the core of his existence—his students. In a video message, he informed his students:This act underscores the teacher-student relationship that Khan Sir has nurtured over the years. His ascendance to national fame has been primarily fueled by his capacity to identify with students from varied backgrounds, especially those who are appearing for competitive tests in India. By informing them first, he again reaffirmed the pivotal position that they hold in his life and career.According to ET reports, Khan Sir has organised two functions to celebrate his marriage:The decision to host a student-exclusive feast is another indication of how deeply he values his educational community. Invitations for both events have been shared digitally, and sources close to the educator confirm that the celebrations will remain modest and controlled in scale, reflecting Khan Sir’s personal values.The date of the wedding had already been finalized, as per Khan Sir. Nonetheless, the wedding ceremony itself was made deliberately low-key in light of increased tensions.Though the public is curious, Khan Sir has not disclosed anything about his wife. All that has been heard is her name inscribed on the wedding invitation card: A. S. Khan. No pictures or more information about her has been released to the public.This is consistent with the established modus operandi of Khan Sir to protect his personal life. Although he is one of the most seen teachers in India online, he has always made a distinction between his professional and personal persona.The marriage announcement has been received with a blend of excitement and wonder by his fans. His fans and students have filled social media with congratulatory remarks. However, as curiosity grows, most of his fans will not force him to let go of private details. This response says it all about the trust and respect Khan Sir has earned. His audience appears to love his authenticity, and many have mentioned that his personal decisions only serve to further his reputation as a humble, down-to-earth teacher.There has been speculation for years regarding the actual name of Khan Sir. Though it is speculated to be Faisal Khan by many, the educator has not made any official confirmation or denial of this either. The wedding card also did not mention his full name, keeping up with the mystery.This deliberate decision not to share his complete identity could be due to his intent to keep the spotlight strictly on education and content, rather than individual fame. His audience so far has been supportive of this strategy.","Khan Sir, an Indian YouTube teacher, shares wedding news first with students.

4 new Apple stores confirmed for Delhi, Mumbai, Pune and Bengaluru!

President Donald Trump seems quite not-so-happy with Apple's decision to make in India. The US President Donald Trump announced that Apple can build factories in India but will face a 25% tariff on products sold in the US if manufactured overseas. Speaking in the White House Oval Office during the signing of executive orders on nuclear energy, Trump referenced a discussion with Apple CEO Tim Cook , stating, ""I had an understanding with Tim that he wouldn’t be doing this. He said he’s going to India to build plants. I said, ‘That’s okay, but you’re not going to sell into here without tariffs.’""Trump stressed, ""We’re talking about the iPhone. If they’re going to sell it in America, I want it to be built in the United States."" Initially singling out Apple, he later broadened the tariff threat to include all smartphone manufacturers, such as Samsung and Huawei, saying, ""It would be anybody that makes that product, otherwise it wouldn’t be fair."" The tariffs are slated to take effect by the end of June 2025.Earlier in a social media post on the same day, Trump doubled down, writing, ""I expect their iPhones that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else. If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25 per cent must be paid by Apple to the US. American jobs come first!""During a recent trip to Doha, Trump had pressed Cook to focus on US manufacturing , noting India’s high tariffs make it a difficult market for US companies. He added, ""They’ve offered us a deal where they’re willing to charge us no tariff, but I told Tim, ‘I don’t want you building in India. Build here.’"" The US President highlighted that India’s tariff policies, among the highest globally, complicate market access, but he insisted on prioritizing domestic production.Apple CEO Tim Cook, addressing tariffs during Apple’s Q2 2025 earnings call, noted that they are determined by the product’s manufacturing location. Industry experts caution that relocating iPhone production to the US would sharply increase costs due to higher labor and operational expenses. If Apple passes these costs to consumers to maintain profit margins, iPhone prices could soar to $3,000 or more, potentially impacting demand. Analysts also point out that building a US-based supply chain would require significant investment and time, given the complex global network Apple currently relies on, primarily in Asia.The policy has sparked debate, with some economists warning that tariffs could raise consumer prices and disrupt global trade, while supporters argue it could boost US manufacturing jobs. The White House has not yet clarified how the tariffs will be implemented or whether exemptions might apply for companies investing in US facilities.In a related news, Apple CEO Tim Cook reportedly declined offer to join tech exectuives and representatives at Trump's recent trip to the Middle East. The choice appeared to irritate Mr. Trump, said a New York Times report.","US President Donald Trump said Apple can build factories in India but will face a 25% tariff on products sold in the US if manufactured overseas.

California avocado growers say Mexican imports have helped their sales,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/california-avocado-growers-say-mexican-imports-have-helped-their-sales/articleshow/121479219.cms,"Image: AP





SOMIS: Andreas Tompros lost his home and at least a third of his avocado orchard to a wildfire last year, but the 47-year-old grower is not worried about his farm making a comeback.While California farmers often rattle off a list of challenges they face including high labor costs, water restrictions and overseas competition, many avocado growers say they have a good thing going. A key reason may come as a surprise to some - Mexican imports.When the United States lifted its ban on Mexican avocados in 1997, California growers worried at first that the imported fruit would displace their production.But the steady flow of avocados has wound up helping, not hurting, their sales by allowing for a year-round supply to markets and restaurants that has fomented demand, farmers say. Before the influx, most American consumers considered avocados to be specialty items - and when they came into season in California, industry officials had to work to rev up widespread interest in order to sell them.But not anymore.Avocado consumption has been booming in the United States over the past two decades. The amount of fruit available per person tripled to more than 8 pounds (3.6 kilograms) between 2000 and 2021, federal statistics show. Avocado toast and guacamole are regular offerings not just in culinary hubs like NYC but at cafes around the Midwest and the South.Avocados are in demand On a steep, sun-soaked hillside northwest of Los Angeles, Tompros is replanting nearly 300 avocado trees with the belief that Americans' hunger for the fruit - and his orchard - will continue to grow.""It will come back, and I believe it will become better than it was,"" Tompros, who previously ran a software company in Hollywood, said of the orchard he took over five years ago in the tiny community of Somis.Avocado demand has also been buoyed by consumers' growing interest in healthy fats, said Emiliano Escobedo, executive director of the Hass Avocado Board.A 2000 US law created the board that collected 2.5 cents for every pound (0.5 kilograms) of avocados imported or produced in the United States. The board used the money to market avocados and conduct nutritional research, an effort that has been widely credited with making the fruit ubiquitous in supermarkets and on restaurant menus.""It's been really wildly successful. It generates way more money than most of these other industry boards do,"" said Richard Sexton, distinguished professor of agricultural and resource economics at the University of California, Davis. ""When you look at the growth rate in avocado consumption relative to all fruits, the difference in growth rate is dramatic.""A successful crop Escobedo said about 60% of US households currently buy avocados, and about half of these are responsible for the overwhelming majority of consumption, which means there's still room for the market to grow - especially in the Northeast, where the fruit is less common.""There is a lot of opportunity for certain groups of people to increase their purchasing of avocados,"" Escobedo said.While the Trump administration has threatened tariffs on a spate of Mexican goods, avocados have so far been spared. California growers said they want Mexican avocados to keep flowing into the country, though they also want robust US inspections of the imports to keep out pests to protect their crop.""If you are going to farm in California, avocados are about the best deal right now,"" said Ken Melban, president of the California Avocado Commission.California farmers grow about 10% of the avocados eaten in the United States, Melban said, and account for nearly all of the country's domestic avocado production. The fruit is largely grown in California from April through September, and Mexican imports arrive year-round to meet nationwide demand, which exceeds what the state's farmers grow, he said.In Southern California's Ventura County, many growers have shifted to avocados since lemon prices were walloped by cheaper imports from Argentina. As recently planted trees start bearing fruit in a few years, the region's avocado production is likely to rise, said Korinne Bell, agricultural commissioner for the county northwest of Los Angeles.A booming market, despite wildfires Avocado trees do not come without risks in a region prone to wildfires.Still, demand for the trees has jumped due to interest from lemon growers - and since the November 2024 fire charred Ventura County avocado orchards, said Rob Brokaw, whose family-owned nursery has supplied avocado trees to California growers for 70 years.""Right now we are sold out essentially for this year,"" Brokaw said. ""And we're mostly sold out for 2026.""Tompros debated whether to plant the more fire-resistant lemon trees or another crop after the fire ripped through Somis, but he decided to replant due to the soaring demand for Super Bowl guacamole and avocado toast.""It's the super food, and it's still growing in popularity,"" Tompros said.He's taking precautions to not plant the trees too close to what will eventually be his rebuilt home, because the dried-out leaves that help nourish the orchard's soil can also fuel blazes.It may take a few years, but Tompros hopes it won't be too long before his newly planted trees bear fruit that he can sell to a local packinghouse or in seasonal gift boxes with citrus and passionfruit that he ships directly to customers.",Avocado consumption has been booming in the U.S. over the past two decades.

HONG KONG; Asian stocks rallied with US futures Thursday after a US court blocked Donald Trump's sweeping global tariff blitz, dealing a hefty blow to the president's signature trade policy and providing some much-needed relief.The ruling provided an extra shot in the arm for investors already upbeat after forecast-busting earnings from chip titan Nvidia revived optimism about the tech sector.And while the White House has appealed against the decision, analysts said traders were making the most of the buying opportunity on hopes the levies will not be imposed.After hearing cases brought by businesses and a coalition of state governments, the three-judge Court of International Trade agreed that the president's actions violated the power of the purse given to Congress under the constitution.The White House slammed the ruling by ""unelected judges"".The news revived risk appetite among investors, who remain anxious despite slowly recovering from the shellshock of the president's April 2 ""Liberation Day"" tariffs that fanned fears of a global recession.Markets in Japan and South Korea -- major exporters who faced huge tariffs -- surged more than one percent thanks to rallies in tech firms and auto makers.Seoul was also helped by a central bank interest rate cut.Hong Kong, Shanghai, Sydney, Taipei and Manila were also higher, while the futures for all three main indexes in New York piled on more than one percent each.- 'Market exhaling' -The gains were helped by a rally in tech firms that came after Nvidia reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings, even as it faced increased export controls that it warned could cost it billions in the current quarter.The firm posted a profit of $18.8 billion on revenue of $44.1 billion, and forecast strong sales for the second quarter, thanks to still-booming demand for chips to power artificial intelligence.Stephen Innes at SPI Asset Management said investors extending the Nvidia-fuelled rally showed ""the market exhaling after weeks of white-knuckle volatility sparked by trade war brinkmanship,"" he wrote in a commentary.US judges gave a clear message, Innes said: ""The Oval Office isn't a trading desk, and the Constitution isn't a blank cheque.""The ruling is ""a structural pivot in the narrative: from strongman tariffs to institutional guardrails"", he said.""Executive overreach may finally have found its ceiling. And with it, a fresh dose of macro stability -- at least until the next headline.""The prospect that the worst of the tariffs could be avoided also weighed on safe-haven assets, with gold and the yen retreating.Oil, meanwhile, extended Wednesday's rally that was already underway ahead of an OPEC meeting to discuss output and rising tensions over Russia and Iran.Tokyo - Nikkei 225: UP 1.7 percent at 38,355.70 (break)Hong Kong - Hang Seng Index: UP 0.4 percent at 23,347.38Shanghai - Composite: UP 0.6 percent at 3,359.32Euro/dollar: DOWN at $1.1242 from $1.1291 on WednesdayPound/dollar: DOWN at $1.3430 from $1.3468Dollar/yen: UP at 145.89 yen from 144.82 yenEuro/pound: DOWN at 83.71 pence from 83.84 penceWest Texas Intermediate: UP 1.1 percent at $62.50 per barrelBrent North Sea Crude: UP 1.0 percent at $65.54 per barrelNew York - S&P 500: DOWN 0.6 percent at 5,888.55 (close)London - FTSE 100: DOWN 0.6 percent at 8,726.01 (close)","Asian stocks rallied with US futures Thursday after a US court blocked Donald Trump's sweeping global tariff blitz.

""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job. Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public. Musk has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-96413764,imgsize-26192,width-400,resizemode-4/96413764.jpg"

* Q3 results season starts

* Positive global cues

* China stocks rise

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Delhi Election Results 2025: Why AAP Lost,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhi-election-results-2025-aap-lost-reasons-arvind-kejriwal-new-delhi-manish-sisodia-bjp-modi-incumbency-corruptio-sheesh-mahal-liquor-freebies-congress-rahul/articleshow/118023276.cms,"Here are 10 reasons behind AAP's defeat:



Ten years of incumbency

Liquor scam, Sheesh Mahal dent Kejriwal's 'imandaar' image

No tie-up, Congress did strategic campaigning

Flood of freebies but no next-level of development

BJP focuses on Kejriwal, Hindutva takes back seat

BJP's latent vote

Rahul roasted Kejriwal as payback for Haryana

MCD with AAP: No excuses

Steady exodus of AAP leaders

AAP goes negative

The BJP on Saturday pulled off a major political upset by unseating the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) from Delhi after over 10 years. As per the latest Election Commission data, the BJP may win around 48 seats and the Kejriwal-led party may secure around 22 seats in the 70-seat Assembly.BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a fierce contest from the New Delhi seat by a margin of 4,089 votes. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes.Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.""We accept the mandate of the people with great humility. I congratulate the BJP for this victory and I hope they will fulfil all the promises for which people have voted for them,"" Kejriwal said in a video address posted on X.In the evening as the results were decalred, PM Modi kicked off his victory speech with a powerful chant of ""Yamuna Maiya ki Jai"". PM Modi declared that the people of Delhi were experiencing both relief and joy -- relief from the ""disaster"" (AAP-da governance) and joy in embracing a new era under BJP rule. ""I had written a letter to every Delhi resident, urging them to give the BJP a chance to serve in the 21st century...Today, I bow my head in gratitude to every family in Delhi for trusting us. You have given us love with an open heart, and I assure you that we will return it manifold through rapid development,"" PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also attacked the AAP over allegations of corruption against its leaders, saying that all links of such charges will be probed and those who ""looted"" money will have to return it.With the BJP set to regain control of Delhi after 27 years, what went wrong for the Aam Aadmi Party?After governing Delhi for a decade, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) faced significant anti-incumbency.While AAP achieved impressive results in health and education during its first two terms, and kept voters happy with power and water subsidies, unfulfilled promises, such as improved air quality, became major poll issues.The AAP's assertion that the BJP government at the Centre was creating roadblocks in its functioning began to be increasingly seen by voters as excuses, especially after ten years in power.The BJP's ""double engine"" promise, suggesting seamless governance between the central and state levels, appealed to voters against the backdrop of AAP's constant conflicts with the Centre. Furthermore, internal disarray within the AAP, with senior leaders facing jail time, added to the challenges of incumbency .The image of Arvind Kejriwal as an anti-corruption crusader suffered a setback due to several factors, most notably the controversy surrounding the now-scrapped liquor policy.The BJP accused the AAP government of turning Delhi into a ""city of drunkards"" with the new policy, and receiving crores in kickbacks from those who opened the vends.Probes by central agencies led to the arrest of top AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, and Sanjay Singh. These arrests forced Sisodia to step down as deputy chief minister and kept the AAP in ""firefighting mode"", distracting from fulfilling its 2020 poll promises.Additionally, the ""Sheesh Mahal"" controversy, referring to the renovated residence of the chief minister, further dented Kejriwal's image. The BJP further highlighted a Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report that indicated the renovation cost had increased from an initial estimate of Rs 7.91 crore to Rs 33.66 crore by completion.AAP has been synonymous with Arvind Kejriwal since its inception. Kejriwal, initially seen as an agent of change with his untucked shirt and no-nonsense demeanor, resonated with the common person.However, the anti-corruption image of Kejriwal and his party suffered irreparable damage, specially after the AAP leader's arrest in March 2024 on corruption allegations and his subsequent resignation as CM.While he was later granted bail, the leadership transition to Atishi and the circumstances surrounding Kejriwal's arrest damaged the party's image and cohesion.The absence of an alliance with the Congress party and the Congress's strategic campaigning likely contributed to the AAP's loss.In previous elections, the AAP had significantly reduced the Congress's presence in the Delhi assembly.Attempts to convince Congress workers to collaborate with AAP volunteers reportedly led to an ""existential crisis"" among them.The Congress decided to campaign aggressively against the AAP, sensing ""anger building up against the AAP"". Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attacked the AAP in the final days of the Delhi campaign.The Congress further claimed the AAP did not want an alliance, with Kejriwal announcing all 70 candidates early on.The rise of AAP in Delhi has been congruous with the decline of the Congress. In 2013, AAP won 28 seats with a 29.49% vote share, while the Congress tally decreased to 8 seats from 43 in 2008. In 2015, Congress suffered a 15% decline in its vote share, while the AAP saw its support base rise by around 15%.While AAP's welfare schemes, such as free electricity and bus travel for women, initially garnered support, a lack of focus on infrastructure development and maintenance became a significant issue.The poor condition of roads and sewers across Delhi angered voters.Overflowing drains, potholed roads, and irregular garbage collection contributed to the party's unpopularity.The AAP's control over the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) meant it could not deflect blame for these issues onto the BJP. Voters in middle- and upper-middle-class areas were particularly affected by the deteriorating infrastructure.AAP's origins trace back to Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption movement, positioning the party as an alternative to the Congress in 2013.While AAP secured mandates in 2015 and 2020, their repeated promises and ""freebies"" seem to have lost their appeal.The promise of piped water connections for all in 2015 remains unfulfilled, as does the promise of full statehood for Delhi and the ""Rozgar Budget"" aimed at creating 20 lakh jobs.Kejriwal himself admitted that he had failed to fulfill three promises: cleaning the Yamuna, providing clean drinking water, and upgrading Delhi's roads. This acknowledgment gave the BJP an opportunity to attack the AAP, with Amit Shah mocking Kejriwal's promise to purify the Yamuna.The BJP's campaign strategy focused primarily on targeting Arvind Kejriwal and his government, rather than emphasising Hindutva, as it has often done during campainging in other state elections as well as previous Delhi polls.This approach likely resonated with a broader segment of the population, including those who may not have been inclined to support a religiously charged campaign. By focusing on issues such as corruption and governance, the BJP effectively undermined AAP's credibility and appealed to a wider range of voters.The BJP also focused on hyper-local issues such as air pollution, traffic, and public safety, and engaged with local Resident Welfare Associations. They also promoted central government schemes.The BJP also targeted specific demographics, including Purvanchalis and slum dwellers, and utilised an aggressive digital campaign with AI-enhanced content and memes targeting AAP.The BJP's consistent performance in the Lok Sabha polls in Delhi indicated a latent voter base that the party successfully mobilised this time around for the assembly elections.Despite AAP's strong performance in the assembly elections, the BJP had consistently swept Lok Sabha elections in the national capital, winning all seven seats.This pre-existing support base provided a foundation for the BJP's campaign and likely contributed to their victory.The BJP also strategically fielded Parvesh Verma, a strong Jat leader, in the New Delhi constituency, signaling their intention to win back the confidence of the Jat community, which had previously favoured AAP in Delhi elections.During the Delhi Assembly elections, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched strong criticisms against Arvind Kejriwal, which may have been payback for events in Haryana. Gandhi's attacks covered a range of issues, including alleged corruption, unfulfilled promises, and inaction on key issues.Like the BJP, Gandhi attacked Kejriwal over the alleged liquor scam and accused him of living in a ""Sheesh Mahal"" while engaging in corrupt practices.Gandhi said that Kejriwal made false promises, ""similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi"", particularly regarding cleaning the Yamuna River. He also challenged Kejriwal to drink Delhi's tap water, implying it was still polluted despite promises to clean it.The Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) win in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) in 2022 proved to be a double-edged sword, ultimately hurting the party instead of helping it. AAP had promised a cleaner city with world-class roads, but it fell short on both accounts. The MCD House was in limbo, and the Standing Committee, which controls all financial powers, was never formed. The AAP repeatedly accused the Centre of creating hurdles through the Lieutenant Governor and stalling projects.This time around, voters held the AAP accountable for the deteriorating civic infrastructure across Delhi.AAP's performance in the MCD was a letdown for the people of Delhi. The party failed to address critical issues such as clearing garbage, repairing roads, and cleaning clogged sewers. Erratic water supply and overflowing sewers that were never repaired because Rs 4,000 crore for the Delhi Jal Board was not released further hurt the party.Senior party leaders stated that the MCD functioning had collapsed under the AAP, and no work was being done, leading to frustration among councillors.The steady departure of senior leaders from AAP over time might have also weakened the party's organisational structure and public image.The exit of prominent figures like Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Mayank Gandhi, and Kumar Vishwas, who had dared to disagree with Arvind Kejriwal, and repeatedly accused Kejriwal of having an ""autocratic"" style of leadership.Resignation of senior leaders like Kailash Gahlot, who cited the party's focus on political agenda over fulfilling promises, along with internal challenges, signalled internal discord.The BJP had termed Gahlot's resignation a ""courageous move"".Negative campaigning by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) centered on issues like Yamuna River pollution, the Delhi Police, and the Election Commission (EC) may have affected public perception of the AAP government.In the lead up to the polls, Kejriwal accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna River, which supplies drinking water to Delhi. He claimed that the Haryana government deliberately sent polluted waters to Delhi to create an artificial water scarcity and blame the AAP.The AAP also repeatedly levelled accusations of voter fraud and irregularities against the BJP as well as the EC.AAP alleged that the Election Commission and Delhi Police were shielding BJP workers and accused them of ""hooliganism"". Kejriwal wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner, expressing concern over the intimidation and harassment of AAP volunteers by BJP workers. The EC responded that no written complaints could be traced in most cases but assured that all registered complaints are investigated.Kejriwal further criticised the Election Commission for allegedly refusing to make Form 17C public, a document detailing the number of votes polled at each booth. AAP then launched a website, transparentelections.in, claiming to upload Form 17C data for all constituencies to present the data in an accessible format.The EC dismissed Kejriwal's claims regarding Form 17C, stating that copies had already been provided to polling agents at each booth after voting, as per Rule 49S of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.","BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes.

The race to become Africa's next ""super banker"" ends on Thursday, with five candidates, including one woman, vying to succeed Nigeria's Akinwumi Adesina as head of the African Development Bank (AfDB) in a contest that appears too close to call.In 2015 it took six rounds of voting to elect Adesina as president of the AfDB, which was founded in 1964 and now has 81 members, including 54 African nations.Based in Ivory Coast's economic capital Abidjan, the AfDB is one of the world's largest multilateral development banks, and is funded by member subscriptions, loans raised on global markets as well as repayments and income from loans.But Adesina's successor will immediately face a disrupted international economic environment, notably due to announcements from the US Trump administration.Beyond tariffs, the AfDB is also facing the threat of losing 500 million dollars in US funding for its projects to support low income countries on the continent.Two of the five candidates are from west Africa -- former finance ministers Amadou Hott of Senegal and Sidi Ould Tah of Mauritania.Two others hail from southern Africa -- Zambian economist Samuel Munzele Maimbo and South African Bajabulile Swazi Tshabalala, who was previously a vice president at the institution.Chadian Abbas Mahamat Tolli, the former governor of the Bank of Central African States, will represent central Africa, which has never held the AfDB presidency.All five promise to make the AfDB even more effective to transform Africa, continuing Adesina's five priorities to light up, feed, industrialise, integrate and improve quality of life.""I am proud of the legacy we are leaving behind for... my successor, for the bank, and for Africa,"" the outgoing president said in a speech on Tuesday.""We have built a world-class financial institution that will continue to advance Africa's position within a rapidly changing global development and geopolitical environment.""Adesina said 565 million people had benefited from AfDB projects during his decade in charge.Major projects include support for the construction of the Gabal El Asfar wastewater treatment plant in Egypt -- the largest in Africa.The bank also helped finance a bridge connecting Senegal and the Gambia, expanded the port of Lome in Togo, and supported sanitation projects in Lesotho and access to electricity in Kenya, he said.From 2015 to this year, the bank's capital more than tripled from $93 billion to $318 billion, he added.To win Thursday's election, candidates must secure a majority of votes from all member countries and a majority of votes from African nations.But the weight of each shareholder state is determined by the extent of its capital contribution to the bank.As such, the five largest African contributors -- Nigeria, Egypt, Algeria, South Africa, and Morocco -- will be especially courted.The United States and Japan are the largest non-regional contributors.If there is no winner in the first round, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, a situation that repeats until a candidate achieves the required majority.Alliance-building will therefore be crucial on Thursday, in the corridors of the Hotel Ivoire in Abidjan.","Five candidates, including one woman, vying to succeed Nigeria's Akinwumi Adesina as head of the African Development Bank.

Rededicating focus to core companies





Billionaire Elon Musk has announced that his tenure as a formal adviser to President Donald Trump is coming to an end, raising questions about the future of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initiative he led.In a post on X, his social media platform, Musk expressed gratitude to Trump for the opportunity to address government spending inefficiencies.“As my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President @realDonaldTrump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending,” Musk posted on X. “The @DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government.”The most straightforward explanation lies in the statutory limitations of Musk's role as a Special Government Employee. These positions are legally restricted to 130 days of service within a 365-day period, with Musk's term scheduled to conclude around late May 2025. This arrangement was always intended to be temporary and advisory in nature, rather than a permanent executive position with direct decision-making authority.The position's inherent time constraints made this transition inevitable, regardless of other factors.A significant catalyst for Musk's departure appears to be his public opposition to Trump's signature legislation.Just one day before his announcement, Musk openly criticised what the president dubbed his ""big beautiful bill,"" describing it as a ""massive spending bill"" that would expand the federal deficit.This legislation, combining tax cuts with enhanced immigration enforcement measures, stood in direct opposition to DOGE's core mission of reducing government spending and waste. During a CBS interview, Musk pointedly remarked, ""I think a bill can be big or it could be beautiful, but I don't know if it could be both."" This fundamental disagreement over fiscal policy created an untenable situation for his continued advisory role.While speaking to CBS, Musk described it as a “massive spending bill” that increases the federal deficit and “undermines the work” of DOGE.Musk's experience with federal bureaucracy proved far more challenging than he initially anticipated. In various public statements, he expressed growing frustration with the pace of change and institutional resistance within Washington.Speaking to the Washington Post, Musk described the situation as ""much worse than I realized"" and characterised his reform efforts as an ""uphill battle.""The challenges extended beyond mere administrative hurdles, as DOGE became a lightning rod for criticism, often being blamed for various government-related issues, even those outside its purview. This mounting pressure affected not only the initiative but also Musk's other business ventures, with some protesters even targeting Tesla vehicles.The gap between DOGE's ambitious targets and actual achievements likely contributed to Musk's decision.Initially promising $2 trillion in savings, the target was subsequently revised downward to $1 trillion, and then further to $150 billion. While DOGE implemented aggressive budget cuts and workforce reductions, the results fell significantly short of original expectations.The department aimed to reduce the civilian workforce by 12% (approximately 288,000 positions from the 2.4 million total), but achieved only about 100,000 reductions through buyouts and terminations - a figure lower than typical annual retirement numbers. The DOGE website's reported savings of $175 billion, while substantial, represented just a fraction of the initial goals.Musk's decision also reflects a strategic pivot back to his corporate interests, particularly Tesla, which has faced recent challenges in sales and profitability. During a Tesla earnings call, Musk announced plans to significantly reduce his time commitment to DOGE starting in May, indicating his intention to dedicate more attention to his business ventures.This shift comes as Tesla navigates through declining profits and revenues, complicated by political uncertainties and tariff concerns. The company has also faced challenges related to Musk's political involvement, with some consumers and activists targeting Tesla in response to his government role.Throughout his tenure, Musk maintained that his position as ""chief nothing officer"" was not essential to DOGE's mission. However, his departure raises questions about the initiative's future direction and effectiveness.",Billionaire Elon Musk has announced that his tenure as a formal adviser to President Donald Trump is coming to an end.

The Trump administration has slashed $766 million allocated in funding to Moderna Inc., an American biotech and pharmaceutical company responsible for developing vaccines. Moderna was tasked to make vaccines against potential pandemic influenza viruses, as well as the H5N1 bird flu.The Health and Human Services Department had notified the company on Monday about the withdrawal of funds that were awarded through the BARDA (Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority) program.HHS is withdrawing funds awarded in January and July this year, intended to finance the development and purchase of the company’s investigational vaccine.Moderna had received $590 million in January and $176 million in July in funding meant to help judge the efficacy of the vaccines for bird flu and other pandemic viruses, as said by a company Spokesperson.Health secretary Robert F. Kennedy has expressed his concerns regarding the company’s vaccines despite evidence that vaccines developed by Moderna are safe and have saved millions of lives before.“While the termination of funding from HHS adds uncertainty, we are pleased by the robust immune response and safety profile observed in this interim analysis,"" said the company in a statement as reported by AP.Using the same technology used to develop and roll out vaccines during the Covid-19 pandemic, Moderna has developed a new vaccine called mRNA-1018.On the other hand, a new, highly contagious variant of Covid-19 has surfaced in the US known as NB. 1.81. Initially detected in late March and early April among international travelers, cases have since been identified in New York, Ohio, California, Rhode Island, Hawaii, Washington State, and Virginia.Last year, the H5N1 bird flu virus spilled from wild birds into cattle and ended up infecting hundreds of animals across several states. 70 people reported sick with the flu, and one person died.Scientists have warned that continued alteration or evolution in the virus can make it more potent and ultimately lead to a pandemic.","The Trump administration has slashed $766 million allocated in funding to Moderna Inc., an American biotech and pharmaceutical company.

16 states sue Trump over $1.4 billion in cuts to National Science Foundation grants,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/16-states-sue-trump-over-1-4-billion-in-cuts-to-national-science-foundation-grants/articleshow/121477182.cms,"New York attorney general Letitia James (Image credits: AP)





16 states, mostly controlled by Democrats, filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration on Wednesday, asking a federal court to block major funding cuts and program changes at the National Science Foundation (NSF). The states argued that the moves threaten the United States' leadership in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM).The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, is led by New York attorney general Letitia James. “This administration's attacks on basic science and essential efforts to ensure diversity in STEM will weaken our economy and our national security,” she said.According to the lawsuit, the NSF has begun ending programs that support the participation of women, minorities, and people with disabilities in STEM fields.It also challenges a new rule that limits funding for indirect research costs, such as lab space and equipment, to 15 per cent of total grants. The lawsuit claims these actions go against long-standing Congressional goals, reported The New York Times.The NSF has supported broader participation in STEM since 1980, under direction from Congress. The foundation recently changed its policy priorities, removing support for diversity, equity, and inclusion programs.Days after the grant cancellations began, NSF director Sethuraman Panchanathan announced his resignation.As of Wednesday, more than 1,700 NSF research grants had been cancelled, totaling about $1.4 billion in cuts. One example in the lawsuit says the State University of New York could lose $18 million as a result.The NSF had a $9 billion budget for fiscal year 2024, but the Trump administration’s draft budget proposes cutting it by 55.8 per cent.In addition to New York, the other states joining the lawsuit include California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington, and Wisconsin.","16 states, mostly controlled by Democrats, filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration on Wednesday.

'It's called negotiation': Trump denies 'chickening out' on tariffs when asked about TACO trade,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/its-called-negotiation-trump-denies-chickening-out-on-tariffs-when-asked-about-taco-trade/articleshow/121474522.cms,"



US President Donald Trump has hit back at claims of regularly taking a step back on tariff threats, insisting that his moves are part of a strategic negotiation process rather than weakness.Trump took particular offence to the suggestion that he backs down after dramatic tariff announcements, a pattern known as the “TACO” trade, short for Trump Always Chickens Out, was coined by the Financial Times’ Robert Armstrong.Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Trump was visibly annoyed when asked about the nickname, rejecting the idea outright.“You call that chickening out? It’s called negotiation,” he said, adding that he sets a “ridiculous high number and I go down a little bit, you know, a little bit.”The president defended his tactic of announcing steep import taxes, such as a 145 per cent tariff on Chinese goods, only to later reduce the figure, as happened recently when the rate was cut to 30 per cent during a 90-day negotiation window.A similar move came just last week, when Trump threatened a 50 per cent tariff on goods from the European Union starting in June, only to delay the increase to July 9. For now, the baseline 10 per cent tariff remains in place while talks continue.This strategy has become a hallmark of Trump’s trade approach, with similar episodes unfolding around cars, electronics and even his broad tariffs announced on 2 April, which were partially based on individual trade deficits with other nations.Each announcement has sent markets reeling, with stocks typically dipping on the threat of tariffs before recovering when Trump eases off. The S&P 500 index, for instance, fell as much as 15 per cent earlier this year before clawing back gains and was up slightly as of Wednesday afternoon.Despite the market swings and scepticism from economists, Trump claimed his methods have driven investment, saying they’ve led to $14 trillion in new investment in the United States, a figure that has yet to be fully backed by official data.“Don’t ever say what you said,” Trump warned the reporter who raised the “chickening out” claim.“To me, that’s the nastiest question.”He also argued that the EU wouldn’t be coming to the negotiating table without his aggressive stance, saying, that he usually have the opposite problem of being ""too tough.”","US President Donald Trump has hit back at claims of regularly taking a step back on tariff threats.
