How India built safety net for skies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-india-built-safety-net-for-skies/articleshow/123554834.cms,"QRSAM: First Layer In IADWS

How a modern IADS works

The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) on Aug 23 successfully carried out the maiden flight-tests of the Integrated Air Defence Weapon System (IADWS). Held off the coast of Odisha, the test validated the country's first fully indigenous multi-layered air defence shield.During the demonstration, IADWS engaged and destroyed three aerial targets simultaneously - two high-speed fixed-wing UAVs and a multi-copter drone. The targets were neutralised at varying altitudes and ranges, proving the system's versatility against different airborne threats.The system integrates three indigenously developed technologies - Quick Reaction Surface-to-Air Missiles (QRSAM), Very-Short Range Air Defence System (VSHORADS) missiles, and a high-power laser-based Directed Energy Weapon (DEW). Together, they create a layered shield capable of countering everything from low-flying drones to high-speed aircraft and missiles.Control of all components is exercised through a Centralised Command and Control Centre, developed by the Defence Research & Development Laboratory (DRDL). This ensures radars, communication networks, missile batteries, and directed-energy weapons function in unison, maximising reaction time and accuracy.At the heart of IADWS is the QRSAM, providing frontline protection to Army units on the move. Mounted on 8x8 high-mobility vehicles, it allows ""fire-on-the-move"" capability. Its dual-radar system - the Active Array Battery Surveillance Radar and Active Array Battery Multifunction Radar - provides 360-degree detection, tracking, and targeting of multiple threats. With a strike envelope of 25-30km and altitudes up to 10km, QRSAM can intercept aircraft, helicopters, drones, and missiles with precision.By filling the gap between man-portable short-range systems and long-range missile defences like the S-400, QRSAM forms the mobile first layer of the IADWS shield.Complementing QRSAM are the VSHORADS and DEW. VSHORADS, developed by DRDO's Research Centre Imarat, is a man-portable missile designed for low-altitude threats. Lightweight and field-deployable, it adds agility and flexibility to the IADWS framework.The most futuristic element is DEW. In April, DRDO showcased its 30-kilowatt laser against drones, helicopters, and missiles at ranges up to 3.5km. With 360-degree electro-optical sensors and jamming features, DEW marks India's entry into 'Star Wars'-style defence.DRDO chief Samir V Kamat said: ""This is just the beginning... We are also working on high-energy microwaves and electromagnetic pulses that will give us Star Wars capability.""Together, QRSAM, VSHORADS, and DEW provide India with a robust, multi-dimensional defence system.Tailored For Regional ThreatsGlobally, nations such as Russia, China, and Iran have developed sophisticated Integrated Air Defence Systems (IADS) to counter US airpower. These systems force US operations farther out to avoid detection. They link radars, mobile command posts, and space-based sensors to create a distributed, networked shield. Russia's S-400 is among the toughest, with radars reaching 400km and missiles of similar range. Though rarely fired to maximum distance, this capability enables flexible engagement within the given range. The challenge lies in neutralising not a single sensor or missile, but an interconnected web. India's IADWS mirrors this philosophy, tailored for regional threats.The IADWS test comes a few days after the successful trial of the Agni-V ballistic missile on Aug 20. It also draws lessons from Operation Sindoor in May, when India's multi-layered defences thwarted Turkish-origin drones and Chinese-supplied missiles used by Pakistan. The operation reinforced the need for homegrown systems tested in live combat scenarios.This renewed focus on indigenisation underlines a wider shift in India's defence ecosystem. From Operation Sindoor to the IADWS test, the pattern is clear: India is preparing to fight future wars with indigenous technologies.In his Red Fort speech on Aug 15, PM Modi urged Indian innovators and the domestic defence industry to develop jet engines indigenously - a technological gap that continues to haunt India's aerospace sector. Despite breakthroughs in missiles and radars, India still depends on foreign suppliers for engines, holding back projects like the Tejas fighter and AMCA stealth aircraft.While a HAL-GE joint venture is reportedly being discussed and the long-delayed Kaveri engine remains incomplete despite over Rs 2,000 crore invested, India's vulnerability in propulsion contrasts with its advances in air defence.This prolonged dependence on foreign jet engines, particularly from the US, France, and Russia, highlights a major vulnerability. While India has made breakthroughs in missiles, radars, and air-defence systems, its inability to master jet engine technology continues to hold back flagship projects like the Tejas fighter and the AMCA stealth aircraft. By situating the QRSAM success within this broader narrative, India's defence roadmap reflects both its recent achievements and the challenges that remain.","The Integrated Air Defence Weapon System (IADWS) is India's first fully indigenous multi-layered air defence shield.

NEW DELHI: The sentiment for a boycott of the joint parliamentary committee (JPC) on the bill on dismissal of jailed ministers is growing, with Communist Party of India (CPI) on Tuesday saying that the parliamentary panels are a sham and serve no purpose under BJP govt. The CPI stance after boycott decision by four opposition parties will increase the pressure on Congress to follow suit.CPI MP Sandosh Kumar said the JPC on Waqf bill has proven lucidly that such panels are just an attempt to show collective scrutiny of the bill when they are actually an eyewash. “There was a time when members on the JPC could summon documents, scrutinise details and then make contributions. Now, the opposition’s suggestions are rejected out of hand. The JPC on Waqf bill is an example. It is of no value,” he told TOI .While the Left parties don’t have the strength to be in the parliamentary panels and depend on the govt’s goodwill to find a place in them, the CPI opinion carries weight since it could be seen as representative of other smaller Left constituents.The sentiment of an integral part of the opposition INDIA bloc follows announcements by TMC, Samajwadi Party, Sena UBT and AAP that they will not participate in the JPC that is being formed to scrutinise the controversial bills, including the constitutional amendment.The offensive from the bigger INDIA bloc parties has forced Congress to take a relook at its inclination to join the proposed JPC in the interest of opposition unity. There is regret in Congress that compulsion of unity may nudge the party into following the cue of TMC-SP-Shiv Sena, arguing it will result in complications for the future, as well as when the three controversial bills come up in the parliament for discussion.Many key INDIA bloc parties like DMK, NCP (SP) and CPM have not spoken out yet, since they seem to be waiting for Congress to take a final decision. A Left outfit MP said no party would want to stand alone on the issue that will be viewed as a test of unity of the bloc.This has triggered speculation that a complete opposition boycott of the JPC is possible. While this marks a major division in the anti-BJP ranks, for a change it is not a split that ends up favouring BJP, but one of competitive hostility to the govt’s initiative. “We have to know how far we should go, because these are important issues where some points have to be put on record,” a pro-JPC MP said.",CPI MP Sandosh Kumar said the JPC on Waqf bill has proven lucidly that such panels are just an attempt to show collective scrutiny of the bill when they are actually an eyewash.

NEW DELHI: Air Chief Marshal A P Singh on Tuesday cautioned against rushing the rollout of theatre commands, stressing that India must adopt its own model instead of copying others. He suggested setting up a joint planning and coordination centre in Delhi, under the Chiefs of Staff Committee, to prepare for ""future wars.""Speaking at the Army War College, the Chief of Air Staff, cautioned against rushing into the creation of new theatre commands, warning that creating a new structure while disrupting everything is not a very good idea at this point of time.Instead, he proposed setting up a joint planning and coordination centre in Delhi, placed under the Chiefs of Staff Committee, to issue directions jointly saying, ""I personally feel that having a joint planning and coordination centre in Delhi is what is required.""Responding to questions on the proposed theatre commands, Singh said, ""yes, we can start with this first, implement it and see how it pans out. If we need any more structure, we can think about it. But disrupting everything and making one structure now at this time, I do not think it is a very good idea.""The Air Chief Marshal's remarks came three-and-a-half months after Operation Sindoor, which showcased strong coordination among the Army, Navy and Air Force.Citing the recent Operation Sindoor, a tri-service simulation held from May 7 to 10 against Pakistan, Singh underlined how the three service chiefs worked closely in planning and execution.The exercise, he said, reinforced both the primacy of air power and the value of coordination. He further noted that ""centrally planned"" decisions could still be executed in a decentralised framework, which in his view ""will work out the best.""He also cautioned against blindly following international models saying India should not be inspired by any other country, like the US, in rolling out theatre commands, stressing that the nation must design a framework suited to its own requirements.""Everybody has their own requirements. We need to think about what we need there, and then only we should go about it. Otherwise, we will go wrong,"" he said.""We should not just come under any pressure and say we have to implement it now. Somehow, we have to do it. It should not be done this way. I think we can stand our ground and discuss things,"" he added.The Air Force chief also underlined the need to focus on preparing for tomorrow's wars, where clarity in the chain of command will be critical.""You cannot have a theatre commander sitting somewhere... now whom they talk to, where do they get directions from. Phones are available but generally that does not work like that,"" he said.""I feel having joint planning and coordination at the apex level is what is required. If directions go from it, things will work out. We don't actually need another structure at the lower level,"" Singh added.The government’s proposed theaterisation model aims to bring the three services under unified commands to better integrate capabilities and use resources more effectively.Under the plan, each theatre command would combine units of the Army, Navy and Air Force to handle security challenges in a specific region. Currently, the three services operate under separate commands.","Air Chief Marshal A P Singh says India must adopt its own model instead of copying others.

Who was Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)?

The UAE has officially declared a public holiday for government employees to mark the birth anniversary of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), which falls on Friday, September 5, 2025, according to the Islamic (Hijri) calendar.As this year’s observance coincides with a Friday, UAE residents may benefit from a long weekend (Friday to Sunday), providing a time for spiritual reflection and rest.The Islamic calendar follows the lunar cycle, and key religious dates, such as the Prophet’s birthday, are determined by the sighting of the new moon.On Saturday, August 23, 2025, the International Astronomy Center in the UAE confirmed that the crescent moon marking the start of Rabi Al Awwal (the third month of the Islamic calendar) was not sighted anywhere in the Arab world.Due to this, the 12th of Rabi Al Awwal— the date traditionally recognised as the Prophet Muhammad’s birthday— will be observed on Friday, September 5, 2025, in the UAE and several other countries.The 12th day of Rabi Al Awwal holds profound significance in Islam as it commemorates the birth of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). Across the Muslim world, this day is marked with prayers, religious lectures, and community gatherings that celebrate the Prophet’s life, character, and teachings.It is a moment to reflect on the Prophet’s message of compassion, justice, and unity, which remains central to the Islamic faith.Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is regarded as the final messenger of Islam, following prophets such as Abraham, Moses, and Jesus. He was born in Mecca in the year 570 CE, known as the Year of the Elephant, and passed away in 632 CE in Medina.Throughout his life, the Prophet played a transformative role— not only as a spiritual leader but also as a unifier and reformer of Arabian society. His teachings, preserved in the Qur'an and Hadith, form the foundation of Islamic belief and practice, continuing to influence over a billion Muslims worldwide","The UAE has declared a public holiday on Friday, September 5, 2025, for Prophet Muhammad’s (PBUH) birthday.

SSC Recruitment Scam: Massive Protest In Kolkata, Police Detains Protesting Teachers Amid Scuffles

Poll What is your opinion on the switch from TCS to Eduquity as the exam conducting agency? A positive change A negative change

NEW DELHI: Amid protests over glitches and irregularities in the conduct of computer-based govt recruitment examinations by the Staff Selection Commission (SSC), SSC chairman S Gopalakrishnan on Monday assured that the “technical and operational matters” faced by a few candidates in the first selection post examination on July 24, have been “stabilised” and no major disruptions anticipated in the upcoming exams.Gopalakrishnan said around 5.5 lakh candidates had appeared in the first exam, the first to be held after M/s Eduquity replaced M/s TCS as the exam conducting agency (ECA) in July 2025, with questions being set by other content agencies and delivered digitally from a vault. Some candidates at two of the total 194 centres faced issues due to bugs, like duplication of questions, repeat of same options, etc.“A detailed analysis by CDAC identified about 59,000 candidates affected by system disruptions. They will now retake the exam in three shifts on August 29, 2025,” he said adding that the stenographer exams conducted from Aug 6-8 had witnessed no disruptions. SSC has also rescheduled the Combined Graduate Level (CGL) Exam from August 13 to mid-September.On Congress alleging “rigging” of government recruitment exams under the Modi government and slamming the “brutal lathicharge” on those protesting against it, SSC alleged that the protests, led by coaching institutes, were aimed at protecting business models rather than the genuine interests of candidates.Elaborating on the recent SSC examination reforms, Gopalakrishnan said aadhaar-based authentication at the application level and exam venue has helped prevent impersonation and repeated attempts by candidates to appear in multiple sessions or to take the role of scribes and exam functionaries. Also, deviation from old question patterns had denied the coaching institutes undue advantage. Rather than a single agency like TCS performing all tasks, SSC, has, from July onwards, entrusted different aspects of the examinations to four agencies.Eduquity is now the ECA, even as content agencies set the questions, CDAC handles IT security and detects hacking/malpractices and an independent agency monitors the exams. The idea is that no single agency can hijack or compromise the exams, and to maintain transparency and fairness, according to Gopalakrishnan.He further noted that the content providers, ECA and monitoring agencies are subject to deterrent penalties for any shortcomings in performance.The multiple agency system, it was highlighted, has resulted in certain entities (led by some online tutors or coaching institutes) attributing the initial system hiccups to ECA and demanding that TCS be brought back. Gopalakrishnan however explained that Eduquity was selected through a tender, with TCS listed only at third position in the bid.","SSC chairman S Gopalakrishnan assured that the “technical and operational matters” faced by a few candidates in the first selection post examination on July 24, have been “stabilised” He said no major disruptions anticipated in the upcoming exams.

India to begin testing new long-range interceptor missiles for defence shield next year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-to-begin-testing-new-long-range-interceptor-missiles-for-defence-shield-next-year/articleshow/123536547.cms,"India’s Agni-5 Missile Test Sparks Panic In Pakistan, Raises Global Concerns Over Regional Stability

Poll Which aspect of the Mission Sudarshan Chakra do you find most crucial? Missile defence shield for protection Advanced technology for counter-strikes

NEW DELHI: India will next year begin testing new interceptor missiles for an indigenous air and missile defence shield under Project Kusha, which will be a critical element of the ambitious `Mission Sudarshan Chakra (MSC)’ announced by PM Modi to provide security cover to strategic as well as vital civilian areas in the country by 2035.The plan is to test the M1 missile, with an interception range of 150-km against incoming enemy aircraft, stealth fighters, cruise missiles, drones and precision-guided munitions, in 2026. It will be followed by M2 (250-km range) in 2027 and M3 (350-km range) in 2028 for the missile-based layered defence system being developed by DRDO, top sources told TOI.The aim is to complete the development of these three long-range surface-to-air missiles (LR-SAMs) and related systems under Project Kusha by 2028 to, hopefully, pave the way for their induction from 2030 onwards, the sources added.This fully-automated LR-SAM system, which will rival the expensive Russian-origin S-400 Triumf air defence system deployed by the IAF in limited numbers, will be a part of the overall MSC plan to build a multi-layered integrated air and missile defence shield around key locations.In this, it will be somewhat similar to the proposed `Golden Dome’ missile defence initiative of the US or the deployed Israeli `Iron Dome’, which only has to protect a very small country.It is estimated the expansive Golden Dome, with the capability to also shoot down missiles in space, will cost around $500 billion over the next 20 years.Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan, at the `Ran Samwad’ conclave at Mhow on Tuesday, said he was sure India could build its own “Iron or Golden Dome” under the MSC at “an affordable cost” with a whole-of-nation approach.“It will act both as a shield and sword,” the CDS said, in tune with the PM’s statement that the defence shield will not only thwart aerial threats but also launch counter-strikes to hit the adversary “many times more”.This clearly implies India will go in for a major expansion of its conventional (non-nuclear) arsenal of missiles like Pralay (500-km strike range), BrahMos (increased range from 450-km to 800-km) and land-attack cruise missiles (1,000-km range).Gen Chauhan, on his part, acknowledged the proposed defence shield will require “a colossal amount of integration” of myriad capabilities as well as development of infrastructure and processes for “detection, acquisition and neutralisation of enemy air vectors, using soft and hard kill options, including kinetic and directed energy weapons (like lasers)”.The shield, of course, will require multi-domain ISR (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance) through an overlapping network of early-warning and tracking sensors deployed on land, air, sea, undersea and space.Then, robust land and sea-based batteries of a wide array of short to long range SAM missiles, high-power lasers and other weapons will be needed. Finally, reliable command and control posts to manage the sensors and weapons with an integrated air picture to effectively respond in real-time.A small beginning was made with DRDO’s maiden test of an integrated air defence weapon system (IADWS) on Aug 23. It included quick reaction surface-to-air missiles (QRSAMS, with 30-km interception range), very short-range air defence system (VSHORADS, with 6-km range) missiles and a 30-kilowatt laser-based directed energy weapon (DEW, with 3.5-km range).“Many of the building blocks for the MSC defence shield have either been developed or are being developed. The real challenge will be to integrate them all. It will cost a lot of money for a large country like India,” a source said.A comprehensive defence shield will also include the operational deployment of Phase-I of the indigenous two-tier ballistic missile defence (BMD), which has been developed by DRDO to track and destroy enemy ballistic missiles in the 2,000-km range class, at different altitudes both inside (endo) and outside (exo) the earth's atmosphere for “a higher kill probability”.In July last year, DRDO also successfully flight-tested an endo-atmospheric interceptor missile under Phase-II of the BMD system, with the defence ministry proclaiming it demonstrated the indigenous capability to defend against hostile nuclear-capable missiles in the 5000-km range class.","The plan is to test the M1 missile, with an interception range of 150-km against incoming enemy aircraft, stealth fighters, cruise missiles, drones and precision-guided munitions.

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Wednesday reiterated the need to focus on self-reliance and 'vocal-for-local' while chairing the cabinet meeting. He also said India is ready to face all challenges and asked ministers to encourage and motivate people to buy more 'Made in India' products, TOI has learnt.The PM's remarks gain significance as the US doubled tariffs on many imports from India to 50%. Modi has been consistently promoting 'Made in India' products, and in recent weeks, he has urged traders and shopkeepers to put up boards saying ""swadeshi goods sold here"". 'Swadeshi' should be the 'mantra', and irrespective of who puts in the investment, production must be Indian, Modi had said on Tuesday.Sources said that in a list of suggestions, Modi has urged ministers to spread the message of govt expanding the coverage of PM Svanidhi scheme meant for street vendors so that more people can get the benefit of subsidised loans, and to see that the beneficiaries get specially designed T-shirts so that they can be identified quickly. This will help spread the message of govt's focus on welfare of the poor, they added.PM also asked ministers to hold events of their ministries and departments across the country instead of just hosting them in Delhi so that people know about the activities and schemes undertaken by the Centre. There will be greater focus on holding such events and programmes in poll-bound states. ""Ministers have been advised to see that ministries and departments don't host more than one international event in two years since officials end up spending a lot of time for their preparation,"" said a source.","The PM's remarks gain significance as the US doubled tariffs on many imports from India to 50%.

Singh: We must be ready for unforeseen challenges

NEW DELHI: The Indian armed forces and defence industry must be prepared for all kinds of security challenges from short-duration battles to even a five-year war amid the current unpredictable geopolitical situation, defence minister Rajnath Singh said on Wednesday, citing examples from Operation Sindoor and the long-drawn Russia-Ukraine war.""India has never been a nation that seeks war. We have never initiated aggression against anyone. However, the present geopolitical reality is quite different. Even though we do not harbour any aggressive intent, if someone challenges us, it becomes imperative that we respond with strength. We do not want anybody's land but we are ready to go to any extent to protect our land,"" Singh said, speaking at the 'Ran Samwad' conclave at Mhow. The armed forces and defence industry must remain ready for new innovations. tnnThe armed forces and defence industry must remain ready for unforeseen challenges while mastering existing technologies to stay ahead of the curve to effectively tackle complexities of modern-day warfare that now extends to space and cyberspace, defence minister Rajnath Singh said.Describing Operation Sindoor as a ""striking demonstration"" of technology-driven warfare and ""a great example demonstrating the success"" of indigenous weapons, Singh said, ""Our endeavour must be to define the battlefield and the rules of the game ourselves, compelling the adversary to fight there, so that the lead advantage always remains with us.""The sheer numbers of soldiers or the size of weapon stockpiles are no longer enough because cyberwarfare, artificial intelligence, unmanned aerial vehicles, satellite-based surveillance and real-time intelligence are shaping wars of the future.""Technology is advancing at such a pace that by the time we fully grasp one innovation, another emerges to completely alter the course of warfare,"" he further said.With it also becoming difficult to predict how long a war will last, Singh said it is crucial to continuing strengthening the domestic defence industry. ""If any war stretches for two months, four months, a year, two years, even five years, then we should be fully prepared. We must ensure our surge capacity is sufficient...We have indeed made significant progressbut there is still a long way ahead,"" he said.""What we require today is not just defensive preparedness but also a proactive strategy. Future wars will not merely be battles of weapons; they will be a play of technology, intelligence, economy and diplomacy.

Acting NEW DELHI: Acting on the recommendation the Supreme Court collegium made two days ago, the Centre on Tuesday notified the appointment of Justices Alok Aradhe and Vipul Manubhai Pancholi, chief justices of Bombay and Patna high courts, respectively, as justices of the apex court. The two judges will take oath on Thursday.One collegium member, Justice B V Nagarathna, had given a note of dissent over the choice of Justice Pancholi. The elevation of Justice Pancholi, in line to become CJI in Oct 2031 after the retirement of Justice Joymalya Bagchi, was opposed by Justice Nagarathna, who pointed out that he was 57th in the seniority list and the reasons behind his transfer from Gujarat HC to Patna HC in July 2023 must be looked into.Justice B V Nagarathna also said that Justice Pancholi was from Gujarat HC, which was already represented by Justices J B Pardiwala and Justice N V Anjaria, while underlining the reprimand the CJ of Patna high court got from Justice Vikram Nath.However, the other four members of the collegium - CJI B R Gavai, and Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath and J K Maheshwari - found both Justices Aradhe and Pancholi to be suitable and competent for appointment.Justice Nagarathna had earlier, too, objected to Justice Pancholi's elevation to the apex court in May this year, leading the collegium to defer his name and instead recommend the name of Justice Anjaria.In her two-page dissent note, Justice B V Nagarathna had noted that recommending Justice Pancholi's name for appointment as Supreme Court judge, despite the reasons cited by her, could ""erode whatever credibility the collegium system still holds"".She wanted the collegium to reflect on the July 2023 transfer of Justice Pancholi, which was ""not a routine transfer, but a carefully considered move made after consultations with several senior judges, all of who concurred with the decision"".","Justices Alok Aradhe and Vipul Manubhai Pancholi, chief justices of Bombay and Patna high courts, respectively, will take oath on Thursday.

Oldest living person in the world : Career and international life



Ethel Caterham: The world’s oldest living person witnessing a century of change



Ethel Caterham: Family, lifestyle, and what her longevity inspiring the world



Also Read |

Ethel Caterham, a British centenarian residing in Lightwater, Surrey, has officially become the world’s oldest living person at 116 years old. Born on 21 August 1909, Caterham has lived through some of the most transformative events in modern history, including the Titanic disaster, the Russian Revolution, and both World Wars. She is also the last surviving subject of King Edward VII, representing a living connection to early 20th-century British monarchy. Recognised by King Charles III with a birthday card in 2024, Caterham’s milestone has captured global attention. Her story highlights the remarkable combination of longevity, resilience, and historical perspective, inspiring people worldwide to reflect on the extraordinary possibilities of human life, the evolution of society, and the enduring spirit of individuals who witness over a century of change.Ethel Caterham was born in Shipton Bellinger, Hampshire, as the second youngest of eight siblings. Growing up in a large family in early 20th-century England meant learning responsibility, cooperation, and resilience from an early age. Raised in Tidworth, Wiltshire, she witnessed a rural way of life during a time of social change and industrial expansion. Her childhood coincided with technological advances like the spread of electricity and the automobile, shaping the early experiences of a girl who would live through over a century of innovation.These formative years likely influenced her adaptability and endurance—traits that contribute significantly to longevity and reflect an era where perseverance, community values, and resourcefulness were essential for survival in challenging circumstances.As a teenager, Caterham worked as an au pair in India, an experience that not only broadened her cultural understanding but also introduced her to independence and responsibility at a young age. As reported by BBC, later in life, she moved to Hong Kong and Gibraltar, accompanying her husband Norman, who served as a lieutenant colonel in the British Army. These postings exposed her to diverse climates, cuisines, languages, and social customs, fostering mental agility and adaptability—qualities that studies suggest are linked to longer life expectancy. Living abroad during politically and socially dynamic periods also provided her with firsthand knowledge of global events, enriching her personal and historical perspective.Ethel Caterham’s life spans some of the most significant events of the last century. Born three years before the Titanic sank in 1912, she experienced the societal upheaval of the Russian Revolution in 1917 and lived through both World Wars. As reported, she has witnessed the rise and fall of empires, the advent of commercial aviation, the digital revolution, and major advances in medicine. Caterham’s personal story reflects the resilience and adaptability of individuals living through periods of profound uncertainty and change. Being a living archive of these events, she offers a unique perspective on how human society evolves over time.Caterham’s extraordinary longevity has been officially recognized by the British royal family. King Charles III sent her a birthday card to celebrate her 115th birthday in 2024, a gesture highlighting both her personal achievements and her historical significance. Such recognition is rare and symbolic, connecting Caterham to a lineage that stretches back to King Edward VII. The acknowledgment of her life by the monarchy underscores the cultural and historical importance of longevity and demonstrates society’s admiration for those who live exceptionally long lives.Now living in a care home in Lightwater, Surrey, Caterham enjoys her days surrounded by family and close friends. According to her care home, she prefers to celebrate birthdays quietly, at her own pace, reflecting a peaceful and stress-free lifestyle that research shows can support longevity. Her family has expressed gratitude for the outpouring of public interest and kind messages, emphasizing the role of emotional support, social connection, and family bonding in maintaining mental and physical health in extreme old age.While Caterham is the oldest living person today, the record for the verified oldest human remains with Frenchwoman Jeanne Louise Calment, who lived to 122 years and 164 days. Caterham’s age, however, is still remarkable, placing her among the very few documented centenarians to surpass 115. Her life contributes valuable insights into the factors associated with longevity, including genetics, lifestyle, adaptability, and mental resilience. Researchers studying supercentenarians like Caterham aim to understand how humans can live longer, healthier lives, offering inspiration and guidance for aging populations worldwide.","Ethel Caterham, a British centenarian residing in Lightwater, Surrey, has officially become the world’s oldest living person at 116 years old.

He even pointed to a significant drop in the viewership of Tectone on days when viewbot activities were down, implying his over-reliance on artificial inflation.In his words,He further added,Here 30k denotes live concurrent viewersAs suggested by HasanAbi, the bans offer Tectone a convenient exit strategy. He even speculated that Tectone had found a convenient way to avoid anyof his declining audience. Being suspended, Tectone will be able to frame his absence as a stand against the platform censorship and not the drop in his organic popularity. The perspective added to a new layer on how streamers manipulate the public narrative.A specific trigger for Tectone’s ban is a clip from the August 26, 2025, broadcast. In it, he was seen ranting about online language. The streamer even used a homophobic slurs on Twitch many times, arguing for modern internet online language censorship. He even argued for its return as a common usage.It was claimed by Tectone that without what he calledpeople resort to using much more damaging criminal accusations. In his words,In the now-removed clip, the streamer was also seen telling one of the viewers to kill themselves, before he apologized.The entire justification of Tectone violated the strict guidelines of Twitch against hateful conduct. Acting swiftly, the platform temporarily made Tectone’s channel unavailable shortly after. Following his suspension, Tectone took to X for acknowledging all his actions and calling for equal enforcement of rules against the other streamers, including HasanAbi.The ban incident is not an isolated event for streamer Tectone. The eighth month of the year has not yet ended, and he has already been banned four times previously for violations and some external controversies. His history with the moderations made by Twitch shows a clear pattern of escalating punishments, where every ban lasted a bit longer than the previous one.With Tectone’s channel now temporarily unavailable, the question of his permanent ban looms. Twitch's response has recently been progressively stricter. So, it is possible that this time the platform might take a firm stance on the repeated violations. As of now, Tectone continues his streaming on the other platforms, including YouTube and Kick, wherein his content is facing other and different moderation rules.","John Robertson, aka Tectone, is a popular Twitch streamer. He has been making headlines with his continued ban on Twitch. Now, again, he has found himself suspended from the platform, for the 5th time in 2025. This entire incident sparked many questions and led to intense discussions.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123545453,imgsize-26196,width-400,resizemode-4/123545453.jpg"

Local youths from Kedarnath discovered the remains on Tuesday while exploring the area around the glacier.Among the rocks, they found a decomposed bag, a mobile phone, and an identity card from a Punjab-based private university lying near the bones. Police said the ID card indicated the remains could be of Nomula Rishwanth, 24, a third-year BTech student at Lovely University in Jalandhar, Punjab. He had gone missing in Aug last year while on his way back to college after visiting his family in Rajeshwaraopet village in Jagtial district, Telangana.After seeing him off at Mancherial railway station, the family lost contact with Rishwanth, who was expected to travel from Delhi to Jalandhar.

They may travel to Uttarakhand for this purpose. We cannot come to a conclusion about the identity based solely on an identity card being found.""Anil said police had traced Rishwanth's last phone signal to Uttarakhand during the initial investigation but found no further leads. They had also kept checking his social media accounts, which showed no activity. With no case filed in Uttarakhand and no new evidence, the investigation eventually hit a dead end.The sector officer of Kedarnath said the control room was informed as soon as the discovery was made. The skeletal remains and recovered belongings were then transferred to the district hospital in Rudraprayag for medical examination. ""Forensic tests will help establish the identity. Until then, we cannot say anything conclusively,"" said the officer.

Donald Trump reveals Meta’s AI data centre plan



Mark Zuckerberg bets big on superclusters to drive Meta’s AGI ambitions



US President Donald Trump has announced that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is planning to make a huge investment in AI. Trump confirmed that Meta has made the commitment to spend $50 billion on its new AI data centre. Trump made this announcement during cabinet meeting. As reported by Bloomberg, Trump held an image during the meeting which he claimed was given to him by Mark Zuckerberg. The image shows a data centre superimposed over Manhattan. However, Meta has not officially confirmed the figure. The facility, described as a multi-gigawatt titan cluster, will support the company’s ambitious AI initiatives, including its newly formed Superintelligence Labs division. As part of its broader AI strategy, Meta plans to spend hundreds of billions of dollars over the coming years, reflecting the scale and urgency of its vision.US President Donald Trump described the investment as the “the biggest AI data center in the world.” As per Bloomberg, Donald Trump said, “When they said $50 billion for a plant, I said, ‘What the hell kind of plant is that?’”, holding up a graphic he said was given to him by Mark Zuckerberg. If the $50 billion figure is accurate, then it would dwarf previous infrastructure investments by Meta. Lately, Meta has been expanding its AI research and development, including work on Llama models and custom silicon.Last month, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg confirmed that Meta is building several massive AI compute clusters, each with the energy footprint of a small city. One such facility, Prometheus, will be the company’s first multi-gigawatt data center, while Hyperion is designed to scale up to 5 gigawatts over time.These efforts are intended to support the creation of superintelligent AI systems—machines capable of outperforming humans in a wide range of tasks. To fund this vision, Meta raised its 2025 capital expenditure estimate to between $64 billion and $72 billion. Zuckerberg cited the company’s strong ad revenue, $165 billion last year, as a key enabler of such spending. “We have the capital from our business to do this,” he told investors.","US President Donald Trump has announced that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is planning to make a huge investment in AI.

Online Gaming Bill 2025: What happens to wallet money of PokerBaazi, MPL, Zupee and others

Parliament has passed the Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Bill, 2025 on August 21. The new bill, passed by both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha places a blanket ban on real-money games online. It is designed to curb addiction, financial ruin and social distress caused by predatory gaming platforms that thrive on misleading promises of quick wealth. In 2025 alone, the government has banned multiple betting apps. Majority of these apps banned have allegedly been responsible for promoting unauthorized gambling activities on their platforms. Here’s a look at apps banned in India in 2025Other than these 5 apps, the central government banned around 174 betting and gaming apps in December 2023. Some of the apps on the banned list then were Mahadev, Parimatch, Fairplay, 1XBET, Lotus365, Dafabet, and Betwaysatta.Most companies have confirmed that players’ funds are secure. MPL, Games24x7 (operator of My11Circle), PokerBaazi, and Zupee said withdrawals can be made smoothly, even though fresh deposits are blocked. WinZO said it will remove affected offerings from August 22, while Probo has already discontinued all money-related formats.","Parliament has passed the Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Bill, 2025 on August 21.

Teen prodigy Kairan Quazi is trading rocket science for Wall Street , leaving SpaceX to join billionaire Ken Griffin 's Citadel Securities as a quantitative developer at just 16 years old. The move marks a significant career pivot for the engineering wunderkind who became the youngest SpaceX employee in company history.""After two years at SpaceX, I felt ready to take on new challenges and expand my skill set into a different high-performance environment,"" Quazi told Business Insider. ""Citadel Securities offered a similarly ambitious culture, but also a completely new domain, which is very exciting for me.""Kairan Quazi starts this week at the systematic trading giant's New York City office, where he'll work on global trading infrastructure at the intersection of engineering and quantitative problem-solving, according to Business Insider.Despite receiving offers from leading AI laboratories and major tech companies, Kairan Quazi chose quantitative finance for its unique combination of intellectual challenge and immediate feedback. ""Quant finance offers a pretty rare combination: the complexity and intellectual challenge that AI research also provides, but with a much faster pace,"" he explained to Business Insider.At Citadel Securities, Quazi expects to see measurable impact in days rather than the months or years typical in research environments. The decision represents a notable recruiting win for the trading firm, which competes intensely with AI companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and xAI for top talent.Kairan Quazi's journey began when he skipped from third grade directly to college at age 9. By 10, he was interning at Intel Labs , and at 11, he transferred to Santa Clara University, eventually becoming their youngest graduate in 172 years.SpaceX hired Quazi at 14 to work on production-critical Starlink satellite systems, where he designed software determining satellite beam targeting for millions of customers.

Both Goa and the No.1 state, Sikkim, have a much smaller population than Delhi. Other industrialised states such as Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra are much lower in the list.In absolute GDP, Delhi ranks 11th in India. Its economy is much larger than that of Kerala, Haryana, Bihar, Odisha, Punjab and Assam.Delhi's high income is largely linked to two factors: its skewed share in population and economic activities, and its economy being services-based like advanced countries.In 2011-12, the national capital's share was 3.9% of India's GDP. It rose to 4% in 2013-14 but has now decreased to 3.7%. Despite being a magnet for migrants from all parts of the country, its share in India's population has not increased at a rate that one may assume.In 2011-12, Delhi constituted 1.4% of India's population and today the share is 1.6%, much smaller than its share in GDP.Apart from this, Delhi's economy is like the advanced economies of western Europe and America. In 2011-12, the share of agricultural activities or the primary sector was 3.5% in its economy, which has now reduced to less than 1%.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

NEW DELHI: Democrats on the US House Foreign Affairs Committee on Thursday slammed President Donald Trump’s decision to impose a 50 per cent tariff on Indian goods, saying the move is “hurting Americans & sabotaging the US-India relationship in the process. ”The committee, criticising Trump’s focus on India’s purchase of Russian oil, further questioned the motive behind the move. “It’s almost like it’s not about Ukraine at all,” it said in a post. The criticism came on the day the tariffs officially took effect, following a US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) notice that implemented Executive Order 14329 signed by Trump on August 6.The executive order, titled “Addressing Threats to the United States by the Government of the Russian Federation,” directed a new duty rate on Indian imports. The CBP said the Secretary of Homeland Security had determined it necessary to revise the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, applying the higher duties to all Indian products entering or withdrawn for consumption in the US.Meanwhile, New Delhi called the tariffs “unfair, unjustified and unreasonable.” Its export body urged government intervention to prevent job losses as businesses warned of severe economic impact.Donald Trump has defended the levies as part of efforts to cut Moscow’s revenue streams from oil sales that fund the war in Ukraine.Seeking to reassure, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox Business that Trump maintains good ties with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “I think at the end of the day, we will come together,” he said.",Democrats on the US House Foreign Affairs Committee slammed President Donald Trump’s decision to impose a 50 per cent tariff on Indian goods.

Phoenix Suns/Mercury Minority owners challenge Mat Ishbia over transparency and valuation disputes



Mat Ishbia responds to the lawsuit by the minority owner

Tensions inside the Phoenix Suns and Phoenix Mercury ownership group have escalated into the courtroom. Two minority investors, Kisco WC Sports II and Kent Circle Investments, filed a lawsuit in Delaware against controlling owner Mat Ishbia, alleging a lack of transparency, mismanagement, and conflicts of interest. The case highlights a rift within the franchise’s ownership, where disagreements over valuation, access to financial records, and buyout negotiations are now being fought through legal channels.At the center of the lawsuit are investors Andrew Kohlberg of Kisco and Scott Seldin of Kent Circle, both holdovers from the Robert Sarver era. When Ishbia purchased the Suns and Mercury in 2023 for $4 billion, he offered to buy out all minority shareholders. Fourteen of the sixteen accepted. Kohlberg and Seldin declined, keeping their stakes. Now, both claim Ishbia has blocked their access to basic financial documents and failed to provide clarity on investments, including the Mercury’s new practice facility.The complaint accuses Ishbia of using “a leverage strategy to exert pressure on and dilute the Company’s minority owners” through a sudden capital call issued on June 2.The plaintiffs argue the per-unit valuation presented during the call was “strikingly low and bears no relationship to the actual value of the company.” They point to rising franchise sales, such as the Boston Celtics’ $6.1 billion deal in April and the Los Angeles Lakers’ reported $10 billion valuation, as evidence their stakes are being unfairly undervalued.Their attorneys stressed the stakes of the dispute. “Transparency with minority owners is not optional, and our clients think it is critical to the success of the Suns.” They are seeking court approval to review financial records, damages, and reimbursement of legal costs.The Suns’ attorneys strongly deny the allegations. In a letter obtained by multiple outlets, team counsel David Marroso stated, “Your clients have no right to insist that ISH Suns acquire their interest at all, much less at the valuation and premium they are demanding.” The letter acknowledged the team’s value is “approaching $7 billion” but argued that does not obligate the franchise to buy out minority stakes.The team also accused Kohlberg and Seldin of attempting to pressure Ishbia into an inflated deal. “Kohlberg and Seldin have resorted to threatening baseless litigation and sensationalized press coverage as a means of intimidating and coercing ISH Suns into unprincipled and unjustified buyout negotiations,” the letter read. “That will not work. ISH Suns and the Company will not be bullied by these sharp and abusive tactics. ”This lawsuit is the sixth filed against the Suns organization since November 2023, adding to a growing list of legal and workplace disputes.Also Read: Luka Doncic gets heartfelt surprise from Jeanie Buss and Rob Pelinka ahead of his EuroBasket game","Two minority owners of the Phoenix Suns have filed a lawsuit against controlling owner Mat Ishbia.

After Tariffs, Now U.S. To Deprive Indians Of H-1B Visas? Trump Aide's Big Hint

Key proposed changes include:



A maximum four-year stay limit for F and J visa holders

A reduced post-study grace period for F-1 students, from 60 days to 30

Restrictions on graduate-level F-1 students switching programs mid-course

A 240-day admission cap for I visa holders, with exceptions for certain cases involving China

The United States department of homeland security (DHS) has proposed new regulations to eliminate the current “duration of status” framework for certain nonimmigrant categories and replace it with fixed admission periods, ANI reported.The changes would apply to academic students (F), exchange visitors (J), and representatives of foreign media (I), according to a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) published by US immigration and customs enforcement (ICE).The DHS said that the current system - which permits these visa holders to remain in the US indefinitely as long as they comply with the terms of their status - does not provide immigration officers with “enough predetermined opportunities to directly verify that aliens are engaging only in authorised activities.”If implemented, the proposed rule would require these nonimmigrants to apply for an extension of stay (EOS) with DHS if they wish to remain in the US beyond their approved admission date.The proposed changes follow increasing concerns about visa oversight and national security, with DHS citing a high volume of admissions: over 1.6 million F-1 students, more than 500,000 J visa holders, and over 32,000 I visa holders in 2023 alone.According to the NPRM, “greater oversight would deter fraud and abuse and strengthen the integrity of these nonimmigrant classifications.”The DHS said these changes would align these visa categories with other nonimmigrant classifications that already operate under fixed admission periods and allow officials to “periodically and directly assess whether nonimmigrants are complying with the conditions of their classifications and US immigration laws.”","The United States department of homeland security (DHS) has proposed new regulations to eliminate the current “duration of status” framework for certain nonimmigrant categories.
