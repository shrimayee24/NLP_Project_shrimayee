NEW DELHI: Uttarakhand has seen significant development strides over the past three years under chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami , with strong support from the central government—often described as the ""double engine"" model. During Dhami's tenure, the central government has approved new projects and accelerated previously stalled ones, furthering the state's development agenda.While AIIMS Rishikesh is fully operational, the central government has now approved a satellite AIIMS centre in Kichha, Udham Singh Nagar, which is anticipated to begin operations next year. This facility aims to improve healthcare accessibility for Kumaon and Terai residents. Additionally, the central government has allocated 100 MBBS seats for a new medical college in Haridwar and sanctioned another 100 seats for Almora Medical College, adding 200 medical seats in the past two years.With central support, the Delhi-Dehradun Expressway is making swift progress. A notable feature is the elevated road section through Rajaji National Park, nearing completion. This expressway will reduce Delhi-Dehradun travel time to about two and a half hours from the current five to six hours. The central government has also approved the Najibabad-Afzalgarh bypass to shorten distances between Garhwal and Kumaon. In the past three years, rural road construction in Uttarakhand has surged, with the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana adding 519 new roads spanning 1,481 km and connecting 35 villages previously without road access.The central government is pushing to complete the strategic Rishikesh-Karnaprayag rail line by 2026, with track installation set to begin soon. Efforts are also underway to prepare Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) for other rail routes, including Bageshwar-Tanakpur and Rishikesh-Uttarkashi. Eleven railway stations across Uttarakhand—including Dehradun, Haridwar, and Kathgodam—are set for transformation into Amrit stations under the new fiscal budget, which allocates Rs 5,131 crore for rail projects in the state.Following Uttarakhand’s success in hosting four G20 meetings, which showcased its culture, cuisine, and spiritual heritage, the central government has chosen the state to host the National Games in January-February next year. The event is expected to boost sports infrastructure and highlight Uttarakhand on a national level.The central government has included 51 Uttarakhand villages along the Nepal and China borders in its Vibrant Village Programme. These villages, situated in five development blocks across three border districts, will see 510 development projects with an investment of Rs 758 crore. The state has also received approval for over 18,000 additional housing units under the PM Awas Yojana (Gramin).The central cabinet has greenlit the Lakhwar multipurpose project, which will provide irrigation for around 34,000 hectares, produce 300 MW of hydropower, and supply drinking water to six states, including Uttarakhand and Delhi. The much-anticipated Jamrani dam project in Kumaon has also received approval, signalling progress in water resource management.""Prime Minister Narendra Modi once declared that the coming decade will belong to Uttarakhand. Following this vision, the central government is providing full support for the state’s development. With significant central backing, Uttarakhand is building a robust infrastructure network. For this, the people of Uttarakhand express their gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi,"" said chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami.","Uttarakhand has seen significant development strides over the past three years under chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami.

"Women’s empowerment in Uttarakhand: Policies, progress, and future goals",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/womens-empowerment-in-uttarakhand-policies-progress-and-future-goals/articleshow/115068606.cms,"DEHRADUN: Women have been central to the success of Uttarakhand since its formation, with many playing a crucial role in the state's development. In several hill districts, women outnumber men due to migration, making them the backbone of local life. Over the past 24 years, women in Uttarakhand have increasingly risen to prominent positions in various sectors, a trend that reflects their growing leadership in the state.Following the formation of Uttarakhand, the state government has taken significant steps to empower women, yielding positive results. A landmark reform was the introduction of reservation for women in urban local bodies and the three-tier Panchayat system, which has paved the way for the emergence of women leaders at various levels. In a further push for gender equality, the current government under chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami has decided to implement 33% reservation for women in cooperative societies. Additionally, the government has reinstated 30% horizontal reservation for women in government jobs. Notably, the state’s chief secretary is a woman, and women are now holding key positions, such as District Magistrates and Superintendents of Police, in several districts.The government is also focusing on education and financial support for women, with a special emphasis on girls' education. To incentivize female education, the state has launched several schemes under the Nanda Gaurav Yojana, which provides Rs 12,000 at the birth of a girl and Rs 51,000 after she completes Class 12. Additionally, the chief minister’s Mahalakshmi Kit is provided to every family at the time of a girl’s birth, helping support the early years of a girl child.To honor the contributions of women, the Uttarakhand government presents the State Stree Shakti Tilu Rauteli Award every year on the birth anniversary of the legendary warrior Tilu Rauteli. The award, which includes Rs51,000 in cash, a memento, and a certificate, recognizes women who have excelled in various fields. In another move to support working women, the government has started establishing working women’s hostels in districts such as Dehradun and Haridwar, offering affordable and secure housing for women living away from home.The state government is taking concrete steps to economically empower women. In an effort to encourage property ownership among women, it is offering exemptions on stamp duty for properties purchased in women’s names. Additionally, the government’s Lakhpati Didis scheme, launched in 2022, has already seen over 100,000 women becoming lakhpatis. The scheme aims to boost the annual income of women in self-help groups to over Rs1 lakh, providing them with opportunities in agriculture, dairy, tailoring, catering, and more.The government is also offering interest-free loans of up to Rs 5 lakh to self-help groups to help women start their own businesses. Furthermore, the Mukhyamantri Sashakt Bahna Utsav Yojana aims to increase the income of women’s groups across the state.CM Dhami emphasized the government's commitment to empowering women, stating, ""The state government is dedicated to maternal power. Our government's effort is to strengthen the economic position of women. To achieve this, we are running several schemes through women’s groups. Additionally, women are being provided loans for self-employment. This is why we have implemented reservation for women in government jobs.""He further added that the upcoming Uniform Civil Code (UCC) will play a significant role in further empowering women economically and socially, making them more secure in both their personal and professional lives.The Uttarakhand government’s continued focus on women’s empowerment is evident through these initiatives, which aim to create a more inclusive and equitable society for women in the state.","Women have been central to the success of Uttarakhand since its formation, with many playing a crucial role in the state's development.

Breaking the cycle of suffering,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/breaking-the-cycle-of-suffering/articleshow/115067365.cms,"‘Inadequate awareness’

Prenatal tests important

For almost a decade-and-a-half, Kishore Meshram has been undertaking a gruelling 85km journey from his village in Narkhed taluk to Nagpur every month, accompanying his son Mayuresh — now 14, a thalassaemia patient — for blood transfusions.Meshram and Mayuresh aren’t alone. Across Central India, several others need to travel long distances to reach the Thalassaemia and Sickle Cell Centre (TSCC) at Jaripatka in Nagpur, Maharashtra, with the medical facility serving as a lifeline for impoverished tribals in a 500km radius.Without consistent transfusions, these patients have to endure excruciating agony or even face death.Patients also need clinical intervention during vaso-occlusive crisis (when microcirculation is obstructed by sickled RBCs). As countless patients suffer in silence, the number of those afflicted with these genetic disorders continues to mount. Currently, there are more than 1.5 lakh thalassaemia and 14 lakh sickle cell anaemia patients nationwide.“Inadequate awareness about inherited blood disorders is the sole reason why the burden of thalassaemia major and sickle cell anaemia continues to surge despite being entirely preventable,” said Dr Vinky Rughwani, di rector, TSCC, which provides transfusions — otherwise unaffordable for the hundreds who come from faraway hamlets of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh — for free.Established in 2004, TSCC has conducted more than 66,600 complimentary transfusions for 1,500 registered patients and provided free consultation to 45,000 individuals. It also offers free periodic assessments for cardiac, renal, hepatic, and other ailments to monitor treatment side-effects.TSCC has collaborated with Bengalurubased Sankalp India Foundation to screen expecting mothers for haemoglobinopathies. In the past year, TSCC screened approximately 21,000 pregnant women, identifying more than 1,800 carriers who required testing of their spouses. Ultimately, 286 couples were found to be at heightened risk of giving birth to a child with thalassaemia major or SS-pattern.Advocating mandatory premarital screening for thalassaemia and sickle cell disease, Rughwani asserts that every individual must undergo testing before marriage. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or a prenatal test is playing a key role as a prevention tool. Of a sample size of 21,000 pregnant women, “at least 9% were found to have traces of sickle cell or thalassaemia, while 15% of 1,800 couples were at risk”, he said. Daga Hospital, Govt Medical College and Hospital, and Indira Gandhi Govt Medical College and Hospital also provide medications, transfusions, and diagnostics to patients, though they lack a dedicated facility for the treatment of these conditions.Paediatrician Dr Sanjay Deshmukh said Nagpur requires a govt-dedicated sickle cell and thalassaemia centre for transfusion, diagnostic, and advanced treatments, such as bone marrow transplant (BMT), as patients from across Central India seek treatment there.Prompt treatment, fewer formalities, and a spectrum of allied complimentary services are some of the benefits that draw patients from Vidarbha and other parts of Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, and Madhya Pradesh.Meshram said before being referred to TSCC, was strained both financially and mentally. He now goes about in his village, urging marriageable youths to take the test before selecting their life partner or planning a child.Nevertheless, much remains to be done for these patients, feels Rughwani.A significant breakthrough came with Coal India’s announcement of a Rs10 lakh sponsorship for thalassaemia patients under 12 years of age to undergo BMT.Since then, 50 patients from TSCC have benefited. “The CM and PM’s relief funds, Coal India Ltd, and other organisations have enabled us to provide Rs 15 lakh for BMT, alleviating the financial burden on families,” said Rughwani. Looking ahead, he’s resolute in securing job reservations for patients and govt funding for BMT for sickle cell patients, marking the next milestone in his mission to secure the lives of those affected.(Know about any such inspiring story?

We’ve said that we respect Canada’s judicial process,” Wong had said at a news conference with Jaishankar.“We convey our views to India as you would expect us to do and we have a principled position in relation to matters such as the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary and also, frankly, the sovereignty of all countries,” she added.","MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said that Jaishankar also raised the issue of ""political space"" being given to ""anti-India elements"" in Canada.

"In Trump moment, a Democrat win lights up an NCR house",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-trump-moment-a-democrat-win-lights-up-an-ncr-house/articleshow/115061466.cms,"GHAZIABAD: Over the past couple of weeks, candidates of several political parties have passed by Haider house in Sanjay Nagar, canvassing for votes for the Ghaziabad assembly bypoll on November 20. But its residents, Ali and Chandni Haider, have been glued to their phones and TV, taking in every update from the US — their interest not in the Trump-Harris duel for the White House, but a small country election in the state of Illinois.There, around the same time Republicans led by Trump began scenting a decisive victory, an Indian-American Democrat pulled off an impressive win in DuPage County. The victor happened to be Saba Haider (40), Ali and Chandni’s daughter.Saba won a seat in the DuPage County Board, defeating her Republican rival and incumbent Patty Gustin by 8,521 votes.The DuPage board comprises elected representatives from six districts. The tenure is decided on the basis of a draw — and Saba will be on the seat for two years.At her house in Chitragupta Vihar , her parents couldn’t be prouder.“She has always been this talented. Saba has a friend circle of politically active people who motivated her to run for the county polls. If she wants to go ahead in politics, we are always there for her,” says Ali, who retired as an engineer in UP Jal Nigam.Ali and Chandni now manage a school for the underprivileged in Ghaziabad. They live in the Sanjay Nagar house with Saba’s elder brother Avas and his family. They have a younger son, Zeeshan, who runs a business in Dubai.“When Saba was born, we lived in Sector 19 of Noida. We moved to Ghaziabad only in 1993,” Chandni tells TOI.Saba went to Holy Child School in Ghaziabad. She pursued BSc from Ram Chameli Chadha Vishvas Girls’ College in the city and bagged a gold medal in wildlife sciences from Aligarh Muslim University.“She would always take part in debates and oratory. I think her strong academic background created the foundation for her passion in politics and public service,” Chandni says.In 2006, Saba married Ali Kazmi , a computer science engineer from Bulandshahr, and relocated to the US with him. Settled in Chicago, the couple have two children — Azim (14) and Aizah (10).In the US, Saba became a certified yoga teacher — training a diverse range of clients from college students to corporate officers. That’s what made her popular among the locals, her mother insists.“Yoga is very popular in the US as well. Saba has hosted several events to promote wellness,” she says. “Her husband is also involved in social welfare and health services and supports my daughter’s political ambitions.”For Saba, her mother is her biggest inspiration. Announcing her win in the polls on Wednesday, Saba wrote on Facebook, “This win is dedicated to my mother, who is eternally optimistic and forever giving and kind. As a kid, whenever I told her that I wanted to achieve something that seemed outside the norm, she encouraged me and always said, ‘Absolutely, if you work hard enough!’ Mummy, thank you for encouraging me to believe in myself…”It wasn’t, however, a cakewalk for Saba. Her feet were numb from all the walking she had to do for canvassing.“Saba told me, ‘Mumma, I can’t even feel my feet’. I told her to get a foot massage, but she said she did not have time for it. On Monday, when the votes were cast, Saba said her toenails were broken and she was bleeding from them. It hurt to see my daughter in pain. But today, I am very proud of her,” says Chandni.The last time Saba came home was in June 2022, when Zeeshan got married.“She came to India after years. We had such an enjoyable time amid all the wedding celebrations. But we keep going to the US off and on,” she adds.This, however, was not Saba’s first time in the election fray. In November 2022, she lost the county polls by around 1,000 votes. “She was determined to contest again. And we were there to support her,” her mother says.Saba has left no stone unturned since the loss. “I have gone to so many doorsteps, spoken to people and canvassed for votes,” she told TOI on Thursday from Chicago.For Saba, raising two children and gaining a foothold in politics simultaneously was easier said than done. “Being from Ghaziabad, I had never seen snow in my life. Here, we get 2ft of snow. Battling extreme weather conditions, shopping from only one ‘desi’ grocery store and raising children was quite difficult for me and my husband. But, we gradually settled in,” she says.Does she see a stable career in politics? “I haven’t yet thought about it. I am just working for the community and will see where it takes me. This win means a lot to me as my opponent had been a candidate for the past 20 years.”On Trump’s win, she says, “I had hoped the Democrats would win. However, accepting the results in this democracy, I hope the next leadership focuses on growth, development and inclusivity. There is a lot of confusion and fear among the people of this country that needs to be addressed.”","Saba Haider won a seat in the DuPage County Board, defeating her Republican rival and incumbent Patty Gustin by 8,521 votes.

""All central agencies will support the states in every way, from gathering intelligence to taking action. But until one group is created with a 'zero-tolerance to terror' mood, the national counter-terror policy and strategy cannot succeed,"" he underlined, while batting for a 'whole-of-govt' approach.The home minister sought to impress on the need for states to work in close coordination both among themselves and with the central agencies, saying that while states may have geographical and constitutional limitations, terror operations transcend inter-state and global boundaries. He asked thanas to be anti-terror ready by training their officers in use of artificial intelligence to analyse various police/criminal databases, including those maintained by NIA. The NIA must move from ""a need to know"" approach to a 'need to share' and eventually a ""duty to share"" approach.""To deal with new challenges like terror financing and crypto , a coordinated approach must be adopted from police stations up to the DGP office,"" said Shah.He said the govt has come up with a model anti-terrorism squad (ATS), model special task force (STF) and model police training manual for the states and Union Territories, which, if adopted, will work as a common structure and platform to deal with the menace of terrorism.""The SOPs can be tweaked by the states as per their requirements. Coordination through ATS and STF does not undermine the federal rights of states,"" assured Shah.Reminding the police officers of PM Modi's goal to make India a developed power by 2047, the home minister said there would be security challenges along the way, and insisted on taking on the terror ecosystem with a unified, anti-terror ecosystem.Stating that the Modi govt, in its last 10 years in power, had adopted a zero-tolerance approach and cracked down on both terror and terror financing, Shah said the improved security situation was evident from terror incidents having declined by 70% as compared to the preceding 10 years.Shah asked DGP-rank officers present at the conference, to invoke the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) to deal with terror. He shared that NIA has filed a chargesheet in 498 of the 632 cases registered by it, with its conviction rate being almost 95%.","The home ministry is working on a national counter-terror policy and strategy. It is likely to pitch for a uniform, cohesive and zero-tolerance approach among various central and state agencies.

Have to assume no ban order exists, and hence, can’t examine its validity, says HC

NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court ended proceedings on a plea challenging the ban on the import of Salman Rushdie 's controversial novel, The Satanic Verses , after noting that the authorities had failed to produce the 1988 notification on the ban and it must be ""presumed that it does not exist"".In an order passed on Nov 5, a bench of Justices Rekha Palli and Saurabh Banerjee said that the petition, filed in 2019, was therefore infructuous, and the petitioner would be entitled to take all actions in respect of the book as available in law.The Rajiv Gandhi govt had banned the import of the Booker Prize-winning author's book citing law-and-order reasons in 1988.Petitioner Sandipan Khan had moved court arguing that he was unable to import the book because of a notification issued by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs on October 5, 1988, banning its import into the country in accordance with the Customs Act.He, however, contended that the notification is neither available on any official website nor with any of the authorities concerned. During the course of the court proceedings, the authorities maintained that the notification was untraceable.The bench observed: ""What emerges is that none of the respondents could produce the said notification dated Oct 5, 1988, with which the petitioner is purportedly aggrieved and, in fact, the purported author of the said notification has also shown his helplessness in producing a copy of the notification during the pendency of the writ petition since its filing way back in 2019.""""In light of the aforesaid circumstances, we have no other option except to presume that no such notification exists, and therefore, we cannot examine its validity and dispose of the writ petition as infructuous,"" it concluded.The petitioner sought to set aside other related directions issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs in 1988.","Have to assume no ban order exists, and hence, can’t examine its validity, says HC.

NEW DELHI: Members of country's erstwhile royal families have expressed strong opposition to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's recent comments in an editorial, accusing him of misrepresenting the contributions and legacy of India’s princely states.Rahul Gandhi in his opinion piece for the Indian Express, scrutinized India’s colonial history, with specific references to how the East India Company allegedly manipulated Indian royalty for its gain.""India was silenced by the East India Company. It was silenced not by its business prowess, but by its chokehold. The Company choked India by partnering with, bribing, and threatening our more pliant maharajas and nawabs. It controlled our banking, bureaucratic, and information networks. We didn't lose our freedom to another nation; we lost it to a monopolistic corporation that ran a coercive apparatus,"" Rahul wrote in his article.Representatives of royal families argued that these comments by Rahul were not only a distortion of historical facts but also a disservice to those who fought and sacrificed for India’s independence.Rajasthan's deputy chief minister Diya Kumari, whose grandfather was Jaipur's final ruling Maharaja Man Singh II, rejected Rahul's claims and dismissed his assertions as a gross misrepresentation.""I strongly condemn Rahul Gandhi's attempt to malign the erstwhile royal families of India. The dream of an integrated India was only possible because of the utmost sacrifice of these families. Baseless allegations, founded on half-baked historical interpretations, are completely unacceptable,"" Kumari said.BJP leader and Rajya Sabha MP Jyotiraditya Scindia from Gwalior's dynasty opposed the Congress leader's statements. ""Those who sell hatred have no right to lecture on Indian pride and history,"" he said.Accusing Rahul of a “colonial mindset,” Scindia countered Gandhi’s interpretation by citing figures such as Mahadji Scindia, Kittur Chennamma, and Rani Velu Nachiyar—figures he argued were true patriots in India’s freedom struggle.""Your selective amnesia about your own privilege is a disservice to those truly striving against adversity,"" he noted.BJP MP from Mysore Yaduveer Wadiyar, and Wadiyar dynasty descendant, stated, ""Rahul Gandhi's lack of knowledge of true history is on constant display. His latest statement, via an article this morning, reflects his ignorance of the contributions made by the erstwhile princely states towards today's Bharat, the patronisation of Bharatiya Heritage, without which, we might have lost many of the traditions we hold dear today, and most importantly, the sacrifices they made made towards the formation of a unified India.""BJP MLA from Dewas and royal family member Gayatri Raje Puar criticised Rahul's statements as disregarding the royals' role in preserving ""Sanatan Sanskriti."" She emphasised their contribution to protecting heritage, sovereignty, and culture, resulting in ""Akhand Bharat.""BJP leader and Nathdwara MLA Vishvaraj Singh Mewar said that Rahul's comments demonstrated either ""ignorance or intentional misrepresentation.""BJP leader Smriti Irani also criticised Rahul Gandhi's article, stating, ""Those who have relegated the Congress party to a 'private limited company' are talking about East India Company.

Activists claim UGC cell sitting on ragging plaints,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/activists-claim-ugc-cell-sitting-on-ragging-plaints/articleshow/115064438.cms,"Medical colleges figure disproportionately in the list of complaints to UGC's anti-ragging cell, but anti-ragging activists complain that the complaints don't always lead to action. They cite the complaint filed by first year students of JLN Medical College in Raipur about being forced to tonsure their heads and being slapped and physically harassed in the hostel as an example. No action has been taken on the complaint so far.Within weeks of 2024 academic year starting on Oct 14, the anti-ragging cell has received over 55 complaints from medical colleges across India, which is almost 42% of total complaints received from all colleges. In 2024, of the 800 complaints received by the cell so far, 222 were from medical colleges and 230 from engineering and polytechnic colleges. This is despite the fact that there are just over 700 medical colleges compared to over 8,000 engineering and technology colleges.In four cases from medical colleges, the victims took their own lives. Anti-ragging activists say UGC data doesn't even capture all incidents because you cannot register an anonymous complaint. ""The reported case of severe ragging in RVRS Medical College in Bhilwara, Rajasthan, does not feature in UGC list of complaints though the students tried to complain. They insisted on the student identity being revealed and since the student was not willing to do so, the complaint does not figure in the list,"" explained Gaurav Singhal of Society Against Violence in Education (SAVE), a non-profit that works on preventing ragging.""In case of JLN Medical College, Raipur, though the complaint was registered, no action was taken by UGC or college authorities. This college is notorious for ragging and equally infamous for an administration that refuses to act. The authorities summoned the entire first year batch and asked if anything was wrong,"" said Rupesh Kumar Jha, of SAVE.Jha said that most complaints were made anonymously because if any student's identity was disclosed, seniors could mark him or her for even more severe ragging and abuse.""This is a common problem. So, victims are scared. If you are serious about tackling ragging, anonymous complaints must be given importance. It is for the UGC or college authorities to investigate and verify the truth in such complaints. In JLN Medical college, the boys were forced to shave their heads. If students are going around in uniform with shaved heads or if all freshers have a peculiar hairstyle, it is evidence that ragging is going on. How can the college authority deny it?"" asked Jha. ""College authorities take it as a personal attack on them and almost never act on their own. Instead of being thankful that students are informing them that all is not well in the college, they victimize the complainant. This is why students cannot be expected to seek help from within the college. We must prevent ragging by implementing the detailed action plan mandated by the Supreme Court order in 2009,"" said Prof Rajendra Kachroo, the father of Aman Kachroo who died from violent ragging in 2009.Neither the college authorities, nor National Medical Commission (NMC), UGC or health ministry responded to queries from TOI regarding inaction on complaints of ragging from the college.","Of 800 complaints received by the cell so far, 222 were from medical colleges.

NEW DELHI: Hopes of Jet Airways getting fresh wings crashed on Thursday as the Supreme Court ordered its liquidation, with the successful bidder - Jalan Kalrock Consortium - failing to deposit even the first tranche of Rs 350 crore of the Rs 4,783 crore resolution plan for years, thereby burdening SBI-led lenders with huge financial liabilities.Noting the gross violations of the plan by JKC, comprising UAE-based NRI Murari Lal Jalan and Florian Fritsch, who holds shares in Jet Airways through his Cayman Islands-based investment holding company Kalrock Capital Partners, the SC exercised its rarely-exercised omnibus powers under Article 142 of the Constitution to order liquidation of the unviable airline.In a 169-page judgment which provided guidelines for future Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) proceedings and streamlining the processes before company law tribunals NCLT and NCLAT, the bench accepted arguments of additional solicitor general N Venkataraman and SBI counsel Sanjay Kapur to allow SBI-led lenders' consortium to forfeit the Rs 250 crore deposited by JKC as well as its Rs 150-crore performance bank guarantee.Writing the judgment for the bench, Justice Pardiwala said, ""The amount of Rs 200 crore already infused by SRA (successful resolution applicant in JKC) stands forfeited. Lenders/creditors are further permitted to encash the performance bank guarantee of Rs 150 crore furnished by SRA. We order accordingly.""The bench said, ""In the peculiar and alarming circumstances as discussed in this judgment and keeping in mind the fact that almost five years have elapsed since Resolution Plan was duly approved by NCLAT and there being no progress worth the name, we are left with no other option but to invoke our jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution and direct that Jet Airways be taken in liquidation. The NCLT, Mumbai, shall now take appropriate steps for appointment of liquidator and all other necessary formalities for commencement of liquidation of Jet Airways.""Faulting NCLAT for allowing JKC to adjust performance bank guarantee of Rs 150 crore to meet the shortfall in deposit of first tranche of Rs 350 crore which was to be made good by May 22, 2022, the bench said for five years, the resolution plan remained in limbo during which period several dues, including airport dues, to be paid by Jet Airways have increased due to the fault of JKC. ""The court must ensure that such debts stop running at some point of time,"" it said.The bench said although IBC was enacted to ensure survival of bankrupt entities, the same must not come at the cost of efficiency. ""In scenarios such as the present, 'timely liquidation' is indeed preferred over an 'endless resolution process',"" it said. ""Such a view will prevent the likelihood of adversely affecting interests of all creditors who have been suffering due to no fault of their own and securing the maximisation of value of the remaining assets,"" the court said.Rejecting pleas of senior advocates Mukul Rohatgi and Gopal Sankaranarayanan, who appeared for JKC and blamed SBI-led consortium of non-cooperation while seeking more time to fully pay the first tranche, the bench said, ""No further extensions or accommodations can be given to JKC in light of multiple opportunities already granted.""Terming JKC case an eye-opener for the IBC platform, Justice Pardiwala said, ""Scrupulous following of the code along with behavioural and ethical discipline is especially required from key participants of IBC who are central to its design, that is the adjudicating authorities, corporate debtors, resolution professionals, committee of creditors, potential and successful SRAs, approved valuers, and liquidators.""","The successful bidder - Jalan Kalrock Consortium - failed to deposit even the first tranche of Rs 350 crore of the Rs 4,783 crore resolution plan for years.

NEW DELHI: With stubble burning likely to peak in the next few days, the environment ministry has doubled the penalty for burning paddy crop residue by farmers. The revised fines range from Rs 5,000 to Rs 30,000 per incidence, depending on the size of the offender's farm.The revised penalty will be imposed on violators with immediate effect in Punjab, Haryana, Delhi and NCR areas of UP and Rajasthan.Notified on Wednesday, the rules specify that farmers with less than two-acre farm land will have to pay a penalty of Rs 5,000 per incidence, if they are found burning stubble.Those having two acres or more but less than five acres will have to pay Rs 10,000 per incidence; and those having more than five acres of land will have to pay Rs 30,000 per incidence.The notification replaced the Imposition, collection and utilisation of environmental compensation for stubble burning rules, 2023, which had provisions of penalties of Rs 2,500, Rs 5,000 and Rs 15,000 per incidence, depending on the three land size categories.The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in National Capital Region (NCR) and adjoining areas has been given the power under the rules to impose penalty (environmental compensation) on erring farmers.The commission accordingly on Thursday authorised all nodal/supervisory officers, appointed by the govts of Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, to impose and collect environmental compensation, as per the revised rates.

Punjab remains the worst affected, accounting for over 74% of the cases. Out of the 400,461 cases recorded in six states, Punjab recorded 296,670 cases, followed by 50,242 cases in Madhya Pradesh.Before the start of the ongoing season, Punjab, as per the Consortium for Research on Agroecosystem Monitoring and Modeling from Space (CREAMS), had recorded over 75% of burning cases, with the state reporting 291,629 cases out of a total of 387,946. With fewer burning cases in the ongoing season, Punjab has decreased its share by 1%. Crop residue burning is recorded by CREAMS using satellite data from September 15 to November 30.Though Punjab and Haryana have faced criticism from various agencies for worsening air quality in the National Capital Region (NCR), Haryana has recorded even fewer stubble burning cases than Madhya Pradesh, at 24,361.","Stubble burning cases cross 4 lakh in 6 states in 6th year, 74% in Punjab.

However, the Forest Survey of India had informed the court that as many as 1,670 trees were cut during Feb 16-26 for widening of road for proper access to vital installations like a super specialty hospital to treat wounded paramilitary personnel and the Saarc University.Carbon stock loss due to felling of trees in 2.32 ha area is estimated at 130.36 tonne in all the five pools, which is equivalent to 477.99 tonne of CO2, the FSI had said. The forest department of Delhi had contested the FSI's claim. FSI has strongly objected to the under-reporting of the trees still standing in the project area. While the forest department said the total number of trees standing are 106 in RFA and 200 outside RFA (total 306), the FSI put their numbers at 166 inside RFA and 1,488 outside RFA (total 1,654).","The bench asked senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan to suggest a mechanism to be put in place to prevent such illegal felling of trees by any authority in the ridge areas.

3 fingers, 'station', auto: How cops saw through 'blind case'

NEW DELHI: In a major breakthrough, Delhi Police has arrested three men in connection with the brutal gangrape of a 34-year-old woman researcher from Odisha reported on Oct 11. Their probe has revealed that the incident happened near ITO and the woman, who suffers from a mental health condition, was dumped in southeast Delhi's Sarai Kale Khan in an auto. The survivor is still under treatment at a central government hospital, police said.According to police, two of the accused, one intoxicated, had conspired to rape the woman when they found her alone. They allegedly took her to an isolated area by force and assaulted her. An autorickshaw driver, who witnessed the act, allegedly raped the woman in his vehicle before dropping her at Sarai Kale Khan, where she was found. TOI had reported the incident on Oct 12.Among the arrested men is the auto driver, Prabhu Mahto (28); a scrap dealer, Pramod Babu (32); and a beggar, Mohammed Shamshul (29). They were tracked down using CCTV analysis, technical surveillance and human information networks. The investigators have recovered crucial evidence linked to the crime. The autorickshaw has also been seized.Crucial physical evidence, including the blood-stained clothes of the survivor, comprising a pant and salwar, besides the clothes the accused were wearing at the time of the crime have also been seized. These include clothes of Mahto, Pramod and Shamsul and the latter's cap, belt and shoes.The survivor of the horrific gangrape lay silently in a bed at the AIIMS Trauma Centre, lost in thought. Outside, there waited a posse of cops hoping she would say something that would help them catch her assailants. It was a blind case. Forget the identity or number of assaulters, even the time and place of the crime wasn't known.The woman had been discovered at Sarai Kale Khan in a battered state, in pain and unable, or unwilling, to speak. Constable Sangeeta went to the ward in the guise of a social worker. After consulting the AIIMS Trauma Centre management, the cops also got an Odia translator to go in as a nurse. The two were assigned to take care of the survivor while building trust and gathering information.The survivor took some time to open up. She showed three fingers when asked how many men had assaulted her. ""One of them was handicapped and they had an auto,"" she told the undercover duo. She also uttered the word 'station'. She was unable to reveal other details, like the time and place of the rape due to her preexisting mental health challenges and the trauma of her horrific experience.Joint commissioner of police Sanjay Jain formed a special team led by DCP Ravi Kumar Singh and ACP Aishwarya Singh and 10 sub-teams to pursue the case. Sub-inspector Shubham Chaudhary prepared a site plan, identifying more than 700 government and private CCTV cameras installed on the major and minor roads starting at the point where the woman was discovered on Oct 11. The investigators got their first lead when they found CCTV footage showing the victim exiting the Old Delhi Railway Station waiting hall at 10.14am on Oct 10.The team then analysed footage from cameras at Kashmiri Gate, Red fort, Daryaganj, Mahatma Gandhi Marg, Rajghat-Shantivan, Rajghat Depot Bypass, ITO, Mathura Road, PWD headquarters, DTC headquarters, Indraprastha depot and the petrol and CNG pumps between ITO and Sarai Kale Khan. This helped prepare an electronic map of the route possibly taken by the survivor.After minutely studying the possible route taken by the woman, more than 150 autorickshaws identified by both visible and non-visible licence plate digits were verified. The breakthrough came with the spotting of an autorickshaw parked near the scene of crime. The same auto was then seen moving and stopping at another location.""Here, the driver exited the vehicle and crossed the road,"" DCP Singh said. ""This spot was where we obtained a partial number plate. After sustained efforts, the autorickshaw was correctly identified as bearing the number DL1RAA 9327 and its driver on the night of Oct 10-11 was determined to be Prabhu Mahto."" The registration details were used to track down the driver. An officer explained that Mahto's mobile location was tracked and matched the spot in the CCTV footage.Sustained efforts were made to locate the accused and Mahto was arrested on Oct 30. He was interrogated at length and he helped the cops identify and nab the second accused, Pramod alias Babu, on Nov 2. The third man alleged to be involved in the crime, Mohmmad Shamshul, was arrested on Nov 4. The successful manhunt had taken 21 days.""We will ensure the accused get the harshest punishment under the law,"" said a senior officer. Under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, anyone accused of involvement in gangrape can be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term that is not less than 20 years and which may extend to life, which will mean imprisonment for the remainder of that person's natural life. A fine may also be charged additionally.","Delhi Police has arrested three men in connection with the brutal gangrape of a 34-year-old woman researcher from Odisha.

Ottawa events binned over security issues

NEW DELHI: India called out Canada for what it described as Ottawa's ""hypocrisy"" on freedom of speech in blocking a publication based in Australia - Australia Today - that highlighted foreign minister S Jaishankar's remarks against Canada this week in Canberra. The govt also said Canada had not provided security for the consular camps that Indian missions have been hosting in the country, despite increasing threat to Indian officials, leading to cancellation of some of the camps.On its X account, Australia Today says it carries news and opinions from Australia focused on multicultural communities and the Indian subcontinent. MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in a media briefing on Thursday that social media handles and pages of this particular publication, which he described as an important diaspora outlet, had been blocked and were no longer available for viewers in Canada.""This happened just a few hours after this outlet carried a press conference of the external affairs minister along with his counterpart Penny Wong. The outlet also published several articles on the visit of the external affairs minister, as well as an interview with him. So, we were surprised. It seems strange to us,"" he said.""I will say these are actions that highlight yet again Canada's hypocrisy on freedom of speech,"" the official added.In a joint press conference with Wong, Jaishankar had accused Canada of developing a pattern of making allegations without backing those with any evidence. He had also said surveillance of Indian diplomats was unacceptable, while reiterating India's position that Canada provides political space to extremists.""So, you can draw your own conclusion about why Australia Today was blocked,"" Jaiswal said. The official also said threats to Indian diplomats in Canada had increased and Ottawa had not provided security for Indian consular camps.""Over the last year or even more, the kind of things that we have seen... attacking Indian diplomats, threatening, intimidating, harassing Indian diplomats,"" he said. ""Threats to Indian diplomats in Canada have increased. They have been put under surveillance, which is unacceptable.

Compromise between accused & survivor no ground to quash child sexual assault case: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/compromise-between-accused-survivor-no-ground-to-quash-child-sexual-assault-case-sc/articleshow/115063777.cms,"NEW DELHI: Holding that sexual assault of a child is too serious a crime to be allowed to be quashed without trial on the basis of compromise between the accused and survivor's family, Supreme Court on Thursday said that such offences are not private in nature but against the whole society.A bench of Justices C T Ravikumar and Sanjay Kumar set aside an order of Rajasthan high court which had quashed criminal proceedings against a teacher in sexual assault case of class XI student. The HC let the accused off on the ground that the student's family compromised with the teacher just a week after the case was lodged. Though the father of the survivor supported the accused in SC also, the court did not accept his plea and paved the way for trial against him on a petition filed by neighbours of the victim student.""In view of the nature of the offences alleged against the third respondent (the accused), one can only say that if they are proved they could be treated only as offences against the society and at any rate, it cannot be said that prosecuting an offender against whom such allegations are made is not in the interest of the society. In fact, it would only be in the interest of society. In that view of the matter, when by quashing the FIR by invoking the power under Section 482, Cr. P.C., the accused was relieved of the liability to face the trial...,"" the bench said.The apex court said that the HC must have given due regard to the nature and gravity of the crime. It said before passing order the Court has to apply its mind to (i) whether the crime is one against the society or against an individual alone (ii) seriousness and how the crime was committed (iii) whether offence(s) is one under a special statute (iv) stage of proceedings and how the accused managed to compromise with the complainant.""The power under Section 482 of CrPC could not be used to quash proceedings based on compromise if it is in respect of heinous offence which are not private in nature and have a serious impact on the society. When an incident of the aforesaid nature and gravity allegedly occurred in a higher secondary school, that too from a teacher, it cannot be simply described as an offence which is purely private in nature and has no serious impact on the society,"" the court said. ""We have no hesitation to hold that in cases of this nature, the fact that in view of compromise entered into between the parties, the chance of a conviction is remote and bleak also cannot be a ground to abruptly terminate the investigation, by quashing FIR and all further proceedings pursuant thereto, by invoking the power under Section 482, CrPC,"" it said. Quoting renowned American poet H W Longfellow, the court said a torn jacket might soon be mended, but a bruised heart of a child would be beyond reviviscence. It said that even a third party not directly affected by the crime can invoke the jurisdiction of Supreme Court to seek justice and punish the culprit.""According to us, such right to a third party to prefer a petition under Article 136 of the Constitution is certainly to be recognised and respected in a case where seemingly miscarriage of justice had occurred and still, neither State nor the victim or any relative falling under the term 'victim' approached this Court,"" it said.",Rajasthan high court had quashed criminal proceedings against a teacher in sexual assault case of class XI student.

The bench also held that the media's right to speech and expression is integral to fundamental rights.The bench highlighted that while the media reports on criminal investigations or pending cases, its freedom of speech and expression must respect the principle of separation of powers under the Constitution. This principle, along with the rule of law, dictates that the final and authoritative declaration of guilt or innocence is reserved for judicial authorities. Therefore, any definitive media statements about a party's guilt or innocence before a judicial determination do not fall under the protections under the right to speech and expression guaranteed by Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution.In instances where an individual claims that media actions have infringed, or are likely to infringe, on their right to dignity or reputation, they may seek relief in a constitutional court. The bench emphasized that, in situations of conflict between the media's right to expression and an individual's right to dignity, the media's freedom is not absolute. It must be exercised within the framework of constitutional ideals, values, and fundamental duties, which are binding on the media as well.The ruling also referenced the Supreme Court's Sahara case, which held that broad regulatory measures could constitute pre-censorship. Further, the bench noted that the media's role in disseminating information -- through print, electronic, or audio-visual means -- serves to inform citizens of their rights and responsibilities, promote responsible conduct in a democratic society, and enable public debate on govt policies and actions, fostering an egalitarian society. Accurate and contextually complete information is essential for this role, and it is because of this responsibility that the media's freedom of speech and expression is strongly protected under the Constitution. The judgment stemmed from petitions, including a suo motu case initiated following a standoff between lawyers and the media in the high court in 2016.","The HC has held that the media's right to freedom of speech and expression cannot be restricted except by a law enacted by a competent legislative body.

Upadhyay's order cited an internal report of Oct 14, which stated that no concrete evidence on the presence of 11 tigers for more than a year and for 14 tigers for less than a year.NTCA member-secretary Gobind Sagar Bhardwaj said, ""I have been closely monitoring the issue.

""The relevant department records are in the head office in Hampi,"" he said, adding the Hampi office may shed more light on the issue.Deputy commissioner Shilpa Sharma, too, claimed she is unaware of Bidar Fort being designated as Waqf Board property and said she will obtain information from the department concerned.Similarly, Dharmapur and Chatnalli villages of Bidar taluk are claimed by Waqf Board.

Nearly 19 acres of land that belongs to farmer Krishnamurthy in Udabal village in Chittaguppa taluk has been assigned to Waqf Board. Some 30 years ago, Krishnamurthy, in a gesture, had agreed to the burial of a Muslim man in a corner of his farmland.In 2013, Waqf Board officially recognised 960 acres of land in Chatnalli village.

Opposition leaders stormed into the well of the House, leading to a scuffle with Sheikh and other treasury bench members. BJP MLAs, led by Leader of Opposition Sunil Sharma, voiced strong objections to the banner display. As tensions escalated, the Speaker ordered marshals to remove unruly members and urged the opposition to maintain decorum.The uproar followed an earlier development on Monday and Wednesday, when the Assembly passed a resolution urging the Centre to consider restoring Jammu and Kashmir’s special status. Introduced by deputy chief minister Surinder Choudhary, the resolution read, “That this legislative assembly reaffirms the importance of the special status and constitutional guarantees, which safeguarded the identity, culture and rights of the people of Jammu and Kashmir, and expresses concern over their unilateral removal.”The resolution also called on the central government to initiate dialogue with Jammu and Kashmir’s elected representatives for restoring these provisions while balancing national unity and the aspirations of the region's people.The passage of this resolution on Wednesday, endorsed by valley-based parties including the National Conference (NC), People's Democratic Party (PDP), People's Conference, AIP, and CPI(M), was hailed by local leaders but sparked a fierce backlash from the BJP. Chief Minister Omar Abdullah, in response, stated, “The Assembly has done its job,” marking a significant step for the NC, which had pledged the restoration of Article 370 in its manifesto.PDP president Mehbooba Mufti supported the move, though she described it as “half-hearted” and said that the resolution could have been better crafted. However, the BJP was quick to reject the measure. Sunil Sharma, BJP Leader of Opposition, criticised the resolution's inclusion in Assembly proceedings, asserting that it was “not part of the listed business.” Sharma said, “We reject the resolution. The business given to us was that the discussion is on LG's address.”","Former union minister and BJP leader Smriti Irani criticised the Congress-led INDI Alliance’s recent move demanding the restoration of Article 370 and special status for Jammu and Kashmir.

During his campaign, Donald Trump has made several high-profile promises, some of which have sparked debate over their feasibility and potential impact. Many of Trump’s campaign promises involve significant legal , legislative, and logistical obstacles, meaning that even with substantial executive power, achieving these objectives would require cooperation from Congress, states, and possibly even constitutional amendments.The feasibility of these proposals largely hinges on navigating political opposition, potential legal battles, and the practical realities of implementation, making some of these promises more symbolic than achievable. Here’s a rundown of some of the bold promises he’s made on the trail, alongside an analysis of their practicality:Trump has pledged to overhaul the federal bureaucracy, replacing thousands of federal workers with those he considers ""loyalists.""Although a president can influence federal hiring and policies, sweeping federal layoffs face strong resistance due to existing civil service protections, union agreements, and procedural hurdles. Such moves would likely face significant legal challenges from federal employee unions and watchdog groups questioning the legality of mass firings based on political affiliation.Trump has proposed a 10% tariff on all imports to boost domestic manufacturing and reduce reliance on foreign goods.Imposing such a broad tariff would require congressional support, which is far from guaranteed. Economists warn that a blanket tariff could raise costs for American consumers, strain trade relations, and potentially prompt retaliatory tariffs. Higher import costs could impact inflation, a point that might attract criticism from economic policymakers.Trump has vowed to launch the most extensive deportation effort ever, targeting millions of undocumented immigrants.While the federal government has the authority to enforce immigration laws, scaling up to this level would require massive resources, funding, and cooperation from local law enforcement. Such an operation would likely face legal pushback and public resistance, particularly in sanctuary cities. The logistical complexity and potential societal disruption make this a challenging promise to fulfil.Trump has proposed constructing ""freedom cities"" on federal land to address housing shortages and encourage innovation.Creating new cities would be a monumental task involving land use policy, infrastructure development, environmental reviews, and state cooperation. While it’s possible for the federal government to support housing initiatives, building entirely new cities from scratch would require substantial funding, legislative approval, and time—likely extending beyond a single presidential term.Trump has expressed support for imposing the death penalty on drug dealers to deter drug-related crimes.Implementing this would be a significant legal and constitutional hurdle, as it would require changes to federal law and might face challenges regarding Eighth Amendment protections against cruel and unusual punishment. Applying the death penalty broadly would likely encounter strong judicial opposition.Trump has suggested reconsidering US involvement in NATO and scaling back certain international commitments.While a president can influence foreign policy, withdrawing from NATO would face resistance from Congress and military leaders, as it is a treaty-bound alliance integral to US defence strategy. Exiting NATO would likely be unpopular with allies and could be seen as a threat to US influence on the global stage.Trump has proposed imposing term limits for members of Congress.Changing term limits would require a constitutional amendment, as term limits are not currently part of US law for federal offices. This amendment would need a two-thirds majority in both the House and Senate, as well as ratification by three-fourths of state legislatures—a high bar that makes this unlikely to be achieved swiftly, if at all.Trump has hinted at increasing US control over industries deemed strategic, such as energy.Nationalising industries is rare in the US and would meet strong legal, economic, and political opposition. It would require new legislation, significant federal resources, and could clash with private sector interests, raising questions of economic efficiency and constitutional authority.Trump has pledged to restart and expand the border wall construction with added technological enhancements.While Trump may have executive power to direct border security funds, constructing a larger, more advanced wall would require sustained funding from Congress. Legal disputes over land rights and environmental concerns would also challenge rapid expansion efforts.Trump has promised to restore and prioritise energy independence by maximising US energy production, especially fossil fuels.Increasing fossil fuel production could be pursued through executive orders and regulatory changes, but would face resistance from environmental advocates and potential legal constraints. Shifts to renewable energy and global environmental commitments add further complexity, limiting the extent to which fossil fuels can be prioritised without political and environmental repercussions.Trump has frequently claimed he could end the Russia-Ukraine conflict within 24 hours by negotiating directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.A US president cannot resolve a complex conflict in 24 hours, despite having significant diplomatic influence. ""While a US president has significant diplomatic influence, resolving such a complex conflict in 24 hours is highly improbable,"" according to experts. The conflict involves deep-rooted geopolitical issues, territorial disputes, and significant military and economic stakes. These factors impact both countries involved in the conflict and their allies.","During his campaign, Donald Trump has made several high-profile promises, some of which have sparked debate over their feasibility and potential impact. Many of Trump’s campaign promises involve significant legal, legislative, and logistical obstacles. Even with substantial executive power, achieving these objectives would require cooperation from Congress, states, and possibly even constitutional amendments.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115020141,imgsize-25550,width-400,resizemode-4/115020141.jpg"

MUMBAI: A lakh plus Indian families are again biting their nails at the prospect of work (employment) authorization being revoked for the H-4 dependent spouse. Members of the Indian diaspora point out that obtaining an employment authorization document (EAD) means much more than financial freedom. It enables spouses to obtain a social security number, open a bank account and get a driving license. In short – be integrated into the American community.President Trump during his previous tenure had issued the Executive Order – Buy American, Hire American – a slew of measures had then followed including a proposed rule to revoke employment authorization for H-4 dependent spouses.Just in the nick of time before the rule was finalized, the Biden administration stepped in and the proposed rule was formally withdrawn in January 2021. “Trump’s return to power would likely bring a renewed attack, disproportionately affecting Indian families where highly educated H-4 spouses play critical roles in tech, healthcare, and other sectors. Eliminating H-4 work permits would be a severe economic and personal blow, particularly for families facing a decades-long green card wait,” points out Ashwin Sharma, immigration attorney.The EAD rule was introduced by the Obama administration in 2015 to mitigate the problems faced by certain sections of immigrants (such as the Indian diaspora) who faced backlogs running into several decades to obtain an employment based green card. As per an analysis by Cato Foundation, the employment based green card backlog from India (EB-2 and EB-3 skilled category) has crossed one million in March 2023. If factors such as death and ageing out are considered (which will lead to these individuals dropping from the backlog statistics) the wait for a green card is 54 years, else it is a whopping 134 years.Under a specific rule, spouses of H-1B visa holders who are eligible for green cards can apply for work authorization in the United States. This rule applies if the H-1B visa holder is on track to receive a green card or has been granted a visa extension beyond the standard six-year limit. The spouse, who holds an H-4 visa, can then submit an application for employment authorization.The EAD rule has faced several legal challenges. In 2015, an advocacy group of tech workers (Save Jobs USA), who lost their jobs to H-1B visa holders, litigated on the grounds that the Department of Homeland Security was not eligible to introduce the rule. Further, it contended that the right given to spouses to work, took away American jobs and made the H-1B program more attractive. A district court upheld this rule and in 2023, the US department refused to intervene in this decision – and the EAD rule seemed here to stay.With hiring of US workers to be a priority for the Trump administration, the question is not – will the EAD rule be revoked, rather the question being asked in hushed tones among the Indian diaspora is – when?",A lakh plus Indian families are biting their nails at the prospect of work (employment) authorization being revoked for the H-4 dependent spouse. Members of the Indian diaspora point out that obtaining an employment authorization document (EAD) means much more than financial freedom.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115018275,imgsize-143922,width-400,resizemode-4/115018275.jpg"
Why does the US vote in November but the new president starts in January?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-does-the-us-vote-in-november-but-the-new-president-starts-in-january/articleshow/115019371.cms,"US election in November, president inauguration in January: Understanding the timeline

Election timing: In 1845, Congress established the timing for federal elections, setting the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November as Election Day. This date was chosen to accommodate an agrarian society: early November allowed farmers to complete the harvest and travel to polling places without interrupting agricultural duties. Additionally, Tuesday was preferred to avoid conflicts with religious observances on Sunday and local market days on Wednesday.

Inauguration timing: Originally, the U.S. Constitution set the presidential inauguration for March 4, providing a four-month transition period after the November election. This lengthy gap allowed enough time for vote counting, electoral processes, and the physical travel needed in an era when communication and transportation were slow. In 1933, the 20th Amendment shortened this gap by moving Inauguration Day to January 20, reducing the “lame-duck” period in which an outgoing president remains in office without significant power. This change was intended to streamline the transition and address inefficiencies associated with a prolonged wait between election and inauguration.

Reasons for the November-to-January gap

Transition planning

Electoral college process

Appointment of electors : State governors appoint electors, typically by early December, based on the state’s popular vote.

: State governors appoint electors, typically by early December, based on the state’s popular vote. Electors’ vote : On a set date in mid-December, the Electoral College meets in each state to officially cast votes for president and vice president.

: On a set date in mid-December, the Electoral College meets in each state to officially cast votes for president and vice president. Certification of votes: In early January, Congress convenes to count and certify the electoral votes, officially confirming the election results before the inauguration. This process provides a formal mechanism to verify the vote, giving an additional layer of credibility to the outcome.

Legal and procedural safeguards

U.S. president inauguration day: Key traditions and events

Swearing-in ceremony: The president-elect and vice president-elect take their oaths of office, a tradition that has remained largely unchanged since George Washington’s inauguration. The ceremony is typically held on the West Front steps of the U.S. Capitol at noon, symbolising the start of the new administration’s term.

Inaugural address: Following the swearing-in, the president delivers an inaugural address, outlining the vision, priorities, and aspirations for the upcoming term. Each inaugural address is unique, reflecting the themes and goals of the new administration while honouring the traditions of the office.

Departure of the outgoing president: After the swearing-in, the outgoing president and first lady leave the Capitol, often through a formal send-off, signifying the peaceful transfer of power. This departure reinforces the country’s commitment to a democratic process and respect for the electoral outcome.

Inaugural luncheon: The new president attends a luncheon hosted by the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies (JCCIC), where members of Congress and other dignitaries gather to honour the new administration.

Pass in review: The president reviews military troops, honouring the role of the armed forces and symbolising the president’s new role as commander-in-chief. A ceremonial procession down Pennsylvania Avenue follows, leading to the White House.

Presidential escort and inaugural parade: After the Pass in Review, the president is escorted to the White House in a procession that includes representatives from various branches of the military, celebrating the diversity and unity of the nation.

Inaugural balls and celebrations: In the evening, inaugural balls and other festivities are held to honour the new administration, allowing public participation in the celebrations. These events may be adjusted depending on circumstances, such as security concerns or public health issues.

In the United States, the presidential election and inauguration are separated by several months, a timeline that reflects both historical tradition and logistical needs. While the election occurs on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November, the newly elected president is inaugurated only on January 20 of the following year. This transitional period serves multiple functions, from providing the incoming administration with time to prepare for governance to allowing the Electoral College to complete its process. The November-to-January gap is rooted in the structure of the U.S. electoral system, combining constitutional requirements, historical precedents, and practical considerations to ensure a smooth transfer of power. Here’s a detailed look at why this timeline exists and what events fill the gap between Election Day and Inauguration Day.The U.S. electoral timeline sets the country apart from other democracies, where elections and the transfer of power often occur within a shorter timeframe. The U.S. approach stems from a combination of historical scheduling and constitutional amendments that have shaped the election-inauguration gap over centuries.The period between Election Day and Inauguration Day serves several purposes essential to a stable and orderly transition of power.: The transition period is crucial for the president-elect, who must assemble a team, nominate cabinet members, and begin formulating key policies. This period allows the incoming administration to prepare for governance, helping to ensure that they are ready to address national and international responsibilities immediately after taking office. It includes detailed briefings, security updates, and policy reviews.An orderly transition is particularly important in times of crisis, allowing the new administration to continue policies or make necessary adjustments without disruptions. The transition also allows time for outgoing staff to assist the incoming team, ensuring continuity in government operations.: Unlike many countries, the U.S. does not select its president based solely on the popular vote. The Electoral College, an intermediary body, formally elects the president and vice president. The Electoral College process includes key dates and steps:: The period between the election and the inauguration also provides time for legal and procedural safeguards, including recounts and the resolution of potential disputes. In close or contested elections, this timeline allows for legal challenges to be addressed in court, ensuring that the final result is legitimate and free from unresolved disputes before the inauguration.This period offers a buffer against any attempts to disrupt or contest the election outcome, reinforcing the stability of the democratic process and giving citizens confidence that the result reflects their choice.Inauguration Day is a ceremonial event that formally marks the transfer of power to the new administration. Traditionally observed on January 20, it includes several symbolic events that reinforce the nation’s commitment to a peaceful and orderly transition.","In 1845, Congress established the timing for federal elections, setting the first Tuesday after November as Election Day.
