India Acts As Iran Burns: First Batch of Citizens Return Home After Advisory Amid Violent Protests

NEW DELHI: Several Indian nationals, returned from Iran, arriving at Indira Gandhi International Airport in New Delhi late on Friday amid escalating regional tensions.Their return follows an advisory issued by the Indian government urging citizens in Iran to leave the country due to the deteriorating security situation. The Ministry of External Affairs said it is closely monitoring developments and remains “committed to doing whatever is necessary for their well-being. ”One Indian national who returned from Iran described it as ""bad situation"" and expressed gratitude to the government for facilitating their departure. “The conditions are bad there. The Government of India is cooperating a lot, and the Embassy provided us with information on leaving Iran as early as possible...'Modi ji hai toh har cheez mumkin hai',” he said.Another returnee told ANI that conditions had worsened sharply in recent weeks. “We were there for a month. But we were only facing problems for the last one or two weeks...When we went outside, the protesters would come in front of the car. They would cause a little trouble...The internet was shut down, which is why we couldn't tell our families anything, so we were a little worried...Wecouldn't even contact the embassy,” he said.A third Indian national, a resident of Jammu and Kashmir, highlighted the risks posed by the unrest. “I am a resident of Jammu and Kashmir... The protests there were dangerous. The Indian government has made a very good effort and brought the students back...” he said.Family members of those returning gathered at the airport to welcome them home. Among them was a family awaiting the arrival of an aunt who had travelled to Iran on pilgrimage. “My wife's aunt went to Iran on a pilgrimage...Iran has always been a good friend of India and we were very confident in the Modi government, which continuously supported...We thank the government of India for making this possible. We are very happy as our family member is returning to India,” a relative said.Another man waiting for his sister-in-law thanked the authorities for coordinating the evacuation. “My sister-in-law is returning from Iran today. There was a war-like situation in Iran, and the internet was down. We were not able to contact her by any means. We were worried...We are very happy that she is returning to India safely...We thank the Government of India for making arrangements for their return to India during these difficult times,” he said.A family member of two returnees said communication had been cut off for days. “My mother and aunt are returning from Iran. We were worried because we were unable to contact her for three days...They are returning to India today,” he said.Earlier, the Indian Embassy in Tehran issued an advisory asking Indian nationals, including students, businesspeople, pilgrims and tourists, to leave Iran using available transport options, including commercial flights, citing the “evolving situation.”Separately, the Ministry of External Affairs in New Delhi strongly advised Indians to avoid travel to Iran until further notice. It reiterated a January 5 advisory urging those already in the country to remain cautious and avoid protests or demonstrations.The unrest began at Tehran’s Grand Bazaar on December 28 over the sharp fall in the Iranian rial and later spread nationwide. The currency’s decline followed multiple crises, including severe water shortages, power outages, rising unemployment and surging inflation.","Several Indian nationals, returned from Iran, arriving at Indira Gandhi International Airport in New Delhi late on Friday.

"Can't use law to scuttle Parliamentary process, says SC, rejects Justice Varma's plea",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cant-use-law-to-scuttle-parliamentary-process-says-sc-rejects-varmas-plea/articleshow/126593022.cms,"NEW DELHI: Holding that the Judges (Inquiry) Act cannot be interpreted in a manner that frustrates its objective, and constitutional safeguards for judges cannot come at the cost of paralysing the removal process itself, Supreme Court rejected Allahabad high court judge Yashwant Varma's plea against the Lok Sabha Speaker's decision to appoint a committee on the motion to remove him. It said the Speaker has committed no illegality.Though SC held that the Rajya Sabha deputy chairman was competent to refuse admission of notice of motion, it, however, said the manner in which the notice of motion was processed at the secretariat level does not fully align with the role contemplated under the law.The bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and Satish Chandra Sharma refrained from examining the validity of the deputy chairman’s order as it was not challenged by Justice Varma, but said it would have no effect.On July 25 last year, a notice on the motion to remove Justice Varma from his position was signed by over 100 LS members and it was received by the Speaker around 12.30pm, but was not admitted on the same day. After a brief interval, between 4.07pm and 4.19pm, a notice signed by more than 50 members was given in RS.Referring to the first proviso to Section 3(2) of the Act, which contemplates a situation in which notices are given in both Houses on the same day, the RS chairman directed that “the secretary general will take necessary steps in this direction”, but on the same day the chairman resigned from his office of vice-president of India.Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Justice Varma, submitted that when notices of motion are given on the same day before both Houses, judicial inquiry committee (JIC) could not have been constituted unless both Houses had admitted the motions. JIC has to be constituted jointly by the Speaker & the chairman, he said. Countering his contention, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said Section 3(2) is attracted only where the motions are “admitted” in both Houses, and not just being “given”.Rejecting Varma’s plea, the bench said the provision does not contemplate a scenario where a notice of motion is accepted in one House and rejected in the other. “To interpret the said proviso in the manner suggested by Rohatgi would require us to read into it a disabling consequence, namely, that the motion pending in the other House must also necessarily fail. Such an interpretation would amount to judicial legislation, a course we are neither empowered nor inclined to undertake,” it said.“There is nothing in the Inquiry Act to suggest that rejection of a motion in one House would render the other House incompetent to proceed in accordance with law. The argument, therefore, lacks any legal foundation. The interpretation advanced by the petitioner of rejection of a notice in one House resulting in the notice automatically failing in the other House would entail consequences of a most serious nature,” the bench said. “The members would be put to square one and the process has to be initiated afresh in either House. Had Parliament intended such far-reaching consequences, it would have articulated the first proviso in clear and unambiguous terms. The absence of any express provision to that effect is, in our opinion, determinative,” it said.The bench said accepting such an argument would produce absurd results where the individual capacity of one House in initiating a motion under Article 124(4) becomes contingent upon the outcome in the other House, even at the stage of admission of such a motion. It said taking away the autonomy of one of the two Houses of Parliament could not have been the intent behind the first proviso.“The proviso applies to only one specific situation, namely, where notices of motion given on the same day have been admitted by both Houses. It does not restrict or negate the individual authority of either House of Parliament,” it said.“The first proviso must, therefore, be construed to balance prescribed protection with the effective functioning of the mechanism for removal of a judge from office triggered by the peoples’ representatives, and not to frustrate it altogether,” it said.",Supreme Court rejects Allahabad high court judge Yashwant Varma's plea against the Lok Sabha Speaker's decision to appoint a committee on the motion to remove him.

NEW DELHI: The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and Maharashtra civic elections 2026 have marked a decisive shift in the urban political landscape. Held after a delay of nearly four years due to legal challenges and prolonged administrator rule, the elections across 27 municipal corporations and 2,869 seats were widely seen as a test of governance credibility and of existence for some.The verdict was emphatic. The BJP-led Mahayuti alliance emerged as the dominant force in urban Maharashtra, projected to win more than 1,800 seats statewide. In Mumbai, the Mahayuti crossed the majority threshold in the 227-member BMC, with the BJP seizing over 90 wards alone in its favour.With this, there ended the Shiv Sena 's uninterrupted control of the civic body since 1997 and marked the BJP’s first real capture of India’s richest municipal corporation.The biggest and the obvious winner of the civic polls verdict is Devendra Fadnavis and the Bharatiya Janata Party.The BJP has won over 90 wards of the BMC on its own, compared to 82 in 2017. In key wards such as Mulund West (Ward 103), the BJP defeated the MNS by a margin exceeding 12,000 votes.Statewide results reinforced this dominance. The BJP led in Pune Municipal Corporation with over 50 of 162 seats, secured a majority in Navi Mumbai (40 of 67), and crossed 80 seats in Nagpur’s 151-member civic body.Axis My India had estimated the BJP support among first-time voters (18–25 age group) at 47 per cent, while 44 per cent of women voters backed the party, influenced by welfare schemes such as Majhi Ladki Bahin and promises of tighter audits of civic spending.With the BMC’s annual budget exceeding Rs 60,000 crore, control over Mumbai’s civic machinery also enhances the BJP’s long-term institutional leverage ahead of the 2029 assembly elections.For the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena, the civic results offered political validation.Since the 2022 split, the Shinde faction’s central challenge has been legitimacy. The civic verdict, particularly in Mumbai and Thane, strengthened its claim. The party has won/leading on 352 wards and has emerged as the second largest party in Maharashtra civic polls.In Mira-Bhayandar and Ulhasnagar, the Shinde faction recorded near-sweeps, reflecting voter preference for continuity in infrastructure delivery over symbolic politics.The BJP–Shiv Sena–NCP Mahayuti alliance once again sealed the victory in Maharashtra.Despite contesting separately in some cities, the alliance demonstrated effective vote transferability in Mumbai, Nashik, and Nagpur.The alliance won or is leadinf in over 1,700 wards across Maharashtra.With a major victory, Mahayuti showed how to converted state-level power into grassroots and civic dominance.The All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) made modest but consequential gains in Maharashtra civic elections.The party registered victory/is leading on 94 wards, primarily in Muslim-majority pockets such as Bhendi Bazaar and parts of Kurla and Mumbra. In Aurangabad Municipal Corporation, it crossed 15 seats.While these numbers remain small, AIMIM’s presence seems to have fragmented the opposition vote, particularly hurting Congress and Shiv Sena (UBT).When the results of the Maharashtra civic elections were being tallied, one of the most unexpected stories to emerge was not about seats won or wards lost. It was about narrative currency — how a Tamil Nadu BJP leader emerged as a winner without contesting.And it all started with the 'rasmalai' controversy which begun when while campaigning in Mumbai for the BMC elections, Annamalai had said the city didn't belong to Maharashtra alone as it was an international city.The remarks triggered a sharp exchange at a joint Shiv Sena (UBT)–MNS rally in Mumbai. MNS chief Raj Thackeray took a swipe at Annamalai, mocking him as 'rasmalai' and questioning his authority to comment on Mumbai. He also raised the slogan “hatao lungi, bajao pungi”, a phrase long used derogatorily against South Indians in the city.However, Mahayuti won and BJP MPs and supporters were soon having a field on social media, posting photos of 'rasmalai' and mocking Raj Thackeray.The biggest electoral setback was suffered by Uddhav Thackeray. From over 130 BMC seats in 2017, Sena (UBT) fell to 72 seats. Even traditional strongholds such as Gorai and parts of Mahim witnessed defeats.The loss of control of the BMC is a big blow to Uddhav the Sena has always maintained its control over the civic body.His long-anticipated reunion with estranged cousin Raj Thackeray also failed to make any impact on the ground.The Indian National Congress emerged as one of the biggest losers of the BMC and Maharashtra civic elections because the results exposed its near-total erosion in urban politics.In the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, Congress was reduced to around 21 seats, a sharp fall from its already diminished presence in 2017, when it had crossed 30. Across Maharashtra’s 27 municipal corporations, the party managed roughly 306 wards out of 2,869.In Pune, once a Congress-influenced city, the party was restricted to fewer than five seats out of 162, while in Mumbai it failed to emerge as a serious contender in most wards.In Pune, it was reduced to fewer than five seats. The party which decided to go solo after that Thackeray cousins jouned hands, failed to make any impact in BMC polls where Uddhav's Sena won 72 seats.It seems that lack of a city-specific agenda, factional infighting and minimal national leadership presence during the campaign compounded the decline.For Raj Thackeray, the civic polls reinforced a long-term downward trajectory.The leader joined hands with his cousin Uddhav to keep the BJP at bay. But the results show how he failed miserably.During the election campaign, he tried to appeal around the idea of the 'Marathi Manoos' while invoking Balasaheb Thackeray. This politics of sentiment obviously has deep roots in Maharashtra’s history.He relied on fiery speeches, symbolic gestures and cultural flashpoints to command attention, often targeting migrants, linguistic outsiders, or perceived cultural dilution in Mumbai. Unlike mass welfare or governance-driven politics, his appeal was rooted in 'Marathi asmita'.This, however, failed to resonate with the voters. The MNS failed to secure major wins, while getting only 11 of 227 wards in Mumbai.At the state level, the party managed to get only 18 of 2869 wards.Sharad Pawar emerged as one of the biggest losers of the BMC and Maharashtra civic elections as the results exposed the steady erosion of his once-formidable grip over urban and organisational politics.For decades, Pawar was seen as the master strategist of Maharashtra, capable of shaping outcomes even when not in direct power. The civic verdict punctured that perception. The NCP (Sharad Pawar faction) failed to make any meaningful impact in the BMC, getting just 1 win in Mumbai wards and remaining marginal in Pune, a city long considered central to Pawar’s political influence.His strategy to join hands with nephew Ajit Pawar for the Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad municipal elections also failed as the BJP secured victory in these bodies.Statewide, the faction’s ward tally was 28 of 2869 wards, far below expectations for a party led by a veteran of his stature.Crucially, Pawar’s traditional role as an alliance-builder also lost relevance. Fragmentation within the opposition and the rise of a dominant Mahayuti alliance reduced his ability to act as a power broker. This time, though reports suggested he wanted the Maha Vikas Agadi to fight as a unit, he failed to keep the parties together, especially after the Thackeray cousins joined hands, pushing Congress to go solo.Despite being part of Mahayuti, Ajit Pawar has emerged as one of the losers this election. During the civic poll campaigns, Ajit Pawar repeatedly hit out at his own Mahayuti allies, Eknath Shinde and Devendra Fadnavis, exposing visible faultlines within the ruling alliance.As election date approached, he finally decided to unite with his uncle Sharad Pawar to contest Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad elections as a united front.His attacks were also unusually sharp for an alliance partner, with Pawar questioning why local bodies under BJP–Shinde control still struggled with water supply, roads and urban planning. In several rallies, he projected his faction as a corrective force within the government rather than a stakeholder in its record. .The civic results however suggest the tactic backfired. Ajit Pawar’s faction underperformed in Pune and Nashik, reinforcing the perception that public sparring with allies during elections diluted his credibility and bargaining power within the Mahayuti rather than strengthening it.Eventually, the Pawar lost their strongholds, Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, to BJP with huge margin.","The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and Maharashtra civic elections 2026 have marked a decisive shift in the urban political landscape.

NEW DELHI: The Maharashtra civic elections 2026, including the high-stakes Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) polls, delivered a resounding verdict to the BJP-led Mahayuti. Across 27 civic bodies and 2,869 wards, results show the BJP-led Mahayuti alliance decisively ahead, as the party and its partners captured key urban strongholds.Meanwhile, smaller players made targeted gains and traditionally dominant regional parties struggled to counter a robust campaign narrative focused on governance.The most striking outcome of the civic polls is the BJP ’s dominance, under the strategic leadership of Devendra Fadnavis. In the BMC, India’s richest municipal corporation, the BJP is on track to secure around 90 wards, compared with just 82 in 2017.When combined with alliance partners, the Mahayuti tally comfortably surpasses the 114 seats needed for a majority, currently projected at 140+ BMC wards. The BJP also leads major urban bodies:The outcome validates the ""triple engine"" narrative the BJP has pushed under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Analysts attribute the BJP-led Mahayuti’s march past the 100-seat mark to one overriding factor: a deeply fragmented opposition that converted the contest into a patchwork of “friendly fights” and multi-cornered battles. The sharpest splits emerged in the traditional Marathi heartland. Although the Shiv Sena (UBT) and the MNS stitched together a tactical understanding, they faced competition not only from the BJP but also from the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena . In more than 80 wards, the two Sena factions were locked in direct contests, effectively dividing the same “bow and arrow” legacy vote.The Congress ’s decision to stay out of the Sena (UBT)–MNS arrangement compounded the problem. By contesting independently in an attempt to consolidate minority and Dalit voters, the party instead triggered a three-way split in what observers described as the secular vote. In several areas, Congress candidates, along with those from the VBA and the Samajwadi Party, played a spoiler role that hurt Sena (UBT) more than the Mahayuti.This splintering meant that anti-Mahayuti sentiment never coalesced into a decisive bloc. Reports pointed to at least 15 instances of “friendly fights” where opposition or anti-BJP parties fielded candidates against one another. The internal rivalries not only confused voters but also drained organisational energy and resources, leaving the Opposition poorly positioned to mount a unified challenge to the BJP.The results underline a decisive realignment in Mumbai’s civic politics. The BJP, which for decades played second fiddle during the undivided Shiv Sena’s long reign over the BMC, has now emerged as the dominant force, aided by the Eknath Shinde-led Sena faction that broke away in 2022.The undivided Shiv Sena had controlled the 227-member BMC almost continuously since the late 1990s, making the civic body the cornerstone of its political and organisational power. For the Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena (UBT), the latest outcome marks its weakest showing in the corporation in more than 20 years, signalling a sharp erosion of its once-formidable urban base.Trends suggest that while the broader “Thackeray brand” retained limited resonance with voters, it was not enough to arrest the party’s decline. The results have also cast a spotlight on the future of the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), with questions mounting over Raj Thackeray’s political viability as his appeal failed to translate into significant electoral gains.Historically, the Shiv Sena, founded by Bal Thackeray, first captured the BMC in 1997, winning 103 seats and unseating the Congress, which secured 49. The BJP then won 26 seats, while the Samajwadi Party emerged victorious in 21 wards. In the 2017 polls, the undivided Sena had remained the single largest party with 84 seats, narrowly ahead of the BJP’s 82, while Congress won 31, the NCP nine, the MNS seven and the Samajwadi Party six. Although the BJP and Shiv Sena were allies, they had contested separately and stitched together an alliance after the results.In contrast, the current elections saw the Shiv Sena (UBT) and the MNS contest together in an effort to consolidate the Marathi vote amid a fractured Sena legacy. That strategy failed to hold Uddhav Thackeray’s traditional civic bastion.Political observers say the verdict reflects a fundamental shift in Mumbai’s civic power structure, with influence moving away from the Uddhav Thackeray-led Sena and the BJP significantly expanding its footprint in the country’s financial capital.Ajit Pawar’s bid to revive the Nationalist Congress Party’s urban strongholds through a late “family reunion” with the Nationalist Congress Party (SP) fell flat in the 2026 civic polls, as the Bharatiya Janata Party swept Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad.Seeking to blunt the BJP’s challenge in his traditional bastions, Ajit Pawar forged an alliance with his uncle Sharad Pawar’s faction and ran an unusually confrontational campaign against his own state-level ally. He accused the BJP’s local leadership of stalled development and corruption, and personally targeted Union minister and Pune MP Murlidhar Mohol, as well as Pimpri-Chinchwad MLA Mahesh Landge.The strategy did not work. Live trends showed the BJP leading decisively in both cities: over 110 seats in Pune, compared with the NCP’s 12 and NCP (SP)’s two, and 84 seats in Pimpri-Chinchwad against the NCP’s 37. The outcome significantly weakens Ajit Pawar’s bargaining power within the BJP-led Mahayuti alliance.Compounding the setback, Sharad Pawar remained largely absent from the campaign, as did Baramati MP Supriya Sule, blunting the optics of reconciliation. Ajit Pawar’s manifesto promises, including free Metro and bus rides and property tax relief for small homes, were ridiculed by BJP leaders as unrealistic.The polls, held after an eight-year gap, were also fought amid scrutiny of the Mundhwa land deal involving Ajit Pawar’s son, Parth Pawar. Together, the results underscore the limits of factional reunions without organisational unity or voter trust.One of the notable surprises of the 2026 civic results was the performance of the All India Majlis‑e‑Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM).AIMIM has won or is leading in over 90 seats, performing better that regional parties like Raj Thackeray's MNS and Sharad Pawar's NCP.While AIMIM’s overall tally remains modest compared to the Mahayuti or traditional Congress vote banks, the party’s strategic gains have reshaped local arithmetic in several wards. In tightly contested seats, their presence appears to have split opposition votes, inadvertently aiding Mahayuti victories.For the Indian National Congress, the civic polls were mostly disappointing, but not uniformly so.The party decided to enter the contest solo after the Thackeray cousins reunited. While it was at No. 4 in BMC with 23 seats, the party managed to get third spot overall in the state with over 300 votes.The party's performed better in the state compared to its Maha Vikas Agadi allies Shiv Shiv Sena (UBT) and NCP (SP).While it might not be enough, this little resurgence might provide the motivation the party needs for the upcoming state elections.","The Maharashtra civic elections 2026 delivered a resounding verdict to the BJP- led Mahayuti. Results underline a decisive realignment in Mumbai’s civic politics.

NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MPs PC Mohan and Tejasvi Surya on Friday took a 'rasmalai' jibe at Raj Thackeray - who had used the term to mock BJP leader Annamalai during his election campaign - as the saffron party dominated the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and other Maharashtra civic elections.PC Mohan, Lok Sabha MP from Bangalore Central, shared photos of 'rasmalai' (Indian sweet dish) on X and wrote: ""Ordered some rasmalai. #BMCResults.""The tweet was a direct jibe at Raj Thakeray, who started a war of words with BJP MP K Annamalai earlier last week.Mumbai BJP chief spokesperson Niranjan Shetty also celebrated the party's victory by distributing rasmalai. Soon, BJP MP Tejasvi Surya also joined in on X saying, ""A sweet 'Rasmalai' victory for BJP Mumbai in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation Election. Congratulations to CM Devendra Fadnavis and all dedicated karyakartas for their tireless efforts in this victory. The Triple Engine Sarkar, under the leadership of PM Modi, will work strongly for Mumbai’s redevelopment and improve Ease of living for all Mumbaikars. ""Meanwhile, Annamalai himself congratulated the Mahayuti government for clean sweep in Maharashtra civic polls.""The people of Mumbai have spoken with crystal clarity! The historic victory of the Mahayuti alliance in the BMC elections is a resounding endorsement of development-first governance.From the grassroots of local bodies to the halls of the parliament, this is the Triple Engine that delivers real, tangible development for every citizen. While the opposition trafficked in divisive narratives aimed at fragmenting the people, Mumbai chose unity, progress, and inclusive growth,"" the BJP leader wrote on X.Taking veiled jibe at Raj Thackeray, Annamalai wrote: ""The opposition was banking on the failed strategy of dividing Mumbaikars along linguistic and regional lines, a 20th-century relic the people soundly rejected. While our NDA government talks about development infrastructure, jobs, and growth, the opposition clung to an archaic narrative of regional animosity. Mumbaikars chose substance over divisiveness. ""The 'rasmalai' controversy started when while campaigning in Mumbai for the BMC elections, Annamalai had said the city didn't belong to Maharashtra alone as it was an international city.The remarks triggered a sharp exchange at a joint Shiv Sena (UBT)–MNS rally in Mumbai. MNS chief Raj Thackeray took a swipe at Annamalai, mocking him as 'rasmalai' and questioning his authority to comment on Mumbai. He also raised the slogan “hatao lungi, bajao pungi”, a phrase long used derogatorily against South Indians in the city.Annamalai responded defiantly, saying some had threatened to cut his legs if he visited Mumbai. “I will come to Mumbai. Try cutting my legs,” he said, insisting his comments had been misrepresented.Clarifying his position, Annamalai said praising leaders like K Kamaraj did not diminish their Tamil identity, just as calling Mumbai a world-class city did not erase the role of Maharashtrians in building it. He stressed that Mumbai’s growth was inseparable from the contributions of the Marathi people.Annamalai also accused Shiv Sena leaders of insulting Tamils by mocking their traditional attire, such as lungis and veshtis, and said it was surprising that the DMK chose to share political space with parties that resorted to such remarks.Interestingly, before 'rasmalai' it was 'jalebi' that was served as a sweet revenge by the BJP.In 2024, as the BJP swept Haryana assembly elections, its Haryana unit marked its dramatic comeback and a historic third consecutive assembly win with a pointed gesture: sending a kilogram of jalebis to Congress MP Rahul Gandhi's Delhi office.","PC Mohan, Lok Sabha MP from Bangalore Central, shared photos of 'rasmalai' (Indian sweet dish) on X and wrote: ""Ordered some rasmalai. #BMCResults"" The tweet was a direct jibe at Raj Thakeray, who started a war of words with BJP MP K Annamalai earlier last week.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126569536,imgsize-1180209,width-400,resizemode-4/file-photo.jpg"

Experts warn: Mass removal of stray dogs could backfire on public health,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/experts-warn-mass-removal-of-stray-dogs-could-backfire-on-public-health/articleshow/126556050.cms,"Image: IANS

Free-living dogs form stable social groups when food sources, sterilisation, and vaccination coverage remain consistent.

Large-scale removal disrupts these systems, creating territorial vacuums that are rapidly filled by other dogs -- often unvaccinated and unsterilised -- an effect associated with increased dog-bite incidents and heightened disease risk.

Mass removal undermines rabies control by dismantling herd immunity. India’s existing Catch-Neuter-Vaccinate-Release (CNVR) framework, when implemented consistently, targets the internationally recognised threshold of vaccinating at least 70% of dogs in a given area.

Data show steep declines in human rabies deaths and dog-bite incidence in areas with sustained sterilisation and vaccination programmes. Abandoning this approach risks reversing hard-earned gains achieved over past two decades.

Mass sheltering, experts argue, compounds the risks. High-density animal housing is globally classified as a biohazard activity, requiring stringent quarantine, disease surveillance, and worker-safety protocols.

Supreme Court Directs Dogs Be Shifted From Schools, Bus Stands To Shelters; Petitioner Breaks Down

A coalition of multisectoral experts from a range of global institutions has lent its weight to petitioners in the stray dog case being heard in Supreme Court. The coalition warned that authorities’ proposals to remove and mass-shelter India’s free-living community dogs could undermine public health, go beyond the law, destabilise urban ecosystems and impose enormous fiscal costs, without delivering greater public safety.The cautionary note draws on experience of veterans in public health, behavioural science, veterinary medicine and law. Signatories include Chinny Krishna who pioneered India’s Animal Birth Control programme, evolutionary biologist Lee Dugatkin (University of Louisville, US), Anindita Bhadra of IISER Kolkata, public health expert Leena Menghaney, Pushpinder Singh Khera of AIIMS Jodhpur, and Julie Corfmat of Mission Rabies among a host of others. Organisations include International Companion Animal Network (ICAN), Pet Dog Trainers of Europe (PDTE), International Institute for Canine Ethics (IICE) and Bangalore Hundeskole Academy for Research and Canine Studies (BHARCS). Highlights of their analysis:Dugatkin noted claims justifying removal often rest on myths rather than biology. “These dogs have coexisted with humans in India for millennia. Disrupting stable populations based on fear or misinformation ignores everything we know about animal behaviour and disease ecology,” he said.Anthrozoologist Sindhoor Pangal said the debate had become detached from evidence. “Replacing proven, low-cost public-health systems with a mass-detention model is not just unscientific -- it actively increases risk while draining resources that should be strengthening vaccination and disease prevention,” she said.Position statements from IICE highlight that large shelters frequently experience overcrowding, stress-induced immunosuppression, and rapid disease transmission, particularly where enforcement capacity is limited.Free-living dogs play a role in urban ecosystems by scavenging waste and limiting proliferation of rats and other scavengers that can’t be vaccinated or monitored. Sudden dog removal can lead to rodent population explosions linked to diseases such as leptospirosis and plague.Legal experts point out that mass relocation directly contradicts the Animal Birth Control (Dog) Rules, 2023, which mandate sterilisation, vaccination, and return to the original territory. Large-scale confinement also raises constitutional and labour-safety concerns, given occupational hazards associated with mass animal housing.","A coalition of multisectoral experts from a range of global institutions has lent its weight to petitioners in the stray dog case being heard in Supreme Court.

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Friday credited the BJP-led Mahayuti’s sweeping performance in the state’s municipal elections to its development agenda saying Hindutva and development were inseparable for the party.He said, ""Hindutva has always been our soul; one cannot differentiate our Hindutva from development""“First of all, I want to thank the citizens of Maharashtra for giving a grand victory to the BJP in the municipal elections. BJP and Mahayuti are going to form their 25 mayors after these elections,” Fadnavis said while addressing supporters after the results.He said the alliance had contested the civic polls with a clear focus on governance and infrastructure. “We faced these elections with a vision of development under the leadership of PM Modi... That is why we got a record-breaking mandate in these elections... These results have clarified that Maharashtra relies a lot on PM Modi,” he added.As per trends till Friday evening, the BJP-Shiv Sena Mahayuti was leading in a majority of municipal corporations across the state, including the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation.The saffron alliance was ahead on 130 of the 227 BMC seats, comfortably crossing the majority mark of 114. The BJP emerged as the largest party with 93 seats, while its ally Shiv Sena was leading on 27.Maharashtra Assembly Speaker Rahul Narwekar said the BMC verdict reflected Mumbai’s endorsement of the alliance’s development agenda. “First of all, I want to thank the people of Mumbai and express my gratitude for reposing faith in the BJP alliance... This mandate has been given for the development of Mumbai. We have won the trust of Mumbai's people by dedicating to them important projects like the Metro Rail Network, Coastal Road, and Trans Harbour Link, and this mandate shows the desire of Mumbai's people for the city's development,” he said.The BMC elections were held after a gap of eight years, with the previous polls conducted in 2017. Mumbai is set to get a new mayor after nearly four years, as the term of the last elected mayor, Kishori Pednekar, ended in March 2022.Elsewhere in the state, the BJP also posted strong leads in other key civic bodies. In Pune Municipal Corporation, the BJP was leading on 90 of the 165 seats, while the NCP was at 20. The Congress-Shiv Sena (UBT) alliance was leading in 10 seats, while the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena stood at two.The Mahayuti also crossed majority marks in Pimpri-Chinchwad, Navi Mumbai, Nagpur, Nashik, Jalna and Vasai-Virar, according to trends.Congratulating party leaders, CM Fadnavis called up state BJP chief Ravindra Chavan and Mumbai BJP president Ameet Satam as the alliance surged ahead in the civic polls. Maharashtra minister Nitesh Rane hailed the results, saying the Mahayuti was set to occupy mayoral posts across most municipal corporations.“It seems that everything is being prepared for people with the 'Jai Shri Ram' and 'I Love Mahadev' mindset, and those belonging to the Mahayuti alliance, to occupy most of the mayor's seats,” Rane said in a social media video.Polling for 29 municipal corporations across Maharashtra was held on Thursday, with counting taking place on Friday.","BJP-Shiv Sena Mahayuti was leading in a majority of municipal corporations across the state, including the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation.

NEW DELHI: The road transport ministry has notified that failure to pay toll or user fees on a national highway (NH) will result in the denial of a no objection certificate (NOC) for renewal of registration and insurance, change of ownership, transfer, and issuance of a fitness certificate.This notification comes barely a month before the scheduled rollout of Multi-Lane Free Flow (MLFF), or barrierless tolling, on around half a dozen stretches of the NH network.The notification was issued early this week. Work of MLFF is at an advanced stage at Manoharpur and Shahjahanpur on the Delhi-Jaipur highway, at Chorasi on the Surat-Vadodara stretch of NH-48 and at Gharonda on Delhi-Chandigarh highway. The changes in Central Motor Vehicles Rules are expected to boost digital collection of toll fees and ensure that no one skips paying toll when barrierless tolling is implemented.On MLFF stretches, there will be no physical barrier to stop vehicles for the collection of user fee. As per the notification, any “unpaid user fee” will be linked with the NOCs for vehicle related services and transactions. It defines unpaid user fee as the user fee payable by a vehicle for use of a section of NH, where the electronic toll collection system has recorded the passage of such vehicle but has not received the applicable user fee levied.Officials said that soon there will be a portal where people will be able to raise their complaints for settling disputes. “There will be enough scope for settlement before initiating action of blocking the NOC,” an official said.The road transport ministry has notified that failure to pay toll or user fees on a national highway (NH) will result in the denial of a no objection certificate (NOC) for renewal of registration and insurance, change of ownership, transfer, and issuance of a fitness certificate.

Car mileage claims to get real as govt pushes AC-on testing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/car-mileage-claims-to-get-real-as-govt-pushes-ac-on-testing/articleshow/126586190.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a move aimed at providing more realistic and accurate mileage figures for cars, the road transport ministry has proposed mandatory testing of fuel efficiency with the air-conditioning (AC) system both switched on and off. The proposed regulation will apply to all cars, including Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles and electric vehicles (EVs), manufactured or imported in India from October 1.Officials said subsequently, it will be mandatory for car manufacturers and importers to put the mileage for with and without AC on in the user manual of vehicles and on their website as well. So far car manufacturers have argued that as per European norms, only mileage without AC is taken into account. This is expected to improve transparency and help consumers make more informed purchasing decisions.The draft notification issued on Thursday said, “On and after October 1, 2026, all vehicles of category M1 (cars), manufactured or imported in India, shall be tested for measurement of fuel consumption with air-conditioning system in operation, as per AIS-213, as amended from time to time.” Officials said the move is intended to reflect real-world driving conditions, where AC usage significantly impacts mileage and energy consumption.At present, car manufacturers in India declare fuel-efficiency figures based on testing conducted without the AC running. Automakers have maintained that this practice aligns with prevailing European norms. However, govt officials noted that such figures often do not reflect actual on-road performance, leading to a gap between claimed and experienced mileage.AIS-213 lays down detailed procedures for measuring vehicle emissions and fuel consumption while the AC system is operational. The standard is designed to capture the additional fuel use and emissions generated due to AC load, which can substantially affect real-world efficiency and pollution levels.TOI has learnt that the ministry is also working on a broader framework to increase consumer awareness about vehicle emissions and in the near future, car owners may get exact information on this.","The proposed regulation will apply to all cars, including Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles and electric vehicles (EVs) It will be mandatory for car manufacturers and importers to put the mileage for with and without AC on in the user manual of vehicles.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126586439,imgsize-726145,width-400,resizemode-4/representative-image.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Friday inaugurated the 3rd International Kite Festival, urging the Delhi government and Delhi Development Authority (DDA) to form a committee to make the city the national hub for kite festivities, expand the event, and encourage public participation for a grand nationwide celebration.Addressing the 3rd International Kite Festival- 2026 in Delhi, Shah said, ""The kite festival will connect people across the entire country, and in the future, it can become a national festival. I urge the Delhi administration and the DDA to form a committee to make Delhi the centre of the kite festival for the whole country, and to work to expand it and ensure public participation to make it a truly grand celebration.""Shah also referenced the richness of India's festival culture, quoting poet Kalidasa, ""Utsav-priya janah,"" meaning the people of India are fond of festivals. He said that throughout the year, people across the country celebrate festivals, which bring society together and foster a collective vision, adding that Uttarayan is an integral part of this tradition.He recalled the role of kites in India's freedom movement, saying the Simon Commission faced strong opposition across the country, with the slogan ""Simon Go Back"" becoming a key symbol of resistance.""The most powerful protest happened during Uttarayan, when people all over the country flew kites with 'Simon Go Back' written on them, filling the sky and demonstrating their strength to the British,"" Shah said.Speaking about Somnath Swabhiman Parv to mark the 1000th anniversary of the first attack on the Somnath temple , Amit Shah said that those who destroyed Somnath are gone, but the temple stands proud.""PM Modi has created the Somnath Swabhiman Parv to mark the 1000th anniversary of the first attack on the Somnath temple. Now, the Indian government and several state governments have also decided to observe a Somnath Swabhiman Varsh.""He highlighted the resilience of the temple, stating,""The power of those who build is far greater than that of those who destroy. Those who destroyed it Mahmud of Ghazni, Mahmud Begada, Alauddin Khilji are nowhere to be seen on the world map today. The Somnath temple stands proudly in the same place, visible to the entire world. This is a symbol of the eternal nature and immortality of Sanatana Dharma, and that the fundamental elements of Indian culture are immortal,"" Shah said.",Amit Shah inaugurated the 3rd International Kite Festival- 2026 in Delhi.

NEW DELHI: The Delhi government on Friday approved a comprehensive roadmap to curb air pollution in the capital and clean the Yamuna, including installation of misting systems at 62 pollution hotspots and strengthening sewage and industrial waste treatment, as part of the city's pollution control plan up to 2028.Delhi Environment Minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa told reporters that the government has finalised short-term, mid-term and long-term measures with fixed timelines to tackle dust pollution, transport emissions, waste management, and river pollution.Special misting systems will be installed at 62 identified pollution hotspots, besides major traffic corridors and PWD roads, to control PM2.5 pollution, Sirsa said.He further said mechanical sweeping would be expanded to cover road stretches across Delhi, while the dust mitigation plans of multiple agencies, including the Public Works Department (PWD), Delhi State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (DSIIDC), Delhi Development Authority (DDA), New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC), Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) and the Cantonment Board have been reviewed and approved.""The issue of garbage mountains was reviewed, and a detailed plan has been finalised to ensure that all fresh municipal waste is processed through waste-to-energy projects by 2026-27,"" the minister said.He said discussions were also held on the Phase 5 expansion of the Delhi Metro network, requirement of thousands of buses by 2028, and construction of large bus terminals.""Measures to strengthen last-mile connectivity include increasing the number of e-autos, creating EV infrastructure, launching mobile applications for transport access, and developing adequate parking facilities at metro stations,"" Sirsa added.To improve the cleanliness of the Yamuna, the Delhi government has decided to set up additional biogas plants, and ensure industries install effluent treatment plants (ETPs) and sewage treatment plants (STPs) to prevent the discharge of untreated waste, he said.Sirsa said the chief minister had fixed clear timelines for action up to December 2026, December 2027 and December 2028.He also announced enhanced financial support to the MCD, under which the number of material recovery facilities (MRFs) will be increased from 70 to 250 across the city.He said discussions would also be held with the Centre and adjoining states, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, to jointly improve Delhi-NCR air quality.During the press conference, Sirsa also commented on the Sikh Guru-related row, alleging that Leader of Opposition Atishi had avoided facing the House and the public following her contentious remarks in the Assembly.""The Punjab Police has sought time for the third time. The same police which registered a case within hours are now unable to explain the basis of that case even after 10 days,"" he said, alleging ""dishonest intent"" and evasion of accountability.The ruling BJP has accused Atishi of using ""insensitive words"" during a discussion in the Delhi Assembly on January 6 to mark 350 years of the martyrdom of Guru Tegh Bahadur, Bhai Sati Das, Bhai Mati Das and Bhai Dayala, demanding an apology.","The Delhi government has approved a comprehensive roadmap to curb air pollution in the capital.

Budget 2026: Will tax provisions ease for crypto assets?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-will-tax-provisions-ease-for-crypto-assets/articleshow/126525033.cms,"Losses from VDAs cannot be set off — not against other income, nor even against gains from another crypto asset.

Key concerns flagged:

Crypto’s anonymous, borderless and near-instant transfers make tracking taxable income and beneficial ownership difficult for tax authorities.

Use of offshore exchanges, private wallets, and decentralised platforms complicates enforcement and obscures transaction trails, hindering accurate tax assessment and recovery.

Jurisdictional limitations add to the challenge, as many transactions occur outside India’s regulatory reach, making compliance and enforcement “virtually impossible.”

A tax framework that bites:

Non-residents and the unresolved ‘situs’ question:

Reporting income from VDAs:

Suggestions for

Budget 2026

:

Allowing set-off of losses between different VDAs, even if not against other income

Providing statutory guidance on the situs of VDAs, especially for non-residents

Reviewing the impact of 1% TDS on market liquidity

The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has raised fresh concerns about the risks posed by virtual digital assets (VDAs) such as cryptocurrencies, aligning its stance with that of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).The tax department’s warning presented recently to a Parliamentary Standing Committee of Finance underscores regulatory agencies' growing scepticism about cryptocurrencies fit within India’s financial and taxation framework. It highlights revenue risks, enforcement gaps and potential misuse for evasion or illicit finance.The tax regime in India, for VDAs can be considered as one of the most stringent in the world.The Finance Act, 2022, ushered in a bespoke tax regime for VDAs by inserting section 115-BBH into the Income-tax Act, 1961 (I-T Act). Income from the transfer of VDAs is taxed at a flat 30%, plus surcharge and cess, regardless of the holding period. The law allows only the cost of acquisition as a deduction, barring transaction fees, exchange charges or other expenses.More critically, losses from VDAs cannot be set off — not against other income, nor even against gains from another crypto asset.Losses also cannot be carried forward. A parallel provision mandates 1% tax deduction at source (TDS) on transfers beyond specified thresholds, further tightening liquidity. To illustrate: For a salaried individual, a 1% TDS is applicable on transfer of the VDAs if the transaction amount exceeds ­10,000.Various associations have in their pre budget submissions, argued that disallowing set-off of losses between VDAs is economically distortive and ultimately counterproductive for tax revenues.The argument is simple: when losses are ring-fenced, but gains are fully taxed, risk-taking is penalised asymmetrically. This has reportedly contributed to trading volumes migrating offshore, exchanges shifting operations overseas and Indian investors being pushed into cross-border structures that raise FEMA and compliance complexities.The result is a tax structure that treats crypto trading far more harshly than equities, real estate or even speculative assets, despite its growing mainstream adoption.While section 115-BBH of the I-T Act, applies equally to residents and non-residents, tax provisions are not clear on a crucial issue: where is a VDA located? For non-residents, taxability hinges on whether income accrues or arises in India (the provisions of sections 5 and 9 of the I-T Act and the relevant tax treaty provisions come into play).Unlike shares or immovable property, VDAs lack a clearly identifiable physical or legal location. In the absence of legislative clarity on the situs of crypto assets, non-resident taxation risks becoming a fertile ground for disputes particularly where trading occurs on global exchanges, assets are held in offshore wallets and sale proceeds are received outside India.Experts point out that clarity is essential to avoid avoidable litigation. Jurisdictions such as the UK offer guidance by linking the situs of crypto assets to the residential status of the beneficial owner, an approach India could adapt.Individuals dealing in cryptocurrencies are required to disclose income from virtual digital assets in Schedule VDA of their annual income tax returns — typically ITR-2 or ITR-3, depending on their income profile. The schedule seeks granular information, including the date of acquisition and transfer, cost of acquisition and sale consideration. Accurate reporting is crucial, as any under-reporting or misreporting of VDA income can attract penalties, apart from interest on unpaid tax.Possible reforms being discussed in policy circles include:Ashish Singhal, Co-founder, CoinSwitch said, ""India’s VDA ecosystem is at a pivotal stage, with growing adoption across the country. However, the current tax framework presents challenges for retail participants by taxing transactions without recognising losses, creating friction rather than fairness. A reduction in TDS on VDA transactions from 1% to 0.01% could improve liquidity, ease compliance, and enhance transparency while preserving transaction traceability. Raising the TDS threshold to ₹5 lakh would help protect small investors from disproportionate impact.""""Introduced in 2022 as a stand-in for regulation at that time, VDA taxation has since been complemented by strong oversight from FIU-IND and improved compliance. This Budget presents a great opportunity to revisit the framework in a manner beneficial to both investors and the government. We remain hopeful that the government will recognize this gap and consider reviewing the current framework soon,"" he concluded.","Crypto’s anonymous, borderless and near-instant transfers make tracking taxable income and beneficial ownership difficult for tax authorities.

Kyle Tucker vs Shohei Ohtani: Endorsements and investments

Kyle Tucker vs Shohei Ohtani: Real estate holdings

Kyle Tucker and Shohei Ohtani are both top-tier players, but their financial situations are quite different. Tucker has been steadily increasing his earnings with his contracts from the Chicago Cubs, making millions through arbitration and brand deals. In contrast, Ohtani has hit astronomical heights, securing a historic $700 million contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers and pulling in tens of millions more from endorsements.Fans may be curious about how Tucker’s earnings compare to a two-way sensation like Ohtani, whose appeal reaches both the U.S. and Japan. With everything from contracts to endorsements and real estate involved, the financial differences between these two athletes are fascinating.Shohei Ohtani has more than double the net worth as Kyle Tucker. Ohtani is expected to have a net worth of about $150 million by then. The calculation takes into account his $700 million contract with the Dodgers and annual endorsements that range from $40 million to $50 ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌million.On‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ the other hand, through his MLB salary and a fresh contract, Tucker's net worth is considered to be around $60 million.At the end of 2025, Tucker's career earnings are anticipated to reach $57.2 million, while his market value was figured at $195 million prior to signing his most recent ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌contract.Ohtani‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ signed an enormous 10-year, $700 million contract with the Dodgers in December 2023, which was the largest in sports history at that moment. Under this deal, 97% of the amount is deferred: he will be paid $2 million annually from 2024 through 2033 and then $680 million will be paid out in $68 million installments from 2034 to 2043.The present worth of the deferred sum is approximately $460 million. Ohtani suggested this plan so that the Dodgers can have some flexibility with their salary cap. For 2026, his payroll salary stands at $28,216,944 along with cash earnings of $2 million.Tucker entered into a 4-year $240 million deal with the Dodgers, with an average of $60 million a year - thus becoming the second-highest baseball contract without any deferrals behind just Ohtani's $70 million AAV. The agreement possesses the right to opt out after the second and third years. Prior to this, Tucker earned $16.5 million on a one-year arbitration deal with the Cubs in 2025. His total career earnings have reached $57,175,737 by ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌2025.Ohtani rakes in between $40 million and $50 million annually from endorsements, which makes him one of the top endorsers in the world.In 2025, his marketing earnings were projected to hit $100 million, outpacing LeBron James' $85 million. His appeal across cultures has drawn in brands from both Japan and the U.S., and merchandise sales broke records following his signing with the Dodgers.There's not much public info about Tucker's endorsements, but he does make money from brand deals, with baseball being his primary source of income. Recent sources haven't reported any specific investment details for Tucker.Ohtani bought a house in La Cañada Flintridge, California, for $7.85 million back in May 2024. He’s also part of a $240 million luxury housing project at the Mauna Kea Resort in Hawaii, where he snagged a $17 million property and acts as the celebrity spokesperson. Ohtani has committed to buying one of the 14 homes and intends to build a hitting and pitching facility for his preseason training.On the other hand, Tucker’s real estate investment isn’t publicly known.Also Read: Ryan Weathers says the New York Yankees were never on his radar until the Miami Marlins made the call","Tucker has been steadily increasing his earnings with his contracts from the Chicago Cubs, making millions through arbitration and brand deals.

Budget 2026: The urgent need to tackle long-pending and long drawn-out tax litigation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-the-urgent-need-to-tackle-long-pending-and-long-drawn-out-tax-litigation/articleshow/126556471.cms,"As of April 1, 2025, nearly 5.4 lakh appeals were pending before the Commissioner of Income-tax (Appeals). (AI image)

Here are top five issues that

Budget 2026

should tackle:

1. Reduce pendency before CIT(A) and allow refund of taxes collected during pendency of appeal

2. Rationalise provisions to facilitate obtaining full stay of demand during pendency of appeals

3. Reducing administrative inconvenience and hardship

4. Avoiding repetitive appeals by the Revenue

5. Strengthening the advance ruling mechanism

As the Union Budget 2026 draws closer, industry bodies and tax professionals are urging the government to shift part of its reform focus from tax rate rationalisation to the far more structural problem of long-pending direct tax litigation. On the ground, businesses argue that predictability, timeliness and administrative efficiency in dispute resolution matter as much as headline tax rates—particularly for capital-intensive sectors such as manufacturing.The scale of the problem is substantial. As of April 1, 2025, nearly 5.4 lakh appeals were pending before the Commissioner of Income-tax (Appeals), involving disputed demands of about ₹18.16 lakh crore. Protracted disputes result in working capital being locked up for years, management attention diverted from productive activity, and depressed valuations when Indian promoters seek foreign investment.Industry body FICCI has flagged the mounting backlog at the CIT(A) level as a critical bottleneck in the dispute resolution framework.The first appellate authority, meant to serve as an effective corrective forum, has instead become a point of prolonged delay.FICCI points out that pendency increased sharply after the faceless appeal regime was rolled out in 2021. While faceless appeals were introduced to eliminate physical interface and improve transparency, the absence of effective monitoring and the unfamiliarity of both officers and taxpayers with the technology have led to repeated notices, duplication of submissions and delayed disposals. Even where taxpayers have filed detailed responses on the portal, they are often asked to resubmit information without clarity on what additional inputs are required. Virtual hearings, when sought, are not granted liberally, and even when conducted, limitations in document presentation weaken effective representation.A key procedural gap, according to FICCI, is the absence of any time limit for assessing officers to submit remand reports called for by the CIT(A), coupled with ambiguity over whether jurisdictional officers or faceless units are responsible for such reports. Meanwhile, parallel penalty proceedings are routinely initiated while quantum appeals remain pending, resulting in both quantum and penalty matters piling up at the first appellate stage.The industry body warns that the litigation lifecycle—already 12 to 15 years before Covid—has now lengthened by another five years. This not only delays revenue collection for the government but also forces companies to carry disputed tax demands as contingent liabilities, adversely impacting share valuations during fund-raising or stake sales.To address this, FICCI has recommended prioritised disposal of appeals involving high-pitched assessments, scrutiny cases, matters where detailed submissions have already been filed, issues covered by High Court or Supreme Court rulings, and appeals pending for over five years. It has also called for filling nearly 40% vacancies at the CIT(A) level and introducing a dual-track system, with fast-track disposal for simple, low-value cases and a detailed track for complex, high-value disputes, backed by differentiated timelines and targets.Tax professional Sandeep Bhalla, Partner at Dhruva Advisors, notes that appeals pending before the CIT(A) for more than two years cause serious hardship, particularly where disputed demands continue to remain outstanding. He argues that in such cases, taxpayers should not be compelled to wait indefinitely and should be allowed to approach the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) directly.Bhalla suggests a structured mechanism under which the assessee could approach the Range Head (Additional or Joint Commissioner), who would prepare a concise factual and legal factsheet. This, along with the appeal records, could then be placed directly before the Tribunal for adjudication. Such a process, he believes, would help decongest the CIT(A) level while ensuring quicker resolution of long-pending disputes.At the same time, Bhalla emphasises that institutional accountability must be built into the system so that appeals remaining undisposed beyond two years without taxpayer fault are treated as a measurable performance failure rather than an administrative inevitability.FICCI has also called for a rethink of the current framework governing stay of disputed tax demands. Although CBDT instructions provide that a stay may be granted on payment of 20% of the disputed demand, taxpayers are often required to make this payment even when the issue has been decided in their favour in earlier years.Compounding the problem, refunds for subsequent years are routinely adjusted by the Central Processing Centre (CPC) against demands that are formally stayed, because stay orders are not digitally integrated with CPC systems. According to FICCI, this defeats the very purpose of a stay and intensifies liquidity stress for businesses.To resolve this, the industry body has suggested creating a real-time interface enabling assessing officers to upload stay orders so that stayed demands are automatically excluded from refund adjustments. It has also proposed allowing alternative forms of security—such as bank guarantees or indemnities—in appropriate cases instead of insisting on a cash pre-deposit, noting that international tax administrations adopt similar risk-based approaches without compromising revenue protection.Bhalla highlights that even after taxpayers succeed in appeals, delays in passing Orders Giving Effect (OGEs) often render appellate relief meaningless. Refunds remain on paper for months, or even years, resulting in continued cash-flow strain.He recommends that OGEs be system-driven and mandatorily passed within three months, with interest payable for departmental delays made personally recoverable from the concerned assessing officer. Mandatory uploading of scrutiny and compliance reports on the tax portal, he argues, would enhance transparency and accountability.Bhalla also points to the largely mechanical nature of rectifications under section 154 against CPC adjustments under section 143(1). He suggests that taxpayers should be allowed to file detailed reconciliations, that CPC orders rejecting rectification must give clear reasons, and that a virtual hearing should be provided wherever adjustments are proposed to be confirmed.Despite settled judicial precedents, the Revenue continues to litigate recurring issues, adding to the backlog. Bhalla recommends that the CBDT issue authoritative position papers on key settled matters, particularly those affecting specific industries, and hold field officers accountable for filing appeals contrary to binding rulings.Bhalla also flags concerns around the functioning of the Board for Advance Rulings, which replaced the Authority for Advance Rulings in 2021. More than four years on, the mechanism has failed to deliver the certainty it was meant to provide, especially for cross-border and high-value transactions, underscoring the need for corrective measures in Budget 2026.As India positions itself as a preferred investment destination, the credibility of its tax dispute resolution system will be closely watched by both domestic and global investors. Meaningful reforms that reduce pendency, ensure timely refunds and curb avoidable litigation could significantly improve confidence on the ground. Budget 2026, therefore, has a chance to signal that tax certainty and administrative efficiency are central to the government’s growth strategy.","As of April 1, 2025, nearly 5.4 lakh appeals were pending before the Commissioner of Income-tax (Appeals) Industry bodies and tax professionals are urging the government to shift part of its reform focus from tax rate rationalisation to long-pending direct tax litigation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126556606,imgsize-148077,width-400,resizemode-4/budget-2026-tax.jpg"
India has a river that flows backwards: Know which river it is,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/travel/india-has-a-river-that-flows-backwards-know-which-river-it-is/articleshow/126525975.cms,"The Narmada river flows in the opposite direction and here’s why

The origin of the Narmada River

The reason why the Narmada flow westwards

What landscapes does the river support

Dams and projects that lie on the river

Natural sites found along the Narmada

Narmada and its importance for faith and culture





India’s river systems are usually described as following a clear pattern. Most major rivers rise in the Himalayas or the central highlands and travel eastward to the Bay of Bengal, a rule taught early in geography lessons and seldom challenged. Yet one notable river defies this logic. Flowing westward across the subcontinent, it reshapes landscapes, livelihoods, and belief systems along its course. Far from obscure or insignificant, this river is long, deeply revered, and extensively studied, though its direction often surprises first-time learners. The Narmada stands apart not for its size or speed alone, but because its westward journey is dictated by geology rather than convention.The river that moves west instead of east is the Narmada. At roughly 1,310 kilometres, it ranks as India’s fifth longest river. Unlike rivers such as the Ganga or Godavari, it does not travel towards the Bay of Bengal. From its source, it heads steadily west and eventually meets the Arabian Sea. Only a handful of long Indian rivers do this. The Tapi is another. The idea of the Narmada flowing “backwards” only exists because most rivers around it flow the other way.The Narmada begins at Amarkantak in Madhya Pradesh. The area is forested and also known as a place of pilgrimage. From here, the river starts moving west. It passes through Madhya Pradesh, briefly touches Maharashtra, and then enters Gujarat. Its journey ends near Bharuch, where it reaches the Arabian Sea. Along the way, the river changes character. In some places it cuts through hills and narrow valleys. Elsewhere, it opens out and slows down. The upper stretches feel remote. The lower ones feel settled.The direction of the Narmada is shaped by geology. It flows through a rift valley created by ancient tectonic activity. This valley slopes from east to west. Water follows that slope. The Vindhya Range lies to the north of the basin, and the Satpura Range lies to the south. Because the river runs through this rift, it behaves differently from many others. It does not spread into a wide delta. Instead, it forms an estuary where it meets the sea.The Narmada basin covers varied terrain. The upper areas are hilly and forested, with fewer people living nearby. Further west, the land becomes flatter and more open. These plains are fertile. Farming depends heavily on the river here. Crops such as wheat, pulses, and cotton are common. The river also supplies drinking water. Over time, canals and reservoirs have extended its reach. Towns and cities along the river rely on it in quiet, everyday ways.Several large dams have been built along the Narmada. The Sardar Sarovar Dam in Gujarat is the most widely known. Others include the Indira Sagar Dam and the Omkareshwar Dam in Madhya Pradesh. These projects generate electricity and supply water for farming and households. They have also changed how the river flows. Over the years, they have been linked to debates about land, displacement, and environmental impact. These discussions continue.The river is also associated with well known natural features. Near Jabalpur, it passes between tall marble cliffs known as the Marble Rocks. Close by, the Dhuandhar Falls send water crashing down in a thick spray, especially during the monsoon. These places are not vast, but they leave an impression. The river here feels contained. The sound carries. The landscape holds it in place.For many people, the Narmada is more than a river. Temples at Maheshwar, Omkareshwar, and Amarkantak draw pilgrims throughout the year. Some people walk the Narmada Parikrama, a long journey along its banks. The river is treated as a living presence. Its course has remained steady for generations. Along its length, belief, settlement, and routine continue to grow around it.","The Narmada is India’s fifth longest river.

Canada at rank eight

Malaysia reach the top nine

The United States at rank ten





Passports are often treated as background documents, noticed only at airports or borders. Yet their strength shapes how easily people can move across the world. Global passport rankings measure this strength by counting how many destinations can be entered without arranging a visa in advance. These include visa-free access, a visa on arrival, and electronic travel authorisation. The higher the number, the fewer barriers a traveller faces. In 2026, the latest Henley Passport Index reports again show a clear gap between the most powerful passports and the rest. The countries at the top benefit from long-standing diplomatic ties, economic stability, and reciprocal agreements.According to the Henley Passport Index ranking, India's passport has become slightly more powerful in 2026, albeit it is still not among the strongest in the world. While rising up to 80th rank, Indian visitors can now enter 55 countries without seeking for a visa in advance or receiving one upon arrival. For travellers, this ranking is about actual freedom more than reputation. They have an impact on cost, planning time, and the speed with which a voyage can be completed when the need or opportunity arises.Singapore holds the top position with access to 192 destinations.This marks its third consecutive year at number one. The passport’s strength reflects the country’s strong diplomatic reach and reputation for stability. While it lost visa-free access to a small number of countries over the past year, it gained entry to Papua New Guinea, keeping its overall score high. Singapore’s role as a financial and transport hub continues to support its global mobility.Japan and South Korea share second place with access to 188 destinations. Both countries have built extensive travel agreements over decades. Their passports benefit from trust built through trade, tourism, and political alignment with many regions. Although neither sits at the very top this year, they remain among the most flexible for short-notice international travel.Denmark, Luxembourg, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland occupy third place with scores of 186. These countries benefit from European Union agreements alongside separate bilateral arrangements. Their citizens can move easily within Europe and beyond. Stability, strong institutions, and consistent foreign policy help maintain this level of access year after year.Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Norway, and the Netherlands all rank fourth with access to 185 destinations. The grouping reflects similar travel privileges rather than shared geography alone. These passports offer broad reach across the Americas, Asia, and Africa, supported by long-established diplomatic networks.Hungary, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and the United Arab Emirates sit at rank five with 184 destinations. The UAE stands out as a newer entrant to the top tier, reflecting rapid diplomatic expansion. The European countries in this group continue to benefit from EU mobility and steady international relations.Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Malta, New Zealand, and Poland share sixth place with 183 destinations. These passports combine regional access with growing global reach. New Zealand’s inclusion highlights how geographic isolation does not prevent strong travel freedom when trust and agreements are in place.Australia, Latvia, Liechtenstein, and the United Kingdom rank seventh with 182 destinations. The UK remains high despite changes to its relationship with the European Union. Its passport still offers wide access, though the pace of expansion has slowed compared with earlier years.Canada joins Iceland and Lithuania at rank eight with access to 181 destinations. Canada’s position reflects steady, rather than growing, mobility. Its passport remains strong for leisure and business travel, even if it no longer leads the rankings.Malaysia ranks ninth with access to 180 destinations. It is the only Southeast Asian country in the top ten besides Singapore. Its passport strength reflects regional agreements and growing international ties, giving its holders broad travel options.The United States rounds out the top ten with access to 179 destinations. While still powerful, its passport has slipped slightly in recent years.

The government is likely to peg the fiscal deficit at 4.3 per cent of GDP in the next financial year beginning April 2026, while continuing with double-digit growth in capital expenditure, rating agency ICRA said in its pre-Budget expectations on Friday.ICRA said it expects a shortfall of about Rs 1.3 lakh crore in net tax revenues in the current fiscal, while non-tax receipts are likely to exceed the 2025-26 Budget target by around Rs 80,000 crore.“Fiscal slippage unlikely in FY2026, if shortfall in receipts is matched by expenditure savings,” it said.According to ICRA, the FY2027 Union Budget will be significant as the government’s focus is expected to shift towards medium-term debt consolidation rather than annual fiscal deficit targets, alongside the rollout of the 16th Finance Commission’s recommendations for the next five years.The agency expects the fiscal deficit to be capped at 4.3 per cent of GDP in FY2027, assuming nominal GDP growth of 9.8 per cent. This would be marginally lower than the Budget Estimate of 4.4 per cent for FY2026.ICRA said the government is likely to raise capital expenditure by 14 per cent to Rs 13.1 lakh crore in FY2027, before fiscal rigidities begin to intensify from FY2028 onwards due to higher committed expenditure linked to the recommendations of the 8th Central Pay Commission on salary and pension revisions for Central government employees and pensioners.Despite the expected moderation in the fiscal deficit-to-GDP ratio, the agency said gross dated market borrowings are projected to rise sharply by 15–16 per cent to Rs 16.9 lakh crore in FY2027. This increase would be driven mainly by higher redemptions, although it could be partly offset through switching of government securities, ICRA added.","ICRA said it expects a shortfall of about Rs 1.3 lakh crore in net tax revenues in the current fiscal.

Infrastructure as a catalyst for industrial growth

‘India Outperforming Emerging Markets’: Economist On India's 7.4% FY26 GDP Growth Estimates

Translating policy intent into global manufacturing competitiveness

(Arnab Basu is Partner and Chief Industries Officer, PwC India)

As India advances towards achieving the government’s vision of Viksit Bharat, Budget 2026 arrives at a poignant moment in the country’s economic journey. Over the past decade, public policy has laid strong structural foundations through reforms, infrastructure expansion and a renewed focus on domestic manufacturing which has collectively reshaped India’s growth trajectory. The task before the upcoming Budget is not to reset direction, but to consolidate gains, deepen execution and ensure that public investment continues to crowd in private capital at scale.At the heart of this agenda lies infrastructure. Sustained public CapEx has been one of the most defining features of recent budgets, supporting growth even amid global uncertainty. Investments in roads, railways, ports, airports and digital infrastructure have improved connectivity, reduced logistics costs and strengthened India’s competitiveness across sectors.The Union Budget FY26 has the opportunity to build further on this momentum by continuing a high level of CapEx allocation, while sharpening focus on project execution, asset monetisation and state-level capacity building. The next phase of infrastructure growth must prioritise outcomes related to productivity gains, faster completion cycles, and stronger linkages between physical and digital networks.Equally important is the role of infrastructure in enabling India’s manufacturing ambitions. The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes, announced over successive Budgets, have begun to yield tangible results across electronics, pharmaceuticals, automotive components and renewable energy equipment. As India seeks to position itself as a trusted manufacturing partner in global value chains, this year’s Budget can focus on refining these schemes—shifting from capacity creation to deeper supply-chain integration, technology adoption and MSME participation. Simplifying compliance, improving access to long-term finance, and strengthening industrial clusters will be critical to sustaining manufacturing competitiveness beyond initial incentives.The manufacturing opportunity in India is both cyclical and structural. While geopolitical realignments and supply-chain diversification are creating near-term openings, domestic demand, urbanisation, and rising incomes provide a long-term anchor. Policy continuity will therefore be key. Measures such as stable customs regimes, faster approvals, and coordinated centre-state frameworks can reinforce investor confidence. Targeted investments in logistics parks, warehousing and multimodal transport can further reduce the cost of manufacturing and exports which has been a long-standing constraint for India’s manufacturing industry.While infrastructure and manufacturing form the core of Budget expectations, the role of technology (especially AI) cannot be overlooked. AI is increasingly becoming a horizontal enabler, enhancing productivity in design, operations, maintenance and supply chain planning across infrastructure and industrial sectors. Budget 2026 can support this transition through targeted incentives for digital adoption, investments in data infrastructure, and skilling programmes that prepare the workforce for technology-enabled manufacturing. The focus should be on practical application rather than experimentation alone, ensuring that AI investments translate into measurable productivity gains.Skilling and human capital development remain another critical lever. Large-scale infrastructure and manufacturing expansion will require a workforce equipped with both technical and digital skills. Building on initiatives such as Skill India and recent efforts to align skilling with industry needs, the Budget can further strengthen public-private partnerships in vocational training, apprenticeships, and continuous upskilling. Ensuring that India’s demographic dividend is absorbed into these sectors will be central to achieving inclusive and sustainable development.From an investor's perspective, policy predictability and fiscal discipline will be crucial. In the past, India has demonstrated that growth-oriented spending can coexist with a credible fiscal consolidation path and the Union Budget FY26 will have to continue this balancing act by maintaining CapEx while managing deficits and debt prudently. According to PwC’s 28th Annual Global CEO Survey: India Perspective, a majority of Indian CEOs remain confident about the country’s economic growth, underpinned by reform stability and sustained public investment. Preserving this confidence will depend on the Budget’s ability to reinforce continuity while addressing emerging execution challenges.Beyond numbers and allocations, this year’s budget will be read as a signal of intent. For global investors, it will indicate how firmly India is committed to strengthening its role in global manufacturing and infrastructure-led growth. For the domestic industry, it will shape decisions on capacity expansion, technology adoption, and long-term investment, while for the states, it will define the contours of cooperative federalism in delivering large-scale projects.The Union Budget FY26 represents an opportunity to reinforce the foundations of Viksit Bharat through steady, purposeful policy action. By sustaining infrastructure investment, deepening manufacturing capabilities and enabling technology-led productivity, the Budget can help ensure that India’s growth story remains resilient and inclusive. As the economy navigates an evolving global landscape, it is this consistency of direction and execution that will preserve momentum and translate ambition into enduring economic outcomes.","At the heart of this agenda lies infrastructure.

Union Budget 2026: What corporate India wants from direct tax reforms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/union-budget-2026-what-corporate-india-wants-from-direct-tax-reforms/articleshow/126559303.cms,"Current provisions permit filing of modified returns following a business reorganisation only where the original return has already been filed before the reorganisation order.

Tax neutrality for fast- track demergers

Clarifying the definition of Associated Enterprises (AEs)

Taxation of buyback proceeds

Boosting employment-linked deductions

TDS rationalisation

Other critical expectations

(Shaily Gupta is a Partner and Aanchal Jain is a Senior Associate at Khaitan & Co. Views expressed are personal.)

As the Union Budget 2026 approaches, expectations are running high across corporate India. This year’s budget assumes added significance as it precedes the implementation of the new Income-tax Act, 2025 (ITA 2025), effective 1 April 2026. While the ITA 2025 has primarily focused on textual and structural simplification, it has largely preserved the substantive tax framework of the erstwhile Income-tax Act, 1961 (ITA 1961). As a result, certain ambiguities, interpretational challenges and policy gaps remain unaddressed. Corporates therefore look to the upcoming Budget for targeted direct tax reforms that can enhance certainty, reduce litigation and support ease of doing business.One of the most pressing issues relates to the tax treatment of fast-track demergers under Section 233 of the Companies Act, 2013. Under the previous law, ambiguity existed on whether tax neutrality for demergers was limited to schemes sanctioned by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) under Sections 230–232, thereby excluding fast-track demergers. These schemes were introduced to simplify and expedite restructuring for small companies and wholly owned subsidiaries by eliminating judicial intervention.Fast-track demergers are similar to NCLT-approved schemes, the only distinction is the approval mechanism. Denying tax neutrality merely because of procedural differences creates an artificial distinction, defeating the objective of the fast-track route. Although the Select Committee on ITA 2025 acknowledged industry representations, the government clarified that fast-track demergers were not intended to be tax neutral as they are not court-monitored, and therefore the valuations can result in tax implications or avoidance. However, these concerns can be effectively addressed through existing anti-avoidance measures, rather than a blanket denial.With the scope of fast-track demergers expanded in September 2025, it is imperative that the definition of “demerger” under Section 2(35) of the ITA 2025 be amended to include fast-track schemes.Transfer pricing compliance hinges on the definition of Associated Enterprises (AEs). Under ITA 2025, the definition has two limbs, participation in “management,” “control,” or “capital” and specified transactional relationships such as loan arrangements, guarantees, provision of intangibles, or exclusive supply of raw materials.Ambiguity exists on whether the second limb can independently establish an AE relationship, without satisfying the foundational participation test. The current wording suggests a potentially expansive interpretation, risking overreach. It should be expressly clarified that transactional relationships alone, without participation in capital, control, or management, do not constitute an AE relationship.Finance Act (No. 2) 2024 altered the taxation of share buybacks by shifting the tax burden from companies to shareholders. Entire buyback proceeds are now taxed as dividend income, irrespective of accumulated profits and without allowing deductions, while the cost of acquisition is treated as a capital loss (eligible for set-off). This departs from the deemed dividend framework, where taxation is limited to accumulated profits.A more balanced approach would be to tax buyback proceeds as dividends only to the extent of accumulated profits, with the balance treated as sale consideration and taxed as capital gains.Additionally, shareholders should be permitted to deduct expenses incurred in relation to buyback proceeds, consistent with the treatment of other dividend income.Section 146 of ITA 2025 [corresponding section 80JJAA of ITA 1961] allow a deduction of 30% of additional employee costs for three years, but only for new employees earning up to INR 25,000 per month, a limit unchanged since 2016. Given wage inflation, this limit requires upward revision to ensure relevance and effectiveness in promoting employment.Timelines for income tax returns in business reorganisationsCurrent provisions permit filing of modified returns following a business reorganisation only where the original return has already been filed before the reorganisation order. Where the order is passed close to the due date of filing return, taxpayers face compliance challenges. A uniform six months window from the order date in all cases would bring much-needed certainty.The ever-expanding scope and complexity of TDS provisions impose significant compliance burdens. Multiple rates, frequent classification disputes and reconciliation challenges across Form 26AS/AIS, income tax returns, GST filings and financial statements, often lead to mismatches and potential denial of credit. A clear roadmap to rationalise TDS rates and simplify compliance processes is essential to reduce litigation and improve ease of doing business.Clarity is also sought for foreign component manufacturers who store goods in India for just-in-time supply, without transferring ownership. A safe harbour proposed in Budget 2025, remains unnotified and should be operationalised. Similarly, loan waivers pursuant to insolvency resolution under the IBC should be excluded from taxable income and TDS applicability, to preserve a clean slate to revived businesses.As Budget 2026 approaches, these targeted reforms can significantly reinforce India’s commitment for a stable and business-friendly tax regime.","The Union Budget 2026 approaches, expectations are running high across corporate India.

‘Daily Struggle To Survive’: Lawyer Exposes Grim Reality For Air India Crash Families





: The families of nine British victims of the AI 171 June 12, 2025 plane crash are suing Air India in the London high court.The families have filed a joint legal claim for personal injury and damages in the King’s Bench Division through their law firm.James Healy-Pratt, aviation partner at Keystone Law, said: “High court proceedings have been issued against Air India but have not yet been formally served on them. This is against the backdrop of upcoming confidential negotiations in London. Hopefully the parties will resolve their claims through such dialogue without the need for a trial.”When contacted by TOI, Air India declined to comment.The Boeing 787 crashed in Ahmedabad shortly after take-off; 241 of the 242 people on board perished.Mariam Javed Ali Syed (35) a brand ambassador at Harrods, and her husband Javed Ali Syed (37), manager at the Best Western Kensington Olympia Hotel, and their children, Zayn (6) and Amani (4), died in the crash. The family had gone to India to celebrate Eid and look after Javed’s mother, Farida. A claim has been brought by Syeda Minnat, the administrator of Mariam’s estate, and two relatives, Sadaf Javed and Syed Ali Hassan.Ramesh Hirani (51), the founder of Reset From Diabetes, was in India developing a wellness project when his life was cut short. He left a wife, Tina, and their three children. His claim is being brought by his brother Pritesh Hirani (53) and his mother Amarbai Hirani.Ashok Patel (74) and his wife Shobhanaben Patel (71), from Gujarat, who had settled in the UK in 1978, died on the Gatwick-bound flight. They had gone to India on a spiritual pilgrimage. Their sons Miten and Hemit Patel are bringing the legal action.Ketan Kumar Shah Bharatbhai (43), from Dorset, had come to India to visit his sick father in Padra, Vadodara. A claim is being brought by his wife Megha and two children, Vyom and Yhavi.Lawrence Christian (30), from Maninagar, Gujarat, who was living in London, had gone to India to perform the last rites for his father, Daniel, and was killed on his return home. His wife, Ayushi, is bringing the legal action.Last July Air India announced an interim payment of Rs 25 lakh to the families of all the deceased passengers, and to Viswashkumar Ramesh, the sole survivor of the crash, which would be adjusted against any final compensation.Ramesh (39) is now back in Leicester. He is using a different law firm and is not involved in this HC case. His spokesperson, Sanjiv Patel, told TOI: “Mr Ramesh’s legal claim remains ongoing, and he is currently undergoing rehabilitation. Our focus remains on his recovery, with appropriate care and support being coordinated.”","Families of nine British victims of the AI 171 June 12, 2025 plane crash are suing Air India in the London high court.

Merge Labs vs Neuralink





ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has announced an investment in Merge Labs, a brain-computer interface (BCI) startup which was founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Rival to Elon Musk ’s Neuralink, the mission of Merge Labs is to develop safe and scaleable brain-computer interfaces. “We are excited to support and collaborate with Merge Labs as they turn an ambitious idea into reality and ultimately products that are useful for people,” said the company.OpenAI revealed that funding made by the company will support Merge Labs’ mission of creating safe, scalable brain-computer interfaces that could one day allow humans to interact with artificial intelligence directly through neural signals. The company has not yet disclosed the size of the investment, but the partnership underscores OpenAI’s growing interest in technologies that extend beyond software into hardware and human augmentation.Merge Labs is a research lab with the long-term mission of bridging biological and artificial intelligence to maximize human ability, agency, and experience. It is developing fundamentally new approaches⁠ (opens in a new window) to BCIs that are safe and interface with the brain at much higher bandwidth by combining biology, devices, and AI.The company is focused on creating non-invasive neural interfaces that can translate brain activity into digital commands.

MrBeast’s 'Beast Industries' hits $5 billion valuation, but personal liquidity tells a different story



MrBeast’s Forbes net worth vs. personal cash



MrBeast: “I actually have negative money”



Focus on reinvesting, not personal savings



High-cost decisions driven by time constraints



MrBeast borrowed money for his wedding



Multiple ventures under the MrBeast brand







Jimmy Donaldson, widely known as MrBeast, is one of the most well-known people on YouTube. He runs a business and content empire that reaches hundreds of millions of people around the world, and he's only 27. His videos often have big challenges, giving back, and record-breaking prize money. People often think that MrBeast is personally wealthy in the traditional sense, with lots of money on hand, because of how he looks to the public. But a recent interview has brought a different side of his financial situation to light. Donaldson was honest about money and said that even though the company he started is worth billions, his own bank account tells a very different story.He said he has ""negative money"" and is currently borrowing money, even for big life events. His comments have brought attention to the differences between startup valuations, equity ownership, and personal liquidity, especially for founders who keep putting money into growth. The conversation gives us a better idea of how digital businesses work today and how money is often tied up on paper instead of cash.Beast Industries, MrBeast's main business, is at the heart of what he does.As per a report from Fortune in September 2025, the company is now worth $5 billion. Donaldson owns a little more than half of the company, which gives him a big stake in it. Beast Industries runs a number of businesses, such as making big YouTube videos, creating branded content, and making consumer goods. The value takes into account the company's reach, potential for revenue, and high levels of audience engagement across platforms.But the value of a company is not the same as the cash it has on hand. A valuation is what investors think the business is worth based on how much money it will make and how fast it will grow in the future. It is not the amount of money the founder has to spend every day.Forbes said that MrBeast's net worth was $85 million in June 2025. This number includes the worth of his stake in Beast Industries and other things he owns. Donaldson has made it clear that most of this net worth is in stocks and not cash.He talked about common ideas about his wealth in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. He said that a lot of people think he is a billionaire, but that is because they mix up his net worth with his available cash. He said that it is not easy to use equity in a company for everyday expenses unless it is sold or converted, which he has decided not to do.Donaldson said something very interesting about his finances during the interview. He said, ""I really... I have negative money right now."" I am borrowing money. He also said that if you take away the equity value of his company, many viewers would technically have more money in their bank accounts than he does.He gave a simple example to explain the situation, saying that company equity can't be used to buy basic things like breakfast. This comment made it clear that there is a difference between wealth on paper and money you can actually spend.Donaldson said that his focus on work and growth affects how he handles his money. He said he doesn't think about his bank balance very often. Instead, he is focused on making videos and growing his businesses.He has said many times that a lot of the money he makes goes back into making more content. He says that spending on making content alone is expected to reach about $250 million in one year. This model of reinvesting in productions allows for more complicated works, bigger prizes, and higher production standards, which are now a defining feature of his brand.Donaldson has made some expensive spending choices when he needed to, even though he keeps a small personal account. He told one story about how he rented a private jet to see his fiancée, Thea Booysen, who was studying in the UK at the time.He said that because of where he lived and when he worked, commercial travel took a lot of time. It took a long drive and a lot of layovers to get to a big airport. Donaldson says that a private jet cut down on travel time a lot, which meant he could keep working without losing almost a whole day to travel. The flight is said to have cost about $150,000.Donaldson told people on social media in June 2025 that he had borrowed money from his mother to help pay for his wedding. He said that this happened because he put most of his money back into his businesses.He also pointed out how ironic it was that he owned companies worth billions of dollars but still needed short-term personal loans. He said again that even though the businesses look very valuable on paper, that value doesn't always turn into cash that you can use for yourself.Donaldson's business portfolio includes several big projects, not just YouTube videos. One of them is ""Beast Games,"" a competition series that gave its first-season winner $10 million, which is one of the biggest single prizes in entertainment history. Feastables is another important business. It's a consumer brand that focuses on chocolate and snack foods, and it has grown quickly in retail markets.All of these projects need a lot of money up front. Donaldson's strategy of reinvesting rather than taking personal income is supported by high operating costs, which come from prize money, production costs, staffing, and logistics.","Jimmy Donaldson, widely known as MrBeast, is one of the most well-known people on YouTube.

Record spending planned as global health indicators worsen

Bill Gates No Longer among Top 10 Billionaires: The Real Reason





Bill Gates has started putting in place the first major steps toward closing the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, one of the world’s most-influential philanthropic organisations. The foundation recently announced that it will spend a record $9 billion in 2026, its highest annual budget so far, while also preparing to cut up to 500 staff positions over the next five years. According to a Fortune report, these moves follow Gates’ decision last year to formally wind down the foundation by 2045, after spending roughly $200 billion over two decades.The latest plan marks a significant shift for the foundation at a time when many of its long-term focus areas — including global health, poverty, and US education — are under pressure due to cuts in international aid.Gates Foundation was established in 2000 as a nonprofit fighting poverty, disease, and inequity around the world. Bill Gates and his former -wife are among the top donators to the foundation. Together, they contributed $60.2 billion to the endowment through 2024. Warren Buffett, who is a former trustee and a clsowe friend of Gates donated $43.3 billion from 2006 to 2024.The foundation’s board has approved a cap on operating costs, limiting them to $1.25 billion a year, or about 14% of its budget.To meet that limit, the organisation will reduce its workforce from the current 2,375 roles, including by leaving some positions unfilled.Foundation CEO Mark Suzman said the reductions will be gradual:“We will do this thoughtfully, carefully, and systematically … We’ll be recalibrating it every year. That 500-person target is a maximum target. I very much hope that we won’t have to do it as large as that number.”Suzman said operating costs were projected to reach 18% by 2030 if no action was taken.The $9 billion budget for 2026 includes increases for programmes focused on women’s health, vaccines, polio, AI tools, and education. Gates recently wrote that global health indicators slipped last year, noting that child deaths increased for the first time in two decades.“The next five years will be difficult as we try to get back on track and work to scale up new lifesaving tools,” Gates wrote. Still, he said he remains optimistic about long-term progress.The foundation plans to accelerate spending in three key areas:• maternal and child health• infectious disease prevention• poverty reductionNotably, Bill Gates has repeatedly warned about risks from artificial intelligence (AI) but is also investing in its development. The foundation joined a coalition pledging $1 billion toward AI tools for public-sector workers in the U.S.AI remains one of the programmes that will continue to grow, Suzman confirmed.The foundation is also expanding operations in Africa and India, creating a new division focused on the two regions. Work on HIV and tuberculosis will increasingly shift from Seattle to Africa.Despite its planned closure, Suzman said the foundation still has two decades to operate and aims to make its most significant impact during that time.“We are moving into what I believe is going to be the most impactful period of the Gates Foundation,” he said.","Gates Foundation was established in 2000 as a nonprofit fighting poverty, disease, and inequity around the world.

Building in Riyadh Just Got Easier: Inside the New Digital Platform Transforming City Planning

Transparency, efficiency and urban growth



Saudi Arabia Goes Full Smart City: Riyadh Launches One-Stop Digital Urban Planning Hub





In a major leap towards smart governance and efficient city development, Riyadh Municipality has rolled out a unified digital system designed to drastically accelerate urban planning approvals across Saudi Arabia ’s capital. Announced this week, the platform aims to simplify complex bureaucratic processes, reduce paperwork and bring transparency to urban plan submissions for developers, planners and investors alike.The initiative comes amid surging demand for housing and real estate development in Riyadh, where rapid population growth and Vision 2030-driven transformation have put pressure on traditional planning systems. By centralising approvals, Riyadh Municipality is addressing key bottlenecks that previously delayed construction, land use decisions and infrastructure projects.The newly launched system brings all relevant municipal authorities together into a single digital planning approval platform. Previously, developers had to navigate multiple agencies, each with its own procedures and timelines, which often resulted in prolonged delays, duplicated reviews and confusion about status updates.Under the digital platform, applicants can now:By aligning all committees and departments on one system, the process reduces overlaps and conflicting requirements, giving developers a clearer view of what’s needed at every step.For Saudi Arabia’s booming real estate sector, the platform represents a game-changer. Faster approvals mean quicker housing development, enhanced investor confidence and the ability to respond rapidly to market demand. Real estate stakeholders have welcomed the clarity and predictability that the digital route offers, noting that clear technical guidelines and a unified process reduce guesswork and administrative friction.Officials also say the digital platform enhances quality control by verifying infrastructure readiness such as utilities, road access and service networks, at each stage before final approvals are issued. This helps ensure that new developments are functional and sustainable long before construction begins.One of the most significant benefits of the unified system is process transparency. Applicants can now follow the exact approval status of their submissions, see where reviews are held up and understand specific requirements, eliminating much of the uncertainty that once surrounded urban planning in Riyadh.This transparency not only improves user experience but also aligns with broader digital transformation goals across Saudi Arabia. As part of the Kingdom’s push toward smart governance, such systems contribute to efficient public services, higher satisfaction rates and streamlined interactions between the government and private sectors.The unified planning platform is just one example of Saudi Arabia’s digital governance strategy. Riyadh Municipality recently ranked high in the Digital Transformation Index, reflecting its success in adopting modern technologies and enhancing user experiences across municipal services.Other initiatives, like the “15-Minute Index” in the MyCity/Madiniti app, are designed to help residents find nearby services quickly, further embedding digital solutions into everyday urban life in the capital. By improving quality of life and boosting service accessibility, these efforts support Riyadh’s Vision 2030 objectives — including sustainable urban growth, improved infrastructure and a competitive environment for investment and innovation.Riyadh’s unified digital urban planning system marks a turning point in how cities manage growth and development. By replacing fragmented, multi-agency approvals with a single, transparent digital pathway, the capital is not just speeding up real estate projects; it is reshaping how residents, developers and authorities interact in a future-ready city ecosystem.As Riyadh continues to evolve into a global hub driven by technology, sustainability and smart governance, the new platform exemplifies how digital transformation can translate directly into better cities and improved quality of urban life.","Riyadh Municipality has rolled out a unified digital system designed to drastically accelerate urban planning approvals across Saudi Arabia ’s capital.

"Trump says he wants to keep Hassett in White House, clouding Fed chair selection",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trump-says-he-wants-to-keep-hassett-in-white-house-clouding-fed-chair-selection/articleshow/126602180.cms,"AP image

President Donald Trump on Friday said he would like to keep his top economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, at the White House rather than potentially nominate him to replace Jerome Powell as chair of the Federal Reserve.""I actually want to keep you where you are, if you want to know the truth,"" Trump said at a White House event, when he saw Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, in the audience. ""I just want to thank you, you were fantastic on television the other day.""Trump's comments, while not clearly definitive, have upended expectations around the extensive search the White House has undergone to find a new Fed chair, one of the most powerful financial positions in the world. The president's remarks have boosted the prospects for Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor and already a top contender for the position.Hassett has generally been seen as the front-runner in the race to replace Powell because he has worked for Trump since his first presidential term. Last month, Trump referred to Hassett as a ""potential Fed chair.""Powell's term as chair will end May 15, though he could take the unusual step of remaining on the board as governor afterward.Trump appointed Powell in 2018 but soon soured on him for raising the Fed's key interest rate that year.Warsh's candidacy has also likely been boosted by the Justice Department's subpoenas of the Federal Reserve last week, revealed Sunday in an unusually direct video statement by Powell. The Fed chair charged that the subpoenas were essentially punishment for the central bank's refusal to lower interest rates as sharply as Trump would like.The criminal investigation - a first for a sitting Fed chair - sparked pushback on Capitol Hill, with many Republican senators dismissing the idea that Powell could have committed a crime. The subpoenas related to testimony Powell gave last June before the Senate Banking Committee that touched on a $2.5 billion building renovation project.The backlash has intensified concerns in the Senate, analysts say, that the Trump administration is seeking to undermine the Fed's independence from day-to-day politics. That, in turn, may reduce Hassett's prospects.The brouhaha over the subpoenas is ""making it harder to confirm Hassett, who is distinctively close to the president,"" Krishna Guha, an analyst at investment bank Evercore ISI, wrote in a client note. ""Warsh is trusted by Senate Republicans and would be much easier to confirm.""Yet Warsh, historically, is known as a ""hawk,"" or someone who traditionally supports higher interest rates to ward off inflation, as opposed to a ""dove,"" or someone who prefers lower borrowing costs to spur hiring and growth.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose Friday, to just above 4.2%, from about 4.17% Thursday. The increase likely reflected a sense that Warsh's chances had improved, and as a result the Fed would be less likely over time to cut rates than under a Hassett chairmanship.","President Donald Trump said he would like to keep his top economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, at the White House.

‘Can start a new chapter’: Iran's exiled crown prince Reza Pahlavi hails ties with India- what he said,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/can-start-a-new-chapter-irans-exiled-crown-prince-reza-pahlavi-hails-ties-with-india-what-he-said/articleshow/126600597.cms,".





Reza Pahlavi, Iran’s exiled crown prince , on Friday spoke about India–Iran ties and future cooperation, while speaking about the ongoing protests against Iran’s clerical leadership.Speaking at a news conference, Pahlavi said India and Iran shared a relationship that went back decades. Recalling earlier ties, he said former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had visited Iran when he was very young.“I remember those days,” he said, adding that the connection between the two countries has long been cultural and historical.Pahalvi said the relationship has remained strong even in modern times. “In modern history, we have had a very, very good relationship,” he said.The exiled crown prince further said that a democratic Iran would naturally seek close ties with countries that respect sovereignty and liberty. “A democratic Iran is committed to having the best possible relationship with countries that share the same values,” he said.Pahlavi said India’s history and heritage made it a natural partner for deeper cooperation. “There is a rich history that I observe in India,” he said, adding that this could form the basis of a strong bond between the two nations.Pahalvi further described India as a leader in technology and expertise, particularly in renewable energy and information technology. “India is one of the leading countries when it comes to tech and expertise,” he said, expressing hope that experts from both sides could work closely in the future.He said a new phase of ties could begin once Iran was free. “Hopefully, once we are freed, we can start a new chapter,” he said.Reza Pahlavi is the eldest son of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Iran’s last shah, who was overthrown during the 1979 Islamic Revolution. He has lived in exile since the fall of the monarchy. He has been a prominent voice calling for protests to continue in the country.Iran has been witnessing widespread anti-government protests for over two weeks. What began as demonstrations over economic distress has expanded into broader calls for political change and an end to the country’s theocratic system. Protests have spread across several cities despite heavy security deployment, internet restrictions and mass arrests.","Reza Pahlavi, Iran’s exiled crown prince, spoke about India–Iran ties and future cooperation, while speaking about the ongoing protests.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.
