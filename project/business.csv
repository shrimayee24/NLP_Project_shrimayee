Officials admitted that the growing stock is a matter of concern.The paddy procurement by govt agencies has crossed 686 lakh tonne, which translates to 459 lakh tonne in terms of rice, in the current season. This is around 7% lower than the same period in the last financial year.

"Hindu Marriage Act: Hindu marriage invalid without customary rituals, SC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hindu-marriage-invalid-without-customary-rituals-sc/articleshow/109763530.cms,"NEW DELHI: Observing that a Hindu marriage is a sacred process and not a “song and dance” and “wining and dining” event, Supreme Court has held that customary rituals and ceremonies prescribed under the Hindu Marriage Act must be assiduously, strictly and religiously followed, failing which a marriage would be declared invalid even after it has been registered.A SC bench said Section 7 of the Act lists ‘ceremonies of a Hindu marriage’, which have to be complied with for validity of the marriage and if it is not done, then the marriage is not deemed valid in the eye of the law. Section 7 says a Hindu marriage may be solemnised in accordance with the customary rites and ceremonies of either party thereto.A Hindu marriage is not an event for “song and dance”, “wining and dining” or a commercial transaction , the Supreme Court has observed and said it cannot be recognised in the “absence of a valid ceremony” under the Hindu Marriage Act. A bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and Augustine George Masih said a Hindu marriage is a ‘samskara’ and a sacrament which has to be accorded its status as an institution of great value in Indian society.In its recent order passed in the matter of two trained commercial pilots, who sought a divorce decree without performing a valid Hindu marriage ceremony, the bench urged young men and women to “think deeply about the institution of marriage even before they enter upon it and as to how sacred the said institution is, in Indian society”.“A marriage is not an event for ‘song and dance’ and ‘wining and dining’ or an occasion to demand and exchange dowry and gifts by undue pressure leading to possible initiation of criminal proceedings thereafter. A marriage is not a commercial transaction. It is a solemn foundational event celebrated so as to establish a relationship between a man and a woman who acquire the status of a husband and wife for an evolving family in future which is a basic unit of Indian society,” the bench said.Terming the marriage as sacred as it provides a lifelong, dignity-affirming, equal, consensual and healthy union of two individuals, the bench said a Hindu marriage facilitates procreation, consolidates the unit of family and solidifies the spirit of fraternity within various communities.“We deprecate the practice of young men and women seeking to acquire the status of being a husband and a wife to each other and therefore purportedly being married, in the absence of a valid marriage ceremony under the provisions of the (Hindu Marriage) Act such as in the instant case where the marriage between the parties was to take place later,” the bench said.In its April 19 order, the bench said where a Hindu marriage is not performed in accordance with the applicable rites or ceremonies such as ‘saptapadi’ (taking seven steps by the groom and the bride jointly before the sacred fire), the marriage will not be construed as a Hindu marriage.“We further observe that a Hindu marriage is a sacrament and has a sacred character. In the context of saptapadi in a Hindu marriage, according to Rig Veda, after completing the seventh step (saptapadi) the bridegroom says to his bride, ‘With seven steps we have become friends (sakha). May I attain to friendship with thee; may I not be separated from thy friendship’. A wife is considered to be half of oneself (ardhangini) but to be accepted with an identity of her own and to be a co-equal partner in the marriage,” it said. In Hindu Law , marriage is a sacrament or a ‘samskara’ and it is the foundation for a new family, the bench noted, and said, “There is nothing like a “better-half” in a marriage but the spouses are equal halves in a marriage.”Observing that with the passage of centuries and the enactment of the Act, monogamy is the only legally approved form of relationship between a husband and a wife. “The (Hindu Marriage) Act has categorically discarded polyandry and polygamy and all other such types of relationships. The intent of the Parliament is also that there should be only one form of marriage having varied rites and customs and rituals,” it said.","A Hindu marriage is not an event for “song and dance”, “wining and dining” or a commercial transaction, the Supreme Court has observed. A Hindu marriage cannot be recognised in the “absence of a valid ceremony” under the Hindu Marriage Act.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109763532,imgsize-778899,width-400,resizemode-4/109763532.jpg"

"'Desperate & lying': BJP, Congress echo each other’s tone and tenor",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/desperate-lying-bjp-congress-echo-each-others-tone-and-tenor/articleshow/109795698.cms,"BJP to Congress: You are desperate, lying

(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge has written to PM Narendra Modi that his letter to NDA candidates betrays a desperation, and he wants the candidates to “amplify lies” because his own lies are not having the effect he had hoped.Kharge said the claim that Congress will snatch the reservation of SC/ST/OBC is a “blatant lie” because people know it is RSS that is opposing reservations since they were introduced post-Independence, and now BJP leaders are saying that openly in the campaign.He said the PM should instead clarify why he is opposed to giving reservation in proportion to population.Kharge said Modi has asked candidates to talk about Congress snatching people’s wealth by bringing ‘inheritance tax’ when no such issue has been mentioned in the party manifesto and when it is a fact that BJP has looted Rs 10 crore from farmers in Gujarat for electoral bonds, and collected over Rs 8,000 crore in all.“From the tone and content of the letter it seems that there is a lot of desperation and worry in you which is leading you to use language that does not suit the office of the PM. Repeating a lie a thousand times will not make it the truth,” the Congress president said, citing the PM’s letter to all NDA candidates about what they need to communicate to the voters.Kharge challenged the PM for a debate on the Congress manifesto and concluded his letter saying, “when the elections are over, people will only remember you as the PM who indulged in divisive and communal speeches filled with lies to avoid an inevitable defeat.”He goes on to talk about the guarantees in the Congress manifesto focussed on the rights of the youth, women, farmers, labour force and the empowerment of the poor. “Our guarantee is Nyay to all,”Kharge emphasises. “We have heard you and the home minister say that Congress is practising appeasement politics. The only appeasement policy that we have seen in the last 10 years is the appeasement of Chinese by you and your ministers,” Kharge said.“Even today, you refuse to call China as ‘ghuspaithiye (intruder)’, instead on June 19, 2020, you said ‘na koi ghusa hai, na hi koi ghus aaya hai’, insulting the supreme sacrifice of 20 Indian soldiers in Galwan. “Your public ‘Clean Chit’ to China, has weakened India’s case and made it more belligerent,” he added.Kharge goes on to highlight that the PM has appealed to BJP workers to mobilise voters in the name of religion. “It is better as the PM if you seek votes on the performance of your government over the last ten years instead of indulging in hate speeches,” the Congress President states.Congress has been carrying out a “desperate campaign of lies, misinformation and appeasement politics” for votes in the Lok Sabha polls as it is left with no other option after having betrayed the people’s trust repeatedly during its rule in the past, BJP alleged on Thursday.Addressing a press conference here at the BJP headquarters, Union minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar said PM Narendra Modi has put the country on the path of progress in the last 10 years and India became the third largest economy in the world under his leadership from the “fragile five” during the UPA rule.“Congress, which was given multiple opportunities by the people to serve them, has betrayed their trust repeatedly and is today left with no other alternative but (to carry out) a desperate campaign of lies, misinformation and appeasement politics,” he said.While the BJP’s campaign for the 2024 Lok Sabha polls is based on the “performance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi”, Congress is not speaking a word on the 10 years of the UPA rule but is spreading lies on various issues including reservation to SCs, STs and OBCs, Chandrasekhar said.The BJP functionary dismissed as false propaganda Congress’ claim that BJP was seeking 400-plus seats in the parliamentary polls because it wants to change the Constitution and end the provisions made to provide reservation to the SCs, STs and OBCs.He alleged that the Congress is trying to build a “false narrative”. It is spreading this “lie” while visiting every archbishop, Christians and Muslims, he charged.“We protect the reservation. They want to provide religion-based quota to which BJP is completely against. The people are aware of this fundamental difference between the BJP-led NDA and the Congress,” he added.Chandrasekhar also took on Congress over its “redistribution of wealth” poll promise and said, “At a time when we are making policies to empower the youth and enable them to achieve their aspirational goals, Congress has brought Marxist economic policy of redistribution of wealth.”Addressing the press conference, BJP national spokesperson Sayed Zafar Islam highlighted the Modi government’s achievements in the last 10 years and hit out at the Congress over its claim of growing inequality during NDA rule.“The Indian economy is growing at a faster pace. Congress and its economists talk about equality and inequality while in reality, inequality is the lowest in the country today,” he said.“While there was double digit inflation during UPA rule, it is the lowest at 3.2 per cent today. PM Modi controlled inflation and did not let it rise in the last 10 years,” the BJP functionary said.",Mallikarjun Kharge has written to PM Narendra Modi that his letter to NDA candidates betrays a desperation. He wants the candidates to ‘amplify lies’ because his own lies are not having the effect he had hoped.

HYDERABAD: Honoured two years ago with Padma Shri for reinventing the rare musical instrument 'Kinnera', Darshanam Mogulaiah was recently spotted toiling as a daily wager at a construction site in Turkayamjal near Hyderabad. Life struck another jarring note when a post-award grant of Rs 1 crore in cash from the Telangana govt was spent on family exigencies, leaving the 73-year-old artiste popular as "" Kinnera Mogulaiah"" struggling for two square meals.Mogulaiah outlines the reasons for the descent from the stage of the fourth-highest civilian award in 2022 to the construction site in Turkayamjal. ""One of my sons suffers from seizures. For medicines (son and myself) alone I need at least Rs 7,000 a month. Then there are regular medical tests and other expenses,"" Mogulaiah, father to nine children, told TOI. Three of his kids died from ailments; three are married; three others are still students and dependent on Mogulaiah.The artiste's wife passed away four years ago. ""I tried to reach out to multiple people for work. People sympathised and politely turned me away. All hailed me for my glorious past and even gave me small amounts, but I got no employment,"" said Mogulaiah.Matters weren't so grim earlier. ""I used that money (Rs 1 crore state grant) for my children's weddings. I even bought a piece of land in Turkayamjal. I started building a house but had to stop midway as I ran out of funds,"" said Mogulaiah.Things got especially tough when a Rs 10,000 monthly honorarium sanctioned by the state was discontinued recently, rued the artiste, not sure why it happened.I have been making the rounds of govt offices and meeting public representatives for help. All respond positively but do nothing. What's worse, many people click photos with me and circulate them saying I am begging for existence. It is very painful,"" Mogulaiah said.Along with the 1 crore grant, the state had also announced a 600-square yard plot in Rangareddy district for the artiste. The allotment is still pending.""I visited the Rangareddy collector's office three times. Every time, there is a new collector. They receive me well, enquire about my well-being and tell me that they will soon allot land near Hayathnagar. Nothing has happened so far. I met the Hayathnagar tahsildar. He told me the decision is pending with the collector,"" said the septuagenarian, bemoaning the alleged red tape.Recently, the Kinnera player even met chief minister A Revanth Reddy and deputy CM Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka. ""The CM directed me to minister Konda Surekha and promised to take care of my concerns. I am waiting for a decision,"" Mogulaiah said.One silver lining marks the roller-coaster ride. ""Thanks to VC Sajjanar, managing director of TSRTC, I at least have a bus pass to travel for free,"" Mogulaiah quipped.","Darshanam Mogulaiah was recently spotted toiling as a daily wager at a construction site in Turkayamjal near Hyderabad.

"What is a forest, really? On Haryana govt's table for the first time, criteria to define it",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/what-is-a-forest-really-on-haryana-govts-table-for-the-first-time-criteria-to-define-it/articleshow/109800504.cms,"GURGAON: Haryana has for the first time come up with criteria to define a 'forest' - a move that could pave the way for a long-pending exercise to identify areas, particularly in the Aravalis , that will get legal protection either under Supreme Court orders or provisions of the Forest Conservation Act.A forest official told TOI on Thursday that according to the proposal submitted by the forest department to the state govt, an area with ""5 hectares or more of uninterrupted forest-like elements"" will be recognised as a ' deemed forest '.If the state govt approves the proposal, the forest department will form committees in every district to identify deemed forests. ""As per the proposal, a minimum of 5 hectares of continuous patch will be considered as deemed forest if it has forest-like elements,"" the official said.Haryana's move comes after the Supreme Court on Feb 19 told the Centre and all states to go by the broader ""dictionary definition"" of forest as given in its 1996 ruling in the TN Godavarman vs Union of India case, irrespective of last year's amendments in the Forest (Conservation) Act that defined afresh what would be treated as a forest.The FCA amendment excluded all areas that were not recorded or identified as 'forest' in govt records as of Oct 25, 1980. This change, experts had said, violated the 1996 SC ruling that defined forest as per dictionary meaning and not necessarily areas based on official records.The top court in its Feb order also directed that all states must forward to the Union environment ministry reports made by expert committees after the 1996 ruling. These committees were supposed to identify all forests under the dictionary definition, but compliance lacks 27 years on.TOI had reported in March that Haryana govt formed a committee in 1997 to identify and record 'deemed forest' but the norms weren't followed. The panel worked for a few months but never published a report or submitted it to the environment ministry, a govt source had said.Asked why it was coming up with criteria when the Supreme Court had already given a definition, the forest official said on Thursday that all states have different types of forests and will need to come up with their own set of rules that make a forest.""Large patches of Aravalis will be included in this exercise. The criteria have been made considering forest categories of Haryana, including sub-tropical thorny forest of Aravalis, tropical dry deciduous forest and subtropical pine forest areas,"" the official added.Coming up with criteria is then the first step to identify 'deemed forest' and give it protection under FCA, which bars construction and human activities, the forest department said.""We are awaiting govt's approval to begin the process of demarcating 'deemed forest' category. We are optimistic about receiving the nod soon since the matter is in the Supreme Court,"" said Pankaj Goyal, principal chief conservator of forests, Haryana.The exercise is crucial for Haryana as it has the lowest forest cover - just 3.6% of its area -- among all Indian states. This is partially because over half of the Aravalis - more than 1 lakh hectares - in Haryana are not recognised as forests. Instead, Aravali lands are owned by panchayats, urban bodies or private owners. The only Aravali areas protected by FCA are those notified under the Punjab Land Preservation Act (PLPA) and the Aravali Notification of 1992.In April this year, Haryana govt submitted to the environment ministry data about reserve forests, protected forests, wildlife sanctuaries, national parks, PLPA land, and Aravali plantations, but not all forest areas under dictionary definition.Experts underscored the importance of identifying forests in Haryana.","Haryana has for the first time come up with criteria to define a 'forest' The move could pave the way for a long-pending exercise to identify areas that will get legal protection.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

"In jobless Canada, student dreams end in debt and drugs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/in-jobless-canada-student-dreams-end-in-debt-and-drugs/articleshow/109742538.cms,"When the going gets tough, the young and restless look for a high elsewhere, just to stay afloat. This is the case for numerous students from various regions of India who have gone to Canada in pursuit of education and jobs. The unemployment crisis in the land they once hoped would offer prosperity and success has plunged many students into a perilous spiral of drug and alcohol abuse, alongside heightened levels of depression and a surge in therapy sessions, according to Canada-based counsellors TOI spoke with.The counsellors said students are turning to marijuana and cocaine, hallucinogenic drugs like Ecstasy, and opioids like Fentanyl as a coping mechanism against unemployment-induced stress. They reported a monthly average of five to eight cases over the past few months.One student from Badlapur in Maharashtra, currently in British Columbia’s Burnaby city for a degree in environmental science, said the realisation that even degree-holding seniors were relegated to paid-by-the-hour gig workers drove him to depression.“In my second semester, I saw seniors around me doing ad hoc jobs to get by. It stressed me out, and I started to believe I’d meet a similar fate. I started smoking, then alcohol, and eventually marijuana,” the 25-year-old said.After failing a semester, he sought professional help from a psychologist and is currently undergoing treatment. However, therapy sessions are expensive — each session ranging from Canadian $70 to $150 (Rs 4,249 to Rs 9000-odd) or more.“Earlier, addiction cases were predominantly among students from Punjab, Haryana, and Jharkhand. Now, we see students from Bengal, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana reaching out for help,” said a counsellor of Indian origin practising in Richmond, British Columbia. The counsellors chose to stay anonymous to respect the patient confidentiality agreement.There are currently around 3 lakh Indian students , according to Canadian Bureau for International Education. Many of them take loans, ranging from Rs 20 lakh to Rs 40 lakh on average, to enrol in universities and colleges in Canada. But the transition from campus to corporate life appears bleak as Canada’s unemployment rate stood at 6.1% in March.Still, students find ways to fund their addiction, including deceiving family members back home or working multiple odd jobs. “My former roommate has moved in with four others in a crammed accommodation. He stopped eating either at home or outside, works multiple shifts, and rides a bicycle to faraway locations,” said a 27-year-old in Vancouver. “Drug dealers extend credit, knowing they’d come back for more.”A counsellor from Delta, British Columbia, shared the story of a patient who had moved to Richmond from a town near Kolkata in 2021.“He finished his master’s degree in June 2023. Following that, he worked at a restaurant and a convenience store to cover his expenses. The frustration of being unable to support his family back home led him to recreational drugs,” the counsellor said.His addiction swirled out of control last year. “He stopped eating, left his jobs, and began ingesting drugs regularly. His roommates reached out to his distant cousin, who brought him to me. Since Dec 2023, he has been undergoing rehab,” the counsellor said.Many students are left vulnerable to self-harm. “I’ve had suicidal thoughts over the prospect of being unable to repay my loan.

Foreign and student visa applications to UK plummet as tough new curbs kick in,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/foreign-and-student-visa-applications-to-uk-plummet-as-tough-new-curbs-kick-in/articleshow/109762574.cms,"LONDON: The UK government ’s plan to cut legal migration appears to be working, new figures published by the home office show.The total number of applications for study, health and care and skilled worker visas, which make up the majority of legal migration, fell by a quarter — from 184,000 in the first three months of 2023 to 139,100 in the same period this year.The drop has been driven by a sharp fall in the number of student applications. In the first three months of 2024 a total of 40,700 study visa applications were made, a fall of 44% compared to the same period the previous year when there were 72,800.Applications for dependant study visas fell by 80% from 32,900 in the first quarter of 2023 to just 6,700 in the same period in 2024.From Jan 1, 2024 most international students starting courses this year were prevented from bringing family members to Britain.“It is not surprising that there has been a decline in applications,” said Sanam Arora, founder and chair of National Indian Students and Alumni Union UK. “Students have exercised their choice and decided not to study in the UK. Given that higher education is one of our biggest exports, this will be quite a blow to UK universities.”Foreign students can also no longer switch to a work visa before completing their course. The home office has also commissioned the Migration Advisory Committee to carry out a review of the graduate visa, raising fears even this could get restricted, despite the two-year work opportunity being a major draw to Indians.There has been a 28% drop in the total number of applications for health and care visas , falling from 82,900 in the first quarter of 2023 to 59,500 in the same period in 2024.New measures to restrict care workers from bringing dependants came into force on March 11. This does not apply to doctors and nurses.The government has repeatedly said it wants to cut net immigration levels, estimated to be 672,000.Home secretary James Cleverly said: “This does not mark the end of the road in our plan to cut migration, there is more still to come.”This comes as the first failed asylum-seeker was sent to Rwanda on Monday and the home office started rounding up illegal migrants on Wednesday to detain them ahead of sending them there.","UK government's plan to cut legal migration appears to be working, new figures show.

Landmark Google antitrust case ready to conclude,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/landmark-google-antitrust-case-ready-to-conclude/articleshow/109791815.cms,"WASHINGTON: Lawyers for both the Department of Justice and Google will present arguments on Thursday and Friday to conclude the biggest antitrust case in a quarter century. In closing arguments of a Washington , DC, trial that began last September, regulators will apply the finishing touches to a case alleging Google has turned its search engine into an illegal monopoly that stifles competition and innovation.Regulators claim that Google competed unfairly when it made lucrative deals with Apple and other companies to automatically lock its search engine into smartphones and web browsers. Meanwhile, Google maintains that consumers use its dominant search engine because it is the best available option.""Google pays more than USD 10 billion per year for these privileged positions,'' argued Kenneth Dintzer, the Justice Department's lead litigator, last September. ""Google's contracts ensure that rivals cannot match the search quality ad monetisation, especially on phones.""Prabhakar Raghavan, Google's senior vice president for knowledge and information products, said during testimony last October that the company's success is precarious and said its leadership fears their product could slide into irrelevance with younger internet users as technology evolves. He said the company has been tagged with the disparaging moniker ""Grandpa Google"" among younger demographics who don't see it as an interesting product.""Grandpa Google knows the answers and will help you with homework,"" Raghavan said. ""But when it comes to doing interesting things, they like to start elsewhere.""After the closing arguments in the Justice Department's antitrust case against Google wrap up this week, US District Judge Amit Mehta is expected to issue his ruling in the late summer or early autumn. If he decides Google broke the law, another trial will determine how to rein in its market power.The case against Google mirrors the one brought against Microsoft in many ways, including the existential threat it poses to a renowned tech giant whose products are relied on by billions of people.","The case against Google mirrors the one brought against Microsoft in many ways, including the existential threat it poses to a renowned tech giant whose products are relied on by billions of people.

His death follows closely on the heels of another Boeing whistleblower , John Barnett , who reportedly died by suicide two months ago.As per report, Dean's health deteriorated just over two weeks ago, marked by breathing difficulties.Despite aggressive medical intervention, including the use of an ECMO machine, Dean succumbed after a few days of struggle.Dean was among the first to raise alarms about Spirit leadership potentially overlooking critical manufacturing flaws in Boeing's 737 MAX planes. He meticulously documented his findings, including improperly drilled holes in the aft pressure bulkhead, a component crucial for maintaining cabin pressure.In April 2023, Spirit terminated Dean's employment, a move he believed was in retaliation for exposing the plane's flaws.The timing of Dean's demise echoes that of Barnett, who took his own life in March while involved in a lawsuit alleging retaliation for disclosing safety concerns related to the 787 Dreamliner.Former Boeing engineer Sam Salehpour recently testified before lawmakers on Capitol Hill, shedding light on a culture within Boeing that allegedly prioritizes pushing flawed components despite safety risks. Salehpour, with 17 years of Boeing experience, turned whistleblower after facing repercussions for raising safety issues regarding the popular 787 Dreamliner and 777 aircraft.While Boeing acknowledged the presence of imperfections, it emphasized ongoing efforts toward improvement. Boeing contested Salehpour's assertions regarding the Dreamliner's safety, citing extensive testing purportedly demonstrating no signs of fatigue.","Joshua Dean, a former quality auditor at Boeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems, passed away at the age of 45 on Tuesday.

Poll reveals majority of Americans view TikTok as a tool of Chinese influence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/poll-reveals-majority-of-americans-view-tiktok-as-a-tool-of-chinese-influence/articleshow/109782082.cms,"NEW DELHI: A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll has highlighted a growing perception among Americans that TikTok is being used by China to manipulate US public opinion. According to the poll, 58% of respondents believe that the Chinese government uses the popular short-video app to influence American views , while only 13% disagreed with this assertion.Amid these concerns, the US government is moving closer to possibly banning TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance.The debate intensified last week when President Joe Biden signed a law mandating ByteDance to divest TikTok's US operations within 270 days or face a prohibition. This legislation reflects bipartisan apprehension about the app's potential as a vehicle for foreign influence and data security threats.""TikTok has spent more than $1.5 billion on data security efforts and would not share data on its 170 million US users with the Chinese government,"" the company said, denying any promotion or removal of content at Beijing's request. TikTok further declared its intention to challenge any ban as a breach of free speech rights under the US Constitution, noting past legal successes where a judge in Montana blocked a state-level ban on the app citing free speech concerns.Despite TikTok's assurances, the poll indicates that half of the American adults surveyed support a ban, while 32% are opposed, and the remainder are undecided. The support for a ban is stronger among Americans aged 40 and older, with about 60% in favor, compared to roughly 40% of younger adults aged between 18 and 39.Moreover, 46% of respondents also concurred with the view that China uses TikTok for espionage activities on ordinary Americans, a claim repeatedly denied by Beijing.The app's pervasive influence in America is evident, with even Biden's re-election campaign utilizing it as a strategic tool to engage voters for the upcoming presidential election. The issue has created a split among political figures, including former President Donald Trump, who criticized the potential ban despite owning a competing platform, Truth Social.As the January 19 deadline for TikTok’s sale approaches—one day before Biden's term could end—the future of the app in the US remains uncertain, with potential legal and political battles ahead.",A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll has highlighted a growing perception among Americans that TikTok is being used by China to manipulate US public opinion. 58% of respondents believe that the Chinese government uses the popular short-video app to influence American views.

IMF approves last tranche of $3-billion loan to Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imf-approves-last-tranche-of-3-billion-loan-to-pakistan/articleshow/109738150.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif expressed optimism Tuesday regarding release of IMF ’s final $1.1 billion tranche of a $3 billion bailout to the country, saying it would bolster economic stability . Pakistan is now eyeing a new, longer and larger economic bailout package, but economists cautioned against the country’s continued reliance on overseas financial assistance, warning of potential dire consequences.IMF approved the immediate release of the tranche following a key meeting of the global lender’s executive board in Washington late Monday night.All board members favoured releasing the funds, except India, which abstained.Pakistan has been reeling from a severe economic crisis for more than two years, with its inflation at one point shooting up to nearly 38% and its foreign currency reserves depleted to $3bn in Feb 2023, enough to cover less than five weeks of imports.Last year, the global lender had approved a nine-month standby arrangement with Pakistan “to support its economic stabilisation programme”. The approval had allowed for an immediate disbursement of $1.2bn, with the rest phased over the programme’s duration — subject to two quarterly reviews.The IMF bailout proved important to save the country from default, the state broadcaster quoted PM Sharif as saying.Leading economist Qaiser Bengali expressed scepticism about the perceived stability, highlighting the temporary nature of the current situation and underscoring the necessity of meaningful reforms to address long-term economic challenges.“If the so-called stability was due to a rise in exports or better inflow of dollars, that would have been meaningful, but that is not happening,” Bengali said, adding that the economy cannot run on a policy of getting new loans to pay past loans.Pakistan’s external debt obligations exceed $130 billion, with concerns raised by financial experts regarding the potential inflationary impact of the country’s debt-driven approach to fiscal deficit management.","PM Shehbaz Sharif expressed optimism regarding release of IMF ’s final $1.1 billion tranche of a $3 billion bailout to the country.

At the age of 73, Dar, a chartered accountant and experienced politician from the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party, was named deputy prime minister by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday, with the appointment taking immediate effect and until further notice.Shehbaz Sharif and Dar are currently in Saudi Arabia for the World Economic Forum's (WEF) special meeting.According to the Dawn newspaper, Dar's new appointment ""took many by surprise, but drew hardly any criticism from its allies'.Dar being ""awarded' the ""rarely filled' slot of deputy prime minister has raised many questions, the report said.The main talking point is that PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif wants to have his ""confidant' in a key position in the federal cabinet to ""compensate him for the loss of the finance portfolio', it said.The report mentioned that the action was also viewed in connection with Nawaz Sharif assuming leadership of the ruling PML-N party as its president, a position he had been deprived of after being convicted in the Panama Papers case.Dar is seen as having a close relationship with Nawaz Sharif because of the family connection through marriage, as his son is married to the elder Sharif's daughter.An insider claimed that the move to appoint Dar as deputy prime minister was ""pre-planned', the report said. During the formation of the coalition government, it was agreed that Dar would serve as the Deputy Prime Minister.However, based on a report from Geo News, the decision to appoint a four-time finance minister as the foreign minister indicates an increased focus on economics in the country's diplomacy as the financially struggling nation aims to obtain another deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and strengthen external financing from foreign capitals.Dar was the finance minister from 1998 to 1999 and then again from March to May 2008. He once more headed the finance ministry from 2013 to 2017 and later from 2022 to 2023. He additionally worked as the minister for industry and investment from February 1997 to July 1997, and also in commerce from December 1997 to October 1999.According to the report from Dawn, during Nawaz Sharif's tenure as the prime minister, Dar served as the de facto deputy prime minister, leading numerous government and parliamentary committees in the capacity of chairperson. Even though the Constitution does not include a provision for a deputy prime minister, Dar is the second legislator to assume this role.Chaudhry Parvez Elahi served as Deputy Prime Minister when the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) was in power from June 25, 2012, to June 29, 2013. During that period, his responsibilities were largely symbolic, and he was given recognition by then-President Asif Ali Zardari for his support of the government led by the PPP.Elahi is currently serving as the president of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party led by the jailed former prime minister Imran Khan, and he is in prison due to corruption allegations.Interestingly, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), the main ally of the PML-N-led government, did not raise any objection to Dar's new appointment. The PPP Information Secretary, Faisal Karim Kundi, stated that his party had no objections to Dar's appointment as the deputy prime minister. ""It is the PM's prerogative to appoint Dar as deputy prime minister,"" he said, adding that the move was not meant as a ""message' to anyone.Meanwhile, Khan's PTI on Monday reacted strongly to Dar's appointment as the deputy prime minister, saying ""Sharifs are distributing key national posts within the family'.""The Sharif family is distributing important national posts among themselves,"" Special Assistant to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister For Information Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif said.The PTI leader criticized the federal government for appointing individuals to high-ranking positions instead of addressing the problems faced by the people as the Constitution does not provide for the position of deputy PM.Reacting to Dar's appointment, Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (Pildat) President Ahmed Bilal Mehboob termed the PM Shehbaz Sharif-led government's move ""an extra-constitutional step that carries no substantial value'.""This just indicates intra-party tensions and competition for influence. It is not an admirable step because, at this serious juncture of our national life and the lowest point of our economic condition, we should be focusing on substantive issues rather than taking trivial and inconsequential decisions,"" The News reported quoting Mehboob.(With inputs from agencies)","Ishaq Dar, 73, was named deputy prime minister by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday.

Many countries severed ties with Afghanistan after the Taliban returned to power, and no country recognizes them as the legitimate rulers of the country.Afghan embassies either closed or suspended their operations. There's an ongoing power struggle between Afghanistan's embassies and consulates staffed by people from the former Western-backed administration, and those under the Taliban administration's full control.Saeed concedes there are obstacles for Afghan tourism to develop but said he was working with ministries to overcome them.His ultimate aim is to have a visa on arrival for tourists, but that could be years away. There are problems with the road network, which is half-paved or non-existent in some parts of the country, and airlines largely avoid Afghan airspace.The capital Kabul has the most international flights, but no Afghan airport has direct routes with major tourist markets like China, Europe, or India.Despite the challenges, Saeed wants Afghanistan to become a tourism powerhouse, an ambition that appears to be backed by the Taliban's top leaders.""I have been sent to this department on the instructions of the elders (ministers). They must trust me because they've sent me to this important place.""The students also have aspirations. The model, Ahmed Massoud Talash, wants to learn about Afghanistan's picturesque spots for Instagram posts and its history for media appearances.Business school graduate Samir Ahmadzai wants to open a hotel but thinks he should know more about tourism and hospitality first.""They hear that Afghanistan is backwards, poverty and all about war,"" said Ahmadzai. ""We have 5,000 years of history. There should be a new page of Afghanistan.""Classes include Afghan handicrafts and anthropology basics.An unofficial subject is how to interact with foreign women and how their behavior or habits could clash with local customs and edicts. Examples might be women smoking or eating in public, to mixing freely with men who are not related to them by blood or marriage.The Taliban have imposed a dress code for women and requirements for them to have a male guardian, or mahram, when they travel. Dining alone, traveling alone, and socializing with other women in public have become harder. With gyms closed to women and beauty salons banned, there are fewer places where they can meet outside the home.In a sign that the country is preparing for more overseas visitors, the country's only five-star hotel, the Serena, has reopened its women's spa and salon for foreign females after a monthslong closure.Foreigners must show their passport to access services. Women with ""born in Afghanistan"" on their ID are barred.The restrictions on Afghan women and girls weigh on overseas travel companies, who say they try to focus on the positive aspect of cultural interactions by making donations, supporting local projects or only visiting family-run businesses.Shane Horan, the founder of Rocky Road Travel, said visiting Afghanistan should not be seen as an endorsement of any particular government or political regime.""Ultimately, the goal should be to support responsible tourism practices that contribute positively to the local economy and foster mutual respect and understanding, while also remaining cognizant of the broader political context in Afghanistan.""He said there was no input from authorities about what tour groups saw or did, and that the company worked closely with a women's rights organization in Afghanistan. A percentage of the tour cost went into supporting this organization's programs, Horan added.There are no women at the Institute of Tourism & Hotel Management. The students don't mention it. But an official at the Tourism Directorate does.""It's a heartbreaking situation,"" said the official, who wished to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals. ""Even female family members ask if they can study here. But there was a change in policy with the change in government. The women who were studying before (the takeover) never came back. They never graduated.""","Afghanistan's rulers are pariahs on the global stage, largely because of their restrictions on women and girls. The economy is struggling, infrastructure is poor, and poverty is rife. But foreigners are visiting the country, encouraged by the sharp drop in violence.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109714068,imgsize-1602274,width-400,resizemode-4/109714068.jpg"

MANILA: South and Southeast Asia braced for more extreme heat on Sunday as authorities across the region issued health warnings and residents fled to parks and air-conditioned malls for relief.A wave of exceptionally hot weather has blasted the region over the past week, sending the mercury as high as 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) and forcing thousands of schools to tell students to stay home.The Philippines announced on Sunday the suspension of in-person classes at all public schools for two days after a record-shattering day of heat in the capital Manila.In Thailand, where at least 30 people have died of heatstroke so far this year, the meteorological department warned of ""severe conditions"" after temperatures in a northern province exceeded 44.1C (111.4F) on Saturday.And in Cambodia, Myanmar, Vietnam, India and Bangladesh, forecasters warned that temperatures could exceed 40C in the coming days as people endured searing heat and stifling humidity.""I dare not go out in the daytime. I am worried we would get heatstroke,"" said a 39-year-old cashier in Myanmar's Yangon who gave her name as San Yin.She said she has been going to a park with her husband and four-year-old son at night to escape the heat of their fourth-floor apartment.""This is the only spot we can stay to avoid the heat in our neighbourhood,"" she said.Global temperatures hit record highs last year, and the United Nations weather and climate agency said Tuesday that Asia was warming at a particularly rapid pace.Extensive scientific research has found climate change is causing heat waves to become longer, more frequent and more intense.Myanmar has recorded temperatures that are 3-4C higher than the April average, its weather monitor said last week.And on Sunday, the national forecaster predicted temperatures in the central city of Mandalay could rise to 43C.The ministry of water and meteorology in Cambodia warned that temperatures could also hit 43C in some parts of the country in the week ahead, while the health ministry advised people to monitor their health ""during hot weather related to climate change"".Temperatures in Vietnam were also forecast to remain high during a five-day national holiday, with forecasts as high as 41C in the north.Forecasters there said it would remain intensely hot until the end of April, with cooler conditions expected in May.India's weather department said Saturday that severe heatwave conditions would continue through the weekend in several states, with temperatures soaring to 44C in some locations.""I have never experienced this heat before,"" Ananth Nadiger, a 37-year-old advertising professional, told AFP from Bengaluru.""It's very unpleasant and it takes the energy out of you.""The world's biggest democracy is in the middle of a six-week general election that saw millions of voters queue up in searing temperatures on Friday.India's election commission said it had formed a task force to review the impact of heatwaves and humidity before each round of voting.And in Bangladesh, millions of students returned to schools that had been closed due to extreme temperatures, even though its weather bureau said Sunday the heatwave would continue for at least the next three days.""I went to the school with my 13-year-old daughter. She was happy her school was open. But I was tense,"" said Lucky Begum, whose daughter is enrolled at a state-run school in Dhaka.""The heat is too much,"" she told AFP. ""She already got heat rashes from sweating. I hope she does not get sick.""The suspension of in-person classes in the Philippines came after Manila witnessed its highest temperature ever recorded, with jeepney drivers also planning a nationwide strike on Monday and Tuesday.The temperature in the capital hit a record 38.8C (101.8F) on Saturday, with the heat index reaching 45C, data from the state weather forecaster showed.The heat index measures what a temperature feels like, taking into account humidity.Many schools in the Philippines have no air-conditioning, leaving students to swelter in crowded, poorly ventilated classrooms.The hot weather persisted on Sunday, with many flocking to air-conditioned shopping malls and swimming pools for relief.""This is the hottest I've ever experienced here,"" said Nancy Bautista, 65, whose resort in Cavite province near Manila was fully booked.""Many of our guests are friends and families. They swim in the pool to fight the heat.""March, April and May are typically the hottest and driest months of the year in the region but this year's conditions have been exacerbated by the El Nino weather phenomenon.""All places in the country, not necessarily just Metro Manila, are expected to have hotter temperatures until the second week of May,"" Glaiza Escullar of the state weather forecaster told AFP.Camiling municipality in Tarlac province, north of Manila, recorded a temperature of 40.3C (104.5F) on Saturday -- the highest in the Philippines this year.As the mercury rose, Gerise Reyes, 31, planned to take her two-year-old daughter to a shopping mall near Manila.""It's hot here at home.

To address the basic needs of the Afghan population, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has requested a budget of USD 3.6 billion, according to Khaama Press.Last month also, the WFP had raised concerns about a significant increase in malnutrition cases, especially among women and children stating that 1.2 million women were reportedly dealing with malnutrition.According to reports from the World Food Programme, a concerning 1.2 million women are currently facing malnutrition throughout the nation. The organization highlights the worsening malnutrition crisis among children in Afghanistan through a touching video on social media.Earlier this month, the UNHCR has described the situation of human rights, specifically focusing on the rights of women and girls, as well as religious and ethnic minorities in Afghanistan, as very ""grave"" and pushed for immediate requirement for humanitarian assistance for the Afghan people to stay alive.Compounding the humanitarian crisis, reports have emerged of forced deportations of Afghan refugees from neighboring countries, including Pakistan, Iran, and Turkey. Upon their return, these refugees encounter numerous challenges, such as a lack of access to essential resources like clean water, shelter, employment opportunities, and healthcare.The humanitarian situation in Afghanistan has significantly deteriorated since August 2021.Many individuals are worried about the limitations on freedoms and human rights violations, particularly towards women, as the Taliban takes back control.The Taliban's policies, which include forbidding women from entering the workforce and from attending school, have exacerbated the already severe humanitarian situations in the nation. As a result of their exclusion from public life, these women's well-being and the general stability of Afghan society have been greatly affected.The United Nations labelled the country as a ""graveyard of girls' hopes"", as per a TOLOnews report.Another contributing factor the humanitarian problem in Afghanistan is said to be the ineffective strategies of the current government in addressing the well-being of the Afghan population.(With inputs from agencies)","The World Food Programme has been providing food and cash assistance to six million people in Afghanistan every month.

NEW DELHI: UK's Prince William and his wife Kate Middleton on Thursday released a photo of their daughter Charlotte to celebrate her ninth birthday .The photograph, taken in the last few days by her mother, the Princess of Wales, shows Charlotte, the couple's second child, smiling happily in the garden of their home in Windsor.In a post on X, the couple said, ""Happy 9th Birthday, Princess Charlotte ! Thank you for all of the kind messages today.""Kensington Palace has established a tradition of releasing photographs taken by Kate to commemorate birthdays and other family events.However, a picture issued earlier this year on Mother's Day in March was retracted by several news organisations due to editing, something for which Kate later apologised.This incident happened shortly before the princess disclosed that she was undergoing preventive chemotherapy after tests following major abdominal surgery in January that revealed the presence of cancer.The heir to the throne, William, resumed official duties last month, but Kate will only return to the public eye when her medical team confirms she is well enough. King Charles returned to public engagements this week for the first time since being diagnosed with cancer in February.Last month, the couple also released a photograph of their youngest child, Prince Louis, to mark his sixth birthday. The image taken by Kate, showed Louis lying on his stomach on the grass in a close-up shot.","UK's Prince William and his wife Kate Middleton released a photo of their daughter Charlotte to celebrate her ninth birthday.

Birmingham faces economic collapse amid record bankruptcy filings,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/birmingham-faces-economic-collapse-amid-record-bankruptcy-filings/articleshow/109781245.cms,"NEW DELHI: The city of Birmingham , once heralded as a beacon of municipal excellence, now grapples with severe financial distress , leading to drastic public service cuts and asset sales. This crisis emerged after the city declared bankruptcy last September due to its inability to balance its budget, resulting in a ""section 114"" notice, which is effectively a declaration of bankruptcy for local governments.Historically celebrated for its governance, Birmingham's current predicament is a stark contrast to its past.In 1890, Julian Ralph, an American journalist, extolled Birmingham as “the best-governed city in the world.” Yet today, the city council plans to close 25 libraries, end free swimming pool access, and has even considered selling its art galleries to mitigate financial strains. The once frequent waste collection will now occur fortnightly, and streetlights have been dimmed to cut costs, a CNN report said.The city's financial woes are compounded by historical mismanagement, including a failure to ensure equal pay across genders, resulting in significant compensation costs. Additionally, an IT system debacle has contributed to a financial deficit amounting to roughly £1 billion ($1.25 billion). Funding cuts from the central government, amounting to another £1 billion over the last decade, have further strained the city's finances, exacerbating the demand for services amidst shrinking budgets.Local historian Carl Chinn described the situation as a failure of the city to prioritize essential services, likening the city’s austerity measures to ""iron bars slammed shut on all our imaginings."" The city’s response includes selling over £1 billion in assets and a 21% hike in council tax, with the intent to generate £300 million in savings over two years. However, these measures have sparked significant local opposition.Kate Taylor, a local schoolteacher and leader of the ""Brum, Rise Up!"" campaign, expressed the community's frustration, stating, ""These cuts are not just going to be hard, they’re going to devastate the city.” Her campaign group, consisting of youth and social workers, musicians, and trade unionists, reflects a broad swath of community members impacted by the budgetary decisions, the CNN report said.The dire financial circumstances have also led to protests at the Birmingham and Midland Institute, where residents gathered to voice their concerns over the deep cuts to public services. Speaker after speaker detailed how the cuts would strip the city of its cultural and social fabric, impacting everything from mental health services for youth to access to cultural spaces.As England faces a wave of local government financial crises, Birmingham’s situation may be a harbinger of a larger national catastrophe. The upcoming local elections may reflect the public's response to these challenges, with potential implications for the ruling Conservative Party.","The city of Birmingham, once heralded as a beacon of municipal excellence, now grapples with severe financial distress.
