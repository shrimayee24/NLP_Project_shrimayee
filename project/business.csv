NEW DELHI: Reminiscing 'Sholay' in times of conflict, the Consulate General of Iran in Mumbai Tuesday took to X (formerly Twitter) to post about an Iranian newspaper's coverage on the iconic Bollywood film awaiting its 50th anniversary.The Iranian embassy joined in, posting ""Sholay turns 50 and Iran still remembers."" While this nostalgic tribute highlighted the film's timeless appeal and cross-cultural resonance transcending borders, the gesture was also pleasantly surprising at a time when the country is recovering from a war.'Sholay' was released on Aug 15, 1975, when India was under the Emergency.The Consulate General's post recalled how an Iranian newspaper dedicated a full-page tribute to 'Sholay', noting that the film's unforgettable story of friendship has become a cornerstone of cinematic memory in Iran. Interestingly, the iconic villain Gabbar Singh is known as Jabbar Singh in Iran. The post also mentioned Iranian actor Navid Mamza, who drew inspiration from Gabbar Singh's looks and menacing mannerisms.This gesture is significant given the historical and cultural ties between India and Iran. The two countries enjoyed a long-standing relationship rooted in their shared border until India's partition in 1947.Indian cinema has been a common thread between the two nations, with films like 'Shree 420' and 'Sangam' gaining immense popularity in Iran.

I can’t accept payment by UPI anymore,” Shankar, a shopkeeper in Horamavu told ET.According to vendors, lawyers and accountants, thousands of unregistered small businesses, including street food stalls, push carts and corner shops, have received GST notices. Some face demands running into lakhs of rupees.Advocate Vinay K Sreenivasa, joint secretary of the Federation of Bengaluru Street Vendors Associations, said many vendors fear harassment by GST officers and possible eviction by civic authorities, prompting them to switch to cash.Under the current GST framework, businesses supplying goods must register and pay GST if their annual turnover exceeds Rs 40 lakh. For service providers, the threshold is Rs 20 lakh.The commercial taxes department stated that notices were issued only in cases where UPI transaction data since 2021-22 indicated turnover levels that require GST registration. It said such businesses must register, disclose their taxable turnover, and pay the applicable tax.However, HD Arun Kumar, former additional commissioner of commercial taxes in Karnataka, said GST authorities cannot simply quote random figures as turnover. “Under the GST laws, the burden of proof is on officers. They must establish it before arriving at a tax demand, unlike in money laundering cases,” he said.Opposition BJP MLA S Suresh Kumar said he plans to write to Chief Minister Siddaramaiah seeking his intervention.A former GST field official pointed out that not all UPI credits reflect business income. “Some of it would be informal loans or transfers from family and friends,” he said.“Bengaluru may emerge as a test case. If the GST authorities can net a good chunk of revenue by tapping unregistered vendors, other states too will take the cue as every state is desperate for funds,” said chartered accountant Sreenivasan Ramakrishnan of Sreeni & Associates.“Officials have zeroed in on chat vendors with high business in Mumbai. It's only a matter of time considering the huge potential tax base,” he told ET.Karnataka’s tax officials are under pressure to meet a collection target of Rs 1.20 lakh crore for 2025-26.

NEW DELHI: The income tax department Monday launched a nationwide verification operation targeting individuals and entities facilitating fraudulent claims of deductions and exemptions in I-T returns.The exercise is not limited to deductions for donations to little-known political parties and charities but also those related to health insurance and medical expenses (Sec 80D and 80DDB of I-T Act), HRA (Sec 10(13A), interest on education and home loans and for purchase of vehicles (Sec 80E, 80EE and 80EEB), CBDT said.Those under lens are MNC staff, public sector companies, government bodies, academic institutions and entrepreneurs who have claimed deductions without valid justification, it said.The I-T department is now poised to take stern action against continued fraudulent claims, including penalties and prosecution wherever applicable. The ongoing verification exercise across 150 premises is expected to yield crucial evidence, including digital records, that will aid in dismantling networks behind these schemes and ensure accountability,"" the I-T dept said.This action follows a detailed analysis of ""misuse of tax benefits under I-T Act, 1961, often in collusion with professional intermediaries"", it said. It said that investigations have uncovered ""organised rackets"" operated by certain ITR preparers and intermediaries, who have been filing returns claiming fictitious deductions and exemptions. The move is a signal to individuals who take shortcuts and make claims without having evidence of deductions or expenses shown in returns.Tax authorities tapped multiple databases to identify likely offenders. It conducted search and seizures in several states, including Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Gujarat, Punjab, and MP, where it found evidence of fraudulent claims.CBDT said the actions follow an outreach conducted programme, asking taxpayers to revise their returns in case discrepancies were noticed. ""As a result, around 40,000 taxpayers have updated their returns in last four months, voluntarily withdrawing false claims amounting to Rs 1,045 crore.

NEW DELHI: The US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) has busted an ISI-China-Canada linked international drug cartel and arrested a notorious Indo-Canadian gangster, Opinder Singh Sian aka Thanos, running a global fentanyl and methamphetamine trafficking ring from British Columbia.According to court documents reviewed by TOI, Sian was arrested in Arizona on June 27 after his role in smuggling methamphetamine to Australia and chemicals for fentanyl into the US via Canada was established.The investigation, which kicked off in 2022, and a recently unsealed affidavit in a US court, has revealed that Sian, had operational ties with chemical suppliers linked to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) besides the Sinaloa cartel in Mexico.The DEA had mounted an undercover operation to trap Sian after his dubious ties came to fore in 2021-2022 in the aftermath of a preliminary inquiry conducted regarding a tip from a Turkish intelligence agency.Singh was at the time a known senior member of the notorious ISI-backed 'Brothers Keepers' gang which mostly has foot soldiers from Punjab in India, many of whom are Canadian citizens.The gang, which has lent its support to the cause of so-called Khalistan on many occasions, was also seen active in commemorations rallies in support of Air India bombing mastermind Talwinder Singh Parmar and others, sources said.According to Canadian police, the group deals in bulk trafficking of cocaine, MDMA, heroin, fentanyl and methamphetamine besides arms trafficking, murder, extortion and armed robbery.In his early days, Sian was wounded in a shooting in Aug 2008 that left his friend Gurpreet Sidhu dead and survived another bid on his life in May 2011, marking his rapid rise in Canada's underworld.

'Committed To Peace': Pak Calls for Dialogue With India at SCO After Pahalgam Attack, Op Sindoor

NEW DELHI: Stressing on acquiring the most advanced but indigenous defence technologies to have an upper hand over adversaries, chief of defence staff general Anil Chauhan said that “in today’s warfare, you cannot win with yesterday’s weapon systems”. “Today's warfare has to be fought with tomorrow’s technology,” he said.The CDS advocated for accelerated development of homegrown drone technology and counter-UAS grids, cautioning that outdated technology cannot be relied upon in modern battlefields.In his address at an event held at the Manekshaw Centre in Delhi, CDS Chauhan also pointed out that during Operation Sindoor, Pakistan had used unarmed drones and loiter munitions on May 10 but “none of them could actually inflict any damage to Indian military or civilian infrastructure, and most of them were neutralised through a combination of kinetic and non-kinetic means”.Laying stress on self-reliance in drone and UAV technology, he said, “Our 'Operation Sindoor' has shown us why we must not depend on imported drone or counter-drone technology. Indigenous systems are critical. Foreign systems come with limitations — their specifications are widely known, allowing adversaries to anticipate tactics.”Gen Chauhan said recent conflicts globally have demonstrated how drones can “shift tactical balance disproportionately”.Asserting that self-reliance in UAVs and Counter-Unmanned Aerial Systems (C-UAS) is a “strategic imperative” for India, he said Operation Sindoor has shown why indigenously developed Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and C-UAS “built for our terrain and our needs are crucial”. “Asymmetric drone warfare is making large platforms vulnerable and driving militaries to rethink the conceptual aspects of air doctrines, development of C-UAS and adaptive moves of engagement,” he said.“In the history of warfare, we have witnessed revolutionary changes — from heavy rifles to lighter, more sophisticated long-range weapons. But the biggest shift is the emergence of drones and unarmed aerial systems. Their utility has grown multifold — from basic surveillance tools to becoming effective force multipliers on the battlefield,” Gen Chauhan said.He explained that drones, despite being smaller and less aerodynamic, are reshaping conventional warfare. “They are cheaper, harder to detect and yet sophisticated. This defies traditional military thinking,” he said. Operation Sindoor, he said, clearly demonstrated the need to secure lower airspace and develop integrated counter-UAV systems.His statement comes amid a global shift towards drone-dominated conflicts, like in the case of the Israel-Iran conflict and the Russia-Ukraine war, where hundreds of drones are being used for bombing strategic targets, individuals and even key installations.","Chief of defence staff general Anil Chauhan said that “in today’s warfare, you cannot win with yesterday's weapon systems” He advocated for accelerated development of homegrown drone technology and counter-UAS grids, cautioning that outdated technology cannot be relied upon in modern battlefields.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122592319,imgsize-1335439,width-400,resizemode-4/122592319.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Congress is likely to settle for a lower share of seats in Bihar than it contested in 2020, with sources saying that negotiations are on with a constituency-wise analysis among partners, including RJD and Left parties.According to a Congress manager, the party is likely to get a tally between 50 and 60 seats to contest, which would be below the 70 seats it contested in the last election to the 243-member assembly. But Congress, sources said, is focusing more on the ""winnability"" factor than numbers, and is keen to ensure that the alliance does not face dissonance which a race among allies for a greater share creates.While talks are ongoing, Congress's willingness to settle for a lower tally appears to be a bitter lesson learnt from the humbling experience of 2020. Congress had secured a high tally of 70 seats after intense bargaining, but could win only 19, and ended up taking the blame for the RJD-led alliance falling just short of the magic number against the JDU-BJP combination, which scraped home.Other parties in the alliance were CPM, CPI, CPI (ML), which had performed much better than Congress, compounding the criticism directed at the grand old party. The Patna failure seriously curbed Congress's bargaining power in the elections that followed in Tamil Nadu and other states where the party was a junior member of the alliance.While the better-than-expected results in the 2024 parliamentary polls raised Congress stock, the Haryana and Maharashtra debacles have marked a setback to the party in the eyes of its allies. At the same time, sources said Congress too is aware of the need for unity among partners and does not want to come across as putting itself above the alliance's interests.In Bihar, according to Congress members, the party is working to ensure coherence in the alliance and seeking to add value to the grand anti-NDA combine by amplifying Rahul Gandhi's messaging among backward classes.

NEW DELHI: Those with pending toll dues for use of National Highways (NHs) will soon not be able to get a no-objection certificate (NOC) for renewal of registration and insurance, change of ownership, transfer and issuance of fitness certificate. The road transport ministry has issued a draft notification to introduce this change in Motor Vehicle Rules, to boost digital collection of toll fees and ensure that no one gets a free ride on tolled highways.The move gains further importance in light of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) going for multi lane free flow (MLFF) on NH stretches for tolling purposes, with there being no physical barrier to stop vehicles for collection of user fee.The draft notification proposes that the registration authorities “shall not grant request” for depositing motor vehicle tax or recording transfer of ownership in certificate of registration if “unpaid user fee” is reflected against the vehicle in question. The proposed change in rules also says that in case a vehicle crosses a tolling point after being electronically recorded but the toll charge is not paid, either because of the vehicle not having an affixed valid FASTag or on account of a pending challan, it will be reflected as unpaid user fee in the system.Officials said that vehicle owners would be allowed to avail the vehicle- and transport-related services only after they clear the toll dues.Earlier, NHAI had urged the road transport ministry to make changes in the Vahan system, which is the repository for all registered vehicles, to recover unpaid toll from vehicles with no FASTag or faulty/blacklisted tags.",The road transport ministry has issued a draft notification to introduce this change in Motor Vehicle Rules.

NEW DELHI: In the politically significant AgustaWestland VVIP chopper scam case, Delhi HC on Wednesday rejected a plea from fugitive Shravan Gupta, promoter of Emaar-MGF who fled to London in 2019, seeking further adjournment of his case relating to non-bailable warrant against him and that he be allowed to appear before ED through video conferencing in view of his inability to return to India.Pulling up his counsel for misleading the court repeatedly, the court refused to grant any further adjournment while reserving its order on the plea of quashing the non-bailable warrant.ED argued before Justice Neena Bansal that Gupta had failed to appear for questioning despite nine summonses issued to him since 2019. Two days after he wrote to ED (on Nov 24, 2019) seeking ""some time to join the investigation"" on grounds of ill health, with a doctor's prescription advising six days rest to him, Gupta had fled to London and not returned since then, sources said.Rejecting Gupta's adjournment request, Justice Bansal said the matter had already been argued by both sides on two previous occasions, and on each date after the arguments, senior counsel (for Gupta) Vikas Pahwa had sought time to get instructions from his client regarding his return to India to join the investigation. Such conduct is ""unbecoming of a senior advocate"", the judge said while pointing out that the counsel had been seeking repeated adjournments.Gupta is accused of receiving kickbacks from AgustaWestland intermediaries for influencing the VVIP chopper deal worth Rs 3,600 crore, sealed during the UPA regime. ""Shravan Gupta received proceeds of crime in Natille Overseas Inc, Switzerland; Timekeeper Ltd, British Virgin Islands; Hall Park Holdings Ltd, UK, etc which are beneficially owned by him,"" the ED had said earlier, and has filed 12 chargesheets in the case, including against Gupta in 2022.Probe found that a Mauritius-based shell firm received bribes in the deal signed with Agusta SPA, Italy. Bribes were laundered to India allegedly through Gupta's shell entities and shared with IAF officials, bureaucrats and politically exposed persons through a complex web of transactions.","Gupta is accused of receiving kickbacks from AgustaWestland intermediaries for influencing the VVIP chopper deal worth Rs 3,600 crore, sealed during the UPA regime.

HYDERABAD: The latest instance of toddy adulteration in Telangana, which has left seven people dead and dozens in hospital, has exposed another dark and sinister side of the business driving the sale of this alcoholic beverage that is otherwise considered less potent.Doctors report that an increasing number of children are getting addicted to toddy that has been spiked with sedatives like alprazolam (Xanax), diazepam (Valium) and chlordiazepoxide (Librium). Some of these children are as young as two years old and have barely learnt to stand on their feet. They are brought to doctors with withdrawal symptoms such as seizures, fever and sleeplessness.Psychiatrists TOI spoke to said it is common practice in parts of rural Telangana for parents and grandparents to give their children toddy to calm them and put them to sleep. What the elders don't realise is that much of the toddy sold now is often laced with sedatives. Doctors say they are seeing a substantial increase in such cases since pandemic, with four to five cases being reported every month.""In rural Telangana, it's very common for the whole family, including children, to consume toddy as it is considered a traditional drink. In poor families, children are made to consume it so that they sleep when both parents are out working. So, by the time a child is seven or eight, he or she is addicted to adulterated toddy, causing irreparable damage to their young bodies,"" said Dr Srinivas SRRY, head of the psychiatry department and nodal officer, addiction treatment facility, Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Hospital, Warangal. He has treated several children under 10 with withdrawal symptoms.","Doctors report that an increasing number of children are getting addicted to toddy that has been spiked with sedatives.

KANPUR: In a remarkable scientific breakthrough that may rewrite regional history, a team from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur has discovered signs of ancient Buddhist stupas and structural remains buried beneath the soil in Yamuna Nagar district of Haryana.Using advanced Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) technology, researchers detected circular structures, old walls, and chamber-like rooms at a depth of around 6 to 7 feet, pointing to the possibility of a 2,000-year-old Buddhist site.The survey, commissioned by the Haryana State Department of Archaeology, was part of a broader investigation to locate potential historical structures across several sites, including Topra Kalan and other villages known for scattered old bricks on the surface.The IIT Kanpur team's work offers compelling evidence of buried heritage that may date back to the Buddhist period or even to the Mahabharata era, according to local tradition.Professor Javed Malik of IIT Kanpur's Civil Engineering Department said, ""When we surveyed the mound's exterior, we picked up strong geo-radar reflections indicating a semi-circular structure beneath.

NEW DELHI: It is a classic case of how courts should not decide the custody battle of a child between estranged parents, by only hearing arguments of the warring couple's lawyers in the courtroom without interacting with the minor to know about the child's liking and comfort level with parents.Ten months after it directed a woman to hand over custody of a 12-year-old boy to her divorced husband, the Supreme Court has recalled its order as it resulted in mental and emotional breakdown of the minor who did not want to get separated from his mother and is now undergoing psychiatric treatment at Christian Medical College, Vellore.Admitting the error by the apex court as well as Kerala high court in granting custody to the father who visited and met the child only a few times in 12 years, a bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Prasanna B Varale said that the judicial order had a ""calamitous effect"" on the child's health and reversed its order by granting custody to the mother.In this case, the couple got divorced within two years of marriage in 2011 and the child had been living with the mother since then. She remarried four years after divorce. The father in 2022 approached a family court for custody of the child on the ground that the woman was shifting to Malaysia along with her second husband. The family court rejected the plea but Kerala HC and SC in Aug last year allowed his plea.The court's order led to deterioration of the child's mental health and the clinical psychologist's report said the minor was suffering anxiety and fear, with a high risk of separation anxiety disorder.The mother thereafter filed a review petition for recall of the order and placed medical reports before the court.Allowing her plea, the court said, ""It would be extremely harsh and insensitive for courts of law to expect the child to accept and flourish in an alien household where his own biological father is akin to a stranger to him. We cannot turn a blind eye to the trauma that is being inflicted on the child in consequence of the orders of courts of law handing custody to the father, who is alleged to exhibit apathy towards the tender emotional state of the minor.

New IT bill removes redundant provisions

NEW DELHI: There should be a time-bound resolution of litigations, a parliamentary panel that examined the Income Tax Bill, 2025, has suggested, as it made 285 recommendations on the draft legislation aimed at simplifying and modernising tax laws.The select committee of Lok Sabha headed by BJP's Baijayant Panda examined the IT Bill and adopted the report on the draft legislation, which is expected to be presented in the House on Monday (July 21) - the first day of Parliament's monsoon session. ""We have made 285 recommendations. The government has already accepted 250. We have said tax litigations should not linger on and there should be time-bound resolution, although huge improvements have happened as can be seen in the case of refunds,"" a panel member said.The recommendations of the parliamentary panel that examined the Income Tax Bill, 2025, were largely ""corrective"" in nature, a panel member told TOI. The simplification efforts have led to the reduction of the size of the document to 600 pages from the earlier 850. The IT Bill, 2025, was tabled in Parliament on February 13 and was aimed at simplifying the language and structure of the IT Act 1961.It was sent to the select committee for examination.The simplification exercise was guided by three core principles, which included textual and structural simplification for improved clarity and coherence, no major tax policy changes to ensure continuity and certainty, and no modification of tax rates, which is aimed at preserving predictability for taxpayers, an official statement had said.The new IT Bill also aims at eliminating redundant and repetitive provisions for better navigation, reorganising sections logically to facilitate case of reference. It has opted for simplified language to make the law more accessible and has removed obsolete and redundant provisions for greater clarity.Existing taxation principles have been preserved to ensure continuity while enhancing usability, the statement had said. ""The Income-Tax Bill, 2025, reflects the govt's commitment to enhancing ease of doing business by providing a tax framework that is simplified and clear,"" it had said.In an interview to TOI a day after presenting her 8th consecutive Budget in February this year, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said that the new IT bill was aimed at making it relevant for the 21st century.CBDT chairman Ravi Agrawal had said there has been simplification in terms of the language and presentation and it brings more clarity to the system which is expected to reduce litigation.","The select committee of Lok Sabha examined the IT Bill and adopted the report on the draft legislation.

NEW DELHI: With around 35.7 lakh electors, comprising 4.5 per cent of Bihar's total 7.9 crore electorate, not found at their recorded address despite the booth level officers (BLOs) having completed their three mandatory visits, the EC will, starting Thursday, share their details with district presidents and 1.5 lakh booth level agents of the political parties, so that they can confirm the exact status of such electors by July 25.EC, in a statement issued Wednesday, said just a little over 6.8 per cent of remaining electors across Bihar now need to submit their enumeration forms. It shared that the enumeration forms of Bihar's 88.7 per cent electorate have been received and 82 per cent uploaded on ECINet. Accounting for the 4.5 per cent electors not found at their address, of which 1.6 per cent are probably deceased, 2.2 per cent probably permanently shifted and 0.7 per cent identified as enrolled as multiple places, around 93.2 per cent of Bihar's 7.9 crore electors have already been covered under SIR.Welcoming the people's response to the SIR exercise, chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar said: ""I thank all eligible electors of Bihar for actively participating in the much-needed cleaning of electoral rolls"".The last date for electors to submit their filled-out enumeration forms is July 25. All electors who turn in their forms, with or without complete documentation, will be included in the Bihar draft electoral roll to be published on Aug 1, 2025.The documents can be added during the claims and objection period.Sharing exact progress of SIR so far, EC Wednesday said around 7 crore electors have submitted their enumeration forms, with 6.5 crore forms uploaded on ECINet app/portal. However, nearly 35.7 lakh electors were not found at the addresses recorded against their name in the electoral roll; these include 12.5 lakh electors who are probably deceased, 17.4 lakh probably permanently shifted; and neary 5.8 lakh electors enrolled at multiple places.As of 6 pm Wednesday, enumeration forms of 54.1 lakh electors were remaining to be received. EC has appealed to people who have temporarily migrated outside Bihar to fill their enumeration forms online, either using the ECINet app on their mobiles or via the voters' portal. ""They may also download the pre-filled enumeration form and share the filled forms with BLOs directly or through family via WhatsApp or any medium,"" it added.To ensure that eligible electors are not left out, special camps are being set up in 5,683 wards of the state's 261 urban local bodies.","4.5 per cent of Bihar's total 7.9 crore electorate not found at their recorded address.

Compelling dead marriage to go on perpetuates mental agony: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/compelling-dead-marriage-to-go-on-perpetuates-mental-agony-supreme-court/articleshow/122594487.cms,"Supreme Court

Welfare and dignity of both spouses must be prioritised, says apex court

NEW DELHI: Observing that compelling dead marriage to continue only creates more mental agony, Supreme Court has said that courts should grant divorce in such cases when a couple cannot live under one roof.Bringing to an end the matrimonial dispute which has been going on for the last 16 years, a bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta allowed the plea of the husband for divorce despite the wife opposing it. The court noted that the couple has been living separately just a year after marriage and even the mediation process failed to sort out their differences. The court invoked its special power under Article 142 to do complete justice.""It has been consistently held by this court that the institution of marriage is rooted in dignity, mutual respect and shared companionship, and when these foundational aspects are irreparably lost, forcing a couple to remain legally bound serves no beneficial purpose,"" the court said.Supreme Court said, “It has been emphasised by this court in Amutha v Subramaniam that the welfare and dignity of both the spouses must be prioritised, and that compelling a dead marriage to continue only perpetuates mental agony and societal burden.”In this case, the couple got married in 2008 according to the Hindu rites and ceremonies but the difference cropped up between them. They started living separately from Oct 2009 onwards and the husband filed divorce petition before a family court a year after. The family court turned down his plea in 2017 and the Delhi high court also refused to grant divorce in 2019 on the ground of cruelty as alleged by him. In the meanwhile, the wife also filed a harassment case against in-laws for it was also rejected.Noting that the parties have been living separately for more than 16 years and there has been a complete cessation of cohabitation and consortium, rendering the marriage defunct for all practical and legal purposes, the apex court allowed the divorce plea of husband.“In the present case, it is apparent that due to complete detachment and the prolonged estrangement, there has been an irretrievable breakdown of the marital bond, which cannot be mended by any means. Moreover, both the parties have spent the prime years of their youth entangled in this marital discord, which has persisted for more than the last 15 years,” it said.“It is as clear as a day in the case at hand, the continuance of marriage shall only fuel animosity and litigation between the parties, which runs contrary to the ethos of matrimonial harmony envisioned by the law. This would ring true even more in the light of appellant’s (husband) and his family members’ acquittal in the cruelty case preferred by the respondent. It cannot be expected by the appellant to now continue in a marital bond with the respondent, a partner who had filed and fought a false case against her husband and in-laws,” it said.",Supreme Court says courts should grant divorce in such cases when a couple cannot live under one roof. Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta allowed the plea of the husband for divorce.

Samantha Ponder Breaks Her Silence Since ESPN Firing (FIRST Interview) | The Sage Steele Show

More than a year after her unexpected exit from ESPN, former NFL Countdown host Sam Ponder is finally sharing the behind-the-scenes truth—and it’s nothing like the “budget cuts” explanation viewers were fed in 2023. In a candid appearance on The Sage Steele Show, Ponder claimed that her support for female athletes and her cautious views on transgender participation in women’s sports led to internal pushback, quiet censorship, and ultimately, her departure.The tipping point came in July 2023, when Ponder retweeted a video of Paula Scanlan—a former teammate of transgender swimmer Lia Thomas—sharing her experience at UPenn. Ponder’s comment was mild: she simply encouraged followers to “listen.” But that act alone sparked a warning from a higher-up at ESPN. She recalled receiving a private email urging her not to “misgender people,” which she interpreted as a veiled threat. “I knew I was on the clock,” Ponder admitted.The network reportedly flagged more of her online activity, including a “liked” tweet from Megyn Kelly joking that “men don’t need gynecologists.”Ponder didn’t think it was controversial. “It was just a favorite,” she said. “I didn’t think that was a big deal.”While ESPN cited cost-cutting as the official reason behind her departure—lumping her in with figures like Robert Griffin III—Ponder believes her limited role on Sunday NFL Countdown wasn’t actually draining company resources. Instead, she feels her open support for female athletes like Riley Gaines made her an internal liability.She even mentioned avoiding coverage of Gaines during Women's History Month out of fear of backlash. “I knew I was supposed to talk about Riley,” Ponder confessed. “But I didn’t.”Despite the fallout, Ponder doesn’t feel bitter. She called her firing “one of the best things that’s ever happened” to her, saying, “I was on the hamster wheel. I wasn’t going to jump off on my own.” Her final message was clear: “I wasn’t trying to be controversial. I just wanted people to hear stories I wasn’t seeing on SportsCenter.”Also Read: Joy Taylor’s FOX Sports scandal: Everything about the backstage drama, show cancellations, and lawsuit that led to her exit With the debate around inclusion in women’s sports only growing louder, Ponder’s revelations have reignited a culture war ESPN may not be able to sidestep much longer.","Former NFL Countdown host Sam Ponder was fired by ESPN in 2023.

Flight Schedule and Details

Doha to Aleppo (QR414): Departs 08:30, arrives 11:40

Aleppo to Doha (QR415): Departs 13:55, arrives 17:00

Why This Matters

Rebuilding Ties With Syria: The return to Aleppo follows the earlier restart of flights to Damascus. Together, these routes point to Qatar Airways’ slow but steady return to the Syrian market. The country had been cut off from much international air travel due to years of conflict. These flights mark a shift. Expanding Regional Access: Aleppo joins Qatar Airways’ network of over 170 destinations. For travelers, this means more access in and out of northern Syria. For the airline, it’s a step in reconnecting the region to its global routes. Connecting Through Doha: All flights route through Hamad International Airport in Doha, a growing hub for travel between Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. For Syrians flying out of Aleppo, this opens the door to global destinations, many of which are not directly accessible otherwise.

A recent study published in Nature Medicine by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a specialised agency of the World Health Organization (WHO), has issued a stark warning: the world is facing a significant surge in gastric cancer cases, with Asia—and particularly India—bearing the brunt. The study analysed people born between 2008 and 2017 and estimated that 15.6 million individuals globally from this generation are at risk of developing gastric cancer in their lifetime. Worryingly, almost two-thirds of these cases will occur in Asia, largely due to high population numbers and ongoing exposure to risk factors.The study highlights that India and China together could account for approximately 6.5 million new gastric cancer cases in the coming decades. This projection positions Asia as the global hotspot for the disease. The rise is largely driven by factors such as rapid population growth, increasing life expectancy, and a continued prevalence of key risk factors—many of which are still not adequately addressed through public health measures. These include poor sanitation, limited access to healthcare, and dietary habits that may increase stomach cancer risk.Experts say this could make gastric cancer one of India’s biggest future health crises if timely action is not taken.One of the most important takeaways from the study is that Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is the leading cause of future gastric cancer cases—accounting for about 76% of them. This bacterium infects the lining of the stomach and can remain undetected for years. Over time, it causes inflammation that can lead to ulcers and eventually cancer. In India, where access to preventive screening is limited and awareness is low, H. pylori often goes untreated, significantly raising the risk of long-term health complications. The study urges stronger surveillance and early intervention programmes to tackle this hidden epidemic.Currently, gastric cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide, but its burden is not evenly distributed. While some regions, like Sub-Saharan Africa, report relatively low incidence rates today, the study warns of a six-fold increase in cases in those areas over time. In contrast, India’s numbers are expected to rise more sharply and sooner due to existing health inequalities, limited diagnostic infrastructure, and lack of widespread awareness about early symptoms. This puts millions of Indians at a heightened and preventable risk.The research points to a clear solution: early screening and treatment of H. pylori can dramatically reduce future cases of gastric cancer—by as much as 75%. In countries like India, where healthcare resources may be stretched, focusing on population-wide, low-cost screening initiatives could be a game-changer. Treating H. pylori with antibiotics and simple follow-up care could save countless lives and significantly ease the burden on the healthcare system. These preventive steps are not only scientifically sound but also financially viable.Perhaps the most alarming finding from the study is that gastric cancer is increasingly affecting younger individuals, especially those born after 2008. This is a major shift from previous decades when the disease primarily affected older adults.Combined with India’s ageing population, this trend could create a dual burden of both young and elderly patients requiring long-term cancer care. Without timely intervention, India risks reversing years of public health progress in cancer control.India must take public health action against gastric cancerTo reduce its future gastric cancer burden, India needs to adopt a multi-pronged public health strategy. The study recommends:These actions are essential not only to control gastric cancer rates but also to build long-term resilience in India’s public health system.With projections estimating over 1.6 million new gastric cancer cases in India alone, the country is at a crossroads. The study’s findings are a powerful reminder that prevention is not just possible—it is necessary. Investing in screening, early detection, and health education can prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths and reduce the financial and emotional toll on families. If India acts now, it can turn the tide and prevent gastric cancer from becoming an unstoppable epidemic in the decades to come.",Gastric cancer is rising in India faster than in many regions.

Goldman Sachs to the halls of power: Rishi Sunak’s journey from finance to political leadership



Leading the UK through crisis

A return to finance, but with a new mission

The full circle of a modern career





Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak ’s latest career move surprised many. After serving as the United Kingdom’s Prime Minister during one of its most turbulent periods, he is now returning to Goldman Sachs as a senior adviser. This is the very firm where his professional journey in finance began more than two decades ago.“Right now, our country is facing a profound economic crisis. The aftermath of COVID still lingers. Putin’s war in Ukraine has destabilized energy markets and supply chains over the world.”I pledge to govern with integrity, professionalism, and accountability, and promise, “Trust is earned, and I will earn yours.”Said Rishi Sunak, as he took oath as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom on 25 October 2022, under looming clouds of uncertainty, and water as well, outside 10 Downing Street, London.Now, two and a half years later, Rishi Sunak prepares to return to the private sector as a senior adviser at Goldman Sachs, the very firm where his journey in finance began.From a young investment banker at Goldman, to leading the UK through political and economic turbulence, and now rejoining the financial world, Sunak’s path has come full circle, blending boardrooms, ballots, and comeback at Goldman Sachs.Rishi Sunak’s early career was rooted firmly in finance.After graduating from Oxford and Stanford, he joined Goldman Sachs as a summer intern and then worked as an analyst from 2001 to 2004. This experience gave him a foundation in global markets and investment banking, skills that would later shape his approach to economic policy. However, Sunak’s ambitions extended beyond finance. He entered politics, winning the Richmond parliamentary seat in 2015. His rise was rapid, culminating in his appointment as Chancellor of the Exchequer, where he managed the UK’s economic response to the COVID-19 crisis. His leadership during this period was widely noted for balancing fiscal support with a commitment to economic stability.Now, as he re-enters the private sector, many will watch to see how Sunak’s unique blend of political insight and financial expertise influences Goldman Sachs’ global strategy. His move also raises broader questions about the crossover between public leadership and corporate influence in a post-pandemic world.Rishi Sunak became Prime Minister in October 2022 following the resignation of Liz Truss, whose short-lived premiership collapsed under the weight of economic turmoil triggered by her government’s mini-budget. As the Conservative Party scrambled to restore stability, Sunak was chosen as a unifying candidate and became the party leader unopposed.When Sunak became Prime Minister, the UK was grappling with a profound economic crisis. The pandemic’s aftershocks still reverberated through public health and the economy, while war in Ukraine had disrupted energy supplies and global trade. Sunak’s government faced soaring inflation, energy price shocks, and political instability. His promise to govern with integrity and accountability was tested daily. Despite the challenges, he sought to restore confidence both at home and abroad, emphasizing fiscal responsibility and international cooperation.Despite efforts to stabilize markets and promote fiscal responsibility, Sunak struggled to unite a deeply fractured Conservative Party. Mounting internal tensions, declining public support, and a series of backbench rebellions eventually eroded his authority. In July 2024, facing mounting pressure and a leadership challenge, Sunak announced his resignation as Conservative Party leader, bringing his tenure as Prime Minister to an end.Rishi Sunak’s return to Goldman Sachs as a senior adviser is notable not only because it marks a return to his roots but also because of the role’s unique nature. He will advise clients on macroeconomic and geopolitical issues, drawing on his extensive experience in government and global affairs. Importantly, Sunak will not receive a salary for this position. Instead, any earnings will be donated to the Richmond Project, a charity he co-founded to promote numeracy and education in his constituency. This arrangement reflects a commitment to public service even as he re-engages with the private sector.Rishi Sunak’s comeback to the private sector is not just a career move; it’s an inspiring example of how public service can continue even after leaving office. Unlike many politicians who often retire into comfort, relying on accumulated wealth or government benefits, Sunak is choosing to re-engage professionally in a meaningful way. His decision to take on an advisory role at Goldman Sachs without drawing a salary, and instead donating any earnings to charity, reflects both integrity and a deep sense of responsibility. It sets a strong precedent for how former leaders can remain active contributors to society, not for personal gain, but for a greater public good.Rishi Sunak’s journey embodies a rare blend of high finance and high politics. Few have navigated the worlds of global banking and national leadership with such prominence. His career trajectory, from a young banker in New York to the UK’s highest political office, and now back to the financial sector, illustrates the increasingly interconnected nature of finance and governance in the 21st century. As he steps into this advisory role, Sunak brings a wealth of experience shaped by crises and leadership, poised to influence global economic discussions from a new vantage point.In a world where the lines between public service and private enterprise often blur, Sunak’s return to Goldman Sachs is a vivid example of how careers can evolve in unexpected ways, reflecting both personal ambition and a broader narrative of resilience and adaptability.","Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is returning to Goldman Sachs as a senior adviser.

Bombay Sport Exchange Episode 1: Interview with Sanjog Gupta, CEO (Sports) at JioStar

The International Cricket Council's Annual Conference in Singapore kicked off Thursday with a significant election that saw Gurumurthy Palani (France), Anuraag Bhatnagar (Hong Kong), and Gurdeep Klair (Canada) winning key positions on the Chief Executives' Committee (CEC). The trio emerged victorious from an eight-candidate field, marking a major shift in cricket's global leadership.Palani and Bhatnagar led the pack with 28 votes, while Klair secured 21 votes. The election results brought a notable change as veteran administrator Sumod Damodar, who previously served three terms, failed to retain his position after receiving only 16 votes.The election drew significant attention as three Associate Member seats were available on the influential CEC. This committee plays a crucial role in developing cricket worldwide and managing the sport at the international level. For Associate cricket chiefs, a spot on the CEC is highly valued and often serves as a pathway to the more powerful ICC board.The election featured a diverse group of candidates, including former Hong Kong chief Tim Cutler representing Vanuatu, ex-USA cricket administrator Sankar Renganathan from Sierra Leone, Stella Siale from Samoa, and Sarah Gomersall from Jersey.Two previous committee members, Rashpal Bajwa from Canada and Denmark's Umair Butt, chose not to participate in this election.The outgoing member, Damodar, was known for his bold initiatives, including attempts to revive the Afro-Asia Cup and his advocacy for more major events for Associate nations. Another notable candidate was Renganathan, who gained attention for his vocal criticism of USA Cricket's current challenges.The voting process involved 40 Associate Members and five regional representatives from the Americas, Asia, Europe, East Asia-Pacific, and Africa. According to ICC rules, candidates needed to be either an Associate Member representative or have experience as an ICC director.The newly elected members will serve two-year terms and will also participate in the Associate Member Committee, which oversees governance at the Associate level. This election marks the beginning of a new era for the ICC, now led by Chairman Jay Shah and new CEO Sanjog Gupta, with several important issues set to be discussed during the conference.","Gurumurthy Palani (France), Anuraag Bhatnagar (Hong Kong), and Gurdeep Klair (Canada) won key positions on the Chief Executives' Committee.

BENGALURU: Imagine burning 3 litres of petrol just to travel 1.5 kilometres. That's the grim reality for techies navigating the choked stretch near Ecospace on Bellandur's Sarjapur Road-Outer Ring Road (ORR) corridor. Frustrated commuters Tuesday took to social media, sharing dashboard screenshots that revealed shocking levels of fuel consumption and barely moving traffic.In one case, a commuter reported using 3.2 litres of fuel to cover just 3.3km in 45 minutes. Another said his car guzzled 3 litres over a 1.5km crawl that took 22 minutes. Typically, cars offer mileage between 8 and 15 kmpl, but in these gridlocked conditions, it efficiency nosedived to as low as 3-6 kmpl as helpless techies waited for hours with the engine on to keep the air-conditioning running.""This is outrageous,"" posted Akshay, a software engineer, on X. ""Sarjapur Road traffic is getting out of hand! Every day feels like a test of patience — jam-packed, inch-by-inch movement. When will we see a real solution to this chaos?""Another commuter, Krishna B, posted: ""My car, a Honda Civic, shows I burned nearly 3 litres of fuel just to move 2.1km. It took me close to 50 minutes. That's almost Rs 300 worth of petrol gone, and I didn't even leave my neighbourhood!""Shanaya R, who works in a fintech company near Ecospace and drives an MG Hector, told TOI: ""This is becoming unbearable.On Monday, my fuel consumption was 2.8 litres for just under 2km. I was idling more than moving. The stress of sitting through this every day is worse than workload.""But why did roads in the tech corridor witness crawling traffic? Sources pointed to the new traffic diversions rolled out near Kadubeesanahalli junction on ORR, the pathetic condition of service roads, heavy inflow of private vehicles into tech parks, and reshuffle of the traffic brass as joint commissioner (traffic) MN Anucheth was moved out.Nithin Mallikarjun, a frequent commuter and techie, said: ""We need more infrastructure — extra flyovers, access ramps and underground routes. At the same time, BMTC should improve frequency and companies must bring back bus services."" Ravi Kumar, a resident of Kasavanahalli, added: ""In the time it takes to cross 2.5km, I could've driven to Electronics City and back under normal conditions. The car is literally burning petrol while standing still. It's bad for the wallet, bad for the environment, and even worse for our mental health.""Vishnu Prasad, a member of Save Bellandur Forum, blamed the issue on poor planning. ""The problem is straightforward — people can't even step out of their homes. In Haralur, Kasavanahalli, and Doddakannelli, roads are narrow.

NEW DELHI: Kannada actress Ranya Rao has been sentenced to one year of imprisonment in connection with a gold smuggling case, as per an order issued by the Advisory Board under the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act (COFEPOSA). The board has denied the right to apply for bail for the entire duration of the sentence, as per media reports.Bengaluru court had earlier granted default bail to Ranya and co-accused Tarun Raju on procedural grounds, after the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) failed to file a chargesheet within the stipulated time.Despite the bail, Ranya remained in custody due to ongoing proceedings under COFEPOSA, which allows preventive detention of up to one year based solely on suspicion in cases related to foreign exchange and smuggling violations.Ranya, also known as Harshavardhani Ranya, was arrested on March 3 at Bengaluru’s Kempegowda International Airport with 14.8 kg of gold smuggled from Dubai.

Soham Parekh, the Indian tech professional who became a lightning rod in the global startup ecosystem for simultaneously working full-time jobs at multiple companies, is once again in the public spotlight. Known for triggering widespread discussions around moonlighting ethics, work-life balance, and hustle culture, Parekh now claims that his life has remained “unchanged” following the controversy. In a recent post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), he offered a candid glimpse into his current state of mind, mentioning his daily routine, mental health, and long-term goals, sparking renewed debate across tech circles. His remarks reflect deeper concerns about modern professional life, burnout, and ethical boundaries in remote work.Soham Parekh, a Mumbai-based software engineer, was publicly accused in 2023 of secretly holding full-time roles at multiple US-based startups. The accusations were led by the co-founder of Playground AI and former CEO of Mixpanel Suhail Doshi who alleged that Parekh was drawing salaries from as many as three to four companies simultaneously, some of which were Y Combinator-backed ventures, including Dynamo AI and Synthesia.Parekh later acknowledged these claims, stating in an interview that he was driven by financial distress, which compelled him to accept overlapping roles. He also revealed that he worked up to 140 hours per week, navigating tight deadlines, multiple meetings, and high-performance expectations. While some in the tech community were impressed by his time management and technical capabilities, the majority criticized his actions as unethical, especially because he failed to disclose his dual employment to employers.In his latest public post, Soham Parekh shared a screenshot of a message exchange where someone asked how he manages to work so much. He replied bluntly, “I love what I do. Lol. I don’t have anything else to do.” He added in a follow-up caption, “My life hasn’t changed one bit.”Though casual in tone, the statement quickly went viral, drawing strong reactions. The message struck a chord with many professionals navigating the high-pressure environments of startups, where identity and productivity often overlap. Parekh’s comments reignited discussion around the emotional toll of hustle culture, especially in sectors where overworking is normalized and sometimes even glorified.The moonlighting debate refers to the growing controversy around professionals taking on multiple jobs often simultaneously without informing their primary employer. While moonlighting traditionally meant holding a second job outside regular working hours, the rise of remote work and gig culture has blurred these boundaries, especially in tech and startup industries.At the center of the debate are ethical, legal, and productivity concerns. Some companies view undisclosed secondary employment as a breach of trust or a conflict of interest, especially when employees hold multiple full-time roles. Others, however, argue that moonlighting is a personal right—especially in economies where one job may not be financially sufficient.The moonlighting debate stems from a complex interplay of transparency, contractual obligations, performance expectations, economic realities, and evolving workplace norms. Employers emphasize transparency and trust, arguing that undisclosed secondary jobs raise concerns about divided attention, compromised performance, and potential misuse of confidential information. Employment contracts often explicitly prohibit outside work that might conflict with the company’s interests, further complicating the issue.Critics of moonlighting warn that juggling multiple demanding roles can lead to burnout and reduced productivity, ultimately affecting team outcomes. However, proponents highlight economic necessity, pointing to inflation and stagnant wages as reasons why professionals seek additional income. The rise of remote work post-COVID has only intensified this dynamic, enabling individuals to pursue side gigs or full-time dual roles with less oversight, blurring the lines between flexibility and ethical responsibility.The public response to Parekh’s remarks was mixed and emotionally charged. Many users on social media platforms expressed concern, calling the statement a “cry for help,” while others found it relatable. Some viewed Parekh’s work ethic as admirable, even inspirational, in a results-driven industry where multi-tasking is often seen as a valuable skill.However, others interpreted his message as a symptom of a larger burnout epidemic. They raised questions about mental health, personal fulfillment, and the cost of tying self-worth solely to productivity. The debate also reflected generational shifts in how work and life priorities are viewed—particularly among millennial and Gen Z tech professionals.At the heart of the controversy lies the question of ethics. Moonlighting, particularly without employer consent, presents serious implications in terms of transparency, trust, and data security. While side gigs are common in the tech industry, especially among freelancers and consultants, holding multiple full-time roles simultaneously as Soham Parekh did creates an undeniable conflict of interest.His defenders argue that the industry itself is partly to blame. Many startups demand long hours, deliverables at breakneck speed, and loyalty that often exceeds what compensation justifies. In such an environment, Parekh’s actions have been seen by some as a form of survival, albeit a controversial one. However, critics argue that regardless of intent, undisclosed dual employment undermines accountability and could lead to compromised performance, divided attention, and violations of employment contracts.","Soham Parekh, the Indian tech professional who became a lightning rod for simultaneously working full-time jobs at multiple companies, is once again in the public spotlight.

Who is Larry Ellison? Billionaire surpasses Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg with $275 billion net worth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/who-is-larry-ellison-billionaire-surpasses-jeff-bezos-and-mark-zuckerberg-with-275-billion-net-worth/articleshow/122558869.cms,"Larry Ellison's journey from dropout to tech titan

Oracle's evolution and rise in AI

A billionaire lifestyle with lasting tech impact

In a dramatic reshuffling of the global billionaire rankings, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison has surged to the second spot, overtaking Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg. His net worth has skyrocketed to an estimated $275.9 billion as of July 2025, following a 32% surge in Oracle’s stock in June alone. Ellison, who still owns nearly 41% of the company, gained more than $56 billion in just over a month. The tech mogul's leap in wealth reflects Oracle’s rising influence in cloud computing and AI, making him one of the most powerful figures in the new tech economy, second only to Elon Musk. This marks Ellison’s highest-ever ranking on the global rich list, a testament to his long-term tech bets paying off. It also signals the growing investor appetite for foundational technologies over consumer-facing platforms.Born in 1944 in New York City and raised in a modest Chicago neighborhood by his aunt and uncle, Larry Ellison’s path was far from traditional. He dropped out of two colleges before working as a programmer at companies like Amdahl and Ampex. In 1977, he co-founded Oracle with just $2,000 and two partners, Bob Miner and Ed Oates, inspired by a paper on relational databases from IBM.His outsider status in both academia and business became part of his maverick identity. Ellison’s willingness to take calculated risks defined Oracle’s culture from its earliest days.Oracle’s first big break came when the CIA contracted Ellison’s firm to build a database system, code-named “Oracle.” That deal gave the company both its name and a high-profile launchpad. Within two years, Oracle released the first commercial SQL-based database product, revolutionizing data management.Under Ellison’s leadership, Oracle became the global leader in database software and enterprise technology. Even after stepping down as CEO in 2014, Ellison stayed closely involved as chairman and chief technology officer. His strategic push into cloud computing and AI has paid off handsomely. Ellison’s decision to double down on enterprise AI has enabled Oracle to stay relevant in a rapidly shifting landscape. Rather than chase consumer trends, he focused on powering the backbones of modern businesses.Oracle’s recent growth has been powered by demand for AI-ready infrastructure and enterprise cloud services, placing it in direct competition with tech giants like Amazon and Microsoft. Massive investments in AI, along with strategic acquisitions such as Sun Microsystems and NetSuite, have helped Oracle become a major player in the AI arms race.At 80, Ellison is not only a tech visionary but also one of the world’s most flamboyant billionaires. He owns multiple properties, including a Hawaiian island (Lanai), luxury yachts, and high-end real estate in California and Japan. Despite his wealth, Ellison remains deeply involved in Oracle’s innovation strategy.Ellison’s rise is not just a story of stock gains. It is a reminder that foundational tech infrastructure, often overshadowed by social media and e-commerce, is once again central to the digital economy. From building databases in the 1970s to driving AI innovation in the 2020s, Ellison’s influence spans nearly five decades of tech evolution.","Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison has surged to the second spot, overtaking Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg.

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warns Donald Trump on tariffs



Donald Trump hits out at US Fed Chair Jerome Powell



JPMorgan reported a profit of $14.2 billion



Jamie Dimon , chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase delivered a pointed message to US President Donald Trump during the bank’s second-quarter earnings call. Dimon cautioned that the trade polices of Donald Trump especially the tariffs pose ‘significant risks’ to the US economy. Dimon emphasised on the critical importance of the Federal Reserve’s independence and also cautioned against any interference with its operations.While not directly naming President Donald Trump, Dimon's remarks were widely interpreted as a direct address to the US President. During the earnings call, Dimon praised the tax reforms and the potential deregulation as positives. However, Jamie Dimon also warned that some of the tariffs, trade uncertainty and ongoing geopolitical tensions could hamper the economic resilience. “The finalization of tax reform and potential deregulation are positive for the economic outlook,” Jamie Dimon said, “however, significant risks persist—including from tariffs and trade uncertainty, worsening geopolitical conditions, high fiscal deficits and elevated asset prices”.Dimon’s remarks come during the time when Trump may seek to replace Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell , a move which is strongly being opposed by Dimon. “The independence of the Fed is absolutely critical,” he said, adding that “playing around with the Fed can often have adverse consequences—the absolute opposite of what you might be hoping for”.US President Donald Trump has targeted US Fed Chairman Jerome Powell by calling him ‘incompetent’. In the past also Trump has called out Powell for not cutting rates and also called him a ‘numbskull’ and Mr ‘Too Late’.Trump also posted about Powell in a social media post on Truth Social, “Too Late” Jerome Powell, of the Fed, will be in Congress today in order to explain, among other things, why he is refusing to lower the Rate. Europe has had 10 cuts, we have had ZERO. No inflation, great economy - We should be at least two to three points lower. Would save the USA 800 Billion Dollars Per Year, plus. What a difference this would make. If things later change to the negative, increase the Rate. I hope Congress really works this very dumb, hardheaded person, over. We will be paying for his incompetence for many years to come. THE BOARD SHOULD ACTIVATE. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” wrote Trump.JPMorgan reported a profit of $14.2 billion for the quarter.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's net worth soars $1 billion as the chipmaker joins the $4 trillion club,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huangs-net-worth-soars-1-billion-as-the-chipmaker-joins-the-4-trillion-club/articleshow/122377958.cms,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang

Jensen Huang’s net worth passes $140 billion



Nvidia’s market value climbs above $4 trillion



How a 3.5 percent stake fuels one of the world’s biggest fortunes



Where Jensen Huang now ranks among global billionaires



Why investors keep bidding the price up

AI demand everywhere. Cloud providers, carmakers, and sovereign data-centre projects line up for the current Hopper chips and the coming Blackwell series.

Scarcity premium. Nvidia controls around 80 percent of high-end AI GPU supply, and capacity stays tight even after Taiwan’s fabs ramp up output.

Ecosystem lock-in. CUDA software and support contracts make switching costs high, so even rivals that launch competitive silicon must still lure developers away.

What could slow the rally

Export curbs. The United States still blocks top-tier chips from shipping to China, Nvidia’s largest single-country market outside the U.S.

New competition. AMD, Intel and a clutch of start-ups are readying chips that nibble at Nvidia’s margins, especially in inference workloads.

Rich valuation. At about 40 times forward earnings, the stock leaves little room for an earnings miss; even a small disappointment could yank billions from Huang’s paper wealth.

Nvidia finished trading on July 10 with a market value of just over $4 trillion, the first time any listed firm has crossed that threshold. The jump did more than rewrite Wall Street leaderboards; it also pushed co-founder and Chief Executive Jensen Huang’s fortune past $140 billion. He owns about 3.5 percent of Nvidia, held directly and through family trusts, so every flicker in the share price lands straight in his pocket.Bloomberg’s daily billionaire tally shows Jensen Huang adding roughly $1 billion in a single session, and nearly $28 billion in 2025 so far. That kind of lift puts him shoulder-to-shoulder with household names like Warren Buffett, a spot unthinkable just three years ago. Investors keep paying the premium because Nvidia sells the chips that make modern AI run, from data-centre clusters to enterprise servers. The faster the market grows, the richer Huang becomes.As of the New York closing bell on 10 July, Bloomberg pegged Huang’s net worth at $143 billion, up from about $20 billion in early 2022. That leap happened in stages: $44 billion by mid-2023, $117 billion in late 2024, and now the $140-plus range. Fueled by the AI boom and soaring Nvidia shares, the difference this year alone is bigger than the entire market value of some Fortune 500 firms.The company’s share price settled near $164, capping a run that has lifted the stock 74 percent since April’s low and around 22 percent since January. Nvidia is now the dominant weight in the S&P 500, ahead of Apple and Microsoft. Analysts at Citi, Barclays and Loop Capital all raised their price targets this week, citing demand for the upcoming Blackwell platform and a backlog of data-centre orders.Huang’s percentage looks small beside founder holdings at some other tech giants, yet at a $4 trillion valuation it leaves him with shares worth roughly $140 billion. The stake figure comes from Nvidia’s March 2025 proxy filing and excludes unvested stock units. Cash, past dividend income and secondary-share sales round out the number Bloomberg uses, but the equity slice is what matters daily.With the latest move, he edges into Bloomberg’s global top ten, swapping places with Google’s Larry Page and closing in on Warren Buffett. Forbes, which refreshes less often, lists him ninth. None of the other names in that bracket made their money so fast in so short a window.","N Nvidia finished trading on July 10 with a market value of just over $4 trillion, the first time any listed firm has crossed that threshold.
