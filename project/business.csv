NEW DELHI: Delhi's Patiala House court Thursday allowed 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks plotter Tahawwur Rana to have a phone conversation with his family for the limited purpose of discussing the engagement of a new legal aid counsel.At present, advocate Piyush Sachdeva from Delhi Legal Services Authority is Rana's legal counsel. The Pakistan-born Canadian moved court after Tihar Jail authorities rejected his application to talk to his family over the phone.Rana is allegedly a close aide of David Coleman Headley, alias Daood Gilani, a US citizen and the main conspirator in the attacks that killed 166.On July 15, the court allowed Rana's plea seeking directions to jail authorities to provide him with a bed and a mattress. Authorities had opposed the plea, reasoning that inmates aged 65 or older could be given a bed under the jail manual. Rana is 64. On July 9, after NIA filed a supplementary chargesheet, the court extended Rana's judicial custody until Aug 13. Rana was brought to India after the US Supreme Court dismissed his review plea against extradition on April 4. tnn","Tahawwur Rana moved court after Tihar Jail authorities rejected his application to talk to his family over the phone.

"Typos, technicalities used to deny citizenship claims in Assam: Report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/typos-technicalities-used-to-deny-citizenship-claims-in-assam-report/articleshow/123176575.cms,"Even as citizenship issues are being raised in many parts of the country, a new report questions the legal process followed by the Foreigners Tribunals (FTs) and Gauhati high court in declaring 1.6 lakh people as ""foreigners"" in Assam.According to the report, citizenship was denied on the basis of minor spelling errors and confusion between honorific titles and actual names, while credible oral testimony was dismissed. The findings were based on an analysis of over 1,200 Gauhati HC orders, key Supreme Court judgments, orders of the FTs, and extensive interviews with lawyers and litigants. Among the cases cited are:Barpeta resident Rahman Ali submitted documents for citizenship in 2012, listing his father's name as Khurshed Ali. His claim was rejected a year later with the authorities ruling that this was a discrepancy as his father's name registered as Furshed Ali in the 1965 and 1970 voter rolls, even though it was correctly registered as Khurshed in 1989, 1997 and 2010.Maharjan Nessa's uncle's testimony was dismissed in 2019 because he was unaware of when her father had purchased land in Gobardhana village in Baksa district, a detail irrelevant to her citizenship status.Ibrahim Ali's petition was denied because his father's name appeared as 'Late Nurul' in the 1989 voter roll and 'Nurul Islam' in the 1965 and 1970 voter rolls for Toktoki village in Nagaon district.Besides such rejections, there are over 85,000 pending cases. The FTs are expected to hear a million appeals from those excluded from the National Register of Citizens (NRC). The report titled 'Unmaking Citizens: The Architecture of Rights Violations and Exclusion in India's Citizenship Trials' by the National Law School of India University and Queen Mary University of London describes this as a ""burgeoning crisis"". It argues that the FTs - rather than being flawed exceptions-have become routine instruments of exclusion.The report comes at a time when Parliament has enacted the new Immigration and Foreigners Act, 2025. In this context, the report calls for an urgent, fundamental rethinking of the legal structures governing citizenship in India, calling the current system not just broken, but actively unjust.""Even though the citizenship verification process has ostensibly been carried out under the cover of law and sometimes even under court supervision, our report shows that it fails to align with core constitutional and legal principles,"" says Mohsin Alam Bhat, law professor at Queen Mary University and co-author of the report. ""People are asked to produce unreasonable documentation. Worse, the system is designed to reject even the documentary and oral evidence they do manage to provide. ""Some of the reasons for denying citizenship are against settled law, the report says. For instance, FTs and the Gauhati HC routinely rejected crucial official documents, such as gram panchayat certificates and voter rolls, over minor formatting flaws, inconsistencies in ink color, or the absence of details like specific govt headers. Slight variations in a person's name, title, or age became grounds for denial, even though such inconsistencies are common in rural records. Even when credible witnesses, including family members with direct knowledge, testified to a person's citizenship or familial relationships, their statements were often dismissed just because they could not recall details like the precise year a family moved to a village, the date of a marriage, or a birth date.Additionally, FTs and the HC have routinely dismissed post-1971 documents as ""irrelevant"" or ""not proof of citizenship"". This led to documents like Aadhaar, PAN cards, and ration cards, which could establish continuous residence or familial ties, being summarily rejected.Another challenge has been the steadily weakening qualifications for FT members. In 2011, only retired officials of the judicial service were eligible. By 2015, advocates who had 10 years of experience could be appointed. In 2019, this was further broadened to include civil servants and lawyers with only seven years of experience.The report argues that the courts have not treated these procedural violations as errors of law serious enough to invalidate FT proceedings. Bhat says, ""The high court has adopted the same narrow approach to evidence as the tribunals, rejecting testimony and documents for minor, technical discrepancies without considering them in totality, as settled evidentiary practice would require.""","A new report questions the legal process followed by the Foreigners Tribunals (FTs) in declaring 1.6 lakh people as ""foreigners"" in Assam.

Lone candidate in fray? SC weighs NOTA option,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lone-candidate-in-fray-sc-weighs-nota-option/articleshow/123176466.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday agreed to examine a proposal to make 'none of the above (NOTA)' choice available to voters even when a single candidate is in the fray to enable them to express their approval of him/her, and countermand the elections if NOTA votes exceed votes polled by the candidate.Despite Centre and EC terming NOTA, put in place based on SC's 2013 judgment, a failed idea for the poor response it received from voters, a bench of Justices Surya Kant, Ujjal Bhuyan and N K Singh said, ""It is an interesting question. It is true that elections in India are keenly contested. But imagine a situation where the voters do not want the single candidate in the fray, who would otherwise be elected unopposed, to be their representative in the assembly or Lok Sabha?""Justice Kant added, ""If there is resentment among voters against the single candidate, then the voters will come out in numbers and choose NOTA. If NOTA votes exceed the votes garnered by the single candidate in the fray, then what should be done? This may be academic, but a very interesting question which may require judicial deliberation.""Attorney general R Venkataramani said it was purely a non-plausible concept in the Indian context. For EC, senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi said NOTA had never impacted an election since its inception. Every winning candidate has so far got higher votes than NOTA even though some of the losing candidates had secured less than NOTA votes, he said.However, he said EC would scrupulously conduct elections as mandated by law and the orders of the SC. Additional solicitor general S D Sanjay asked the bench what would happen if an election was countermanded because of NOTA getting more votes than the single candidate in the fray, and a similar situation emerged in the fresh election.Responding to a PIL on the issue filed by 'Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy', EC in its affidavit said candidates getting elected unopposed from a Lok Sabha constituency was very rare. Since 1991, there has been only one such instance, Dwivedi said. ""Since 1971 till today, that is in the last 54 years, there have been six uncontested elections in total. In the 20 general elections since 1951, there have been only nine uncontested elections,"" he added.""Treating NOTA as a mandatorily contesting candidate in all direct uncontested elections does not find place in the statute and the same would require legislative amendments in the provisions of Representation of the People Act, 1951, and the Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961,"" EC said.","Supreme Court agrees to examine proposal to make 'none of the above (NOTA)' choice available to voters even when a single candidate is in the fray.

Yes, they act as a deterrent No, long-term solutions are better

MUMBAI: Western Railway conducted the most extensive fortress ticket-checking drive in Indian Railways' history at Borivli station on Tuesday, booking more than 5,100 ticketless and irregular passengers and collecting Rs 13.5 lakh in fines—the highest single-day ticket checking revenue recorded at any station.The operation was part of WR's newly launched NAMASTE Abhiyaan — short for Namrata Aur Strong Ticket Examination — which aims to curb fare evasion through surprise, high-impact enforcement drives. The crackdown at Borivli involved a deployment of 350 personnel, including 300 ticket checking staff, along with Railway Protection Force (RPF) and govt Railway Police (GRP) support.""This is the largest and most focused ticket-checking operation undertaken on Indian Railways at a single station,"" said Vineet Abhishek, chief public relations officer, WR. ""On a regular day, our suburban section sees around 2,600 cases and earns approximately Rs 8 lakh in revenue. Tuesday's drive at Borivli alone surpassed Rs 13 lakh and booked 5,192 cases — an all-time high for any single station.""Ticket checking staff usually work with shoulder bags containing hand-held terminals (HHTs) and Excess Fare Ticket (EFT) books, making it difficult to navigate overcrowded coaches and AC locals, especially during peak hours.Under NAMASTE, WR has introduced specially designed protective vests that securely hold essential devices like HHTs, EFTs, body cameras, and compact speakers for onboard announcements.""These new vests will significantly improve the mobility and safety of our ticket checking staff,"" Abhishek said. ""They allow devices to be strapped close to the body, reducing clutter and enabling better access in crowded conditions.""WR is also establishing pre-custody areas at major suburban stations to streamline the handling of ticketless or unruly passengers. These zones will operate under CCTV surveillance and follow standardised documentation protocols, reducing congestion at head ticket-checking offices and ensuring greater transparency.Abhishek added that the NAMASTE Abhiyaan will continue with more such surprise drives across key stations in Mumbai to reinforce ticket discipline and improve the overall travel experience for genuine commuters.","Western Railway conducted the most extensive ticket-checking drive in Indian Railways' history at Borivli station on Tuesday.

Finland-based thinktank exposes US double standard,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/finland-based-thinktank-exposes-us-double-standard/articleshow/123151870.cms,"NEW DELHI: European Union countries account for 23% of Russia's revenues from fossil fuel exports against India's 13% since the beginning of the Ukraine conflict, while G7+ tankers are currently transporting more than half of those barrels, data published by CREA (Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air) shows.Indian govt sources here said this further spotlighted Western hypocrisy in targeting India for securing its energy interests, while ignoring similar action by other countries. European Union has been procuring not just energy but also fertilizers, chemicals, iron, steel and transport equipment from Russia.""These figures only vindicate India's emphasis on ensuring for its citizens regular and affordable energy supplies,"" said a source on condition of anonymity.Seen in the backdrop of the US on Wednesday doubling tariff on India to 50% for ""fuelling the Russian war machine"" by buying its oil and last month's EU sanction on Indian refining entity Nayara Energy, the Finland-based independent think-tank's latest report exposes what New Delhi describes as West's ""double standard"" in singling out India.The report says Moscow has raked in EUR 923 billion (92,300 crore) so far from fossil fuel exports such as oil, natural gas, coal, refined fuels and intermediaries.Of this, EUR 212 billion (21,200 crore) came from EU countries compared with EUR 121 billion (12,100 crore) from India. China remained the top bu-yer of Russian energy with a tab of over EUR 200 billion (20,000 crore).The report points out the growing role of G7 tankers in transporting Russian oil since the EU's June sanctions. This underlines the disconnect between western policy and practice pointed out by New Delhi. ""Since Jan, the G7+ share in Russian oil transport has increased from 36% to 56%,"" it says. More than half of Russian seaborne oil exports were transported in G7+ tankers in June, reflecting a six percentage point increase over May.Use of western tanker fleet means those shipments were compliant with the price cap and other terms of the sanctions. India argues it has helped prevent a flare-up in oil prices by buying Russian oil, accounting for about 9% of daily global supply. That is also the key consideration that led the US and the EU to opt for a price cap - rather than choking off the flow with sanctions - for curbing funding for Moscow's war efforts without spooking the oil markets.Overall, however, the report does say that ""Russian fossil fuel revenues in second quarter of 2025 dropped by 18% year-on-year - lowest in a quarter since the invasion of Ukraine. This occurred despite an 8% increase in volumes exported in Q2 compared to Q1 of 2025.""Read | Trump tariffs: Exporters on edge, fear losing orders","European Union countries account for 23% of Russia's revenues from fossil fuel exports.

'Can't act like a crook': Supreme Court's stern words for ED; bench says agency must work 'within four corners of the law',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cant-act-like-a-crook-supreme-courts-stern-words-for-ed-bench-says-agency-must-work-within-four-corners-of-the-law/articleshow/123168101.cms,"Supreme Court; Enforcement Directorate

(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday sternly reminded the Enforcement Directorate (ED) that the central agency must function strictly within the bounds of the law, stating, ""You can’t act like a crook.""A bench comprising Justices Surya Kant, Ujjal Bhuyan, and N Kotiswar Singh made the observation while hearing petitions seeking a review of the top court's July 2022 ruling which upheld ED’s powers of arrest, search, and seizure under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).Appearing for the Centre and ED, additional solicitor general (ASG) SV Raju argued that the review petitions were not maintainable, describing them as mere “disguised appeals” against the earlier verdict. He claimed that “influential crooks” exploit the legal process to delay investigations by filing multiple applications, forcing ED officers to focus on court appearances instead of conducting probes.Justice Bhuyan pushed back, highlighting concerns about the agency’s low conviction rate.""You can't act like a crook, you have to act within the four corners of the law. I observed in one of my judgments that ED has registered around 5,000 ECIRs (enforcement case information report) in the past five years but the conviction rate is less than 10 per cent. We are also concerned about ED’s image. After 5–6 years of custody, if people are acquitted, who takes responsibility?” he said.The ASG further argued that the agency is often ""handicapped"" when ""influential accused"" flee to jurisdictions such as the Cayman Islands. He also pointed out that in 2019, a Supreme Court Constitution bench had already upheld the PMLA’s constitutional validity.The hearing of review petitions will continue next week.","The Supreme Court sternly reminded the Enforcement Directorate that the central agency must function strictly within the bounds of the law.

SC judges take exception to order against HC judge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-judges-take-exception-to-order-against-hc-judge/articleshow/123151364.cms,"NEW DELHI: Top judges of Supreme Court have taken strong exception to the order passed on Tuesday by a bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan castigating an Allahabad high court judge for lack of knowledge in criminal law and de-rostering him from hearing criminal cases for life, and are mulling steps to remedy an unpleasant situation created in breach of repeated SC rulings.A concerned Chief Justice of India B R Gavai consulted his senior colleagues and is now discussing ways and means to remedy the order that has created difficulties for the chief justice (CJ) of one of the oldest high courts of India, at Allahabad.SC has repeatedly ruled that the CJ of an HC is the master of the roster and he alone can allocate, roster and assign cases to single, division and three-judge benches in HC and that his discretion is not amenable to judicial orders.Justices Pardiwala and Mahadevan ordered the Allahabad HC CJ to ""immediately withdraw the present criminal determination from the concerned judge"" and ""make the judge sit in a division bench with a seasoned senior judge"". They also said, ""We further direct that the concerned judge shall not be assigned any criminal determination, till he demits office"".Irrespective of the folly of the HC judge, SC, which gives primacy to principles of natural justice, passed the caustic and damaging order against the judge without giving him an opportunity to explain why he passed the impugned directive.Justices Pardiwala and Mahadevan called the HC judge's order one of the worst they had come across in their tenures as SC judges, and said, ""The judge concerned has not only cut a sorry figure for himself but has made a mockery of justice. We are at our wits' end to understand what is wrong with the Indian judiciary at the level of HC.""TOI spoke to a number of former CJIs, who too expressed concern over the manner in which the bench led by Justice Pardiwala proceeded to castigate the HC judge, stressing that errors in HC orders are not uncommon and are regularly appealed in SC.A judge's mistake in appreciating legal points or facts in a particular case cannot empower SC, while deciding appeals against an HC judgment, to castigate the judge who authored that judgment and take punitive measures like de-rostering him, which, the ex-CJIs said, was the sole prerogative of the HC CJ.Incidentally, the bench of Justices Pardiwala and Mahadevan had fixed timelines for the President and governors to grant or refuse assent to bills passed by state assemblies, while granting ""deemed approval"" to bills pending with the TN governor. The President has since sent a reference to SC seeking its opinion on whether the apex court has the power to fix timelines for her and governors when the Constitution does not provide for the same, and whether SC can use powers under Article 142 to grant deemed approval to bills.In the case of Braj Kishore Thakur vs. Union of India (1997), SC had ruled: ""Higher courts must remind themselves constantly that higher tiers are provided in the judicial hierarchy to set right errors which could possibly have crept in findings or orders of courts at the lower tiers. Such powers are certainly not for belching diatribe at judicial personages in lower cadre. It is best to remember the words of a jurist that 'a judge who has not committed any error is yet to be born'. ..""In Rajasthan vs Prakash Chand (1997), another three-judge bench said ""that the administrative control of HC vests in the chief justice alone. On the judicial side, however, he is only the first amongst equals. The CJ is the master of the roster. He alone has the prerogative to constitute benches of the court and allocate cases to the benches so constituted. The puisne judges can only do that work as is allotted to them by the chief justice or under his directions. No judge or judges can give directions to the Registry for listing any case before him or them which runs counter to the directions given by the chief justice."" This ruling was made applicable to SC by a three-judge bench's judgment in 2018.","Justices Pardiwala and Mahadevan called the HC judge's order one of the worst they had come across in their tenures as SC judges.

Adolescent romance can't be grounds to lower age of consent: Government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/adolescent-romance-cant-be-grounds-to-lower-age-of-consent-government/articleshow/123176378.cms,"6 Anti-aging foods to reverse the clock

No intention to bring bill in Parl to lower age of consent: Govt

NEW DELHI: The Centre told Supreme Court Thursday that diluting the age of consent from 18 to 16 years would make young girls vulnerable to predators within and outside their family but conceded courts could exercise judicial discretion to determine whether an alleged 'rape' was actually adolescent romance warranting leniency.The Centre said, ""Diluting age of consent or introducing exceptions in the guise of adolescent romance would not only be legally unsound but also dangerous, as it would provide a defence mechanism even to those abusers who exploit the child's emotional dependence or silence.""In its written submissions settled by additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati, govt said in a minuscule number of cases, where adolescents out of emotional curiosity or mutual attraction, may engage in romantic or physical relationships, courts must carefully scrutinise such instances on a case-by-case basis, using discretion and sensitivity to the facts.However, the Centre said it has no intention to bring a legislation in Parliament to lower the age of consent. ""This judicial discretion, however, is distinct from legislative dilution. The moment the statute begins to generalise such exceptions, it weakens the bright-line protective standard that currently acts as a deterrent and shield for all children,"" it said.Attempts to reduce the age of consent under the IPC/BNS was contrary to the legislative intent and undermined the protective object of the provision, as envisaged through the application of the 'mischief rule' of statutory interpretation, it said. The Centre quoted a nearly two-decade-old study by the WCD ministry, which found that 53.2% of children reported facing one or more forms of sexual abuse, and 50% of abusers were persons in positions of trust or authority, such as parents, relatives, neighbours or school staff.",The Centre told Supreme Court diluting the age of consent from 18 to 16 years would make young girls vulnerable to predators.

SC says evaluate NEET booklets manually,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-says-evaluate-neet-booklets-manually/articleshow/123176281.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a setback for National Testing Agency (NTA), Supreme Court has ordered manual evaluation of a NEET-UG 2025 answer sheet after a candidate alleged that the question paper was stapled incorrectly, resulting in a jumbled sequence of questions. The direction comes amid growing criticism that NTA has failed to adequately address students' grievances, with some even being told to seek redressal ""from courts.""Despite repeated representations by candidates about faulty booklets and scoring discrepancies, NTA has largely maintained that its processes are foolproof. However, in this case, SC took serious view of the complaint and rejected NTA's suggestion that no real harm was caused.TOI on June 11, in its report titled ""Students raise serious concerns over errors in NEET-UG papers"" highlighted the issue. Candidates interviewed had flagged faulty booklets with jumbled page orders, stating they marked incorrect answers due to mismatch between questions and the OMR sheet. When asked specifically about such instances, NTA responded by saying, ""There are four series of question papers. The jumbling is thus of four types.There are four sets of keys. These are applicable to the respective series."" Students, however, said this response ignored cases where jumbling was not just due to booklet series but stapling or printing errors. ""We were told that nothing could be done and that we should take it up legally if we had a problem,"" said a candidate from Odisha.In this particular case before the top court, the petitioner claimed the sequencing in his paper was highly erratic - running from question numbers 1 to 27, followed by 54 to 81, then 28 to 53, 118 to 151, 82 to 117, and 152 to 180. This disordered layout, he argued, made it virtually impossible to match the questions correctly with the standard serial OMR sheet, which was in the expected 1 to 180 format.In its Aug 5 order, SC said, ""We have heard learned ASG (additional solicitor general) appearing for the respondent(s). She has submitted a copy of the question paper in order to explain that there was a mistake merely in the stapling of the question paper which led to erroneous sequencing in as much as sequencing was not in seriatim and that this could not have caused any prejudice to the petitioner herein."" ""However, in order to satisfy ourselves, we direct that the petitioner's paper shall be evaluated manually and the result of the evaluation be placed on the record. The said exercise shall be carried out within a period of one week,"" it had said.","Supreme Court orders manual evaluation of a NEET-UG 2025 answer sheet.

1 lakh fake voters in Karnataka seat that BJP swept in 2024: Rahul Gandhi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/1-lakh-fake-voters-in-karnataka-seat-that-bjp-swept-in-2024-rahul-gandhi/articleshow/123175972.cms,"NEW DELHI: Following through on his claim of ""atom bomb evidence of voter manipulation"" in favour of governing BJP, Congress' Rahul Gandhi on Thursday said over one lakh voters were downright fake in Mahadevapura assembly seat that BJP swept to narrowly win Bangalore Central Lok Sabha constituency in 2024. There are eight segments in the LS seat.He accused EC of colluding with BJP to ""destroy Indian democracy and steal elections"", and argued that if EC now does not provide electronic voters' data of 10-15 years and CCTV footage, then it is ""partaking in crime"" since the two are now ""evidence of crime"". He urged the judiciary to intervene to save Indian democracy.Addressing a press conference in the form of data point presentation of Congress' Mahadevapura study, with the national anthem played at the end, Rahul said, ""This is a crime being committed against the Constitution, Indian flag... I want the nation to know that there is a huge criminal fraud being perpetrated on India by EC and the party in office.""Citing the study, Rahul claimed BJP won Bangalore Central by 32,707 votes while 1,00,250 fake votes were polled for it. He said fake votes were in five categories - duplicate voters (11,965), fake/invalid addresses (40,009), bulk voters in one address (10,452), invalid photos of voters (4,132) and ""misuse of Form 6"" for becoming first-time voter (33,692).Showing files, he cited examples to assert people have voted multiple times in different booths of the seat, while addresses shown on voters' lists are like ""Street 0"", ""House no 0"". He said there were as many as 80 voters shown in one address, even 50 in one-bedroom house, while attempts to cross-check resulted in beating up of researchers or confirmation that they did not live there.Rahul said it is famously claimed that first-time voters vote for PM Modi, but Form 6 instances in Mahadevapura showed there were no first-time voters in the 18-23 age group, and instead the age group was in 90s and 50s, etc.""This is how Bangalore Central was stolen. The reason EC does not provide us data is because it is happening across country,"" he said, adding, ""The difference between (BJP) winning and (Congress) losing in Haryana polls was 22,779 votes, and in one Karnataka assembly seat they have stolen four times of that vote."" He said there is a pattern of BJP winning an LS seat by sweeping a solitary assembly segment, underlining, ""Modi is PM by a slender majority of 25 seats.

Any adverse impact on the credibility of the institution could prove dear,"" it said, adding that no judge, be it in trial courts, HCs or in the SC, is above the law.SC also scotched attempts by Justice Varma to fault the process of inquiry and the CJI's decision in not giving him a personal hearing prior to recommending his removal. It said, ""The CJI has scrupulously followed the in-house procedure, which does not envisage a hearing to be given to the judge under probe after he has expressed his inability to resign or voluntarily retire.""Writing the 57-page judgment that surgically resected the core of argument senior advocate Kapil Sibal had made to shield the judge's intriguing behaviour post-discovery of sacks of burning cash at his official residence in Lutyens' Delhi on March 14 night and his participation in the inquiry without protest, Justice Datta said, ""Justice Varma's conduct does not inspire much confidence for us to entertain the writ petition.The bench faulted him for not raising objections in time to either the uploading of videos of the burning cash on the SC website, process of inquiry, findings of the committee and recommendation for removal, and questioned the audacity of the judge to doubt the legal sanction behind the in-house procedure.The only solace to Justice Varma was the bench's remark that since the entire inquiry process is essentially confidential, the then CJI could have avoided being too fair and transparent and not uploaded the video of the burning cash, since it was not required under the in-house procedure. At the same time, Justice Datta pointed out that the judge did not protest the uploading of the video at a relevant time.Justice Datta said even if the CJI had not made any recommendation for Justice Varma's removal, ""Parliament's power to initiate proceedings for removal of a judge for alleged misbehaviour or incapacity remains unfettered"". It can be initiated even when the committee finds the judge not guilty, it said.""The power, competence, authority and jurisdiction of Parliament to decide what is in the best interests of the nation is left untrammelled by the in-house procedure; hence, it is fallacious to argue that the in-house procedure is a parallel and extra-constitutional mechanism for removal of a Judge,"" Justices Datta and Masih said.The bench said it would be quixotic to argue that the in-house inquiry is a removal mechanism. It is only to help the CJI to take a prima facie view of a judge's alleged misconduct and decide whether or not to recommend the govt to initiate removal motion in Parliament.Rejecting aspersions on the CJI's actions after the inquiry report, the bench said, ""We have no hesitation to say that the CJI is not a mere post office between the inquiry committee and the President/PM that the report is to be forwarded without any remarks/recommendation.

""What is this procedure of filing MAs two years after judgment was pronounced? The practice of waiting for judges, who delivered the judgment, to retire to file such an application is deplorable and amounts to forum shopping,"" he said.Taking a cue, Raju said these are influential and powerful people with huge money bags and they can resort to any tactics.This triggered Justice Bhuyan, who said, ""The crooks under investigation can resort to any tactics, but ED cannot behave like a crook. It has to investigate cases in accordance with law and the procedure laid down.""Justice Bhuyan also flagged the low conviction rate in PMLA cases filed by ED. ""I have observed in one of my judgments that ED has registered more than 5,000 ECIRs in the last five years but the rate of conviction is less than 10%.

Brazilian government slammed the ad for reinforcing harmful gender stereotypes

Hope defended the campaign, calling it humorous and misunderstood

Years before brands were regularly called out for sexism in advertising, a 2011 lingerie campaign featuring supermodel Gisele Bündchen ignited a heated debate in Brazil. The TV ad meant to promote the lingerie brand Hope, showed Gisele in revealing underwear as she “lightened the blow” while delivering bad news to her husband. In one scene, she confesses to crashing his car, but only after stripping down to lingerie.While the brand aimed for humor, the Brazilian government didn’t find it funny.Government officials from Brazil’s Secretariat for Women’s Policies called the campaign out for promoting regressive and discriminatory gender roles. In a strongly worded statement, they said: “The campaign promotes the misguided stereotype of a woman as a sexual object of her husband and ignores the major advances we have achieved in deconstructing sexist practices and thinking.”They added that the ad encouraged women to use their bodies and “charm” to manipulate their partners, which they argued was deeply harmful and counterproductive to the fight against sexism.“The model, Gisele Bündchen, encourages Brazilian women to use their 'charm' to lessen possible reactions from their partners. The ad contains discriminatory content against women,” the officials continued.In response to the criticism, Hope's director Sandra Chayo defended the ad, insisting it was never meant to demean women.She said:“It would be absurd for us, who make a living off the preferences of women, to do anything to devalue our main consumer.”The company emphasized the intent was to use humor to showcase the “natural sensuality of Brazilian women,” something they claimed was internationally recognized and celebrated.Also Read: “New wifey role”: Veronika Rajek’s love confession to Tom Brady sparks fury after Gisele Bündchen heartbreak Over a decade later, the Gisele Bündchen lingerie ad remains a notable case study in how cultural norms, humor, and gender politics collide and how public opinion can force a powerful conversation on representation in advertising.","Brazilian government slammed the ad for reinforcing harmful gender stereotypes.

A groundbreaking geological study has revealed a previously underestimated natural threat lurking beneath Canada’s remote northern frontier. The Tintina fault, stretching over 1,000 kilometers across the Yukon and northwest Canada, long thought to be dormant, is now confirmed as an active seismic hazard. Scientists from the University of Victoria, the Geological Survey of Canada, and the University of Alberta have uncovered compelling evidence that this fault is dangerously overdue for a major earthquake potentially a magnitude 7.5 or greater. With modern imaging technologies revealing recent geological ruptures and tectonic strain accumulating silently for over 12,000 years, this discovery challenges existing national seismic models. The findings raise urgent questions about infrastructure safety, emergency preparedness, and seismic risk in a region largely unprepared for such a powerful event.The Tintina fault is a major lateral strike-slip fault, similar in nature to California’s infamous San Andreas Fault. This type of fault moves horizontally as tectonic plates slide past each other. Stretching more than 1,000 kilometers, it has historically shifted over 450 kilometers, shaping the geology of northwestern Canada.Previously, scientists believed the fault had been inactive for tens of millions of years. However, new research using high-resolution satellite, drone, and airplane imaging reveals otherwise. These modern techniques allow researchers to detect subtle yet significant surface changes known as fault scarps — ridges formed by past earthquake ruptures.Using lidar (light detection and ranging) technology mounted on drones and aircraft, combined with data from the ArcticDEM satellite project, the research team identified a 130-kilometer section of the Tintina fault showing unmistakable signs of seismic ruptures during the Quaternary Period — spanning the last 2.6 million years.This pattern confirms that the fault has remained geologically active into recent history, overturning assumptions of dormancy.Dr. Theron Finley, lead author and geologist at the University of Victoria, explains that the Tintina fault has been accumulating tectonic strain for over 12,000 years at a rate between 0.2 and 0.8 millimeters per year. This accumulated energy is expected to be released in a major seismic event, potentially registering a magnitude 7.5 or greater earthquake, with the potential to impact both natural landscapes and human settlements across the Yukon region.Such an earthquake could cause widespread devastation, especially given the proximity of the historic town of Dawson City, located just 20 kilometers from the fault scarps. The town, known for its Gold Rush heritage and fragile wooden structures, lacks the earthquake-resistant infrastructure found in other regions like British Columbia or California.The dangers posed by the Tintina fault extend beyond ground shaking. The surrounding terrain is highly susceptible to landslides, many already showing signs of instability:A strong earthquake could trigger these slopes to collapse, sending millions of tons of earth into nearby valleys or waterways. This could block rivers, destroy property, disrupt ecosystems, and put communities at serious risk.One of the most alarming aspects of this discovery is that the Tintina fault is not currently included as an active seismic source in Canada’s National Seismic Hazard Model (NSHM). This model guides building codes, engineering practices, and emergency preparedness across the country.In response to the new findings, Natural Resources Canada officials have confirmed plans to update the NSHM to incorporate the Tintina fault data. These changes are expected to influence:The research took place on the traditional territories of the Tr'ondëk Hwëch'in and Na-Cho Nyäk Dun First Nations, who have been engaged in the process. Sharing these findings with local governments and emergency managers ensures that those most affected are informed and can participate in developing resilience strategies.While precise prediction of earthquakes remains impossible, geological evidence indicates that the Tintina fault is approaching the end of its current seismic cycle. According to Dr. Finley: “This fault has been silent for over 12,000 years. That’s well within the recurrence interval for a fault of this size and behavior. It’s not a question of if, it’s a question of when.”The scientific consensus urges immediate action to update hazard assessments, reinforce infrastructure, and bolster preparedness across Canada’s northern frontier. Failure to act could expose communities to an unprecedented disaster in modern Canadian history.","The Tintina fault, stretching over 1,000 kilometers across the Yukon and northwest Canada, long thought to be dormant, is now confirmed as an active seismic hazard.

New Jersey Devils and Luke Hughes reportedly agree on seven-year contract extension amid NHL offseason negotiations

NHL salary cap , internal contract structure shaping New Jersey Devils’ strategy in Luke Hughes negotiations

The New Jersey Devils and young star defenseman Luke Hughes are reportedly on the same page regarding a long-term contract extension. While a deal has not yet been finalized, both sides are said to agree on the term length, with talks focused on finalizing the annual value. However, salary cap limitations could play a role in how quickly the deal gets done ahead of training camp.According to Sportsnet’s Luke Fox, the Devils and Luke Hughes are aligned on a contract length of seven years, a deal structure that mirrors those previously signed by New Jersey’s other core players. Both Nico Hischier and Jack Hughes inked long-term contracts upon completing their entry-level deals, and Luke appears set to follow the same path.Unlike most restricted free agents, Hughes carries 10.2(c) status, which makes him ineligible for offer sheets. That has allowed both sides to negotiate without immediate outside pressure. The standout defender, coming off an impressive rookie season, is expected to command an average annual value higher than Jack Hughes’ $8 million AAV. However, the Devils appear hesitant to set a new internal salary ceiling unless absolutely necessary.As of now, the Devils have just $6.1 million in available cap space, according to PuckPedia. However, that figure is somewhat misleading, as it assumes a full 23-man roster and doesn’t yet account for the likely long-term injured reserve placement of defenseman Johnathan Kovacevic, who is recovering from knee surgery. That LTIR move would free up additional space.Still, New Jersey must proceed cautiously. The team already has high-salary players like Dougie Hamilton ($9M AAV) and Timo Meier ($8.8M AAV) on the books. With other key contracts looming and limited flexibility, any big new deal must be carefully calculated. There has also been speculation around potential cap-clearing trades involving veterans like Ondrej Palat, though his no-movement clause complicates matters.The Devils and Luke Hughes appear well-positioned to finalize a long-term deal, with the biggest hurdle now being annual salary. Despite current cap challenges, the shared commitment to a seven-year extension reflects the organization’s trust in Hughes as a cornerstone. With training camp approaching, all signs point toward a deal coming together sooner rather than later.Also Read: NHL Trade Rumors: Lane Hutson contract talks heat up with Montreal Canadiens, likely comparable to Noah Dobson deal","New Jersey Devils and Luke Hughes reportedly agree on seven-year contract extension amid NHL offseason negotiations.

"‘Fair-skinned newborns up to Rs 5 lakh’: Ghaziabad police bust gang selling babies, prices fixed by skin tone, gender for childless couples; 4 held",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/owners-of-marriage-bureau-among-four-nabbed-in-child-trafficking-case/articleshow/123173974.cms,"Representative Image

So, how did they operate?

GHAZIABAD: Two women who own marriage bureaus in Muzaffarnagar and Shamli were among four persons arrested for allegedly running a child trafficking racket that involved abducting babies and selling them to childless couples across various states.The gang, according to police, targeted fair-skinned newborns, who fetched them anything up to Rs 5 lakh. The rate — upwards of Rs 1.5 lakh — depended on the child's gender and skin tone. Police are also looking for a nurse attached to a Moradabad hospital and an Asha worker in connection with the racket, suggesting the possible involvement of health facilities in selling off babies.The four arrested gang members are Naved Ansari (19), Afsar (28), Swati alias Shaista (35), and Sandhya Chauhan (37). Sandhya operated the Subharti Marriage Bureau in Muzaffarnagar, while Swati ran Pari Marriage Bureau in Moradabad. Afsar owned a meat shop in Tronica City while Naved was a daily wager.The gang is believed to have trafficked more than 10 babies over the past three years. The veil was lifted off the racket after police traced an abductor to a house in Loni and rescued a one-year-old boy on Thursday.The police probe began after the boy's father, Rashid, lodged a complaint about his missing son, who was last seen playing outside their house in Tronica City.CCTV footage from nearby bus stands and railway stations was scrutinised, leading to the identification of a man carrying the child.The cops traced the man to the house in Loni, where the child was found with a woman. The woman said Naved had given her the boy, claiming that his mother had eloped.Police investigation revealed that a couple from Moradabad had initially shown interest in taking the boy for Rs 2.5 lakh. But when they backed out, the gang contacted another couple in Amroha, who agreed to pay Rs 1.5 lakh. Naved, according to cops, had kept the baby boy in the Loni house for only a couple of hours when police barged in and rescued him.It was Afsar who had tipped off Naved about the child playing outside his house on Tuesday. Afsar, who was promised a commission for information on the boy, told interrogators that he was under mounting debt because his meat shop was shut during the month of Sawan.ACP Siddharth Gautam said the gang had spread its tentacles to Delhi, Bijnor, Moradabad, Roorkee, Amroha, and possibly Jammu & Kashmir and Nepal.The gang's members would randomly click photos of children playing and circulate them on social media, particularly WhatsApp groups. Swati and Sandhya, who had contacts of couples who came to their marriage bureaus, would reach out to them with photos of the babies, especially if they were childless after years of tying the knot.The rates would then be discussed, depending on the gender and complexion of the child.Nurse Ranjhana alias Reeta of Moradabad and Asha worker Deepak Singh would also give information on children from their health facilities, particularly those born to women with unwanted pregnancies and from poor background. Initial investigation revealed that Reeta was active in the gang for two years and a half. She would transfer babies to the other gang members after misleading women patients that they had delivered a stillborn.The cops said they had recovered several incriminating chats from the mobile phones of the accused women. The chats included discussions with Reeta and Deepak about selling the children and their possible rates.An FIR was registered against the arrested accused under Section 143 (4) (trafficking) of the BNS at Tronica City police station.""We plan to add more charges as the investigation progresses,"" an officer said.","The gang targeted fair-skinned newborns, who fetched anything up to Rs 5 lakh.

More than just numbers

What's next?





BENGALURU: Bengaluru's Namma Metro is set to cement its position as the second-largest metro network in India, following the imminent commissioning of its much-anticipated Yellow Line.The new 19-km corridor, connecting RV Road to Bommasandra, is expected to expand the city's Metro footprint to 96km of operational track — offering a buffer as Hyderabad rapidly scales up its Metro ambitions.SEE ALSO: Bengaluru techies, this line’s for you: Yellow Line promises smoother rides to Electronic City (photos) The Purple and Green Lines, currently the mainstay of the Bengaluru Metro system, collectively span nearly 77km and serve 69 stations. The East-West Purple Line stretches across 43.5km with 38 stations, while the North-South Green Line covers 33.5km with 31 stations.Together, these lines have been moving an average of 8 lakh passengers daily, a number that is expected to surge significantly once the Yellow Line begins full-scale operations.With this expansion, BMRCL not only boosts intra-city connectivity — particularly linking major industrial hubs in the city's south — but also shores up its standing in India's urban mobility leaderboard.SEE ALSO: Big Relief for Bengaluru commuters: RV Road to Bommasandra, Yellow Line to give city's IT belt new lifeline; PM Narendra Modi to inaugurate on August 10 While Delhi Metro remains far ahead with a staggering 395-km network (including NCR), it's the battle for second place that has grown more intense. Hyderabad Metro , which currently spans around 69km, has been gaining ground quickly thanks to its efficient operations and growing ridership base.As of 2024, Hyderabad clocked in a reported daily ridership of 5.3 lakh and is set to add more corridors under its Phase II expansion.That momentum has placed pressure on BMRCL to keep up the pace — and the Yellow Line might just arrive in time to retain Bengaluru's second-place status, at least for now.The Yellow Line's opening is about more than retaining a rank. It connects tech parks, manufacturing clusters, and dense residential areas in Bengaluru's southern corridor, potentially shifting thousands of commuters off congested roads and onto rail.Transport planners are optimistic that this line will not only absorb a chunk of the city's infamous traffic but also trigger a ripple effect, even as criticism about low frequency owing to just three trains being available rents the air.Even as the Yellow Line opens, eyes are already on the Pink Line (Gottigere–Nagawara) and Blue Line (Central Silk Board–KR Puram-KIA) corridors, both under construction. Their completion in the next few years could push Bengaluru well past the 170-km mark — assuming projects stay on track.With Hyderabad's ambitions on full throttle, Namma Metro will need to keep building — and fast.","Bengaluru's Namma Metro is set to cement its position as the second-largest metro network in India, following the imminent commissioning of its much- anticipated Yellow Line.

Tesla’s defense: distracted driving

Implications for Tesla’s Autopilot safety record



Broader consequences for Tesla’s legal exposure





A Florida jury has ordered Tesla to pay $243 million in damages to the family of a 22-year-old woman who died in a 2019 crash involving a Model S sedan equipped with Tesla’s Autopilot driver-assistance technology. The case, centered around allegations that Tesla’s Autopilot system failed to prevent the fatal collision, marks one of the largest verdicts ever against the electric vehicle giant. While Tesla argued that driver behavior caused the accident, the jury found the company partly liable for the death, amplifying concerns about the safety of Tesla’s semi-autonomous driving technology.In April 2019, George McGee was driving a 2019 Tesla Model S near Key Largo, Florida, with Autopilot engaged. McGee dropped his phone and bent down to retrieve it, diverting attention from the road. The vehicle failed to detect a parked Chevrolet Tahoe at an intersection, and McGee did not brake or steer away. The Tesla struck a couple standing nearby—22-year-old Naibel Benavides Leon, who died, and her boyfriend Dillon Angulo, who suffered severe injuries.The plaintiff’s attorneys contended that Tesla’s Autopilot was defective, focusing on its inability to detect stationary vehicles at intersections and its design limitations for controlled-access highways only.Tesla’s promotion of Autopilot as highly capable, without adequate warnings about these limits, was a critical issue.Tesla maintained that the crash was primarily the result of driver distraction and error. McGee admitted to looking for his dropped phone moments before the collision and was traveling at approximately 62 mph in a 45 mph zone. Tesla emphasized that no vehicle could have avoided the accident under those conditions and stated that their cars meet all required safety standards.This verdict arrives amidst growing scrutiny of Tesla’s Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (FSD) technologies. Critics argue the ruling highlights real safety risks associated with Tesla’s autonomous driving systems, especially outside limited highway conditions. The company’s liability in this high-profile case may lead to heightened regulatory attention and encourage further litigation related to its driver assistance technology.The $243 million verdict includes $200 million in punitive damages and $43 million in compensatory damages, with Tesla found 33% responsible for the incident. The driver was found 67% liable but is not financially responsible as he was not a defendant. Legal experts see this verdict as a pivotal precedent regarding automaker accountability for semi-autonomous driving system failures. Tesla has announced plans to appeal the decision.",A Florida jury has ordered Tesla to pay $243 million in damages to the family of a 22-year-old woman who died in a 2019 crash.

"Anand Mahindra reacts to Trump’s tariffs: ""India should seize this moment like 'Amrit' from a global Manthan""",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/social/anand-mahindra-reacts-to-trumps-tariffs-india-should-seize-this-moment-like-amrit-from-a-global-manthan/articleshow/123166411.cms,"Reforms, not reactions: What Anand Mahindra suggests India must do

Unleashing the power of tourism as a forex engine

A broader economic agenda for resilience and growth

Learning from unintended global consequences

Turning adversity into advantage

In the wake of US President Donald Trump’s move to double tariffs on Indian imports, industrialist Anand Mahindra has called for a bold and strategic response from India. Drawing a powerful analogy from Indian mythology, Mahindra urged the nation to extract 'Amrit', opportunity and growth, from the 'Manthan' or global churn caused by escalating trade wars. He emphasized that instead of viewing the tariffs as a setback, India should treat them as a catalyst for internal reforms, economic acceleration, and a repositioning of its global image as a trusted investment destination.According to Mahindra, incremental reforms are no longer sufficient. He emphasized the need for India to radically improve its ease of doing business, beginning with a truly functional single-window clearance system for all investment proposals. While acknowledging that states control many investment-related regulations, he proposed forming a coalition of willing states that align with a central national platform to demonstrate India’s ability to move with speed, simplicity, and predictability.Such measures, Mahindra believes, will not only help neutralize the impact of tariffs but also transform India into a magnet for global capital. In a world where trusted partnerships are in high demand, India has a unique opportunity to present itself as a dependable, long-term destination for investors.Mahindra also flagged tourism as a massively underutilized asset in India’s economic strategy. He called for the urgent need to accelerate visa processing, improve infrastructure for foreign visitors, and create dedicated tourism corridors around existing hotspots. These corridors, he said, must prioritize security, sanitation, and hygiene to attract international travelers and serve as templates for other regions.Tourism, Mahindra argued, has the potential to generate enormous foreign exchange, boost local employment, and revitalize India’s image on the world stage if treated as a strategic sector.Mahindra did not stop at investment and tourism. He laid out a broader framework aimed at ensuring long-term economic resilience. Key priorities include liquidity support for MSMEs, acceleration of infrastructure investment, and a manufacturing push through the enhancement and expansion of the PLI (Production-Linked Incentive) schemes.He also urged policymakers to rationalize import duties, especially those on raw materials and components critical to manufacturing, to help make Indian products globally competitive.In his remarks, Mahindra highlighted how other countries are using the global tariff war to address long-standing economic inefficiencies. Germany, for example, is rethinking its fiscal orthodoxy, opening doors to greater defense and infrastructure spending, while Canada is making efforts to break down long-standing internal trade barriers.These examples, he suggested, show how external pressure can trigger internal transformation. For India, the question is whether it can also use this moment of global churn to create positive, long-term consequences for its own economy.Mahindra concluded his remarks with a message that balanced realism with optimism. Acknowledging that nations like the US will always prioritize their own interests, he stressed that India should be no different. The goal, he said, should not be to complain but to adapt, reform, and rise.“Just as the 1991 forex reserves crisis triggered liberalization,” Mahindra wrote, “can today’s global manthan over tariffs yield some ‘amrit’ for us?” His call to action was clear: let India use this moment to shape its own destiny intentionally, ambitiously, and decisively.","Industrialist Anand Mahindra has called for a bold and strategic response from India.

Newlyweds Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez were recently spotted hosting Leonardo DiCaprio and his model girlfriend Vittoria Ceretti aboard their $485 million superyacht Koru . The high-profile outing took place off the coast of Ibiza, a popular celebrity hotspot and luxury summer getaway destination. Leonardo DiCaprio, known for his understated style, wore a plain white T-shirt, shorts, and his trademark baseball cap and sunglasses. Vittoria Ceretti showcased her model figure in a strapless blue top and black yoga pants. Bezos opted for tropical-printed swim trunks paired with a navy T-shirt, while Sánchez layered a printed kimono over a bikini. Their casual vacation looks perfectly captured the relaxed yet exclusive atmosphere aboard one of the world’s most extravagant and expensive private yachts, making headlines among luxury lifestyle and celebrity news followers worldwide.Bezos’s superyacht Koru, meaning “new beginnings” in Māori, represents the couple’s extravagant lifestyle and new chapter together. Built by Dutch shipbuilder Oceanco, Koru stands as the world’s tallest sailing yacht, measuring 250 feet tall with three masts exceeding 230 feet each.At 416 feet wide, the yacht features three luxury decks, multiple lounges, and ultra-modern amenities. Its construction spanned five years, costing an estimated $485 million. The yacht previously sparked controversy when plans to dismantle a historic Rotterdam bridge emerged to allow Koru’s passage, leading to widespread public protests and alternative solutions by the builders.Leonardo DiCaprio’s attendance at Bezos and Sánchez’s Venetian wedding drew backlash, with critics calling him a “hypocrite” due to his outspoken environmental activism. Social media users highlighted the contradiction between DiCaprio’s climate advocacy and the carbon-heavy nature of celebrity private jet travel, pointing out that over 90 jets reportedly flew into Venice for the wedding.Despite the criticism, DiCaprio’s friendship with Bezos remains strong, as evidenced by their repeat vacations together including last year’s luxury yacht trip in Sardinia. One of the wedding’s most surprising attendees was Sydney Sweeney, who reportedly had no close personal connection to Bezos or Sánchez. Later reports revealed that Bezos and Sánchez are investing in Sweeney’s upcoming lingerie line, explaining her presence at the event. This move demonstrates how the Bezos-Sánchez social circle extends beyond personal relationships to professional collaborations, further solidifying their influence in both business and Hollywood circles.The Bezos-Sánchez lifestyle showcases a blend of ultra-luxury living, A-list networking, and strategic business alliances. Whether it’s a $40 million Venetian wedding, a $485 million yacht, or investments in rising Hollywood talent, the couple has firmly positioned themselves at the center of celebrity culture and high society.Just weeks before their Ibiza yacht trip, Bezos and Sánchez tied the knot in an opulent $40 million wedding in Venice. The three-day celebration attracted global headlines not just for its extravagance but also for the massive celebrity turnout, including Oprah Winfrey, Orlando Bloom, and Sydney Sweeney.Despite public protests in Venice over the event’s scale, insiders revealed that the wedding was surprisingly intimate. No non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) were required for guests, allowing attendees to freely share their experiences. The bride’s $5 million diamond ring became a symbol of the wedding’s lavishness and continues to be a topic of discussion among jewelers and fans alike.","Bezos-Sánchez lifestyle showcases blend of ultra-luxury living, A-list networking, and strategic business alliances.

Poll Do you support India's bid to host the 2030 Commonwealth Games? Yes, definitely! No, I don't think so.

NEW DELHI: India’s campaign to host the 2030 Commonwealth Games has taken a decisive step forward, with a high-level delegation from Commonwealth Sport completing a three-day inspection of Ahmedabad’s sporting infrastructure.The delegation, led by Darren Hall, Director of Games & Assurance at Commonwealth Sport, arrived in Gujarat’s capital on Tuesday to assess proposed venues and hold meetings with state officials. The visit follows India’s formal expression of interest to host the prestigious multi-sport event.“Had an engaging discussion today with Darren Hall, Christian Napier (Director of AI, State of Utah), and senior IOA official Lt Gen Harpal Singh (retd) on the future of the Commonwealth Union,” Gujarat Minister of State for Sports Harsh Sanghavi posted on X. He said the talks revolved around collaboration, innovation, and strengthening global sporting ties.India’s bid has gained momentum since Canada withdrew from the race last month. While the initial expression of interest is in, the final bid proposal must be submitted by August 31.The host city will be announced in November during the General Assembly of Commonwealth Sport in Glasgow, UK.“The host selection will be based on sustainability, athletic excellence, and regional appeal.There also needs to be flexibility in terms of the host nation’s capabilities,” explained Lt Gen Singh, an IOA executive member and part of Commonwealth Sport’s Sports Committee.Over three days, the inspection team met with Gujarat government officials and toured multiple venues across Ahmedabad, assessing stadiums, training facilities, accommodation, and transport infrastructure.If successful, this would mark India’s second time hosting, after the 2010 Games in Delhi.","A high-level delegation from Commonwealth Sport completes a three-day inspection of Ahmedabad.

JHARGRAM: When 25-year-old Rajshree Hansda - the first Santhali woman to become a national football referee - walked up to CM Mamata Banerjee on the podium at Jhargram stadium to receive her sports kit on Thursday, she leaned forward to whisper something ""personal"" to the CM.Minutes later, Banerjee told the gathering that Rajshree had informed her that she loved football and wanted to pursue her career as a referee but was under pressure from her family to get married. The CM not only asked chief secretary Manoj Pant to ""help"" Rajshree but urged all parents to ""let their daughters shine"".""She told me that there was pressure on her to get married... People should not force daughters into marriage. Let them shine in life. Women today can be independent and run families, even the country.They fly planes and drive trains... In a survey that I conducted, I was proud to find out that my Kanyashree daughters (beneficiaries of Bengal govt scheme for girls) have became pilots, engineers or professors. They are working across the world with dignity. Please understand that they will make you, Bengal, and the country proud.You must realise that they are the spine of this society,"" Banerjee said.Rajshree lives in Gopiballavpur's Patulia with father Dama, mother Raymoni, two brothers and a sister.

""I am grateful to the CM that she heard me,"" Rajshree said.Addressing the gathering in Jhargram, the CM highlighted the social impact of Kanyashree, the one-time direct cash transfer scheme for girls in high school and colleges aimed at preventing school dropouts and stopping early marriages. ""We initiated Kanyashree in 2013 and it bagged first place in UN Public Service Award.At that time it was meant only for schoolgirls but then I requested parents to not force their daughters into marriage and encourage them to study. Kanyashree has now been extended to cover girls in schools, colleges and universities.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Montreal Canadiens may offer Lane Hutson a long-term extension close to Noah Dobson’s recent contract

32 Thoughts Podcast

“Lane Hutson, I’m sure initially the Canadiens wanted him to be under Suzuki; if Hutson’s gonna sign for term, it’s probably gonna be up closer to Dobson.”

Montreal Canadiens defenseman Lane Hutson earns big contract push after breakout 2024–25 NHL season

Contract talks between the Montreal Canadiens and rising defenseman Lane Hutson are reportedly gaining momentum and the financial framework may already be taking shape. According to insider Elliotte Friedman, Hutson could command a long-term extension that mirrors the recent deal signed by fellow Canadiens blueliner Noah Dobson, further cementing both as core pieces in Montreal’s future plans.Elliotte Friedman revealed on the latestthat if the Canadiens want to sign Lane Hutson to a long-term deal, they’ll likely need to pay a price similar to what it took to secure Noah Dobson. Friedman said,The Canadiens had reportedly hoped to keep Hutson’s average annual value (AAV) below that of captain Nick Suzuki ($7.875 million), but Friedman’s comments suggest the number will climb closer to Dobson’s recently signed eight-year, $76 million deal ($9.5 million AAV). Though not finalized, this indicates Montreal is willing to invest heavily in Hutson, who’s quickly proven himself as an elite puck-moving defenseman.Lane Hutson, 21, is coming off an impressive rookie campaign in which he posted 66 points in 82 games, exceptional production for a defenseman, followed by 5 points in 5 NHL playoff games. Selected 62nd overall in 2022, the 5-foot-9, 162-pound blueliner has rapidly outpaced expectations and emerged as one of the Canadiens’ most valuable young assets.Given Dobson’s own recent contract and similar age and profile, the comparison is more than fair. Hutson’s next deal could fall just short of Dobson’s AAV, potentially in the $9.25 million range over eight years, a projection that aligns with the rumors circulating in recent weeks.As Lane Hutson’s value continues to rise, the Canadiens seem poised to make a major long-term commitment. Elliotte Friedman’s insight confirms that Hutson’s next deal could mirror Noah Dobson’s, signaling how highly Montreal views their young star. With both blueliners likely locked in for the long haul, the Canadiens’ blue line is shaping up to be a strength for years to come.Also Read: NHL free agency 2025: Jack Roslovic still unsigned as Toronto Maple Leafs remain in the mix for top forward","Montreal Canadiens may offer Lane Hutson a long-term extension close to Noah Dobson’s recent contract.

TOI relives their saga and heroics

The plan takes shape in Lucknow

A symbol of Hindu-Muslim unity

The revolutionary legacy

The martyrs’ sacrifice

A hundred years ago, on Aug 9, 1925, a group of 10 young revolutionaries executed a daring plan that would echo through India’s freedom struggle, and beyond. The Kakori Train Action, a meticulously planned heist of a British railway treasury, was more than a robbery — it was a bold statement against colonial oppression and a testament to the unbreakable bond of HinduMuslim unity.Led by Pt Ram Prasad Bismil and his trusted comrade Ashfaqullah Khan, the Kakori Action not only challenged the British Raj but also inspired a generation to unite for freedom. As we commemorate its centenary, the story of Kakori remains a powerful symbol of courage, camaraderie, and the revolutionary spirit that fuelled India’s struggle for freedom.In the first week of Aug 1925, 10 young men checked into Chhedilal Dharamshala in Aminabad, Lucknow, their minds buzzing with a revolutionary plot. The group, part of the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), included Chandrashekhar Azad, Ram Prasad Bismil, Ashfaqullah Khan, Rajendranath Lahiri, Mukundilal, Murarilal, Kundanlal, Banwarilal, Bakshi, and Manmathnath Gupta.Their target: the 8 Down Saharanpur-Lucknow Passenger Train, which carried a treasury safe filled with railway collections — a symbol of British economic exploitation.On Aug 8, they conducted a final reconnaissance at Charbagh railway station, only to face a setback. As they reached Kakori station on foot, the train sped past, leaving them stunned. “A train in India could not be so regular,” one remarked in disbelief. They had missed it by 10 minutes. The misstep exposed their inexperience with such high-stakes operations. Bismil recognized the need for better synchronization. The team retreated to their base, recalibrated, and resolved to execute the plan the next day.On Aug 9, the revolutionaries took no chances and boarded the train at a previous station, splitting into two groups. Ashfaqullah Khan, Rajendranath Lahiri, and Bakshi secured second-class tickets, while Bismil, Azad, and the others spread out in third-class compartments.As the train approached Kakori, those in second class pulled the emergency chain, bringing the train to a halt. Chaos ensued, but the group was prepared. Wielding German Mauser pistols, they leapt into action.One member rushed to the engine to secure the driver, while another subdued the guard, forcing him to lie face-down. The group’s primary target was the heavy iron safe in the guard’s van, containing cash collections from stations along the route. Using a hammer and chisel, they began breaking it open, while others reassured passengers in Hindustani: “We are after govt property, not your lives. Stay inside and do not look out. ” Sporadic gunfire punctuated the air, ensuring compliance.The operation hit a snag when the safe resisted their tools. Ashfaqullah, a towering figure with unwavering resolve, handed his Mauser to young Manmathnath Gupta and took up the hammer himself, striking with full force. The distant rumble of another train — possibly the Punjab Mail — sent a chill through the group. Fearing a military response or betrayal, they braced for the worst.Bismil instructed them to conceal their weapons and lie low. The train passed without incident, and Ashfaq resumed his work, finally breaching the safe. The revolutionaries collected the cash in bags, bundled them in a bedsheet, and prepared to retreat. To mislead passengers, including British military officers on board, the group fled in a direction suggesting they were escaping away from Lucknow.Instead, they doubled back, entering the city through the bustling Chowk market. The cash and bonds were hidden in a safehouse known only to Bismil, while the weapons were stashed in prearranged locations. The group dispersed, some retreating to hideouts, others blending into public spaces like parks.By dawn, newspaper hawkers in Lucknow shouted headlines of the “Sensational Train Hold-Up at Kakori,” confirming the audacity and success of their mission.At the heart of the Kakori Train Action was the profound bond between Ram Prasad Bismil, an ardent Arya Samaj follower, and Ashfaqullah Khan, a devout Muslim. Their friendship and shared commitment to India’s freedom became a beacon of Hindu-Muslim unity, challenging colonial efforts to sow discord.Renowned historian and former head of Modern and Medieval History Department in University of Lucknow, Professor Aroop Chakraborty notes, “The Kakori Action sent ripples of unity across the nation. It showed that Hindus and Muslims could work as one for a common cause, directly countering the British narrative. In fact, the action also paved the way for the spirit of revolution across the country against the British Raj. ”In a poignant letter written days before his execution, Bismil urged Indians to embrace this unity. He cited Ashfaqullah as proof that Muslims were as committed to the nation’s freedom as anyone else. “If a staunch Muslim like Ashfaqullah can be my right hand, why can’t Hindus and Muslims unite for India’s freedom?” he wrote. Bismil’s words were echoed by Shaheede-Azam Bhagat Singh, who, under the pseudonym ‘Vidrohi’, wrote in the journal ‘Kirti’ in Jan 1928: “Bismil’s last request was for HinduMuslim unity. He and Ashfaqullah agreed that this was their greatest wish and the true memorial to their sacrifice.” The British, aware of the symbolic power of this alliance, tried to break it. They offered Bismil exile with an allowance and told Ashfaqullah that the HRA was a Hindu organization with no place for Muslims. Both rejected these divisive tactics, remaining steadfast in their shared vision.The Kakori Action had far-reaching consequences, reshaping India’s freedom struggle. The HRA, initially focused on establishing a federated republic through armed revolution, used the loot — about Rs 4,600 in cash and bonds — to settle debts, procure weapons, and relocate members to safer regions. This financial boost fortified the organization, enabling it to evolve into the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) in 1928 under Chandrashekhar Azad’s leadership.HSRA shifted its focus to economic self-reliance and mass mobilization. Bhagat Singh emphasized aligning with workers and peasants. Historian Sumit Sarkar notes that this period saw a “massive labour upsurge,” particularly in railways and textiles, which the HSRA sought to harness. The organization’s new objectives inspired socialist leaders within the Congress, influencing its trajectory into the post-independence era. The Kakori Action also forced the Congress to rethink its strategy. Bismil, a former Congress member who had worked with leaders like Bal Gangadhar Tilak, had long advocated for a broader, more inclusive movement. The heist’s audacity prompted the Congress to define “Swaraj” as “Poorna Swaraj” (complete independence) at its 1929 Lahore Convention.The British response to Kakori was swift and brutal. By 1927, Bismil, Ashfaqullah, Lahiri, and Roshan Singh were sentenced to death, while others faced imprisonment or transportation. Their trials exposed the colonial govt’s fear of the revolutionary movement’s growing influence. Yet, the martyrs’ sacrifice galvanized the youth, who saw in their bravery a call to action. Bismil and Ashfaqullah’s bond transcended religious divides, offering a model of solidarity that remains relevant today.","A century ago, a small group of bravehearts executed the Kakori Train Action, that gave a big push to the freedom struggle and etched their names in the history forever. The story of Kakori remains a powerful symbol of courage, camaraderie, and the revolutionary spirit that fuelled India’s struggle for freedom.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123179356,imgsize-1739081,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/123179356.jpg"

Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmark indices, tanked in trade on Friday as Donald Trump’s 50% tariffs on India and its likely impact on exports and economy hit sentiment. While Nifty50 went below 24,500, BSE Sensex was down 500 points. At 10:15 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 24,449.70, down 146 points or 0.60%. BSE Sensex was at 80,135.33, down 488 points or 0.61%.Market experts anticipate sideways trading, influenced by US-Russia diplomatic negotiations, India's stance on US tariffs and corporate earnings trends.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “The market continues to be technically and fundamentally weak. Continuous lower lows on the Nifty is technically a weak sign. From the fundamental perspective, there are no indications yet of a sharp uptick in earnings for FY26. These weak indicators, along with the relatively high valuations in India, are triggering sustained selling by the FIIs. FIIs have sold on all trading days of August, so far, taking their total cash market selling in August, till now, to Rs 15950 crores. Yesterday’s sharp 250 point recovery from the low level in Nifty was caused by short covering triggered by the strong buying by DIIs of Rs 10864 crores.In the present context of negative sentiments in the market caused by the tariff skirmishes between India and the US, FIIs are likely to continue selling in the cash market. The only saving grace is the sustained DII buying which remains strong. The strong DII buying assisted by sustained flows into mutual funds can prevent a crash in the market. Investors may wait and watch for the developments on the tariff front to unfold.""The Dow Jones and S&P 500 declined on Thursday, affected by Eli Lilly's share price drop following underwhelming results from its oral weight loss medication, whilst the Nasdaq achieved a new record at closing.Asian equities moved higher as trading commenced on Friday, heading towards their fifth straight day of gains, with Japanese markets benefiting from technology sector strength.Oil prices stayed relatively stable during early Asian trading on Friday, yet were on track for their largest weekly decline since late-June. Investors showed worries about the effects on the global economy from newly implemented tariffs that became effective on Thursday.Gold futures reached new highs on Friday after news emerged about the United States imposing tariffs on one-kilo gold bar imports. Spot gold was set to record its second consecutive weekly increase, influenced by tariff uncertainties and anticipated US interest rate reductions.Foreign portfolio investors executed net sales of shares valued at Rs 4,997 crore on Wednesday. In contrast, DIIs conducted net purchases amounting to Rs 10,864 crore.","Nifty50 and BSE Sensex tanked in trade on Friday as Donald Trump’s 50% tariffs on India and its likely impact on exports and economy hit sentiment.
