There can be harassment of people and we won’t permit that. If we find there is ambiguity in the provision, we will set it right. Second, people can’t be sent behind bars in all the cases,” the bench told additional solicitor general SV Raju, appearing for Centre.The bench sought the data after senior advocate Siddharth Luthra, appearing for some of the petitioners flagged the alleged misuse of the powers of the authorities under the GST regime, saying it is curtailing the liberty of individuals.During the hearing on Thursday, Luthra pointed out that sometimes arrests are not made, but people are “harassed” by issuing notices to them, threatening arrest. He highlighted that arrest under the GST Act is to be preceded by adjudication of the amount considered due and payable on the part of a taxpayer.Luthra said the question which needs to be considered is whether the liberty of an individual can be curtailed under section 69 until the assessment is made and amount is quantified.Raju said he will gather data regarding notices and arrests made under the central GST Act but such information relating to states would be difficult to collate. The bench said, “We want all the data. The GST Council will have those data. If the data is available, we want it before us,” the bench told Raju, adding there has to be a distinction between cases of fraud and inadvertent lapses.","The Supreme Court has asked Centre to furnish details of issuance of notices and arrests done under the provisions of the Goods and Services Tax.

Taking it as a test case, the ministry has now asked the state govt to initiate action against the PACS since these entities can't procure for or keep stocks of private players.“The state govt has been asked to take action against such entities. Govt has been trying hard to increase procurement from farmers to ensure they get the assured MSP,” an official told TOI.Due to the low wheat procurement in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, despite good production, Food Corporation of India transports the foodgrain from Punjab and Haryana for distribution in these two states, which costs more.While the low priority accorded by the Bihar govt is one of the key causes for low procurement, the land holdings are also smaller than Punjab and Haryana, leaving little surplus for farmers beyond their own consumption.During the current procurement season, 7,280 tonne of wheat has been purchased in Bihar by PACS so far against the target of 2 lakh tonne for the season.

Here are the key reasons that led to today's bloodbath:

Stock market crash today: BSE Sensex and Nifty50 , the Indian equity benchmark indices, tanked in trade on Friday, despite a strong opening and the Nifty reaching a new all-time high. Selling pressure from index heavyweights Reliance Industries (RIL) and HDFC Bank led to the crash on Dalal Street . The S&P BSE Sensex dropped by 1,126 points or 1.5% to reach a low of 73,627.99, and the broader Nifty 50 fell by 289 points to touch a low of 22,358.65.All sectoral indices experienced declines in trading.BSE Sensex closed the day at 73,878.15, down 733 points or 0.98%. Nifty50 ended the day at 22,475.85, down 172 points or 0.76%. The market capitalization of companies listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange also decreased significantly by Rs 4.25 lakh crore when Sensex tanked 1,100 points.The fear gauge India VIX also increased by 11% to nearly 15, marking its 7th consecutive rise.""I feel geopolitical tension would make headlines again giving traders an option to go short on markets. Overall, the Q4 earnings are ranging from neutral to positive and are not particularly impressive. There are some reports indicating that Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) have decreased their holdings in large-cap stocks such as HDFC Bank and ITC. In the short term, the trend remains cautious, with the focus shifting towards new geopolitical developments. Hence, we advise traders to remain light on positions,"" said Prashanth Tapse of Mehta Equities.1. RIL and HDFC Banks led the market downfall. The Indian markets lost their morning gains and dropped to the day's low due to the decline in RIL, L&T, HDFC Bank, and Bharti Airtel, among others. These stocks had the most significant impact on the headline indices in terms of their contribution to the respective indices.2. India VIX, which is a measure of volatility, increased by more than 12% to 15.12 due to various factors affecting market sentiments such as Q4 earnings, the ongoing election season, and the delay in the US Fed's interest rate cut.Commenting on the day's action, Amit Goel, Co-Founder & Chief Global Strategist, Pace 360 said that the volatility of the Indian stock market has increased in the last few weeks owing to a combination of both global and domestic factors.""Globally, speculation surrounding the timing and magnitude of the season's first Fed rate cut, along with selling pressure from FIIs in emerging markets, plays a pivotal role. The NFP data from the US expected later today is also a factor in today's volatility,"" Goel added.3. In its policy for May, the Federal Reserve recognized that there has been limited advancement towards achieving its inflation target and emphasized the uncertainty surrounding the inflation trajectory. Markets expect US interest rates to stay higher for longer and are pricing in just one rate cut in 2024, said Rajani Sinha, Chief Economist, CareEdge Ratings. The non-farm payroll data from the United States that is anticipated later today is also contributing to the volatility seen today.4. Higher-for-longer interest rates. The inflation trajectory in the US has delayed the timing and magnitude of the season's first Fed rate cut. Investors are now starting to question if the Fed will be able to implement any rate cuts at all in the year 2024 due to the recent disappointing progress in reducing inflation.5. Market speculations related to the outcome of the Lok Sabha election results are also causing increased volatility. Analysts predict that volatility may increase even more as we approach the election results date of 4th June.","BSE Sensex and Nifty50 tanked in trade on Friday.

Read Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella’s memo to employees on “prioritising security above all else”,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/read-microsoft-ceo-satya-nadellas-memo-to-employees-on-prioritising-security-above-all-else/articleshow/109824556.cms,"Read Nadella’s full memo below:



Today, I want to talk about something critical to our company’s future: prioritizing security above all else.

Microsoft runs on trust, and our success depends on earning and maintaining it. We have a unique opportunity and responsibility to build the most secure and trusted platform that the world innovates upon.

The recent findings by the Department of Homeland Security’s

Cyber Safety Review Board

(CSRB) regarding the Storm-0558 cyberattack, from summer 2023, underscore the severity of the threats facing our company and our customers, as well as our responsibility to defend against these increasingly sophisticated threat actors.

Last November, we launched our Secure Future Initiative (SFI) with this responsibility in mind, bringing together every part of the company to advance cybersecurity protection across both new products and legacy infrastructure. I’m proud of this initiative, and grateful for the work that has gone into implementing it. But we must and will do more.

Going forward, we will commit the entirety of our organization to SFI, as we double down on this initiative with an approach grounded in three core principles:

• Secure by Design: Security comes first when designing any product or service.

• Secure by Default: Security protections are enabled and enforced by default, require no extra effort, and are not optional.

• Secure Operations: Security controls and monitoring will continuously be improved to meet current and future threats.

These principles will govern every facet of our SFI pillars as we: Protect Identities and Secrets, Protect Tenants and Isolate Production Systems, Protect Networks, Protect Engineering Systems, Monitor and Detect Threats, and Accelerate Response and Remediation. We’ve shared specific, company-wide actions each of these pillars will entail - including those recommended in the CSRB’s report which you can learn about here. Across Microsoft, we will mobilize to implement and operationalize these standards, guidelines, and requirements and this will be an added dimension of our hiring and rewards decisions. In addition, we will instill accountability by basing part of the compensation of the senior leadership team on our progress towards meeting our security plans and milestones.

We must approach this challenge with both technical and operational rigor, and with a focus on continuous improvement. Every task we take on - from a line of code, to a customer or partner process – is an opportunity to help bolster our own security and that of our entire ecosystem. This includes learning from our adversaries and the increasing sophistication of their capabilities, as we did with Midnight Blizzard. And learning from the trillions of unique signals we’re constantly monitoring to strengthen our overall posture. It also includes stronger, more structured collaboration across the public and private sector.

Security is a team sport, and accelerating SFI isn’t just job number one for our security teams — it’s everyone’s top priority and our customers’ greatest need.

If you’re faced with the tradeoff between security and another priority, your answer is clear: Do security. In some cases, this will mean prioritizing security above other things we do, such as releasing new features or providing ongoing support for legacy systems. This is key to advancing both our platform quality and capability such that we can protect the digital estates of our customers and build a safer world for all.

Microsoft products have been hit by various high-profile hacking attempts which, in addition to the years of security issues, has put the company in a spot. Multiple reports in the last few weeks have suggested that the leadership in the company is now prioritising security and overhauling its security processes. The company CEO Satya Nadella has now outlined this in a memo sent to more than 200,000 employees.This comes a few days after Nadella said in the latest quarterly earning call with investors that Microsoft is prioritising security above new products and services. He sheds light on how the company is learning from attackers to improve its security processes, and that the employees must not make security tradeoffs.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has outlined the company's new security priorities in a memo sent to more than 200,000 employees.

‘Make UT a city state’: Tewari roots for new administrative structure,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/make-ut-a-city-state-tewari-roots-for-new-administrative-structure/articleshow/109830607.cms,"CHANDIGARH:Terming the current governance and administrative structure in Chandigarh as a “nightmare”, Congress candidate for the Chandigarh Lok Sabha seat Manish Tewari said, “Chandigarh needs a new administrative structure. It needs to be reimagined.”In an interaction with TOI here on Wednesday, Tewari said it would be his topmost priority to see that the city gets a proper legal architecture and a governance structure, which is futuristic and explores the potential of the city.Problems that have been languishing for the past two decades, like regularization, need-based changes, ban on share-wise property sales etc, said Tewari, “Stem from a fundamental problem of outdated governance structure, which is not geared to serve the city 58 years down the line.”Talking about the inception of the city’s governance and administrative system, Tewari said, “The fundamental problem is that the administrative structure of Chandigarh was designed for an ad hoc period of five years. Chandigarh became a union territory on Jan 1, 1966. The administrative structure which was in play was an interim arrangement. It was supposed to lapse in 1971. Now, that has got perpetuated into perpetuity. You have a situation whereby Chandigarh can move from a union territory to a city state .”Tewari said there is a mishmash of legislations that govern the city, like Periphery Act, Punjab Capital Development Regulation Act and others which have not been updated as per the city’s evolving requirements.“Then there is a multiplicity of administrators. It begins with the home minister, then there is a governor, followed by the adviser, MP and municipal corporation,” said Tewari.‘Make plans for next 25 yrs’Tewari said: “The whole administrative structure must be streamlined, and it must be made peoplefriendly by ensuring that there is a comprehensive omnibus legislation, which takes all aspects into consideration and looks at the overall governance of Chandigarh.”Recommending a longterm perspective for developing the city’s new governance system, Tewari said, “See, essentially, when you look at a city or when you look at a state, you don't look at it in a fiveyear perspective. You look at it over a 25-year period horizon. So, when you plan for any state or any city, you plan for the next 25 years.”“Be it genomics, artificial intelligence or robotics, Chandigarh has an enormous potential to leverage the fourth industrial revolution. Why is it that Mohali or even Panchkula is doing better than Chandigarh? That is primarily because the ecosystem which can energize the fourth industrial revolution just doesn’t exist here,” the Congress nominee said.So, when you design a legislative or a legal architecture, the fundamental purpose is threefold — it should generate employment for the young, it should be people friendly in terms of access to services and caters to the needs of the senior citizens, which is growing by the day, Tewari said.",Manish Tewari is the Congress candidate for the Chandigarh Lok Sabha seat.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

Amazon and Google suspend US green card applications for immigrants amid tech layoffs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/amazon-and-google-suspend-us-green-card-applications-for-immigrants-amid-tech-layoffs/articleshow/109815272.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amazon and Google have halted US green card applications for immigrants for the year 2024, a decision made against the backdrop of recent tech industry layoffs , including those at Microsoft. The intensifying competition is making conditions increasingly challenging for foreign workers, the Daily Guardian reported.The suspension of the green card application process may exacerbate the difficulties faced by overseas candidates seeking employment in the US, particularly within the tech sector.Both Amazon and Google have paused PERM applications until the following year.PERM, administered by the US Department of Labor, is a procedure aimed at securing permanent labor certification. Its primary objective is to safeguard job opportunities, wages, and working conditions for American workers while admitting foreign workers. Often, PERM serves as the initial stage in the green card acquisition process.Amazon made an internal announcement earlier this year stating its decision to halt all PERM filings through 2024 due to operational constraints. Google similarly suspended its PERM applications in January 2023, coinciding with the layoff of 12,000 employees. Employees were informed that the PERM process would not resume until the first quarter of 2025.Ava Benach, founding partner of Benach Collopy, a distinguished immigration law firm in Washington DC, commented that tech companies are following Google's strategy due to its significant influence in the industry.Collopy said that, “With more US workers available for open positions, the labor market test fails and so the process becomes a waste of time and money for these tech companies.” Collopy explained.“If tech companies have done layoffs relatively recently, they also have to notify laid off workers of new positions that may be going to foreign workers. If some of these people say ‘yes, I’m interested,’ then you’re out of luck with the green card application,” she added, according to the Daily Guardian.","Both Amazon and Google have paused PERM applications until the following year.

Biden expands health insurance access for DACA immigrants,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-expands-health-insurance-access-for-daca-immigrants/articleshow/109812287.cms,"WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden 's administration will allow certain immigrants illegally brought to the US as children greater access to federally run health insurance , the White House said on Friday, addressing a sensitive issue ahead of elections in November.With the move, an estimated 100,000 previously uninsured participants in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, are expected to enroll in the Health Insurance Marketplace and Basic Health Program, both created under the Affordable Care Act, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said.The DACA program was launched in 2012 under former President Barack Obama, to whom Biden was vice president. The program offers deportation relief and work permits to so-called ""Dreamer"" immigrants who were illegally brought to the US as children or overstayed a visa."" Dreamers are our loved ones, our nurses, teachers, and small business owners,"" Biden said in a statement. ""And they deserve the promise of health care just like all of us.""DACA enrollees will have access to related financial assistance, such as tax credits and reduced out-of-pocket costs under the change, which will be effective Nov. 1, according to a White House fact sheet.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about any costs to the US government.Immigration has emerged as a top issue for voters ahead of the US presidential election in November pitting Biden, a Democrat, against Republican former President Donald Trump. Biden has sought to balance a tougher approach to border security with policies that protect asylum seekers and others in the US illegally.Trump, an immigration hardliner, tried to end DACA during his presidency but was denied by the US Supreme Court. About 530,000 people are currently enrolled in the program, which remains subject to an ongoing legal fight.HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra said on Thursday that people without health care insurance delay preventative or routine medical care, leading to unnecessary costs later.The regulation will give DACA participants access to the Basic Health Program, which serves low-income residents, according to a White House fact sheet.The change will not open access to two other low-income programs, Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, as was initially proposed in 2023.","US President Joe Biden's administration will allow certain immigrants greater access to federally run health insurance.

The damage isn't stopping the presses,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/a-tornado-hit-an-oklahoma-newsroom-built-in-the-1920s-the-damage-isnt-stopping-the-presses/articleshow/109805263.cms,"SULPHUR: When Oklahoma and national officials held a press conference Monday to discuss the scale of devastation following tornadoes two days earlier, Kathy John did what she always does: She showed up to report on it for the town's weekly newspaper, the Sulphur Times-Democrat.But before she could write her story, John had to help her staff salvage computers from the newsroom , which was at the center of the path of destruction on April 28.""We're gonna get a paper out. It may be a day late, but we're gonna get a paper out,"" John said from in front of the brick building built in 1926 that houses the newsroom.Sulphur suffered Oklahoma's worst destruction during an outreak of severe weather when a tornado plowed through downtown in the community of about 5,000 residents south of Oklahoma City. Four people were killed across the state, including a woman who was in a bar near the newspaper's offices.Kathy John's husband, James John, joined the staff in 1968, after his father ran it for 27 years. Together, the pair have been covering Sulphur, the county seat, for more than 50 years.In the 83 years their family has owned the paper, it has never missed a printing, Kathy John said. It has come close before.There was the time about 20 years ago when an overnight freeze followed torrential rains that caused trees and power lines to snap in two. Some residents were without power for weeks, but running on a generator, the newsroom of the Sulphur Times Democrat continued to churn.But this week has tested the paper's staff of three.""I've been trying to write a headline all day, but you just can't put into words what happened,"" James John said, looking at the paper's layout on a computer on his kitchen table.Their newsroom downtown is without power, so the Oklahoma Press Association delivered a wifi hotspot and other equipment to help the staff put out the paper from the John's home a few blocks away, where they rode out the storm and thankfully took no damage.The newsroom was built in 1926, the same year the newspaper started printing, and they're likely the original tenants, although no one can say for certain. The building was once a fallout shelter and might be one of the few buildings that will survive. But they worry the town may condemn the structure and raze it with the rest of downtown, James John said.Several buildings have completely crumpled. Others show the strange precision of tornadic winds, like a shop that is missing its front wall while the clothing inside remains neatly folded or hanging on a rack.Not far from the newsroom, a sports grill was flattened underneath its roof. One resident, Sheila Hilliard Goodman, died there Saturday night while sheltering from the tornado.Brick, wood and metal rubble has been pushed to the curbs and maintenance trucks line most of the downtown's modest five blocks, where disaster relief workers attend to downed power lines or sweep debris from the few remaining rooftops. Business owners and their families salvage what they can by loading truck beds and trailers.Some of the buildings in Sulphur's downtown predate statehood in 1907, and it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The town is built on tourism for Chickasaw National Recreation Area, a nearly 10,000-acre (4,046.86-hectare) park across the street with natural springs that travelers once believed had medicinal qualities.Visitors often compare the smell of the sulfurous water in the springs to rotten eggs. But on Monday, the rich smell of leather hung in the air, wafting down the block through the busted windows of Billy Cook Harness & Saddle.Sulphur is crawling with reporters from all over the state and country, so the newspaper staff decided they could serve their community best by writing about its strength and resiliency.""This week we're trying to focus on all the people here helping and the helpers and how blessed we are that we only had one fatality,"" Kathy John said. ""I just think it's the most integral thing to do.""By Tuesday, the Johns had decided to publish the newspaper on Thursday, one day later than usual. The paper is printed in a nearby town that wasn't hit by the tornado.It had been a tough few days and their heads were still spinning while trying to keep up with the location of the next FEMA press conference or whether the city would let them back into their building to retrieve their archives.As the recovery continued around them, James John was still working on writing that headline.""It was a treasure,"" he said of the old downtown, thinking perhaps that was the angle. ""Something along that line, you know: 'Treasure Lost.'""","Sulphur suffered Oklahoma's worst destruction during an outreak of severe weather.

It had given one month to these retailers to voluntarily register with the tax machinery, a deadline that lapsed Tuesday.Till the last date, only 75 retailers got registered with the FBR, officials said.

IMF approves last tranche of $3-billion loan to Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imf-approves-last-tranche-of-3-billion-loan-to-pakistan/articleshow/109738150.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif expressed optimism Tuesday regarding release of IMF ’s final $1.1 billion tranche of a $3 billion bailout to the country, saying it would bolster economic stability . Pakistan is now eyeing a new, longer and larger economic bailout package, but economists cautioned against the country’s continued reliance on overseas financial assistance, warning of potential dire consequences.IMF approved the immediate release of the tranche following a key meeting of the global lender’s executive board in Washington late Monday night.All board members favoured releasing the funds, except India, which abstained.Pakistan has been reeling from a severe economic crisis for more than two years, with its inflation at one point shooting up to nearly 38% and its foreign currency reserves depleted to $3bn in Feb 2023, enough to cover less than five weeks of imports.Last year, the global lender had approved a nine-month standby arrangement with Pakistan “to support its economic stabilisation programme”. The approval had allowed for an immediate disbursement of $1.2bn, with the rest phased over the programme’s duration — subject to two quarterly reviews.The IMF bailout proved important to save the country from default, the state broadcaster quoted PM Sharif as saying.Leading economist Qaiser Bengali expressed scepticism about the perceived stability, highlighting the temporary nature of the current situation and underscoring the necessity of meaningful reforms to address long-term economic challenges.“If the so-called stability was due to a rise in exports or better inflow of dollars, that would have been meaningful, but that is not happening,” Bengali said, adding that the economy cannot run on a policy of getting new loans to pay past loans.Pakistan’s external debt obligations exceed $130 billion, with concerns raised by financial experts regarding the potential inflationary impact of the country’s debt-driven approach to fiscal deficit management.","PM Shehbaz Sharif expressed optimism regarding release of IMF ’s final $1.1 billion tranche of a $3 billion bailout to the country.

From spring offensive to charm offensive: The Taliban are working to woo tourists to Afghanistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/from-spring-offensive-to-charm-offensive-the-taliban-are-working-to-woo-tourists-to-afghanistan/articleshow/109713887.cms,"KABUL: Around 30 men are crammed into a Kabul classroom, part of the debut student cohort at a Taliban-run institute training tourism and hospitality professionals.It's a motley crew. One student is a model. Another is 17 and has no job history.The students vary in age, education level and professional experience. They're all men - Afghan women are banned from studying beyond sixth grade - and they don't know anything about tourism or hospitality.But they are all eager to promote a different side of Afghanistan . And the Taliban are happy to help.Afghanistan's rulers are pariahs on the global stage, largely because of their restrictions on women and girls. The economy is struggling, infrastructure is poor, and poverty is rife.And yet, foreigners are visiting the country, encouraged by the sharp drop in violence, increased flight connections with hubs like Dubai, and the bragging rights that come with vacationing in an unusual destination. The numbers aren't huge - they never were - but there's a buzz around Afghan tourism.In 2021, there were 691 foreign tourists . In 2022, that figure rose to 2,300. Last year, there were 7,000.Mohammad Saeed, the head of the Tourism Directorate in Kabul, said the biggest foreign visitor market is China because of its proximity and large population. Afghanistan also has advantages over some of its neighbors.""They've told me they don't want to go to Pakistan because it's dangerous and they get attacked. The Japanese have said this to me also,"" Saeed said. ""This is good for us.""But there are disadvantages, too.Visas are difficult and expensive to access. Many countries severed ties with Afghanistan after the Taliban returned to power, and no country recognizes them as the legitimate rulers of the country.Afghan embassies either closed or suspended their operations. There's an ongoing power struggle between Afghanistan's embassies and consulates staffed by people from the former Western-backed administration, and those under the Taliban administration's full control.Saeed concedes there are obstacles for Afghan tourism to develop but said he was working with ministries to overcome them.His ultimate aim is to have a visa on arrival for tourists, but that could be years away. There are problems with the road network, which is half-paved or non-existent in some parts of the country, and airlines largely avoid Afghan airspace.The capital Kabul has the most international flights, but no Afghan airport has direct routes with major tourist markets like China, Europe, or India.Despite the challenges, Saeed wants Afghanistan to become a tourism powerhouse, an ambition that appears to be backed by the Taliban's top leaders.""I have been sent to this department on the instructions of the elders (ministers). They must trust me because they've sent me to this important place.""The students also have aspirations. The model, Ahmed Massoud Talash, wants to learn about Afghanistan's picturesque spots for Instagram posts and its history for media appearances.Business school graduate Samir Ahmadzai wants to open a hotel but thinks he should know more about tourism and hospitality first.""They hear that Afghanistan is backwards, poverty and all about war,"" said Ahmadzai. ""We have 5,000 years of history. There should be a new page of Afghanistan.""Classes include Afghan handicrafts and anthropology basics.An unofficial subject is how to interact with foreign women and how their behavior or habits could clash with local customs and edicts. Examples might be women smoking or eating in public, to mixing freely with men who are not related to them by blood or marriage.The Taliban have imposed a dress code for women and requirements for them to have a male guardian, or mahram, when they travel. Dining alone, traveling alone, and socializing with other women in public have become harder. With gyms closed to women and beauty salons banned, there are fewer places where they can meet outside the home.In a sign that the country is preparing for more overseas visitors, the country's only five-star hotel, the Serena, has reopened its women's spa and salon for foreign females after a monthslong closure.Foreigners must show their passport to access services. Women with ""born in Afghanistan"" on their ID are barred.The restrictions on Afghan women and girls weigh on overseas travel companies, who say they try to focus on the positive aspect of cultural interactions by making donations, supporting local projects or only visiting family-run businesses.Shane Horan, the founder of Rocky Road Travel, said visiting Afghanistan should not be seen as an endorsement of any particular government or political regime.""Ultimately, the goal should be to support responsible tourism practices that contribute positively to the local economy and foster mutual respect and understanding, while also remaining cognizant of the broader political context in Afghanistan.""He said there was no input from authorities about what tour groups saw or did, and that the company worked closely with a women's rights organization in Afghanistan. A percentage of the tour cost went into supporting this organization's programs, Horan added.There are no women at the Institute of Tourism & Hotel Management. The students don't mention it. But an official at the Tourism Directorate does.""It's a heartbreaking situation,"" said the official, who wished to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals. ""Even female family members ask if they can study here. But there was a change in policy with the change in government. The women who were studying before (the takeover) never came back. They never graduated.""","Afghanistan's rulers are pariahs on the global stage, largely because of their restrictions on women and girls.

UK PM Rishi Sunak under pressure amid dire local election results for his party,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-pm-rishi-sunak-under-pressure-amid-dire-local-election-results-for-his-party/articleshow/109822902.cms,"LONDON: British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's leadership is under severe pressure on Friday as the results of local elections and a crucial by-election poured in overnight, delivering what is being characterised as one of the worst poll outcomes for the governing Conservative Party in 40 years. In a sliver of hope, Tory Mayor Ben Houchen was re-elected for a third term in Tees Valley and gave his party leader something to cheer about amid results Sunak admitted have been ""disappointing"".But rebels from within his party are expected to renew their attacks on the British Indian leader after the Opposition Labour Party made definitive gains, including overturning the Tory majority in the Blackpool South by-election which was necessitated following a resignation amid a lobbying row. Labour Leader Sir Keir Starmer declared the result as a ""seismic"" victory and an overall poll verdict in favour of the party as it comes on the eve of a general election, expected later this year.""Blackpool speaks for the whole country...This is the one contest where voters had the chance to send a message to Rishi Sunak's Conservatives directly, and that message is an overwhelming vote for change,"" said Starmer of the by-election.""The message to Rishi Sunak is clear. It's time for change, it's time for a general election,"" he said.The Labour candidate in Blackpool South, Chris Webb, defeated Conservative David Jones in the constituency which the Tories had won from Labour under former prime minister Boris Johnson in 2019. The swing of 26 per cent from the Tories to Labour has been characterised as the third biggest in a by-election since 1945.""We're probably looking at certainly one of the worst, if not the worst, Conservative performance in local government elections for the last 40 years,"" eminent pollster Professor John Curtice told the BBC.The by-election took place alongside local elections around England and Wales, in which voters elected their local councillors who manage day to day issues such as waste collection, roads and local infrastructure as well as crime fighting.""I know that come with the general election they're (voters) going to stick with us because they don't want to be taken for granted. They know that it's you and the Conservatives that are building a brighter future for Teesside and a brighter future for Britain,"" said Sunak as he joined the victorious Mayor Ben Houchen in Tees Valley, northern England.The results will continue to pour in over the weekend, with the overall picture expected to be clear by Sunday. But the early indications are that Labour has taken control of a number of local authorities in the regions that had turned away from the party in favour of the Tories over its anti-Brexit stance.Meanwhile, Tories look set to lose hundreds of seats, with the far-right Reform UK also making some impact. This will also worry the Conservatives for the general election if traditional Tory voters are seen to be drawn to this new avatar of the pro-Brexit UK Independence Party (UKIP). In another trend likely to continue to resonate during a general election, there is evidence in areas with a significant Muslim population that Labour's stance to not strongly condemn Israel in the Gaza conflict is hurting the party.Most of the mayoral results are expected over the weekend, with London's Labour Mayor Sadiq Khan hoping to be re-elected for a third term. He was challenged by British Indian businessman Tarun Ghulati, who thanked voters for the support he received in the campaign.""I had overwhelming support from India and all over the world and want to thank everyone for the support and blessings,"" he said.Among the other mayoral polls, the Tory Mayor of the West Midlands is hoping to hold on to his seats. There other mayoral contests taking place include Greater Manchester and Liverpool City Region, with the East Midlands, the North East, and York and North Yorkshire electing mayors for the first time. Besides councillors and mayors, around 37 police and crime commissioners are also being elected in some parts of England and Wales.","British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's leadership is under severe pressure. Results of local elections and a crucial by-election poured in overnight. Opposition Labour Party made definitive gains, including overturning the Tory majority in Blackpool South. Labour Leader Sir Keir Starmer declared the result as a ""seismic"" victory and an overall poll verdict in favour of the party.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109822943,imgsize-664562,width-400,resizemode-4/109822943.jpg"

NEW DELHI: UK's Prince William and his wife Kate Middleton on Thursday released a photo of their daughter Charlotte to celebrate her ninth birthday .The photograph, taken in the last few days by her mother, the Princess of Wales, shows Charlotte, the couple's second child, smiling happily in the garden of their home in Windsor.In a post on X, the couple said, ""Happy 9th Birthday, Princess Charlotte ! Thank you for all of the kind messages today.""Kensington Palace has established a tradition of releasing photographs taken by Kate to commemorate birthdays and other family events.However, a picture issued earlier this year on Mother's Day in March was retracted by several news organisations due to editing, something for which Kate later apologised.This incident happened shortly before the princess disclosed that she was undergoing preventive chemotherapy after tests following major abdominal surgery in January that revealed the presence of cancer.The heir to the throne, William, resumed official duties last month, but Kate will only return to the public eye when her medical team confirms she is well enough. King Charles returned to public engagements this week for the first time since being diagnosed with cancer in February.Last month, the couple also released a photograph of their youngest child, Prince Louis, to mark his sixth birthday. The image taken by Kate, showed Louis lying on his stomach on the grass in a close-up shot.","UK's Prince William and his wife Kate Middleton released a photo of their daughter Charlotte to celebrate her ninth birthday.

Birmingham faces economic collapse amid record bankruptcy filings,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/birmingham-faces-economic-collapse-amid-record-bankruptcy-filings/articleshow/109781245.cms,"NEW DELHI: The city of Birmingham , once heralded as a beacon of municipal excellence, now grapples with severe financial distress , leading to drastic public service cuts and asset sales. This crisis emerged after the city declared bankruptcy last September due to its inability to balance its budget, resulting in a ""section 114"" notice, which is effectively a declaration of bankruptcy for local governments.Historically celebrated for its governance, Birmingham's current predicament is a stark contrast to its past.In 1890, Julian Ralph, an American journalist, extolled Birmingham as “the best-governed city in the world.” Yet today, the city council plans to close 25 libraries, end free swimming pool access, and has even considered selling its art galleries to mitigate financial strains. The once frequent waste collection will now occur fortnightly, and streetlights have been dimmed to cut costs, a CNN report said.The city's financial woes are compounded by historical mismanagement, including a failure to ensure equal pay across genders, resulting in significant compensation costs. Additionally, an IT system debacle has contributed to a financial deficit amounting to roughly £1 billion ($1.25 billion). Funding cuts from the central government, amounting to another £1 billion over the last decade, have further strained the city's finances, exacerbating the demand for services amidst shrinking budgets.Local historian Carl Chinn described the situation as a failure of the city to prioritize essential services, likening the city’s austerity measures to ""iron bars slammed shut on all our imaginings."" The city’s response includes selling over £1 billion in assets and a 21% hike in council tax, with the intent to generate £300 million in savings over two years. However, these measures have sparked significant local opposition.Kate Taylor, a local schoolteacher and leader of the ""Brum, Rise Up!"" campaign, expressed the community's frustration, stating, ""These cuts are not just going to be hard, they’re going to devastate the city.” Her campaign group, consisting of youth and social workers, musicians, and trade unionists, reflects a broad swath of community members impacted by the budgetary decisions, the CNN report said.The dire financial circumstances have also led to protests at the Birmingham and Midland Institute, where residents gathered to voice their concerns over the deep cuts to public services. Speaker after speaker detailed how the cuts would strip the city of its cultural and social fabric, impacting everything from mental health services for youth to access to cultural spaces.As England faces a wave of local government financial crises, Birmingham’s situation may be a harbinger of a larger national catastrophe. The upcoming local elections may reflect the public's response to these challenges, with potential implications for the ruling Conservative Party.","The city of Birmingham, once heralded as a beacon of municipal excellence, now grapples with severe financial distress.
