Madan Mohan

During His Lifetime, But The Decades Have Burnished The Legacy Of The

Composer

Whose Birth Centenary Is On June 25

Unsung star

Ghazal maestro

Man of principles

Some songs have afterlives. They are reborn in other languages, repurposed as jingles and cover versions, discovered and nurtured by new generations and geographies. Madan Mohan’s haunting composition, ‘ Lag Jaa Gale ’, a brew of melody and melancholy, belongs to that elite club of single malt songs.Here are the facts: the classic from ‘Woh Kaun Thi?’ (1964) was reused in a bunch of films, notably as ‘Ponmeni Thazhuvaamal’ — lensed on a teenage Jayalalitha in the 1966 Tamil film, ‘Yaar Nee?’ — and, more recently, in ‘Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster 3’ (2018). Several Pakistani singers have crooned it; there’s a qawwali version, too. The track was used to promote digital audio player, Saregama Carvaan. No wonder, the song, written by Raja Mehdi Ali Khan and voiced by Lata Mangeshkar, has over 300 million YouTube hits.And here’s the irony: ‘Lag Jaa Gale’ didn’t figure among the top 32 songs of 1964 in Binaca Geetmala’s annual hit parade even though two other numbers from the same film — ‘Jo humne dastan apni sunayee’ and ‘Naina barse rimjhim rimjhim’ — made it to the coveted chart.Lag Jaa Gale’s fate is emblematic of Baghdad-born music director Madan Mohan’s chequered career, which brims with moody melodies that have stood the test of time and changing taste but that seldom became chartbusters or won awards. In a career spanning 25 years, the composer didn’t take home a single Filmfare statuette.Only three of his songs figured in Geetmala’s Top 5 hits of the year. The frisky ‘Ae dil mujhe bata de’ (No.5 spot, film: ‘Bhai Bhai,’ 1956), the folksy and dancey, ‘Jhumka gira re’ (No.4, ‘Mera Saaya’, 1966), which was recast in Karan Johar’s ‘Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani’ (2023), and 1977’s ‘Koi pathar se na maare mere deewane ko’ (No.1, ‘Laila Majnu’). Tragically, the music director had breathed his last a couple of years before that. He was only 51.His eldest son Sanjeev Kohli writes that the lack of mass adulation always caused him anguish and, over the years, embittered him. “The man who was acknowledged as a genius by people who understood and appreciated music was never at the top rung in the hit parades or with the big banners or the big stars,” he says in the website, madanmohan.in.With exceptions like Madras-based production house AVM and filmmakers like Chetan Anand and Raj Khosla, Madan Mohan mostly scored music for smaller producers and directors. He worked for Devendra Goel (who gave him his break with ‘Ankhen’ in 1950), Shakti Samanta and Pramod Chakravarty, too, but that was much before they became industry biggies.The songs he composed were invariably better than the movies they were located in. Often, they are the only notable element of a film. Some of his finest work, ‘Dekh Kabira Roya’ (1958), ‘Jahan Ara’ (1964), ‘Dulhan Ek Raat Ki’ (inspired by Thomas Hardy’s ‘Tess of the d’Urbervilles’ (1967), was for movies that were mega flops. The songs are remembered, not because of the movie, but despite its failure.There is a timelessness and universality to his compositions, says film music historian Pavan Jha. Veer Zaara’s tunes were used about 30 years after his death, but they don’t sound outdated at all, he says.Nobody composed ghazals better in Hindi films. The music director with leading man looks had the gift to imbue songs with subterranean sadness even when the words were not overtly so, notably in ‘Aapki nazron ne samjha’ (‘Anpadh’, 1962), ‘Teri aankon ke siva duniya mein’ (‘Chirag’, 1969) and Dil dhoondta hai (‘Mausam’, 1975).Jha reasons that unlike some of the more popular music directors, Madan Mohan understood and appreciated Urdu poetry. He sang as well. “Which is why there’s a special symmetry of words and melody in his compositions,” he says. His niece, actor Anju Mahendroo, reinforces the point. “He wasn’t formally trained in music. But he was blessed with inborn talent. His music came from his heart,” she says.He was also a master of the mega song, best illustrat ed in ‘Tum jo mil gaye ho’ (‘Hanste Zakhm’, 1973) and ‘Har koi chahta hai’ (‘Ek Mutthi Aasman’, 1973). Like Vivaldi’s Four Seasons, these ambitious tracks change tempo, evoking a multitude of yearnings. He was versatile, too. Few patriotic pieces are as moving as ‘Kar chale hum fida jaan-o-tan saathiyon’ (‘Haqeeqat’, 1964). And, you’d seldom have heard a more joyful track than ‘Zaroorat hai zaroorat hai’ (‘Man-Mauji’, 1962).Songwriter-singer Amitabh Bhattacharya stumbled upon a Madan Mohan track from the unreleased film, ‘Jahan Tum Wahan Hum’. “Over the days, I kept returning to it and I think it underlines the strength and class of the composer who is making us listen to his song in an era where everything is fleeting and clutter rules our audio universe,” he says. The song goes, ‘Kaise kategi zindagi tere bagair’.In 1970, Madan Mohan won the national award for best music director for ‘Dastak’. Writer-director Rajinder Singh Bedi’s movie had some of the composer’s most poignant and sensitive melodies like ‘Baiyan na dharo’ to ‘Hum-hain-mataae-koocha’ and ‘Mayee ree’. “He was extremely sensitive. During a song recording of ‘Hanste Zakhm’, he was so moved by a note of a sitar that he started weeping profusely,” recalls Mahendroo.He was also a man of conviction and principles, a trait he shared with fellow composers such as Jaidev and Khayyam. “While he was convinced that Talat Mahmood was the right singer for some of ‘Jahan Ara’s’ songs, the director was insistent that Rafi saab be given all the songs. My father did not budge and was willing to give up the film. The same thing happened when he chose Rafi saab over Kishore Kumar for the songs of ‘Laila Majnu’. The directors finally gave in and these films became musical landmarks,” Kohli writes. Overshadowed by Kishore Kumar in the post-‘Aradhana’ era, the superhit songs of ‘Laila Majnu’ helped Rafi stage a strong comeback.Like the finest of whiskeys, many of Madan Mohan’s compositions have aged remarkably well and his reputation vaulted. In the run-up to his 100th birth centenary, celebrations of his life and songs are planned in places such as Mumbai, Surat, Pune and others. The master music maker would have loved that.",Madan Mohan's birth centenary is on June 25. The composer didn't take home a single Filmfare statuette in a career spanning 25 years. The songs he composed were invariably better than the movies they were located in. His son Sanjeev Kohli writes that the lack of mass adulation always caused him anguish.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111200294,imgsize-31114,width-400,resizemode-4/111200294.jpg"
"Isro's reusable launch vehicle completes 3rd landing test, paving way for orbital re-entry",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/isros-reusable-launch-vehicle-completes-3rd-landing-test-paving-way-for-orbital-re-entry/articleshow/111200124.cms,"BENGALURU: Isro, which had, on March 22 completed the second landing experiment of its reusable launch vehicle (RLV) — “RLV-LEX-02” — Sunday conducted the third landing experiment ( RLV-LEX-03 ), paving the way for an orbital re-entry test.The test was conducted at 7.10am at the Aeronautical Test Range (ATR) at Challakere in Chitradurga district, some 220km from Bengaluru. The RLV project is an important programme that will demonstrate one of the technologies needed to meet India’s ambitions of sustained human presence in space.The RLV-LEX-03, built upon RLV-LEX-02, was aimed at improving the vehicle’s performance, guidance, and landing capabilities. TOI had reported last week that, weather permitting, Isro would attempt to achieve this milestone in the development of RLV technology this week.S Unnikrishnan Nair, director, Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC), which has developed the RLV, had told TOI that compared to the previous LEX, Nair said, RLV-LEX3 will be more challenging as the “intentional cross-range error of around 500m will be tested, compared to around 150m during LEX-02 and that the velocity azimuth with respect to the runway centre was adjusted to 2°, deviating from the previous mission’s 0° alignment.On Sunday, Isro said: “RLV-LEX-03 re-demonstrated the autonomous landing capability of the RLV under more challenging release conditions (cross range of 500 m) and more severe wind conditions. The vehicle, named 'Pushpak, was released from an IAF Chinook helicopter at an altitude of 4.5km.”From a release point, the vehicle autonomously executed cross-range correction manoeuvres, approached the runway and performed a precise horizontal landing at the runway centreline. “Due to its low lift-to-drag ratio aerodynamic configuration, the landing velocity exceeded 320kmph, compared to 260kmph for a commercial aircraft and 280 kmph for a typical fighter aircraft.,” Isro said.After touchdown, the vehicle velocity was reduced to nearly 100kmph using its brake parachute, after which the landing gear brakes were employed for deceleration and stop on the runway.“During this ground roll phase, the vehicle utilised its rudder and nose wheel steering system to autonomously maintain a stable and precise ground roll along the runway, Isro said, adding that the mission simulated the approach and landing interface and high-speed landing conditions for a vehicle returning from space,” Isro said.The mission had another advancement: Implementation of an advanced guidance algorithm that can simultaneously correct errors in both the longitudinal and lateral planes — essential for the future orbital re-entry mission. This decoupled algorithm, an improvement over LEX-02’s approach, will be utilised to enhance the reusable launch vehicle’s precision and control.“The RLV-LEX uses multisensor fusion including sensors like inertial sensor, radar altimeter, flush air data system, pseudolite system and NaviC. Notably, the mission reused the winged body and flight systems as such without any modification, from the LEX-02 mission, demonstrating the robustness of Isro’s capability of design to reuse flight systems for multiple missions,” Isro said.This mission simulates the approach & landing interface and high-speed landing conditions for a vehicle returning from space, which will reaffirm Isro’s expertise in acquiring the most critical technologies required for the development of an RLV.","The test was conducted at 7.10am at the Aeronautical Test Range (ATR) at Challakere in Chitradurga district, 220km from Bengaluru.

It is the second such deepfake video of Reliance Industries boss endorsing a stock trading mentorship programme doing the rounds - in the earlier one in March, he was seen urging viewers to follow his ""student Veenit"" on social media for free-of-cost investment advice.

Dr K K H Patil was duped between May 28 and June 10 when she transferred a total of Rs 7.1 lakh to 16 different bank accounts after being attracted by the promise of high returns and Ambani's ""endorsement"". She realised the fraud when she tried to withdraw the Rs 30 lakh that reflected on the trading website as profit she had earned on her initial investment.

Oshiwara police on Wednesday filed an FIR against an unidentified person under IPC sections for impersonation and cheating and under the IT Act section for identity theft. Police said the scamsters had used deepfake technology to create the video. Police are in touch with nodal officers of banks to block the money that she was made to transfer, an officer said.

Patil said she came across the video on Instagram and was convinced by seemingly legitimate endorsement. She invested her money after researching online, which showed the company had offices in BKC and London.

"Eye on China, India to help Bangladesh conserve Teesta river",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/eye-on-china-india-to-help-bangladesh-conserve-teesta-river/articleshow/111196158.cms,"Top Picks For You Hasina's visit reflects deep ties: President Droupadi Murmu

NEW DELHI: India and Bangladesh signed 10 agreements/ MoUs and announced over a dozen other initiatives - spanning across areas like connectivity, health, trade, energy, defence and maritime cooperation - as PM Narendra Modi hosted his counterpart Sheikh Hasina for the first state visit after the formation of the new NDA government. Among the new initiatives was an announcement by Modi after the meeting that India will soon send a technical team to Bangladesh for management and conservation of the Teesta river inside Bangladesh.The announcement is significant as it comes amid efforts by China to convince Dhaka to allow it to develop the Teesta basin. Aware of India’s reservations about China’s role, Bangladesh has maintained it will consider “geopolitical issues” before going ahead with the project, which will apparently cost $ 1 billion.Hasina is expected to soon visit China, a country Dhaka - in a fine balancing act - continues to have strong economic ties with for its development needs. “As part of our development cooperation, we will also undertake conservation and management of Teesta River inside Bangladesh with Indian assistance within a mutually agreed timeframe,” said a joint statement, in which the leaders announced a shared vision for commerce, connectivity and collaboration.Sharing of Teesta waters has remained a long outstanding issue between the countries, after opposition from West Bengal prevented them from signing a water-sharing agreement finalised during the UPA government. India’s technical team is expected to first examine if there’s any need for a reservoir to be built, something which the Chinese have reportedly suggested. For India, it’s important that Bangladesh remains mindful of Indian security concerns while pursuing economic projects with Beijing.The leaders also welcomed formation of a Joint Technical Committee to initiate discussions for the renewal of the Ganges Water Sharing Treaty of 1996. They pledged to intensify cooperation in border management, counterterrorism and against radicalisation, while agreeing to start talks for a comprehensive economic partnership agreement (CEPA).“We have prepared a futuristic vision for cooperation in new areas. We have managed to restore in the past 10 years connectivity that was there before 1965. We will now focus on energy and digital connectivity. We will soon launch CEPA negotiations to take our economic cooperation to new heights,” said Modi.There was focus on long-term defence cooperation as well as India and Bangladesh signed an MoU for cooperation concerning military education in the field of strategic and operational studies. For modernization of the Bangladesh Armed Forces, the leaders said they will explore defence industrial cooperation, while ramping up military engagements in the form of exercises, training and capability development.The 2 countries announced signing of agreements for digital and green partnerships, as also a significant initiative by India to provide e- visa for medical patients from Bangladesh. “To facilitate easier cross-border travel and as a supportive gesture to the friendly people of Bangladesh, India will extend e-Medical Visa facility to people from Bangladesh travelling to India for medical treatment,” said the joint statement, adding India will also help Dhaka with supply of essential commodities.Other major announcements included new Assistant High Commission of India in Rangpur in Bangladesh, train service between Rajshahi and Kolkata and bus service between Chittagong and Kolkata. To promote sub-regional connectivity, government said India will extend transit facilities for movement of Bangladesh goods to Nepal and Bhutan through railway network.India is also looking at early operationalization of two Special Economic Zones (SEZs) offered by Bangladesh to India in Mongla and Mirsharai and to opening of new border-haats. The 2 countries also signed an MoU to enhance railway connectivity. The joint statement also said they will pursue collaboration in frontier technologies, including civil nuclear, oceanography and space technology. “To this end, we will partner in joint development of a small satellite for Bangladesh and its launch using Indian launch vehicle,” it said.",India and Bangladesh signed 10 agreements/ MoUs and announced over a dozen other initiatives.

NEW DELHI: Cracking the whip on latecomers , the Centre's department of personnel and training (DoPT) has decided to condone a maximum delay of 15 minutes, and instructed employees across the country to be in office latest by 9.15am and mark their attendance. All employees, including senior officers, have been told to use the biometric attendance system, something several of them have not been using ever since the Covid outbreak four years ago.Staff members have been cautioned that half-day casual leave will be deducted in case they do not turn up by 9.15 in the morning. ""For any reason, if the employee is not able to attend office on a particular day, it should be informed in advance and casual leave should be applied for,"" the circular said, adding that officers will monitor the attendance and punctuality of employees in their sections.Central govt offices are open from 9am to 5.30pm but it is normal for junior-level employees to turn up late and leave early, including those in public-facing jobs, inconveniencing people.Senior officers complain that they do not have any fixed office hours as they usually leave after 7pm. Besides, they argue that post-Covid, with access to electronic files, they often end up working from home, including on holidays or over the weekend. Soon after coming to office in 2014, Modi govt had sought to enforce office timings , which was resisted by employees, many of whom argued that they travel long distances.Aadhaar-enabled biometric attendance system was monitored to ensure that people were on time, until Covid led to suspension of the mechanism. Several senior officers had installed biometric devices on their table to avoid standing in queues to mark their attendance.The latest directive refers to instructions issued last year which had asked central govt employees to revert to biometric attendance, which was resumed in Feb 2022. ""Habitual late coming and early leaving of office should be viewed seriously and discouraged. Action against the same may be initiated,"" it had said.In departments, where IT-enabled faceless mechanism of dealing with public has been put in place, several employees routinely skip office or come in for a short while. The move is expected to enforce greater discipline but will also annoy employees who routinely walk in at 10am or even after that.","Central govt offices are open from 9am to 5.30pm but it is normal for junior- level employees to turn up late and leave early, including those in public- facing jobs.

"With Parliament in session, PM Modi likely to skip SCO meet in Kazakhstan on July 3-4",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/with-parliament-in-session-pm-modi-likely-to-skip-sco-meet-in-kazakhstan-on-july-3-4/articleshow/111196227.cms,"NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi is likely to skip the SCO summit which will be hosted by Kazakhstan in Astana on July 3-4, official sources said. The PM has in the past regularly participated in the Eurasian bloc's summit meetings but the fact that Parliament session will continue till July 3 is believed to be one of the reasons for Modi deciding to give it a miss this time.

Apart from having a possible bilateral with President Vladimir Putin, Modi was also expected to come face to face with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif at the summit for the first time since taking over as PM for the third time earlier this month.

Given the state of relations with both countries, Modi perhaps won't mind not having any sort of engagement with Xi and Sharif. India, however, has said in the past it attaches great importance to SCO for peace, stability and economic development of the region.

Modi had in 2018 coined the SECURE acronym that stands for Security; Economy and Trade; Connectivity; Unity; Respect for Sovereignty and Territorial Integrity; and Environment. Despite its full membership of SCO, India remains an outlier in the group in the sense that it's the only member to not endorse China's BRI and to not have any bilateral engagement with Pakistan. India has used the SCO platform to repeatedly remind member-states, particularly Pakistan and China, that one of the original mandates of the group was to fight terrorism and that connectivity initiatives must respect sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states.

The SCO summit was hosted by India last year but in a virtual mode. India held the SCO chairmanship last year.

","PM Narendra Modi will not attend the SCO summit in Kazakhstan on July 3-4. India is the only country in the group not to have a bilateral with China or Pakistan. India has said it attaches great importance to SCO for peace, stability and development.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111196234,imgsize-895393,width-400,resizemode-4/111196234.jpg"

He informed the Chief Minister about the plans to establish a 25-bed modern hospital equipped with advanced facilities at Parsa. Earlier, he visited the PEKB mines to take stock on the ongoing operations, re-forestation activities and CSR work being carried out at the project area.After his visit to Parsa and his meeting with the Chief Minister, Nagar told reporters that they also believed in sustainable mining and that RRVUNL’s projects were a win-win situation for both Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan. Referring to criticism against tree felling for mining operations, the minister said nearly 94,000 trees have been cut so far for mining while systematic work was in progress for carrying out reforestation on the reclaimed land after mining. He pointed out that more than 1.1 million trees had already been planted, including Sal trees, to maintain the natural biodiversity even after reforestation.Pointing out that Rajasthan has been procuring coal for over a decade to meet its coal demand for generating 4300MW of power, the energy minister said besides PEKB, the centre has allotted two more blocks, Parsa and Kante extension. “There is an urgent need to develop and start operations at the two other coal blocks, Parsa and Kante extension, as it will make Rajasthan self-reliant in meeting the coal demands and reduce its dependence on Coal India for procuring coal.""Noting that PEKB was the only coal mine in Chhattisgarh with a five-star rating from the Ministry of Coal, Nagar said Rajasthan wished to take this to the next level by introducing energy-efficient practices and continuing to work closely with local communities to empower them.

There were also assertions that the question paper had been leaked prior to the examination. Suspicions were raised about potential malpractices at particular exam centres.SC once again declined to halt the counselling process for admissions based on the results of the NEET-UG examination.

4 reasons why CM Punk will become the heel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/wwe/top-stories/4-reasons-why-cm-punk-will-become-the-heel/articleshow/111173439.cms,"Here are the 4 major reasons why CM Punk will become the heel soon

1) World Heavyweight Championship

2) Rivalry against Seth and Damian

3) He is the best heel in the world

4) The Scotland Screw Job

The storyline involving Drew McIntyre has taken a dramatic turn due to CM Punk's actions. In a recent episode of RAW, Drew McIntyre announced his resignation and left the arena, attributing his decision to CM Punk, who has twice cost him the World Title. Punk has made a habit of interfering in McIntyre's matches, starting at Wrestlemania 40 and continuing at Clash at the Castle 2024. These actions strongly suggest a heel turn for Punk. However, the question remains: when will he fully embrace his role as a villain, or has he been a heel all along while fans were too entertained by his antics to notice? Let's explore five major reasons why CM Punk could officially turn heel soon.CM Punk has held both the World Championship and WWE Championship multiple times in WWE. Throughout his career, he has competed against top-tier superstars, proving himself as the ""Best in the World."" When Punk returned at the 2023 Survivor Series, he received a push from the company and earned the opportunity to face Seth Rollins for the World Title at WrestleMania 40. However, during the Royal Rumble match, Drew McIntyre hit Punk with a Future Shock DDT, causing an arm injury that forced Punk out of the WrestleMania title match.Drew replaced Punk in the match, ultimately defeating Seth Rollins to win the World Title. However, during his victory celebration, where he taunted Punk at the announce table, Punk retaliated with a quick assault. Taking advantage of the chaos, Damian Priest cashed in his Money in the Bank briefcase and defeated Drew to become the new World Champion.Punk's actions suggest he is still focused on the World Title, possibly viewing Drew as his nemesis and employing mind games to remove him from his path. This could mean that Punk may also target Damian Priest in the future as part of his quest for the championship.For now, fans can assume that the rivalry between Drew McIntyre and CM Punk is over. CM Punk is now shifting his focus to Seth ""Freakin"" Rollins and Damian Priest. Although CM Punk always interfered with Drew McIntyre, it doesn't mean he has a friendly relationship with Damian Priest. With Drew off television for a while, CM Punk needs someone new to feud with, and Seth Rollins and Damian Priest are prime candidates. It's highly likely that CM Punk will interfere during the World Title match between Damian and Seth at Money in the Bank 2024. This will solidify CM Punk's role as a true heel in the company.Believe it or not, CM Punk is the best in the business when it comes to playing a heel. He has consistently been one of the greatest heels of all time, with his mic skills being his greatest asset. Punk's words can easily rub salt in anyone's wounds, and that's exactly what he's doing with Drew right now.His storyline with Drew is receiving positive responses from audiences, who appreciate Punk's portrayal of a negative character in Drew's life. It’s possible that WWE might fully embrace Punk's dark side and present him as a true heel in Drew's storyline. True CM Punk fans also enjoy seeing him as a bad guy, which is why WWE might soon bring about Punk's heel turn.Punk faced criticism for his interference in the World title match between Drew and Damian. Acting as a referee, he halted the count at two, which angered many fans, particularly those in Glasgow. Most attendees were disappointed, as they had hoped to see their Scottish Warrior win the World Title. This backlash from Scottish fans marks the beginning of CM Punk's heel turn. It's only a matter of time before the entire WWE Universe grows tired of his actions and begins expressing their frustration.","Drew McIntyre announced his resignation and left the arena, attributing his decision to CM Punk.

My banter with Paul Heyman became the stuff of legend, and I am so thankful for all he has done to elevate my career. I gained a wealth of knowledge from the Wise man and for that, I’ll be eternally grateful.”“In 2016, the legendary Michael Cole brought me in to begin my WWE career as a ring announcer with NXT, but I quickly found myself touring the globe, hosting hall of fame ceremonies, kickoff shows and helping launch WWE’s first weekly morning show, “The Bump”. I exited “The Bump” after more than 200 shows and a move to Los Angeles.”“Now on the west coast, I have been offered new opportunities that will further utilize the skills I gained working for the largest sports entertainment company in the world. I am extremely thankful to Triple H , Nick Khan, WWE and all of its partners for allowing me to be a trusted voice on WWE television for all these years.”“Thank you to every single person who made me feel like this was my home and that I was a part of this family. Thank you for taking a chance on me and welcoming this outsider with open arms. I hope I made you proud and I’d love it if you’d stay with me for this next chapter. I’m excited to reveal to all of you what I have coming up next!!!!”Fightful Select also reported that Braxton is finalizing a verbal agreement since her contract has already expired. The report mentions that discussions took place, but the outcomes are unknown. Additionally, AEW was reportedly aware of her contract status a few weeks ago, but it is unclear if either side took any action.On the June 21st edition of WWE Smackdown , Kayla Braxton made multiple appearances throughout the show. After Drew McIntyre brutally assaulted CM Punk backstage, leaving him a bloody mess and requiring ambulance transport, Braxton provided an update. She stated that McIntyre would appear on Monday’s Raw, while Punk was spending the night in the hospital for evaluation following the vicious attack.","Kayla Braxton is officially leaving WWE after nearly eight years with the company.

Instagram showing sexual Reels to teens,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/instagram-showing-sexual-reels-to-teens/articleshow/111166707.cms,"Instagram is recommending sexual videos to users as young as 13 years old, according to a new study. The Wall Street Journal and a researcher from Northeastern University conducted tests over seven months that revealed alarming results.The study found that Instagram's video feature, called Reels , quickly began showing sexually suggestive content to test accounts set up as 13-year-olds. Within just three minutes of creating an account, sexual videos started appearing. After 20 minutes, the feeds were filled with adult content creators offering nude photos.""Instagram largely stopped recommending the comedy and stunt videos and fed the test accounts a steady stream of videos in which women pantomimed sex acts, graphically described their anatomy or caressed themselves to music with provocative lyrics,"" the Journal reported.The researchers created new Instagram accounts pretending to be 13-year-old users. They then watched videos in the Reels section, skipping over normal content but lingering on suggestive videos. They did not follow any accounts or search for specific content.At first, Instagram showed a mix of videos, including comedy and car clips. However, it soon began recommending more explicit content when the test accounts watched suggestive videos to completion. In some cases, Instagram recommended ""video after video about anal sex"" to a test account posing as a young teen.The Journal noted that similar tests on TikTok and Snapchat did not produce the same results. Those platforms did not recommend sexual videos to fake teen accounts.Meta , the company that owns Instagram, disputed the findings. A spokesperson called it ""an artificial experiment that doesn't match the reality of how teens use Instagram."" The company said it has been working to reduce sensitive content shown to teens.However, the Journal reported that Meta's own internal research has found similar problems. In 2021, company safety staff ran tests that produced comparable results. A 2022 internal analysis showed that Instagram displays more inappropriate content to young users than to adults.The findings come as social media companies face increasing scrutiny over their impact on young users. Meta has been sued multiple times over allegations of failing to protect children from exploitation on its platforms. In January, Meta announced stricter content controls for teens, but the recent tests suggest these measures may not be fully effective.","Instagram is recommending sexual videos to users as young as 13, according to a new study.

Heat wave in India: IMD has this important AC advisory for everyone,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/heat-wave-in-india-imd-has-this-important-ac-advisory-for-everyone/articleshow/111154670.cms,"What exactly IMD said on AC temperature

How setting AC at 24 degrees or higher can help save electricity bill

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has an important message for people across the country. In the midst of the ongoing heatwave, IMD has issued an important advisory on the right AC temperature. In its ‘Dos and Don’ts for Heat Wave ’ guideline document, IMD has recommended people to keep their AC temperature to 24 degrees or higher.“Maintain AC temperature at 24 degrees or higher. This will reduce your electricity bill and make your health better,” reads the document.Incidentally, it is not just IMD, but also the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) that recommends 24 degrees Celsius as the optimal temperature for AC for human comfort.One of the most common myths about ACs is that setting the temperature to the lowest cools the room faster. In reality, this makes the AC work harder to reach the set temperature. The AC's thermostat directs it to cool the environment to the desired temperature. For instance, setting it to 18 degrees Celsius keeps the compressor running continuously, increasing energy consumption.Conversely, setting the AC to 24 degrees Celsius or higher allows it to achieve the desired temperature over a few hours. This approach cycles the compressor on and off as needed, reducing both pressure on the compressor as well as electricity usage.","The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has an important message for people across the country.

The move comes in response to new age verification laws aimed at preventing minors from accessing adult content online.Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, and Nebraska will join seven other states where Pornhub has already restricted access. The company says it's taking this action to protest laws that require users to upload government-issued ID to prove they are over 18 before viewing adult content.Pornhub argues these laws create privacy risks and could lead to identity theft . The company claims that when similar laws were implemented in Louisiana, traffic to their site dropped by 80%. They worry this pushes users to less secure websites that don't follow safety guidelines.""These laws have not only failed at protecting minors but have introduced further harm,"" Pornhub stated in a blog post. The company believes a better solution would be age verification through device operating systems, which would only require users to verify their age once.The adult entertainment industry faces increasing regulation across the United States. Some states have declared pornography a public health crisis. However, websites like Pornhub say the new laws violate free speech rights protected by the First Amendment.Critics of the age verification laws, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation , call them ""surveillance systems"" that could lead to misuse of sensitive data. They worry about the collection and potential sale of private information.Pornhub encourages its users to speak out against these laws and contact local governments to push for better solutions. The company acknowledges that ""normalizing sex work and sexual expression is an uphill battle"" but believes change is possible through education and public engagement.As more states consider similar legislation, the debate over online privacy, child protection, and freedom of expression is likely to continue.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations. These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class. The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
Eight from ship that crashed into Baltimore bridge leave for India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/eight-from-ship-that-crashed-into-baltimore-bridge-leave-for-india/articleshow/111196518.cms,"WASHINGTON: Eight Indian crew members of the cargo ship 'Dali' that crashed into a famed Baltimore bridge in March left for India on Friday after nearly three months on the mammoth vessel. According to Baltimore Maritime Exchange, four of the 21 crew members are still on board the 984-foot cargo ship MV Dali , which is tentatively scheduled to leave Friday evening for Norfolk, Virginia.

The rest of the crew has been moved to a service apartment in Baltimore and will remain there pending an investigation. Notably, 20 of the crew members were Indian nationals. They were on board the MV Dali Cargo, which struck the pillars of Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge resulting in its collapse and the death of six construction workers in the tragic incident. Dali will undergo repair at Norfolk.

The departure of eight Indian crew members including a cook, a fitter and seamen follows a deal approved by the judge. None of these are officers. The rest 13 would remain in the US, mainly because of the pending investigations. ""They're anxious, under considerable stress considering they don't know the future. They don't know when they'll see their family again or how they'll be treated here,"" Rev Joshua Messick, director of the Baltimore International Seafarers' Center and chaplain for the Port of Baltimore told CNN.

None of the crew members have been charged in connection with the disaster. FBI and other federal agencies are conducting the investigations.

A newly detected signal might finally provide answers to the long-standing mystery of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 , which vanished nearly ten years ago. British researchers from Cardiff University have identified a fresh clue that could help pinpoint the final resting place of the ill-fated jet.The signal, detected recently, is being hailed as a significant development in the search for MH370, which disappeared on March 8, 2014, with 239 people on board. Despite extensive searches over the years, the plane's exact location has remained elusive.Richard Godfrey, a British engineer who has been heavily involved in the search efforts, said, ""We have detected a weak signal that could potentially be from the aircraft. This is the first time we have such a lead in years.""The researchers believe the new signal could help narrow down the search area in the southern Indian Ocean, where the aircraft is believed to have ended its flight. The signal's detection comes after years of using advanced technology and simulations to trace the plane's final moments.Experts involved in the search are cautiously optimistic about this development. ""This signal could be the breakthrough we have been waiting for. We hope it will bring closure to the families of those on board,"" said another member of the research team.The disappearance of MH370 has been one of aviation's greatest mysteries, leading to numerous theories and extensive international search efforts. The search for MH370 has been one of the most challenging and complex in aviation history, involving multiple countries, advanced technology, and extensive resources.Following the disappearance, a massive international search operation was launched. Initial efforts focused on the South China Sea but later shifted to the southern Indian Ocean based on satellite data.The first phase involved surface searches by ships and aircraft, covering thousands of square kilometers. Despite the vast efforts, no debris was found in the initial stages.In April 2014, Australia's Ocean Shield vessel, equipped with advanced underwater search technology, was deployed. It searched for acoustic signals from the aircraft's black boxes but found no conclusive evidence.Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) like Bluefin-21 and GO Phoenix were deployed to conduct detailed seafloor searches in the Indian Ocean's search zones, covering areas with depths of up to 6,000 meters.In July 2015, a flaperon from MH370 was discovered on Réunion Island, confirming the aircraft had ended in the Indian Ocean. This discovery spurred new hope and directed the focus on the southern Indian Ocean.Over the next year, more debris washed ashore on islands in the Indian Ocean and African east coast, including parts of the wing, stabilizers, and cabin interior.After covering over 120,000 square kilometers of seafloor without locating the main wreckage, the official search was suspended in January 2017. The challenging underwater terrain, including deep trenches and volcanic activity, hindered efforts.Ocean Infinity Search: In early 2018, private company Ocean Infinity conducted a renewed search using advanced AUVs, covering an additional 112,000 square kilometers. Despite their efforts, no new debris was located.","The signal detected recently is being hailed as a significant development in the search for MH370.

'Spent more on pet dog than servant'

A Swiss court has sentenced four members of the wealthy Hinduja family to up to four years and six months in jail on Friday for exploiting their domestic workers.The Hinduja family, known for their vast business empire spanning various sectors, tops the Sunday Times list of the UK's 350 richest people with an estimated fortune of £37 billion. However, Gopi Hinduja himself was not named in the case.The Hinduja Group, controlled by the family, has diverse business interests ranging from trucks and lubricants to banking and cable television.The group was founded by Parmanand Deepchand Hinduja, who started his merchant banking and trade businesses in British India before moving to Bombay in 1914 and expanding internationally to Iran in 1919.The brothers later shifted their base to London in 1979, where it remains today, with the group claiming to employ 200,000 people worldwide.Srichand P Hinduja, the eldest son, took over the reins in 1935 and is credited with founding IndusInd Bank. Following his death in May 2023, Gopichand Hinduja assumed the role of Chairman and is recognized for the Group's ventures into the power and infrastructure sectors.The family's wealth and influence have been significant, with Forbes ranking them as the seventh richest in India and the 146th richest globally in recent years.In a recent court case in Switzerland, Indian-born businessman Prakash Hinduja and his family members were found guilty of exploiting workers and providing unauthorized employment. The court dismissed the human trafficking charges, saying that the staff understood the conditions they were agreeing to.The Hinduja family, long-time residents of Switzerland, faced accusations of confiscating workers' passports, paying them in rupees instead of Swiss francs, restricting their movement, and forcing them to work excessively long hours for low wages. This was not Prakash Hinduja's first offense, as he had been convicted on similar, though less severe, charges in 2007. Prosecutors alleged that he continued to employ people without proper documentation despite the previous conviction.It was disclosed last week that the family had reached an undisclosed settlement with the plaintiffs. Swiss authorities have already seized various assets, including precious stones and jewelry, which could be used to cover legal fees and potential penalties resulting from the case.According to Swiss prosecutor Yves Bertossa, the family spent more money on their pet dog than they paid one of their servants.The prosecutor delivered a scathing critique of the Hinduja family's actions, recommending jail sentences of up to five and a half years for those involved. Bertossa's arguments were based on testimonies provided by the staff and the Hindujas themselves, as well as evidence gathered during his investigation into the matter.""They spent more for one dog than one of their servants,"" he said. The prosecutor revealed that the woman was paid as little as 7 Swiss francs ($7.84) for a working day that lasted up to 18 hours, seven days a week. He also pointed to a budget document titled ""Pets"", which demonstrated that the family spent 8,584 Swiss francs in a year on their family dog.","Four members of the Hinduja family sentenced to up to four years and six months in jail for exploiting domestic workers.

President Joe Biden recently ordered a crackdown on the US-Mexico border if illegal crossings top 2,500 per day for seven consecutive days.Bill panned the order calling it as a pre-election 'Hail Mary' that won't work. ""If Biden loses this election, it's going to be because of two things: He's old… and immigration. I mean, just on a political level, I don't think they could have handled it worse,"" he opined.""The question that Democrats don't seem to be able to have the balls to answer is just how many is too many?
