TMC's Abhishek Banerjee gives big update on INDIA bloc's future in 2026 West Bengal polls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tmcs-abhishek-banerjee-gives-big-update-on-india-blocs-future-in-2026-west-bengal-polls/articleshow/118217265.cms,"Poll What Influences Your Voting Decision the Most? Party's Track Record and Past Performance Political Leader’s Vision and Promises

NEW DELHI: Amid apparent rift in INDIA bloc after Maharashtra and now Delhi loss, Trinamool Congress’s Abhishek Banerjee has seemingly delivered another blow to the opposition alliance.The Diamond Harbour MP hinted at a possible solo run for the party in the West Bengal polls scheduled for 2026. Banerjee suggested that TMC had performed better when contesting independently, while leaving the door open for discussions on alliances.""Didi (Mamata Banerjee) has already made it clear that we will fight alone in Bengal. This is nothing new. We fought alone in 2014, 2016, 2019, and 2024. We performed well then, and we will do so again,"" he said.""We are part of the INDIA bloc for a larger cause. But in Bengal, we have always fought alone and won. We will do it again,"" he added.While he acknowledged the importance of alliances at the national level, he said the party had historically performed well when fighting solo. However, he added, “Let’s wait, we have a lot of time.”TMC chief and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee had earlier ruled out any alliance with Congress in the state elections. According to TMC’s mouthpiece ‘Jago Bangla,’ she told party legislators, “Trinamool will return to power with a two-thirds majority in 2026. We do not need anyone’s help. We will fight alone and win alone.”Her comments prompted sharp reactions from the Congress’s West Bengal unit, which claimed that regional parties had realised their mistake of ignoring Congress after the Delhi polls. Congress leaders cited AAP’s losses in Delhi as proof that a divided opposition only helped the BJP.The BJP, meanwhile, dismissed Mamata Banerjee’s assertions, claiming that the people of Bengal were ready to reject the ruling party over alleged corruption and nepotism. BJP leaders, including Suvendu Adhikari and Sukanta Majumdar, drew comparisons between Bengal and Delhi, arguing that welfare schemes may not translate into electoral gains.Following Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury’s removal as state Congress president and the appointment of Subhankar Sarkar, speculation arose about a possible understanding between Congress and TMC. However, Mamata Banerjee firmly rejected the idea, saying, “There is no question of an alliance. Trinamool will fight alone and secure a historic victory. The Congress doesn’t have any presence in Bengal.”While the TMC, Congress, and CPI(M) are all part of the INDIA bloc at the national level, political alliances in West Bengal remain uncertain. Congress and the Left had aligned against both TMC and BJP in previous elections.BJP leaders, however, remain confident that the party will emerge victorious, regardless of TMC’s strategy. BJP leader Rahul Sinha said, “Whether TMC fights alone or with Congress, the result will be the same. The people of Bengal want to get rid of corruption and nepotism.”","Abhishek Banerjee hints at a possible solo run for the party in the West Bengal polls scheduled for 2026.

No need to worry about Nitish Kumar: JDU

NEW DELHI: Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Aaditya Thackeray on Thursday issued a warning to Bihar CM Nitish Kumar and Andhra Pradesh CM N Chandrababu Naidu, both key members of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led NDA alliance at the Centre.Referencing the collapse of the Shiv Sena government—a move his party has long accused the BJP of orchestrating—Thackeray cautioned that what happened to his party could also happen to them in the future. He warned that the BJP’s ongoing campaign to weaken regional parties poses a serious threat to their political futures.He also raised concerns about alleged electoral malpractice, including voter fraud and electronic voting machine (EVM) manipulation. Ahead of meeting former Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, Thackeray said, ""The future of our country is in doubt. We do not know where our vote is going amid voter fraud and EVM fraud. Are elections in India still free and fair? What happened to us, Kejriwal ji, and Congress could happen to Nitish ji, RJD, and Chandrababu ji Naidu in the future.""He accused the BJP of systematically targeting regional parties, saying, ""BJP's dream is to break up and finish off every regional party, just as they are doing with democracy in this country.""Following his meeting with Arvind Kejriwal in Delhi, Thackeray reiterated the importance of opposition unity in addressing electoral issues. ""Governments come and go, but our relationship will remain. The people of Delhi know the work Kejriwal has done over the last decade. The Election Commission played a major role in the Delhi elections. The INDIA Bloc and all opposition parties must strategise on the next steps, as elections in our democracy are no longer free and fair,"" he said.Thackeray's comments come amid growing concerns within the opposition over alleged irregularities in the electoral process. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi recently highlighted discrepancies in Maharashtra's voter registration figures, claiming that 39 lakh new voters were added in just five months after the Lok Sabha elections. He also alleged that Maharashtra's registered voter count exceeded the state's total adult population.On Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Aaditya Thackeray's statement, JDU MP Sanjay Kumar Jha says, ""He has no knowledge of ground reality. The backward, Dalit, and poor communities of Bihar started voting only after the EVM was introduced. Before that, when voting used to happen using ballot paper, people used to steal the booths... He (Aaditya Thackeray) does not need to worry about JDU and Nitish Kumar...""In response to Aaditya Thackeray’s statement, JDU MP Sanjay Kumar Jha has criticised Thackeray’s understanding of the situation in Bihar. Jha stated, ""He has no knowledge of the ground reality. The backward, Dalit, and poor communities of Bihar only began voting after the introduction of the EVM. Prior to that, when ballots were used, booth capturing was rampant.""Jha further asserted that Thackeray should not be concerned about the JDU or Nitish Kumar.","Aaditya Thackeray warns Bihar CM Nitish Kumar and Andhra Pradesh CM N Chandrababu Naidu that what happened to his party could also happen to them in the future.

Congress accuses govt of 'bulldozing' waqf report in Parliament



New Delhi: The joint parliamentary committee report on the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, which proposes to overhaul management of waqf properties, was tabled in Parliament on Thursday with the Lok Sabha Speaker allowing the addition of the dissent notes in their entirety to the annexure.Home minister Amit Shah had earlier said his party had no objection to the dissent notes being attached to the report without redaction. Rules of procedure authorise the JPC chairman to use his discretion to decide on the inclusion of dissent notes. JPC chairman Jagdambika Pal had left out dissent notes which, it is learned, were critical of the committee's functioning. In Rajya Sabha, a corrigendum was issued to reflect the addition of dissent notes.Both Houses opened to protests from the opposition which sought withdrawal of the report and alleged that the dissent notes were not included in the report in their entirety and portions were removed. The govt denied the charge and accused the opposition of politics of appeasement. The showdown saw the opposition walking out.The proceedings saw treasury benches deny the opposition charge that report was ""non-democratic"" and ""fake"" and labelled those opposing it to be ""anti-national"".With the Budget session breaking for recess and the House set to resume from March 10, govt will now bring the revamped bill next month after cabinet approval in keeping with the JPC's recommendations to Parliament.When Pal tabled the report in the Lok Sabha, opposition MPs shouted slogans and rushed to the well in protest while the treasury benches applauded. Speaker Om Birla said he had added the dissent notes of panel members to the annexures of the report.Speaking amid the protests, Shah said, ""Some opposition members have objected that their dissent notes have not been annexed fully. I wish to request you on behalf of my party that whatever your objections, you can attach them to the report. My party (BJP) has no objection to it.""In the Rajya Sabha, tension escalated soon after the report was tabled, forcing Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar to adjourn the House briefly. The chairman named Samirul Islam, Nadimul Haque and M Mohamed Abdulla for creating ""chaos and disruption in the House"". Leader of the opposition Mallikarjun Kharge was then called to speak.""Bulldozing the report by only keeping the views of the majority members is not right. It is condemnable, non-democratic,"" Kharge said while calling it a ""fake report"". He demanded that it should be withdrawn and sent back to a committee.Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju said, ""There is no deletion or removal of any part of the report. Don't mislead the House. The allegation is false.""","Congress accuses govt of 'bulldozing' waqf report in Parliament.
