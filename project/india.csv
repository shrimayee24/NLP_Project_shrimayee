Arvind Kejriwal's Punjab visit for vipassana stirs 'luxury' row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/arvind-kejriwals-punjab-visit-for-vipassana-stirs-luxury-row/articleshow/118746442.cms,"Photo/Agencies

NEW DELHI: BJP and Congress launched a scathing attack on Aam Aadmi Party national convener Arvind Kejriwal questioning scale of the security convoy that accompanied him on Tuesday as he arrived in Hoshiarpur in Punjab for a 10-day Vipassana meditation retreat and his continued access to privileges even as he holds no office.AAP returned fire alleging that BJP was engaging in an ""unnecessary slander campaign"" and claimed that Kejriwal was accompanied by security as per the Z plus security cover approved by the ministry of home affairs. Hoshiarpur SSP Sandeep Kumar Malik said Kejriwal was Z-plus protectee and the security cover was provided to him accordingly.Since losing Delhi polls, this is the first time Kejriwal has left Delhi and his decision to choose Punjab for Vipasanna meditation has yet again given rise to speculations of whether he is now looking at a bigger role in Punjab.Last week, the surprise announcement by AAP of its Rajya Sabha MP Sanjeev Arora's candidature for contesting the yet to be notified bypoll for Ludhiana West constituency in Punjab on Wednesday triggered speculation that the vacancy in Upper House was being created to eventually make way for Kejriwal's entry to Parliament. AAP leadership rejected the claim.A fresh controversy broke out when a video showing Kejriwal's 21-vehicle cavalcade went viral online on Wednesday as it entered the forest rest house in Chauhal, Hoshiarpur, on Tuesday night. Another video of him going to a vipassana centre in Anandgarh village, 12 km from Hoshiarpur, emerged in which the vehicle count was close to two dozen.""After losing the election, he is now looking for a Rajya Sabha seat because he is addicted to a luxurious lifestyle. Vipassana is just an excuse, the real reason for his presence in Punjab is the turmoil in AAP's Punjab unit,"" Delhi BJP President Virendra Sachdeva alleged as he spoke to PTI Videos.Congress too stepped up its attack on AAP with Punjab leader of opposition Partap Singh Bajwa and other representatives alleging that Punjab's resources were being blatantly misused while AAP had no qualms in flaunting VVIP culture. They highlighted that when AAP formed a government in Punjab, Kejriwal and Mann said that those who demand security should leave politics.","Arvind Kejriwal is in Hoshiarpur in Punjab for a 10-day Vipassana meditation retreat.

NEW DELHI: AIADMK chief Edappadi K Palaniswami 's recent remark urging people to ""wait for six months"" when asked about a potential alliance with BJP has set off speculation of a tie-up with BJP ahead of next year's assembly polls.BJP, which contested Lok Sabha polls independently, polled 11.4 per cent votes - an impressive share in a territory which is not seen as hospitable for the party-but failed to win a single seat.More importantly, the failure to sew an alliance with AIADMK which remains strong, saw DMK along with Congress and other allies sweeping the 39 seats.The apprehension of a repeat appears to have led the party to revisit the issue, and this time the state chief, former IPS, K Annamalai, who was opposed to the idea of partnering AIADMK, is said to have mellowed down.Responding to Palaniswami's statement about state BJP, Annamalai echoed a similar sentiment, saying, ""For BJP too, no party is an enemy. Our goal is to defeat DMK.""Known for his 'barefoot penance"" protest against DMK rule and past criticisms of AIADMK icons, Annamalai has softened his stance toward the latter. ""There's enough time to decide on an AIADMK alliance... Let's see how it evolves in 2025,"" he told reporters in Dec 2024, a notable shift from his earlier hostility.Sources said that a partnership with film star Thalapathy Vijay, whose newly launched Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) party is not off the table.Palaniswami signaled flexibility on Tuesday, refraining from dismissing a renewed BJP alliance for 2026.","AIADMK chief Edappadi K Palaniswami's recent remark urging people to ""wait for six months"" when asked about a potential alliance with BJP has set off speculation of a tie-up.

'Anybody except Nitish Kumar'

NEW DELHI: Election strategist and Jan Suraaj Party chief Prashant Kishor on Wednesday made a major prediction about the upcoming state assembly election and whether Nitish Kumar will become the chief minister again. Dismissing any chance of Nitish Kumar's fifth consecutive term in office, Prashant Kishor said he won't become the chief minister no matter which alliance he becomes a part of. Kishor predicted that Nitish would contest the election with the NDA but then he may switch sides.Prashant Kishor who was expelled from JD(U) in 2020 made his chief minister prediction and said anybody except Nitish Kumar could be the chief minister after the November elections. ""You can take it from me in writing. If I am proven wrong, then I will give up my own political campaign,"" Kishor said addressing a press conference in the West Champaran district.""I challenge Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah to declare that Nitish Kumar will be the chief minister for a full five-year term after the elections (if the NDA comes to power). If they do so, the BJP will find it hard to win seats,"" Kishor said.""Nitish Kumar may try switching sides after it becomes clear to him that the BJP was not going to back him for another term in office. But the number of seats won by JD(U) would be so dismal that he would not get the top job, no matter which formation he joins,"" Kishor predicted as he has high hopes for his party this election.Recently, Prashant Kishor called Nitish Kumar ""physically tired and mentally tired"" as he predicted an abysmal result for the JD(U) in the election. ""Not me, but the late BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi had stated that Nitish Kumar suffers from a serious mental illness. I have been challenging him for long to spell out the names of ministers in his own cabinet, without looking at a piece of paper. He cannot tell the name of the district he is touring unless prompted by officials. It is unfortunate that with such a state of mind, he is ruling Bihar,"" Prashant Kishor earlier said.","Prashant Kishor said Nitish Kumar won't be the chief minister even if BJP-JD(U) wins the election.

I have only said the same thing that professors and academics have said about Aurangzeb. I have never said anything against the state's icons.""The issue echoed in UP with CM Yogi Adityanath saying, "" SP should remove him. Do they support his views?"" In the legislative council, Yogi asked SP to bring Azmi to UP and said ""UP knows well how to take care of such people.""Meanwhile, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav defended Azmi, saying, ""If some people think suspension can put a rein on the truth, then this is the childishness of their negative thinking.""In the legislative council, when Fadnavis was asked by LoP Ambadas Danve of Shiv Sena (UBT) why Azmi was not jailed for his remarks, he said the MLA from Mankhurd-Shivajinagar will be ""100 per cent"" put in jail.In the assembly, the resolution for Azmi's suspension was moved by state minister Chandrakant Patil, a day after the issue rocked both houses.legislature.""Azmi's statements, which were made within the premises of legislature, are divisive and an insult to Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj.

The ED has alleged SDPI to be the ""political front"" of PFI, which was banned by the Centre in Sept 2022 for being an ""unlawful association"". The SDPI, however, denies any such link and calls itself an independent outfit.Meanwhile, SDPI activists took out a protest march in Kozhikode against Faizy's arrest.
