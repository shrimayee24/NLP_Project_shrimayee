BJP Targets Mamata Banerjee Over ED Raid At I-PAC, Alleges Evidence Tampering

NEW DELHI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Monday moved the Supreme Court seeking directions for the registration of an FIR against West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banarjee, the DGP and the Kolkata police commissoner for ""obstructing probe, tampering with and destroying evidence in a multi-state money laundering case against I-PAC"".Asserting the requirement for an FIR, the anti-money laundering agency said ""protectors of law became party to a serious cognizable offence"" as they ""intimidated and threatened ED officers and snatched files and electronic evidence containing incriminating material.""The central probe agency also said it had approached the Calcutta high court for the CBI probe into the incident but ""the clout enjoyed by the CM and her supproters was used to create a ruckus in the courtroom forcing the judge to adjourn hearing"".The ED on Saturday moved the apex court alleging interference and obstruction by the Mamata Banerjee-led West Bengal government during search operations at the Kolkata headquarters of political consultancy firm Indian Political Action Committee(I-PAC) and the residence of its director Pratik Jain.Later, the state government filed a caveat seeking to be heard before any adverse order is passed.The Bengal government’s caveat was filed after the ED carried out searches on Thursday at I-PAC’s office and Jain’s residence as part of a money laundering probe linked to an alleged multi-crore rupee coal pilferage scam.A caveat allows a party to ensure that no order is issued without giving it an opportunity to present its case.The ED has alleged that chief minister Mamata Banerjee entered the raid locations and took away what it described as “key” evidence, including physical documents and electronic devices. Banerjee has rejected the allegations and accused the central agency of overreach.The entire controversy erupted after CM Mamata Banerjee rushed to the house of I-PAC director Pratik Jain amid the raid and accused the Centre of holding political vendetta, alleging that central agencies were being misused ahead of elections.Reacting sharply to the action, Banerjee questioned the role of the ED and Union home minister Amit Shah.She claimed that party documents and data were being seized under the pretext of investigations. She also alleged that voter names were being deleted in West Bengal during the ongoing Special Intensive Revision exercise, linking the moves to the election process.",The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Monday moved the Supreme Court seeking directions for the registration of an FIR against West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banarjee.
