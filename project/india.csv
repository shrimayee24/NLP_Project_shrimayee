Hathras stampede: No mention of Bhole Baba in chargesheet,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hathras-stampede-no-mention-of-bhole-baba-in-chargesheet/articleshow/113886518.cms,"SIT report also didn’t question Baba’s role in Hathras tragedy

AGRA: Police have submitted a 3,200-page chargesheet on the Hathras stampede which claimed 121 lives on July 2 and took place during a congregation organised by self-styled 'godman' Surajpal Singh alias Bhole Baba. The chargesheet names 11 accused, including two women, but does not mention Bhole Baba as an accused in the case.Defence lawyer AP Singh, representing the accused, said, ""The trial will commence once the court takes cognisance of the chargesheet.The next hearing is scheduled for Oct 4.""On Tuesday, 10 accused, including the main organiser and fundraiser of the event, Dev Prakash Madhukar, were brought from Aligarh district jail to Hathras district court as part of the legal process .An FIR was lodged in the matter on July 2 under BNS sections 105 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 110 (attempt to commit culpable homicide), 126(2) (wrongful restraint), 223 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by the public servant) and 238 (causing disappearance of evidence).Allahabad high court had in Sept granted conditional interim bail to the two accused women - Manju Devi and Manju Yadav - while the remaining nine accused continued to be in custody.Earlier, a special investigation team (SIT) had submitted a report on the deaths, leading to the suspension of six officials, including deputy superintendent of police (circle officer) of Sikandra Rao, Anand Kumar, sub-divisional magistrate Ravindra Kumar, tehsildar Sushil Kumar and two sub-inspectors - Manveer Singh and Brijesh Pandey - for ""negligence and dereliction of duty"". Interestingly, the SIT report did not raise any questions about the role of Bhole Baba.Govt agencies, including police, have attributed the tragedy to ""mismanagement"" by the organisers, highlighting that the crowd numbers exceeded 2.5 lakh, surpassing the permitted 80,000. Bhole Baba's lawyer also claimed that the stampede was triggered by ""some poisonous substance"" sprayed by ""some unidentified men"".On July 3, UP govt had formed a three-member judicial commission, headed by retired Allahabad high court judge Brijesh Kumar Srivastav, to investigate the case and explore the possibility of a ""conspiracy"" behind the stampede. The commission is yet to conclude its probe.","Police have submitted a 3,200-page chargesheet on the Hathras stampede which claimed 121 lives on July 2.

Bombay High Court: Bombay High Court Seeks Attorney General's Response on Sachin Waze's Bail Plea,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hc-issues-notice-to-attorney-general-of-india-on-sachin-wazes-release/articleshow/113886331.cms,"Mumbai: The Bombay high court on Tuesday issued a notice to the Attorney General on a petition filed by dismissed police officer Sachin Waze , who has filed a plea for his release on bail from jail and questioned the validity of certain legal provisions preventing it.""Since the constitutional validity of Section 306 (4)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Code is challenged, we issue notice to the Attorney General,"" said the HC division bench of Justices MS Sonak and Kamal Khata.The section provides that an accused granted pardon as an approver in a criminal case shall, unless he is already on bail, be detained in custody until the termination of the trial.Waze had filed a hand-written petition from Taloja Prison, where he is lodged as an undertrial accused in the planting of explosives near Antilia and for the subsequent murder of Mansukh Hiran. He is also accused of extorting money from hotel and bar establishments in Mumbai. His lawyer, Rounaik Naik, arguing before the bench on Oct 1, said he is challenging the very validity of the law on the grounds that it violates a citizen's fundamental right to liberty and equality. Naik said Waze is an approver in the restaurant and bars' extortion case.The HC posted the matter on Oct 11 when it will consider Waze's plea for interim bail . The HC also directed the State public prosecutor to submit a synopsis of arguments and a compilation of judgments that he may seek to rely on.Waze, dismissed from service, is facing terror charges under the stringent anti-terror law—Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. On February 25, 2021, an explosives-laden SUV was found near ‘Antilia' in south Mumbai. Hiran, who said he was in possession of the SUV before it was allegedly stolen, was found dead in a creek in neighbouring Thane on March 5, 2021.Waze is the main accused in the case along with a few more police officials and others, including a bookie, Naresh Gaur, accused of allegedly getting SIM cards illegally. Waze's case was that there is no material to even remotely indicate how, from whom, and where he had procured gelatine sticks or had placed the gelatine sticks sans detonators in the four-wheeler outside. He said the Bombay High Court has observed that there is a shoddy investigation in this regard.","Waze had filed a hand-written petition from Taloja Prison, where he is lodged as an undertrial accused in the planting of explosives near Antilia and for the subsequent murder of Mansukh Hiran.

Babloo Sharma , who had wandered off while playing and scampered onto a train that took him to Delhi at the age of 4, was traced to a children's home in the national capital - where he spent his childhood, trying to join the dots to find his way back to his small, rustic village in Bulandshahr.Back in 2002, Babloo had somehow ended up in the nearby Chola station while playing. He then followed people around and unknowingly boarded a Delhi-bound train. In Delhi, some Govt Railway Police ( GRP ) personnel found him and took him roaming aimlessly at the station, eventually taking him to a children's home. He could hardly remember anything about his village, Dhanaura, at that time. As he grew up, he desperately hoped to see his parents again some day.Babloo remained at the 'home' after adulthood and worked there - serving tea and water to visitors. He, however, could never completely forget his origins, often reminiscing about his village. But the memories were sketchy.As he interacted with them, he gradually opened up, sharing bits of his early life. The GRP once again came to his rescue. Six months ago, as they began piecing together Babloo's story, they were surprised to find a promising lead.Babloo, now 26, somehow recalling the name ""Dhanaura"" and mentioned it to them. This helped them narrow their search to three potential districts - Bulandshahr, Baghpat and Bijnor.A month ago, the village head's husband, Veerpal Singh, contacted the GRP team and confirmed a child had gone missing in 2002, and reached out to his family. He remembered Sukhdev's painful tale of his ""lost"" son, and soon reached out to the family.On Monday, Sukhdev, with other members of his family, travelled to Agra for the emotional reunion , and Babloo returned to Dhanaura with them on Tuesday.""It is so unreal. I still can't believe that I'm at home with my parents... I lost 22 years.

However, it was lower than the approximately 65.4% polling recorded in the 2014 assembly polls, excluding the four assembly seats that were then part of Ladakh, which is now a separate Union territory.The final turnout for Phase 3, based on EVM votes, was nearly 69.7%, showing only a slight rise over the figure put out by the Election Commission at 11.45 pm on Tuesday.Sources said this is due to a conscious effort by the EC to have district election officers update the voting turnout figures in its app, by the end of the polling day. With no repolls necessitated after scrutiny on Wednesday, the final polling percentage for phase 3 shows only a marginal rise.Among the three phases, phase 3 recorded the highest turnout, as compared to 61.4% in phase 1 and 57.3% in phase 2.A look at districtwise turnouts reveals that all 10 districts in the Jammu region witnessed higher polling than the 10 districts of Kashmir division .

"Congress, IUML attack Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan for 'giving communal twist' to gold smuggling",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-iuml-attack-kerala-cm-pinarayi-vijayan-for-giving-communal-twist-to-gold-smuggling/articleshow/113885521.cms,"KOZHIKODE: A statement purportedly misattributed to Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan about smuggled gold and hawala money entering the state's predominantly Muslim Malappuram district for ""anti-national"" activities snowballed on Wednesday into a full-blown political slugfest, with Congress alleging that narratives usually spun by the Sangh Parivar were now coming out of the Left's mouth.Vijayan's clarification on the context of his remarks about gold smuggling , published as part of a recent interview to an English newspaper, did little to stem the barrage of criticism coming his way. Indian Union Muslim League national general secretary and legislator P K Kunhalikutty termed it a ""deliberate"" act to malign Malappuram.Congress MLA and leader of the opposition V D Satheesan demanded to know if the LDF govt would sue the PR agency linked to the interview if the CM was indeed misquoted. Youth Congress filed a police complaint alleging ""incitement of hatred and violence"" over the controversy.Governor Arif M Khan said he would write to the CM, seeking an explanation for keeping his office in the dark about gold smuggling and hawala money seized in Malappuram being used to wage war against the state.The controversial interview quoted Vijayan as saying that 150kg of smuggled gold and hawala money totalling Rs 123 crore meant for ""anti-state"" and ""anti-national"" activities had been confiscated over the past five years in the district, where over 68% of the population is Muslim.CM Vijayan clarified on Tuesday that he did not make any remark blaming any particular district or religious community. He said at an event that the only occasion he spoke about this was at a presser, mentioning gold seizures at Karipur airport, which is in Malappuram.""It is a fact that 123.9kg of gold was seized in 156 instances at Karipur airport, constituting the majority of gold seized in the state. Additionally, Rs 87 crore out of the Rs 122 crore in hawala money confiscated in the state was in Malappuram,"" he said, flaying alleged attempts by some quarters to paint CPM as ""communal"".""I have had to give out all these details as attempts are part of an agenda to create misunderstanding among people and divide them along religious lines. Such efforts won't succeed.""The CM also hit out at Nilambur MLA PV Anvar, who recently quit LDF after levelling a litany of allegations against the CM. He accused Anvar of acting with an agenda and people of the state would realise the heinous attempts being made to inject religious hatred by creating misunderstanding.""The very section that he thinks would come to his side through such efforts would be the first to disown him. One should not think that they can rent out their tongue just because some communal forces are behind them, and they can portray CPM and its leaders as communal. That is wishful thinking,"" Vijayan added.Alluding to Anvar's allegations against police officers on gold seizures made outside Karipur airport, Vijayan asked why some people were feeling the heat when gold smugglers and hawala operatives were being nabbed.""Can anybody say that gold smuggling and hawala operations are patriotic acts and police should turn a blind eye to them? Police are acting on powers entrusted to them. I am not responding to issues raised recently with a special agenda, but we realise it is aimed at destroying the mechanism we have. It is easy to find out for whom this is being done and who is behind it,"" he said.Vijayan said CPM was not a party that took decisions based on someone's street rants and disparaging remarks. ""The party won't approve anything that is wrong, and no one should think that the party can be dragged into wrongdoings,"" he said. The CM, however, said the govt had taken the MLA's allegations seriously and directed the state police chief to look into them.""We have said that actions will be taken once the investigation is completed. But he (Anvar) came out with a different agenda,"" he added.","Vijayan's clarification on the context of his remarks about gold smuggling did little to stem the barrage of criticism coming his way.

He is survived by his wife, two daughters and a son.The Surankote constituency went to polls in the second phase on Sept 25.A prominent Pahari leader , Bukhari was associated with National Conference for more than four decades, before he quit the party in Feb 2022 due to differences with its leadership over scheduled tribe (ST) status for his community.In Feb this year, he joined BJP, giving the party a major boost ahead of Lok Sabha elections, following the Centre’s decision to add Pahari ethnic tribe, along with three other communities --- Paddaris, Kolis and Gadda Brahmins --- in J&K’s ST list. A bill to this effect passed in the Lok Sabha during the budget session enabled 10% reservation under the ST category, along with other benefits, for these communities.His sudden death is a setback for BJP, as Bukhari was also a revered spiritual leader known as “peer sahab” among the locals, and wielded significant influence in the Pahari community, which numbers around 12.5 lakh across Rajouri, Poonch, Baramulla and Kupwara districts.LG Manoj Sinha, BJP state chief Ravinder Raina, and former chief ministers Omar Abdullah of NC and Mehbooba Mufti of PDP, among others, expressed grief over Bukhari’s death.In a post on X, Sinha said the Pahari leader “will be remembered for his commitment to the welfare of people and uplift of weaker sections of society”, while Raina termed it “an irreparable loss for the whole society in Rajouri & Poonch”.","Syed Mushtaq Ahmed Bukhari died after suffering a heart attack on Wednesday morning.

He also reiterated that he ""will be in the NDA till Narendra Modi is my Prime Minister"".Paswan said the current BJP-NDA government has been sensitive to his concerns about Dalits, and cited the Centre's stand on creamy layer and lateral entry into bureaucracy as an example.Speculation about a potential rift between his party and the saffron party has been circulating for some time. However, the LJP leader has repeatedly dismissed these rumors outright. Just a month ago, he firmly denied them, asserting that he is ""inseparable"" from Prime Minister Narendra Modi.""My love for Narendra Modi is unshakeable. I am inseparable from him, for as long as he is Prime Minister"", he had said in an interview to news agency PTI.""As a matter of fact, my views always reflected the government's stand. A case in point is sending the Waqf Bill to the Joint Parliamentary Committee"".The LJP (RV) leader had said that he was willing to participate in the upcoming Bihar assembly elections as a partner of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) ""if the BJP so desires"", and downplayed the significance of his estranged uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras, who is also the president of the Rashtriya Lok Janshakti Party.Paswan, who had been the lone MP of LJP(RV) ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha polls secured all five seats his party contested in this year's parliamentary elections.","Chirag Paswan, an important ally in the NDA, raised eyebrows with his remark. He said he would easily give up his ministerial post if the Constitution or reservation were tampered with or if any injustice was done to people from deprived sections. Later, the LJP(RV) leader cleared the air on his remark, saying he was referring to the Congress-led UPA.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113851358,imgsize-41802,width-400,resizemode-4/113851358.jpg"

Are 3 senior Karnataka mantris jockeying for chief minister's chair?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/are-3-senior-karnataka-mantris-jockeying-for-chief-ministers-chair/articleshow/113884322.cms,"BENGALURU: Amid growing speculation in Karnataka over Siddaramaiah 's tenure as CM, senior ministers G Parameshwara , HC Mahadevappa, and Satish Jarkiholi met late Tuesday night, a gathering that has sparked speculation that these ministers could be lobbying for the top post.The meeting, which lasted for two hours at Mahadevappa's official residence, was their third in the past few months.Reports indicate that the ministers might be aiming to intensify their efforts to secure the CM post for a person from a SC/ST community should Siddaramaiah's departure become inevitable. Jarkiholi is an ST, while Parameshwara and Mahadevappa are SCs.However, a senior Congress functionary, said, ""The meeting was part of a larger effort to strategise for the future.""The call for a functionary from SC, ST communities to assume the CM's post has echoed in Congress for over a decade. With both communities rallying strongly behind the party during the 2023 assembly polls, these influential ministers believe the time is ripe to fulfil this demand.""Parameshwara and Jarkiholi have been nursing ambitions to become CM, which is why they are advocating for a ' Dalit CM '. Given the support of both communities, party high command might find it challenging to ignore their request. Their strategy is to secure at least the deputy CM's position if the high command selects someone else as CM,"" another Congress functionary said.Some observers view these meetings as a strategy to undermine deputy CM DK Shivakumar's aspirations to succeed Siddaramaiah. Reports suggest that a purported deal struck by the Congress high command in 2023 entailed a shared chief ministership between Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar for 30 months each.Jarkiholi, however, denied that the CM's position was a topic of discussion.","Senior ministers G Parameshwara, HC Mahadevappa, and Satish Jarkiholi met late Tuesday night.
