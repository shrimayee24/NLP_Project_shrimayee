Some of what happened earlier (during the BJP-led central government) like putting people behind bars without trial, and widening the gap between the rich and poor, are still continuing.

""When I was young, many of my uncles and cousins were put in jail without trial. We had hoped that India would be free from this. Congress is also to blame for the fact that this did not stop.

LS Speaker election: Did Congress avoid seeking division of votes due to TMC reluctance?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ls-speaker-election-did-congress-avoid-seeking-division-of-votes-due-to-tmc-reluctance/articleshow/111295467.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Congress-led opposition did not press for division of votes during the Speaker's election , a move that the party claimed was done in the interest of bipartisanship, but which left an impression that the change of tack was linked to Trinamool Congress 's reluctance on the issue.Major constituents of the INDIA bloc - SP, DMK, Shiv Sena (UBT), NCP-SP - moved motions proposing K Suresh's name for the top post, but TMC stayed away.When the motion proposed by the govt in favour of Om Birla was put to vote, the opposition benches allowed the election by a voice vote, foregoing voting.The Mamata Banerjee-led outfit had complained it was not consulted over the election and Suresh's name. When the opposition tried to persuade it, TMC said it will convey its decision on Wednesday morning, ahead of the Speaker's election. The decision to allow a voice vote, sources said, suggested that TMC did not give a favourable response to vote division. However, there was much confusion over the issue later.Congress came out clearly that it did not seek physical voting. AICC spokesman Jairam Ramesh said, ""INDIA alliance exercised the democratic right to propose K Suresh for the post of Speaker and a voice vote was taken. After that, INDIA could have pressed for vote division, but did not, because INDIA wanted a consensus to strengthen the spirit of cooperation which is so lacking in the actions of PM and NDA.""But TMC's Abhishek Banerjee and Kalyan Banerjee told reporters that several members had sought voting, but the pro-tem Speaker did not allow the division because the govt did not have the numbers to win the election.

PATNA: Sanjiv Mukhiya, the Nalanda horticulture college employee identified as one of the absconding perpetrators of the NEET-UG paper leak in Bihar , is a repeat offender with a network of collaborators that includes the arrested kingpin of a UP ""solver gang"", investigators revealed Wednesday.Mukhiya, it transpired, unofficially took time off from his job as a technical assistant at the state-run Noorsarai Horticulture College in Nalanda from May 6 to 14 and got himself admitted to a hospital. He went missing after word got out about his alleged role in the paper leak ahead of the May 5 test. Sources in the Economic Offences Unit said Mukhiya had links with Ravi Atri, who was jailed in Meerut after being arrested in April for the police constable recruitment exam paper leak.Officials at Noorsarai Horticulture College said Mukhiya didn't report for duty on the day of the NEET-UG test and has been marked as absent without authorised leave since.In his response to a notice from the college on May 18, he claimed to have been hospitalised on May 6 due to a sudden illness. He requested leave until June 5, totalling 31 days. The college wrote back with queries to which he was supposed to respond within three days.The institute's office superintendent Pranay Kumar Pankaj said, ""Mukhiya has been posted in the college for seven years. When we heard he was a suspect in the NEET-UG paper leak, we summoned him through another letter on June 20, but received no response."" Pankaj mentioned that an EOU team visited the campus for questioning.A senior EOU official said Mukhiya previously collaborated with Ranjit Don, the alleged mastermind of several paper leaks from the 1990s till early 2000. Mukhiya allegedly branched out after Ranjit joined politics. ""Mukhiya operated as a link between candidates' parents, middlemen, handlers and the solver gang.

"Business as usual? Modi 3.0 starts on winning note in Lok Sabha, but opposition makes its presence felt",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/business-as-usual-modi-3-0-starts-on-winning-note-in-lok-sabha-but-opposition-makes-its-presence-felt/articleshow/111293306.cms,"Election of Speaker

The Emergency attack

BJP stamp on government

Continuity vs Change

Balance on policy issues

Working with the 'Shehzada'

NEW DELHI: PM Modi-led NDA government on Wednesday won the first battle of numbers on the floor of 18th Lok Sabha as ruling NDA candidate Om Birla was re-elected Speaker with a voice vote. Opposition's INDIA bloc, despite all its posturing, did not press for division of votes - a candid admission of lack of numbers on their side.Ever since the results were declared on June 4, there have been talks of change in the character of the 18th Lok Sabha.AIMIM MP Asaduddin Owaisi reflected the opinion of many in the opposition camp when he said today that the ruing BJP will not be able to ""steamroll"" the opposition as the character of the House has changed in new Lok Sabha. With the BJP failing to secure a majority on its own, the number dynamics in the Lower House has indeed changed. Prime Minister Modi is now dependent on allies for the survival of his government. But has that made any perceptible change in the way Modi 3.0 has functioned since it took oath on June 9? Well, the answer is both ""yes"" and ""no.""The election of Om Birla as Speaker of Lok Sabha had the stamp of authority which was trademark of both Modi 1.0 and Modi 2.0. With the firm support of allies, the government did not let opposition dictate terms on Speaker's election and refused to enter into any negotiations over the choice of deputy speaker. While the opposition wanted a commitment on deputy speaker's post, the government sent out a clear message: ""First, you support Speaker's election, and after that, we can discuss about the Deputy Speaker."" The stalemate ensured an election for Lok Sabha Speaker - something that had happened only three times till now - in 1952, 1967, and 1976.The invoking of ""dark days of Emergency"" by Prime Minister Modi and other top NDA leaders ahead of Parliament session was another signature BJP strategy - seen several times in the last 10 years of NDA rule - to not just put the opposition under pressure but also to isolate Congress within the INDIA bloc. With the Congress and INDIA bloc leaders carrying forward their poll campaign of ""Save Constitution"" to put the BJP on the backfoot, saffron party's ""Emergency"" counter attack was a well-planned move to keep the narrative around Constitution but with a different take. With Speaker Om Birla joining the government in attacking Emergency, the opposition's hopes of any perceptible change in government's functioning due to reduced numbers - may remain just that.When PM Modi took oath for a record third term in office, the belief was that allies, especially Chandrababu Naidu's TDP and Nitish Kumar's JD(U) would walk away with plum portfolios in bargain for their crucial support to run Modi 3.0. There were also reports that TDP wanted the Speaker's post. However, that did not happen. The BJP has not yielded too much of space to allies and has kept almost all the important portfolios with itself.Modi 3.0 has been marked by continuity, unlike Modi 2.0 when change was perhaps the only constant. Prime Minister Modi has retained most of his top ministers and even his top officers. He has also not changed the portfolios of key ministers. The choice of Speaker also signalled this spirit of continuity. This is in contrast to 2019, when Prime Minister Modi had returned to power with an overwhelming majority of 303 seats, and his Cabinet and council of ministers saw several changes. In 2019, the BJP selected Om Birla as Speaker replacing Sumitra Mahajan who presided over Lok Sabha during Modi 1.0.And while the BJP imprint has been strong till now, the saffron party will have to tread a cautious path when it will come to policies of Modi 3.0. Even before the countours of government was finalised, allies went public with their reservations on the Agniveer scheme, which was a flagship policy of Modi 2.0. The caste census is another issue on which the allies would have a different perspective. During campaigning, the BJP had teared into the Congress over reservations given to Muslims in Karnataka. However, in TDP, the BJP has an ally which openly supports the idea and is all set to implement it in Andhra Pradesh.Prime Minister Modi may have avoided taking the name of Rahul Gandhi in the last 10 years and referred to the Congress leader as Shehzada. However, the changed number dynamics has now made the former Congress chief an integral part of government's functioning for the first time. We saw the first glimpse of this today when Rahul accompanied PM Modi to escort Om Birla to the Speaker's chair. Also, as leader of the opposition, Rahul Gandhi will be part of several parliamentary bodies and panels for key appointments that are headed by Prime Minister. Rahul may still not have a say in their functioning, but he will be privy to all the discussions.While the BJP wants to drive home the point that Modi 3.0 is firmly in the saddle and it is business as usual, just like the first two terms of the Prime Minister, the opposition knows that Modi government is now completely dependent on crucial support provided by two key allies. The upcoming Budget may see some incentives, extra grants or even a special category status for Chandrababu Naidu's Andhra Pradesh and Nitish Kumar's Bihar. For Naidu and Nitish, these perks would be of far greater importance than any possible leverage at Centre. As long as the BJP manages to keep the NDA intact, it can afford to ride roughshod over opposition and provide glimpses of the authority it wielded in the last 10 years.","PM Modi-led NDA government on Wednesday won the first battle of numbers on the floor of 18th Lok Sabha.

"Speaker moves resolution condemning Emergency, Congress finds itself isolated",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/speaker-moves-resolution-condemning-emergency-congress-finds-itself-isolated/articleshow/111295278.cms,"NEW DELHI: Proceedings of the new Lok Sabha got off on an interesting note with the resurgent Congress finding itself isolated over a motion moved by the newly-elected Speaker to condemn the Emergency clamped by the Indira Gandhi govt to silence protests.The resolution , marking the ""post-facto ratification"" by the Indira Gandhi Cabinet of the presidential proclamation issued late night to suspend democracy and civil rights, was supported by Congress's allies like SP, DMK and TMC, besides, of course, BJP and its allies.""Dictatorship was imposed on India by Indira Gandhi, India's democratic values were crushed and freedom of expression was strangled. During that dark period of Emergency, several people lost their lives at the hands of the dictatorial Congress government. Let's observe two minutes of silence in the memory of those dutiful and patriotic citizens of India,"" the resolution read by Speaker Om Birla in Lok Sabha, a few minutes after his re-election, said.""This House strongly condemns the decision to impose Emergency in the country in 1975. Along with this, we appreciate the determination of all those people who strongly opposed the Emergency, fought an unprecedented struggle and took the responsibility of protecting the democracy of India,"" he further said.The motion, mirroring PM Narendra Modi's condemnation of the Emergency on the inaugural day of the session, caught Congress unawares, splitting it not just from allies like SP and DMK whose leaders were victims of Emergency's excesses but also, surprisingly, TMC, a breakaway unit.When Birla started reading out the resolution that specifically named Indira Gandhi and Congress for the assault on ""Babasaheb Ambedkar's Constitution, illegal arrests, press censorship and other excesses"", only Congress MPs protested from the aisle while the rest of the opposition, including SP and TMC, remained seated. Congress's allies also joined in the two-minute silence urged by the speaker to express solidarity with the victims of Emergency and to ""remind the younger generation"" of what happened in the 21 months of the Emergency.Besides the embarrassment to Congress, the swift move was significant also in that it again indicated BJP's resolve to pay Congress back in the ""Constitution-in-danger"" coin that Rahul Gandhi effectively used during the election campaign, as well as its willingness to pick and widen gaps in the INDIA bloc.""This is the 50th anniversary of the Emergency. It is our collective duty to create awareness about all historic events. Awareness towards the Constitution will only strengthen when the young generation knows about democracy,"" Birla said, adding that post-facto ratification of Emergency was done by the cabinet on June 26 fifty years ago.Endorsing Birla for his resolution on the Emergency, Modi said on X, ""I am glad that the speaker strongly condemned the Emergency, highlighted the excesses committed during that time and also mentioned the manner in which democracy was strangled. It was also a wonderful gesture to stand in silence in honour of all those who suffered during those days.""The PM said Emergency was imposed 50 years ago but it was important for today's youth to know about it because it remained a fitting example of what happened when the Constitution was trampled, public opinion was stifled and institutions were destroyed.""The happenings during the Emergency exemplified what a dictatorship looks like,"" Modi said, a reassertion of what Birla said in the resolution and seen as a bid to deflate Congress's ""save democracy"" campaign.Later, parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju framed the issue as one between those who supported the atrocities during Emergency on the one hand and those who sympathised with those who resisted the ""imposition of dictatorship"".","Lok Sabha condemned the Emergency clamped by the Indira Gandhi govt to silence protests.

Birla, 62, was elected by voice vote .There were 13 sets of proposals in favour of Birla, the first moved by PM Modi and seconded by defence minister Rajnath Singh. Other proposers were drawn from among NDA partners and BJP's own, representing various castes.With Congress and its allies Shiv Sena (UBT), DMK, NCP and RSP proposing the candidature of Suresh amid strong indications of their desire to make it a play on his Dalit background, a contest - the first in almost five decades - seemed imminent.Trinamool Congress's decision not to propose Suresh in protest against Congress unilaterally declaring him a contender appeared to be the main reason for the latter not to seek a division of votes.An effort involving Congress’s K C Venugopal and DMK’s T R Baalu from the opposition side and Union ministers Rajnath Singh, Amit Shah and J P Nadda on Tuesday to evolve a consensus had failed with govt again turning down the demand that the deputy speaker be from the opposition.But Congress did not press for a vote, despite an attempt by Union minister for animal husbandry Rajiv Ranjan Singh ‘Lalan’ to bait them into seeking one, leading to the 62-year-old Birla being elected by voice vote.Modi congratulated Birla on his re-election and expressed confidence that he would guide parliamentarians and play a big role in the House to fulfil people’s expectations.After his election, Birla told members that there should be a new vision and resolve for the 18th Lok Sabha. He called for Lok Sabha to be a centre of creative thinking and new ideas, which would establish high levels of parliamentary traditions and dignity. Modi and parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju were joined by leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi in escorting Birla to the Speaker’s chair after his election, marking a moment of harmony.Birla got a second consecutive term, the fifth time that a Speaker will serve beyond the tenure of one Lok Sabha.It is also among the few occasions that an election became necessary for a post conventionally decided by consensus.Birla, who has risen through the ranks in BJP, is also a three-term former Rajasthan MLA.",Om Birla was re-elected Lok Sabha Speaker for a second consecutive term.

NEW DELHI: In a pushback to the opposition INDIA bloc's bid to corner it on the issue of the Consitution, BJP on Tuesday launched a massive campaign on the 49th anniversary of the Emergency imposed by ex-Prime Minister and Congress leader Indira Gandhi in 1975.Blunting the Congress's attack on the BJP on the issue of the Consitution, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, ""Those who imposed the Emergency have no right to profess their love for our Constitution "".Reacalling the days of Emergency, PM Modi launched a fierce broadside at the Congress and said the grand old party turned the country into ""jail"" and any person who disagreed with the then Congress government was ""tortured and harassed"".""Today is a day to pay homage to all those great men and women who resisted the Emergency. The #DarkDaysOfEmergency remind us of how the Congress Party subverted basic freedoms and trampled over the Constitution of India which every Indian respects greatly,"" PM wrote on X.""Just to cling on to power, the then Congress Government disregarded every democratic principle and made the nation into a jail. Any person who disagreed with the Congress was tortured and harassed. Socially regressive policies were unleashed to target the weakest sections"" he added.Hitting back at the Congress over the ""dictatorship"" and ""authoritarian"" charges, PM Modi said, ""These are the same people who imposed Article 356 (President's rule) on innumerable occasions"".""Those who imposed the Emergency have no right to profess their love for our Constitution. These are the same people who have imposed Article 356 on innumerable occasions, got a Bill to destroy press freedom, destroyed federalism and violated every aspect of the Constitution,"" the PM said.Carrying on the attack on the Congress, the PM said the party is hiding its ""disdain for the Constitution"" through its ""tokenism"".""The mindset which led to the imposition of the Emergency is very much alive among the same Party which imposed it. They hide their disdain for the Constitution through their tokenism but the people of India have seen through their antics and that is why they have rejected them time and again,"" PM Modi wrote.Union home minister Amit Shah in a blistering attack at the Congress said the Emergency is the biggest example of the opposition party's long history of killing democracy and harming it repeatedly.BJP chief JP Nadda said on X that those who claim to be the guardians of Indian democracy today had spared no efforts to suppress the voices raised in the defence of constitutional values.""During this period, those who today claim to be guardians of Indian democracy left no effort to suppress voices raised in defense of constitutional values,"" Nadda said.""I am proud that our Party belongs to that tradition which resisted the Emergency tooth and nail and worked to protect democracy,"" he added.Defence minister Rajnath Singh said the Emergency, imposed by the then-prime minister Indira Gandhi in 1975 before she lifted it in 1977 and called for elections, is a black chapter in Indian democracy which cannot be forgotten.Dictatorship and misuse of power were on brazen display during the period, he said on X, adding that it raises a big question mark on the commitment to democracy of several political parties.The BJP's piercing attack on the Congress comes amid a coordinated campaign by opposition parties to paint the government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as working against the Constitution.The Congress and other opposition members on Monday carried copies of the Constitution in Parliament as the first session of the 18th Lok Sabha began.","BJP launches massive campaign on the 49th anniversary of the Emergency imposed by ex-Prime Minister and Congress leader Indira Gandhi in 1975.

TMC MLAs on dharna as swearing-in delayed due to guv standoff,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/tmc-mlas-on-dharna-as-swearing-in-delayed-due-to-guv-standoff/articleshow/111295596.cms,"While the governor wants Reyat Hossain Sarkar and Sayantika Banerjee to take their oaths at Raj Bhavan, the MLAs have expressed their desire to be sworn in at the state assembly

KOLKATA: Newly elected Trinamool Congress MLAs Sayantika Banerjee and Reyat Hossain Sarkar staged a dharna on the steps of West Bengal assembly on Wednesday afternoon due to a delay in their swearing-in following a disagreement between the Raj Bhavan and them.

Governor C V Ananda Bose had invited actor-turned-politician Sayantika and Reyat - elected from Baranagar and Bhagwangola, respectively, in the recent bypolls - to take their oaths at Raj Bhavan on Wednesday. However, the MLAs had written to the governor, expressing their desire to take the oath in the state assembly. These letters remained unanswered and Bose departed for Delhi later in the day.

The new MLAs held placards reading ""Waiting for the arrival of Honourable Governor for Oath (sic)"" during their dharna. MLAs Madan Mitra and Nayana Das also joined the demonstration. Sayantika and Reyat plan to continue their protest Thursday.

Assembly speaker Biman Banerjee announced that the assembly would seek legal advice, as the governor had not delegated anyone to administer the oath to the new MLAs. The speaker also held a meeting with law minister Moloy Ghatak to discuss the issue and might write to the President to resolve the impasse.

This is seen as a result of ongoing rift between governor and Trinamool govt, which escalated after a former Raj Bhavan staffer accused Bose of molesting her.
