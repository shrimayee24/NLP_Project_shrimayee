He helped us. We convinced Trinamool people to do all this (level the allegations). They (the complainants) never said no, they did whatever we told them to do. He (Adhikari) had told us that if we could not do this, if we could not get the big shots (Trinamool seniors of the area) arrested, we would not be able to stand (survive) here,"" Koyal is heard saying. ""I had to do all this very smartly. We said it (the alleged rapes and torture) happened seven-eight months ago. We had to work hard,"" he adds.Trinamool, including party chief Mamata Banerjee and national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee, latched on to the video. The CM first took to X and then spoke at length at public meetings in Nadia's Chakdah and Taherpur on Saturday.""The sting shows how deep the rot is within BJP. In their hatred for Bengal's progressive thought and culture, the Bangla birodhis (the anti-Bengal brigade) orchestrated a conspiracy to defame our state at every possible level. Never before in the history of India has a ruling party in Delhi tried to malign an entire state and its people. History will witness how Bengal will rise in rage against Delhi's conspiratorial regime and ensure their bisarjan (defeat),"" she wrote on the X platform.Adhikari himself was more guarded in his initial response, opting not to say anything directly about its contents: ""I have not seen the video. I will find out whose voice it is and then speak on this matter."" Later on Saturday, he said truth could be ""twisted and a misleading version circulated"". ""But its shelf life is very, very short. Ultimately, truth prevails,"" he added. ""I will approach the CBI and seek a full probe so that the perpetrators are punished,"" Adhikari said.One of the first Sandeshkhali complainants and now BJP's candidate from Basirhat, Rekha Patra, called the video a Trinamool ""ploy"".""The video is fake, there is no truth in it. Koyal is a BJP man, he can never say all this,"" she said. But she also added that Trinamool Congress ""may have threatened Koyal to say all this"".The video shows BJP mandal president Gangadhar Koyal crediting Suvendu Adhikari for everything. “It was he (Adhikari) who controlled.... Why has the Sandeshkhali movement survived for so long? He is still holding on, that is why. No one else has the ability to sustain this movement for so long,” he says in the video. “Empty pockets (khali haat) canot do all this,” he replies when the interviewer asks him whether Adhikari sent mobile phones and money.Koyal is also heard saying some women backed off from making complaints because they were scared of going to police stations and of the investigations that would follow. The video shows a woman saying she backed out because she had not been instructed properly. BJP Sandeshkhali Block-I president Shanti Dolui is seen nodding in agreement with the interviewer when asked whether the pistols recovered by central agencies later were “planted”. The male interviewer remains unidentified throughout the video but, from the body language of Koyal and others, it appears they are comfortable with him and know him.“You scripted a good drama on Sandeshkhali,” CM Mamata Banerjee later said in Chakdah. “The fact has been unveiled. I have been telling you all for some time that this is a conspiracy and a BJP-scripted drama. I have heard of this expose from the media and have not seen it in detail myself but I will definitely see it,” she added, tying it up with the molestation allegations against governor C V Ananda Bose: “Centre’s representative, the honourable governor, have you seen what he has done, what he does with Raj Bhavan employees, calls girls and molests them?And then Modi spends the night there and leaves. The person who gives a big sandesh (message) on Sandeshkhali: why have you not given one sandesh to governor?”Koyal himself later called the “viral video a conspiracy and a plot”. “They have used technology to fake my voice. This is a ploy to defame me, my party, the mothers of Sandeshkhali and my leader (Adhikari),” he added.","The 33-minute video focuses on Sandeshkhali Block-II BJP mandal president Gangadhar Koyal.

This phase will see all seats in Gujarat, and parts of Chhattisgarh, Bihar, and Madhya Pradesh up for grabs.

More than 1,300 candidates, including approximately 120 women, are contesting in this phase.

Key candidates and seats

Notable contenders include Union ministers like Amit Shah in Gandhinagar, Jyotiraditya Scindia in Guna, Mansukh Mandaviya in Porbandar, Parshottam Rupala in Rajkot, Pralhad Joshi in Dharwad, and SP Singh Baghel in Agra.

Former Madhya Pradesh chief ministers Shivraj Singh Chouhan in Vidisha and Digvijaya Singh in Rajgarh have also entered the electoral arena this time.

The outcomes of former Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai in Haveri and Badruddin Ajmal in Dhubri will also be determined on May 7.

In this phase in Uttar Pradesh, several members of Mulayam Singh Yadav's family are also participating in the elections.

With the BJP winning Surat uncontested, 25 seats in Prime Minister Modi's home state of Gujarat will go to polls on May 7, along with 11 seats in Maharashtra, 10 seats in Uttar Pradesh, the remaining 14 out of 28 in Karnataka, seven in Chhattisgarh, eight in Madhya Pradesh, five in Bihar, four each in Assam and West Bengal, and all two in Goa.

The Union Territories of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu will also hold elections in the third phase, while voting for the Anantnag-Rajouri seat has been postponed to the sixth phase due to logistical issues.

In Maharashtra, a notable contest is underway in Baramati between Sharad Pawar's daughter Supriya Sule and Sunetra Pawar, the wife of Maharashtra Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar.

In Gujarat, BJP's Mukesh Dalal has already secured victory in Surat uncontested due to issues with the nomination of

Congress

' Nilesh Kumbhani.

In Madhya Pradesh, the BJP aims for a clean sweep among its 29 Lok Sabha seats. At a rally in Morena, Modi claimed Rajiv Gandhi abolished the inheritance tax to safeguard his inheritance from Indira Gandhi's death.

Campaigning heats up

Campainging in the run up to the third phase saw the BJP-led NDA and the INDIA bloc locked in fierce exchanges on

reservations

, terroris, Article 370; and sexual harassment allegations against JD(S) leader Prajwal Revanna, which has rocked Karnataka politics.

Prime Minister

Narendra Modi

, leading the BJP's charge, challenged the Congress to provide written assurance that they won't allocate reservations for Muslims among the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Classes.

In response, the Congress and its allies accused the BJP of attempting to alter the Constitution and abolish reservation policies. The main opposition party, which has pledged to eliminate the 50% cap on reservations, also demanded clarity from the BJP regarding its stance on the matter.

Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge, accompanied by party leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, emphasized issues related to social justice, unemployment, perceived injustice towards farmers, and alleged preferential treatment towards certain businessmen.

On the other hand, BJP leaders criticised the Congress regarding wealth redistribution and inheritance tax matters, accusing them of practicing appeasement politics.

Meanwhile, Rahul Gandhi reiterated the Congress' pledge to conduct a caste census and economic survey if they come into power.

The BJP also criticized the Congress for what they perceive as a failure to tackle ""anti-national activities,"" instances of 'Love Jihad,' and what they term as 'appeasement politics'.

They repeatedly mentioned incidents like the bomb blast at a cafe on March 1, the murder of Neha Hiremath on a college campus in Hubballi on April 18, and the chanting of pro-Pakistan slogans in the corridors of Vidhana Soudha on February 27.

The last day of campaigning also saw Gujarat chief minister Bhupendra Patel, BJP state unit president CR Paatil, and minister Harsh Sanghavi participate in motorcycle rallies.

The BJP faced backlash from the Kshatriya community over a remark made by Rupala in Rajkot.

The Aam Aadmi Party, contesting in Bhavnagar and Bharuch, organized rallies with Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann and a roadshow in Bharuch with Sunita Kejriwal, the wife of Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal.

Uttar Pradesh witnessed numerous roadshows and rallies in its 10 constituencies, with Mulayam Singh Yadav's family members contesting in Mainpuri, Firozabad, and Budaun.

During rallies, Amit Shah targeted Rahul Gandhi, suggesting the need for a 'Congress Dhoondho Yatra' after June 4. BJP leaders alleged that Congress and SP leaders did not attend the Ram Temple consecration ceremony in Ayodhya for fear of alienating their vote bank.

Samajwadi Party

president Akhilesh Yadav campaigned extensively, attacking the BJP over reservation and other issues.

Tejashwi Yadav campaigned extensively for the RJD in Bihar. Despite heavy rains in Assam, both ruling and opposition parties campaigned vigorously. The BJP highlighted development schemes, while opposition parties focused on citizenship, connectivity, and unemployment issues.

Congress leaders, including Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, also criticized the BJP over accusations of sexual harassment against Prajwal Revanna, who is the MP for Hassan and a leader of the JD(S), which is an ally of the BJP.

In response, BJP leader Amit Shah and others have questioned why the Congress-led government in Karnataka didn't take action against Revanna sooner. The JD(S) joined the BJP-led NDA coalition in September last year.

Prajwal Revanna, who is the grandson of former Prime Minister H D Deve Gowda and was the JD(S)-BJP alliance candidate from the Hassan seat, faced elections on April 26. Prajwal's father, H.D. Revanna, was arrested by a Special Investigation Team on Saturday in connection with a kidnapping case linked to allegations of sexual abuse against Prajwal, following the rejection of his anticipatory bail plea by a court.

PM Modi visits Ram temple

During his visit to Uttar Pradesh on the last day of campaigning on Sunday, Prime Minister Modi addressed two rallies and later visited the Ram temple in Ayodhya.

He criticised the ""dynastic politics"" of the Samajwadi Party and the Congress, stating that while the opposition alliance focuses on benefiting their own families, he and Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath are working for the betterment of the nation's future generations.

Highlighting that he and Yogi Adityanath do not have children, he emphasized that they are working for the children of the nation.","A total of 92 seats across 11 states and Union Territories will be going to the polls on May 7.

He likes making speeches during the campaign as it ""makes one think about what the country needs', he added.In the video, Rahul engages with Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge, asking about his likes and dislikes during the campaign.

With a population of nearly 500 from 96 families, and nearly 230 voters, the village is gearing up to vote for the Guwahati Lok Sabha seat on May 7.This, after many of them already cast their votes for the Shillong Lok Sabha seat on April 19, in the first phase.Interestingly, nearly 65 families in the village also hold voting rights in Meghalaya due to their proximity to the border. Living along the disputed Assam-Meghalaya border areas, these "" dual voters "" have been exercising their franchise in Assam for decades, even after the creation of Meghalaya in 1972. Despite the Meghalaya poll officials' stance against double voting, residents with valid identification proof from both states continue to participate in elections in both, a practice that authorities find challenging to prevent.Unlike the Langpih area along the disputed interstate border, where people conceal their ""dual voter identity"" due to historical conflicts, the situation in peaceful Ranibari is different, with residents openly exercising their voting rights in both states.Assam govt provides them electricity and has built the main road, while Meghalaya govt offers job cards under MGNREGA, water supply, and assistance for agriculture, among other benefits. Though not at a loss with support from both states, villagers of Ranibari seek a permanent resolution to their voting dilemma. Rangsha, acting as the spokesperson, expresses the community's desire for clarity and a solution to the dual voting issue. He questions the expectation to abstain from voting when authorities from both sides encourage participation.""When booth-level officers from both Assam and Meghalaya approached us, we went ahead and got voter ID cards issued by the respective district election officers. When the election authorities from both sides want us to vote, can we sit idle at home on election day,"" Rangsha says.

MUMBAI: Money and politics go hand in hand. Among Lok Sabha contenders from Mumbai, three are from Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Party ( SVPP ), a registered unrecognised political party that was investigated by the income-tax department two years ago along with 200 other such parties for indulging in tax evasion by collecting donations through banking channels from their clients and returning the amount in cash after deducting commissions.SVPP had no visible activity but had received a Rs 55.5 crore in donation when it was raided by tax officials in 2022, according to income-expense details submitted to the Election Commission that year. All three candidates of SVPP have shown nil income in poll affidavits; they do not own any vehicle, and two of them have submitted that they do not even have a house.TOI visited the residence of one of the candidates, 60-year-old Kamlesh Vyas, in a Borivali housing society. He was not at home, and his wife was unaware that he was contesting the election from Mumbai North constituency. None of the other residents in the society appeared to know anything either.Over the phone, Kamlesh said that he was not an expert to talk about the party's I-T case but would discuss his work afterwards. He did not call back.Apart from Kamlesh Vyas, 38-year-old Mahesh Sawant is Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Party’s candidate from Mumbai South Central, whereas 45-year-old Bhavani Chaudhary is the candidate from Mumbai North East.SVPP runs from a hole-in-the-wall photocopying centre in a chawl in Borivali East. Its founder, Dashrath Parikh, said all political parties are linked to “wrongdoing” of donations. He said, “We had four corporators in Gujarat and were trying to increase our vote share to fulfil the requirements under Representation of the People’s Act, 1951 and thus accept donations through electoral bonds.”He said the I-T cases are still pending and declined to comment further. “We spent lots of the money on party work, as travelling, purchasing flags, and other election-related activities require money,” Parikh said.The party told EC it spent the Rs 55.5 crore it received in 2022 on various activities, including Rs 10 crore on education, Rs 15 crore on food, Rs 16 crore on winter clothes, and Rs 11 crore on relief to poor.According to I-T sources, most such parties are allegedly formed in connivance with hawala operators, mainly for tax evasion. They collect money from clients of hawala operators as donation and then return the money to the respective client in cash after deducting their commission. Party leaders receive 0.01% of the total amount as commission. The hawala operator manages the accounts of these parties and collects their fee separately from the client. The clients avail up to 100% tax deduction on the donated amount under Representation of the People’s Act.","Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Party was investigated by the income-tax department two years ago along with 200 other such parties.

Goa churches

PANAJI: Probably for the first time in the history of Goa, special prayers were held during the ' Holy Hour ' on Friday and Sunday by churches and parishes asking Catholics in the state to vote Tuesday for ""responsible candidates"" who would uphold values ""enshrined in Constitution"". A priest even went to the extent of passing on this message during a funeral service in South Goa.The directive to hold special prayers came from the archbishop of Goa and Daman , Felipe Neri Cardinal Ferrao. ""This has been interpreted as a message to vote for Congress,"" said one observer. CM Pramod Sawant welcomed the church's message and said BJP, in the true sense, is a secular party. Catholics constitute nearly 25% of Goa's population and make up 2 lakh out of 6 lakh voters in South Goa. Two seats, Benaulim and Nuvem, have over 80% Christians.The directive to hold special prayers came from the archbishop of Goa and Daman, Felipe Neri Cardinal Ferrao. The prayers were held during the ‘Holy Hour’, a Catholic tradition of spending an hour in eucharistic adoration in the presence of the blessed sacrament.“It is the responsibility of every citizen to be fully involved in public and social life. We pray during this Holy Hour so that these elections take place in a disciplined manner, and we are able to elect a responsible candidate. To responsibly cast our votes, we need the prayers, which when made unitedly, hold strength,” states a part of the prayer that was read out prior to the commencement of the Holy Hour.No party or candidate has been named, but a collective understanding within the clergy about who to support has been drawn. The Church hasn’t always shared love for Congress and its candidates.In 2012, the message from the clergy was to vote against corruption. At the time, it meant vote for BJP as it was the primary opposition party between 2007-2012. BJP was then led by former CM Manohar Parrikar, who helped establish cordial ties between the Church and saffron party.Relations between BJP and the Church now no longer appear cordial, with Sawant telling TOI in an interview he has held meetings with several priests. “My photos with the priests may have not been circulated, but I have met everyone. I held closed-door meetings. Why should there be a fight between religion for politics and votes? I have made a request (for support),” he said.","Special prayers were held during the'Holy Hour' on Friday and Sunday by churches and parishes.

Police sources said the property belongs to Revanna’s personal assistant. The survivor was then brought to Bengaluru.The 47-year-old woman from Holenarsipura town had lodged a police complaint against Revanna and rajwal on April 28, accusing them of sexually harassing her and her daughter when they worked in the household between 2019 and 2022. She quit the job to work as a daily-wage labourer.The Holenarasipura Town police have registered a case against the father-son duo, charging them with sexual harassment and criminal intimidation, among other IPC sections.Prajwal, who is alleged to have fled to Europe on a diplomatic passport after the issue started snowballing into a scandal, is yet to return to India. State govt has requested the Centre to issue an Interpol blue corner notice against him.In his complaint, the survivor’s son alleged that she had been abducted from their house by a man called Satish Babu alias Babanna at Revanna’s behest to prevent her from testifying against Prajwal. Revanna’s advocate claimed that except for the reference in the statement of accused No. 2 (Satish Babu) that he had been sent by Revanna, there is no other material against the MLA in the FIR. However, special court for elected representatives judge Santosh Gajanan Bhat was not convinced and rejected the bail plea.As part of the ongoing probe, earlier in the day, SIT brought another survivor for spot mahazar (identification) at the Holenarasipura residence of Revanna.

While Hussain hails from Nagaon district, Ajmal is from Hojai, both in central Assam.""Ajmal claims only he can solve the problems of the minorities. People have given him three terms but he failed miserably with Dhubri remaining one of the most backward areas in the state,"" Hussain alleged.The AIUDF leader, however, countered the allegations saying that it was during his term as the MP that connectivity improved, Dhubri Medical College and Hospital was established and work for Dhubri-Phulbari Bridge started.He claimed that minorities suffered tremendously during the updation of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and it was due to his efforts that many members of the Muslim community found their names in the final list.""Most of the D-voters (where D stands for doubtful) are from the minority community, with many being from Dhubri, and we are trying our best to ensure that these issues are resolved at the earliest,"" he added.The AGP candidate, who labeled Ajmal and Hussain as ""outsiders who do not understand the needs of the people"", asserted, ""I, on the other hand, live among the people and am aware of what they want. I am confident that people will vote for the NDA this time.""","A total of 13 candidates are in the fray in the constituency, which will go to polls in the third phase on May 7.

ETAH: Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday said the BJP government waives industrialists' loans but has failed to waive off loans of farmers .The SP chief also said that farmers, youth and common people are voting against the BJP in the Lok Sabha elections.Addressing an election rally in Jalesar in Etah district, which comes under Agra Lok Sabha constituency, Akhilesh Yadav said that loans worth Rs 16 lakh crore of industrialists were waived off, but no help was given to the farmers.""No loan of farmers was waived off. The BJP government made such a policy under which loans of industrialists and businessmen who have taken loans of more than Rs 5 crore will be waived off.

""The prices of diesel, petrol, LPG, refined oil, pulses, salt, everything has increased. There was never this much inflation before. BJP made promises to the public but did not reduce inflation.“They made false promises to the farmers as well as the youth.

London Mayor to be announced

Britain's Labour Party urged Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to call a general election after his governing Conservative Party suffered heavy losses in local elections in England.The Tories lost around half the seats they contested. In contrast, Labour won councils that the party hasn't held for decades, regional mayorships, and a special election for the Blackpool South seat in parliament.""Here in Blackpool, a message has been sent directly to the prime minister,"" Labour leader Keir Starmer said.""This was directly to Rishi Sunak to say we are fed up with your decline, your chaos and your division and we want change,"" Starmer added.Sunak has the power to decide the general election date, but it must be held before January 28 next year at the latest.He struck a defiant note after the Conservative Ben Houchen won re-election as the mayor of the northern region of Tees Valley.""Come a general election, [voters] are going to stick with us too,"" Sunak said.The chairman of the Conservative Party, Richard Holden, said it had been ""a tough night.""National polls suggest Labour is 20 percentage points ahead of theConservatives in terms of general election choices.According to the BBC, if replicated in a nationwide contest, the initial tallies suggested Labour would win 34 percent of the vote, with the Tories trailing by nine points.Sky News' projection for a general election using the partial results would see Labour become the largest party but short of an overall majority.Results will continue to come in over the weekend, including the key mayoral contest in London, where Labour's Sadiq Khan hopes to be re-elected.Elsewhere, the centrist Liberal Democrats and the Green Party also made gains, as did Reform UK, which is trying to take voters from the Conservatives on the right.Yet there seems to be no apparent moves amongst Tories to replace Sunak, which at this point would barely be possible in time for an election campaign.Sunak has previously said he was eyeing a vote in the ""second half of 2024.""","Tories lose half the seats they contested in local elections in England.

Labour won control of councils in England that the party hasn’t held for decades and was successful in a special by-election for Parliament that, if repeated in the general election, would lead to one of the Conservatives’ biggest-ever defeats.Though the results overall, admittedly on a low turnout, make for grim reading for PM Rishi Sunak , he was able to breathe a sigh of relief when Conservative mayor of Tees Valley in the northeast of England was reelected, albeit with a depressed share of the vote.The victory of Ben Houchen , who ran a very personal campaign, may be enough to cushion Sunak from any revolt by Conservative lawmakers.For Keir Starmer , Labour Party leader, it’s generally been a stellar set of results, with the only real negative coming in some areas with large Muslim populations, such as Blackburn and Oldham, where the party’s candidates appear to have suffered as a result of the leadership’s pro-Israel stance in the conflict in Gaza.","Britain's governing Conservative Party suffered heavy losses in local election results Friday.

On one side is the saffron front of BJP , while on the other is INDIA bloc led by Congress . There is a third player, too, in the dance of democracy: Revolutionary Goans (RG). The regional outfit, buoyed by its success in the 2022 assembly elections, has made a debut in the parliamentary elections.The numbers are stacked in favour of BJP.In the 40-member House, BJP and its alliance partners have 33 MLAs, while Congress and its allies have six, with a lone RG MLA bringing up the total.BJP has persisted with its OBC face, five-time MP and Union minister Shripad Naik belonging to the dominant Bhandari community for the North Goa Lok Sabha constituency while both Congress and RG have played the time-tested card of having a Hindu — Ramakant Khalap and Manoj Parab, respectively — from the north and a Christian — Viriato Fernandes and Rubert Pereira — from the south.In North Goa, the two septuagenarians — Khalap (76) and Naik(71) — are pitched against each other after 25 years. But it is South Goa constituency where BJP has brought in a political greenhorn and woman candidate to take on Navy veteran and activist-turnedpolitician Capt Viriato Fernandes to wrest the seat from Congress.Pallavi Dempo — businesswoman from one of the oldest business families of Goa and the richest candidate in the ongoing general elections’ Phase 3, which is scheduled for May 7 — has a net worth of around Rs 1,400 crore. This is her first tryst with politics. For BJP, too, it is the first time the party has fielded a woman candidate from a Lok Sabha constituency in Goa.On the face of it, BJP seems to be comfortably placed in South Goa seat. After engineering the defection of eight of the 11 Congress MLAs soon after the 2022 assembly elections, BJP had effectively brought 15 of the 20 assembly segments under its sway.But beneath the veneer of high-decibel optimism, the party managers are concerned about the undercurrents of insecurity among “turncoat” MLAs, particularly those representing Christian dominated constituencies. Having won the seat only twice — in 1999 and 2014 — the saffron party knows that sometimes numbers alone are not enough.The underlying current of resentment and distrust against the party, a circular from the archbishop of Goa and Daman — Felipe Neri Cardinal Ferrao — to all parishes, priests and Catholics asking them to vote for secular candidates who would uphold values “enshrined in the Constitution”, and its inability to break into the Christian-dominated Salcete taluka have led to uneasiness in the BJP camp.In the 2019 polls, Salcete taluka with eight assembly constituencies alone gave Congress a lead of almost 50,000 votes leading to its candidate winning the south seat by a margin of around 10,000 votes. Though BJP has been able to restrict the combined opposition to four MLAs in Salcete, the party knows that the legislators turning saffron may not necessarily translate into more votes for it.BJP is aware that its vote share dropped 2.2 percentage points to 51.9% in 2019, while Congress’s touched 43.6%, a rise of 6.6 percentage points, and AAP picked up 3.1% of the votes. Now, with AAP and other motley parties becoming part of INDIA bloc, BJP is desperate to recover its lost vote share and push past the 55% mark to retain both seats comfortablyIn the north, Naik has been bat tling anti-incumbency, but what is in his favour is that BJP has 90% of the 20 assembly seats with it. While BJP is confident of retaining its seat, it wants to reverse the 1.1 percentage point dip in its vote share in 2019, and increase it beyond the current 57.1%. With MGP (Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party) by its side, as against last elections when it supported Congress, BJP finds itself in a comfortable position to give Naik a recordbreaking sixth consecutive term from North Goa.In the tiniest state, where politics of personalities trumps politics of parties, it is no wonder that parties look for cues from their central leaderships when it comes to Lok Sabha elections.Armed with PM Modi’s guarantee, a ‘double engine’ govt and Viksit Bharat as the slogan, BJP is also highlighting ‘nari shakti’ through its woman candidate. Congress has tried to frame the election in terms of “money power versus people’s power” and minorities’ fear under BJP rule, while focusing on local issues like the Mhadei diversion, coal handling, rail double tracking, and unemployment.As the two national parties slug it out in the “two-seater” state with 11.8 lakh voters, RG has tried to sneak in with its hyperlocal hyperbole. Playing on the sentiments of the people, RG has tried to evoke the loss of Goan identity and the struggle for survival of Goans.","BJP and its alliance partners have 33 MLAs, while Congress and its allies have six, with a lone RG MLA bringing up the total. While BJP is confident of retaining its seat, it wants to reverse the 1.1 percentage point dip in its vote share in 2019.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109868314,imgsize-70682,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/109868314.jpg"
