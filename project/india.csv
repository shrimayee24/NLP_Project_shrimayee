NEW DELHI: Congress on Friday took a swipe at Himanta Biswa Sarma after the Assam chief minister claimed that the minor children of a sitting Member of Parliament from the state are 'no longer citizens of India.'The statement was made on May 1 through his official social media account on X. ""I say this with full responsibility — the minor children of one Member of Parliament from Assam are no longer citizens of India. But this is just the beginning. There is much more yet to be revealed,"" Sarma wrote, without naming the MP.""Dear Himanta BS, Are you talking about Dr. S Jaishankar's two children? Or is it Piyush Goyal's children? Hardeep Singh Puri's or Sudha Murthy's? Be specific while making such big allegations against people in your own party,"" replied Congress.Sarma reportedly made these allegations against Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi . Earlier this week, Sarma questioned citizenship status of Gogoi's family members. He has been targetting Gogoi repeatedly, stating he would release evidence of the MP's alleged international visits to Pakistan and Nepal before September.Congress on Thursday filed police complaints against CM Sarma for his alleged derogatory remarks against women during the recent panchayat poll campaign. The police are, however, yet to register the FIRs and said they are investigating the complaints.Sarma, during panchayat election rallies, had mentioned a witness' statement from the report of the Justice (Retd) Biplab Kumar Sharma Commission on irregularities in the Assam Public Service Commission (APSC) examinations for 2013 and 2014, when the Congress was in power.He had said the witness' statement maintained that women ""had to adopt a wrong path"" to get jobs during the Congress regime.

Sharp judge-lawyer exchange of words in Chhattisgarh booze case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sharp-judge-lawyer-exchange-of-words-in-chhattisgarh-booze-case/articleshow/120834983.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Friday witnessed a sharp exchange of words between a bench headed by Justice Abhay S Oka and senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani after the lawyer alleged that Chhattisgarh govt's plea against former IAS officer Anil Tuteja was not being heard because of adjournments. The bench passed an order asking him to move the CJI for transfer of the case to another bench and reminded him that the govt itself had sought deferment of hearing on a few occasions.At the outset of hearing, Jethmalani told the bench that the state wanted custodial interrogation and pressed for an early hearing. The court, however, said the main case was still pending and hearing on vacation of interim order could be heard with it as the accused had already been directed to cooperate with the probe. Senior advocates Gopal Sankaranarayanan and Meenakshi Arora also briefed the court that the accused were appearing on every date.Jethmalani thereafter questioned the court's jurisdiction in granting interim relief and said ""this is not the province of the court"". Not accepting his submission, the bench said the court was not ""powerless"" to grant relief. ""If you are making grievances against the bench, then you can go before the Chief Justice. This is not the way to behave,"" the bench said.Countering Jethmalani's submission that the accused had sought adjournments, Sankaranarayanan challenged him to spell out the dates when hearing was deferred due to the accused and told the bench that the state itself had taken adjournment three times in the case.Jethmalani clarified that he was not making any allegation against the bench. ""Your lordships are misunderstanding what I said. I did not say anything about the bench. I pointed out the conduct of the parties,"" he added.The court, however, went on to pass an order allowing the state to ask the CJI to transfer the case to another bench. ""If we start adopting this approach - which advocate has taken adjournment how many times - it will be impossible for us to function,"" the bench told Jethmalani.A bench headed by Justice Oka had on April 15 granted Tuteja bail in a money laundering case arising out of the Chhattisgarh liquor scam, noting that Tuteja had been in custody for over a year and charges had not been framed against him and more than 30 prosecution witnesses were to be examined in the case.Based on allegations of ED 's ""high handedness"" and ""inhuman conduct"" in interrogating a person for almost 15 hours which went beyond midnight, SC had in Jan pulled up the agency and expressed concern over its approach in conducting probe.ED denied the charge and accused Tuteja of influencing witnesses with the help of Chhattisgarh Police and the ex-advocate general under the previous Congress govt. It also produced documents in support of its charge in a sealed envelope, which is said to have led to the transfer of an important judicial officer outside the state.",Senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani alleged that Chhattisgarh govt's plea against former IAS officer Anil Tuteja was not being heard because of adjournments.

The sight of Kerala's Leftist CM Pinarayi Vijayan and Congress MP Shashi Tharoor at an event linked to an Adani project would ""give several people sleepless nights"", PM Modi quipped on Friday at the inauguration of Vizhinjam Port , India's first dedicated transshipment hub, in Thiruvananthapuram. He also took a dig at Kerala CPM's stance on private investment.Referring to state ports minister VN Vasavan calling Adani “a partner”, PM Modi said, “See, a communist minister called a private investor a partner. This reflects the change happening in India.” “I want to tell the chief minister (Vijayan)…you are a strong pillar of the INDI alliance. Shashi Tharoor is also sitting here…,” Modi said, pausing in between to allow his words to be translated to Malayalam for the local audience.When the translator appeared to misinterpret the part about “sleepless nights” as a reference to “issues about Indian airlines”, the PM immediately caught on. “He couldn’t translate it properly. But the message has reached where it should,” Modi said.AICC general secretary KC Venugopal said Modi’s remarks about INDIA bloc and Lok Sabha leader of the opposition Rahul Gandhi — the PM didn’t mention him — were unbecoming of his position. “Let’s see who actually has sleepless nights. It seems the PM got carried away by the excitement of meeting his dearest friend, Adani,” said Venugopal, adding that CM Vijayan could have corrected the PM, but chose not to.Later, Vasavan clarified that he called Adani a partner because the industrialist executed the Vizhinjam Port project initiated by ex-Congress CM Oommen Chandy. “There’s no need to read too much into what I said. It’s a public-private partnership , and as long as the agreement is in place, Adani remains the project partner,” he said.The launch event was overshadowed by friction between CPM and Congress. State leader of the opposition VD Satheesan skipped the event, claiming he wasn’t properly invited. Congress functionaries were also upset that the state govt didn’t acknowledge ex-CM Chandy’s role in the project. They also pointed out the irony of CM Vijayan accusing Chandy of corruption when he was CPM state secretary.","PM Modi said the sight of Kerala's Leftist CM Pinarayi Vijayan and Congress MP Shashi Tharoor at an event linked to an Adani project would ""give several people sleepless nights"" He also took a dig at Kerala CPM's stance on private investment.
