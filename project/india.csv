HC, while denying him pre-arrest bail, said, “We have perused the probe papers and, the alleged conversation between Nikam and the complainant. There is a sufficient incriminating material against the applicant to connect him with the crime in question.”“This conduct of the applicant, prima facie, corroborates prosecution case. Considering overall facts and circumstances, I am not inclined to release the applicant on anticipatory bail,” said judge NR Borkar in his March 17 order.","Shaikh, during his stint as additional chief metropolitan magistrate at Ballard Pier court, was involved in a road accident in 2022.

GUWAHATI: With four arrests so far, the Assam Police SIT escalating charges from negligence to potential murder, and international cooperation underway, Zubeen Garg’s death is no longer just about a tragic accident, it is evolving into a multi-jurisdictional criminal investigation.Gauhati HC has now agreed to state govt’s request to form a judicial commission head ed by a sitting HC judge. Assam CM Himanta Sarma said the judicial panel, to be headed by Justice Soumitra Saikia, will be formed on Saturday. ED and I-T dept are likely to join the probe into alleged financial crimes linked to Shyamkanu Mahanta, the arrested chief organiser of North East India Festival in Singapore where Zubeen was scheduled to perform.Over 60 FIRs have been filed across Assam demanding justice. Fans and civil society are pushing for transparency and accountability. Sarma Friday launched a counter-offensive against what he called a “coordinated conspiracy” to malign the govt using Zubeen’s legacy. “When he was alive, you didn’t invite him to perform in your areas. You brought Mumtaz from Bangladesh. ”Meanwhile, Zubeen’s drummer Shekhar Goswami & co-singer Amritprabha Mahanta, who were arrested by SIT Thursday, were sent to 14 days custody.","Assam CM Himanta Sarma said the judicial panel, to be headed by Justice Soumitra Saikia, will be formed on Saturday.

'No Confusion Regarding CM's Face' Tejashwi Yadav’s Sharp Reply on INDIA Bloc CM Candidate

A recalcitrant JDU legislator in poll-bound Bihar Friday joined RJD in what would be the first pre-poll defection by a sitting MLA this year. Sanjeev Kumar is JDU legislator from Parbatta in Khagaria district. RJD neta Tejashwi Yadav welcomed him into his party via videoconferencing as he was unable to attend the “Milan Samaroh” organised in Khagaria.For quite a while, Kumar has been at odds with his party. He recently organised a Brahmarshi conference in Patna to mobilise members of his Bhumihar caste. Tejashwi said Kumar’s entry would strengthen RJD and have an impact across the state.Despite being in the governing coalition, Kumar has openly criticised govt on matters such as farmers’ rights, land disputes and alleged irregularities in construction projects. JDU spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan Prasad said Kumar was the “main conspirator” in a previous failed bid to topple the Nitish Kumar govt.","Sanjeev Kumar is JDU legislator from Parbatta in Khagaria district.

NEW DELHI: The seat-sharing negotiations for upcoming assembly elections in Bihar have become more complex as two new parties - Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and Pashupati Paras's LJP faction - joined the Mahagathbandhan alliance. The situation is getting trickier as major parties are firm on their seat demands.The 243 seats will now be divided among eight parties -- Rashtriya Janata Dal, Congress, CPI, CPM, VIP, LJP (Paras) and JMM.“Two more parties are expected to be part of the INDIA bloc soon and we all have to sacrifice our share of seats to accommodate the new partners.” State Congress president Rajesh Kumar told reporters after a discussion during a key meeting of INDIA bloc leaders at the official residence of RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav.Meanwhile, Congress insist that it cannot go below the 70 seats.VIP chief Mukesh Sahani, on the other hand, has demanded “60 seats plus the post of deputy CM” while the CPI-ML is pressing for at least 40 seats, pointing to its past performance.The RJD is also unwilling to contest on fewer than 150 seats.In 2020 assembly elections, Rashtriya Janata Dal had contested on 144 seats, of which it won 75.Congress won 19 out of 70 seats.CPI-ML contested 19 seats and won 12.CPM contested 4 seats and was successful in winning 2 seats.CPI contested on 6 seats and won 2 seats.RJD's Tejashwi Yadav has already declared himself as the CM face of the opposition INDIA bloc.Addressing the rally in Ara town, the last stopover of the 'Voter Adhikar Yatra', Tejashwi questioned the Nitish Kumar government in Bihar for ""frequently copying his ideas"" and described it as a ""copycat government"". Ridiculing the government for copying his ideas, he said that at present he was moving ahead while the govt was behind him.""Tejashwi aage-aage, Sarkar pichhe-pichhe. Original CM chahiye ki duplicate?"" (Tejashwi is moving ahead while the govt is following him from behind. Do you want a duplicate CM or the original CM?), Tejashwi asked the crowd.","Two new parties - Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and Pashupati Paras's LJP faction - joined the Mahagathbandhan alliance.
