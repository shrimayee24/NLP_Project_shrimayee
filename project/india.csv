EC directs Jharkhand BJP to take down controversial social media post over poll code violation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ec-directs-jharkhand-bjp-to-take-down-controversial-social-media-post-for-poll-code-violation/articleshow/115392399.cms,"



NEW DELHI: The Election Commission on Sunday directed the Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) of Jharkhand to ensure the removal of the contentious post from the BJP's official social media platforms following complaints from the Congress and the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha.In addition to the takedown directive, the EC issued a notice to BJP Jharkhand, seeking an explanation for the alleged violation of the Model Code of Conduct (MCC). The CEO was instructed to expedite the removal of the objectionable content in coordination with the state's designated authority under Section 79(3)(b) of the IT Act.The video in question reportedly depicts a JMM supporter’s house adorned with party banners and a poster resembling Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren, bearing the caption: ""Pure Jharkhand ka kaya palat kardenge"" (We will completely transform Jharkhand). The footage then shows individuals from a specific community entering the house unannounced, allegedly with the intent of forcibly residing there.The INC and JMM have claimed that the video is riddled with baseless allegations and falsehoods, accusing BJP Jharkhand of attempting to influence voters by fomenting hatred and enmity against JMM leaders.The controversy in Jharkhand comes amid heightened scrutiny over MCC violations during the ongoing Assembly polls. On Saturday, the EC sought responses from BJP president JP Nadda and Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge regarding complaints against their respective star campaigners.The BJP has filed complaints against Rahul Gandhi, while the Congress has raised objections to remarks made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah during campaign speeches. Both party leaders have been asked to respond to the allegations by 1 pm on Monday, November 18, 2024.The EC reminded the party presidents of its advisory from May 2024 during the Lok Sabha elections, urging them to ensure that their star campaigners and leaders uphold public decorum and adhere to the MCC in letter and spirit.Jharkhand has completed voting for the first phase of its Assembly elections, covering 43 out of 81 seats. The remaining 38 seats, alongside Maharashtra's 288 constituencies, will go to the polls on November 20. The counting of votes for both states is scheduled for November 23.","The Election Commission issued a notice to BJP Jharkhand, seeking an explanation for the alleged violation of the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) The CEO was instructed to expedite the removal of the objectionable content in coordination with the state's designated authority under Section 79(3)(b) of the IT Act.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115392466,imgsize-1938296,width-400,resizemode-4/115392466.jpg"
"'Mess with anyone but me': Sharad Pawar vows to defeat Ajit faction in a ‘big’ way, urges voters to send strong message in upcoming elections",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mess-with-anyone-but-me-sharad-pawar-vows-to-defeat-ajit-faction-in-a-big-way-urges-voters-to-send-strong-message-in-upcoming-elections/articleshow/115390198.cms,"Sharad Pawar asks voters to defeat Ajit faction in a 'big' way.

NEW DELHI: At a rally in Solapur’s Madha, NCP (Sharad Pawar) supremo Sharad Pawar delivered a fiery message to his detractors, urging voters to decisively defeat those who rebelled under his nephew Ajit Pawar ’s leadership. Recounting a decades-old betrayal, the 83-year-old leader underscored his resilience and the importance of standing firm against political backstabbing.Pawar recalled an episode from 1980, when a defection within his party caused him to lose the post of Leader of Opposition in the Maharashtra Assembly . ""When I returned from abroad, I discovered that 52 of the 58 MLAs from my party had switched sides under then-Chief Minister AR Antulay. I lost my position as LoP,"" he said.Rather than react immediately, Pawar strategized. ""For three years, I traveled across the state and worked hard. In the next elections, I fielded young candidates against all 52 defectors . The people of Maharashtra ensured that all 52 were defeated,"" he stated.Addressing the crowd, Pawar emphasized the importance of teaching defectors a lesson. ""Don’t just defeat them—defeat them big,"" he urged, as supporters cheered loudly, completing his paused statement with chants of his name.The rally comes amidst heightened tensions within the NCP, which split in July 2023 after Ajit Pawar and eight MLAs aligned with the Shinde government. The Election Commission subsequently awarded Ajit Pawar’s faction the party name and ‘clock’ symbol, while Sharad Pawar’s faction was designated NCP (Sharadchandra Pawar) with the ‘man blowing tutari’ symbol.In a symbolic battle within the Pawar family, Sharad Pawar’s faction has fielded Yugendra Pawar, his grandnephew, against Ajit Pawar in Baramati. Ajit Pawar’s wife Sunetra Pawar also faced defeat in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, losing to sitting MP Supriya Sule, Sharad Pawar’s daughter.With Maharashtra’s political landscape in flux, Sharad Pawar’s rally set the tone for what promises to be a fierce electoral battle.","Sharad Pawar urges voters to decisively defeat those who rebelled under his nephew Ajit Pawar ’s leadership.

The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections , which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases. The results will be declared on November 23, along with Maharashtra.In the Tribal-dominated state, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and CM Hemant's Soren Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) are in a direct fight, while the Congress party and Lalu Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) are in alliance with the JMM.The JMM-Congress-RJD alliance are also reportedly seeking to deal with Left parties, Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party and other tribal outfits that have been contesting the elections in the state as independent entities and make efforts to field candidates against the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) on all 81 seats collectively.In the last assembly polls in 2019, the JMM-Congress-RJD alliance won a comfortable majority of 47 seats in a House of 81.The BJP slipped to 25 seats from 37 it held in 2014. The poor performance was perceived to be the outcome of its decision to contest alone backfiring. The party did not foster an alliance with the Ajsu in the 2019 polls when Raghubar Das, currently the Odisha governor, was serving the state as CM.In this year's Lok Sabha polls in Jharkhand, the BJP-led NDA secured nine out of the 14 seats, with the BJP winning eight and its alliance partner, the Ajsu (All Jharkhand Students Union) Party, retaining its single seat.On the other hand, the opposition India bloc improved its tally, increasing its seat count from two in 2019 to five in the parliamentary polls.BJP and JMM have spruced up their pace of campaigning from the ground zero to social media. BJP and JMM leaders are actively rebutting and challenging each other on a range of issues, including illegal immigration, youth welfare, employment and housing.INDIA bloc parties in Jharkhand slammed the EC for holding assembly elections in the state along with that of Maharashtra but claimed that they were ready to slug it out with BJP-led NDA, which has welcomed the announcement of poll dates.JMM, Congress, and CPI (ML-L) said the announcement showed that EC was in a hurry to conduct elections though the assembly tenure was due to end in January next year.Also, both the INDIA bloc and BJP-led NDA are expected to get into huddles to discuss the modalities of seat-sharing which is going to be a challenge for both the competing teams.","The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections, which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra. Elections in Maharashtra will be held in single phase on November 20. The counting of votes will be on November 23.Maharashtra is gearing up for elections as the two major political alliances—the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) and the Mahayuti—prepare to face each other for the first time in a Vidhan Sabha election.The Maha Vikas Aghadi, comprise of the Congress, the Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray), and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) under Sharad Pawar, will go head-to-head with the Mahayuti , which includes the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Shiv Sena faction led by Eknath Shinde, and the NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar. This will be the first electoral contest between these two alliances since the splits within the Shiv Sena and NCP.The MVA is hopeful of replicating its recent Lok Sabha success, while the Mahayuti aims to retain power by leveraging its populist schemes targeted at women and youth. Both alliances have set their sights on winning the state.Narayan Rane, a former Union Minister and the victor in the Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg Lok Sabha constituency, is poised to be a key figure for the BJP in the Konkan region during the forthcoming elections. Meanwhile, two constituencies are expected to be critical battlegrounds: chief minister Eknath Shinde's Kopri-Pachpakdi seat in Thane City and Worli in Mumbai, where Aaditya Thackeray, a leader of the Shiv Sena (UBT), is seeking reelection.In the last Vidhan Sabha elections in 2019, the BJP secured 26.1% of the votes, the Congress 16.1%, the NCP 16.9%, and the Shiv Sena 16.6%. The BJP and the Shiv Sena (then united) formed the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which secured a majority. However, the coalition soon crumbled due to disagreements over government formation, plunging the state into a political crisis.After no party could establish a government, Maharashtra was placed under President's rule. Devendra Fadnavis was briefly sworn in as chief minister, with Ajit Pawar as deputy chief minister. However, both resigned just days later before a scheduled floor test.By November 28, 2019, a new coalition emerged, with the Shiv Sena (Uddhav faction), NCP (Sharad Pawar faction), and Congress forming the Maha Vikas Aghadi government, led by Uddhav Thackeray as chief minister.The state's politics took another turn in June, 2022, when Uddhav Thackeray resigned following a rebellion within the Shiv Sena, led by Eknath Shinde, who then allied with the BJP. Eknath Shinde assumed the role of chief minister, with Devendra Fadnavis returning as deputy chief minister.",The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra. Elections in Maharashtra will be held in single phase on November 20. The counting of votes will be on November 23. This will be the first electoral contest between these two alliances since the splits within the Shiv Sena and NCP.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114248739,imgsize-47642,width-400,resizemode-4/114248739.jpg"
