SHIMLA: A day after Himachal Pradesh high court raised serious questions about an SIT probe under Shimla SP Sanjeev Gandhi and asked CBI to investigate state power corporation general manager Vimal Negi's mysterious death, Gandhi on Saturday attacked DGP Atul Verma for filing an ""ulteriorly motivated affidavit"" in the court in an alleged bid to insult him.Stating that he would rather resign than tolerate insults and questions about his professional integrity, Gandhi said he and members of the SIT had decided to challenge Friday's HC verdict with facts to expose the DGP's motives and how, he claimed, police headquarters had tried to implicate him.The SP said he has filed a petition in the HC seeking action against BJP MLA from Dharamshala Sudhir Sharma for allegedly circulating a video clip of the live-streaming of court proceedings in Negi's death case, held on May 21, without the court's permission. He claimed the MLA did this deliberately to malign his image since he is probing horse-trading allegations against Sharma and others in connection with last year's Rajya Sabha polls. He added that Sharma's action amounts to contempt of proceedings and violates copyright and information laws.In response, Sharma served a legal notice on Gandhi for claiming that he was the mastermind of last year's ""horse-trading"".Sharma told media that his name is not in the FIR pertaining to the alleged horse-trading, and that he was never called for investigation. He accused the Shimla SP of issuing misleading statements against him, asking what stopped police from filing a chargesheet against him if he was involved in horse-trading.Gandhi told reporters on Saturday that the SIT had carried out an honest investigation of Negi's death and that the DGP's status report in court was very irresponsible. He said he would soon expose how investigations conducted under him were being adversely impacted through what he alleged was a ""police headquarters and politico nexus"".He also announced plans to expose senior officers posted at police headquarters for holding a grudge against him. ""Someone wants an extension (service), someone wants posts, but Sanjeev Gandhi needs nothing except justice for Vimal Negi,"" the SP said.Gandhi claimed that the investigation revealed that a member of the DGP's staff has links with the Sanjay Bhuria gang, involved in drug trafficking.The SP also targeted former DGP Sanjay Kundu for allegedly hatching a conspiracy against him and projecting an LPG leak blast at an eatery in the city as an RDX blast through the National Security Guard (NSG) investigation.","Shimla SP Sanjeev Gandhi attacked DGP Atul Verma for filing an ""ulteriorly motivated affidavit"" in the court.
