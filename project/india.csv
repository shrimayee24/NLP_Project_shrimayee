NEW DELHI: As 22-year-old law student Sharmistha Panoli walked out of custody on interim bail granted by the Calcutta high court, her father, Prithviraj Panoli, acknowledged that even the family had disapproved of some of her social media posts.“She would show us some videos, even we did not like some videos and we would tell her that,” he said, adding that they had deleted some of them and had asked her to remove the one that ultimately led to her arrest. “This must have been a good lesson for her,” he said.The Calcutta high court on Thursday granted interim bail to Sharmistha Panoli, who was arrested for allegedly uploading a video that hurt religious sentiments. While legal proceedings are still underway, her father, Prithviraj Panoli, opened up emotionally about the arrest, her health, and their family's reaction to her online content.“I am very happy, no father wants his daughter to be in jail,” he said. “She has a kidney problem and Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is necessary for her to take medicines, but since we didn’t have the prescription, we couldn’t give her medicine in jail.This must have been a good lesson to her. She will do well from now on.”Sharmistha was arrested by Kolkata Police on May 30 from a hotel in Gurugram. The arrest stemmed from a video she posted regarding Operation Sindoor, which was deemed communal in nature. Though she had deleted the video and issued an apology on May 15, an FIR was lodged against her at the Garden Reach Police Station in Kolkata.Granting her bail, the court noted the complaint did not disclose any cognisable offence. The conditions for bail include surrendering her passport, cooperating with the investigation, and furnishing a personal bond of Rs 10,000. The court also directed that she be given police protection due to threats received after the video went viral.The arrest sparked wider political reactions, with BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari calling it “police overzealousness” and “a case of police atrocities”.","Sharmistha Panoli was arrested by Kolkata Police on May 30 from a hotel in Gurugram.

NEW DELHI: Expressing concern over misuse of Sec 498A of IPC that criminalises cruelty in matrimonial homes and dowry harassment, Supreme Court has quashed a case lodged 23 years ago by a Delhi Police woman sub-inspector against her husband, a colleague, and his entire family.Allowing the husband's appeal and quashing the case, a bench of justices B V Nagarathna and Satish C Sharma exercised SC's exclusive powers under Art 142 of the Con-stitution to quash the FIR lodged in 2002 at Malviya Nagar in Delhi and the charge sheet filed against the policeman, his parents and five sisters.""It is rather unfortunate that the complainant being an officer of the state has initiated criminal machinery in such a manner, where the aged parents-in-law, five sisters and one tailor have been arrayed as accused,"" it said.Writing the judgment, Justice Sharma said: ""Even if the allegations and the case of the prosecution is taken at face value, apart from the bald allegations without any specifics of time, date or place, there is no incriminating material found by the prosecution or rather produced by the complainant to substantiate the ingredients of 'cruelty' under Section 498A IPC."" The court said there were genuine cases of dowry harassment and cruelty in matrimonial homes but flagged the ""growing tendency to misuse legal provisions"" by women to rope in relatives of their husbands.The man and woman, both sub-inspectors in Delhi Police, had got married in Feb 1998 as per Buddhist rites. Alleging persistent torture for more dowry ever since the solemnisation of marriage, the woman lodged a police complaint in July 2002.

Bangladesh's Supreme Court on Sunday ordered the Election Commission to restore the right-wing Jamaat-e-Islami's party registration, nearly eight months after the interim govt lifted a ban on it, clearing the way for its participation in future elections.Court officials said the SC's appellate division, led by chief justice Syed Refaat Ahmed, directed the commission to restore the party's registration.The apex court said it was up to EC to decide if Jamaat could contest polls using its traditional ""scale"" symbol.EC scrapped the registration of Jamaat, which was opposed to Bangladesh's 1971 independence from Pakistan, in Dec 2018 in line with a HC ruling. In 2013, SC cancelled the registration of the Jamaat-e-Islami, saying the party is unfit to contest national elections.Former PM Sheikh Hasina's govt slapped a total ban on the party days ahead of her ouster on Aug 5, 2024 in a violent mass movement led by a platform called Students against Discrimination (SAD).Jamaat and several other parties had backed SAD.After Hasina's ouster, the party appealed for a review of the 2013 court order banning it.""Today concludes the decade-long legal battle. We hope Bangladesh will have a vibrant parliament after this verdict. We hope voters will vote for the Jamaat candidate of their choice now,"" one of Jamaat's leading counsels Mohammad Shishir Manir said.","Bangladesh's Supreme Court orders the Election Commission to restore the right- wing Jamaat-e-Islami's party registration.
