Mallikarjun Kharge cites RSS mouthpiece to attack PM Modi on Constitution,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mallikarjun-kharge-cites-rss-mouthpiece-to-attack-pm-modi-on-constitution/articleshow/111468721.cms,"NEW DELHI: Slamming PM Narendra Modi for attacking Congress on Constitution and Ambedkar, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge on Wednesday pointed out that RSS had opposed the Constitution ""in writing"" in 1950 and burnt effigies of Ambedkar and Nehru in the capital to lodge its protest against the statute.Congress also accused the PM of losing an opportunity to send out a message of unity to Manipur by refusing to allow Outer Manipur MP Alfred Arthur to speak for a minute ahead of his speech in Lok Sabha on Tuesday.Congress MPs Gaurav Gogoi and Praniti Shinde told reporters, ""The PM resorted to jokes and sarcasm, and old allegations, and degraded the political discourse, but refused to let a Manipur MP speak for a minute, which would have demonstrated sensitivity to the people of the state. This led to the northeast MPs' protest.""Shinde said the PM will not be given free passage in future also, and he will have to give respect to the opposition and show sensitivity, adding that he is responsible for the atrocities in Manipur and cannot escape accountability.After walking out of Rajya Sabha in protest against the PM's comments and the chair's refusal to give him a chance to clarify on Wednesday, Kharge said on X that in an editorial in Organiser magazine in 1949, RSS gave vent to its ideas regarding Manusmriti, saying ""in our Constitution, there is no mention of the unique constitutional developments in ancient Bharat. Manu's laws were written long before Lycurgus of Sparta or Solon of Persia. To this day laws as enunciated in the Manusmriti excite the admiration of the world and elicit spontaneous obedience and conformity. But to our constitutional pundits (read Ambedkar) that means nothing."" Kharge added RSS had protested against Ambedkar and Nehru.In contrast, Kharge said, Ambedkar had lavished praise on Congress for making him chairman of the Constitution drafting committee, ""despite more capable persons present in the constituent assembly for the job"" and had stated that Congress deserved the credit for the drafting of the Constitution.""Modi calls us opposed to Constitution and Ambedkar when history says that BJP, Jan Sangh and RSS are born opponents of the Constitution and Ambedkar,"" Kharge said outside Parliament, flanked by Sonia Gandhi, Sharad Pawar and the entire opposition bloc.The Congress president said he repeatedly sought permission from the Chair to clarify these facts in Rajya Sabha but was not given a chance, while the PM had himself intervened along with many ministers during Rahul Gandhi's speech in Lok Sabha.","Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge slams PM Narendra Modi for attacking Congress on Constitution and Ambedkar. Kharge points out that RSS had opposed the Constitution ""in writing"" in 1950. Congress also accused the PM of losing an opportunity to send out a message of unity to Manipur.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111468804,imgsize-65334,width-400,resizemode-4/111468804.jpg"

Change of guard in Jharkhand: Why Hemant Soren has moved fast to return as chief minister,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/change-of-guard-in-jharkhand-why-hemant-soren-has-moved-fast-to-return-as-chief-minister/articleshow/111466589.cms,"So, what was the hurry?

Why Jharkhand assembly elections are important for INDIA bloc?

JMM ahead in number games

NEW DELHI: The stage is set for JMM executive president Hemant Soren to return as Jharkhand chief minister ahead of assembly elections due in the state later this year. Champai Soren, an old party loyalist, who had taken over the reins of the state five months back after Hemant was arrested by ED in an alleged money laundering case, stepped down on Wednesday.In fact, there were indications of a change of guard in the state on Tuesday itself when all public programmes of Champai Soren had been cancelled.The sudden, though expected, move comes after JMM's allies - the Congress and the RJD - unanimously endorsed the return of Hemant Soren as the head of the ruling INDIA bloc. This despite the fact that the leadership change provides the BJP ammunition to paint the JMM as a family-oriented party. The BJP has slammed JMM for removing a senior tribal leader from the top post to pave way for the return of Hemant, who is the son of former Union minister Shibu Soren. Jharkhand BJP chief Babulal Marandi said the real face of JMM, which had talked about rising above nepotism and electing a new chief minister five months ago, has once again been exposed.Hemant Soren was granted bail by high court on June 28 and in less than a week he has set the stage for his return as the chief minister. Why did Hemant move fast to reclaim the top post?The ED case against Hemant Soren is still on and the probe agency has indicated that it will challenge the high court order granting relief to the JMM leader. News agency PTI, quoting sources, has reported that ED will file a SLP (Special Leave Petition) in the Supreme Court against the June 28 order passed by the single bench of Justice Rongon Mukhopadhyay of Jharkhand high court. The high court order not only granted him bail but also said “there was reason to believ"" that Soren was not guilty of the offence as alleged by the ED and there was no likelihood of the petitioner committing a similar offence.” Clearly, Soren wants to make a move before the probe agency plays the spoilsport.While Champai Soren has been an old party loyalist, the truth remains that he was perhaps not the first choice as Hemant's replacement. For the party that has never given the top post to anyone outside the family, appointing Champai was a compulsion at that point in time. Hemant's wife Kalpana, whose name then emerged as a strong contender for the top job, was not an MLA and did not have any political experience. Moreover, Shibu Soren, who had to decide on the replacement, also faced the dilemma of ignoring the political claims of his senior bahu Sita Soren, who has since left the party and is now with the BJP.However, things have changed in the last five months. Kalpana has established herself as a leader - leading the JMM Lok Sabha campaign effectively in the absence of Hemant Soren and improving the party's tally in the Lower House. If Hemant has to step down again, Kalpana would now be the natural choice for replacement. However, for that to happen, Hemant has to be in the saddle first.In fact, Kalpana's takeover may not be needed at all. In case of any such eventuality, Hemant Soren can follow into the footsteps of Delhi chief minister and AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal who has set the precedent of continuing as chief minister despite being in jail.Jharkhand goes to elections in four to five months and Hemant Soren would want to be the face of INDIA bloc in the state polls after missing out on most part of the Lok Sabha campaign following his arrest on January 31.In his first public rally after release from jail, Hemant Soren claimed that the BJP is planning to advance assembly elections in Jharkhand. Hemant Soren, who has accused the BJP of hatching a conspiracy to send him to jail, will now claim vindication of his stand of being innocent and the saffron party of being ""anti-Tribal"".JMM would be upbeat with the results of Lok Sabha elections. The party won three seats - Rajmahal, Dumka and Singhbhum, which is a gain of two seats from the 2019 elections. The party would hope to build on this success to make further gains in the assembly elections and consolidate the INDIA bloc against the BJP-led NDA.Unlike Maharashtra and Haryana, the two other NDA-ruled states which go to polls later this year, in Jharkhand the INDIA bloc has to defend its government. Clearly, the JMM-led ruling combine will have to fight anti-incumbency to retain power in Jharkhand.Five years back, the JMM despite performing poorly in Lok Sabha elections, did well in the assembly elections by unseating the BJP government of Raghubar Das.Hemant Soren has staked claim to form the next government and would be waiting for governor's invite to become chief minister of the state for the third time. The JMM-led alliance enjoys majority in the state assembly despite its numbers reducing to 45 MLAs – JMM-27, Congress-17 and RJD-1 after the Lok Sabha elections.Two JMM MLAs, Nalin Soren and Joba Majhi, are now parliamentarians, while Jama legislator Sita Soren resigned to contest the general elections on a BJP ticket. The JMM expelled two more legislators – Bishunpur MLA Chamra Linda and Boriyo MLA Lobin Hembrom – from the party.Likewise, the BJP's strength in the assembly has reduced to 24, as two of its MLAs – Dhulu Mahto (Baghmara) and Manish Jaiswal (Hazaribag) – are now MPs. The saffron party has expelled Mandu MLA Jaiprakash Bhai Patel after he joined the Congress to contest the polls.The current strength of the 81-member Jharkhand assembly is 76.(With inputs from agencies)","Champai Soren, an old party loyalist, who had taken over the reins of the state five months back after Hemant was arrested by ED, stepped down on Wednesday. The ED case against Hemant Soren is still on and the probe agency has indicated that it will challenge the high court order granting relief to the JMM leader.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111466470,imgsize-347314,width-400,resizemode-4/111466470.jpg"
"Opposition lacks courage to hear the truth, running away: PM Modi",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/opposition-lacks-courage-to-hear-the-truth-running-away-pm-modi/articleshow/111468720.cms,"NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Wednesday escalated his counter-offensive against the opposition and asserted that if the Lok Sabha polls were indeed a referendum on protection of the Constitution , then people considered NDA as more suitable for the job and said his opponents lacked the strength and courage to accept the fact of their defeat.As opposition members walked out during his reply to the debate on the motion of thanks on the President’s address, the PM said, “The country is watching.People who spread lies have no strength to hear the truth. They don’t have the courage to face the truth. They don’t even have the courage to listen to the replies to questions they raised during the discussion and can only run away. They are insulting the upper House and insulting its tradition.”Modi said the opposition had been defeated so convincingly that they had no option but to shout slogans on the streets. “Sloganeering, shouting and running away from the field are their destiny,” he said.The opposition walked out as Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar did not concede their demand to allow LoP Mallikarjun Kharge to intervene when the PM was speaking.Dhankhar lashed out at opposition MPs and Kharge and said he had given the LoP adequate time to speak without interruption. “Today, they did not leave the House, they left their dignity. Today, they did not show me their back, they showed it to the Constitution,” he said. Condemning their behaviour, Dhankhar said there could not be a greater insult to the Constitution than this.During the entire discussion on the President’s address, Constitution took the centrestage with both opposition and treasury benches raising the issue.Modi said the recent LS polls were not the first in which Constitution was in play. “Let me remind them that in the election of 1977, the only issue was to reinstate democracy and protect Constitution. That was the biggest election for protection of Constitution and people defeated the then govt. If this time it was an election to protect the Constitution, people have found us as able for that task and people have voted for us,” he said.The PM accused Congress of hypocrisy by recalling the 38th, 39th and 42nd amendments to the Constitution which sought to change the statute radically . He emphasised that through amendments Congress had sought to extend the term of Lok Sabha. ""You were elected in 1971 for five years but went on to occupy office until March 1977. Was that constitutional?"" he asked. Taking a dig at Sonia Gandhi-led National Advisory Council during the 10 years of UPA govt, Modi said this entity was placed over the PM. “Was it a constitutional post? You destroyed the office of PM. You remote controlled it,” he said.Modi also charged the Congress with putting “one family above all”, including the holders of constitutional offices.",The opposition walked out as Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar did not concede their demand to allow LoP Mallikarjun Kharge to intervene when the PM was speaking.

The CM’s bail application was rejected by the SC on May 22, when the apex court had observed that since a trial court had already taken cognisance of the chargesheet against him and rejected his application for regular bail, Soren should not have approached it for interim bail.Soren’s challenge to his arrest was also rejected by Jharkhand HC on May 3, after which he had approached the SC. His lawyer had sought interim relief to canvass for the Lok Sabha polls after the SC had granted interim bail to Arvind Kejriwal .After his first round of custodial interrogation, ED had claimed before a special court in Ranchi that while in custody, Soren was confronted with WhatsApp chats with other accused related to allegations of money laundering but he had refused to cooperate.

"Rishi Sunak, other PIOs at risk of losing their seats in UK election",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/rishi-sunak-other-pios-at-risk-of-losing-their-seats-in-uk-election/articleshow/111468337.cms,"LONDON: UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is expected to stay on as a backbench MP if his party does not win the general election, the results of which will be known on Friday. However there is a risk he could lose his seat, becoming the first serving PM to lose a general election and his seat at the same time.In 2019, Sunak (44) won the Richmond and Northallerton seat with a majority of 27,210 and 63% of the vote.Political consultancy electoral calculus gives the Tories a 50% chance of holding onto the seat and Labour a 47% chance of gaining it.No incumbent prime minister has ever lost their seat at a UK general election.There is speculation Sunak may return to working in the financial sector, whether or not he stays on as MP, and spend more time in California, where he has a home. Sunak has flatly denied he plans to quit as MP and move to California if he wins his seat but loses the election and vowed to continue to represent his Yorkshire constituents. If the Tories are the second-largest party Sunak will be leader of the opposition.A major survey for the Daily Telegraph by Savanta and Electoral Calculus last month suggested the Conservatives would be reduced to just 53 seats, their worse result in modern history, and Sunak himself would lose his constituency, which he has held since 2015 and where he is known as the “Maharajah of the Yorkshire Dales”.The study projects a gigantic 382-seat majority for Labour, with Labour winning a staggering 516 constituencies.A leadership election is likely to take place within the party even if Sunak keeps his seat. Priti Patel, Boris Johnson, David Cameron, Kemi Badenoch, and Suella Braverman are among those expected to stand. But Braverman and Patel are also in tight races for their seats.Three Indian-origin MPs, Shailesh Vara and Gagan Mohindra, both Tories, as well as Labour’s Thangam Debbonaire, are predicted to lose their seats at this election, according to Electoral Calculus.Other big Tory names whose seats are vulnerable include Jeremy Hunt, Liz Truss, James Cleverly and Penny Mordaunt.Pro-India Tory MPs Bob Blackman and Theresa Villiers who have consistently defended India in the House of Commons are also forecast to lose their seats.","UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is expected to stay on as a backbench MP if his party does not win the general election.

I have seen the work he carries out and he is good… I would prefer the Conservatives to win as they will handle the economy better. I don’t think criticism of Rishi Sunak is justified but I feel Sunak could have focused more on generating jobs and manufacturing.”Hirdesh Gupta (42), an IT professional who moved to the UK from UP seven years ago, said: “People are looking at who is the best candidate in their seat and who will support us, even if Labour… In 2019 Corbyn was Labour leader and his views angered all Indians.

At least in the Labour manifesto they are saying the right things. The Tories are also tightening the screws on legal migration.
