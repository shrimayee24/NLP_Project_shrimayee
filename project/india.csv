"Amid Bengaluru stampede row, Siddaramaiah & DK Shivakumar summoned to Delhi",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amid-bengaluru-stampede-row-siddaramaiah-dk-shivakumar-summoned-to-delhi/articleshow/121737074.cms,"DCM Shivakumar and CM Siddaramaiah

BENGALURU: Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah and his deputy DK Shivakumar have been summoned to Delhi for a damage-control meeting Tuesday with Lok Sabha LoP Rahul Gandhi as continued outrage over the June 4 Bengaluru stampede that killed 11 RCB fans puts Congress - accused of playing pass-the-buck - on a sticky wicket.A bureaucrat in the CMO said Siddaramaiah, who maintains that the state govt didn't put a foot wrong, received what he described as ""a sudden call"" from the Congress brass. He and Shivakumar were asked to prepare a detailed briefing of the administration's response to the stampede outside Chinnaswamy Stadium ahead of IPL-winning RCB's victory parade, the official said. Congress's urgency to firm up a strategy to counter the storm comes a day after the opposition doubled down on its demand for political accountability, including a three-day special legislative session to discuss what led to the stampede.Sources said AICC's Karnataka minder, Randeep Singh Surjewala, will be with Rahul at the scheduled 11am meeting with Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar. The latter was in the national capital Monday for an official engagement, but returned to Bengaluru late evening. He will be back in Delhi in time for the meeting with the high command, the sources said. For now, the three distinct Congress camps in Karnataka led by Siddaramaiah, Shivakumar and state home minister G Parameshwar are speaking in one voice as a credibility crisis stares the party in the face. The state govt has been accused of making police the scapegoats after five senior cops, including the Bengaluru's former city police commissioner B Dayananda, were suspended the evening after the stampede.","Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah and his deputy DK Shivakumar have been summoned to Delhi for a damage-control meeting with Lok Sabha LoP Rahul Gandhi.

"Maoist politburo down to 4 members, central committee has just 14",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maoist-politburo-down-to-4-members-central-committee-has-just-14/articleshow/121737840.cms,"NEW DELHI: Just as Rome was not built in a day, the CPI (Maoist), once the source of Red terror across 10 states, wasn't rendered headless in a day, with its heavily depleted strength of around 300 armed cadres now scattered across the Dandakarenya region and a few other pockets, leaving the outfit in ""tatters"".It has taken several blows to chip away at the CPI (Maoist) top leadership, defined by two apex bodies, the politburo (PB) and the central committee (CC), before the Chhattisgarh Police eliminated the outfit's No. 1-Nambala Keshav Rao alias Basavaraju-with his entire protection team.Since 2005, 14 PB members have been arrested or killed or have died due to illnesses. This has shrunk the PB to just four active members-Muppalla Laxman Rao alias Ganpathy, Mallojula Venugopal alias Abhay, Thippiri Tirupathi alias Deoji, and Misir Besra.Sources indicated that either Abhay or Deoji, both from Telangana, may have take up Basavaraju's mantle, though there is no statement yet from CPI (Maoist) on the succession. Every PB member is part of the CC but not vice versa.The CC numbers too have dwindled, with 26 non-PB members lost since 2007 to arrests, surrenders and death by illness. It now has 14 active members, including the four PB leaders. A dozen CC members are currently in jail and three dead by disease.Four CC members have surrendered in Telangana and Maharashtra and seven neutralised since 2007, including four this year.Active CC members now include Kadari Satyanaryana Reddy, Chandranna, Modem Balakrishna, Ganesh Uike, Gajarla Ravi, Anal da, Madvi Hidma, K Ramachandra Reddy, Sujata and Malla Raja Reddy.""The command structure of the Maoists is now in tatters. Consistent intelligence-led operations and surrenders have left the organisation fragmented and disoriented,"" Bastar IGP Sundarraj P told TOI. ""In all, 300 armed cadres are hiding in scattered hideouts of Dandakarenya and few other pockets...The only options they have is to surrender or get eliminated,"" said the IGP.Though the CPI (Maoist) has lately issued several appeals for ceasefire and talks, no PB or CC leader has taken up forces' renewed offer to surrender, ""possibly due to ego,"" said another officer.Erosion of the PB started in 2005 with the arrest of Sushil Roy in West Bengal. Between 2008 and 2011, more PB members landed behind bars-Pramod Mishra in Ranchi in 2008 and again in 2022; Kobad Gandhy in Delhi in 2009, though he is now a free man; Amitabh Bagchi in Ranchi in 2009; and Jagdish Yadav in Gaya, Bihar, in 2011. Baccha Prasad Singh and Bansi Dhar Singh were apprehended in Kanpur in 2010. Jhantu Mukherjee and Narayan Sanyal were arrested in 2006 and 2011, respectively, but are now dead. Kattam Sudarshan died in Dandakarenya in 2023. PB members Cherkuri Rajkumar alias 'Azad' and Kishenji were killed in 2010-2011, while Arvindji succumbed to illness in Jharkhand in 2018. Prashant Bose alias Kishan da was arrested with his wife Sheela Marandi, a CC member, from Jharkhand in 2021.The biggest blow came with the elimination of CPI (Maoist) general secretary Basavaraju, a PB and CC member. The CC is now down to just 14 members, including 4 PB leaders. Among the CC members arrested are Mithilesh Mehta in 2007 and again in 2022; Vishnu in Mumbai in 2007; Moti Lal Soren in 2009 in Odisha; Pradeep Singla in 2009; Vijay Kumar Arya in 2011 and 2022 and Varanasi Subrahmanyam in Bihar in 2011. More recently, Sheela Marandi was picked up in 2021; B V Krishna Murthy in Kerala in 2022; Kanchan da in Assam in 2022; Sabyasachi Goswami in West Bengal in 2024; and Sanjay Deepak Rao in 2023 in Hyderabad.","CPI (Maoist) once source of Red terror across 10 states is now scattered across Dandakarenya region and a few other pockets.

Qadri is accused of regularly posting communal and inflammatory content online.Additionally, at least seven separate complaints have been lodged against Qadri, including one with the Lalbazar Cyber Cell. “We are verifying the social media content, and further legal action will follow,” an officer said. Qadri’s account on X has since been locked.Qadri had been “untraceable” since Sunday. His father, Saadaq Khan, alleged that a “witch hunt” had been launched against his son following Panoli’s arrest.He also claimed that Qadri’s accounts may have been hacked and denied any religious bias on his son’s part.“My son is secular.We’ve been receiving threats since Sharmistha’s arrest,” he said.Meanwhile, the Calcutta High Court granted interim bail to Sharmistha Panoli on Thursday.

NEW DELHI: After repeated attacks on the Election Commission by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi , the chief electoral officer of Maharashtra on Monday advised the Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha to download the voter rolls of the Maharashtra legislative elections from its website — ""free of cost"".Hours after Rahul asked the EC to specify the exact date by which it would furnish the voter rolls, the Commission said it maintains the practice of sharing the details with recognised political parties — first at the draft stage and again after finalisation.""Electoral Rolls are revised annually through a participatory exercise. During this annual exercise, the Electoral Rolls are shared, free of cost, with recognised political parties, including the INC — first at the draft stage and again after finalisation.

Even for earlier electoral rolls, a copy of the finalised Electoral Rolls is retained by the District Election Officer.Under Rule 33 of the Registration of Electors Rules, 1960, any person, including the INC, can apply to the concerned District Election Officer and obtain a copy of the retained Electoral Rolls on payment of the prescribed fee. The CEO, Maharashtra, reiterated this statutory position on 22nd May 2025 to a Hon’ble Member of Parliament from the INC who sought a copy of electoral rolls that had already been provided to the INC during revisions in 2009, 2014, 2019, and 2024,"" it added.Earlier, Rahul had asked the Election Commission to specify the exact date by which it would furnish the voter rolls of the Maharashtra and Haryana legislative elections.In a social media post on X, Rahul welcomed the EC’s decision and said, ""Good first step taken by EC to hand over voter rolls.""""Can the EC please announce the exact date by which this data will be handed over in a digital, machine-readable format?"" he asked.The Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha also shared a screenshot of a media report claiming that the EC had cleared the way for sharing electoral-roll data for Haryana and Maharashtra from 2009 to 2024, following an assurance it gave to the Delhi High Court earlier this year.This development came a day after Rahul, in an article, outlined a ""step-by-step manipulation"" of the 2024 Maharashtra Assembly elections.""My article shows how this happened, step by step: Step 1: Rig the panel for appointing the Election Commission.
