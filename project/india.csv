The Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party has made a formal request for 12 seats in the November 20 assembly elections and has already announced candidates for five constituencies.""5 candidates that we have declared are going to win. I cannot wait like the (Maha Vikas Aghadi) people are waiting for. Only 2 days are left. It is sad that those who are talking about forming the government are not distributing tickets. It is a big mistake of the Maha Vikas Aghadi to delay so much. I expressed my unhappiness to Pawar Sahab ( Sharad Pawar ). I told him that I have declared 5 candidates. If you give me an answer, it is fine otherwise I have 25 candidates ready, I will field them as Independents,"" Abu Azmi said.The MVA allies, which includes the Congress , Shiv Sena (UBT) and the NCP(SP) have announced to contest 85 seats each, which makes it 255 out of the 288 assembly seats in the state. The three allies are in the process of dividing another 16 seats. The rest 15 will be allocated to other INDIA bloc parties which includes Samajwadi Party, PWP, CPM, CPI, and AAP.The SP leader also targeted the Congress and accused the grand old party of backstabbing him twice in the past. ""I am scared because the Congress has betrayed me twice in the past. They kept me waiting till the last moment and eventually did not give us any seats.""He also slammed the Congress for delegating all decisions to Delhi. ""The Congress loses because they keep going to Delhi for every decision. Why can't the state Congress president be allowed to take decisions. This is an big mistake on their part. I am the state party chief and I take decisions for my party here,"" he said.Abu Azmi claimed that NCP-SP leader Sharad Pawar, who is one of the main architects of the MVA, had asked him to wait till tomorrow for a clear picture. ""Sharad Pawar is the tallest leader of the MVA. There is no one of his stature in any other MVA party. I will wait for his answer till tomorrow, or else I will field my candidates as Independents,"" the SP leader warned.Interestingly, even as the SP state chief is threatening MVA allies over seats, for Uttar Pradesh bypolls, Akhilesh Yadav has announced that all INDIA bloc candidates will contest on the Samajwadi Party's election symbol 'cycle'. Bypolls are being held in 9 UP assembly seats.Making the announcement on X, Yadav said, 'Baat seat ki nahi jeet ki hai' (It is not about seats but about winning).""Under this strategy, the joint candidates of 'India Bloc' will contest on all the nine seats on the Samajwadi Party's election symbol 'cycle'. Congress and the Samajwadi Party are united and standing shoulder to shoulder for a big victory. India Bloc is going to write a new chapter of victory in this by-election,"" Akhilesh said.He also asserted that the Samajwadi Party's strength has increased manifold with the support of the Congress party's top leadership and booth-level workers.""With this unprecedented cooperation and support, every worker of 'India Bloc' in all the nine assembly seats has been filled with new energy with the resolve to win. This is an election to save the country's Constitution, harmony and the honour of the PDA.

AAP: BJP ‘goons’ tried to attack Arvind Kejriwal; BJP denies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/aap-bjp-goons-tried-to-attack-arvind-kejriwal-bjp-denies/articleshow/114598784.cms,"NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party alleged that BJP “goons” tried to attack AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal on Friday evening during his padyatra in west Delhi’s Vikaspuri. BJP hit back, saying Kejriwal had not been attacked and it was the anger of residents building up as elections near. Delhi Police said they had not received any complaint and no video of the alleged incident had surfaced yet.“Knowing they can’t defeat Arvind Kejriwal in elections, BJP resorts to dirty tactics by threatening his life,” chief minister Atishi said. “First, BJP tried to harm him by withholding insulin in jail by arresting him in a fake case, and now, by launching a deadly assault.” Kejriwal enjoys Z-security cover. Other AAP functionaries, including Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and Saurabh Bharadwaj echoed the charges. A senior AAP functionary alleged that several BJP workers raised slogans against Kejriwal, tried to penetrate his security cover, and attacked him.Rubbishing AAP’s allegations, Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva said residents of Vikaspuri had turned up at the padyatra to complain about the supply of dirty water in the area, which was being projected by AAP functionaries as an attack on him.“When people complained of dirty water, Kejriwal got offended. After living in a palatial bungalow, his habit of walking in the streets has gone, and when people ask questions, AAP leaders are trying to project it as an attack,” he said. “You have looted the people of Delhi in the name of electricity, water, and buses.”South Delhi MP from BJP Kamaljeet Sehrawat said frustrated by the city’s deteriorating condition and corruption of AAP MLAs and councillors, Delhi residents are now taking to the streets to protest against Kejriwal. “This week, we even saw the MLAs of Matiala and Sangam Vihar being beaten by the public. Kejriwal should think about why this is happening,” she said.Kejriwal has faced attacks during campaigning in the past — in 2019, he was slapped by a man during a roadshow in Moti Nagar.AAP functionaries are currently undertaking padyatras in different assembly segments in the city in the run-up to the February 2025 polls. Former deputy CM Sisodia said BJP wants to eliminate Kejriwal by any means possible. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh said, “BJP must answer why they hate Arvind Kejriwal so much that they’re willing to attack him.”Bharadwaj said it was a “cowardly” attempt by BJP. “It was done because Kejriwal is going among the masses and is getting their love and affection. We want to make it clear that if Kejriwal faces any danger to his life or any harm is done to him, only BJP will be responsible for it,” he alleged.","Aam Aadmi Party alleged that BJP “goons’ tried to attack AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal.

MUMBAI: The Worli assembly seat in Mumbai is set to witness a big electoral bout with former Congress LS MP and currently Shiv Sena RS MP Milind Deora entering the fray against sitting MLA Aaditya Thackeray of the Shiv Sena (UBT).With Deora's entry and MNS's Sandeep Deshpande already having filed his nomination papers from the seat, the fight in fact will be a three-way one, just like in the neighbouring Mahim seat, where there is a Sena (Sada Sarvankar) vs Sena (UBT) (Mahesh Sawant) vs MNS (Amit Thackeray) fight.""CM Eknath Shinde believes that justice for Worli and Worlikars is long overdue. Together, we're paving the way forward and will share our vision soon. It's Worli now!"" Deora said in a post on X on Friday, indicating he has been picked for the seat.Though Worli hasn't appeared on Sena's declared list yet, a senior Sena functionary said Deora's name was final.Both BJP and Sena led by Eknath Shinde were keen on fighting the high-profile seat, but it has gone to Sena in the Mahayuti arrangement.Deora, son of late Congress politician Murli Deora, was Congress MP for two terms (from 2004 to 2014) from Mumbai South , the Lok Sabha seat under which the Worli assembly seat falls.Deora was earlier this year in the race for the Mumbai South Lok Sabha seat too, but it was given to Sena MLA Yamini Jadhav who lost to Sena's (UBT) Arvind Sawant. Deora, a former Congress MP and Union minister, quit Congress early this year and joined Sena and got a Rajya Sabha nomination. Worli is part of the Mumbai South Lok Sabha seat. Aaditya filed his nomination from Worli on Thursday.From BJP, Shaina NC had been campaigning in the constituency. However, Sena had said that this seat would be fought by their nominee. Sources said Shaina NC, who had indicated her willingness to contest on a Sena ticket, lost out on account of the BJP's internal conflict.Making his political debut in the 2019 assembly polls, Aaditya, who became the first member of the Thackeray family to contest an election, defeated his NCP rival Suresh Mane by a margin of over 70,000 votes.However, in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, the Sena (UBT) candidate Arvind Sawant got a lead of only 6,715 votes from the Worli seat .While Sena had for long not been able to identify any candidate from this seat, both CM Eknath Shinde and his son MP Dr Shrikant Shinde had remained focused on it and visited it frequently. In Sept, heating up the political atmosphere in Worli, Shrikant Shinde visited Worli as part of his 'jansamvad yatra.'In 2022, soon after the MVA government was toppled, Aaditya wrote an emotional letter to residents of his constituency on completing three years as MLA. In his letter, Aaditya had also taken a dig at the BJP, without naming the party, saying that every party now wants to spend time and money in his constituency as Worli had made enviable progress. Aaditya said that they (rival parties) too wanted to come to Worli now. In his letter, Aaditya had hit out at the CM Eknath Shinde-led faction for ""indulging in dirty politics and betrayal.""","Worli assembly seat in Mumbai set to witness a big electoral bout.

The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections , which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases. The results will be declared on November 23, along with Maharashtra.In the Tribal-dominated state, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and CM Hemant's Soren Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) are in a direct fight, while the Congress party and Lalu Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) are in alliance with the JMM.The JMM-Congress-RJD alliance are also reportedly seeking to deal with Left parties, Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party and other tribal outfits that have been contesting the elections in the state as independent entities and make efforts to field candidates against the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) on all 81 seats collectively.In the last assembly polls in 2019, the JMM-Congress-RJD alliance won a comfortable majority of 47 seats in a House of 81.The BJP slipped to 25 seats from 37 it held in 2014. The poor performance was perceived to be the outcome of its decision to contest alone backfiring. The party did not foster an alliance with the Ajsu in the 2019 polls when Raghubar Das, currently the Odisha governor, was serving the state as CM.In this year's Lok Sabha polls in Jharkhand, the BJP-led NDA secured nine out of the 14 seats, with the BJP winning eight and its alliance partner, the Ajsu (All Jharkhand Students Union) Party, retaining its single seat.On the other hand, the opposition India bloc improved its tally, increasing its seat count from two in 2019 to five in the parliamentary polls.BJP and JMM have spruced up their pace of campaigning from the ground zero to social media. BJP and JMM leaders are actively rebutting and challenging each other on a range of issues, including illegal immigration, youth welfare, employment and housing.INDIA bloc parties in Jharkhand slammed the EC for holding assembly elections in the state along with that of Maharashtra but claimed that they were ready to slug it out with BJP-led NDA, which has welcomed the announcement of poll dates.JMM, Congress, and CPI (ML-L) said the announcement showed that EC was in a hurry to conduct elections though the assembly tenure was due to end in January next year.Also, both the INDIA bloc and BJP-led NDA are expected to get into huddles to discuss the modalities of seat-sharing which is going to be a challenge for both the competing teams.","The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections, which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra. Elections in Maharashtra will be held in single phase on November 20. The counting of votes will be on November 23.Maharashtra is gearing up for elections as the two major political alliances—the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) and the Mahayuti—prepare to face each other for the first time in a Vidhan Sabha election.The Maha Vikas Aghadi, comprise of the Congress, the Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray), and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) under Sharad Pawar, will go head-to-head with the Mahayuti , which includes the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Shiv Sena faction led by Eknath Shinde, and the NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar. This will be the first electoral contest between these two alliances since the splits within the Shiv Sena and NCP.The MVA is hopeful of replicating its recent Lok Sabha success, while the Mahayuti aims to retain power by leveraging its populist schemes targeted at women and youth. Both alliances have set their sights on winning the state.Narayan Rane, a former Union Minister and the victor in the Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg Lok Sabha constituency, is poised to be a key figure for the BJP in the Konkan region during the forthcoming elections. Meanwhile, two constituencies are expected to be critical battlegrounds: chief minister Eknath Shinde's Kopri-Pachpakdi seat in Thane City and Worli in Mumbai, where Aaditya Thackeray, a leader of the Shiv Sena (UBT), is seeking reelection.In the last Vidhan Sabha elections in 2019, the BJP secured 26.1% of the votes, the Congress 16.1%, the NCP 16.9%, and the Shiv Sena 16.6%. The BJP and the Shiv Sena (then united) formed the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which secured a majority. However, the coalition soon crumbled due to disagreements over government formation, plunging the state into a political crisis.After no party could establish a government, Maharashtra was placed under President's rule. Devendra Fadnavis was briefly sworn in as chief minister, with Ajit Pawar as deputy chief minister. However, both resigned just days later before a scheduled floor test.By November 28, 2019, a new coalition emerged, with the Shiv Sena (Uddhav faction), NCP (Sharad Pawar faction), and Congress forming the Maha Vikas Aghadi government, led by Uddhav Thackeray as chief minister.The state's politics took another turn in June, 2022, when Uddhav Thackeray resigned following a rebellion within the Shiv Sena, led by Eknath Shinde, who then allied with the BJP. Eknath Shinde assumed the role of chief minister, with Devendra Fadnavis returning as deputy chief minister.",The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra.
