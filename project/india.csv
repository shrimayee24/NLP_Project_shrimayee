Rana Sanga row in Parliament leads to BJP-opposition clash,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rana-sanga-row-in-parliament-leads-to-bjp-opposition-clash/articleshow/119679209.cms,"New Delhi: The ongoing row over Rajput ruler Rana Sanga spilled over into Parliament on Friday, with governing BJP condemning the remark of SP Rajya Sabha member Ramji Lal Suman that Sanga had invited Babur to India, and the Samajwadis and Congress alleging that Suman and other Dalit and tribal representatives were being targeted in UP at the instance of BJP. While Lok Sabha witnessed a minor skirmish over the issue, the clash was protracted in Rajya Sabha.During zero hour in LS, Jaipur rural MP Rao Rajendra Singh called Sanga a synonym of valour and sought to condemn Suman’s statement but SP members led by Dharmendra Yadav protested. BJP MP Ravi Shankar Prasad said the nation would not tolerate insult to great warriors.Later, Dharmendra sought to raise an issue relating to a Muslim MP in the last LS but was refused permission.As soon as proceedings began in RS, slogan-shouting BJP members rose to their feet to demand an apology from Suman. Chairperson Jagdeep Dhankhar called Rana Sanga “a symbol of chivalry and patriotism,” and criticised Suman’s remarks.“Our problem is that because of technology whatever we expunge is expunged only in our record. Social media gives traction to it,” he said. Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju condemned Suman’s statement as an insult to the nation.Leader of opposition in RS Mallikarjun Kharge said Congress respected all patriots but condemned attacks on Suman’s house, while warning that such “anti-Dalit actions will not be tolerated”. This provoked BJP members, who accused Kharge of “unnecessarily bringing the caste and Dalit card into play”. Commerce minister Piyush Goyal criticised Kharge for trying to “give a caste twist” to the issue. Suman got up to speak but BJP MPs started shouting slogans, which led the chair to adjourn the proceedings till noon.Dharmendra later told TOI that he wanted to highlight that SC/ST/OBC and Muslims representatives are under attack from BJP. He said Danish Ali was insulted in the House by a BJP member in the 17th LS, and now Suman’s house was attacked in Agra while the UP chief minister was in the city. He said days earlier, Robertsganj MP Chhotelal, a tribal, was attacked by BJP workers during an official meeting in Chandauli.",BJP MP Ravi Shankar Prasad said the nation would not tolerate insult to great warriors.

If the report indicates something is wrong, the CJI can direct registration of FIR and recommend initiation of removal motion in Parliament. Otherwise, he can close the case,” the bench told Nedumpara, and added that it would be premature to even consider the PIL while the in-house inquiry was on.Nedumpara said everyone wanted to know why the law applicable to common man was not applied in case of the judge, why no FIR was registered, and why no arrest was made. But the bench persisted with its view and said, “Let the ongoing process be over.”Sources told TOI that Delhi Police had sought CJI Khanna’s permission for registration of an FIR. However, the CJI, it is learnt, chose the procedure laid down by the judgments of SC that warranted setting in motion an inquiry panel.The panel comprises chief justices of the HCs of Punjab & Haryana and Himachal Pradesh — Justices Sheel Nagu and G S Sandhawalia — and Karnataka HC’s Justice Anu Sivaraman. Sources said the inquiry panel is likely to submit its report by the end of the first week of April.Meanwhile, govt acted fast on the SC collegium’s March 24 recommendation to repatriate Justice Varma to Allahabad HC and notified his transfer on Friday. Immediately after the govt notified Justice Varma’s transfer, the CJI wrote to the Allahabad HC chief justice asking him not to assign the repatriated judge any judicial work.The collegium had recommended Justice Varma’s transfer to ensure that he does not remain in Delhi when the inquiry proceeds beyond his deposition before the panel. The committee will examine the call data records of Justice Varma’s phones with the help of experts.Govt on Friday also notified the repatriation of Justice C D Singh to Allahabad HC acting on a five-month-old recommendation of the collegium headed by CJI Khanna.
