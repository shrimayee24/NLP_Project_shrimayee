‘Attack On My Life’: Suvendu Adhikari Targets Mamata Banerjee, Levels Serious Allegation

NEW DELHI: BJP on Sunday dismissed West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee 's contention that her dramatic intervention in the ED raids at I-PAC premises in Kolkata was in her capacity as TMC president, and suggested that her compulsion to remove evidence linking "" coal scam "" proceeds to her party might be the real reason.BJP Lok Sabha member Ravi Shankar Prasad also hit out at the state govt for the alleged attack on its Bengal leader Suvendu Adhikari's convoy and said no FIR was registered despite BJP's complaint. He said BJP functionaries have often been at the receiving end of such violence, often in the presence of state police.Slamming Banerjee, he said she was seen clutching a specific green file, which was removed during ED raids, and shrugged off her assertion that the central agency was looking to steal her party's poll strategy, including the list of its probable candidates. ""Why did a CM have to personally retrieve a file during a raid? What specific incriminating evidence was in that green file? Names of coal scam beneficiaries, the TMC leaders involved, the route of the hawala money, or the list of officers who facilitated the smuggling,"" he asked.Prasad alleged that her ""desperation"" might be linked to the tunnelling of hawala money to fund her party's campaign in the last Goa assembly polls.",BJP Lok Sabha member Ravi Shankar Prasad also hit out at the state govt for the alleged attack on its Bengal leader Suvendu Adhikari's convoy.

Kerala MLA held in 3rd rape case; Congress washes hands of him,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kerala-mla-held-in-3rd-rape-case-cong-washes-hands-of-him/articleshow/126470332.cms,".

KOCHI/THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala Congress MLA Rahul Mamkootathil, 36, was arrested Sunday and remanded in judicial custody in a third rape case , capping a dramatic police operation following CM Pinarayi Vijayan's intervention.Police said the Palakkad MLA used his position to sexually abuse women. A court sent him to jail after Kerala police crime branch investigators said he could intimidate complainants, influence witnesses and destroy evidence.Congress on Sunday distanced itself from the MLA, with party senior K Muraleedharan saying Mamkootathil had been removed after the allegations surfaced. ""After that, he is no longer our responsibility, and the party is not answerable for anything,"" he said.The latest case stems from an alleged assault on a 31-year-old woman at a hotel in Thiruvalla on April 8, 2024. The arrest followed what police sources described as urgent directions from Vijayan after the complainant sent a voice message on Jan 8 expressing fear for her family. Police dropped plans to wait for her return from abroad for a magistrate's statement. The state police chief approved the operation around 8pm Saturday, and officers moved quickly to pre-empt a bail bid.Crime branch units in Kollam and Pathanamthitta registered a case and said Mamkootathil refused to unlock his phone. Police seized the device, conducted a potency exam, and collected blood for DNA testing. Officers arrested him at 12.30 am at a hotel in Palakkad, took him to Pathanamthitta's armed reserve camp for questioning, recorded the arrest at 7.30 am, and produced him in court.","Kerala Congress MLA Rahul Mamkootathil, 36, was arrested Sunday and remanded in judicial custody in a third rape case.

BMC Becomes Mega Battleground As Thackerays Reunite And Alliances Shift Ahead Of Civic Wars 2026

NAGPUR: Maharashtra govt's decision to credit Mukhyamantri-Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana instalments for Dec 2025 and Jan 2026 to beneficiaries' accounts on Jan 14, the eve of municipal polls, has become a flashpoint between BJP-led Mahayuti and opposition Congress.Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) moved state election commission (SEC), objecting to govt's decision to credit two months' instalments, totalling Rs 3,000, barely 24 hours before the civic polls. It termed the release plan a ""collective govt bribe"", accusing it of violating model code of conduct to influence over 1 crore women voters. The party urged the commission to direct govt to release the funds only after polling concludes.Revenue minister and Nagpur district guardian minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule on Sunday dismissed Congress's objections as political opportunism, asserting that women beneficiaries could not be held hostage to election schedules as the Ladki Bahin scheme predated the announcement of civic polls and had ""nothing to do with municipal elections"".""This is an ongoing welfare programme of the state govt. For polls in 29 civic bodies, women across the entire state cannot be deprived of their rightful benefits,"" he told a press conference, adding any attempt to stall payments would amount to discrimination against women.Bawankule accused Congress of hypocrisy and obstructionism. ""When this govt launched the scheme, Congress tried everything to stop it. Former MPCC president Nana Patole attempted to derail the scheme by encouraging a petition in the high court,"" he alleged.""With nearly 2.5 crore beneficiaries, stopping payments because of elections would cause real hardship. Welfare cannot be switched on and off for political convenience,"" Bawankule said.Nagpur BJP city president Dayashankar Tiwari called it an exposure of Congress's ""anti-women mindset"".","Mahar Maharashtra govt's decision to credit Mukhyamantri-Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana instalments for Dec 2025 and Jan 2026 to beneficiaries' accounts on Jan 14 has become a flashpoint between BJP-led Mahayuti and opposition Congress.

Devendra Fadnavis arrest ‘plot’: Maharashtra top cop pushed for case against ex-DGP Sanjay Pandey,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/devendra-fadnavis-arrest-plot-maharashtra-top-cop-pushed-for-case-against-ex-dgp-report-submitted-before-retirement/articleshow/126460999.cms,"





MUMBAI: Just four days before her retirement on Jan 3, former DGP Rashmi Shukla submitted a report to the state home department saying an offence should be registered against ex-DGP and former Mumbai police commissioner Sanjay Pandey, along with two other police officers, for conspiring to arrest Devendra Fadnavis, who was opposition leader, and Eknath Shinde, who was UD minister, during the tenure of the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) govt.An SIT was formed to probe the issue raised in the assembly by MLC Pravin Darekar, and it submitted its report to the govt. Shukla was asked to submit her opinion on the report. Pandey declined to comment.The SIT had investigated the allegation of a criminal conspiracy to implicate Fadnavis and Shinde in an urban land ceiling (ULC) certificates scam case. The scam pertained to builders who allegedly submitted bogus ULC certificates and were exempted from surrendering 5% excess land to govt. During the MVA govt’s tenure, Thane police investigated businessman Sanjay Punamia, who was in a dispute with his business partner Shaymsundar Agarwal, in the scam. Afterwards, Punamia had alleged he was pressured to give a statement against Fadnavis and Shinde in the ULC scam.Shukla suggested the govt register an FIR against Pandey and police officers Laxmikant Patil and Sardar Patil for criminal conspiracy, a public servant disobeying the law, fabricating false evidence, and threatening a person to give a false statement, for conspiring to implicate Fadnavis and Shinde in an old case registered in Thane in 2016.Laxmikant Patil, then DCP, crime, Thane, used a govt vehicle to visit Mantralaya, Vidhan Bhavan, the office of the DGP and Sahyadri guest house in Mumbai, but instead of mentioning the exact location of those offices, on his instructions, his drivers wrote only “Mumbai” in the vehicle’s log book, which created suspicion about his behaviour. It was alleged that Laxmikant Patil exerted pressure on the accused and witnesses.It was also stated that Shukla found that while Punamia was in police custody in a case registered in 2021 in Thane, Patil interrogated him regarding the ULC scam case and pressurised him to give a false statement that Fadnavis extorted money from builders in the ULC scam case.","Former DGP Rashmi Shukla submitted a report to the state home department.
