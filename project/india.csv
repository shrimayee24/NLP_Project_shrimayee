NEW DELHI: AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday responded to the Election Commission over the allegations he made against BJP government in Haryana of 'mixing poison in Yamuna water'. EC on Tuesday had served notice to Kejriwal, asking him to prove his claim to avoid legal troubles that could lead to three years of jail term.In a 14-page letter signed by him, addressed to Election Commission secretary BC Patra, Kejriwal claimed that, ""that the statement attributed to the undersigned was made in the context of an urgent and alarming public health crisis concerning the deteriorating quality of drinking water in Delhi, necessitating immediate institutional and governmental intervention.""Further asserting his claims, Kejriwal said, ""The alleged statements were made in furtherance of an imperative public duty to highlight the severe toxicity and contamination of raw water received from Haryana, which presents an imminent and direct threat to public health.""""The raw water received from Haryana recently is highly contaminated and extremely poisonous for human health. That the contamination levels in the raw water are so extreme that the Water Treatment Plants (WTPs) in Delhi are unable to process it to bring it within safe and permissible limits,"" the ex-Delhi CM added in his response.Amid his direct allegations against BJP, Kejriwal claimed that the statements are ""rooted solely in the public interest"". ""intention behind the said statement was to raise an important public issue about extremely toxicity raw water being supplied to Delhi and also to secure to the citizens of Delhi safe water for its consumption. The said statement by no stretch of imagination be termed as inciting enmity between different groups or prejudicial to national integration. On the contrary, the substance and purpose of these statements are rooted solely in the public interest, aimed at highlighting a legitimate civic concern that requires urgent institutional intervention,"" the letter read.Additionally, Kejriwal highlighted the serious health risks associated with elevated ammonia levels in water, noting specific conditions such as liver and kidney disorders, neurological complications, and encephalopathy.Kejriwal also addressed the concerns around his allegations lining up with the Delhi poll and thus breach the model code of conduct. ""Upon a careful examination of the facts, context, and legal provisions, it is respectfully submitted that the statement made by undersigned are fully protected under the constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech and expression, and no offence or any violation of Code of Conduct is committed by the undersigned, "" he claimed.He also mentioned against viewing his claims as an offence, as such an interpretation could establish a problematic pattern that would weaken the ability to hold states accountable. ""The political and constitutional implications of labeling an environmental and public health crisis as an electoral offence are profound and deeply concerning. If raising genuine public grievances—particularly concerning the basic necessity of clean drinking water—is curtailed on the pretext of election law violations, it would set a dangerous precedent of silencing dissent and obstructing democratic accountability,"" was also stated in the letter.As the row continues, Haryana CM Nayab Singh Saini refuted the accusations, earlier in the day, by taking a sip from the river in Delhi's Palla village. Kejriwal countered Saini's actions by claiming that he didn't actually drink but ""spat it out"".Kejriwal has also been summoned by Sonipat court on February 17 over these claims.","AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday responded to the Election Commission over the allegations he made against BJP government in Haryana.

NEW DELHI: The water dispute between Delhi and Haryana escalated on Wednesday as AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal claimed that Haryana Chief Minister Naib Singh Saini 's act of drinking Yamuna water was deceptive, suggesting he ""pretended"" and ""spat back the water"".This follows Kejriwal's earlier assertion on Tuesday that Haryana administration had ""poisoned"" Delhi's water supply, potentially endangering residents.During his visit to Yamuna's banks at Delhi's Palla village today, chief minister Saini countered Kejriwal's allegations by taking a sip from the river.However, sharing the video, Kejriwal claimed, ""Haryana Chief Minister Naib Singh Saini pretended to drink Yamuna water... and then spat the same water back into the Yamuna.""""When I said that Yamuna water could be dangerous for the lives of Delhiites due to ammonia contamination, they threatened to file an FIR against me. They want to make the people of Delhi drink the same poisonous water which they themselves cannot drink. I will never let this happen,"" he added.Meanwhile, Saini described Kejriwal's comments as ""unfortunate"" and accused him of attempting to generate public fear for political advantage. ""An unfortunate statement by Arvind Kejriwal was given to create fear in the minds of people for his political benefits,"" Saini told reporters.He elaborated, ""Today, I have come here to the banks of River Yamuna and took a sip of water from Yamuna. He said that the BJP Goverment of Haryana has poisoned the Yamuna River. He spoke about mass genocide.""""The water resource authority took samples from here and no poison was found in the water,"" he stated, whilst claiming that Arvind Kejriwal has ""lied all his life"".The dispute originated from Kejriwal's Monday statements accusing Haryana's administration of ""poisoning"" Delhi's Yamuna water supply, suggesting potential mass casualties.Kejriwal stated, ""If this water would have entered Delhi only to be mixed with the drinking water, many people would have died in Delhi. It would have caused mass genocide.""These accusations have prompted BJP criticism ahead of Delhi Assembly elections, scheduled for February 5, 2025.Prime Minister Modi also criticised Kejriwal's statements, saying, ""People of 'Aapda' say that people of Haryana mix poison in water sent to Delhi. This is not just an insult to Haryana but to all Indians. Ours is a country where providing drinking water is considered a good deed...Such fear of losing that they are saying anything. I am sure Delhi will teach a lesson to people who say such things. In aapda walon ki llutiya Yamuna mein hi doobegi. ""As the row continues, Sonipat court has issued summons to Kejriwal for February 17 over the remarks.The Delhi Assembly elections are set for February 5, with vote counting on February 8.

Desperation or calculated risk: What's behind Kejriwal's 'poisoned Yamuna water' remark?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/desperation-or-calculated-risk-whats-behind-kejriwals-poisoned-yamuna-water-remark/articleshow/117696673.cms,"Poll Do You Think the Allegations Against Haryana Are Justified?

NEW DELHI: "" Biological warfare "", ""mass murder"", ""water terrorism"", ""genocide"" ... Is Arvind Kejriwal 's ""poisoned Delhi's water"" salvo against BJP's Haryana government a sign of desperation or is it a calculated risk to alter the direction of Delhi campaign by deflecting attention from opposition's relentless attacks over allegations of corruption against him and his Aam Aadmi Party Kejriwal's all-out offensive against the BJP-led Haryana government - accusing it of poisoning Delhi's water - has taken the centrestage in Delhi's campaign with Prime Minister Narendra Modi leading the charge against the AAP chief.""A former CM has made malicious allegations against the people of Haryana. AAP-da people have become desperate due to the fear of defeat. Is Haryana different from Delhi? Don't they have children and relatives in Delhi? Will they mix poison for their own people?"" PM Modi said at a rally hitting out at Kejriwal.""Can anyone think that to poison Modi, Haryana BJP has mixed poison in water? What are you saying? It is in Indians' character to forgive mistakes but neither Delhi nor India forgives sins committed with ill-intention,"" the Prime Minister added.The Congress was also quick to join the charge with Rahul Gandhi throwing an open ""drink Yamuna water"" dare at Kejriwal. "" Five years ago, he (Kejriwal) had stated that he will take a bath in the Yamuna and drink its water. Five years have gone by and he did not do so. You have to drink dirty water but Kejriwal lives in 'sheesh mahal' which is worth crores and lies to you,"" the former Congress chief said at a rally.Haryana chief minister Nayab Singh Saini, who had earlier said that Kejriwal has lost his mental balance as he stares at imminent defeat in Delhi, went a step further and visited the banks of the Yamuna River in Delhi's Palla village and took a sip of water to counter the AAP chief's accusations. Saini accused Kejriwal of attempts to ""create fear in the minds of people"" for political gain.The Haryana government has announced to sue Kejriwal. ""Kejriwal has made an irresponsible statement spreading panic among the people of Delhi and Haryana. Haryana government is going to get a case registered against him before CJM Court in Sonipat under the Disaster Management Act's Sections 2 (D) and 54,"" Haryana's revenue and disaster management minister Vipul Goel said. The provision which Goel referred to regarding the Act pertains to anyone making or circulating a false alarm or warning as to disaster or its severity or magnitude, leading to panic.Not just the Haryana government, even the Election Commission of India has put the AAP chief on notice.On Tuesday, the EC had warned Kejriwal of the grave consequences he could face if he did not provide evidence to substantiate his allegations. The EC had asked Kejriwal to provide details of the nature and extent of the chemicals used for ""poisoning"" the Yamuna which could have killed people in large numbers, as claimed by the AAP chief. Kejriwal was also asked to share details of his claim that engineers of Delhi Jal Board had actually detected and prevented it on time.Kejriwal has replied to the Election Commission. In his 14-page response, Kejriwal has said that his Yamuna water remark was in context of public health crisis due to drinking water quality in Delhi.""The statements on Yamuna water were made to highlight severe toxicity, contamination of raw water received from Haryana,"" Kejriwal has written in his reply. ""Raw water received from Haryana recently was highly contaminated and extremely poisonous for human health,"" he added.Earlier, the AAP chief had said that he is not afraid of legal action and had asserted he would not let people die in Delhi because of the ""dirty, poisonous water"". ""They are threatening to file a case against me. They sent me to jail, will they hang me now?"" he asked.Kejriwal, who is now ready to play the martyr, would have surely anticipated much of these reactions before levelling such serious allegations against a neighbouring state government.So, why did he precipitate the matter? Was AAP on a sticky wicket over corruption allegations?Well, no one would have a definitive answer to that for now. But the BJP's continued offensive against its government coupled with the sharp attacks from the Congress also seems to have put AAP under pressure.AAP was definitely in the pole position to do well in the 2025 elections after decimating its political opponents not once, but twice in the last ten years. In 2015, AAP won 67 out of 70 Delhi assembly seats with a vote share of 54.3%. Five years later in 2020, AAP maintained its dominance winning 62 seats and polling 53.6% of votes.But Kejriwal's campaign for a hat trick of victories in Delhi has been marred by allegations of corruption that saw the AAP chief and most of his ministers go to jail. Kejriwal, who is out on bail, eventually resigned and handed over the reigns of his government to Atishi. Kejriwal, whose claim to fame was his simple and transparent politics, also faces charges of extravagance in renovating the CM's bungalow, referred to by opposition as the ""Sheesh Mahal."" Besides, AAP also faces anti-incumbency after being in power for 10 years on the trot.While the issue of corruption and governance may have put the AAP on the backfoot, the Yamuna water pitch has allowed the party to go aggressive even at the cost of some legal action. Kejriwal, who has claimed that he is raising the water issue for the safety of people of Delhi, would not mind playing the martyr.",Prime Minister Narendra Modi leads the charge against the AAP chief.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission on Tuesday issued a notice to former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal seeking facts and evidence to substantiate his allegation that Haryana had poisoned Yamuna waters released to Delhi, which he claimed could have caused “genocide” had the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) engineers not stopped the waters at Delhi border.Importantly, the poll panel reminded him of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) provisions against statements that cause enmity between groups, are prejudicial to national integration and create public mischief, all of which attract a maximum jail term of three years.This could mean that EC, in the event of lack of sufficient evidence backing Kejriwal’s allegations, may consider ordering a criminal case/FIR to be registered against him, invoking the aforesaid provisions of BNS as well as Section 123(4) of the Representation of the People Act (false statement being a corrupt practice). This would be in addition to likely action for violation of the model code of conduct.Stating that the allegations of an elected govt poisoning the Yamuna waters with an intention to kill the residents of Delhi and equating this with nuclear or biological war, coming from a leader of Kejriwal’s stature, are “extremely serious in nature and unprecedented”, the Election Commission asked the AAP national convener to reply to its notice by 8 pm on Wednesday, citing the “factual foundation” of his allegations, “especially when the veracity...is contested”. The notice cites the clarification of Delhi Jal Board, posted on X on Monday, denying Kejriwal’s poisoning claims as “false, misleading and factually incorrect”.“Being a very senior leader with vast administrative experience, you must definite have the evidence to substantiate such serious allegations....It is presumed that the Govt of NCT of Delhi must have officially taken up such a serious and grave issue of public health with the state govt of Haryana,” EC stated in its notice that followed separate complaints by the BJP and Congress.Stating that Kerjiwal’s allegations, if true, run the risk of “creating enmity between the regional groups, residents of neighbouring states, and threat of law and order situation due to actual or perceived shortage of non-availability of water during this time of the year”, EC drew his attention to BNS provisions including Section 196 (statements that promote enmity between groups), Section 197 (imputations prejudicial to national integration) and Section 353 (public mischief), all of which carry a maximum three-year jail term, fine or both.The EC also cited Section 123 (4) of the R P Act as well as model code provisions that restrain candidates and parties from activities that create hatred and tension between groups, as also from criticism of other parties based on unverified allegations or distortion.As regards the other complaint received from chief ministers of Delhi and Punjab about sharp increase in ammonia levels in Yamuna waters released by Haryana, which the former claimed had made it untreatable, leading to a water shortage and public health crisis, EC said it had already called for a report from Haryana govt and was dealing with the complaint separately after considering the inputs from Haryana govt.","The Election Commission has issued a notice to former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.
