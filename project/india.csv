NEW DELHI: Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) supremo Mayawati on Sunday accused the Bhartiya Janata Party ( BJP ) and Samajwadi Party ( SP ) of being ""hand in glove"" ahead of the November 13 bypolls for nine Assembly seats in Uttar Pradesh, where the BSP is contesting independently.In a press conference, Mayawati condemned the slogans of both parties, calling BJP's 'Batenge toh Katenge' and SP's 'Judenge toh Jeetenge' misleading and a diversion from real issues.Mayawati highlighted her tenure (2007-2012) as better for law and order compared to BJP and SP rule. She promoted her party with the slogan, ""BSP se Judenge toh Aage Badhenge, Surakshit Rahenge.""""Ever since the bypolls were announced and the BSP decided to go solo on all nine seats, the BJP-SP alliance has lost its sleep. Except for a couple of bypolls, BSP has not contested byelections here,"" Mayawati said at the presser.""They have so far been contesting elections with a mutual understanding, but now with the BSP contesting the bypolls, the troubles of their 'alliance' have increased,"" she added.Deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya responded by distancing BJP from the 'Batenge toh Katenge' slogan, asserting, ""We will not let the opposition succeed with its dirty game of calling ‘Batenge toh Katenge’ BJP’s slogan. Our party’s slogan is the one coined by our top leader Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which is ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’.""The slogan was first used by Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath in Agra in August and was later endorsed by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).Mayawati urged people not to be swayed by ""empty"" slogans, stating that BSP's rule was the best. She accused SP of allowing criminals to run the government during its tenure and suggested that SP was discreetly encouraging such elements to help them in the bypolls.Bypolls in Uttar Pradesh are scheduled for November 13, and votes will be counted on November 23.The contested seats are in Katehari, Karhal, Meerapur, Ghaziabad, Majhawan, Sishamau, Khair, Phulpur, and Kundarki. Eight seats fell vacant as their MLAs were elected to the Lok Sabha, while the Sishamau by-election resulted from the disqualification of SP MLA Irfan Solanki following a criminal conviction.In the 2022 Assembly elections, the SP won Sishamau, Katehari, Karhal, Milkipur, and Kundarki.

NEW DELHI: After facing backlash for allegedly referring to Shiv Sena candidate Shaina NC as "" imported maal "" in the upcoming Maharashtra assembly polls , UBT faction MP Arvind Sawant claimed on Friday that he did not mention Shaina's name and said that he is the true victim of defamation . His defence came after a police complaint filed by Shaina against him at Nagpada Police Station earlier in the day.Sawant clarified that his remark was aimed at outsiders not being suitable for the local context, emphasising that Shaina is a friend he respects.""I never mentioned her name. I only said that someone who is an outsider will not be able to work here. It’s their habit to create uproar,"" he told ANI.Sawant also targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi , accusing him of being an expert in falsehoods and referencing the alleged Rs 75,000 crore irrigation scam involving NCP leader Ajit Pawar, who became Maharashtra's deputy chief minister""The PM is an expert in lying,"" Sawant said, accusing the ruling party of trying to set a false narrative and deflect attention from their weak foundation.Defending his long political career and respect for women, Sawant said his opponents are trying to malign his reputation. ""They file defamation cases, yet it is they who are defaming me. I have always respected women,"" he said.""Shaina NC is my friend, she has worked for me, and I respect her... They are 'satta jihadi' people, as our leader Uddhav Thackeray says,"" he added.A case was registered against Sawant at Nagpada Police Station after Shaina NC's complaint over his ""imported maal"" remark. The case falls under sections 79 and 356(2) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS).The controversy began when Sawant allegedly referred to Shaina as ""imported maal,"" implying that newcomers from other parties would not be effective. In response, Shaina criticised Sawant and questioned his respect for women. She warned, ""Now you will be 'behaal' because you called a woman 'maal'.""Shaina condemned the ""objectification of women"" and noted Congress MLA Amin Patel's reaction to the comment. She contrasted this incident with women-empowerment initiatives by Maharashtra CM Eknath Shinde and the central government.""You will have to apologise at Nagpada police station. The 'Mahavinash Aghadi' will be 'behaal' November 20,"" she added.The Maharashtra Assembly election is scheduled for November 20, with vote counting set for November 23.","UBT faction MP Arvind Sawant claims he did not mention Shaina NC's name.

The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections , which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases. The results will be declared on November 23, along with Maharashtra.In the Tribal-dominated state, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and CM Hemant's Soren Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) are in a direct fight, while the Congress party and Lalu Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) are in alliance with the JMM.The JMM-Congress-RJD alliance are also reportedly seeking to deal with Left parties, Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party and other tribal outfits that have been contesting the elections in the state as independent entities and make efforts to field candidates against the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) on all 81 seats collectively.In the last assembly polls in 2019, the JMM-Congress-RJD alliance won a comfortable majority of 47 seats in a House of 81.The BJP slipped to 25 seats from 37 it held in 2014. The poor performance was perceived to be the outcome of its decision to contest alone backfiring. The party did not foster an alliance with the Ajsu in the 2019 polls when Raghubar Das, currently the Odisha governor, was serving the state as CM.In this year's Lok Sabha polls in Jharkhand, the BJP-led NDA secured nine out of the 14 seats, with the BJP winning eight and its alliance partner, the Ajsu (All Jharkhand Students Union) Party, retaining its single seat.On the other hand, the opposition India bloc improved its tally, increasing its seat count from two in 2019 to five in the parliamentary polls.BJP and JMM have spruced up their pace of campaigning from the ground zero to social media. BJP and JMM leaders are actively rebutting and challenging each other on a range of issues, including illegal immigration, youth welfare, employment and housing.INDIA bloc parties in Jharkhand slammed the EC for holding assembly elections in the state along with that of Maharashtra but claimed that they were ready to slug it out with BJP-led NDA, which has welcomed the announcement of poll dates.JMM, Congress, and CPI (ML-L) said the announcement showed that EC was in a hurry to conduct elections though the assembly tenure was due to end in January next year.Also, both the INDIA bloc and BJP-led NDA are expected to get into huddles to discuss the modalities of seat-sharing which is going to be a challenge for both the competing teams.","The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections, which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra. Elections in Maharashtra will be held in single phase on November 20. The counting of votes will be on November 23.Maharashtra is gearing up for elections as the two major political alliances—the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) and the Mahayuti—prepare to face each other for the first time in a Vidhan Sabha election.The Maha Vikas Aghadi, comprise of the Congress, the Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray), and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) under Sharad Pawar, will go head-to-head with the Mahayuti , which includes the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Shiv Sena faction led by Eknath Shinde, and the NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar. This will be the first electoral contest between these two alliances since the splits within the Shiv Sena and NCP.The MVA is hopeful of replicating its recent Lok Sabha success, while the Mahayuti aims to retain power by leveraging its populist schemes targeted at women and youth. Both alliances have set their sights on winning the state.Narayan Rane, a former Union Minister and the victor in the Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg Lok Sabha constituency, is poised to be a key figure for the BJP in the Konkan region during the forthcoming elections. Meanwhile, two constituencies are expected to be critical battlegrounds: chief minister Eknath Shinde's Kopri-Pachpakdi seat in Thane City and Worli in Mumbai, where Aaditya Thackeray, a leader of the Shiv Sena (UBT), is seeking reelection.In the last Vidhan Sabha elections in 2019, the BJP secured 26.1% of the votes, the Congress 16.1%, the NCP 16.9%, and the Shiv Sena 16.6%. The BJP and the Shiv Sena (then united) formed the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which secured a majority. However, the coalition soon crumbled due to disagreements over government formation, plunging the state into a political crisis.After no party could establish a government, Maharashtra was placed under President's rule. Devendra Fadnavis was briefly sworn in as chief minister, with Ajit Pawar as deputy chief minister. However, both resigned just days later before a scheduled floor test.By November 28, 2019, a new coalition emerged, with the Shiv Sena (Uddhav faction), NCP (Sharad Pawar faction), and Congress forming the Maha Vikas Aghadi government, led by Uddhav Thackeray as chief minister.The state's politics took another turn in June, 2022, when Uddhav Thackeray resigned following a rebellion within the Shiv Sena, led by Eknath Shinde, who then allied with the BJP. Eknath Shinde assumed the role of chief minister, with Devendra Fadnavis returning as deputy chief minister.",The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra. Elections in Maharashtra will be held in single phase on November 20. The counting of votes will be on November 23.

How much does Prashant Kishor charge for political advice? JSP chief reveals fee,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-much-does-prashant-kishor-charge-for-political-advice-jsp-chief-reveals-fee/articleshow/114876035.cms,"Jan Suraaj Party chief Prashant Kishor said that he has charged more than hundred crore as a fee for advising political leaders and their parties during his stint as a poll strategist.During an election rally for the upcoming by-elections in Bihar, Kishor explained how he funds his campaign and said that he can continue his party's campaign for the next two years with just one such election advice to any political party.“Ten governments in different states are running on my strategies,” he said.""Do you think I won't have enough money to set up tents and canopies for my campaign? Do you think I’m that weak? In Bihar, no one has heard of fees like mine. If I advise someone in just one election, my fee is Rs 100 crore or even more. For the next two years, I can continue to fund my campaign with just one such election advice,” he added.Jan Suraaj has fielded four candidates for the upcoming by-elections in Bihar. Mohammad Amjad is in the poll fray from Belaganj, Jitendra Paswan from Imamganj, Sushil Kumar Singh Kushwaha from Ramgarh, and Kiran Singh from Tarari.Kishor officially launched the Jan Suraaj Party on October 2 in Patna, marking its transition from a grassroots campaign to a formal political party. Speaking on the occasion, he noted that Jan Suraaj had been active for two to three years and recently received approval from the Election Commission of India.The party is set to contest all 243 seats in the upcoming Bihar assembly elections, expected in October-November 2025. Kishor has also committed to gender representation, with 40 female candidates in the lineup, as Jan Suraaj seeks to challenge the state’s political landscape.","Jan Suraaj Party chief Prashant Kishor said that he has charged more than hundred crore as a fee for advising political leaders and their parties during his stint as a poll strategist.

"Maharashtra polls: Election debutant list full of politician kin, total 26",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/maharashtra-polls-election-debutant-list-full-of-politician-kin-total-26/articleshow/114900669.cms,"Sharad Pawar’s grandnephew Yugendra Pawar (left); MNS supremo Raj Thackeray's son Amit Thackeray (right)

KOLHAPUR: Dynasts continue to dominate Maharashtra pollscape as most of the candidates making their debut in the 2024 assembly elections are either sons, daughters or close relatives of established political families . Not a single political party, not even the smaller ones, is an exception to this growing trend.Political experts believe that the GenNext debutants are considered the most suitable candidates with “elective merit”.By the practical definition of the term, it means these debutants have a support base and platform ready to make it to the assembly.Some of the prominent debutants from the big parties are late R R Patil’s son Rohit and Sharad Pawar’s grandnephew Yugendra Pawar for NCP (SCP), MNS supremo Raj Thackeray's son Amit and BJP RS member Ashok Chavan’s daughter Sreejaya.Peasants and Workers Party, with its left-leaning ideology, is no exception. Late Ganpatrao Deshmukh’s grandson Babasaheb and the party’s state head Jayant Patil’s daughter-in-law Chitralekha are also in the fray.“The topmost reason for politicians to push their children and family members in the poll fray is to keep the dominance of families in politics. The GenNext leaders get the advantage of the family legacy. These families either have clout within a caste or community or dominance in cooperative and education sectors, and industries. They are indirectly connected with thousands. Some politicians, who launched political parties, get their next generation into the poll arena to continue running the affairs,” said Prakash Pawar, professor, department of politics, Shivaji University, Kolhapur.Some daughters of politicians are also following in on their fathers’ footsteps. For instance, Madhurimaraje Chhatrapati, a member of the Kolhapur royal family and daughter of former minister late Digvijay Khanvilkar, is making her poll debut from Kolhapur North. Khanvilkar was MLA for five terms from Karvir until 2004. Another such example is former MP Raosaheb Danve’s daughter Sanjana Jadhav, who is in the fray for the first time from Kannad on a Shiv Sena ticket.Former deputy CM and state home minister R R Patil, fondly known as Aba, passed away in 2015. He had come up the ranks by first winning the ZP election in Tasgaon, Sangli. He was with NCP and a Sharad Pawar loyalist. His son, Rohit, was 16 when Aba passed away. He jumped into politics to fight alongside his mother, Sumantai, who won the ensuing bypoll.“I never felt that my father was not around because people did not let me feel his absence. My family never forgot those who helped my father contest and win his first election in 1990. It might be the reason that I am in the fray to take that legacy forward,” said Rohit, who turned 25 a few months ago. He will be contesting from the seat his father once represented in the assembly.The 2019 election saw the successful debut of Shiv Sena’s Aaditya Thackeray, NCP’s Rohit Pawar, Congress’s Ruturaj Patil, NCP’s Zeeshan Siddique, Congress’s Dheeraj Deshmukh and NCP’s Aditi Tatkare. Thackeray went on to become a cabinet minister and Tatkare a minister of state and then a cabinet minister in the first term itself.“The phrase ‘catch them young’ is utilised by politicians well as they groom future leaders,” says Prakash Pawar.Most of the top leaders in Maharashtra today belong to political families. Deputy CMs Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar have family legacy. Fadnavis, who was Nagpur mayor and became an MLA in 1999, is the son of former MLA late Gangadhar Fadnavis. Ajit Pawar became an MP at the age of 32, winning from a seat represented by uncle Sharad Pawar.NCP (SCP) state chief Jayant Patil is the son of former minister late Rajarambapu Patil. He became an MLA in 1990 when he was 28-year-old. Ex-CM Prithviraj Chavan of Congress was 40 when he entered Lok Sabha from the Karad constituency.Though most of the GenNext making their poll debut this time are in their 20s or 30s, there is an exception. An arts graduate, Prabhavati Ghogare (57), will contest on a Congress ticket from Shirdi assembly seat against BJP’s Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil. It is her first attempt in the assembly elections, though she won the gram panchayat polls from Loni Khurd in Ahliyanagar in 2021. Her late father-in-law, Chandrabhan Ghogare, was a prominent Congress politician who won the Shirdi seat in 1978. Chandrabhan was close to NCP (SCP)'s Sharad Pawar. “I am confident about defeating my opponents. It does not matter if a candidate is contesting for the first time. I have the confidence to slog on the poll pitch,” Prabhavati said.(With inputs from Ranjan Dasgupta in Nashik and Mohammad Akhef in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar)","Most candidates making their debut in the 2024 assembly elections are either sons, daughters or close relatives of established political families.
