NEW DELHI: Nitin Nabin will take over as BJP national president on Tuesday after emerging, as widely expected, as the sole candidate in fray, with the party’s leading figures from PM Narendra Modi , his cabinet colleagues and CMs, besides hundreds of electors from across country, endorsing his choice for the top organisational job.Modi, who signed the nomination paper in Nabin’s support but was not physically present at party headquarters Monday, is expected to be there when he formally assumes office. Other senior members, including Union ministers Amit Shah and Rajnath Singh and CMs Yogi Adityanath, Mohan Yadav and Nayab Saini, turned up at the venue to be part of the set-piece occasion.K Laxman, party MP and returning officer for the poll, said after nomination process that Nabin is the only contestant in fray. In BJP’s history since its foundation in 1980, its president has always been a consensus choice and never faced electoral contest. A formal announcement of his elevation is scheduled for Tuesday.“I announce that only one name, that of Nitin Nabin, has been proposed for post of national president of BJP,” he said. Nabin (45), currently BJP working president and fifth-term MLA from Bihar, will take over the mantle from JP Nadda six years after the Himachal politician had taken up the position.Nabin will be its youngest-ever president.All 36 organisational states of BJP were part of the nomination-filing process besides its parliamentary party, which included Modi and Shah among others in what was seen a display of wide support for Nabin. Laxman said all 37 sets of nomination were found valid.Ministers and state presidents were seen patiently waiting for their state’s turn — an alphabetical order was followed for different units, to file their nomination in support of Nabin’s candidature. Nabin is expected to preside over his first formal meeting with office bearers in a couple of days.BJP’s Anurag Thakur said election of a young president conveys Modi’s call to Gez Z to be part of politics. Modi and BJP have shown they practice what they preach, he added.","Nitin Nabin will take over as BJP national president on Tuesday after emerging, as widely expected, as the sole candidate in fray.

BMC mayoral race: Corralled Sena men will be freed only after group registration tomorrow; BJP demands Thane post,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/corralled-sena-men-will-be-freed-only-after-group-regn-tomorrow/articleshow/126755055.cms,"





MUMBAI: Corporators of Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena , corralled in a Bandra West five-star hotel from Saturday, will be able to go home only after they complete the procedure of registering their group with the Konkan divisional commissioner Wednesday, Sena sources said.With the state gazette notification announcing winners in BMC polls set to be issued on Tuesday, various political parties will register their groups the next day. “Till the group is registered, no whip can apply to corporators. So, in order to prevent poaching, Sena corporators will move out (of the hotel) after that is done,” a Sena functionary said.While there is talk that Sena is keen to secure Mumbai mayor’s post, BJP on Monday demanded the mayor’s post in Thane municipal corporation, considered a stronghold of deputy CM Shinde. BJP legislator Niranjan Davkhare made a strong pitch for the party to hold the post for two years.Meanwhile, state govt on Monday issued the notification for the mayor’s reservation lottery, which will be held Jan 22; it will be conducted by urban development department. The mayor’s election will likely take place on Jan 31, sources said.Shinde Monday said the mayor in BMC will be from Mahayuti and that there is no dispute with BJP.Party functionaries said Shinde may go to New Delhi to resolve the impasse ahead of the start of Sena founder Bal Thackeray’s centenary on Jan 23.Sena functionaries said a meeting between Sena and BJP members will be held onTuesday, the first after Jan 16 BMC poll results. Sena’s ex MP Rahul Shewale, BJP’s Mumbai unit chief Ameet Satam, senior BJP corporator Prabhakar Shinde and Sena functionary Sheetal Mhatre are likely to be part of the meeting. Shinde said there was no truth to reports of new political equations being formed in Mumbai or elsewhere in Maharashtra.He said, “We will not do the same as Uddhav Thackeray, who formed a separate govt in 2019, disrespecting public mandate. We respect public mandate. These three elections (Lok Sabha, assembly and municipal) were fought with the blessings of Balasaheb Thackeray and guidance of PM Narendra Modi. Accordingly, in places where we fought as Mahayuti, a Mahayuti mayor will be elected. Our fight is not for office or the chair, our fight is for development of Mumbai. We have focused on what we are going to give Mumbaikars.”On Sena corporators’ stay in a hotel, he said, “A meeting of our corporators was held, and they were guided about what they should do in next five years. Sena and BJP have contested BMC elections together as Mahayuti. Wherever we contested elections together as Mahayuti, including Thane, Kalyan-Dombivli, Ulhasnagar, there will be a Mahayuti mayor. It is Balasaheb Thackeray’s birth centenary… so workers may have such a feeling, that the mayor should be from Sena. We will discuss this.”Sena UBT MP Sanjay Raut claimed Shinde was being supported by Delhi BJP to prevent CM Devendra Fadnavis’s chosen corporator from becoming mayor. Apart from Sena, other parties like Sena UBT and Congress are also likely to register their groups on Wednesday. BJP won 89 seats and its ally Shiv Sena 29 in the 227-member BMC.On BJP’s demand for the mayoral post in Thane, its legislator Niranjan Davkhare said the party made adjustments during seatsharing negotiations, and it was now expecting to get important posts in return.Sena won 75 seats in the 131-seat-strong Thane House and BJP 28. He said if the mayor’s position was not given to BJP, the party is prepared to sit in opposition.","Corporators of Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena will be able to go home only after they complete the procedure of registering their group with the Konkan divisional commissioner Wednesday.
