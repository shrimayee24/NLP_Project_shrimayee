Digvijaya Singh's Modi-RSS Praise Draws Jibes From BJP Amid CWC Meet

'Power of the organisation'

BJP attacks Rahul Gandhi

NEW DELHI: Congress on Sunday stopped short of agreeing with its senior leader Digvijay Singh after he gave example of Rashtriya Swayamseva Sangh ( RSS ) to call for organisational reforms within Congress.Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera, reacting to former Madhya Pradesh chief minister's remarks said that an organisation known for Godse can not teach anything to a organisation founded by Gandhi.""There's nothing to learn from the RSS. What can an organisation known for Godse teach an organisation founded by Gandhi?"" Khera said.Earlier on Saturday Digvijay praised the organisational strength of RSS and shared a black-and-white photograph from a social media platform that showed Prime Minister Narendra Modi seated back on the ground while BJP veteran Lal Krishna Advani sat on a chair in the background, acknowledging how the RSS shapes leadership within the organisation.""I found this image on the Quora site. It’s very impressive. How an RSS grassroots swayamsevak and Jan Sangh BJP worker sat on the floor at the feet of leaders and became the state’s Chief Minister and the country’s Prime Minister. This is the power of the organisation.""However, he issued a clarification, saying, ""I've been saying this from the beginning: I am opposed to the ideology of the RSS. They neither respect the Constitution nor the country's laws, and it's an unregistered organisation.""""But I admire their organisational capacity because an organisation that isn't even registered has become so powerful that the Prime Minister says from the Red Fort that it is the world's largest NGO. If it's an NGO, then where have your rules and regulations gone? But I admire their organisational capacity,"" he added.Earlier this week, Singh had also praised Rahul Gandhi for his stance on socio-economic issues, giving him ""full marks"" while calling for internal reforms within the Congress. Drawing a parallel with Rahul Gandhi’s push for Election Commission reforms, Singh argued that the party itself needed similar changes.In another post on X, he wrote, ""Rahul ji you are absolutely ‘Bang On’ in matters of Socio-Economic Issues. Full Marks. But now please look at Congress also. Like Election Commission needs Reforms, So Does Indian National Congress. You have started with 'संघटन सृजन' But we need more Pragmatic Decentralised Functioning.""He added, ""I am sure you would do it because I know you can do it. Only problem is that it is not easy to ‘Convince’ you!!""Meanwhile, BJP alleged that Digvijay's praise for the organisational power of the BJP and the RSS was an ""open dissent"" against Rahul Gandhi's leadership in the party.BJP national spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi alleged that Rahul was bringing his party ""upside down"" because he had been sidelined in the party.""It's because our Narendra Modi is 'guddri ke lal' (diamond in the rough) and their leader is 'Jawahar ke lal' (great-grandson of Jawaharlal Nehru). Since our Narendra Modi has risen to top from bottom, he is taking the party (BJP) also to the top from bottom,"" Trivedi told a press conference at the BJP headquarters here.In a swipe to Rahul, he said, ""Since their leader is 'Jawahar ke lal' who is now 'side down from up', he is bringing his party upside down.""This comes after the Congress held the CWC meet in Delhi on Saturday under the chaimanship of party chief Mallikarjun Kharge -- first after the party suffered a huge loss in Bihar assembly elections.After the CWC meet, Kharge announced that the grand-old-party launch a nation-wide protest against the Centre for replacing rural employment scheme - MGNREGA - with VB G-RAM-G law from January 5.""In the meeting, we took an oath. We decided to launch a massive movement across the country, making the MNREGA scheme the central point. Indian National Congress party, taking a leading role, will launch the Save MNREGA Campaign from January 5th,"" Kharge said.","Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said that an organisation known for Godse can not teach anything to a organisation founded by Gandhi.

'MGNREGA Bachao Abhiyan': Congress Announces Nationwide Protest Against VB-G RAM G Act

NEW DELHI: Congress has lost its foundation and has become a private asset of ""fake"" Gandhi family, BJP alleged on Sunday, taking a jibe at the opposition party on its foundation day.The governing party mocked Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge - who recalled his party's rich legacy and accused BJP of pursuing divisive politics - as a ""remote-controlled"" politician, and said it is his compulsion to keep quiet on critical observations of senior functionaries like Digivijay Singh and Shashi Tharoor.""Partition, POK, losing territory to China, Emergency... and anti-Sikh riots of 1984 when Rajiv Gandhi justified violence... are legacy of Congress,"" BJP national spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia said.He added that the opposition party now stands for ""corruption, and dynastic and communal politics"".""Kharge is so helpless as he serves the fake Gandhi family. He cannot speak a word about their dictatorial style,"" Bhatia alleged.""It is ironical that a party whose foundation has been shaken is celebrating its foundation day,"" he said, adding that Congress has become the weakest link in the Indian democracy. The party should instead connect with the masses and stop denting PM Narendra Modi's vision of 'Viksit Bharat', he said.","BJP says Congress has lost its foundation and has become a private asset of ""fake"" Gandhi family.
