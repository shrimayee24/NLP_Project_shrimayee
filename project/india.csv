Despite deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis saying the BJP is committed to supporting Amit Thackeray , the MNS candidate from the Mahim assembly constituency, sitting Shiv Sena MLA Sada Sarvankar , has begun his campaign with full force.He has hit the campaign trail with roadshows, processions, corner meetings and community engagement initiatives. He launched his campaign on Wednesday evening. He said his eletion was taken over by the people, adding that there was no pressure from any netas on him to withdraw, but there was pressure from Mahim voters to fight the election and win. The last date for withdrawing nominations is Nov 4.“Shiv Sainiks blew trumpets, and the coconuts of the campaign were broken. I started campaigning as a Mahayuti candidate for the Mahim constituency . The first campaign received a great response. Beloved sisters and women Shiv Sainiks were also present in large numbers. All office-bearers and activists of Shiv Sena Mahayuti also participated in the campaign. The same enthusiasm will be seen throughout the election,” Sarvankar said in a post on X.On Wednesday, speaking about the Mahim seat, Fadnavis said, “Even the CM did not want to contest the Mahim seat, but there were some difficulties. Rather, their party leaders were of the opinion that those votes would go to Sena (UBT), and hence they decided to put up a candidate.” He said, “Our stand right from the beginning was that it is one seat where MNS has asked for support, and BJP was in favour of it.”A day after filing his no mination, Sarvankar on Thursday made an emotional appeal to MNS chief Raj Thackeray, asking him “not to do injustice to workers like him and instead give him support”. In a post on X, Sarvankar, who is a three-time MLA, said Shiv Sena supremo late Balasaheb Thackeray would not have asked Sarvankar to give up his seat for Balasaheb’s relatives.

The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections , which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases. The results will be declared on November 23, along with Maharashtra.In the Tribal-dominated state, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and CM Hemant's Soren Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) are in a direct fight, while the Congress party and Lalu Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) are in alliance with the JMM.The JMM-Congress-RJD alliance are also reportedly seeking to deal with Left parties, Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party and other tribal outfits that have been contesting the elections in the state as independent entities and make efforts to field candidates against the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) on all 81 seats collectively.In the last assembly polls in 2019, the JMM-Congress-RJD alliance won a comfortable majority of 47 seats in a House of 81.The BJP slipped to 25 seats from 37 it held in 2014. The poor performance was perceived to be the outcome of its decision to contest alone backfiring. The party did not foster an alliance with the Ajsu in the 2019 polls when Raghubar Das, currently the Odisha governor, was serving the state as CM.In this year's Lok Sabha polls in Jharkhand, the BJP-led NDA secured nine out of the 14 seats, with the BJP winning eight and its alliance partner, the Ajsu (All Jharkhand Students Union) Party, retaining its single seat.On the other hand, the opposition India bloc improved its tally, increasing its seat count from two in 2019 to five in the parliamentary polls.BJP and JMM have spruced up their pace of campaigning from the ground zero to social media. BJP and JMM leaders are actively rebutting and challenging each other on a range of issues, including illegal immigration, youth welfare, employment and housing.INDIA bloc parties in Jharkhand slammed the EC for holding assembly elections in the state along with that of Maharashtra but claimed that they were ready to slug it out with BJP-led NDA, which has welcomed the announcement of poll dates.JMM, Congress, and CPI (ML-L) said the announcement showed that EC was in a hurry to conduct elections though the assembly tenure was due to end in January next year.Also, both the INDIA bloc and BJP-led NDA are expected to get into huddles to discuss the modalities of seat-sharing which is going to be a challenge for both the competing teams.","The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections, which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases. The results will be declared on November 23, along with Maharashtra. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and CM Hemant's Soren Jharkshand Mukti Morcha (JMM) are in a direct fight.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114245990,imgsize-1137124,width-400,resizemode-4/114245990.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra. Elections in Maharashtra will be held in single phase on November 20. The counting of votes will be on November 23.Maharashtra is gearing up for elections as the two major political alliances—the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) and the Mahayuti—prepare to face each other for the first time in a Vidhan Sabha election.The Maha Vikas Aghadi, comprise of the Congress, the Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray), and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) under Sharad Pawar, will go head-to-head with the Mahayuti , which includes the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Shiv Sena faction led by Eknath Shinde, and the NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar. This will be the first electoral contest between these two alliances since the splits within the Shiv Sena and NCP.The MVA is hopeful of replicating its recent Lok Sabha success, while the Mahayuti aims to retain power by leveraging its populist schemes targeted at women and youth. Both alliances have set their sights on winning the state.Narayan Rane, a former Union Minister and the victor in the Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg Lok Sabha constituency, is poised to be a key figure for the BJP in the Konkan region during the forthcoming elections. Meanwhile, two constituencies are expected to be critical battlegrounds: chief minister Eknath Shinde's Kopri-Pachpakdi seat in Thane City and Worli in Mumbai, where Aaditya Thackeray, a leader of the Shiv Sena (UBT), is seeking reelection.In the last Vidhan Sabha elections in 2019, the BJP secured 26.1% of the votes, the Congress 16.1%, the NCP 16.9%, and the Shiv Sena 16.6%. The BJP and the Shiv Sena (then united) formed the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which secured a majority. However, the coalition soon crumbled due to disagreements over government formation, plunging the state into a political crisis.After no party could establish a government, Maharashtra was placed under President's rule. Devendra Fadnavis was briefly sworn in as chief minister, with Ajit Pawar as deputy chief minister. However, both resigned just days later before a scheduled floor test.By November 28, 2019, a new coalition emerged, with the Shiv Sena (Uddhav faction), NCP (Sharad Pawar faction), and Congress forming the Maha Vikas Aghadi government, led by Uddhav Thackeray as chief minister.The state's politics took another turn in June, 2022, when Uddhav Thackeray resigned following a rebellion within the Shiv Sena, led by Eknath Shinde, who then allied with the BJP. Eknath Shinde assumed the role of chief minister, with Devendra Fadnavis returning as deputy chief minister.",The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra.

Board claims Haveri court, Hindu burial ground

Waqf laws are being misused in state: Bommai

HAVERI: Tension gripped a village in Haveri district after scores of villagers, fearing their houses would be taken over by Waqf Board , attacked buildings and houses of a particular community, leaving five people injured on Wednesday night.Police said the situation in Kadakol village of Savanur taluk is peaceful now. A person who received grievous injuries in the violence was taken to Hubballi’s KIMS for treatment. He is out of danger, a police officer said. In the incident, miscreants allegedly threw stones and ransacked houses, besides destroying a parked motorcycle in the village.Some 200 police personnel and four KSRP platoons have been rushed to the village, officials said.Police will initiate action against those who take law into their hands, said district superintendent of police Anshu Kumar, adding 32 people have been picked up for interrogation.Waqf minister BZ Zameer Ahmed Khan accused BJP of hatching a conspiracy around waqf properties and said the party has been misleading farmers across the state.The trouble started with rumours that most properties around a shrine in the village have been marked as waqf assets, and they would soon be acquired. However, deputy commissioner Vijay Mahantesh clarified that they have directed assistant commissioners and tahsildars to “verify all property documents listed by the district waqf board and send a report to the office. This means not all these belong to the board.”In a related development, Haveri District Waqf Board has claimed ownership of Haveri District Court premises, which sits on a 20-acre land, and 19- acre Hindu burial ground in Tadas village of Shiggaon taluk in the district.The fresh claim comes years after the disputes were resolved at Waqf Tribunal, Belagavi, through the intervention of S Abdul Nazeer, who served as both high court judge and administrative justice of Haveri district court.Basavaraj Bommai, former CM and MP, has urged the state govt to withdraw the notices sent to farmers regarding waqf properties. He said there is improper application of waqf law in the state, with agricultural lands being incorrectly classified as waqf properties while disregarding the existing revenue laws.Interacting with media in Shiggaon on Thursday, Bommai emphasised that revenue law records should be considered definitive with regard to land matters.“These records are being overlooked in favour of Waqf Tribunal decisions. While previous court interventions protected the affected parties’ rights, currently, a simple application can result in farmland being designated as waqf property, causing distress among farmers,” he said, dubbing the govt “irresponsible”.He held the state govt accountable for tension in villages like Kadakol in Savanur taluk, stating it has disturbed peaceful coexistence of rural communities. He accused the govt of indulging in appeasement policies after assuming the office.",Trouble started with rumours that most properties around a shrine in the village have been marked as waqf assets. 200 police personnel and four KSRP platoons have been rushed to the village. 32 people have been picked up for interrogation.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114833083,imgsize-78866,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/114833083.jpg"
