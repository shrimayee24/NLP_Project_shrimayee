What the Delhi LG said on Kejriwal's health

NEW DELHI: The Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) on Saturday attacked Lt Governor VK Saxena 's letter on Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal 's diet and also accused the BJP of hatching a ""sinister plan to kill"" the leader.AAP Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh criticised the LG in a post on X for allegedly insinuating that Kejriwal was ""deliberately"" making himself sick.""What kind of joke is this LG Sir? Would a man reduce his sugar levels at night? Which is very dangerous. LG Sir, if you do not know about the disease then you should not write such a letter,"" Singh said in a post in Hindi.The party also in a statement claimed that the ""BJP is hatching a sinister plan to kill Kejriwal.""Delhi minister Atishi claimed Kejriwal's sugar level has dipped below 50 mg/dL more than 8 times in jail and added, ""He may go into a coma and there is also a risk of brain stroke in such a situation.""On LG's letter, Atishi said the communication from his office was ""very unfortunate"" and does not befit a constitutional head of the state.""Does LG think that any person will deliberately make himself sick like this? This is a conspiracy of the Bhartiya Janata Party. They know that the longer he stays in jail, the more his health will keep deteriorating. So I would like to request LG Sahab that it does not suit him to make such comments on anyone's health,"" she said.Meanwhile, the BJP also targetted Arvind Kejriwal alleging that the AAP chief was ""deliberately"" taking fewer calories of food for ""sympathy"".Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva said the report of the Tihar jail superintendent has ""exposed"" Kejriwal's ""conspiracy"" to gain ""sympathy"" by ""deliberately"" taking fewer calories of food and declining insulin to claim weight loss and high blood sugar level in jail.""He campaigned hectically for 21 days, after getting bail from the court, during Lok Sabha polls and he had no health problems then. But, now he is trying to gain sympathy on the pretext of his health condition,"" Sachdeva charged.BJP national general secretary Tarun Chugh also targetted Sunita Kejriwal and said, ""Atishi and Sanjay Singh should ask Sunita Kejriwal to focus on nutritional supplements rather than on election campaign. Arvind Kejriwal gets to eat what Sunita Kejriwal sends for him.""The statement came after Sunita Kejriwal earlier in the day held an event in Haryana and announced 'Kejriwal's guarantees' ahead of assembly polls.Delhi LG VK Saxena accused Kejriwal of deliberately avoiding the prescribed medical diet and medicines, despite being provided with sufficient home-cooked food.This allegation is based on a report from the Superintendent (Prison) regarding Kejriwal's health status, according to communication from Raj Niwas.Saxena, in a letter to chief secretary Naresh Kumar, highlighted several instances of ""willful low calorie intake"" by Kejriwal, pointing out that Kejriwal was not consuming the prescribed diet for all three meals from June 6 to July 13.The letter alleges that Kejriwal's weight dropped from 63.5 kg on June 2, 2024, to 61.5 kg by July 13, likely due to reduced calorie intake. ""The report also suggests loss of weight (now 61.5 kg which earlier was 63.5 Kg on the date of surrender - June 2, 2024). Prima facie, it appears to be due to less calorie intake,"" stated Saxena's letter.","Delhi LG VK Saxena accused Kejriwal of deliberately avoiding the prescribed medical diet and medicines, despite being provided with sufficient home-cooked food.

Oppn set to up ante against BJP over dy Speaker post,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/oppn-set-to-up-ante-against-bjp-over-dy-speaker-post/articleshow/111892788.cms,"NEW DELHI: The deputy Speaker's post is set to create more furore in Parliament, with the opposition deciding to pressure BJP in the Budget session to give the perch to the rivals.It is learnt that INDIA bloc is likely to start the pressure campaign by speaking about the demand at the all-party meeting called by parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju on Sunday.It will then be part of discussions during the session which has the Union budget as the main agenda.Sources said INDIA bloc constituents have decided that the subject should remain at the forefront of their wish list. During the inaugural session of the 18th Lok Sabha, the opposition joined ranks to seek the Deputy Speaker's post, reminding govt that it was the trend till BJP came to power in 2014. While BJP gave the post to its ally AIADMK later in its first tenure, the post remained vacant for the entire second term of PM Narendra Modi.The opposition started the 18th Lok Sabha last month by seeking the deputy's post in lieu of which it was ready to support govt in the Speaker's election. After BJP refused to accede to its plea, the opposition fielded senior most MP in the House, Kodikunnil Suresh of Congress, against the BJP-NDA candidate Om Birla who was eventually elected as Speaker by a voice vote. There have since been speculations that BJP will again give the post to a coalition ally.But the opposition has not given up the demand and is ready to start the Budget session by flagging it again. Sources said the decision was taken at an informal consultation among the opposition allies. There is no clarity on the nature of consensus that would emerge in the INDIA bloc, but TMC has openly stated that the post should go to the Faizabad (Ayodhya) MP of Samajwadi Party Awadhesh Prasad, who has been in the limelight since winning the UP constituency of which the temple town is a part.Congress may not have an objection to it, but would prefer Suresh. Both Prasad and Suresh are dalit.

""Dalits who are in the food preparation system are often looked at with prejudice,"" opposition Congress wrote in a letter to the CM, highlighted instances where Dalits faced discrimination, such as children refusing mid-day meals prepared by Dalit women and a young man selling biryani being assaulted when it was discovered he was a Dalit.UP deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya backed the directive, accusing the opposition of appeasement politics. ""Rather than criticising the yatra, the opposition should participate in it and purge themselves of all their sins,"" he said Saturday.Kanwar Yatra is an annual pilgrimage where devotees, known as Kanwariyas, travel to collect water from the Ganga to offer at Shiva temples in their hometowns and villages.""The yatra is associated with the sentiments of crores of devotees...""

She was found staying under a fake identity in a homestay

PUNE: Manorama Khedkar , mother of probationary IAS Puja Khedkar , was arrested on Thursday from a homestay in Raigad district.“She had hired a private cab to visit different places before moving into the home stay facility around 11 pm on Wednesday. She was staying there under a fictitious identity ‘Indubai Dhakane’. The cab driver, Dadasaheb Dhakane, showed his genuine Aadhaar card to the facility owner while Manorama showed the Aadhaar card of the cab driver’s mother to get the room booked,” said Pune Rural SP Pankaj Deshmukh.“Our team, which was tracking her movements, was alerted by a cellphone number which got activated while it was put on surveillance.The location of this cell phone was Hirkaniwadi and our team immediately reached there,” the SP said.Paud police in rural Pune on July 12 had registered the case after a video recently went viral on social media showing Manorama, accompanied by bouncers, brandishing a .25 Webley & Scott pistol on June 5, 2023, during an argument with some farmers over a land ownership issue at Dhadhawali village in Mulshi taluka. One of the farmers lodged a complaint.Manorama was produced before judicial magistrate first class Sudhir G Barde in Paud on Thursday afternoon and was remanded in police custody till July 20 after assistant public prosecutor Amar Nanaware told the court that the police have invoked an attempted murder charge against Manorama on the basis of a supplementary statement recorded by complainant Pandharinath Pasalkar.Pasalkar alleged in the complaint that Manorama reached the parcel of land in a four-wheeler and picked up an argument with him.“She abused and threatened me and other villagers when I told her to leave the place as the land dispute would be decided by the civil court where the matter is pending. However, she insisted that she had purchased the land and her name was in the 7/12 extract showing ownership,” the complainant stated.In the supplementary statement, Pasalkar alleged that Manorama put a pistol to his head and was about to pull the trigger when he sat down in a panic reaction and people accompanying her pulled her back.Nanaware submitted that Pasalkar had then filed a complaint application against Manorama and others with the Paud police but did not pursue the matter out of fear. Pasalkar approached the police after the video relating to the incident went viral on social media recently.Nanaware also submitted in court that the police needed Manorama’s custodial remand to recover her licensed pistol and establish the places she visited while on the run.Nanware also said that the police needed to arrest the other accused named in the FIR and seek details of the land dispute that led to the incident.Manohar Aukirkar, the owner of ‘Parvati Nivas,’ said, “Around 11pm on Wednesday, aman, who drove to our establishment in a car, approached me and said that he and his mother needed a room for an overnight stay. It was raining heavily then and since a woman was accompanying him, we took a humanitarian approach and gave them a room on the second floor of the facility.”Aukirkar said, “We checked the man’s Aadhaar card which carried the name Dadasaheb Dhakane and his photo. The man told us that his mother’s name was Indubai Dhakane. After recording their details, we gave him the room keys.”The video of Manorama brandishing the firearm surfaced after her daughter, probationary IAS officer Puja Khedkar, was shunted to Washim from Pune for demanding facilities she was not entitled to get.Soon one thing after the other started tumbling out about the family, and questions were also raised about Puja’s OBC and disability certificates, which she had used to get IAS cadre despite asub-800 UPSC score.","Manorama Khedkar, mother of probationary IAS Puja Khed Kar, was arrested on Thursday from a homestay in Raigad district.

""I was asked by Nitish Kumar to merge my party with JD(U) or leave"", said Manjhi, as quoted by news agency PTI. The HAMS chief had previously followed the JD(U) boss in leaving the NDA and later rejoining it, a move that allowed Suman to retain his ministerial position without interruption.Both Manjhi's party HAMS and Nitish Kumar's JDU are part of the NDA alliance.Earlier in the day, Jitan Ram Manjhi also voiced his support for the Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand governments' directive to eateries along the Kanwar Yatra route to display their owners' names.
