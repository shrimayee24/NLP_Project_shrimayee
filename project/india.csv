Daughter looks to avenge Shinde losses as BJP eyes hat-trick,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/daughter-looks-to-avenge-shinde-losses-as-bjp-eyes-hat-trick/articleshow/109899549.cms,"PUNE/KOLHAPUR: It isn’t anti-incumbency or relative weakness of allies that could come in the way of a BJP hat-trick in Solapur . What could prove to be the party’s undoing is the dismal scorecard of its MPs on ‘Smart City’ work implementation, big ticket infrastructure projects and the festering drinking water crisis — to name a few — in the last decade.While the saffron party appears to be struggling for a narrative to sell its nominee, Ram Satpute, to the people, its main challenger, Congress’s Praniti Shinde , is rubbing in the ‘no-development’ message.Amid a whirlwind of meetings and rallies in the rural hinterland, the three-term MLA from Solapur City Central makes it a point to rake up BJP’s “failures” and plead for a chance to do better.“Solapur has been suffering for the last decade as the two BJP MPs ignored the real issues plaguing the district. They could not make the airport operational or set up an IT park. I will accord priority to development projects, if elected,” Praniti recently said.On her daily rounds, Praniti never forgets to ignite a debate on Satpute’s “outsider” status. Speaking at a rally, Praniti said, “We need to pack him (Satpute) this time and send the parcel back to Beed.” Satpute was born in Ashti tehsil of Beed district, 180 km north of Solapur. His father, a sugarcane harvester, moved to Bhamburdi in Solapur’s Malshiras tehsil, where Satpute completed his secondary education before going to Pune for higher studies.Praniti’s remark prompted BJP to claim that its candidate was not “born with a silver spoon in his mouth”, an apparent reference to Praniti’s status as the daughter of former CM and Union home minister Sushilkumar Shinde.“Our candidate is connected to all sections of society. He has been working hard for the poor,” Sachin Kalyanshetti, BJP’s Solapur district president and Akkalkot MLA, told TOI.In the 2014 polls, BJP’s Sharad Bansode defeated then MP Sushilkumar Shinde. In 2019, Shinde was again trounced by Lingayat seer Jaisiddeshwar Shivacharya. Data reveals that Bansode participated in just seven debates in Lok Sabha against the national average of 67. Shivacharya took part in 28 debates, while the national average was 47. Bansode asked just 43 questions and Shivacharya 112, against the national average of 293 and 210, respectively.Calling this a fight to save the Constitution, Praniti said, “Election to the Solapur Municipal Corporation has not been held for the last two years. The city receives water once a week. There are no funds for development work. Solapur elected two MPs in the last 10 years. They got a golden opportunity to develop the city, but they didn’t.”Satpute, on the other hand, has challenged Praniti to discuss the Centre’s contribution. “From water pipeline to Smart City work, the Centre has spent huge funds in the last decade. On the contrary, Sushilkumar Shinde, as Union minister and CM, didn’t do anything for So lapur. So, Praniti should tell the public what her father has done.”Praniti’s allegations are, however, not completely baseless. In 2016, Solapur was among the 20 cities selected for the Smart City project. A special administrative wing was set up for its implementation. However, eight years later, the Centre’s assessment puts the city among the six worst performers. While no major infrastructure work has been initiated, the plan to acquire 40 electric buses has been stalled over poor response from private operators. Reeling under a severe water crisis, people see their taps run dry for nearly six days a week. Water level in Ujani dam, the city’s main supply source, is depleting fast as there was scant rainfall last monsoon.The only reserved LS seat for SCs in western Maharashtra, Solapur was traditionally one of the “safest constituencies” for Congress. While BJP galloped to victory riding the Modi wave in 2014, what worked in its favour in the next elections was the support of Lingayats (20% or 3.5 lakh voters). BJP in 2019 also convinced Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) chief Prakash Ambedkar to contest. This helped divide Dalit, Muslim and Dhangar votes.“Congress candidates had traditionally got votes from Dalit and Muslim com munities in Solapur. But Ambedkar secured 1.70 lakh votes. That was a big blow to Shinde, who lost by a margin of 1.58 lakh votes,” a political observer said.But this time, the observer pointed out, BJP has neither fielded a Lingayat candidate nor is VBA in the fray. “Besides, there is a negative impression among people about the poor performance of the BJP MPs in the last two terms.”BJP is trying to woo the Padamshali community that controls most of the factories producing chaddars and towels. The community had given the party its first MP from western Maharashtra — Lingraj Valyal from Solapur in 1996. In his recent speech, PM Modi recalled his ties with the community. “During my childhood, a Padamshali family in Ahmedabad used to feed me three to four times a month. They were poor and used to live in a chawl. But they never let me sleep hungry.”BJP, too, never misses a chance to target Congress. Praniti, on the day she filed her nomination, brought the famous doppelganger of Shah Rukh Khan — Ibrahim Qadri — for campaigning. BJP’s national spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla was quick to write on X that after peddling fake surveys, Congress was using deep fakes, and called it another scam of the grand old party.",Solapur is traditionally one of the safest constituencies for Congress. Praniti Shinde is rubbing in the ‘no-development’ message. Solapur elected two MPs in the last 10 years. Data reveals that Bansode participated in just seven debates in Lok Sabha.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109899634,imgsize-1298716,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/109899634.jpg"

ED searches linked to money laundering case

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said he was taking legal advice on how to return the money of poor people 'looted' in corruption as he cited the ""mounds of cash"" seized during ED raids in Jharkhand at the premises of a domestic help allegedly linked to the secretary of Congress minister Alamgir Alam . The probe agency has claimed to have recovered an estimated Rs 20-30 crore ""unaccounted"" cash during searches.Referring to the seizure, Modi wondered why such persons were ""close to the Congress's first family"" and sought answers from Rahul Gandhi .""Why is that those, from whom mounds of cash are recovered, are close to the Congress's first family? Was the seized cash meant for supply somewhere, is it that Congress's first family has created warehouses of black money? The country wants to know from Congress shehzada,"" the PM said at an election rally in an apparent jibe at Rahul Gandhi.""They have made the worker's house a godown of corruption. This is not the first time as a bigger seizure was made from an MP (in Jharkhand) earlier also and it was such a big cache that even machines were tired of counting,"" PM Modi said.The Prime Minister alleged that the Congress and INDI alliance people 'abuse' him whenever he 'catches' their black money. However, he was worried not about the abuses, but the poor, ""whose money these corrupt have looted.""Prime Minister Modi said he is taking legal advice on returning the looted corruption money.""So far, the ED alone has attached property worth Rs 1.25 lakh crore and ""if others"" (central agencies) are included it may be more. I am taking legal advice on how the money can be returned to those from whom it has been looted,"" the PM said.Jharkhand rural development minister Alamgir Alam urged patience and restraint in jumping to conclusions.""Sanjiv Lal is a government employee. He is my personal secretary. Sanjiv Lal has already been personal secretary of two former ministers. There are several government employees and we usually appoint personal secretary based on experience. It is not right to comment on the raids before the ED investigation is completed,"" Alam said.The ED searches were linked to a money laundering case against the former chief engineer of the rural works department, Veerendra Kumar Ram, who was arrested last year.""Veerendra Kumar Ram, posted as chief engineer in the Rural Works Department in Ranchi, had generated proceeds of crime in the name of commission from contractors in lieu of allotment of tenders to them,"" the agency had alleged in a statement issued last year in April after it attached assets worth Rs 39 crore of the officer.""The proceeds of crime thus generated were used by Veerendra Kumar Ram and his family members to live a very lavish lifestyle,"" it said.(With inputs from agencies)","Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was taking legal advice on how to return the money of poor people 'looted' in corruption.

Acharya Pramod Krishnam: Sacked Congress leader claims Rahul Gandhi had planned to overturn Ram Mandir verdict if voted to power,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sacked-congress-leader-claims-rahul-gandhi-had-planned-to-overturn-ram-mandir-verdict-if-voted-to-power/articleshow/109883886.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former Congress leader Acharya Pramod Krishnam on Monday claimed that Rahul Gandhi had made plans to overturn the Supreme Court verdict which facilitated construction of grand Ram Mandir in Ayodhya if the grand old party formed a government at the Centre.""I have spent more than 32 years in the Congress. When the Ram Mandir decision came, Rahul Gandhi in a meeting with his close aides had said that if the Congress formed a government after elections, a superpower commission would be created to overturn the Ram Mandir verdict just like Rajiv Gandhi had changed the SC ruling in the Shah Bano case ,"" Pramod Krishnam told news agency ANI.The former Congress leader further claimed that Rahul Gandhi had mooted this idea on the advice and signal of one of his well-wishers who lived in America. The reference was possibly to Indian Overseas Congress chairman Sam Pitroda . When preparations for the inauguration of Ram Temple in Ayodhya were on full swing, Pitroda had stirred a controversy by questioning the hype around the consecration ceremony and the Prime Minister's participation in the grand opening.Pitroda had then said ""I have no problem with any religion. I am only saying that don't mix religion with politics. Pandit Nehru, Lal bahadur Shashtri did not use religion for politics. It is okay to visit temple once in a while, but you can't make that the main platform. 40 per cent of the people vote for the BJP, 60 per cent of the people do not vote for the BJP. He is everybody's Prime Minister & not BJP's Prime Minister and that's the message people of India want the Prime Minister to give.""""The people of India will have to decide what are the real issues - is Ram Mandir the real issue? Or unemployment is a real issue. Is Ram Mandir the real issue or is inflation a real issue. Is Ram Mandir the real issue or is the air pollution in Delhi the real issue?"" he had added.Congress expelled Acharya Pramod Krishnam from party for “indiscipline and anti-party activities” days after he criticised party leadership for skipping Ram Lalla’s consecration ceremony in Ayodhya and termed the decision as “anti-Hindu”.On the Congress decision to field Rahul Gandhi from Rae Bareli, the former Congress leader had said that Priyanka Gandhi Vadra was deliberately denied a ticket to contest the Lok Sabha elections and she was a ""victim of family and party conspiracy"".""I said this earlier that Rahul Gandhi will not contest Amethi. I said this, too, that Rahul Gandhi will not let Priyanka Gandhi Vadra fight these elections. There is a big conspiracy afoot against Priyanka. She is the victim of a conspiracy hatched by her family and the party,"" Acharya Krishnam had told ANI on Friday.The Congress had boycotted the Ram Mandir consecration ceremony in Ayodhya on January 22.

BHUBANESWAR: In a rally attended by tens of thousands, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday predicted Naveen Patnaik 's uninterrupted run since 2000 will end on June 10, when a BJP CM will take oath , evoking sharp reactions from the ruling BJD leaders.While initiating his campaign for the simultaneous Lok Sabha and assembly elections in the state that gets underway on May 13, Modi said in Berhampur that on June 6, two days after the results are out, BJP's CM candidate will be revealed.""On June 10, a BJP CM will take oath.

Good News For Congress

MP Banks On PM, Father

Families of former Karnataka chief ministers S Bangarappa and B S Yediyurappa are once again locked in a battle for Shimoga Lok Sabha seat that votes on May 7. What makes this round different is the presence of BJP rebel and former deputy CM, K S Eshwarappa, in the fray.Eshwarappa, a lifelong ABVP/BJP adherent, was denied a BJP ticket in last year’s Karnataka assembly polls.But this time, when the party overlooked his son K E Kanthesh’s bid to contest from neighbouring Haveri Lok Sabha seat, he rebelled. Eshwarappa believes Yediyurappa and his sons engineered Kanthesh’s rejection, so he’s contesting “to teach them a lesson”.Speaking to TOI, he said he wants to rid BJP’s national leadership of its “illusion” that Yediyurappa and family are indispensable. He is canvassing Raghavendra’s Hindutva voters by telling them the Yediyurappa clan sidelined hard-core ideologues like C T Ravi, Nalin Kumar Kateel and DV Sadan anda Gowda. He is also banking on women’s self-help groups that have benefited from his family-run microfinance company, and the 25,000-odd Tamil ians in the constituency.Eshwarappa’s rebellion is good news for Congress. “The more votes he takes, the brighter our chances of victory,” said Basavarajappa, a Congress worker in Shimoga’s Eesuru village. Party candi date Geetha Shivarajkumar is the late Bangarappa’s daughter. Her husband, Kannada film star Shivarajkumar, and brother Madhu Bangarappa, a minister in the Karnataka state govt, have been campaigning for her for a month.The Yediyurappas have beaten the Bangarappas in Shimoga the last four times, but it used to be S Bangarappa’s fortress once, and he won four elections here. Last time a Bangarappa came close to winning the seat was in the 2018 by-election when Madhu contested as a Congress-JD(S) alliance candidate.Geetha is hoping to break the Yediyurappas’ hold on the seat. She is banking heavily on the five guarantees that Karnataka’s Congress govt has implemented and the party’s promise to give Rs 1 lakh per year to women heads of families. “Her victory seems certain because the backward classes, scheduled castes and tribes, who have benefited from Congress’s guarantees, dominate this constituency,” said Naveen, a Congress sympathiser.Geetha and Madhu have also been working relentlessly to consolidate the four lakh votes of their Idiga community. A few film actors, including Duniya Vijay, have drawn crowds to Geetha’s meetings and rallies.BJP’s Raghavendra is banking on his father’s popularity among voters of all castes, PM Modi’s appeal and rapid development in urban pockets over the last decade. He is credited with improving the district’s highways, roads and rail links, and even opponents concede “Raghanna” is a worker.For the Yediyurappas, winning Shimoga is key to maintaining their grip on the state BJP amid growing opposition, especially since Raghavendra’s younger brother B Y Vijayendra became BJP state unit president.“We realise the importance of winning this election and the necessity of overcoming Eshwarappa’s rebellion. But my performance as an MP and Modi’s popularity will help me win comfortably,” Raghavendra told TOI.","K S Eshwarappa, a lifelong ABVP/BJP adherent, was denied a BJP ticket in last year’s Karnataka assembly polls.

It is not the opinion of Congress,” Chennithala said. Paying rich tributes to Karkare, Chennithala said the then Congress govt had taken the case against Kasab to a logical end and the terrorist was hanged. Tharoor, on the other hand, said in Pune, “I cannot comment if the claim is true or not but since it is a serious allegation, it should be thoroughly investigated. Karkare was a popular officer. I had met him and I hold a lot of respect for him. I feel the inquiry into his death in a professional manner should be initiated.”CM Eknath Shinde accused Congress of insulting the martyrs of 26/11 and claimed it was aligning with Pakistan. He also questioned UBT Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray’s silence over the issue. State BJP president Chandrashekar Bawankule asked how Congress could stoop so low. Tharoor said the claim (about Kasab not killing Karkare) had been made by a retired IPS officer in his book. “Leader of opposition (Wadettiwar) raised the issue which has been in the public domain for some time… Such a serious issue should be investigated in a professional manner,” he said.Criticising Ujjwal Nikam, whom Wadettiwar accused of “suppressing the truth” as special public prosecutor in the 26/11 case, he said, “The candidate (Nikam) related to whom the issue has come up had made a claim that biryani was served to Kasab in jail, which was refuted by the then IPS officer Meeran Borwankar.” He clarified that the Congress had no sympathy for terrorism.Devika Rotawan, the youngest eyewitness in the trial of Kasab, on Monday slammed Wadettiwar without naming him and said one should not “sprinkle salt on wounds” in this manner. CM Shinde said, “Congress has no remorse for our heroes but is apparently worried about Kasab. Such remarks evoke anger in every Indian’s mind. Congress and Rahul Gandhi have no moral right to seek votes. Voters will teach them a lesson.”Shinde criticised Congress for meekly tolerating violence over the last several years, including the 26/11 attacks. “While we were expecting the Congress-led govt to avenge the attack and loss of our innocent civilians and officers, they only meekly complained to global leaders about the incident. In stark contrast, Narendra Modi, during his tenure as PM, has ensured our country bravely and promptly retaliates against all terror attempts through surgical strikes, that too in enemy lands. We are in a position now where world powers listen to us when we speak,” he said.Questioning Uddhav Thackeray’s silence, he said, “He (Uddhav) said the country doesn’t need Modi, but I am asking if we need a leader who works from home and does Facebook live. If Balasaheb was alive, he would not have tolerated this.”Bawankule said, “Do you back Ajmal Kasab to oppose BJP? Have some shame. Ever since Narendra Modi came to power, terrorists have been wiped out, but today Congress is shedding tears for them. When MVA was in power in Maharashtra, Yakub Memon’s grave was beautified, now Kasab’s regiment is marching out. People will give a befitting lesson to Congress.""

AHMEDABAD: Gujarat HC overturned on Monday the life imprisonment sentence of former BJP MPand six others in the 2010 murder case of RTI activist Amit Jethava, criticising both the initial investigation and subsequent CBI probe . “It appears that loopholes in the investigation are deliberately kept unfastened in order to alter the final outcome of complicity of accused in crime,” the court said.While acquitting the seven for the murder of Jethava, who was fatally shot on July 20, 2010, outside HC allegedly for using RTI to uncover illegal mining within Gir forest, the bench of Justice AS Supehia and Justice VK Vyas deemed the investigation “iniquitous and biased” from its inception, leading to its transfer to CBI.The court chastised CBI’s handling of the case. “While reposing immense faith in CBI, this court had handed over the investigation to it. However, the facts indicate that CBI also carried out a slipshod and perfunctory investigation,” HC said.The bench meticulously scrutinised the evidence, highlighting numerous instances of investigative lapses. It criticized the lack of effort in extracting relevant evidence, particularly from hostile witnesses.“No efforts were made to extract relevant evidence with corroborative value. Witnesses who were cross-examined were enjoying police protection, but all turned hostile and ditched the prosecution,” HC stated.The high court further lambasted CBI for failing to meet the “highest standards akin to its stature” and expressed disappointment that crucial steps were overlooked. “It is not palatable that CBI officer, Mukesh Sharma, would ignore or forget to visit the place where the alleged conspiracy was hatched, i.e. Harmadiya Farm,” HC said. It also pointed out the absence of essential evidence collection, such as CCTV footage and mobile phone data from the deceased.","Gujarat HC overturns life sentence of former BJP MPand six others in the 2010 murder case of RTI activist Amit Jethava.

The development is being seen as a jolt to Dhananjay Singh who had walked out of the jail on bail last week. Initially, Dhananjay, a former BSP MP from Jaunpur, wanted to contest from the seat but was rendered ineligible following his conviction in a case of kidnapping and extortion.Sources in BSP camp said the party took the decision to replace Shrikala in view of Dhananjay's growing proximity to the BJP and the buzz that he may switch sides.Reacting to BSP decision, Dhananjay said, ""It is not shocking for me as BSP has done this several times with me in the past. BSP coordinators are new and they should avoid levelling false allegations on me to justify their decision of replacing the candidates. BSP knows it well that it cannot pressurise me despite lodging several cases and sending me to jail in 2002 and 2007.""Regarding his future move, Dhananjay said it will be decided in a day or two after discussing with his supporters. ""Only the candidate who enjoys my support will win (in Jaunpur),"" he added.Meanwhile, Shyam Singh Yadav filed his nomination from Jaunpur on Monday.In Basti, BSP has replaced Dayanshankar Mishra with Lavkush Patel.

Daughter looks to avenge Shinde losses as BJP eyes hat-trick in Solapur,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/lok-sabha-elections/lok-sabha-election-news/daughter-looks-to-avenge-shinde-losses-as-bjp-eyes-hat-trick/india/daughter-looks-to-avenge-shinde-losses-as-bjp-eyes-hat-trick/articleshow/109899549.cms,"PUNE/KOLHAPUR: It isn’t anti-incumbency or relative weakness of allies that could come in the way of a BJP hat-trick in Solapur . What could prove to be the party’s undoing is the dismal scorecard of its MPs on ‘Smart City’ work implementation, big ticket infrastructure projects and the festering drinking water crisis — to name a few — in the last decade.While the saffron party appears to be struggling for a narrative to sell its nominee, Ram Satpute, to the people, its main challenger, Congress’s Praniti Shinde , is rubbing in the ‘no-development’ message.Amid a whirlwind of meetings and rallies in the rural hinterland, the three-term MLA from Solapur City Central makes it a point to rake up BJP’s “failures” and plead for a chance to do better.“Solapur has been suffering for the last decade as the two BJP MPs ignored the real issues plaguing the district. They could not make the airport operational or set up an IT park. I will accord priority to development projects, if elected,” Praniti recently said.On her daily rounds, Praniti never forgets to ignite a debate on Satpute’s “outsider” status. Speaking at a rally, Praniti said, “We need to pack him (Satpute) this time and send the parcel back to Beed.” Satpute was born in Ashti tehsil of Beed district, 180 km north of Solapur. His father, a sugarcane harvester, moved to Bhamburdi in Solapur’s Malshiras tehsil, where Satpute completed his secondary education before going to Pune for higher studies.Praniti’s remark prompted BJP to claim that its candidate was not “born with a silver spoon in his mouth”, an apparent reference to Praniti’s status as the daughter of former CM and Union home minister Sushilkumar Shinde.“Our candidate is connected to all sections of society. He has been working hard for the poor,” Sachin Kalyanshetti, BJP’s Solapur district president and Akkalkot MLA, told TOI.In the 2014 polls, BJP’s Sharad Bansode defeated then MP Sushilkumar Shinde. In 2019, Shinde was again trounced by Lingayat seer Jaisiddeshwar Shivacharya. Data reveals that Bansode participated in just seven debates in Lok Sabha against the national average of 67. Shivacharya took part in 28 debates, while the national average was 47. Bansode asked just 43 questions and Shivacharya 112, against the national average of 293 and 210, respectively.Calling this a fight to save the Constitution, Praniti said, “Election to the Solapur Municipal Corporation has not been held for the last two years. The city receives water once a week. There are no funds for development work. Solapur elected two MPs in the last 10 years. They got a golden opportunity to develop the city, but they didn’t.”Satpute, on the other hand, has challenged Praniti to discuss the Centre’s contribution. “From water pipeline to Smart City work, the Centre has spent huge funds in the last decade. On the contrary, Sushilkumar Shinde, as Union minister and CM, didn’t do anything for So lapur. So, Praniti should tell the public what her father has done.”Praniti’s allegations are, however, not completely baseless. In 2016, Solapur was among the 20 cities selected for the Smart City project. A special administrative wing was set up for its implementation. However, eight years later, the Centre’s assessment puts the city among the six worst performers. While no major infrastructure work has been initiated, the plan to acquire 40 electric buses has been stalled over poor response from private operators. Reeling under a severe water crisis, people see their taps run dry for nearly six days a week. Water level in Ujani dam, the city’s main supply source, is depleting fast as there was scant rainfall last monsoon.The only reserved LS seat for SCs in western Maharashtra, Solapur was traditionally one of the “safest constituencies” for Congress. While BJP galloped to victory riding the Modi wave in 2014, what worked in its favour in the next elections was the support of Lingayats (20% or 3.5 lakh voters). BJP in 2019 also convinced Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) chief Prakash Ambedkar to contest. This helped divide Dalit, Muslim and Dhangar votes.“Congress candidates had traditionally got votes from Dalit and Muslim com munities in Solapur. But Ambedkar secured 1.70 lakh votes. That was a big blow to Shinde, who lost by a margin of 1.58 lakh votes,” a political observer said.But this time, the observer pointed out, BJP has neither fielded a Lingayat candidate nor is VBA in the fray. “Besides, there is a negative impression among people about the poor performance of the BJP MPs in the last two terms.”BJP is trying to woo the Padamshali community that controls most of the factories producing chaddars and towels. The community had given the party its first MP from western Maharashtra — Lingraj Valyal from Solapur in 1996. In his recent speech, PM Modi recalled his ties with the community. “During my childhood, a Padamshali family in Ahmedabad used to feed me three to four times a month. They were poor and used to live in a chawl. But they never let me sleep hungry.”BJP, too, never misses a chance to target Congress. Praniti, on the day she filed her nomination, brought the famous doppelganger of Shah Rukh Khan — Ibrahim Qadri — for campaigning. BJP’s national spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla was quick to write on X that after peddling fake surveys, Congress was using deep fakes, and called it another scam of the grand old party.",Solapur is traditionally one of the safest constituencies for Congress. Praniti Shinde is rubbing in the ‘no-development’ message. Solapur elected two MPs in the last 10 years. Data reveals that Bansode participated in just seven debates in Lok Sabha.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109899634,imgsize-1298716,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/109899634.jpg"

This completes the NA’s total strength of 336 seats.In March, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had ruled that SIC was not eligible for reserved seats and decided to distribute the seats among other parliamentary parties, with the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) becoming major beneficiaries. The verdict was rejected by PTI as unconstitutional and the alliance had filed a plea against the electoral watchdog’s decision in the Peshawar HC, but it rejected the appeal.In response, SIC moved the Supreme Court last month urging it to allot the party the reserved seats in the national and provincial assemblies and set aside the Peshawar HC ruling.Accepting SIC’s appeal for a hearing, the apex court clarified that the Peshawar HC order upholding ECP’s decision was suspended to the extent of the remaining reserved seats distributed among other parties.After losing the extra reserved seats, PM Shehbaz Sharif’s coalition government had lost its two-thirds majority in the National Assembly.","Pakistan’s Supreme Court suspended on Monday a high court verdict that a political party was not eligible for reserved seats for women and minorities.

Sunak’s party suffers heavy losses in UK local elections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/sunaks-party-suffers-heavy-losses-in-uk-local-elections/articleshow/109829279.cms,"LONDON: Britain’s governing Conservative Party suffered heavy losses in local election results Friday, further cementing expectations that Labour Party will return to power after 14 years in a UK general election that will take place in the coming months. Labour won control of councils in England that the party hasn’t held for decades and was successful in a special by-election for Parliament that, if repeated in the general election, would lead to one of the Conservatives’ biggest-ever defeats.Though the results overall, admittedly on a low turnout, make for grim reading for PM Rishi Sunak , he was able to breathe a sigh of relief when Conservative mayor of Tees Valley in the northeast of England was reelected, albeit with a depressed share of the vote.The victory of Ben Houchen , who ran a very personal campaign, may be enough to cushion Sunak from any revolt by Conservative lawmakers.For Keir Starmer , Labour Party leader, it’s generally been a stellar set of results, with the only real negative coming in some areas with large Muslim populations, such as Blackburn and Oldham, where the party’s candidates appear to have suffered as a result of the leadership’s pro-Israel stance in the conflict in Gaza.","Britain's governing Conservative Party suffered heavy losses in local election results Friday.

Saifai

, the native village of

SP chief

Akhilesh Yadav, for some time now. This is where a memorial and a towering statue of Akhilesh's father and party patriarch

Mulayam Singh Yadav

, fondly known as '

Netaji

', is proposed to come up soon.

""It is a prestigious project which will be a profound tribute to Netaji whose ideas are ingrained in everyone's psyche here,"" asserts Vikas Shakya, a small-time shopkeeper in Saifai, the powerhouse of SP politics in this Yadav-dominated region.

The town, situated around 15 km off the Lucknow-Agra Expressway, is part of Etawah district but comes under

Mainpuri Lok Sabha constituency

. The seat is currently represented by Akhilesh's wife

Dimple

who won the seat in 2022 bypolls which were necessitated following the demise of Mulayam.

She had then defeated

's Raghuraj Singh Shakya by a record 2.88 lakh votes garnering more than 64% of the total votes polled.

Dimple is back in the fray and up against UP minister Jaiveer Singh, a Thakur. So is her husband Akhilesh who will be contesting from Kannauj against BJP's sitting MP Subrata Pathak. Two of other Akhilesh's cousins, too, are gearing up for a contest from different constituencies in the region - Aditya Yadav (Badaun) and Akshay Yadav (Firozabad).

Akhilesh's another cousin, Dharmendra Yadav, is trying his luck from east UP's Azamgarh district which, too, has a sizable population of

Yadavs

and Muslims. BSP has fielded Shiv Pratap Yadav from Mainpuri, a move that could potentially nudge the SP, unlike in 2019 when BSP had cobbled up an alliance with the Akhilesh-led outfit.

""Hum sab Netaji ka parivar hi hain...yahan cycle ke alawa kuch nahi chalta (We are from Netaji's family.

Here nothing moves other than the bicycle),"" said Manik Chand Yadav who runs a small printing shop opposite a tall Hanuman statue constructed during the previous SP regime. The statue itself is a key landmark in the village, otherwise dotted with some of the key facilities, including

UP University of Medical Sciences

, a host of educational institutions and even an airstrip with the night landing facility.

Not surprisingly, for all practical reasons, Saifai has turned into SP's political headquarters for the past couple of months.

Be it Akhilesh, Dimple or their uncle Shivpal Yadav, they all essentially operate from Saifai - devising strategies and channeling the party's manpower to retain their political stronghold in the region.

Dimple has been moving from village to village reaching out to every section in Mainpuri, which goes to poll in the third phase. She is being assisted by her elder daughter Aditi who, too, is pulling all stops to ensure her mother's win.

The party has also roped in Saifai gram pradhan Ram Phal Valmiki, a Dalit, to garner SC votes in favour of the party.

""There is no denying that we are contesting in Netaji's name. He is the one who groomed the party and all of us,"" said SP's Mainpuri district president Alok Shakya.

The BJP, too, is going all guns blazing to turn the contest into a sharper square-off with the Congress-backed SP. While the party's campaign in Mainpuri and other SP bastions are being spearheaded by PM Modi, home minister Amit Shah, CM Yogi Adityanath and the saffron party workers carry out the aggressive ground-level spadework.

Around 40 km from Saifai, the Mainpuri assembly segment bustles with high-decibel campaign activity. A host of BJP's campaign vehicles armed with LED screens and campaign material move swiftly. ""Our target is to hold at least 10 small sabhas in each assembly segment,"" said a BJP worker entrusted with the task of coordinating with the campaign vans. In other stretches along Mainpuri, large trucks move around playing songs highlighting the achievement of the Narendra Modi government.

Jaiveer himself has set up a camp office in Mainpuri assembly seat which he represents as an MLA. A host of high-end SUVs bearing saffron flags wait outside the office as party workers with saffron 'gamchhas' (scarves) wrapped around their necks ferry bunches of campaign material. The office is primarily coordinated by Jaiveer's son Sumit whose wife Harshita is the zila panchayat member in Firozabad.

Akhilesh, a sitting MLA from Karhal assembly seat in Mainpuri, had first won from Kannauj in 2000 in a by-election after Mulayam vacated the seat to retain Sambhal.

Kannauj, too, happened to be the bastion of SP until BJP's Subrata Pathak breached it by defeating Dimple in a close contest in 2019 LS polls. Pathak defeated Dimple by a slender margin of 12,300 votes. The town which primarily boasts of being the hub of 'itr' (perfume) is getting a whiff of a tough contest between Akhilesh and Pathak. At the stake is the prestige of Akhilesh, who banks on his popularity as the archrival of BJP.

Pathak, on the other hand, tends to rely on his image of being a 'local' leader who can ""easily connect"" with the electorate.

""Whatever development happened in this region was only and only because of the Samajwadi Party. No one can ignore the fact,"" asserts Mahendra Singh Yadav, who runs a medicine shop in the buzzing market in Kannauj Sadar. Yadav recounts a slew of projects which were shaped up during Akhilesh tenure: ""Expressway, Lohia park, medical college, engineering college..

.the list can go on and on...,"" he said. Akhilesh is soon expected to start camping in Kannauj which goes to poll in the fourth phase on May 13.

Yadav's fellow shopkeeper, Vishnu Kumar Shukla, however, slams the previous SP dispensation accusing it of ""lawlessness"" and ""anarchy"". ""People haven't forgotten the previous SP days when we were forced to close our shops early in the evening,"" he said.

Etawah, which happens to be a reserved constituency, within the Yadav belt, too, is witnessing a close contest between the SP and BJP, even as the BSP seeks to make its presence felt.

The constituency is a mixed of rural and urban precincts with a distinct electoral bloc comprising Yadavs, Dalits, OBCs, Brahmins and Rajputs. The BJP, as a matter of fact, has been winning the seat since 2014.","Saifai, the native village of SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, is the powerhouse of SP politics in this Yadav-dominated region. The town, situated around 15 km off the Lucknow-Agra Expressway, is part of Etawah district but comes under Mainpuri. The seat is currently represented by Dimple Yadav who won the seat in 2022 bypolls.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109901280,imgsize-437535,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/109901280.jpg"

However, his decision to file his nomination before participating in the rally caused some confusion among supporters who were waiting at the party office and dancing to the beat of drums and tunes of songs customised for him. The huge crowd brought traffic to a standstill, with police and party volunteers struggling to manage the situation.Waving flags of Congress, AAP and CPM, several supporters claimed Kanhaiya would “give sleepless night” to his opponent Manoj Tiwari, the sitting MP from BJP, who had defeated Congress’s Sheila Dikshit in 2019 by a margin of over 3.6 lakh votes.Around 12.30pm, delayed due to snarls caused by his own rally, Kanhaiya reached the party office on foot. On seeing him, his supporters lifted him on their shoulders and began the rally — ‘Nyay ka Arambh’. Over the next few hours, the mass gathering, which stretched to over a kilometre, saw several DJs, hundreds of e-rickshaw drivers and JCB machines spraying flowers and party poppers. Supporters chanted slogans like “Abhineta nahi, beta chune” (‘choose son over actor’, a reference to Tiwari) as patriotic songs played in the background.Addressing the gathering, Kanhaiya called the BJP govt “a dictatorial regime” and asserted the “Constitution was in danger”. He made several references to Lord Krishna, drawing parallels from his life: “I am Kanhaiya Kumar, and Lord Krishna (Kanhaiya) was born in a jail. You (Modi) also sent me to jail…”Questioning his opponent’s achievements, he said, “It was reported he carried out work worth Rs 14,000 crore. But, can you see it?” He also asked: “Even 280 seats are enough to resolve the issues of unemployment and poverty. Why does this govt need 400?”Meanwhile, at Jamnagar House that houses the office of the returning officer of New Delhi LS seat, Anand arrived quietly with a few supporters, without any procession or sloganeering. Later, speaking to the media, he said he was contesting the election “to make people aware the lollipops being offered by some people in Delhi were of no use to them”. “Their foundation is being weakened. People should come out of this and support their own party,” the BSP nominee said.","Congress’s Kanhaiya Kumar and former Delhi minister Raaj Kumar Anand, who has joined BSP, on Monday filed their nominations from the Northeast Delhi and New Delhi Lok Sabha seats.

Bid to finish off AAP didn't work: Kuldeep Kumar

Kuldeep Kumar, an AAP leader, promises to address law enforcement, addiction recovery, and public facility development in East Delhi, emphasizing the fight against dictatorship and defending AAP leaders' arrests.

New Delhi: AAP minister Gopal Rai on Monday held public meetings in Laxmi Nagar and Shahdara and campaigned for Kuldeep Kumar , INDIA bloc’s candidate from East Delhi LS seat.Taking a dig at BJP, Rai said, “People of Delhi had trusted Modi and gave all seven seats to BJP. This time, they don’t want MPs who haven’t worked for them in 10 years. Delhi has decided to give all seven seats to INDIA bloc.” Kumar, on the other hand, had a proven record of working in his area as a councillor and an MLA, Rai said.Addressing the Sankalp Sabha in Laxmi Nagar, Rai said the entire country is waiting for June 4.“AAP and Congress are contesting the elections together. Ever since the poll process started, BJP’s only response to issues like jobs, inflation and atrocities on farmers has been the slogan of ‘400 paar’. Even after all these years, there are no answers to people’s questions. For 10 years, the youth, farmers, labourers and women of this country have seen their voices being suppressed by this govt. Now, people across the country are raising slogans of BJP’s defeat,” he said.People present in the crowd, including Kumar, took an ‘oath’ to “teach a lesson to BJP with their votes”.Delhi BJP vice president Yogita Singh slammed AAP, saying it had lost public support and was trying to rake up frivolous issues. “Rai should tell us why AAP is aligned with Congress, which curtailed rights during Emergency,” she added.“Central govt contributed to developing Delhi by setting up new schools and hospitals, and gave the city the best highway infrastructure,” she said.","Kuldeep Kumar, an AAP leader, promises to address law enforcement, addiction recovery, and public facility development in East Delhi.

Devendra Yadav appointed interim president of Delhi Congress after Arvinder Lovely's exit

Former Delhi Congress chief Arvinder Singh Lovely joins BJP

Arvinder Singh Lovely joined BJP from Congress, citing AAP alliance. Confident in BJP forming govt, he referred to Indira Gandhi and Tukde Tukde gang. He returned to BJP after a brief stint in Congress.

New Delhi: The Congress brass has ignored the rebellion of its Delhi unit members led by the defection of Arvinder Lovely and his confidants, laying great store by its decision to tie up with AAP and pick Kanhaiya Kumar and Udit Raj for two key city constituencies.Congress believes that choice of Kumar and Raj goes beyond the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, as they are at the heart of the party’s attempt to reorient the organisation in sync with the changing demographics of the city state that once had a distinct old Punjabi flavour.Quickly recovering from the Lovely shock, Congress appointed AICC functionary Devender Yadav as the city chief, and put the organisation back on the campaign trail. Interestingly, Yadav was against the alliance with AAP while Lovely single-handedly pushed for it, but now Yadav is working to oil the alliance machine in party’s interest while the former party head has joined the BJP.Sources said North-East Delhi was a difficult constituency where a conventional party face would have found it difficult to mount a campaign against popular Bhojpuri star in sitting MP Manoj Tiwari, while a non-Bihar-UP neta would have been a non-starter. Instead, Kumar, who has a personal name recall as a student leader, has gone headlong into the campaign, which is bound to force the BJP to take the rival seriously. Also, besides the presence of voters with UP-Bihar roots, there are areas with an influential community which identify themselves with the caste of Kumar.Though BJP is a frontrunner in Delhi, Congress believes that seamless support from alliance partner’s base can result in a good fight.Congress is also happy with the feedback on Dalit activist turned politician Udit Raj, stating that his identification with his community is complete and requires no patchwork. His only weakness are the statements about certain strong non-Dalit communities that he issued in the past.Sources said betting on Kumar and Raj goes beyond the LS polls, as Congress looks at spreading its net among Hindi heartland migrants and among Dalits, which are two social groups that have become influential in the identity politics of the city.“Earlier, Delhi had a strong Punjabi influence, but now we have to quickly move to other groups, and we need faces which can be the bridges with them,” a senior Congress functionary said.",Former Delhi Congress chief Arvinder Singh Lovely joined BJP from Congress.
