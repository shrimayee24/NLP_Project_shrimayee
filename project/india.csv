EC sources Monday said duplication of EPIC numbers was a legacy, with many such duplicate cards having been issued in some states/UTs between 2008 and 2013. This discounts TMC’s charge that duplicate EPIC numbers were a ploy of BJP to introduce fake voters in Bengal.A senior functionary told TOI that the 25-year problem of duplicate EPIC would be resolved by EC in three months, while reiterating that irrespective of an EPIC number, an elector linked to the electoral roll of a particular polling station can cast his vote at that polling station only and nowhere else.Meanwhile, EC sources said a BJP delegation will be calling on the commission on Tuesday to complain about the presence of 17 lakh bogus voters in Bengal.","EC sources Monday said duplication of EPIC numbers was a legacy, with many such duplicate cards having been issued in some states/UTs between 2008 and 2013.

Nadda flags oppn bid to raise matters via Rule 267

NEW DELHI: Led by Congress and Trinamool Congress, opposition parties Monday demanded a discussion in Parliament on alleged discrepancies in voter lists, with Rahul Gandhi raising the issue in Lok Sabha.Bringing up the matter during zero hour, Rahul said several states had found discrepancies in voter lists. “Voter lists are being questioned across country and the entire opposition has been demanding a discussion on the matter. Questions have been raised by opposition in one voice in every state, including Maharashtra,” he said. Congress, however, failed to bring it up in Rajya Sabha when party president Mallikarjun Kharge was not allowed to raise the matter.Later, Kharge posted on X, “The abrupt and unwarranted deletion of voters, presence of duplicate EPIC numbers, and other such crucial issues affecting integrity of our electoral process require urgent attention and discussion in Parliament.” SP, AAP and RJD too said it was an extremely serious matter and Parliament needed to take it up.TMC’s Saugata Roy demanded a thorough revision of voter lists, particularly ahead of assembly elections in Bengal and Assam next year. “There are some serious flaws. This has been pointed out with respect to Maharashtra, which had inflated voter lists. This was pointed out in Haryana. They are now trying to jump into Bengal and Assam where elections are due next year,” Roy claimed.Party MP Kalyan Banerjee sought action against EC and said the poll body had “failed” to conduct fair and transparent elections over the past few years.He said the West Bengal CM had already drawn the EC’s attention to numerous instances of “duplicate” voter cards.Leader of the House in RS J P Nadda Monday said govt is ready for discussion on any issue and questioned opposition’s intent over trying to raise matters through Rule 267 which calls for suspension of scheduled business to discuss urgent matters.He termed practice of opposition MPs giving notices under Rule 267 despite elaborate rulings by the chairman on the issue a “vicious design to demean Parliament”. Harivansh did not allow leader of opposition Mallikarjun Kharge to make his submission. Opposition MPs then protested for a while before walking out.Condemning the walkout, Nadda said opposition was not interested in debate and when their notices were rejected by the chair based on previous rulings, they wanted to give an impression that govt did not want to answer queries.“Govt under PM Modi is ready to discuss anything under this roof. But there are rules & regulations for debates in the House,” Nadda said, further adding that MPs will get an opportunity to raise their issues during the debate on Union Budget over the next 10 days.",Opposition parties led by Congress and Trinamool Congress demand a discussion in Parliament on alleged discrepancies in voter lists.

CHANDIGARH: Punjab BJP media in-charge Vineet Joshi Monday accused Aam Aadmi Party of “making attempts to wrongly influence the minds of young voters with the inclusion of questions in exams that evidently lead to answers that talk about policies and programmes of governing AAP”.Hitting back, AAP termed the allegations as “baseless” and slammed BJP for “attempting to create unnecessary controversy and mislead the public for political gain”.At a presser, Joshi referred to the political science question paper of Punjab School Education Board’s Class XII exam held on March 4, and said it asked about when AAP was established. “Similarly, a question asked students to describe policies and programmes of AAP,” Joshi said. “This is blatant misuse of office by AAP… The education department cannot act like a mouthpiece of the establishment. Minds of youngsters, potential voters, cannot be influenced using the crutches of the education department,” he added.AAP spokesperson Neel Garg, in a statement, stated, “The subject of Political Science naturally includes discussions on regional and national political parties as part of the curriculum. In previous years’ papers, questions about BJP and Congress were asked too.”",Punjab BJP media in-charge Vineet Joshi accused Aam Aadmi Party of ‘making attempts to wrongly influence the minds of young voters’ AAP termed the allegations as ‘baseless’ and slammed BJP for ‘attempting to create unnecessary controversy and mislead the public for political gain’,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118863450,imgsize-116380,width-400,resizemode-4/118863450.jpg"

JAIPUR: Rajasthan CM Bhajan Lal Sharma ignited a political controversy after allegedly referring to PM Narendra Modi as his “favourite actor” during an awards function Sunday night. Congress seized the comment to swipe at Modi, asserting that the CM confirmed what they had long maintained about the PM.BJP spokesperson Laxmikant Bhardwaj pushed back, claiming the question posed to Sharma was about his favourite “hero”, not actor. Sharma’s remark was made in response to a media query.“Question asked to the CM — ‘Sir, who is your favourite hero?’ CM’s answer—‘Narendra Modi Ji’… Congress members, having stooped to the level of a family’s feet, are unsuccessfully trying to continue their tradition of lies and deceit by editing videos and creating fake scripts,” Bhardwaj said.The controversy erupted after state Congress chief Govind Singh Dotasra shared a video clip of Sharma’s response on X. “We’ve been saying for a long time that Modi is not a leader, but an actor. Even if it’s late, the BJP CM has started saying that Modi is not a people’s leader, but an actor. He is skilled in camera artistry, teleprompters, costumes, and eloquent speeches,” he posted.Bhardwaj accused Congress of spreading “propaganda by editing videos”, arguing that millions of people see Modi as a hero. His rebuttal on X, however, came nearly eight hours after Dotasra’s post had already gained over 50,000 views.Adding to the controversy, LoP Tikaram Jully remarked: “Modi ji is not a chaukidaar (watchman) but a kalakaar (artist). We have been saying from the beginning that Modi ji is not a watchman, but a great artist. Today, Bhajan Lal Sharma, himself acknowledged that PM Narendra Modi ji is not a public servant but an #actor.”","Rajasthan CM Bhajan Lal Sharma ignited a political controversy after allegedly referring to PM Narendra Modi as his ‘favourite actor’ during an awards function Sunday night.
