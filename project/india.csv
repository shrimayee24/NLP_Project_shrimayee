Congress MP Hibi Eden submitted a notice to move a privilege motion against BJP MP Sambit Patra for his remarks calling LoP Rahul Gandhi “traitor of the highest order”. In his letter to the Speaker, Eden said by using “completely defamatory and unparliamentary words”, Patra has “clearly violated constitutional norms and should be held in contempt of the same”.He said Patra referred to LoP as “traitor” while making “unfounded allegations”. “Usage of such words against LoP, while being defamatory and unacceptable in public life, is also a complete breach of parliamentary privilege of the LoP,” Eden said. Congress hit back at BJP MPs for describing Rahul as “anti-national”.",Congress MP Hibi Eden submitted a notice to move a privilege motion against BJP MP Sambit Patra.

NEW DELHI: Though Mahayuti 2.0 began to unravel soon after Thursday's opulent oath-taking ceremony in Mumbai's Azad Maidan, some knots in the alliance still seem to remain intact as Shiv Sena leader Bharat Gogavale on Friday said Eknath Shinde has pitched for home ministry , which the BJP might not be willing to accommodate conveniently.""When Devendra Fadnavis was the deputy chief minister (in Shinde-led government), he also held the home department. Saheb (Shinde) has demanded the home and talks (on portfolio allocation ) are in progress,"" Gogavale told news agency PTI.Gogavale, one of few from Shinde's close circles, also said that cabinet expansion is likely to take place between December 11 and 16, just ahead of the winter session of the state legislature.The winter session of the legislature will start in Nagpur, the state's second capital, on December 16.When asked to whom Shinde has made the pitch for crucial home ministry, Gogavale said it was probably Prime Minister Narendra Modi or Union Home Minister Amit Shah .The MLA from Mahad in the Raigad district maintained that ""attempts are being made to change the portfolios held by the Shiv Sena in the previous Mahayuti government"".Devendra Fadnavis took oath as the chief minister of Maharashtra for the third time with a paradigm-shattering mandate as the BJP has won 132 out of the 148 seats it fought in the recently concluded state poll.After the oath-taking event, Shinde, who switched roles with Fadnavis, said that earlier when he was CM he considered himself a common man but now that he was deputy CM, he would consider himself a ""dedicated to common man"".The BJP emerged as the largest party with 132 seats in the 288-member House.

MUMBAI: Devendra Fadnavis ’s letter to governor CP Radhakrishnan stating he would take oath at 5.30 pm as CM along with two deputy CMs reached Raj Bhavan only at 2.30 pm Thursday, barely three hours before the actual swearing-in, as there was uncertainty until afternoon about whether Eknath Shinde would agree to be sworn in as deputy CM.Tension mounted in BJP camp in the absence of a letter from Shinde till Thursday morning; Shinde has been insisting on portfolios of his choice. However, in the morning, Shiv Sena ’s Uday Samant, Bharat Gogawale, Ravi Phatak and Sanjay Shirsat persuaded him to join the government as deputy CM, stating that the row over allotment of portfolios could be resolved at a later stage. Following their marathon meeting, Shinde agreed to take oath as deputy CM and a letter signed by Shinde was given to Fadnavis.It was then that Fadnavis sent his letter to the governor. Fadnavis could have sent his own name and that of Ajit Pawar on his own to the governor, but he waited for Shinde’s confirmation, sources said.Atop bureaucrat told TOI that the oath-taking event was confirmed only after written communication was received from CM-designate Fadnavis stating he along with Shinde and Ajit would take oath.Elaborating on what had happened earlier, the bureaucrat said that after the meeting of BJP legislature party Wednesday, a delegation comprising Shinde, Ajit and Fadnavis had called on the governor to stake claim for forma tion of the government. The delegation submitted a list of 237 MLAs supporting the Mahayuti. In addition, separate letters were given by BJP legislature party, Shiv Sena legislature party and NCP legislature party pledging support to Mahayuti government. Shinde and Ajit had earlier been elected as legislature party leaders of Sena and NCP, respectively.But in view of reservations expressed by Shinde over portfolios, no letter was given to Raj Bhavan stating Fadnavis would be leader of Mahayuti legislature party. During the interaction with media in the presence of Fadnavis and Ajit, Shinde was non-committal on whether he would join Mahayuti government as deputy CM. “There is no hurry, media will know by evening,” Shinde had said when asked if he would take oath as deputy CM.Sources said Shinde was hopeful he would get the portfolios of his choice and he was reluctant to join the government as deputy CM in the absence of any assurances in this regard.“All formalities were completed after Raj Bhavan received Fadnavis’s letter around 2.30pm, and the oathtaking took place as scheduled. Certainly it was a piquant situation, but there was no embarrassment, and the event passed off peacefully,” the bureaucrat added.Later at a presser, Fadnavis said about Shinde, “I am telling you 100% he wasn’t upset. Once I appealed to him, he accepted. When I was asked to be deputy CM after being CM, I was also reluctant. But I understood that without taking the post in an alliance government, there is a lack of coordination between the party & the government.”",Devendra Fadnavis’s letter to governor CP Radhakrishnan stated he would take oath at 5.30 pm as CM along with two deputy CMs. Tension mounted in BJP camp in the absence of a letter from Eknath Shinde till Thursday morning.

The crime

Special investigation team steps in

Broader context of women’s safety in Bengal

NEW DELHI: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday praised a POCSO court in Baruipur for awarding the death penalty to Mostakin Sardar , convicted of the rape and murder of a nine-year-old girl in Joynagar , South 24 Parganas . The verdict came just 62 days after the crime, a pace Banerjee described as “unprecedented” in the state’s history.Taking to X, Banerjee lauded the state police and prosecution team, stating, “Conviction and capital punishment in such a case in just over two months is remarkable. The government has zero tolerance towards offences against women and will ensure justice is neither delayed nor denied.”The Class IV student went missing on October 4 while returning from tuition classes. Her body was discovered the next day near a police outpost in Kultali, sparking public outrage. The sole accused, Mostakin Sardar, was arrested shortly after.The case gained national attention, with protests erupting over alleged police inaction. The child’s parents had to petition the Calcutta High Court for a magisterial autopsy, which was conducted at Kalyani JNM Hospital by AIIMS doctors.Responding to public anger, the state government formed a seven-member Special Investigation Team (SIT) to expedite the probe. Banerjee also set a three-month deadline for the police to resolve the case, emphasizing that ""a criminal has no identity"" and urging immediate action.The incident occurred less than two months after the rape and murder of a postgraduate trainee doctor at Kolkata’s RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, a case currently under investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). Opposition parties criticized the Trinamool Congress government, alleging a failure to curb crimes against women.","West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee praised a POCSO court in Baruipur for awarding the death penalty to Mostakin Sardar.

NEW DELHI: Rajya Sabha on Friday witnessed an interesting role switch with opposition members pressing for normal functioning of the House as BJP MPs vociferously demanded an investigation into the recovery of a wad of Rs 500 notes from the seat of senior Congress MP and leading lawyer Abhishek Manu Singhvi .As opposition MPs argued that protests were unnecessary as an investigation had already been ordered, BJP members, even ministers, pointed out that Congress itself never practised what it was preaching now.Soon after leader of opposition Mallikarjun Kharge said taking the MP’s name was not right before the probe was completed, Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar said, “When a matter is under investigation we should not be making a debate of it. I would greatly appreciate it if this is followed. I find this breach virtually every day, everything under investigation is subject to more investigation in our debates.”Amid the uproar, leader of the House JP Nadda accused the opposition of raising some issues with high intensity and ignoring others. As some opposition MPs urged the chairman to take up zero hour, Nadda said, “Today, you have so much concern for zero hour. Good sense should always prevail over the opposition."" He added, “Whether LoP's plea for restraint reflects an intent to pre-empt the investigation is something that must be kept in mind. The investigation should continue.”Responding to minister Piyush Goyal’s observation that a rule should be made that the opposition will allow the House to function smoothly and will not raise any matter that’s under investigation, Kharge said, “I only referred to the investigation ordered by the chairman. They should not be bothered. We are safe in your (chairman) hands.”Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju also said the opposition must give an assurance of not raising “unnecessary issues and fake narratives” to stall House business.","Opposition members pressing for normal functioning of the House.

NEW DELHI: Agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Friday assured that all (marketable surplus) produce of farmers will be purchased at minimum support price (MSP) - an indication that the procurement of all farm produce, whose MSPs are announced, would happen with further increasing its footprints beyond popular crops, including paddy and wheat.His remarks came on a day Congress MP and leader of opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi on social media said the govt should immediately implement all the demands of farmers, including a legal guarantee of MSP . His party later demanded that the PM invite farmers for talks.Reaffirming his govt commitment, Chouhan underlined that the govt will not only continue to fix MSP at more than 50% of the production cost, but also procure produce from farmers.Chouhan's assurance came in Rajya Sabha while he was responding to supplementaries during the Question Hour on the issue of MSP to farmers.At present, the govt announces MSPs of 22 crops and fair and remunerative price (FRP) of sugarcane. But procurement mainly happens for a select few, including paddy, wheat, cotton and sugarcane.In case of other crops, including pulses and oilseeds, the procurement is not as robust as the ones for paddy and wheat.Referring to the Congress-led UPA govt, the minister said, ""You did not purchase farmers' produce, we will purchase that and fix a higher MSP... When Congress was in power, they never purchased farmers' produce at MSP and farmers shed tears of blood, but for me 'kisan ki sewa' (service to farmers) is like 'bhagwan ki pooja' (worship to god).""Congress's Jairam Ramesh then recalled that Rajya Sabha chairman and Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar, while speaking at a ceremony to mark the centenary of ICAR-CIRCOT in Mumbai, had asked the minister about the promises made to farmers.Dhankhar, however, on Friday praised in the upper house the minister's commitments towards farmers' welfare, noting that the man (Chouhan) revered as the brother of 'ladli' (beloved) sisters will now also be cherished as the 'ladla' (brother) of farmers.Expressing his confidence that the ""energetic"" minister will fulfil his responsibilities in accordance with his name 'Shivraj', Dhankhar said, ""From today, I have given you a new name - Kisano Ke Ladle"".","Agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan assured that all (marketable surplus) produce of farmers will be purchased at minimum support price.

NEW DELHI: A controversy erupted in Rajya Sabha on Friday after chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar announced that a ""wad of cash"" was found on the seat allotted to Congress MP Abhishek Manu Singhvi .Dhankhar said the wad was found on seat number 222 during a routine ""anti-sabotage"" check on Thursday afternoon.With BJP and its allies demanding an inquiry, Singhvi termed the ""recovery"" from his seat ""bizarre"" and demanded a probe into what he described as a ""security lapse"". Denying that the money was his, he said, ""Hearing of it for the first time now. I carry one Rs 500 note when I go to RS. I went inside at 12.57pm and the House rose at 1pm, then I sat in the canteen till 1.30pm and then left.""""Of course, there should be an inquiry as to how people can come and put anything anywhere on any seat. It means that each one must have a seat which can be locked and the key can be carried home. Because anybody can do things on the seat and then make allegations about it. If it was not tragic and serious, it would be comic. Everyone should cooperate to get to the bottom of this. And, if there is a failure on the part of security agencies, that must also be completely exposed,"" Singhvi added.Dhankhar said he had ordered an inquiry since no one stepped forward to claim what looked like a ""wad of 100 notes of Rs 500"".Leader of opposition and Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge said he had no objection to the probe but the chair should not have named the MP as a probe was underway. Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju countered: ""The chairman has rightly mentioned the seat number and member's name. What's wrong with that? When we are going towards Digital India, is it appropriate to carry note bundles in the House? We don't carry notes in the House. We are only saying an investigation should be done. Why are they opposing it?""Leader of the House and BJP president J P Nadda called the incident ""extraordinary and serious"". He said it was an insult to the dignity of the House.","Congress MP Abhishek Manu Singhvi denies that the money was his. Singhvi calls the ""recovery"" from his seat ""bizarre"" and demands a probe.

Fast-track courts for cyber crime cases

HYDERABAD: Chief minister A Revanth Reddy Friday said police were allowed to function as per law by the Congress govt unlike the previous BRS regime which made them work under a lot of 'political pressure'.Taking part in ' Praja Vijayotsavalu ' at HMDA ground near Necklace Road organised by the home department, the CM instructed police to ""act tough and put behind bars political leaders and elected representatives if they try to throw their weight around.""""Friendly policing does not mean that only police will respect the elected representatives. Even the elected representatives should respect police. Redefine friendly policing by being friendly with victims and solving their problems. Protocols are not applicable to criminals and they should dread even the thought of police,"" the CM said.Asserting that the image of the govt was in the hands of police, Revanth said: ""Good work by police will earn a good name for the govt. The Congress govt has allowed police to work with self-respect.""Revanth's remarks assume significance in the backdrop of criticism that BRS leaders were being arrested following orders from the ruling party, including that of Huzurabad MLA Padi Kaushik Reddy's arrest on Thursday.Revanth asked police to show zero tolerance towards those who try to intimidate them. “Deal sternly with land grabbers, drug-related offenders, murderers, economic offenders and criminals, regardless of their power. Even if people’s representatives behave inappropriately, take action as per law,” the CM said. Referring to the protests by Special Police battalion personnel, he said if there was any problem, they should take it to the notice of senior officers or approach deputy CM.Revanth said the govt was planning to set up fast-track courts to dispose of cases related to cyber crimes and drugs within six months. He asked cyber crime police to identify personnel with technical know-how and engineering graduates and impart data analysis training and deploy them in cyber crime units.Revanth said the Telangana Narcotics Bureau should train officers effectively. “Police should look into the possibility of filing cases against the managements of schools and colleges if any of their students were found involved in drug cases,” he said.With Dec 6 being the Home Guards Raising Day, he announced enhancement of the daily honorarium of home guards from Rs 921 to Rs 1,000, weekly parade allowance from Rs 100 to Rs 200, Rs 5 lakh ex gratia to the families of home guards losing lives while on duty and home guards’ treatment under Rajiv Aarogyasri.

"TVK president Vijay stares down DMK, winks at VCK",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/tvk-president-vijay-stares-down-dmk-winks-at-vck/articleshow/116063767.cms,"Arjuna's arrow at DMK hits Thol, VCK to seek explanation

CHENNAI: Actor-turned-Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) president Vijay on Friday turned the launch of a book on B R Ambedkar into a political stage, attacking the BJP govt at Centre and the DMK govt in Tamil Nadu, besides making political overtures to VCK leader Thol Thirumavalavan, a DMK ally who was invited but stayed away from the event.Speaking at his first social event after TVK's debut public meeting in Vikravandi on Oct 28, Vijay accused the Union govt of inaction on the Manipur violence and the st-ate govt of failing to act on the Vengaivayal incident when a water tank used by dalits was contaminated with human waste. ""If Ambedkar sees it today, he will hang his head in shame,"" Vijay said to loud cheers from TVK cadres who had occupied much of the seats at Chennai Trade Centre. ""A permanent solution is simple: We need to elect a govt that truly loves the people.""Calling it ""anti-people"", Vijay said DMK is unable to ensure even basic social justice and security, but has expressed confidence of winning the 2026 election.Sharing a dais with TVK president and actor Vijay, VCK deputy general secretary Aadhav Arjuna on Friday attacked the DMK govt and ruffled feathers within his own party. VCK leader Thol Thirumavalavan later said Arjuna will be asked for an explanation for his statements which have been affecting the cohesion of the DMK-VCK alliance.Speaking at the launch of the book 'Ellorukumaana Thalaivar Ambedkar' (Everyone's Leader Ambedkar)', Arjuna took on 'dynasty politics', saying a chief minister should not be elected based on his birth, and the state must be ruled by leaders with ideologies.""Monarchy exists here. Dynasty politics must be abolished in 2026,"" he said.Speaking to reporters in Trichy later, Thirumavalavan defended the DMK govt. ""Democracy prevails globally, and monarchy was abolished ages ago. In Tamil Nadu, governance is executed by democratically elected representatives,"" he said. When asked about Arjuna's repeated criticism of DMK, the VCK leader said: ""It is true that his (Arjuna's) statements are causing confusion in the alliance. We will seek an explanation from him.""At the book launch event, Arjuna had hailed Vijay for his call for a coalition govt. ""We are yet to resolve the Vengavayal incident because of the election of MLAs and ministers based on caste lines. How can a party with a 25% vote share claim to be a major political party? Coalition govt must be formed in Tamil Nadu. If we question dynastic politics, we are branded as sanghis. Tamil Nadu people have decided to take a new political path,"" he said.Earlier in the day, Thirumavalavan said his decision not to share the dais with TVK leader Vijay was made with a sense of caution. He said the primary responsibility of the party is to keep the DMK-led alliance intact and thereby prevent 'sanatana forces' from gaining a foothold in Tamil Nadu. Recalling the developments, Thirumavalavan said he agreed to attend the event and receive the book a year ago when there were attempts to get chief minister M K Stalin and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi to participate. He earlier confirmed his participation after learning about Vijay's attendance but later expressed concerns to the organisers about potential political statements in the wake of Vijay's criticism of DMK at his Vikravandi conference.Thirumavalavan said opponents are busy trying to break the DMK alliance. VCK is of the view that it should not fall victim to the machinations of ideological enemies, he said. ""How can I give space knowing that political opponents are trying to use me as a tool to manipulate the political landscape,"" he asked.","Actor-turned-Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) president Vijay turned the launch of a book on B R Ambedkar into a political stage.

He said immediately after being sworn in, he asked lawyers to file a plea in court for an early hearing and get the stay lifted so elections can be held at the earliest.The Mahayuti has nearly finalised the numbers for the cabinet, and the expansion of the cabinet will be done before Dec 16, said Fadnavis. The cabinet will be a mix of experienced and fresh faces, he added.Discussions were underway on portfolio distribution. ""Our numbers have been almost fixed. We have done an initial discussion on portfolio distribution but not in depth because the discussion was on how many people should be sworn in,"" he said.In a series of media interviews, Fadnavis attributed the 5% surge in votes to the slogan Ek Hai Toh Safe Hai. ""During Lok Sabha, people realised they made some mistakes, and so people positively accepted the slogan Ek Hai Toh Safe Hai. People forgot their caste and voted decisively,"" Fadnavis said.He said Ajit Pawar said not to give the slogan Batenge Toh Katenge, give Ek Hai Toh Safe Hai. ""Some Muslims have voted for us. We have not discriminated against Muslims in the last 2.5 years. Maximum Muslim women have benefited from the Ladki Bahin scheme."" He added, ""Muslims do not vote for us because their leaders are afraid if the truth reaches them, they will have to shut shop. Hence, the leaders create fear among them. The realisation will come that they have to move with the mainstream.""He said there was pro-incumbency because of the welfare schemes, and it was a combination of the two that resulted in a huge victory.Fadnavis said Shinde agreed to join the govt when he met him and not at the last minute.On why Shinde was made CM in 2022, he said at the time Shinde rebelled and took a huge risk. ""It could have finished him politically. I gave the proposal to my party that he should be made CM. Since everything cannot be told to party workers, they asked why? But we managed to turn them around. If this time we did not take the CM's post, then party workers across the country would've been disappointed,"" he said.On MNS, Fadnavis said their ideologies largely match, and they would accommodate Raj Thackeray's party in local polls wherever possible.On the financial burden on account of welfare schemes, he said the debt-GDP ratio is 17-18% in Maharashtra. This would go up and require stabilisation of finances, which they would be able to do in 2-3 years.The govt, he said, took up the redevelopment of BDD chawls, Abhyudaya Nagar, Mhada layouts to provide affordable homes to the Marathi Manoos in Mumbai. The push for self-redevelopment received a huge response, he said. ""Atal Setu has opened up the hinterland for affordable housing. Towards Virar too, we can now give affordable homes."" He reiterated Dharavi would be redeveloped, and all those eligible up to 2011 will be rehabilitated in Dharavi itself and the ineligible would get rental housing.","Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said in a democracy, it is wrong that local body elections are not being held.
