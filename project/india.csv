NEW DELHI: Amid acerbic reaction from BJP netas to Rahul Gandhi’s tweet about “vote chori”, Congress Friday alleged members of the governing party are seeking a civil war by threatening violence and using unparliamentary words against opposition netas. It asked BJP to disapprove of the comments from its netas and lodge cases against them, else their remarks would be construed as being made at the instance of the PM and home minister.Congress spokesman and deputy leader of opposition in RS Pramod Tiwari said, “Is BJP seeking to incite civil war in the country? What are its netas saying?” Former BJP MP from UP and senior office-bearer Subrat Pathak said if people come out on the streets like in Nepal, they will burn down the houses of Rahul and SP chief Akhilesh Yadav. He also said if people (like Gen Z) come out in India, they will be chased in the streets.“This is the language being used for the leader of opposition in LS and a former CM. These are not good signs for the country, that senior netas of the governing party should be seeking to plunge the country into internecine violence. If the govt has any moral authority, it should lodge a case against such leaders,” Tiwar said.","Congress asks BJP to disapprove of comments from its netas and lodge cases against them.

Rahul trying to weaken democracy: BJP on 'vote chori' allegations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rahul-trying-to-weaken-democracy-bjp-on-vote-chori-allegations/articleshow/124009224.cms,"NEW DELHI/PATNA: BJP Friday accused Congress neta Rahul Gandhi of ""systematically and deliberately trying to weaken democracy in the country"" through his ""vote chori (vote theft)"" allegations against EC. ""Rahul is trying to create anarchy,"" senior BJP member Ravi Shankar Prasad told reporters in Patna.Referring to Gandhi's post on X Thursday, Prasad said, ""He wrote youth, students and 'Gen Z' will save the Constitution, protect democracy and stop 'vote theft'. What does he mean? He is simply trying to promote violence... this is highly condemnable."" Prasad claimed Rahul's repeated allegations against EC reflected Congress's lack of faith in Indian democracy.Rahul Thursday alleged names were deleted through software manipulation and fake applications in Karnataka's Aland assembly seat in 2023.""Congress is in power in Karnataka... what was his govt doing? The Congress candidate won from Aland and Rahul is raising questions about the victory of his own party MLA? The matter is pending before court,"" Prasad said.Referring to Rahul's mention of ""Gen-Z"" in context of ""saving"" the Constitution and democracy, Union minister Pralhad Joshi said the Congress neta was driven by desperation, and asserted India would never accept power gained through undemocratic means.

"Bihar polls: JDU, BJP likely to contest on equal number of seats",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-polls-jdu-bjp-likely-to-contest-on-equal-number-of-seats/articleshow/124009052.cms,"NEW DELHI: A few days ahead of announcement of Bihar assembly poll dates, NDA parties are on the verge of finalising seat-sharing arrangements. They expect a better performance than in 2020, when key ally Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) had contested independently.Home minister Amit Shah, who will steer the alliance strategy, held the first round of meetings with Janata Dal United boss and Bihar CM Nitish Kumar in Patna on Thursday. Deputy CM Samrat Choudhary, senior JDU netas Sanjay Jha and Vijay Kumar Choudhary also attended the meet.Alliance sources said the two lead allies are likely to agree on contesting almost an equal number of seats, while sparing a reasonable number for other partners, including Chirag Paswan's LJP (Ram Vilas), Jitan Ram Manjhi's Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM), and Upendra Kushwaha's Rashtriya Lok Morcha (RLM).Sources said EC is likely to announce Bihar poll dates in the first week of Oct. The BJP-led NDA aims at sealing the seat-sharing arrangements well ahead of that. ""All netas in the Patna meeting agreed to finalise seat-sharing in Sept,"" said a senior NDA member, adding that initial talks have been quite positive with no bottlenecks.Though JDU and BJP are likely to contest an equal number of seats, there is a possibility that JDU will take a couple of more seats to position Nitish Kumar's regional powerhouse as the lead party.Asked about NDA contesting the polls under Kumar, though there has not been a formal announcement he will continue as CM in case of the BJP-led bloc wins, the alliance neta said, ""A formal announcement is not needed as allies are contesting under Nitish Kumar, therefore, it is implied that he is the CM candidate too.""The 30-minute Shah-Kumar meeting was described by NDA sources as a courtesy call. Sources said of the 243 assembly seats, BJP and the JDU are likely to contest approximately 100-102 seats each and the rest will be spared for the three other allies with LJP (Ram Vilas) poised for a larger share.HAM neta and Union Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi has openly demanded 15-20 seats. LJP (Ram Vilas) has also sought ""respectable"" representation, with party's Jamui MP Arun Bharti hinting at a claim of 43-137 seats. However, alliance leaders have hinted that Chirag will get 20 seats, Manjhi 10-12, and Kushwaha's RLM seven.","NDA parties are on the verge of finalising seat-sharing arrangements.

"BJP neta's son fakes 'death' to dodge Rs 1.4 crore loan, held",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-netas-son-fakes-death-to-dodge-rs-1-4-crore-loan-held/articleshow/123986018.cms,"Vishal Soni fabricated his own death.

Neta's son also tried to stage kidnapping

BHOPAL: What began as a frantic river rescue in MP's Rajgarh district a fortnight ago, has unraveled into an elaborate fraud - Vishal Soni, son of Rajgarh BJP leader Mahesh Soni, fabricated his own death to evade Rs 1.40 crore in loans, sending police, administration, and SDERF teams on a 10-day, 20-km search of the Kalisindh River, even as he remained hidden in Maharashtra.The drama began unfolding on Sept 5, when police received information about a car sinking in the Kalisindh river. Divers retrieved the vehicle, only to find it empty. The car was identified as belonging to Vishal Soni, prompting a large-scale rescue mission. Following allegations of negligence by Vishal's father, three separate teams scoured the river for nearly two weeks, covering a 20-km stretch.When no sign of Vishal emerged after eight days, suspicions deepened. Station house officer Akanksha Hada obtained Vishal's mobile call detail records, which revealed his location in Maharashtra.Acting swiftly, MP police - assisted by their counterparts in Maharashtra - apprehended Vishal in the Fardapur police station area of Sambhaji Nagar district.During interrogation, Vishal confessed to owning six trucks and two public vehicles but being overwhelmed by debts exceeding Rs 1.40 crore.""I was told that if I got a death certificate, the bank loans would be waived,"" he reportedly told police.On September 5, at 5 am, Vishal collected money from his truck driver near Gopalpura, drove to the riverbank, switched off his car's headlights, and pushed the vehicle into the river before fleeing on the driver's bike to Indore. Reading newspaper reports of his own ""death,"" he traveled to Shirdi and Shani Shingnapur.When news reached him that police had traced his location, Vishal attempted to stage a kidnapping by tearing his clothes, rolling in dust, and filing a false report at Fardapur police station.Two days prior to his arrest, police had questioned Vishal's father and brothers, who admitted suspecting he was staying with relatives. Police noted that there was no direct constitutional provision to penalise a man for faking his own death, so Vishal was handed over to his family without a formal case.","Vishal Soni fabricated his own death to evade Rs 1.40 crore in loans.

Bihar assembly elections: Two more parties join Mahagathbandhan; seat-sharing deal to get complex?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-assembly-elections-two-more-parties-join-mahagathbandhan-seat-sharing-deal-to-get-complex/articleshow/123756184.cms,"PM Modi’s 'Kosi' Jibe at Opposition Ignites Bihar Election Heat During MP Flats Inauguration

NEW DELHI: The seat-sharing negotiations for upcoming assembly elections in Bihar have become more complex as two new parties - Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and Pashupati Paras's LJP faction - joined the Mahagathbandhan alliance. The situation is getting trickier as major parties are firm on their seat demands.The 243 seats will now be divided among eight parties -- Rashtriya Janata Dal, Congress, CPI, CPM, VIP, LJP (Paras) and JMM.“Two more parties are expected to be part of the INDIA bloc soon and we all have to sacrifice our share of seats to accommodate the new partners.” State Congress president Rajesh Kumar told reporters after a discussion during a key meeting of INDIA bloc leaders at the official residence of RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav.Meanwhile, Congress insist that it cannot go below the 70 seats.VIP chief Mukesh Sahani, on the other hand, has demanded “60 seats plus the post of deputy CM” while the CPI-ML is pressing for at least 40 seats, pointing to its past performance.The RJD is also unwilling to contest on fewer than 150 seats.In 2020 assembly elections, Rashtriya Janata Dal had contested on 144 seats, of which it won 75.Congress won 19 out of 70 seats.CPI-ML contested 19 seats and won 12.CPM contested 4 seats and was successful in winning 2 seats.CPI contested on 6 seats and won 2 seats.RJD's Tejashwi Yadav has already declared himself as the CM face of the opposition INDIA bloc.Addressing the rally in Ara town, the last stopover of the 'Voter Adhikar Yatra', Tejashwi questioned the Nitish Kumar government in Bihar for ""frequently copying his ideas"" and described it as a ""copycat government"". Ridiculing the government for copying his ideas, he said that at present he was moving ahead while the govt was behind him.""Tejashwi aage-aage, Sarkar pichhe-pichhe. Original CM chahiye ki duplicate?"" (Tejashwi is moving ahead while the govt is following him from behind.

Political theatre: Who will ‘caste’ vote for SP & BSP? Both begin to woo OBCs and Dalits,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/who-will-caste-vote-for-sp-bsp-both-begin-to-woo-obcs-and-dalits/articleshow/124009534.cms,"



LUCKNOW: In a rare practice on UP’s political turf in recent years, the two key opposition players — Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party — have expedited ground work ahead of the BJP, which is still awaiting organisational rejig, for the 2027 poll battle.The SP has shifted its focus to non-Yadav OBCs, targeting castes that either deserted the BJP during the 2024 LS polls or have had unstable equations with the party.Sources said SP leadership convened a meeting with OBC caste functionaries from Saini, Kushwaha, and Shakya communities earlier this week and directed them to hold PDA chaupals in their respective communities to draw them towards the party.Among those present in the meeting were an MLA from Saini community from West UP, an MP from Kushwaha community from eastern UP and an MP from Shakya community from West UP.Once the chaupals become successful, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav will address rallies represented by voters and supporters from these communities, party sources said.Similarly, the party has asked its Gurjar functionaries to step up outreach among the community through PDA chaupals which will later culminate into rallies to be addressed by Akhilesh Yadav.Sources said Gurjars, Kushwahas and Pasis have been growing distant from the BJP, especially since the 2024 LS polls and 2022 Assembly polls when Pallavi Patel won from Sirathu assembly seat (Kaushambi) on SP ticket, Babu Singh Kushwaha was elected MP from Jaunpur on SP ticket, and Awadhesh Prasad was elected MP from Faizabad (Ayodhya).To woo OBCs other than Yadavs, theSP thinktank has done mapping to identify such castes, sources said.Besides non-Yadav OBCs, the party is also trying to woo Jatavs along with Pasis — the two Dalit sub-castes. Since the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, when SP took its tally in UP to 38 seats with the PDA plank, the prevailing view in the party is that it can bring Jatavs and Pasis into its fold amid the dwindling electoral fortunes of the BSP.These efforts are irrespective of the debate that whatever shift was seen during LS polls among Jatavs towards INDIA bloc was primarily because of Congress being part of the alliance.Given its poor show at the hustings in recent years, BSP, too, has begun the spadework. The party is also wary of the SP’s Dalit outreach and its closeness with Congress — as seen during Lok Sabha polls and likely to continue even during 2027 UP polls 2027. Mayawati will address a rally of party workers up to the block level in Lucknow on Oct 9 on the death anniversary of BSP founder Kanshi Ram. The BSP chief has decided to mobilise the cadre with focus on consolidating the Dalit votes, a party insider told TOI.Interestingly, the BSP chief might also re-induct party members who left the party for some or the other reasons. All eyes will be on leaders like Swami Prasad Maurya, who was once a close aide of Mayawati.As part of meticulous preparations, BSP has assigned at least one bus for four assembly seats while party workers will make further arrangements for the transportation if the need arises to ferry cadre an supports to the rally ground on Oct 9.Sources in the party said BSP will blow the poll bugle on Oct 9 for the 2027 elections and might plan another bigger rally at Ramabai Ambedkar Rally Sthal in Lucknow.While the two parties have begun work at the grassroots, the BJP is yet to speed up. And when it does, UP’s poll turf, like always, will set up for an interesting contest in the 2027 hustings.","The SP has shifted its focus to non-Yadav OBCs, targeting castes that either deserted the BJP during the 2024 LS polls or have had unstable equations with the party.
