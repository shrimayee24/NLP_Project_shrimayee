Tejashwi Yadav's 'Name Missing' From Bihar Draft List Claim Prompts Forgery Probe By EC

Hand over your card, EC tells Tejashwi

Tejashwi's twin voter ID row

Conspiracy to defame India, BJP lashes out at RJD, Congress

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission on Sunday issued a notice to RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav after it was found that he allegedly has two different EPIC numbers, RAB0456228 and RAB2916120. It clarified that the EPIC number, RAB2916120, which the RJD leader mentioned in his press conference, was not officially issued and asked him to hand over the card for further investigation.Taking cognisance of his allegations, the ECI in its letter said, ""Upon verification, it was found that your name is recorded at serial number 416 of polling station no. 124 (located in the library building of Bihar Engineering University), and the EPIC (Electors Photo Identity Card) number is RAB0456228.""Also Read: 'This means he had two EPIC nos': BJP on Tejashwi Yadav's 'missing name' claim; asks did he have two voter IDs? The poll agency further added that the EPIC number mentioned by the RJD leader does not officially exist. ""However, as per your statement in the press conference, you referred to your EPIC number as RAB2916120. A preliminary investigation revealed that EPIC number RAB2916120 does not officially exist,"" it added in the letter.ECI further asked Tejashwi Yadav to provide more details of the EPIC card he mentioned in his press conference, so that further investigation can be done.Earlier on Saturday, the RJD leader in a press conference alleged that his EPIC number was changed and his name was missing from the draft electoral rolls in Bihar.However, ECI rejected Tejashwi Prasad's allegation, saying that he used the Electoral Roll with EPIC number RAB0456228 for filling his nomination papers on affidavit in 2020.The poll agency also clarified that Tejashwi's name is included in the draft voter list at serial number 416.ECI, in a statement, said, ""It has come to our attention that Tejashwi Yadav has made a mischievous claim that his name does not appear in the draft electoral roll. His name is listed at Serial Number 416 in the Draft Electoral Roll. Therefore, any claim stating that his name is not included in the draft electoral roll is false and factually incorrect.""War of words erupted between the ruling party and the opposition over the RJD leader's allegations. The chaos escalated after BJP lashed out at Leader of Opposition in Bihar Assembly, Tejashwi Yadav, accusing him of having two EPIC numbers and two Voter IDs.Addressing a press conference, Patra said, ""This means he (Tejashwi Yadav) had two EPIC numbers. Did he have two voter IDs? The way in which Congress and RJD are scathing an attack on the EC, is a conspiracy to defame India.""The BJP leader further asserted that both ECI and Patna District Magistrate clarified the matter by showing Yadav's name in the draft electoral roll.""He tried to mislead voters on the electoral roll published by the EC ... He cried that his name was not there in the electoral roll, so could he take part in the elections in Bihar?... After that, the EC and Patna DM revealed the truth. They said that Tejashwi Yadav's name and EPIC number are present, and his name has not been cut from the electoral roll published after the SIR,"" he said.""The EC further said that the EPIC number, which published his name in the electoral roll at serial number 416, is the same as the one he wrote in his nomination papers during the 2020 elections,"" the BJP MP added.He said, ""Sarvochh neta ke hain two EPIC number to karyakarta ka haal kya hoga"" (if the chief has two EPIC numbers, then what would be the condition of the party workers).","The Election Commission on Sunday issued a notice to RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav.

'Detonate It At Once’: Rajnath Singh Dares Rahul Gandhi Over 'Atom Bomb’ Vote Theft Claim

NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Sunday launched a sharp attack on Congress leader Rahul Gandhi , calling him 'anti-national' and accusing him of supporting only Muslims from Bangladesh and Pakistan, as reported by news agency PTI.Speaking to reporters during a election campaign meeting in the Bodoland Territorial Region, Sarma also claimed that the Congress party does ""not respect icons of Assam"", such as the Kamakhya temple and spiritual reformer Mahapurush Srimanta Sankardeva.""Rahul Gandhi is an anti-India person. He is only with Bangladeshi and Pakistani Muslims. He is not with Indian Hindus, not even with Indian Muslims. Rahul Gandhi is an anti-national personality,"" Sarma alleged.He did not provide any specific reasons for labelling Rahul Gandhi, the current Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha, as anti-national.Just days before, Rahul Gandhi had criticized CM Sarma during his visit to Guwahati. Speaking at a party event in Chaygaon, Gandhi accused the Assam chief minister of acting like a 'king' and predicted that he would eventually end up in jail due to corruption charges.“He thinks he is a ‘raja’, but he will not be in power for long.He will end up in jail — not because Congress wants it, but because the people of Assam will send him there for corruption.”In response, Sarma dismissed the allegations with a strong reply with words and a hand gesture ""Thenga"" during a late-night press briefing. He stated that unlike Gandhi, he is a true son of Assam, raised by its soil and people. He accused the Congress of being stuck in outdated thinking and added, “The joke is on him.”","Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma called Congress leader Rahul Gandhi 'anti-national' Sarma accused Gandhi of supporting only Muslims from Bangladesh and Pakistan.

"VP election: Uphill task for opposition in contest, bloc may field 'ideological' face",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/vp-election-uphill-task-for-opposition-in-contest-bloc-may-field-ideological-face/articleshow/123082011.cms,"Unity on consensus candidate will be challenge for the opposition camp

NEW DELHI: The opposition may field a strong ""ideological"" face as candidate in the vice-presidential election, as it looks to portray a strong contrast with the governing BJP's nominee to send out a political message across the country.Ahead of discussions on picking a candidate, it is felt that since winnability is an uphill task due to opposition's weaker numerical strength in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, INDIA bloc should use the vice-president (VP) contest to send out an unambiguous signal to its core constituencies of marginalised sections, including backwards and minorities, farmers, and intellectuals and the civil society.INDIA bloc is scheduled to meet Thursday (Aug 7), where Bihar assembly election is likely to be an issue as also the special intensive revision of the state's electoral rolls. The meeting, sources said, may also initiate a preliminary discussion on the likely candidate for the VP polls.At the meet, Rahul Gandhi may give a presentation on Congress 's ""research"" on voters' lists which he has said proves beyond doubt that the rolls are being tampered with to help BJP.The VP election has come prematurely after the controversial resignation by Jagdeep Dhankhar last month following an alleged confrontation with the govt over his decision to accept the notices to remove Justices Shekhar Yadav and Yashwant Varma.Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge Saturday alleged that Dhankhar was biased against the opposition, but he took one independent decision and it led to his downfall, as he accused the Modi govt of pressuring constitutional authorities.The opposition has been accusing the governing BJP of attacking constitutional values, secularism, fair elections, marginalised sections, besides weakening the economy and endangering the future of the youth. Some feel that an ideal VP candidate from the opposition camp should be able to represent these issues and send out a strong message.Such a move by the opposition, insiders argue, will hammer home the ideological distinction between BJP and the opposition parties, and help rally the base as the latter looks to build upon its gains in the 2024 LS polls.However, ensuring unity with a consensus candidate will also be a challenge for the opposition camp, where many partners compete against each other and are antagonistic.In the first vice presidential election held after BJP assumed office in 2014, Congress and opposition had fielded Mahatma Gandhi's grandson and known intellectual Gopal Krishna Gandhi to take on BJP's M Venkaiah Naidu in 2017. However, when the opposition witnessed fissures in its ranks in 2022, there was a paucity of candidates and Congress was forced to field a party leader in Margaret Alva to take on BJP candidate Dhankhar.","Opposition may field a strong ""ideological"" face as candidate in the vice- presidential election.

‘EPIC cited by Tejashwi not used in 10 yrs’

NEW DELHI: A day after top RJD functionary Tejashwi Prasad Yadav claimed that a search of Bihar's draft electoral roll with his EPIC No. RAB2916120 had found his name missing, only to be ""fact-checked"" by the Election Commission that his name and actual EPIC No. RAB0456228 were very much included in the voter list, the poll panel on Sunday said it had failed to find any EPIC No. RAB2916120 issued by its authorised officers in its records.On Sunday, the electoral registration officer (ERO) concerned wrote to Tejashwi, saying that upon preliminary investigation, it appears that EPIC No. RAB2916120 flashed by him at a press conference in Patna on Saturday was not officially issued.

It was this valid EPIC No. that he cited in his nomination papers/affidavit filed during the 2015 and 2020 assembly polls in Bihar.EPIC No. RAB2916120, which Tejashwi Yadav cited as ‘missing’ on Saturday, has not been used by him, at least for the past 10 years, said an EC source.In another case, EC has found that CPI(ML) Liberation MP Sudama Prasad’s wife Shobha Devi was registered as an elector from two different assembly constituencies (ACs) in Arrah, Bihar. The Left party is one of petitioners in the special intensive revision (SIR) case being heard by Supreme Court.Devi, as per documents seen by TOI, was registered with EPIC No. RGX3264140 at Lavarish Seva Kendra polling station in Arrah AC and under EPIC No. WVA0308544 at Samudayik Bhawan polling station in Agiaon AC. Her age cited in the two documents is several years apart.

CHENNAI: Congress MP R Sudha was robbed of a gold chain weighing more than four sovereigns during her morning walk in Delhi on Monday.In her complaint to Union Home Minister Amit Shah, the Congress MP from Mayiladuthurai, Tamil Nadu, described the incident as a blatant attack on a woman and a Member of Parliament in a high-security zone like Chanakyapuri, which houses several embassies and protected institutions.""It is highly shocking, to say the least.
