'Where Were Your Ancestors?' Gogoi Mocks BJP, Blasts Modi's Nehru Remark During Vande Mataram Debate

Vande Mataram

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Monday hit out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and accused him of using his speech during the Lok Sabha discussion on “Vande Mataram” to “rewrite history” and give a “political colour” to the debate.During the day-long discussion on 150 years of Vande Mataram , Congress deputy leader Gaurav Gogoi said the prime minister has a “habit” of bringing up Jawaharlal Nehru and the Congress in almost every speech, irrespective of the issue.""It seemed that your political ancestors participated in various movements against the British. So I saw the intention in the PM's speech to rewrite and revise history. The second objective was to give a political colour to this debate,"" Gogoi said.""He took Nehru's name 14 times and that of the Congress 50 times during the debate on Operation Sindoor . When there was a discussion on the 75th anniversary of the Constitution, Nehru's name was taken 10 times and that of the Congress 26 times,"" Gogoi said.Gogoi asserted that “no matter how much the BJP tries, it will not be able to put a single blot on the contribution of Jawaharlal Nehru.”Gogoi claimed that it was the Congress that truly gave “Vande Mataram” the prominence it deserved, adding that his party ensured it was not reduced to a mere political slogan but accorded the status of the national song.Gogoi said that “it was in the 1896 Calcutta session of the Congress that Rabindranath Tagore first sang ‘Vande Mataram’.” He added that Tagore had even written to Jawaharlal Nehru, saying, “the privilege of originally setting the first stanza of Vande Mataram to the tune was mine when the author was still alive.”The Congress MP further added that in the 1905 Banaras session of the party, Sarala Devi Chaudhurani also sang “Vande Mataram.”""An important amendment was made in this song which was that of population. The original song mentioned 7 crore, but in 1905, during the Banaras session, Sarla Dev Chaudhurani made it 30 crore and turned the focus of the entire country to Vande Mataram,"" Gogoi said.He noted that it was the Muslim League that had called for boycotting Vande Mataram. He recalled that “Congress’ Maulana Azad said, ‘I have no problems with Vande Mataram’. That was the difference between the Congress and Mohammad Ali Jinnah.”Despite pressure from the League, he said, the Congress decided at its 1937 session that the first two stanzas of Vande Mataram would be sung at national gatherings. He added that although both the Muslim League and the Hindu Mahasabha opposed the move, the Congress chose to follow public sentiment rather than their diktat.The Lok Sabha on Monday opened a special discussion to mark 150 years of, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi initiating the debate and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh scheduled to conclude it. The Rajya Sabha will take up the discussion on Tuesday, led by Home Minister Amit Shah.Framing the debate around what he termed the Congress’s historic concessions to the Muslim League, the Prime Minister accused the party of having “fragmented” Vande Mataram and undermined the spirit of the freedom struggle.","Congress deputy leader Gaurav Gogoi said the prime minister has a “habit’ of bringing up Jawaharlal Nehru and the Congress in almost every speech, irrespective of the issue.

Let's have debate on Nehru, close that chapter: Priyanka Gandhi

NEW DELHI: Opposition parties on Monday said the discussion on Vande Mataram in Parliament was timed for the approaching West Bengal assembly polls and that the govt wanted to divert attention from the problems people were facing.Participating in a discussion in Lok Sabha on 150 years of the national song, penned by Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra hit out at Modi, saying he is not the PM he used to be as his ""self-confidence was decreasing and policies were weakening the country"".The Wayanad MP also slammed BJP for targeting India's first PM Jawaharlal Nehru and alleged the govt wanted the debate to make fresh charges against those who fought for the country's freedom.The Congress MP also listed the ""chronology"" of 'Vande Mataram', citing Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose's letter to which Nehru replied, to rebut the PM's charge that Congress indulged in politics of appeasement over the national song.Modi ji mentioned a letter in the House, in which he said that on Oct 20, Nehru ji had written to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.But the PM did not mention the letter written on Oct 17, which Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose ji had written to Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru ji... PM Modi quoted one line of this (Nehru's) reply here, but the rest of what Nehru ji wrote was - 'there is no doubt that the present outcry against Vande Mataram is to a large extent a manufactured one by the Communalists. Whatever we do, we cannot pander to Communalist feelings',"" Priyanka Gandhi said.Referring to Modi's speech, she said, ""Since you keep talking about Nehru, let's do one thing, let's assign a time for a discussion, list out all the insults against him... debate it and let's close the chapter once and for all,"" she said, adding that ""after that, let's talk about today's issues - price rise and unemployment...The topic that we are discussing is part of the soul of the country. When we mention 'Vande Mataram', it reminds us of the history of our freedom struggle. This debate is strange; this song has made a place in people's hearts; so what is the need for a debate?"" Priyanka said. In 1896, Rabindranath Tagore sang it for the first time at a Congress session, she said.She added questioning the decision of having the first two stanzas of 'Vande Mataram' as the national song was akin to questioning the Constituent Assembly and its members.Congress deputy leader in LS Gaurav Gogoi said it is the PM's habit to keep referring to Nehru and Congress whenever he speaks on any issue. ""He (Modi) took Nehru ji's name 14 times and that of Congress 50 times during the debate on Operation Sindoor. When there was a discussion on the 75th anniversary of the Constitution, Nehru's name was taken 10 times and that of Congress 26 times.""""During the discussion on the President's address in 2022, he took Nehru ji's name 15 times. The PM, during the discussion on the President's address in 2020, took Nehru ji's name 20 times. I want to say with utmost humility to Modi ji and his entire system, no matter how hard you try, you won't be able to put even a single blot on Pandit Nehru's contributions."" Gogoi said the PM's speech had two objectives - ""to rewrite history and give a political colour to this debate"".","Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra hit out at PM Modi, saying he is not the PM he used to be.

Goa Club Fire Exposed Deadly Design Errors, Trapping Dozens As Only One Exit Functioned

PANAJI: The tragic death of 25 persons at Birch by Romeo Lane at Arpora on Saturday night could have been avoided if top IPS officers, serving and retired, posted in Goa had allowed local police to act as per the law.Two local police units, the Anjuna police station and crime branch, had issued notices to the owner of the club to submit the documents and permissions from authorities that allowed him to operate. However, senior IPS officers stopped Goa police from pursuing these notices, a senior officer aware of the investigation toldThese officers even pressured local police to close an FIR registered against Birch by Romeo Lane in connection with loud music, he said.During the 2024 Lok Sabha election, then Anjuna police inspector Prashal Desai was the first to seek information from the nightclub about the permissions issued to them by authorities, but a top IPS officer, who has now retired from service, stopped the local police from pursuing the issue.Within two months, crime branch deputy superintendent of police (DySP) Rajesh Kumar issued a notice to the club. In the notice, Kumar informed the club that he has been informed about their violations, and that they should personally visit the crime branch with all permissions they have received from the authorities to operate the club.Kumar, too, was stopped by the same IPS officer.Then, in Aug last year, Anjuna PI Paresh Naik registered FIRs against five nightclubs in the Anjuna area for allegedly playing loud music. The case was investigated by the then DySP (Mapusa) Sandesh Chodankar.A senior IPS officer told Chodankar not to have confrontation with the owners of the nightclub, while another officer pressured him to file a closure report.The officer said that if the call records of all IPS officers serving and those who served in Goa are obtained, one can directly link them with the owners of the nightclub.On Sunday, revenue minister Atanasio ‘Babush’ Monserrate raised the issue of whether govt would have suspended IAS and IPS officers involved in any wrongdoing in the state the way it acted against Goa cadre officers. His comments came after state govt suspended three govt officials in the wake of Saturday’s blaze — former director of panchayats Siddhi Halarnkar, former member-secretary of Goa state pollution control board Shamila Monteiro, and former secretary of Arpora-Nagoa village panchayat Reghuvir Bagkar.","Senior IPS officers stopped Goa police from pursuing these notices, a senior officer aware of the investigation told TOI.

'Suitcase politics': Navjot Kaur Sidhu’s allegations roil Punjab Congress; leader claims husband 'loyal soldier of party',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/navjot-kaur-sidhu-alleges-corruption-in-punjab-congress-claims-rs-5-crore-ticket-deal/articleshow/125858557.cms,"‘4 vying for CM post’

CHANDIGARH: Congress on Monday suspended Navjot Kaur Sidhu , wife of former Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee president Navjot Singh Sidhu, from the primary membership of the party with immediate effect. The move comes after she doubled down on her corruption charges against the senior Congress leadership in the state.Minutes after clarifying that her controversial remark suggesting that “Rs 500 crore in a suitcase is needed to become a CM in Punjab” was twisted out of context, Navjot Kaur unleashed a fresh volley of allegations against the senior party leaders.In an interview with a television channel, Kaur accused PPCC president Amrinder Singh Raja Warring and leader of opposition Partap Singh Bajwa of taking Rs 5 crore from the Tarn Taran byelection party candidate Karanbir Singh Burj in exchange for allotting the ticket. Burj finished fourth behind an independent candidate. She claimed the seat was originally promised to Ranjit Singh Rana of Gandiwind, from whom Rs 3 crore was allegedly sought. He refused to pay and was denied the nomination, she alleged. Gandiwind later joined BJP.Making fresh allegations, Kaur accused former deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, All India Congress Committee in-charge of Rajasthan, of taking money for ticket allocations in Rajasthan.She also alleged that Randhawa had links with a gangster.Accusing these party leaders of having an understanding with AAP and BJP, Kaurclaimed they held meetings with functionaries of the two parties to ensure no cases were lodged against them. “I am not levelling allegations against the entire top leadership but against these incompetent leaders who are ruining the party,” she said. She added she would seek action against them and would place proof before the high command.Kaur claimed that seniorAkali leader Bikram Singh Majithia was willing to share with her a list of Congress leaders who allegedly distributed money to ensure the defeat of her family in past elections. She claimed that these leaders played a role in the defeat of Sidhu in the last assembly elections and fielded multiple candidates on several seats to restrict the Congress tally to 15.Commenting on the state of party leadership, she said there were four claimants for CM’s post, including Randhawa, Charanjit Singh Channi, Bajwa, and Amrinder Singh Raja Warring. She said the Congress had bright chances of winning the next assembly polls provided it fought as a united force. The party, she said, should present a clear CMface. Calling her husband a loyal soldier of Congress and Priyanka Gandhi, she said he would remain with Congress and continue his TV work.On allegations of links with BJP, she said no member of their family ever met a BJP leader outside official work. Rejecting accusation that they were a sleeper cell of BJP, she said they never met the BJP or the AAP.",Navjot Kaur Sidhu is the wife of former Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee president Navjot Singh Sidhu.
