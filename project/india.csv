‘Have immense respect for Police’: Delhi CM Rekha Gupta clears air on ‘thulla’ controversy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/i-dont-mind-accepting-my-mistakes-delhi-cm-rekha-gupta-clarifies-thulla-remark-says-shes-not-fool-proof/articleshow/120153822.cms,"Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta speaks during an interview with PTI, in New Delhi.

Poll How do you feel about Rekha Gupta's admission of past errors? I think it's too late I appreciate her honesty

‘I’m not the same person I was years ago’

Posters off, apologies on

NEW DELHI: Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta has broken her silence on the backlash over her use of the word “thulla” in the Assembly last month, saying it was never meant to insult police personnel. In an interview with PTI, the 50-year-old leader acknowledged the criticism, admitted past errors, and said she’s “not fool-proof” but willing to evolve.“I used the word ‘thulla’ while narrating a story. It was not my intention to harm police personnel or jawans,” she said. “I have immense respect for them. They work 24 hours a day, often without rest or food, always just a phone call away.”The term “thulla” is commonly used as street slang to refer to beat cops in a derogatory manner. Gupta’s remark, made during a March 28 Assembly session, sparked sharp reactions from the Aam Aadmi Party, which called it an insult to the force.But Gupta, who led the BJP to power in Delhi after 26 years, is not shying away from accountability. “Sometimes we commit mistakes without any intention. What’s important is to accept them and ensure they are not repeated,” she said. “I don’t mind accepting my mistakes.”Responding to questions about her earlier aggressive posts on social media targeting opposition leaders, Gupta chalked them up to immaturity. “When we’re younger, we lack command over our language… as we grow, we mature,” she said. “It happens in everyone’s life. I’m no exception.”She added, “I’m a person who convinces others or gets convinced by them. I don’t believe in one-sided thinking.”In a candid admission, Gupta acknowledged that her own supporters may have contributed to the defacement of Delhi’s public walls with political posters in the past—something she’s now campaigning against.“When I realised how ugly Delhi looks with posters and wall-writings, I started by apologising to the people,” she said. “I’ve now asked all our MLAs and workers to stop this practice. We must move toward a clean and beautiful Delhi.”Gupta said she doesn’t see herself as a one-woman force trying to change the capital. “The vision for Viksit Delhi, Swachh Delhi, Swasth Delhi—it’s not just my mission. Every citizen must be a part of it.”","Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta has broken her silence on the backlash over her use of the word “thulla” in the Assembly last month.

"We've rights too, says ED; Be sensitive to others' rights: SC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/weve-rights-too-says-ed-be-sensitive-to-others-rights-sc/articleshow/120185038.cms,"NEW DELHI: Courts are deluged with writs seeking protection of rights. But the one which turned up before Supreme Court bench of Justices Abhay Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan a few days ago grabbed attention because it fell in the 'rarest of rare' category. It was filed by Enforcement Directorate which has been at the receiving end of rights-enforcement petitions.Though the anti-money laundering agency, through additional solicitor general S V Raju, withdrew the plea Tuesday, it will go down in court records for its extraordinariness. Appearing before the bench, Raju argued that ED also had rights. ""We expect you to be sensitive also to the rights of others,"" the bench reparteed on a lighter note.ED had filed the petition against alleged non-cooperation of Chhattisgarh police with its probe into the Rs 2,100 crore liquor 'scam' that unfolded under the then Bhupesh Baghel-led Congress govt in state. The plea was withdrawn, sources said, because Chhattisgarh police's approach changed after Congress's defeat in assembly polls. In fact, a subsequent affidavit filed by Chhattisgarh govt in Aug 2024, (after formation of a BJP govt in state), supported ED's allegation of nexus between Economic Offences Wing of Chhattisgarh police and one of the principal accused in the liquor 'scam', IAS officer Anil Tuteja .In its now-withdrawn petition, ED had cited ""evidence"" to claim that Chhattisgarh police had not just shared drafts of reports on the status of its investigation with Tuteja but had also agreed to carry out changes suggested by him. ED went on to say that Chhattisgarh police influenced a witness to retract his statement under PMLA. ""The purpose of sharing the draft (SIT report) was to seek approval from the accused persons before the same could be filed before (Chhattisgarh) HC,"" the fresh affidavit said.ED arrested Tuteja on April 21, 2024, after the agency claimed (in its remand note) that it had recovered digital evidence of the IAS officer allegedly receiving over Rs 14 crore from proceeds of crime. The agency subsequently seized Rs 16 crore of assets allegedly linked to Tuteja and his associates out of about Rs 200 crore of total attachments in the case. ED had submitted ""evidence"" of regular contact between Chhattisgarh police and Tuteja, including a WhatsApp chat purportedly between the IAS officer's son and and one of the members of the SIT, with the former sharing the advice of his father's counsel on how to draft the report on the status of investigation.In another purported exchange with Tuteja Jr, the then head of EOW and Anti-Corruption Bureau discussed ""efforts"" to influence witnesses to get them to depose in favour of the IAS officer.""The chats reveal role of successive chiefs of EOW/ACB in diluting the case against prime accused of predicate offence, Anil Tuteja and Alok Shukla,"" the affidavit said, adding ""the draft report of SIT was vetted by the prime accused, Anil Tuteja, with the help of his advocate Peeyush Bhatia"".The affidavit also mentioned role of advocate general under Congress govt.","ED had filed the petition against alleged non-cooperation of Chhattisgarh police with its probe into the Rs 2,100 crore liquor'scam' That unfolded under the then Bhupesh Baghel-led Congress govt in state.
