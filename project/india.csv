BJP faces tough test in 2-match series: Resurgent Congress will try to wrest Haryana,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-faces-tough-test-in-2-match-series-resurgent-congress-will-try-to-wrest-haryana/articleshow/112576104.cms,"NEW DELHI: Haryana will be a keenly watched battle where a resurgent Congress will seek to oust BJP after a decade out of power in what was its bastion till the advent of Narendra Modi on the national scene.BJP spotted signs of strong anti-incumbency , built around jobs, prices and law and order, ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, and effected correctives by replacing chief minister M L Khattar with Nayab Singh Saini .But the party could not stave off the Congress which won five of the ten seats, a major shift after having been reduced to zero in 2019 and just one in 2014.The immediate backdrop of the battle is the reason why Congress is gung ho about its prospects, with party leaders even predicting a landslide.After Congress lost the assembly owing to decade-long anti-incumbency barely months after Modi wave installed the BJP government at the Centre, the state has been decoupled from the central scene. Barely had the state voted overwhelmingly for BJP in the post-Pulwama 2019 Lok Sabha elections that it nearly shocked the party in vidhan sabha. BJP was stopped at 40 seats and had to tie up with JJP to form the government. This time, Congress goes into the polls having won half of the Lok Sabha seats, and that too in an election where polarising factors like Ayodhya were in full play.Post-2024, the main rivals have been trying to adjust the factors to their advantage. Congress led by Bhupinder Hooda has been on a non-stop campaign across the state, beefed up by statewide yatra by Deepender Hooda and a separate one focussed on urban seats by senior MP and Dalit face Kumari Selja. Congress is a divided house in the state, but insiders exude confidence that it would not come in the way of aggregating the voters for the party.BJP, on the other hand, is banking on the new variable that it inserted in the Haryana politics in 2014 with the formulation ""35 qaum ka chunav"" - an allusion to the strategy of polarisation against the dominant Jat community. It served it well in 2014 assembly polls and then 2019, and its traces can be found in its continuing influence over Yadav and Punjabi community and strength in the urban centres. The idea behind replacing Khattar with OBC Nayab Saini is also designed as part of the same plan.However, Congress and Hooda have claimed that the BJP gambit would be a non-starter and the state is united against the BJP's failure on jobs, prices, law and order, and governance. The party's confidence is evident from its refusal to tie up with AAP or any other party, while it has been making populist promises to cut household spendings like subsidised LPG. Agniveer is another source of resentment Congress is pressing on.Ultimately, BJP is relying on a multi-cornered contest and the presence of JJP, INLD and AAP splitting the anti-incumbency votes. But Hooda said the Lok Sabha polls have proven that Haryana assembly will be a direct fight between the BJP and the Congress, and there is no space for a third player, unlike 2019 when the INLD splinter outfit led by Dushyant Chautala hurt the Congress.BJP has also been preparing to shore up its organisational set-up down to the booth level, and started preparations in earnest immediately after the Lok Sabha results on June 4. Home minister Amit Shah has visited the state twice and also launched the party campaign.","Haryana will be a keenly watched battle where a resurgent Congress will seek to oust BJP.

"Assembly elections in Haryana, J&K: Stage set for first BJP vs Congress electoral battle after 2024 Lok Sabha polls",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/assembly-elections-in-haryana-jk-stage-set-for-first-bjp-vs-congress-electoral-battle-after-2024-lok-sabha-polls/articleshow/112574290.cms,"Jammu & Kashmir

NEW DELHI: The stage is set for the first big electoral faceoff between the BJP-led NDA and the Congress-led INDIA bloc after the 2024 Lok Sabha elections with the Election Commission on Friday announcing dates for assembly elections in Haryana and Jammu and Kashmir The BJP has a lot at stake, especially in Haryana, where it is seeking a third term in office under chief minister Nayab Singh Saini - who replaced Manohar Lal Khattar in March this year.The fact that the BJP had to change its chief minister of nearly 9 years in an election year speaks volumes about the party's ground assessment of situation in the state.If the Lok Sabha election results in the state is any indication to go by, the BJP is on a sticky wicket. It's tally in the Lower House was reduced by half as the party managed to win only 5 of the 10 seats in Lok Sabha elections. Clearly, the last-minute change of leadership did not help to prevent the slide.In 2019 also, the party had fallen short of majority winning only 40 seats but managed to stich post poll alliance with Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) to form its government for second consecutive term. However, the alliance ended on a bitter note earlier this year and JJP leader and former deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala has announced that he is ready for contest on all the 90 seats.""The new CM has only made announcements in the last 74 days which has taken the state backwards. The public will take accountability, they have seen it all. People have made up their minds,"" Chautala said.Clearly, Nayab Saini has an uphill task at hand as he tries to recover lost ground for the BJP. With 10 years in power, the BJP faces anti-incumbency. Also, the party would hope that there are no negative fallouts of Centre's handling of the farmers agitation.The Congress on the other hand is confident of a good show. In 2019, the party managed to win 30 seats, 10 less than the BJP. The party is already running an aggressive campaign 'Haryana Maange Hisab' against the BJP government and is confident that people will vote for change.Congress leader and former state chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda said: ""People were waiting for the poll date to be announced. We will form government with an overwhelming majority and the BJP will be ousted from power.""However, one of the biggest challenges that Congress faces is of factionalism in the party's state unit with several strong contenders vying for prominence.The Congress has made it clear that it will not ally with any INDIA bloc party in the state, which means that Arvind Kejriwal's AAP will try to make this a three-cornered contest.Then there is Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) which will be contesting the Haryana polls in alliance with Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP). In the last elections the BSP had garnered over 4% of votes, though it could not win any assembly seat.In J&K, the BJP would hope to make some significant gains, especially in the Jammu region. Assembly elections will be held in Jammu and Kashmir after nearly a decade in three phases from September 18, allowing people of the Union Territory to elect a government after the scrapping of Article 370 in 2019.Union home minister Amit Shah said polls in J&K will further strengthen the roots of democracy and open the doors to a new period of development for the Union Territory.""In the last 10 years, the Modi govt through a series of relentless initiatives, has created a new era of peace, development and strengthening democracy in J&K,"" Shah wrote on X.The BJP would hope that the recent spike in terror incidents would not hamper its electoral prospects in the state.Almost all major parties have welcomed the EC's announcement of poll schedule in the state.The apex court had set September 30 as the deadline for assembly elections in the UT.Mehbooba Mufti's PDP alleged that the LG administration was full of prejudice and bias and was working to favour the BJP. “PDP welcomes this move but we have a few questions. Why were elections not held on time? Why did it take so much time?” Mehbooba Mufti’s daughter Iltija Mufti said.The National Conference will be led by party chief Farooq Abdullah in the elections and not his son, Omar Abdullah, who has opted to refrain from participating until Jammu and Kashmir's statehood is restored. Farooq Abdullah called for a level playing field for all political parties in the region as he alleged that the BJP -- the ruling party at the Centre -- held ""disproportionate advantages"".The Congress on the other hand made a significant organisational reshuffle ahead of the assembly polls as it appointed Tariq Hameed Karra as president of its Jammu and Kashmir unit. Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge also appointed two working presidents for Jammu and Kashmir -- Tara Chand and Raman Bhalla.The Congress has announced to make statehood a poll issue. However, it will be important to see if the grand old party manages to stitch alliance with any of the two regional parties - PDP and NC - who are part of the INDIA bloc at the national level.The grand old party has accused the Modi government of trying to control the revived state administration of Jammu and Kashmir by giving more powers to the LG in July this year.",The Election Commission on Friday announced dates for assembly elections in Haryana and Jammu and Kashmir. The stage is set for the first big electoral faceoff between the BJP-led NDA and the Congress-led INDIA bloc after the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. The BJP is seeking a third term in office under chief minister Nayab Singh Saini.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112574544,imgsize-1214836,width-400,resizemode-4/112574544.jpg"

There has long been a buzz that the ruling party may appoint a "" working president "" before a full-fledged president is formally elected.With incumbent president J P Nadda joining the Modi-led government as a Cabinet minister, he is expected to be replaced as per the party's convention of ""one person one post"" although there have been exceptions like G Kisahan Reddy, who continues to be party's Telangana state chief even as he continues to be a cabinet minister in Modi govt.Although the ""technical process"" to elect the new national president is said to be kickstarted, there is no clarity about the likely options unlike 2019 when Nadda had emerged as frontrunner as successor to the then party president Amit Shah at the helm of the party after he did not join the Modi 2.0 govt.Nadda was first appointed as working president in June 2019 before he was formally elected as president in Jan 2020.

Will ensure all candidates get security: Election Commission,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-ensure-all-candidates-get-security-election-commission/articleshow/112576737.cms,"Will ensure all

candidates

get security: EC

NEW DELHI: The announcement of assembly elections in J&K came amid a recent surge in terror activity, particularly in Jammu region. But with MHA backing the deployment of a large number of security forces, EC, recognising the enthusiasm among J&K voters to be agents of change by choosing the ballot over bullets and boycotts, has decided to proceed with the exercise with some meticulous planning.The schedule has been carefully designed to keep the polling period short and ensure adequate availability of forces soon after announcement of poll dates.The election schedule also looks to cover the areas with heightened terrorist activity in the initial phases to ensure optimum force deployment and area domination, and schedule polling in constituencies across both J&K regions in each phase.TOI has learnt that credible inputs have been landing on intelligence agencies' desk about designs by Pakistan-based elements to disrupt the upcoming assembly polls in J&K with attacks on security forces and candidates. Sources said the Election Commission , with the cooperation of the home ministry, nevertheless chose to take a measured risk to hold polls with the underlying principle that such nefarious designs should not be allowed to succeed.The poll process starts a day after the conclusion of Amarnath Yatra on Aug 19, since that would free up a good chunk of forces for election deployment. Also, the final rolls with July 1, 2024, as reference date would be published on Aug 20.""We have not wasted a single day. Also, the poll panel has ensured that districts that have attacks over the past couple of months - like Doda, Ramban, Kulgam and Anantnag - go to polls in the first phase itself, with Rajouri and Poonch too scheduled in the second phase,"" an EC functionary told TOI.Interestingly, the polls are being held amid the apple/saffron season and will coincide with tourist festivals, which underlines the confidence of EC in going ahead with the exercise. CEC Rajiv Kumar on Friday said the EC will ensure that each candidate gets security and shall also honour J&K parties' request that security of all candidates and party office bearers be on par. About 16,000 or more security personnel may be deployed for this purpose, as per sources. For the first time, the EC has taken care to schedule polls together in constituencies across both Jammu and Kashmir valleys. Polling will be spread over three phases covering all of 14 days - as per an EC functionary, this is the shortest poll window in J&K, barring the 1987 exercise.""The EC is conducting the assembly polls buoyed by its confidence in the people of J&K who are not only keen on change but also want to be agents of that change by choosing ballot over bullet and boycott,"" the CEC said on Friday.Citing the record turnouts in J&K in the recent Lok Sabha polls, the CEC said, ""Time has come to erect the building on the solid foundation that was laid during the 2024 general election.""","The announcement of assembly elections in J&K came amid a recent surge in terror activity, particularly in Jammu region.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission on Friday announced assembly elections in Jammu & Kashmir and Haryana , ending a 10 year-wait for political parties since the last state elections and honouring Supreme Court 's September 30 deadline. This will be the first-ever assembly election in J&K since the nullification of Article 370 and its reorganisation as a Union Territory .Staggered over just three phases, the upcoming J&K poll is perhaps the shortest in several decades, with polling to be conducted over a 14-day period between September 18 and October 1.Haryana will see a single-day poll on October 1. Counting for both J&K and Haryana will be held on October 4, chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar, flanked by election commissioners Gyanesh Kumar and S S Sandhu, said at the press conference here. Assembly elections in Maharashtra, which were held along with Haryana in 2019, will be announced later due to security requirements for J&K, he added.Congress will look to preempt a BJP hat-trick in Haryana, and pull off a good show in J&K, where leading local parties National Conference and People's Democratic Party are its allies in INDIA but are likely to fight solo.BJP is banking on its course correction with the appointment of Nayab Saini as Haryana CM and its narrative of development post-370 to boost its performance and blunt the opposition's claims of a loss of face and numbers in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.The shortened poll schedule is not the only first in regard to J&K. This is also the first polls after the implementation of ST quota in assembly seats post-abrogation of Special Status on August 5, 2019. J&K will become the third UT, after Delhi and Puducherry, to have an elected assembly. The strength of J&K assembly has grown to 90 from 83 since the last polls, with Jammu region getting six of the seven additional seats. Nine seats almost a tenth of the total strength have been reserved for Scheduled Tribes; six of these seats are in Jammu. Seven seats, all in Jammu, are reserved for Scheduled Castes.While upholding the Article 370 abrogation and reorganisation of J&K last year, Supreme Court had directed EC to hold polls in the UT by September 30. CEC Kumar said given the window available after the completion of Amarnath Yatra, polls were being held ""well within the time period"".By scheduling polls in J&K despite the recent uptick in terrorist activity, EC is taking a measured risk, guided by the consideration that the postoponment of polls because of the spike in terror could only embolden Pakistan which is suspected to have re-activated its jihadi proxies, this time largely in Jammu region. There will be enough forces on poll deployment and security given to all candidates, as assured by the Union home ministry in discussions with EC.""The EC will ensure that all layers of democracy are strengthened with high participation of people as well as candidates, more campaign rallies and meetings and wider use of IT apps like CVigil and Suvidha,"" CEC Kumar said. He added that said EC’s confidence lies in the people of J&K who are keen on change and also want to be agents of that change by choosing ballot over bullet and boycott.Citing the record turnouts in J&K in the recent Lok Sabha polls, the CEC said, “Time has come to erect the building on the solid foundation laid during the 2024 general election”. Polls represent an opportunity to key regional players of J&K, National Conference and PDP, which will seek to return to office after their near-marginalisation in the six years of central rule.Haryana is set for a triangular electoral contest among BJP which will look to beat incumbency; a resurgent Congress buoyed by its improved Lok Sabha tally; and AAP that is in office in neighbouring Punjab and Delhi","J&K assembly has grown to 90 from 83 since the last polls, with Jammu region getting six of the seven additional seats. This is also the first polls after the implementation of ST quota in assembly seats post-abrogation of Special Status on August 5, 2019.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112576326,imgsize-1288853,width-400,resizemode-4/112576326.jpg"

RAIPUR: All in the name of the cow, the Chhattisgarh Congress staged a quirky ‘Gau Satyagrah’ , during which stray cattle were delivered to district and SDM offices to highlight the growing menace of stray cows—a problem the party claims it managed better during its previous tenure. By reclaiming the cow narrative from the BJP , Congress is making a statement that the cattle crisis has spiralled out of control under the current regime.Congress on Friday carried out a state-wide ‘ Gau Satyagrah ’- a protest against deaths of cows in road accidents and problems caused due to stray cattle-wherein Congress leaders took stray animals to all district offices, SDM offices, and other govt offices and left them there.The party workers were out on the streets in rain, wearing cow masks on their faces and raised slogans claiming cow smuggling has increased in the BJP regime across the state and the party was highly concerned for safety of cows.State Congress president Deepak Baij said, “We are carrying out a day-long protest across the state because cows are not safe in Chhattisgarh anymore, they are dying in accidents, killed, the cattle are on roads and govt has no solution to the problem. This protest is to wake the sleeping govt up and save cows. They have shut down the initiatives that Congress govt had taken for welfare of cows and farmer, which has caused the problem to rise.”Congress leaders including former chief minister Bhupesh Baghel were seen walking with dozens of cows to be delivered at governmentt offices.Former Congress MLA Vikas Upadhyay said that BJP talks about cows only when they want votes but after coming to power, cow death, and smuggling increased while Congress had arranged ‘gauthans’ for cows and their food.“Smuggling of cows in Arang Baloda Bazar, Bhatapara, Palari, have been reported, hence, we are going to deliver cows off streets to the office of district collector,” Upadhyay said.Congress during its regime had initiated Godhan Nyay Yojana under which, cow shelters were opened in villages with facilities for their fodder and health, to prevent road accidents due to cattle, saving crops of farmers and maintaining cleanliness on roads. There were schemes to procure cow dung and urine that opened sources for revenue among rural people, Congress leaders said. But now the streets and roundabouts are full of cows and livestock, while there have been cases where dozens of cows were razed down by vehicles.Recently on August 13, about 22 dead cows were found dead at different places in Baloda Bazar district, on August 2, a truck hit cattle sitting on the highway in Korea district, killing five cows on the spot.In July, a truck hit more than 20 cattle in Tilda, Raipur district, killing 15 cows.Reacting to the allegations and protest, BJP state general secretary Sanjay Srivastava said that those who have been sheltering those involved in killing cows are pretending to save cows today.“On the name of Gauthan and Godhan nyay yojana, Congress had created a means of corruption under which crores of corruption was done during its regime. During Congress govt, they have done a scam of Rs 13000 crore on the name of concern towards cows and ‘roka-cheka’ campaign,” Srivastava said.He added that it’s an attempt to save its political face that the Congress is resorting to ‘saving gau-vansh’, because it was only in Congress regime in September 2023 when the carcass of cows was dumped on roads after the cows had consumed poisonous food after Rahul Gandhi’s visit.","Congress on Friday carried out a state-wide ‘ Gau Satyagrah ’- a protest against deaths of cows in road accidents and problems caused due to stray cattle.
