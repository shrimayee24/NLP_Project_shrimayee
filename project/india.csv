Outgoing Maharashtra CM Eknath Shinde on Wednesday said he would not be an obstacle to govt formation and would accept any decision taken by PM Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah as ""final"", thus potentially clearing the way for the return of BJP 's Devendra Fadnavis as the boss of Mantralaya in what would mark the capping stone on BJP's astounding performance under him.""I called PM Modi and Amit Shah on Tuesday and told them that your call as head of NDA and Mahayuti is final for us, just as it is final for BJP,"" Shinde said, adding, ""Our Shiv Sena will fully support BJP's decision to name the next Maharashtra CM. There is no speed-breaker from our side."" The remarks were seen as tantamount to giving the BJP brass a free hand in picking the leader of the Mahayuti coalition.Addressing a press conference in Thane, Shinde said, ""I spoke with Modiji and Amit bhai on Tuesday and conveyed to them to not consider me as an obstacle while deciding the next Maharashtra CM. They gave us the opportunity to lead the state and helped us while we were in office. They are the senior-most leaders in the NDA and Mahayuti and their decision will be considered final for us. I told them Shiv Sena will wholeheartedly support their decision even if they choose a BJP candidate or anyone else from the Mahayuti."" Eknath Shinde was flanked by some of his MLAs, including Pratap Sarnaik and Dada Bhuse during a press conference in Thane, where he said he had told PM Modi and Amit Shah to take a final call on next CM. ""I am saying this openly, I am not holding anything back. I told PM Modi not to bring it to his mind that there is any issue in forming govt because of me. The decision you take is final for BJP, as it is final for us,"" Shinde said.Although the caretaker CM did not categorically state that he was conceding the CM's post to BJP nor said that he was staking claim to the top post, there has scarcely been any doubt about BJP cashing in on its fantastic poll returns to restore Fadnavis to the office he held between 2014-2019 and had looked set to retain until coalition partner Uddhav Thackeray dramatically broke away from the BJP-Sena coalition to forge the MVA combine comprising Congress and NCP.Asked if he was disappointed that he would not get a second term, Shinde said, ""There is no such thing. You must remember BJP supported my tenure as CM."" Asked who the deputy CMs would be in the new cabinet, he said, ""There is a meeting in Delhi tomorrow with Amit bhai (Shah) and all related decisions will be taken there."" Shinde said the power-sharing formula would be concluded after a meeting between him, Fadnavis and NCP's Ajit Pawar in New Delhi on Thursday.Reacting to Shinde's announcement, Fadnavis said, ""We have always been together. There are no differences in the Mahayuti. Even before the elections, I had said all decisions will be taken together. Today, Eknath Shinde has cleared all doubts. Soon, we shall sit with our leaders and take a decision.""It was not clear whether Shinde would agree to be deputy CM under Fadnavis. BJP, on its part, is expected to urge him to join Fadnavis govt by citing the need to project unity.In case he declines, there were indications of Sena nominating one of its three senior functionaries - Dada Bhuse, Sabhuraj Desai or Sanjay Shirsat.",Outgoing Maharashtra CM Eknath Shinde on Wednesday said he would not be an obstacle to govt formation and would accept any decision taken by PM Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah.

SC said a complaint of breach of promise to marry, based on consent for sexual relationship was obtained, must be lodged by the deceived woman with promptitude and not after continuing the physical relationship for years.The affair between Khare, a married man, and Jadhav, a widow, started in 2008. Jadhav said they had intercourse after the man promised to marry her. Khare's wife had lodged extortion complaints against Jadhav. In March 2017, Jadhav lodged rape complaint against Khare.SC said, ""In a situation where a physical relationship is maintained for a prolonged period knowingly by the woman, it cannot be said with certainty the said physical relationship was purely because of the alleged promise made by Khare to marry her.""",The Supreme Court has said a woman in an extramarital relationship for years cannot level rape charges against the man claiming that he had sex with her on the false promise of marriage.

We don't want one issue to disrupt Parliament. We must hold this government accountable for its multiple failures,"" TMC Lok Sabha MP Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar told reporters on Wednesday. Mamata Banerjee 's party is working out its own space within the INDIA bloc, essentially to have its own say within the group, even while Congress is the largest party and hence gets to lead the opposition charge most often. Congress’ recent electoral defeats in Haryana and Maharashtra and TMC’s victory in the Bengal bypolls have pushed the regional party into taking its own line, rather than follow Congress, while remaining within the opposition bloc.Most of the INDIA bloc party leaders including Mamata Banerjee are expected to attend Jharkhand chief minister and JMM chief Hemant Soren’s swearing-in on Thursday, for a show of strength for the opposition bloc.Asserting that TMC is part of the INDIA bloc at the national level, but not electoral ally with any party, Dastidar said, ""We will take on BJP but our outlook on how to go about it can be strategically different… TMC does not have an electoral alliance with any party, but we win.""TMC wants to take up Bengal’s deprivation, unemployment, price rise and inflation, situation in Manipur and the northeast, fertilizer shortage and the Aparajita (women’s protection) Bill, that has been passed by the West Bengal assembly but is being withheld by the governor, in the House. The party plans to take the imbroglio on the Aparajita Bill to President Droupadi Murmu and hold a statewide campaign on November 30.Of the 18 notices for adjournment motions in RS, for suspension of listed business to hold discussions on urgent issues, nine were from Congress MPs on the Adani matter on Wednesday. Other parties gave notices on Manipur Sambhal violence, increasing crimes in Delhi (by Sanjay Singh, AAP). Sushmita Dev (TMC), Tiruchi Siva (DMK), Raghav Chadha (AAP) and Sandosh Kumar P (CPI) had given separate notices for discussion on violence in Manipur, while John Brittas (CPM), A A Rahim (CPM), Ram Gopal Yadav (SP) and Abdul Wahab (IUML) gave notices to discuss the recent violence in UP’s Sambhal. All opposition parties protested leading to adjournment for the day, when Rajya Sabha chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar rejected the 18 notices","TMC wants Parliament to run.

NEW DELHI: After protests by opposition members on the panel, the Joint Parliamentary Committee scrutinising the Waqf (Amendment) Bill passed a resolution seeking extension of time for presentation of its report till the last day of the budget session next year.JPC chairperson and BJP member Jagdambika Pal will move a motion in LS on Thursday as per the business listed for the day to seek approval of the House for the extension.The JPC decided to move the resolution after a slugfest at Wednesday's meeting of the committee where opposition members stormed out alleging that its proceedings had become a ""mockery"". They, however, returned to attend the meeting after an hour amid indications that the chairperson would seek an extension in its term.Though the deferment marked a win for the opposition, it may also have helped push the likely debate and passage on the controversial bill closer to voting for Delhi polls likely to be scheduled in Feb.The budget session will be held from Feb 1. Thanks to the postponement, the two Houses may get to debate the bill just days ahead of the polls in Delhi, where properties handed over to the Waqf Board are set to be a key poll issue.BJP has said that the Congress-led UPA amended the Waqf Act in 2013 as part of its appeasement politics. In his celebratory speech on Nov 23 after the Maharashtra win, PM Narendra Modi had claimed that before Congress rule ended in 2014, the party handed over several properties near Delhi to the Waqf Board.""In its hunger for power, the Congress family has destroyed the Constitution's secular values,"" Modi had said, adding that Congress formed laws to promote appeasement politics and the Waqf Board was an example of it.Earlier in the day, Gaurav Gogoi of Congress, A Raja of DMK, Sanjay Singh of AAP and Kalyan Banerjee of TMC protested the conduct of Pal, alleging that he was keen to wrap up its proceedings by the Nov 29 deadline without completing due process.On Monday, which was the first day of winter session of Parliament, opposition MPs in JPC had met LS Speaker Om Birla and submitted a memorandum seeking extension of the deadline for the committee to submit its report.The bill seeks to amend the Waqf Act, 1995, to ensure more accountability and transparency in the functioning of Waqf Boards and also has provisions for mandatory inclusion of women in these bodies.","The Joint Parliamentary Committee scrutinising the Waqf (Amendment) Bill passed a resolution seeking extension of time for presentation of its report.

'Will abide by BJP decision': Has Eknath Shinde set the stage for 'Maha' role reversal with Fadnavis?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-abide-by-bjp-decision-has-eknath-shinde-set-the-stage-for-maha-role-reversal-with-fadnavis/articleshow/115740969.cms,"NEW DELHI: Has the stage been set for reversal of roles between BJP 's Devendra Fadnavis and Shiv Sena's Eknath Shinde in Maharashtra? Well, caretaker chief minister Shinde on Wednesday dropped enough hints about a change of guard in Mahayuti even though he did not say that in as many words. Shinde on Wednesday addressed a press conference to announce that ""he is not an obstacle in formation of new government"" and he will ""abide by the decision of Prime Minister Modi and Amit Shah on the CM pick.""""You (PM Modi) are the head of our family. The way people of BJP accept your decision, we will also accept your decision in the same way. I made a phone call to PM Modi and HM Amit Shah yesterday and told them that there will be no problem in forming the government because of me,"" Shinde said.Shinde's remarks come amid strong posturing and a concerted campaign by his party Shiv Sena for continuity in Mahayuti's leadership citing the Bihar model of Nitish Kumar. Shiv Sena leaders have demanded second term for Shinde crediting his governance for the coalition's massive win in the assembly elections.Devendra Fadnavis, who is likely to return as chief minister of the state - assuming the BJP top brass has no surprises up its sleeve, is already in the national capital ahead of a crucial meet of the Mahayuti allies with Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday. When asked about the CM pick, Fadnavis said: ""The answer to this will be given soon. All senior members of the three parties of Mahayuti will together take decision on this. Shinde has cleared the apprehensions which some leaders had.""While Shinde asserted that he had no ambition for the chief minister's post, he did not miss to highlight his hard work and achievements of his short tenure.""My tenure was just 2.5 years, but I think the work done by my government is of 10 years. All the decisions taken by Mahayuti government were historic,"" Shinde said and added ""I worked tirelessly day and night as a common party worker for the development of Maharashtra. I did not take even a day's holiday.""The caretaker chief minister also spoke at length about his humble origins and claimed that for him the full form of CM was common man and not chief minister. ""I am a farmer's son and I come from a poor family. I have always remembered my humble origins so that I could work for every common man of the state. People who come from rich families can never understand the pain of the common man,"" Shinde said.He then went on to talk about the Ladaki Bahin Yojna, which many experts feel was a gamechanger, and said for him the tag of ""Ladka Bhai"" is more important than any other designation. Shinde also invoked Balasaheb Thackeray and thanked PM Modi and Amit Shah for making Balasaheb's dream of a Sainik CM in Maharashtra a reality.Shinde seems to have reconciled to the turn of events. The BJP has 132 MLAs in the 288-member Maharashtra assembly - this is just 12 short of the half way mark. What's more, Ajit Pawar 's NCP - the third ally of the Mahayuti, would perhaps be happier with BJP at the helm than Shinde Sena.Little wonder, Sena functionary Ramdas Kadam made a candid admission about Ajit Pawar factor when he said that because of NCP, Sena's bargaining power to claim the CM's post had reduced in the Mahayuti.In 2022, when Shinde did not expect the top post, the BJP surprised him. Now, when he feels that he has contributed to coalition's victory and deserves a second term, the numbers are not in his favour.Ajit Pawar has confirmed that the meeting of Mahayuti leaders tomorrow in the national capital is likely to endorse the continuation of the same model - chief minister with two deputies.""All three of us (Devendra Fadnavis, Eknath Shinde and Ajit Pawar) are coming to Delhi tomorrow. Further discussions will be held there. Discussions on the formation of the government with a CM and two deputy CMs will be held,"" Pawar said.",Devendra Fadnavis and Shiv Sena's Eknath Shinde are likely to return as chief minister of Maharashtra.

""PM was absolutely right. By attacking a nationalist, Rahul has confirmed that he is a hard-baked pseudo-secular and an appeaser.

He challenged Uddhav Thackeray to get Rahul to say ""two sentences"" in praise of Balasaheb Thackeray, a Hindutva hardliner and a source of inspiration for Shiv Sena, while predicting that the Congress leader would start mocking Savarkar as soon as the Maharashtra campaign was over.Rahul fired his latest salvo at Savarkar while addressing a Constitution Day event Congress had organised at Talkatora Stadium.Holding up a copy of the Constitution, Rahul asked whether it reflected Savarkar's views or his advocacy for violence - remarks which BJP leaders described as ""derogatory"" towards the freedom fighter.BJP's chief spokesperson Anil Baluni accused Rahul of diminishing the contributions of all but his own forefathers to India's freedom struggle. He labelled Rahul's approach as that of a ""seasonal politician"" whose ideology shifted with electoral tides.Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, revenue minister in Maharashtra's outgoing govt, also condemned Rahul's statement, asking how Congress's new political allies would react to these perceived insults to Savarkar's legacy.BJP's IT department head Amit Malviya said in a post on X, ""Rahul Gandhi is vile and predictable.

MUMBAI: With no decision in the Mahayuti yet on who will be CM, Eknath Shinde , accompanied by deputy CMs Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar , met governor CP Radhakrishnan and tendered his resignation and that of his cabinet.
