It is interesting to me that the BJP and PM Modi spread so much fear, and the pressure of agencies on small businesses, everything vanished within seconds. It took years for them to spread this fear and vanished within seconds,"" Rahul said.""In Parliament, I see the Prime Minister right up front and I can tell you that the idea of Mr Modi, 56-inch chest, direct connection with God, that's all gone now, it's all history now,"" he added.","Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has a packed schedule for his final day in the United States.

NEW DELHI: Taking up from where he had left off before the 2024 polls, Rahul Gandhi again attacked Modi govt while on a foreign tour, blaming it for unemployment, growing infl-uence of RSS and for the San-gh's allegedly regressive views on women.The remarks, part of a discussion at University of Texas, elicited a strong reaction from BJP which called the leader of opposition in Lok Sabha a ""black spot"" on Indian democracy ""who sullies the image of India on foreign soil"".Speaking to students in the US, Rahul, asked about the employment problem, said the US used to be the production hub till the 1960s after which jobs moved to Korea, Japan and China, and China today dominated global production. ""You go to India, you look at the phones, you look at the furniture, you look at the clothes... you will see 'Made in China', that's a fact,"" he said, adding that America, Europe and India had given up on the idea of production that creates jobs and had handed it to China. tnnRahul Gandhi said Bangladesh too had wiped India clean in textile production. Rahul warned that continued slide in production would create massive social problems and ""polarisation of our politics is because of this"".Giving his ideas about increasing the labour participation of women, Rahul said, ""Also, this is part of the ideological fight between BJP and us. BJP and RSS believe that women should be restricted to a particular role. They should stay at home, they should cook food, they should not talk too much, and we believe that women should be allowed to aspire to whatever they want to do.""BJP slammed Rahul for his comments on RSS and 'India vs China' on production, with agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan saying Rahul was the leader of opposition and accountable to the country, but ""he has been going abroad and spoiling the image of the country, which is a crime akin to treason"".""No patriot does this, but it seems that Rahul has become frustrated after Congress lost three times in a row and is venting his frustration in America by tarnishing the country's image,"" he added.BJP spokesman Gaurav Bhatia said Rahul could not ""utter a single word against China, he weakens India... he stands by China"". He linked it to a ""party-to-party MoU with China"" that Congress has signed.Asked about BJP's attack on Rahul, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge said, ""He (Rahul) has never insulted India and will never do so.

SC: How was RG Kar doc’s autopsy done without mandatory document?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-how-was-rg-kar-docs-autopsy-done-without-mandatory-document/articleshow/113205919.cms,"Just 27 mins of RG Kar CCTV data given to us, CBI tells SC

NEW DELHI: Suspecting a cover-up attempt after discovery of the body of the raped and murdered doctor at Kolkata's RG Kar Hospital and Medical College , Supreme Court Monday asked Bengal govt how a ""vital document"" referring the body for postmortem examination could be missing from the files and how a doctor could carry out the procedure without that document.This aspect, which had escaped the notice of CBI , Bengal govt and the court, was raised by a counsel who said Kolkata Police could not have sent the body for autopsy without filling mandatory details about the body and clothes to the doctor, who would proceed only after receiving this document.A bench of CJI D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra immediately acknowledged the cruciality of this document in the chain of events.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for CBI in SC in RG Kar rape-murder, said Kolkata Police had not handed over to the central agency the report of the cops detailing the state of the victim's body and clothes as found in the crime scene.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal and advocate Astha Sharma, for West Bengal, conceded that files of Kolkata Police brought by their officers did not contain this document. ""The chief judicial magistrate filled the form himself and gave it to the doctor,"" Sibal said.The CJI asked, ""How can a postmortem be carried out without this document?"" Justice Pardiwala said, ""The constable who takes the body for postmortem is bound to carry this document. It has been struck blank. You need to explain. If this document is found missing, then something is vitally wrong.""He said, ""This document is crucial (to investigation) and of vital importance as it would have recorded the clothes and garments worn by the victim at the time of crime with which the body was sent for postmortem. It is impossible for the doctor, who conducts postmortem, to accept the body without this document."" Sibal said the state will file an affidavit giving details on this.The counsel, who first drew the court's attention to this missing document, informed the bench that this paper was part of the CD that was handed over to the HC. The SG said the possibility of some documents being generated subsequently could not be ruled out.The CJI also asked whether CBI had been handed over the entire CCTV footage, starting from the time the victim entered the seminar hall for rest, and containing entry and exit of the accused from the crime scene and discovery of the body? The SG said, ""What is shared with CBI is four video clips of CCTV footage totalling just 27 minutes between 5.06pm to 10.45pm.""Senior advocate Geeta Luthra alleged vandals who went on a rampage inside RG Kar hospital disturbed the crime scene. Another counsel said the wash basin and tiles on the walls of the toilet next to the crime scene had been completely replaced, obliterating every possible evidence that could have been picked by forensic experts.Senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani said despite lapse of time, there was no clarity on how the crime happened and the site of the crime.The CJI-led bench said, ""There is some clarity about when the body was discovered and there is some clarity about movement around the room where the woman doctor was resting in the night."" Jethmalani said the person who discovered the body should have registered the FIR, but the delay started from there.The court raised questions about timing of registration of 'unnatural death report' and other documents relating to the crime and asked CBI to investigate these. ""But one thing is loud and clear, there has been at least a 14-hour delay in registration of FIR, which was done at 11.30pm after the body was cremated,"" the bench said.The SG drew the court's attention to the report of forensic science laboratory Kolkata on the incident and said, ""There is something serious. CBI has taken a decision to send the samples for fresh forensic examination by AIIMS and FSLs in other states. Who took the samples is important. In a rape-murder case, the first five hours of the crime scene.""After perusing CBI probe status report, the CJI-led bench said, ""CBI appears to have certain leads. We have understood the line of investigation but do not want to discuss it in open court. CBI should file a fresh status report by Sep 16 indicating progress achieved on those leads."" It posted further hearing on Sep 17.",Kolkata Police could not have sent the body for autopsy without filling mandatory details about the body and clothes to the doctor.

The couple argued that they should be allowed to appear before the ED office in Kolkata instead of the Delhi office, and the alleged offence was committed in Bengal. Rujira raised an additional ground that being a woman, she should be examined at the place of her residence per Section 160 of CrPC.""We do not find any substance in the challenge made by the appellants to the summons issued to them under Section 50 of PMLA. As contemplated in the sub-section (3) of Section 50, all persons summoned are bound to attend in person or through authorised agents as the officer may direct..."" SC said.The bench said there were inconsistencies between Section 50 PMLA and Section 160 CrPC and, therefore, CrPC would not apply to proceedings under PMLA. It said Section 50 was gender-neutral and SC could not carve out an exception in favour of women.Referring to the SC's 2022 ruling by which various provisions of PMLA were upheld, the court said statements recorded by authorities under Section 50 were not hit by Article 20(3) or Article 21 of the Constitution and were admissible as evidence. ""At the stage of issue of summons, the person cannot claim protection under Article 20(3) of the Constitution, the same being not 'testimonial compulsion',"" it said.",Supreme Court dismisses pleas to quash ED summonses in a case of alleged illegal mining in Eastern Coalfields Ltd.

New Delhi: Talks between Congress and AAP for a tie-up in Haryana collapsed on Monday, with Arvind Kejriwal's outfit declaring candidates for 20 seats, including 12 for which Congress has already announced its nominees.AAP's decision came after Congress cold shouldered its demand for at least 10 of the 90 seats. Congress never agreed to give more than 4-5 and there, too, insisted that AAP field candidates in urban seats identified by AICC.Although the two sides seemed reluctant to acknowledge the failure of negotiations, the outcome, as signified by AAP's declaration of 20 candidates, surprised few.The decision of the two parties to have a tie-up pulled against their public declarations that their alliance was limited to the Lok Sabha polls. Congress, seemingly hopeful of a comeback in Haryana after a decade in opposition, had even started playing the opposition in Delhi by demanding action in the excise scam.Congress's state unit, in particular, opposed the idea of a tie-up as it was dismissive of AAP's claim to be a ""force"" in Haryana and had conveyed its stance to the central leadership.Congress's state unit, in particular, opposed the idea of a tie-up as it was dismissive of AAP's claim to be a ""force"" in Haryana and had conveyed its stance to the central leadership, which was keen on an alliance for the sake of sending a message of larger opposition unity.The first signs of an impasse appeared late Sunday night when Congress released a list of nine candidates, adding to its earlier 32, in what was a nudge to AAP to make up its mind and accept Congress's terms.AAP's decision to return the compliment with its own list gave a clear sign of confrontation.Although the two sides' reluctance to announce the demise of talks appeared leaving the door ajar for a last-minute twist, the parties were already preparing to contest separately.AAP's Haryana unit chief Sushil Kumar Gupta said the party would fight on all 90 seats and another list of 20 candidates would be released soon. ""We waited a lot for Congress to respond to our proposal but there was no response. So, it is not our mistake, and we have to declare candidates before the last date of nomination on Sept 12,"" he said. On Sunday, AAP negotiator Raghav Chadha had said Congress and AAP were trying to forge an alliance by keeping aside their individual aspirations.AAP functionary Sanjay Singh said the party would fight the Haryana polls with full strength. Gupta, too, reiterated that AAP had been preparing for 90 seats from day one and was confident of going into the fight solo.Congress appeared unfazed by AAP going it alone, with senior functionaries arguing that the election in Haryana would be a bipolar contest between BJP and Congress, and there was little interest among voters for minor outfits.Congress and AAP fought the 2024 Lok Sabha polls together in Delhi, Haryana and Gujarat, but separately in Punjab.

Whoever is guilty should be booked,” he said.Bawankule admitted that the Audi belonged to his son, Sanket. What raised doubts on police investigation was not just the missing registration number of the Audi involved in the accident, but also names of the accused in the FIR. The registration plates of the car, currently in police custody, were dismantled and found concealed below the seat. CCTV footage from the site revealed that the Audi driver took off from the bar at Dharampeth and drove at breakneck speed for 2km, before crashing into a car and hitting several other vehicles in succession.Earlier, after the pileup at Ramdaspeth wrecked Press Club employee Jeetendra Sonkamble’s car, two other vehicles in lane were impacted by the collision. The local Sitabuldi police soon sent out a message across police stations. Subsequently, the car accelerated in top gear and rammed another car on the Mankapur flyover, few km away.The deafening noise of the crash drew the attention of Ganesha Mandal devotees, who along with the injured victims chased the car and intercepted it. The duo was thrashed, bundled into another vehicle and driven away to Timki, 6km from Mankapur.Cops from Tehsil police station reached Timki to rescue them and drove them to a hospital for a check-up.

SC: Person in custody can seek pre-arrest bail in any other case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/if-booked-in-another-case-arrested-person-can-seek-anticipatory-bail-sc/articleshow/113205137.cms,"NEW DELHI: Settling a vexed issue that evoked different rulings from HCs, the Supreme Court on Monday adjudged that a person, already arrested and in custody in connection with an offence, is entitled to seek anticipatory bail if he feared that the police may arrest him in another offence.A bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud , and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra said given the state of affairs on the ground, the police may book an accused , already in custody for an offence, in another case and arrest him immediately in that case if he is released on bail in the first case.""There is no express or implied restriction in the criminal procedure code or in any other statute that prohibits the Court of Session or the High Court from entertaining and deciding an anticipatory bail application in relation to an offence, while the applicant is in custody in relation to a different offence,"" the bench said. Writing the 74-page judgment, Justice Pardiwala said, ""When procedural law doesn't preclude the investigating agency from arresting a person in relation to a different offence while he is already under custody in some previous offence, the accused too cannot be precluded of his statutory right to apply for anticipatory bail only on the ground that he is in custody in relation to a different offence.""Once an accused, who is in custody, is granted anticipatory bail by the court in a subsequent offence, the police cannot seek his remand for interrogation in the second offence, the bench said.The High Courts of Rajasthan, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh (Allahabad) had taken a view that an anticipatory bail application would not be maintainable if the accused is already arrested and is in custody in connection with some other offence. However, Bombay and Orissa HCs had taken a contrary view. The pre-arrest bail provision was introduced in 1973 in the criminal procedure code.The bench said if an accused, already under custody for an offence, is granted pre-arrest bail in a different offence, then the police cannot take him in custody for production before the trial court in the second case.The SC said, ""Each arrest a person faces compounds his humiliation and ignominy... The initial arrest itself often brings a wave of social stigma and personal distress, as the individual struggles with the implications of their legal predicament. When a subsequent arrest occurs, it intensifies this emotional and social burden, amplifying the perception of their criminality and reinforcing negative judgments from society."" ""Subsequent arrest in relation to different offences, while the individual is in custody in a particular offence, further alienates the individual from their community and adversely affects their personal integrity. For this reason, it is incorrect to assume that subsequent arrests diminish the level of humiliation. On the contrary, each additional arrest exacerbates the person's shame making the cumulative impact of such legal entanglements increasingly devastating,"" it said.","A bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra said given the state of affairs on the ground, the police may book an accused in another case and arrest him immediately in that case if he is released on bail in the first case.

KOLKATA: Sanjay Roy remains the only accused person on paper in the past 30 days of probe into the rape and murder of the RG Kar Hospital doctor - initially by the Kolkata Police and then by the CBI The central investigating agency has, meanwhile, interrogated almost 100 witnesses and ran 12 polygraph tests .Roy was arrested by the Kolkata Police on Aug 10 - a day after the incident.While Roy has claimed he is being framed in the case, the CBI considers him the prime suspect.The 33-year-old suspect, who was first spotted in the CCTV grab at the hospital, was tracked after his Bluetooth earphone was found near the body of the victim on the third-floor seminar hall in the emergency building.Kolkata Police's investigation led the sleuths to believe that the woman was gagged and that there were multiple signs of injuries on her body. She was allegedly strangled and her thyroid cartilage broke because of it.Roy, who was seen entering the hospital at 4 am on Aug 9, was seen exiting the building after 40 minutes. His earphone was missing and the device later paired with his cellphone. Later, traces of blood and skin found under the victim's fingernails matched Roy's DNA.After CBI took over the probe, Kolkata Police handed over 53 items seized by them, including Roy's clothes and undergarments.The CBI primarily ran Roy through a series of investigations by psychology experts, who termed him a ""sexual pervert"" with ""animal-like instincts"". The agency, which has sent his DNA and forensic reports to AIIMS Delhi, is awaiting its final opinion on that.Meanwhile, Roy has claimed before the additional chief judicial magistrate that he is being framed. During the polygraph test, he was asked what his next act was after committing the murder.Roy interrupted at this point and claimed that he had not committed the murder and such a question does not arise. He said that he had entered the room and found the woman lying unconscious and covered in blood.Roy claimed that he did not even know her, although CCTV grabs from the night of Aug 8 have shown him staring at the woman.The CBI has also spoken to nearly 100 witnesses, including the hospital's security staff, doctors, nurses and the victim's friends. Witnesses, including former RG Kar Medical College and Hospital principal Sandip Ghosh and Roy's friend Anup Dutta - an ASI with Kolkata Police - were run through polygraph tests.CBI also spoke to the victim's friends and recorded the statements of her parents.
