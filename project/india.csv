Interpol Blue Notice Explained: How CBI Tracks Absconding Luthra Brothers In Goa Nightclub Fire Case

NEW DELHI: Advocate Vishnu Joshi, representing a victim’s family in the Goa nightclub fire case, on Wednesday said that one of the Luthra brothers requested a Dunlop mattress during police remand.Joshi explained that the court carefully considered the brothers’ health claims before granting custody. Speaking to reporters, he said, “Today, when the Goa Police presented them in court, one accused, during their arguments, claimed he had spinal issues and other health problems. He requested that they be provided with a Dunlop mattress during their police remand. The state strongly opposed this... Their pre-medical examination showed them to be perfectly fit. ”He added that the duo had attempted to evade legal proceedings since fleeing India.“Since these people (Luthra brothers) absconded and fled the country, they have been employing tactics to somehow escape. First, they filed an anticipatory bail application on vague grounds in the Rohini Court, even though that court had no jurisdiction... But that bail application was rejected. Since then, they have been trying wherever they get a chance to obtain some kind of relaxation,” Joshi said.Joshi explained that the court carefully considered the brothers’ health claims before ordering custody.“The brothers claimed to be suffering from back pain. The court considered all submissions and directed the police to first conduct a pre-medical examination and re-examination. No medical necessity was found, following which the court, exercising its full authority, granted five days of police remand,” he said.The Luthra brothers, owners of the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub in Arpora, were remanded to five-day police custody by the Mapusa Judicial Magistrate First Class (JMFC) court.They were brought back to Goa from Thailand following their deportation and produced before the court after undergoing multiple medical examinations.After landing at Manohar International Airport, Mopa, under police escort around 10.45 am, the duo was taken to a primary health centre in Siolim and then to the District Hospital in Mapusa. The court directed fresh medical examinations before ordering the five-day custody to allow investigators to question them regarding alleged safety lapses at the club.The blaze broke out on December 6 around 11.45 pm during a crowded event at the nightclub, when electric firecrackers allegedly struck the wooden ceiling. The incident claimed the lives of 25 people, including tourists and staff, while several others were injured.Police said the brothers fled India hours after the incident on December 7, leaving for Thailand while rescue operations were under way. Goa Police launched a nationwide and international manhunt, issued a lookout circular and sought an Interpol Blue Notice.Following their detention by Thai authorities for illegal stay and the suspension of their passports, the brothers were deported to India on emergency travel documents.They landed at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport on Tuesday and were arrested by Goa Police, who obtained a 48-hour transit remand from a Delhi court to facilitate their return to Goa.They have been booked under several provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, including culpable homicide not amounting to murder and negligence. Investigators have also arrested several others linked to the nightclub’s operations and are probing allegations that the venue was operating with expired licences and without mandatory safety clearances.","Advocate Vishnu Joshi, representing victim's family, says one of the Luthra brothers requested a Dunlop mattress during police remand.

‘Not Rummy, Solitaire’: Kokate Blames Staff, Denies Playing Rummy in Assembly

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra Cabinet minister Manikrao Kokate on Thursday submitted his resignation to deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar , a day after he was divested of all his ministerial portfolios.Kokate lost all his portfolio after a Nashik court issued warrants for his and his brother Vijay's arrest in a 1995 EWS housing quota cheating case.Kokate has been sentenced to two years of rigorous imprisonment for securing two flats in 1995 under the state's 10 per cent economically weaker sections (EWS) quota by understating their income.CM Devendra Fadanvis accepted Kokate's resignation and forwarded the same to governor Acharya Devvrat for further action.Earlier, Pawar said the ex-minister's resignation had been accepted in principle and was forwarded to CM Fadnavis for due consideration and acceptance.""In keeping with our party’s long-standing philosophy that the rule of law is supreme and above all individuals, the resignation has been accepted in principle. I have forwarded Shri Kokate’s resignation to the Hon’ble CM for due consideration and acceptance, in accordance with constitutional procedure,"" Ajit Pawar wrote on X.Meanwhile, Maharashtra governor Acharya Devvrat has allotted the Sports and Youth Affairs, Minority Affairs, and Waqf ministries, previously held by Manikrao Kokate, to Ajit Pawar.The governor approved the letter sent by Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis in this regard yesterday.Kokate, who is the MLA from Sinnar, is the second NCP politician after Dhananjay Munde to have faced action since the Mahayuti alliance formed government in November 2024. Munde had to step down in March after the CM called for his resignation over allegations linking his associate Valmik Karad to the murder of Massajog sarpanch Santosh Deshmukh.While Nashik commissioner of police Sandeep Karnik said they had received a non-bailable warrant against Kokate and his brother, Bombay high court has posted the hearing of the minister's application for relief on Friday. Kokate got admitted to Mumbai's Leelavati Hospital on Wednesday.Earlier, a section of NCP functionaries demanded that Kokate should resign, and even the opposition said merely divesting him of portfolios was not enough, and he should be disqualified with immediate effect.The court of additional chief judicial magistrate Rupali C Narwadiya in Nashik rejected Kokate's application citing medical grounds to seek four days to surrender and issued the arrest warrants.",Kokate lost all his portfolio after a Nashik court issued warrants for his and his brother Vijay's arrest in a 1995 EWS housing quota cheating case.

Krishna contended that the investigation contained serious loopholes that resulted in a clean chit to Siddaramaiah, Parvati, her brother Mallikarjuna Swamy, and the original landowner, Devaraju.In his complaint to the court last year, Krishna accused Siddaramaiah and his family of profiting by Rs 56 crore. In 2021, Siddaramaiah's wife received 14 housing sites from Muda in exchange for 3.16 acres of land acquired by Muda. The land was gifted to Parvati by her brother in 2010.After the special court directed a probe, Siddaramaiah's family returned the sites to Muda. Krishna told TOI, ""The special judge, Santosh Gajanana Bhat, has directed the Lokayukta police to submit their report by Dec 23.

Shockingly, even the child’s name was disclosed in the report in violation of legal protections.No executive magistrate was involved in the inquest as required under law, and the SIT’s progress remained ‘at the same page’ even in a second status report filed on Nov 24, the HC observed.","J&K and Ladakh high court handed over to CBI the investigation into the death of a 13-year-old girl found hanging from a tree.

Hijab row: Pakistan-based gangster threatens Bihar CM Nitish Kumar; FIR registered,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/hijab-row-pakistan-based-gangster-threatens-nitish/articleshow/126063843.cms,"Nitish Kumar's Hijab Shocker: BJP MP Giriraj Singh Defends Bihar CM's Act With 'Go To Hell' Remark

PATNA: A video purportedly uploaded by a Pakistan-based man, threatening Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar over the hijab row has sent Patna police into a tizzy with cops registering a case with the cyber police station and asking Meta to block the account used to upload the video.Inspector general of police (Patna) Jitendra Rana said an email was sent to Meta to block the account and an FIR registered against the profile at the Cyber police station in Patna.“Details have been sought from Meta about the profile, which shared the video content on Instagram. Further investigation is underway to identify the uploader and people who shared it,” Rana told TOI.The Instagram user identified himself as “Shahzad Bhatti”, a Pakistan-based gangster, who released the video warning the Bihar CM of dire consequences.“Everyone must have seen what happened in Bihar…. That person still has time to apologise to that girl… Don't say later that a warning was not given,” Bhatti said in the video.Bihar DGP Vinay Kumar said authorities immediately swung into action and the case was handed over to Patna IG for a thorough probe.Patna Cyber DSP Nitish Chandra Dharia said they have identified the Instagram ID and are investigating the threatening video message.“Further action will be taken based on our investigation,” he said.A row erupted on December 15 when the CM was distributing appointment letters to newly recruited AYUSH doctors. A video emerged, showing the CM handing a letter to Dr Nusrat Parveen, and later lowering a veil covering her face for everyone to see the achiever’s face in a gesture seen by the ruling NDA coalition as “affection shown by a father towards a daughter”.However, the incident drew criticism from opposition parties like RJD and Congress and activists elsewhere in the country.The NDA stood by Nitish, with firebrand BJP minister Giriraj Singh saying that India is not an Islamic country, and showing one's face is not objectionable. “Doesn’t one show one’s face at the passport office and at the airport?” asked the Union minister.JD(U) state president Umesh Singh Kushwaha narrated how a number of welfare schemes launched by the Nitish Kumar govt for the social, economic and educational benefit of the minority class people have proved to be milestones. ""Prior to 2005, the minority class was feeling neglected, but the Nitish Kumar govt has brought it into the social mainstream,” Kushwaha said.HAM(S) patron and Union minister Jitan Ram Manjhi said Nitish pulled the veil not with bad intention but with fatherly affection. “His intention was not bad, otherwise I, too, would have protested,” Manjhi said.","A video purportedly uploaded by a Pakistan-based man, threatening Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar over the hijab row has sent Patna police into a tizzy.

Otherwise used to a life of luxury, the brothers spent their first night sleeping on the floor without any mat or blankets. They will continue to be in the police lock-up till Monday.Goa police have started interrogating both brothers in the case. The Luthra brothers were asked over 80 questions in connection with their associates’ roles, decision-making processes, financial aspects, event permissions, and the involvement of other partners, managers, and organisers.On Thursday morning, Saurabh was taken for a medical examination at North Goa District Hospital at Mapusa for a routine test. After doctors at the hospital declared him “fit for lock-up”, he was lodged again in the police lock-up.A senior police officer said that no special treatment was provided to the Luthra brothers, except one person was deployed to provide them with medicine on time as per the court’s direction.Police said that the Luthras have been kept in a separate lock-up and not with the other accused arrested in the case.The Luthras, through their lawyer P V Pavithran, asked the court to grant them a mattress in police custody as Saurabh “suffered from a problem related to the spinal disc” and Gaurav “suffered from a tailbone fracture problem”. Assistant public prosecutor Tejas Pawar opposed this demand, stating, “If they have medical issues, what made them book a ticket and fly to Thailand?”Judicial magistrate first class Puja Sardesai directed police to take the Luthras to a govt hospital for a medical examination. After this was completed, they were produced before the court. The judge consequently rejected the Luthras’ demand, noting that doctors at North Goa District Hospital declared them fit. She reviewed the medical report and said that the examination ruled out the need for special treatment and granted them police custody.Goa police have arrested Gurgaon resident Ajay Gupta, 55, a partner of the Luthra brothers, New Delhi natives Rajiv Modak, 49, chief general manager, and Priyanshu Thakur, 32, gate manager, along with UP natives Rajveer Singhania, 32, bar manager, Vivek Singh, 27, general manager, and Bharat Kohli from Delhi.Except for Gupta, the rest of the accused have been remanded in judicial custody on Thursday.
