Hockey dribbles through poll rhetoric in Sundargarh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hockey-dribbles-through-poll-rhetoric-in-sundargarh/articleshow/110131379.cms,"It’s peak time but Sundargarh in western Odisha seems unaffected by the intense political atmosphere gripping the state. Unlike politicians trying to checkmate each other with their election campaign rhetoric, teenagers in this tribal district are busy dribbling the ball past their opponents using crude, handcrafted hockey sticks to make a mark in the sport.“We have to play for some time before the sun becomes harsher,” says Johan Tirkey, an 18-year-old school dropout of Sadhumunda village in Kutra block.As the region prepares to vote on May 20, candidates are leveraging the sport’s popularity to connect with the electorate, often prioritising it over other pressing matters such as rising prices, healthcare access, educational opportunities, and job creation.Known as the nursery of Indian hockey, Sundargarh has produced numerous talented players who have represented the nation in both men’s and women’s teams.BJD’s key poll strategist and star campaigner V K Pandian, while canvassing in Sundargarh, spoke about Naveen Patnaik’s commitment to hockey, besides tribal arts, culture and traditions. BJD has been showcasing the holding of two consecutive men’s hockey World Cups — in Bhubaneswar (2018) and Bhubaneswar and Rourkela (2023) — as success stories. The Birsa Munda Stadium in Rourkela, which is part of Sundargarh Lok Sabha constituency, is being projected as among the world’s best.The political scene has been charged up due to the candidacy of Dilip Tirkey, Hockey India president and former Indian captain. He is running for Lok Sabha as a BJD nominee. BJP has strategically aligned its campaign with Prabodh Tirkey, another former Indian hockey captain who is supporting Jual Oram, a former Union minister and candidate of the saffron party. Prabodh’s involvement in BJP’s campaign comes after his bitter departure from Congress. He was selected as a Congress candidate for Talsara Vidhan Sabha, but was dropped later. Feeling slighted, Prabodh joined BJP.Candidates vying for votes in this hockey heartland focus their promises on improving facilities and opportunities for the sport, recognising its importance to the community. Jual, a five-time MP from Sundargarh, says hockey infrastructure in the region got a massive boost because of District Mineral Foundation (DMF) funds, thanks to the Modi govt’s initiative of amending the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act in 2015. It ensured massive fund inflow into minesbearing districts to spend for welfare in catchment areas. Sundargarh district has got more than Rs 6,400 crore DMF funds. DMF money helped build a world-class hockey stadium at Rourkela and astro-turfs across the district in the last five years, he said, adding, “people deeply appreciate the same and have faith that the infrastructure will improve further in Modi’s third term as PM”.Sundargarh’s passion for hockey is evi dent in the way the sport shapes the region’s identity and aspirations. Dilip says people of Sundargarh have been expressing their joy and satisfaction with the world-class hockey facilities provided by the Naveen Patnaik-led BJD govt. “As a candidate, wherever I am going to campaign in the constituency, I can see sports lovers’ happiness because of the world-class facilities,” he adds.He further says, “Naveen babu has done a lot for the development of hockey in Sundargarh, which includes 16 hockey training centres and the world-class stadium at Rourkela. The chief minister gave Sundargarh its cherished identity by organising the World Cup Hockey.”Dilip had lost to Jual in 2014 and had not contested in 2019 when BJD had fielded Sunita Biswal, daughter of former Congress CM Hemananda Biswal.Prabodh, who has been campaigning for BJP, says though hockey training centres have come up, many former players from Sundargarh district, including Olympians, were not hired as coaches. Instead, coaches from outside Odisha have been employed, which is disheartening for the district’s wellknown former players and sends out a wrong message. “People are not happy with the BJD govt because the work for hockey does not involve the entire community of hockey lovers and players,” he adds.Some people scrutinise govt work on other aspects, too. Francis Tirkey, a 50-year-old man of Saunamara village in Balisankara block, which happens to be the native place of Dilip, besides another Indian hockey player Amit Rohidas, says, “We are facing difficulty in getting water for cultivation, which is very much essential. Though initiatives on hockey are good for the future of children, the state govt should also pay attention to other issues,” he adds.The contest in Sundargarh, having 15.8 lakh voters, this time is largely between Jual and Dilip though eight candidates are in the fray. Congress has fielded former MLA Janardan Dehury. The constituency reserved for tribals has 8 lakh tribal voters, 2.9 lakh Christians and 75,000 Muslim voters.","Known as the nursery of Indian hockey, Sundargarh has produced numerous talented players who have represented the nation in both men's and women's teams.

People have praised my cooking. But will Modi ji accept my food? Will he trust me? I will cook whatever he loves.""The TMC supremo had said, ""I love both vegetarian foods like Dhokla and non-veg foods like macher jhol (fish curry).

It will serve three purposes, secularism will be asserted, it will show charity begins at home and the fritters will also be praised.""Meanwhile, BJP leader Sankudeb Panda claimed Banerjee had deliberately invited Modi knowing well that he is a strict vegetarian.""This is nothing but her ploy to trap the PM. She knows on the one hand the PM will never eat fish or any non-veg item.

"After finding faith, Tamil Sikh tests Punjab poll waters",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/after-finding-faith-tamil-sikh-tests-punjab-poll-waters/articleshow/110127356.cms,"Periyar, Kanshi Ram icons of our party: Tamil Sikh in poll fray from Hoshiarpur

CHENNAI/JALANDHAR: In his yellow turban and long grey beard, Jeevan Singh Malla looks the part.He's just had a series of small, informal meetings with community leaders in Punjab 's Hoshiarpur, seeking their support for his electoral debut as a candidate for the Lok Sabha seat. ""I have the backing of Dalit activists, too,"" Malla says, clasping his hands.It's only when the words roll out of his mouth with a curious accent that you realise he may be the odd one out in the roster of Sikh candidates for Punjab's 13 Lok Sabha seats.Malla is a Tamil-origin Sikh who heads Bahujan Dravida Party, which owes its origins as much to his choice of faith as to the cause of fighting caste discrimination .The purpose of my contesting a seat in Punjab goes beyond immediate poll results. The messaging is both political & cultural. Egalitarianism was Guru Nanak’s fundamental principle, and we also want to spread that,” he says.Malla loosely translates his party’s motto, Begumpura Khalsa Raj, as “Nanak’s freedom raj without sorrow”.The 51-year-old, who was always fascinated by tenets of Sikhism, was at Singhuborder along with a few others from his native state in 2021 to show solidarity with the protesting farmers.What was meant to be a march against farm laws turned out to be an exploration of what he calls Sikh fortitude. He saw in farmers’ steadfastness an extraordinary sense of purpose strengthened by their faith. He knew he must belong.Three years later, Jeevan Kumar is officially Jeevan Singh Malla. He now recites the Gurbani. He has converted his house at Korampallam into “School of Miri Piri” (School of Politics and Culture), where Tamil Sikhs occasionally meet for discourse and prayers. His BDP has fielded Tamil Sikhs in seven LS seats in Tamil Nadu and 40 others in seats across other states. The law graduate had first visited a gurdwara in Punjab in 2019 to become a Sikh, only to be told to return in six months. “I was asked to grow a beard,” he recounts with amusement. Today, Tamil Nadu has about 25 practicing Tamil Sikhs and many others who are learning about the faith. On why he chose Hoshiarpur, Malla says, “Bahujan Samaj Party founder Kanshi Ram contested the seat and became an MP from there in 1996. He remains a source of motivation for us. Periyar and Kanshi Ram are icons of our party.”BDP’s state president, Tirath Singh, who joined Kanshi Ram’s movement in 1981 and was closely associated with BSP until 2003, has been Malla’s constant companion on his political journey through Punjab. Tamil Sikhs pray at gurdwaras in Chennai and Rameswaram. Malla’s organisation, Tamil Sikhs Brotherhood and Education Foundation, plans to build a gurdwara in Thoothukudi, formerly Tuticorin. “Before that, we want to spread the message of the Gurus on eradicating caste from society,” says the lawyer. Discrimination in Tamil Nadu’s caste cauldron is one of the reasons for many being drawn to Sikhism. SCs like Pallar and Vannar bear the brunt of caste bias, sometimes facing harsh treatment from even their own. “Being a Sikh, I am not identified by caste anymore,” says Malla.",Malla is a Tamil-origin Sikh who heads Bahujan Dravida Party.

Godhra

, my image was deliberately tarnished: PM Modi

VARANASI: Saying he had resolved not to get drawn into ""Hindu-Mussalman"" politics, PM Modi declared Tuesday after filing his nomination for UP's Varanasi Lok Sabha seat that the day he resorted to such methods, ""us din main sarvyajanik jeevan me rehne yogya nahin rahunga (I won't be fit for public life)"". The statement was part of PM's clarification in an interview with Network 18 that he never meant Muslims while talking about ""infiltrators"" and ""those with more children"" in his campaign speeches.""I am shocked. Who told you that whenever one talks of people with more children, the inference is they are Muslims? Why are you so unjust towards Muslims?"" Modi said. ""Main 'Hindu-Mussalman' nahin karunga; yeh mera sankalp hai (I won't play 'Hindu-Muslim' card; that's my vow).""The PM said having more children than families can afford to feed, clothe and educate was a common problem among the country's poor, irrespective of faith.He peppered the interview with instances of how living among Muslim families in his neighbourhood gave him insights into their customs and practices. “Eid would be celebrated in our house, too, just as other festivals were. There would be no cooking that day as food would come from our Muslim neighbours. On Muharram, if we had to go out, I knew that we would have to pass under the tajiya. I grew up in that society. I have so many friends who are Muslims... Just that I don’t like to advertise this aspect.”Asked whether he would acknowledge being unable to break the perception that “Modi doesn't belong to Muslims”, the PM said, “This issue is not about Muslims. “Irrespective of how supportive individual Muslims are of Modi, there is a wave of thought that dictates to them, ‘do this, do that’. After 2002, after Godhra, my image was deliberately tarnished.”PM Modi said, “Irrespective of how supportive individual Muslims are of Modi, there is a wave of thought that dictates to them, ‘do this, do that’. After 2002, after Godhra, my image was deliberately tarnished.”On whether he was sure Muslims would still vote for him, Modi said, “The people of the country will vote for me.”Earlier in the day, flanked by a VIP congregation that included Union ministers, CMs of three NDA-governed states, ex-CMs and allies, the PM filed his nomination for a third consecutive term as MP from Varanasi at the auspicious ‘Pushya Nakshatra’ muhurat decided by Kashi scholars. The 26-strong group assembled at the collectorate included home minister Amit Shah, defence minister Rajnath Singh, housing and urban affairs minister Hardeep Singh Puri, UP CM Yogi Adityanath and BJP chief JP Nadda.The alliance partners from UP included Apna Dal (Sonelal) president Anupriya Patel, SBSP chief Om Prakash Rajbhar, Nishad Party chief Sanjay Nishad, and RLD president Jayant Chaudhary. Maharashtra CM Eknath Shinde, Union minister Ramdas Athawale, and NCP’s Praful Patel were also present.From Bihar, LJP’s Chirag Paswan and Pashupati Paswan, ex-CM Jitan Ram Manjhi and Rashtriya Lok Morcha chief Upendra Kushwaha landed in Varanasi to be by the PM’s side. Meghalaya CM Conrad Sangma, Assam minister Atul Bora, and Pramod Boro of the Bodoland Territorial Council were there, too, along with former Andhra Pradesh CM Chandrababu Naidu, Jan Sena chief and actor Pawan Kalyan. GK Vasan and Anbumani Ramadoss from Tamil Nadu, and Thushar Vellappally from Kerala completed the line-up. Modi wrote a series of posts on his official X handle later, describing his bond with the millennia-old city of Kashi. “My relationship with my Kashi is amazing, integral and unmatched… It cannot be expressed in words,” he said. “Filed my nomination papers as a candidate for the Varanasi LS seat. It is an honour to serve the people of this historical seat. With the blessings of the people, there have been remarkable achievements over the last decade. This pace of work will get even faster in the times to come.”Before filing his papers, the PM visited Dashaswamedh Ghat for Ganga aarti on the occasion of Ganga Saptami and boarded the MV Vivekanand Ro-Ro to reach Namo Ghat. He also visited the Kaal Bhairav temple by road.","PM said he never meant Muslims while talking about ""infiltrators"" and ""those with more children"" in his campaign speeches.

Lok Sabha polls: Nearly a quarter of BJP candidates are defectors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lok-sabha-polls-nearly-a-quarter-of-bjp-candidates-are-defectors/articleshow/110128252.cms,"Leaders who have changed allegiances being given a ticket to contest the elections is nothing new in Indian politics , but the scale at which this has happened with BJP’s list for Lok Sabha polls is unusual. Almost a quarter of the list, or 106 of the 435, consists of those who have switched to the saffron party at some point in the last 10 years. Of them, 90 joined BJP in the last five years.The highest proportion of such candidates is in Andhra Pradesh, where BJP has put up six candidates. All but one of them has come from another party between 2019 and now. That includes switches not only from Congress and YSRCP, but ironically even from its current ally, TDP.In neighbouring Telangana, nearly two-thirds of the BJP’s 17 candidates are imports from other parties, mainly BRS but also Congress. Six of the 11 such candidates have joined BJP in the run-up to these elections.While Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are states where BJP has had at best a limited presence in the past, even in Haryana, where it has been helping the state govt for a decade, six of its 10 candidates are those who have switched sides from 2014 onwards. Two of them — Naveen Jindal and Ashok Tanwar — joined in the run-up to Lok Sabha polls.Next door, in Punjab over half the party’s 13 candidates have been drawn from those who were in other parties till not too long back. Some of them were in Congress but quit along with Amarinder Singh and became part of BJP when he merged his fledgling outfit with the saffron party.Jharkhand is similar to Punjab with seven of the 13 having been members of other parties till a decade or less back. In this case, the imports are from JMM, Congress and the erstwhile Jharkhand Vikas Morcha, the most high-profile of them being Sita Soren, sister-in-law of the state’s former chief minister, Hemant Soren.Perhaps the most surprising among the states with a high proportion of candidates who have sitched sides is Uttar Pradesh, where BJP has been dominant in elections over the last decade, be it parliamentary polls or state assembly. Of the 74 BJP candidates here (not including one ally contesting on the party’s symbol), 23 have joined BJP sometime between 2014 and now. That’s 31% of the party’s candidates in the state.A high proportion of such candidates in Odisha (29%) and Tamil Nadu (26%) is not very surprising, given that these are not traditional strongholds of BJP. A quarter of the candidates in Maharashtra being those who’ve switched sides is arguably symptomatic of the considerable churn that the state’s politics has witnessed, particularly over the last five years.West Bengal has a similar proportion of such candidates as Maharashtra, but all other states have lower proportions. Yet, even the ultimate BJP stronghold, Gujarat, has two candidates who have moved to the party since 2014.This analysis excludes allies contesting on BJP tickets. It does include five cases of what might be termed “gharwapsi” — BJP members who had moved to other parties but have since come homing back to where they started from. The five include Jagdish Shettar in Karnataka, Udayanraje Bhonsale in Maharashtra and Sakshi Maharaj in Uttar Pradesh.","Almost a quarter of the list consists of those who have switched to the saffron party at some point in the last 10 years.

Will make AAP accused in excise case: ED to Delhi HC; party dubs probe 'fake',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/will-make-aap-accused-in-excise-case-ed-to-hc-party-dubs-probe-fake/articleshow/110127761.cms,"ED functioning like political wing of BJP, says AAP

NEW DELHI: ED on Tuesday told Delhi HC that AAP would be made a co-accused in the next prosecution complaint that the agency would file in Delhi excise policy case . ED's disclosure came while opposing the bail plea of Delhi's ex-deputy CM Manish Sisodia in a money laundering case related to the larger matter.AAP said, ""The intention behind the fake probe is to frame AAP, arrest its top leaders and crush the party."" The case was built on statements of accused-turned-approvers, all of whom had links to BJP , it said.Last year, Supreme Court had touched upon the issue of making AAP an accused in the case and asked ED why the political party was not named if the porbe agency's claim is to be believed that it benefited from the alleged kickbacks in the liquor policy case. ""A political party is said to be the beneficiary of this, but it is neither an accused nor impleaded in the case. How do you answer that?"" SC had then remarked, but clarified a day later that its query was ""not to implicate any political party"" but ""just a legal question"" aimed at the agency.AAP national chief and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal has already argued in his petition pending before the HC that a political party is not covered under the anti-money laundering law. However HC, while upholding Kejriwal's arrest in the case, had noted that Section 70 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), which deals with companies, is attracted in the case, after ED reiterated that AAP is similar to a company and Kejriwal its director, while fixing liability for the alleged scam.During the hearing on Tuesday, ED claimed that there were concerted efforts by accused persons to delay the process of framing of charges in the case even as CBI also opposed Sisodia's bail plea in the corruption case and blamed him for the delay. It expressed apprehension that Sisodia might tamper with evidence if released.However, Sisodia's legal team highlighted that he is entitled to bail and pointed out that the ED and the CBI are still arresting people in the money laundering and corruption case, so there is no question of early conclusion of the trial.Senior advocate Mohit Mathur, representing Sisodia, said the trial court judge, while dismissing the bail plea, has not shown how the AAP leader has contributed to the delay. ""I had filed an application to physically meet my wife. Thereafter, I moved an application to sign a cheque. How does it delay the trial? How have I contributed to the delay in the proceedings? The trial court has said that out of 38 applications, 13 were filed by Sisodia. But the court has not said how my application contributed to the delay,"" he countered the ED's allegation. The former CM also sought parity on the ground that other accused in the case have got bail. ""Post dismissal of my earlier bail, three accused have gotten some relief from the Supreme Court. Benoy Babu in ED case. Sanjay Singh, again in ED case and Arvind Kejriwal most recently. There is no threat as far as my running away is concerned. I (Sisodia) have been in custody for 14.5 months,"" he argued.Reacting to the ED's submission in court that it was going to make AAP an accused in the excise policy case, the party in a statement said the probe agency was functioning like a political wing of the BJP.Justice Swarana Kanta Sharma after hearing the arguments reserved it for orders. AAP claimed that even after two years of investigation and over 500 raids, not a single rupee or a piece of evidence had so far been recovered from any of the AAP functionaries. ""If at all there is any money trail recovered so far in the alleged Delhi liquor scam, it is the Rs 60 Crore that the kingpin of the scam, Sharath Reddy, has given to BJP (through electoral bonds). Had ED been doing an impartial investigation, it would have immediately arrested BJP President JP Nadda and made the party the prime accused in the scam. But unfortunately, it is acting as a political wing and a mouthpiece of the BJP,"" AAP said.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said that it was AAP's standard practice to accuse the investigating agencies of being political in case of any adverse development against them. ""Instead of giving media reactions, AAP should fight the allegations in the courtroom where their leaders' pleas fail repeatedly,"" Kapoor said.",ED says AAP will be co-accused in next prosecution complaint in Delhi excise policy case.

"'Marathi voter only with Sena is myth, people have repeatedly voted for us'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/marathi-voter-only-with-sena-is-myth-people-have-repeatedly-voted-for-us/articleshow/110126935.cms,"The Marathi and Muslim vote could be the gamechangers in the six Mumbai seats. Maharashtra deputy CM

Devendra Fadnavis

tells

TOI’s Clara Lewis

that Sena is trying to fill the deficit in Marathi votes with Muslim votes. Excerpts from the interview:

After Ajit Pawar

NCP

joined the BJP-led alliance there was anger among

supporters.

If you say justice for all, appeasement of none, then would BJP consider abolishing caste-based quota?

Are you disappointed that despite being given benefits the Muslims are voting en masse one way.

On seat-sharing, there is discontent amongst BJP workers especially in Thane.

It is perceived that there is sympathy for Uddhav and Sharad Pawar.

The

Marathi voter

is seen as being with Uddhav Thackeray. It will be a close contest on five seats in Mumbai.

The Muslim voter seems to favour the Shiv Sena

How do you view polarisation of Maratha and OBC votes?

You made allegations against certain people and now they are candidates.

What will be the post-election scenario?

What happens to you?

The Shiv Sena-BJP alliance is an emotional alliance while the alliance with NCP is a political one.If you consider the original NCP of Sharad Pawar, it has no ideology as such, it is a party of a regional satrap. We have no issue with their ideology, we have a problem with appeasement. Where it is being said the right on resources is of the Muslim we say that the first right is of the poor irrespective of caste and religion.Initially our voter was angry (with the NCP alliance) but eventually Ajit Pawar's conduct has ensured there is no contempt now. You will see this in the Baramati result from how the Khadakvasla voter, who is essentially a BJP voter, votes.It (abolition of caste for reservation) is not on any agenda. If caste is to be abolished, society will do it eventually. When reservation was first debated there was a proposal that we should give religion-based reservation, but unanimously the Constituent Assembly said the basis of reservation is social backwardness, economic, educational backwardness. So far as other religions were concerned it was debated that these religions claim that there is no caste, and there is no social discrimination if there is no caste system. So, it was unanimously resolved that there can be no reservation based on religion.There is some disappointment but in a way this is the last attempt of Congress and similar parties. If this fails, then Muslims will have no confidence in them. Till date by instilling fear in minorities they (Congress) have taken their votes. Attempts have been made to tell Dalits that the Constitution will be changed but Modi's credibility is very high.It is natural that any party would want more seats. We were hoping for 30 seats but got 28. We were insisting on Thane. But the CM said even if this seat is yours we have held it for seven elections. If I let go of Anand Dighe's seat it would demoralise my workers. He urged that we not insist on it.There may be sympathy among their cadre, but overall I see no sympathy. Pawar broke parties and homes. Their parties split because they wanted to pass on their legacy to their children. By making someone else a villain, no one becomes a hero. Ajit Pawar was made a villain as Pawar wanted to pass on his legacy to Supriya. Similarly, Eknath Shinde found the ground beneath his feet shifting as Aditya was being projected and Shinde's wings being clipped though he did all the organisational work.That the Marathi voter is only with the Shiv Sena is a myth. In the 2017 civic elections we won 82 wards against their 84. In 2014, we fought assembly polls separately and BJP got more seats than the Sena. In 2019 we fought as an alliance and Sena fought one seat more than us but got five seats less. I am also Marathi and so is Ashish Shelar. People have repeatedly voted for us. Modi's popularity is beyond caste and language.There is more appeasement being done by Sena than Congress. One can see more Muslims in Shiv Sena offices. At Thackeray rallies, Allah-ho-Akbar slogans are being given by those wearing Shiv Sena scarves. I think they are trying to fill the deficit in Marathi votes with Muslim votes.In a state like Maharashtra, it will disturb the social fabric. This has happened in 4-5 constituencies.It is the Shiv Sena which decided to give them candidature. As an alliance we will campaign for the candidate.

The polling percentage, which breached the 40 per cent mark by 1 pm on Monday, crossed 68 per cent by 5 pm. The final turnout could be anywhere between 75 to 85 per cent. After a brief lull between 1 pm and 3 pm, the booths witnessed an unprecedented rush in the evening.The intense contest between the YSRCP and NDA alliance parties (BJP-TDP-Jana Sena) drew hundreds of thousands of migrants and employees who work outside Andhra Pradesh back to the state. Coastal districts in Andhra Pradesh, which typically experience an influx of visitors during Sankranti, witnessed even higher numbers on Monday.This surge was attributed to political parties arranging travel facilities, in addition to those who voluntarily returned. MLA candidates have organized 10 to 15 buses from each constituency to cities like Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, and others.Many people usually skip coming to Sankranti due to the unavailability of tickets or unaffordable ticket prices, but the situation is different this time.
