Kolkata Police: ‘Legal procedures followed’

Suvendu Adhikari slams arrest as 'appeasement politics'

NEW DELHI: A 22-year-old Instagram influencer, Sharmishtha Panoli, on Saturday was remanded to 14-day judicial custody after she was arrested by Kolkata Police for allegedly making communal remarks in a social media video. The law student, originally from Kolkata’s Anandapur area and currently enrolled at a Pune-based university, was apprehended in Gurugram on Friday night after reportedly evading multiple police summons.The video in question featured Panoli criticising Bollywood actors for their silence on Operation Sindoor , as per police sources cited by news agency. The post went viral and triggered a wave of backlash, prompting her to delete the video and issue an apology. However, by then, a formal complaint had been filed in Kolkata and legal proceedings had commenced.Panoli was produced in a Kolkata court on Saturday, where her bail plea was rejected and she was remanded to judicial custody until June 13,reported. She has been charged under several sections related to promoting enmity between groups and causing religious disharmony.In response to online speculation about the legality of the arrest, Kolkata Police issued a statement clarifying that all due process was followed.“In reference to Garden Reach Police Station Case No. 136 dated 15.05.2025, certain social media narratives suggesting an unlawful arrest of a law student are factually incorrect and misleading,” the statement read. “All legal procedures were duly adhered to. Multiple attempts were made to serve notice, but she was absconding each time. A competent court then issued an arrest warrant, and she was apprehended lawfully from Gurugram. ”The statement added that she was produced before a magistrate and granted transit remand as per legal norms.Reacting to the arrest, BJP leader and West Bengal Leader of Opposition Suvendu Adhikari accused the state government of selective action.“FIRs were filed against Mahua Moitra for derogatory remarks about Goddess Kali. Was any action taken? Saayoni Ghosh made comments about Mahadev. Nothing happened,” Adhikari said. “This is appeasement politics. Action is only taken against Sanatanis while others have a licence to abuse Sanatana Dharma.”Adhikari claimed that several FIRs against TMC leaders had been ignored and accused the ruling party of using religion as a political tool to secure its vote bank.","Sharmishtha Panoli, 22, was arrested for allegedly making communal remarks in a social media video.

NEW DELHI: Jan Suraaj chief Prashant Kishore on Friday upped the ante against Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar after he mixed Prime Minister Narendra Modi's name with former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee while addressing a rally.Kishore accused Bharatiya Janata Party of ""imposing"" Nitish on the heads of youth by making him custodian of Bihar.""I have been telling people for the last three months that Nitish Kumar's psychological and physical condition is so bad that he cannot even name his fellow members of the Council of Ministers.

Realising the error, he quickly attempted to recover, and asked the crowd to stand and ""pranam"" PM Modi.The moment added to a growing list of incidents that have raised concerns over Kumar’s public conduct and his health. Opposition leaders, including Bihar CM's key challenger and RJD MLA Tejashwi Yadav, have questioned his health and suitability to continue governing the stateRecently, Nitish Kumar placed a potted plant on a senior IAS officer's head during a government function.With his trademark calm, Nitish accepted the plant, and gently placed it on the officer’s head, drawing stunned silence followed by bursts of laughter from the audience. Siddharth, visibly taken aback, stood still as the chief minister continued, unbothered.In another incident, Kumar was seen clapping abruptly during a solemn tribute on Mahatma Gandhi’s death anniversary, a clip that quickly went viral. Despite the misstep, Kumar praised the Modi government’s efforts for Bihar’s development.Speaking just ahead of PM Modi, he lauded the Centre’s support in the budget and welcomed the caste enumeration initiative to be carried out in the next population census.""The development work that is being done by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the development of Bihar... Whatever Bihar has received is a matter of pride. I salute the Centre for announcing the caste-based census. People from other parties were trying to create confusion,"" Kumar said.Bihar is heading toward assembly elections this November, with Nitish Kumar’s JD(U) aligned with the BJP as part of the ruling NDA coalition. The state has 243 assembly seats up for contest.","Jan Suraaj chief Prashant Kishore upped the ante against Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar.

She died in my arms: Poonch mourns lives lost in Pakistan shelling,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/she-died-in-my-arms-poonch-mourns-lives-lost-in-pak-shelling/articleshow/121541610.cms,"She died in my arms: Poonch mourns lives lost in Pak shelling

POONCH: Shells screamed through the early morning darkness of May 7, tearing through homes and lives in Poonch district, close to the LoC in J&K. At Sukha Kattha, a cluster of small homes on a mountainside, Javid Iqbal’s five-year-old daughter Mariyam lay in his lap, her stomach ripped open by shrapnel. “She died in my arms,” he said on May 30, showing her photo, voice choked. His eight-year-old daughter Iram Naaz was wounded too.In another part of the district, at Jamia Zia-ul-Uloom, a 52-year-old seminary that doubles as a boarding school, Qari Mohammad Iqbal had just started his day. A shell exploded near an under-construction building beside his room, sending metal splinters flying. Four students were wounded. Qari Iqbal, a 46-year-old Quran teacher, was declared dead on arrival at the district hospital.As bombs rained on Poonch for three days, 14 civilians lost their lives, including students, religious teachers, shopkeepers, homemakers, and former soldiers. Over 65 were wounded — many with life-altering scars.Panic spread faster than the blasts. Families fled, streets emptied, The district fell silent under fear.“Not even in 1965 did we witness this kind of bombardment,” said Zulfikhar Ali, a shopkeeper in Poonch town’s main market. “Everyone who could afford to leave, left.”From May 6 night to May 10, five shells landed outside BJP functionary Pradeep Sharma’s home. “It began at 1.45 am and didn’t stop for days,” Sharma said. “Doctors worked tirelessly, but if we had ventilators, we might have saved six to eight more. We need a trauma hospital here, a govt medical college.”Sharma said 80% of Poonch fled by May 10. He demanded bunkers for every household and government jobs, not just for families of the dead but also for those wounded in the shelling. “Thirty-five of them have lifelong wounds,” he said. “They’re living with trauma too.”Amid loss and grief, another wound cut deep — one of defamation. Hours after Qari Iqbal’s death, Delhi-based news channels flashed his photo on screen, calling him a Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorist killed in Operation Sindoor.At Jamia Zia-ul-Uloom on May 30, his brother Farooq Ahmad sat quietly, his face sunken. “We were already mourning, and then we got WhatsApp forwards. Friends asked, ‘Why are news channels calling your brother a terrorist?’ He had a beard and a Muslim name. That was enough for them to brand him something he wasn’t. Even in death, he was humiliated.”Authorities moved quickly. Poonch police and district officials called the reports “baseless and misleading”. Legal action was threatened against any outlet or person spreading false claims. Both CM Omar Abdullah and Congress MP Rahul Gandhi visited the Jamia and were briefed about the slander.Nazira Kousar, a mother from Poonch, rushed through falling shells to the hospital on May 7. Her 14-year-old son had been wounded at the seminary. “Nothing could stop me,” she said. “He survived, but now hides under a blanket, afraid to go outside. My husband has liver disease. We can’t afford treatment.” She came back on May 30, hoping someone would listen.On May 31, Union home minister Amit Shah handed job appointment letters to the next of kin. Dalbir Singh, who lost his brother Ranjit Singh, a grocery shop owner, received one. “He never married. He was calm and lovable,” Dalbir said. “I feel the sky has fallen on us. I just want this to end.”At least five members of the local Sikh community died, including former Army officer Amarjeet Singh, homemaker Ruby Kaur, and neighbour Amreek Singh. A gurdwara wall was damaged in the shelling. As Poonch recovers from three days of unrelenting fire, scars remain — carved in stone and memory.","14 civilians lost their lives, including students, religious teachers, shopkeepers, homemakers, and former soldiers.
