"BJP set to contest Haryana polls on its own, declares Shah",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/bjp-set-to-contest-haryana-polls-on-its-own-declares-shah/articleshow/111370558.cms,"NEW DELHI: Undeterred by the loss of five seats during Lok Sabha polls in Haryana, senior BJP leader and home minister Amit Shah on Saturday announced that the party will contest the forthcoming assembly polls in the state solo and exhorted party workers to gear up for a two-thirds majority .""We have lost a few seats in Haryana by small margins but our vote share has gone up by 5% from 2014.This time too, we will not ally with anyone and will contest on our own and win. This time, we must win Haryana with a two-third majority,"" Shah said, in his first public rally after Lok Sabha polls, as he addressed BJP workers at Panchkula.The decision to go alone is significant after Congress halved BJP's tally from the state. Just before LS polls, Dushyant Chautala-led Jannayak Janta Party (JJP), which was an ally of BJP in the state, severed ties and contested the polls on its own. Shah made it clear that the party does not intend to make concessions to woo the former ally back.Shah sought to play down BJP's less-than-expected performance in LS polls , focusing instead on Narendra Modi's feat in being the first PM in 60 years to score a third consecutive victory ""How can this be possible without the blessings of the people of India?"" the home minister said.He said that Congress is trying to make their defeat in the Lok Sabha election look like a victory through false propaganda."" BJP got 5% more votes in the last election than in the previous election. On the other hand, BJP alone has won more seats than the total number of seats won by all INDI Alliance parties,"" the home minister asserted.He dubbed Congress as a party of dynasts and referred to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi as ""Tara"" and former CM B S Hooda's son Deepender Singh Hooda as ""Sitara"". ""Tara and Sitara cannot have their sway in Haryana. Sonia Ji's Tara and Hooda Saheb's Sitara won't shine in Haryana anymore.""Sensing strong resistance from Congress after the loss of five seats in Lok Sabha polls in the state, the BJP brass has taken measures to improve the party prospects in the state polls, appointing party's key strategist Dharmendra Pradhan as poll in-charge and former Tripura CM Biplab Deb as his deputy.","BJP will contest the forthcoming assembly polls in the state solo and exhorted party workers to gear up for a two-thirds majority.

Opposition may field SP's Faizabad MP for dy Speaker contest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/oppn-may-field-sps-faizabad-mp-for-dy-speaker-contest/articleshow/111370280.cms,"KOLKATA: Trinamool Congress , Samajwadi Party and Congress are exploring the option of projecting SP's Faizabad MP Awadhesh Prasad as INDIA bloc 's deputy Speaker candidate. Prasad (78) is a Dalit who won the unreserved seat that covers Ayodhya. This comes amid reports that Congress was keen to have K Suresh - an eight-time MP from Kerala - as opposition bloc's deputy speaker pick.TMC general secretary Abhishek Banerjee, Samajwadi president Akhilesh Yadav and Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi have already discussed this and are likely to take it up with other allies, said sources.The sources added the nomination of Prasad was an idea of West Bengal chief minister and TMC chief Mamata Banerjee, who conveyed it to nephew Abhishek.According to sources, the three INDIA bloc senior partners seemed to agree that Prasad would be an ""out-of-the-box"" candidate and his nomination would carry ""strong symbolism"" as he won the high-stakes contest by over 50,000 votes.While conferring with Rahul and Akhilesh, Abhishek suggested that choosing INDIA bloc's deputy Speaker pick should ""send out a strong message"", said sources. He focused on symbolism since numbers don't stack up for INDIA bloc if there is a contest.A Trinamool MP said: ""INDIA bloc will contest for the deputy Speaker's post. In the remaining three days of this session... even later... we will collectively demand the post. A consensus is being worked out on possible nominees.""Article 93 of the Constitution says the Lok Sabha ""shall choose two of its members as Speaker and deputy Speaker"". The 17th LS was the first since Independence which didn't have a deputy Speaker.Asked about the situation in which NDA didn't accept the opposition's proposal of a deputy speaker election, the TMC MP added: ""The 17th Lok Sabha and the 18th Lok Sabha are very different. There's an NDA govt now, not a BJP govt. We will continue to aggressively push for the election in this session and all following sessions.""","TMC general secretary Abhishek Banerjee, Samajwadi president Akhilesh Yadav and Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi have already discussed this.

It should not be interpreted as Hindu voters being angry with BJP.You have to understand the mind of Hindu society. Hindus do not think that religion and social order are one, but the Muslim society does.""She went on to add: ""No one should manifest the arrogance that every Ram Bhakt will vote for BJP. The voter may have voted for anyone but his devotion for Lord Ram has not decreased. And neither should Prime Minister Narendra Modi or chief minister Yogi Adityanath be blamed (for the results).""The Ram Janmabhoomi leader argued that the issue of Mathura and Kashi have no connection with the defeat in UP. “When the Babri structure was demolished on Dec 6, then too we lost Uttar Pradesh. But Ayodhya remained on BJP’s agenda. So will these (Mathura and Kashi). The Ram Mandir issue has its own place while victory and defeat have a separate standing. You should not connect both,” she said.It should also not be interpreted that since BJP lost in Ayodhya, people do not have faith in Lord Ram, she remarked, adding: “Lord Ram is everything for all Sanatanis. Lord Ram is the Universe. That is why one should keep election results away from Ram Mandir.”Asked why BJP failed to achieve its 400-plus target, Bharti said, “Ask Jagat Prakash Nadda about this.
