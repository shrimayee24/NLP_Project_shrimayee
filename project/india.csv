Mehta has been summoned for questioning at the ED headquarters on Friday.Appearing before a bench headed by CJI Surya Kant, senior advocate C A Sundaram said allowing Enforcement Directorate to open the phone would violate Mehta's privacy and pleaded that ED be restrained from doing so till the next date of hearing on Tuesday.

The advocate then remarked that the court was presuming his guilt.While ED seized digital devices from I-PAC's Delhi office during its Jan 8 search operation, it could not do the same in Kolkata as the West Bengal Police brass interrupted the search proceedings on the firm's premises in the presence of TMC chief and CM Mamata Banerjee .

The govt had sought time, and later, MHA formed a panel headed by director I4C for formulating guidelines to curb the indiscriminate seizure of digital devices. The govt had also argued that till then the CBI manual be allowed to be followed by all central agencies.",Jitendra Mehta has been summoned for questioning at the ED headquarters on Friday.

“Democracy Sliding Into ICU”: Opposition Targets BJP As BMC Polls Trigger Political Storm







MUMBAI: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is poised to take the Mumbai mayor’s post for the first time since the 1980s, with the party narrowing its choice to several women corporators.The post was reserved for a woman from the open category in a draw of lots held on Thursday by the Urban Development Department.Party insiders say the selection will balance organisational priorities with electoral strategy, as the BJP returns to the mayor’s chair after nearly 40 years — the last BJP mayor being Dr Prabhakar Pai in the 1980s.Other names in contention include Tejasvee Ghosalkar from Dahisar, a former Shiv Sena (UBT) corporator seen as a tactical choice linked to deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde’s plan to mark the birth centenary of late Bal Thackeray.Additional possibilities include Harshita Narvekar from Fort, Priti Satam from Goregaon, Yogita Koli from Malad, Shital Gambhir from Mahim, and Swapna Mhatre from Bandra West.",The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is poised to take the Mumbai mayor’s post for the first time since the 1980s.

“Democracy Sliding Into ICU”: Opposition Targets BJP As BMC Polls Trigger Political Storm

Earlier too, MNS was with us (Mahayuti) in LS and assembly elections. The alliance of BJP and Shiv Sena is not just for now. Now MNS has also participated in it. We are seeing who benefited and who lost from the (UBT Sena-MNS) alliance, Raj has never looked at personal gain.""He has always taken decisions from a broader perspective. He had supported PM Modi on development. He had also supported us in the assembly elections. Raj Thackeray values feelings of his workers,” Shinde added further.Shinde said there was no tussle between Sena and BJP over the mayor’s post in BMC and added the mayor will be from Mahayuti. In a dig at Sena (UBT), he said those who don’t have numbers must not dream of getting their mayor elected.
