'Protest against perversion'

Badlapur protest

NEW DELHI: In a significant legal direction, the Bombay High Court on Friday issued a restraining order against any political party or individual from calling for a Maharashtra Bandh.""We are restraining any political party or individual from proceeding with call for bandh. We will also direct the State to take all steps in terms of B G Deshmukh judgment,"" said Chief Justice Devendra Kumar Upadhyaya.The order comes just days after the opposition Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) had announced plans for a statewide bandh on August 24 to protest against an incident of rape of two minors in Badlapur.The HC issued notice to the Congress, Shiv Sena-UBT and Sharad Pawar-NCP, and restrained them from proceeding with the call for bandh on Saturday or on any other subsequent day. The notices are made returnable on October 9.The court directed the chief secretary, additional chief secretary (home), DGP and district collectors shall enforce directions given in HC's 2004 judgment.After the order, NCP-SCP chief Sharad Pawar tweeted: ""In the wake of the Badlapur incident, a statewide public shutdown was called for on 24 August 2024. This was an attempt to draw the government's attention to this matter. This bandh was within the purview of the Fundamental Rights of the Constitution of India. However Bombay High Court has ruled that the bandh is unconstitutional. Urgent appeal in Supreme Court is not possible due to time limit. As the Indian Judiciary is a constitutional institution, it is requested to withdraw tomorrow's bandh while respecting the Constitution.""Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole said the parties will respect the court's order.""Honouring Bombay High Court judgement, all Congress leaders will protest in all Maharashtra district headquarters with black bands on their face/mouth from 11 AM to 12 noon against the cases of sexual harassment against women and failure of Maharashtra govt to prevent that. I will be part of the protest in Thane district,"" said Patole.Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray also said he disagreed with the HC order but would not carry on with the strike. ""We don’t agree with Bombay High Court order on bandh ... We have called off August 24 Maharashtra bandh but opposition leaders will protest with black bands around their mouth,"" said Thackeray.Earlier in the day, Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray had demanded the withdrawal of cases against those who protested in Badlapur over the alleged sexual abuse of two kindergarten girls, warning that the opposition would take to the streets if this demand is not met.Speaking to the media, Thackeray emphasized that the August 24 'Maharashtra Bandh' called by the opposition bloc is aimed at protesting against ""perversion"" and urging people from all communities to join in.Thackeray said the bandh would represent the voices of the state's citizens. He criticised the Eknath Shinde government's handling of the Badlapur protest , stating, ""Arrests are still taking place in Badlapur. The cases against the protesters must be withdrawn or else we have to hit the streets.""A significant protest had erupted in Badlapur town in Thane district on August 20 after thousands demonstrated and blocked railway tracks against the alleged sexual assault of two four-year-old girls by a male attendant at a local school. The protest led to the injury of at least 25 police personnel due to stone-pelting at the railway station and other areas in Badlapur.Police have arrested 72 individuals related to the violence during the protest. The accused, arrested on August 17, remains in police custody until August 26.In response to the bandh call, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar had emphasised the government's commitment to maintaining normalcy and functionality. He also accused the opposition of politicising the tragedy and asserted that the government would take necessary actions against the accused in the Badlapur case.",The Bombay High Court on Friday issued a restraining order against any political party or individual from calling for a Maharashtra Bandh.

The SIT, comprising four senior IPS officers, was tasked with probing irregularities at the state-run hospital since Jan 2021, he pointed out.Ghosh's counsel Biswaroop Bhattacharya challenged Justice Bharadwaj's order before a division bench of justices Harish Tandon and Hiranmay Bhattacharyya, saying it was issued without giving his client a hearing.

One of those famous one-liners from this 78-year-old MLA of Hisar district was: “Akela hi jeem gaya sara, bhale manas aur bhee log basade honge (He gobbled all the powerful departments; good fellow, other people also reside in this world).”This was after Dushyant received several important ministries in Manohar Lal Khattar-led BJP-JJP coalition govt that assumed office on Oct 27, 2019.Later, commenting on Dushyant, Gautam said: “Sauda e kime nahin (He has no worth).” These one-liners went viral on social media and made him Dushyant’s biggest critic, within and outside JJP.In almost five years of disassociation from the JJP on whose ticket he was elected an MLA, Gautam, a lawyer, has managed to ensure that none of actions or utterances could lead to his disqualifica tion from the assembly under the anti-defection law.Being senior-most legislator of JJP’s 10 MLAs in 2019, Gautam had hoped to be made a minister in the BJP-JJP coalition government. However, Anoop Dhanak was made a minister instead. In Dec 2021’s second cabinet extension, Dushyant picked Devender Singh Babli as a minister instead of the Narnaund MLA.Gautam disassociated himself from the JJP within just a few days of the coalition govt’s formation in 2019. Despite being JJP’s national vice-president, Gautam never attended any of its meetings since rebelling against Dushyant. In Dec 2019, when Gautam resigned from this party post, Dushyant said he could understand why he was grumpy, but said that the JJP had to consider several factors in picking its ministers. Gautam at the time denied that he harboured any ministerial ambitions.Gautam was first elected as an MLA from Narnaund seat in Hisar district in 2005 on a BJP ticket. He then came close to former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda of the Congress. In 2019, he joined the JJP and emerged as a giant-killer when he defeated the state’s former finance minister Captain Abhimanyu of the BJP from Narnaund by 12,000-odd votes.After his rebellion against Dushyant, Gautam appreciated the policies of JJP’s coalition partner BJP and its then chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar. His son is a law officer in the state advocate general’s office — a job that demands strong connections in the governing party and terminates with its tenure — and continued on the post even after JJP and BJP ended their coalition.Even in the parliamentary elections, Gautam, who is a lawyer, had praised the BJP and gave his workers freedom to vote for any party but made it clear that his choice was Prime Minister Narendra Modi.",Six of Dushyant Chautala’s 10 Haryana legislators quit Jannayak Janta Party.
