NEW DELHI: A war of words erupted between Rajya Sabha chairperson Jagdeep Dhankhar and leader of opposition Mallikarjun Kharge on Tuesday after the former sarcastically told Congress member Jairam Ramesh to take the latter’s post of LoP.Kharge, who is a Dalit, said Dhankhar was bringing in the “Varna” (caste) system by calling Ramesh “intelligent and gifted”, and by implication labelling him “dull”.An agitated Dhankhar then rapped Kharge for “twisting” his remarks.The acrimonious exchange began when Congress member and deputy LoP Pramod Tiwari was attacking the govt for “betrayal” on multiple fronts during the motion of thanks on the President’s address. When Dhankhar told Tiwari not to make unverified claims, Ramesh interjected to say that they would be authenticated.“The senior leadership (Kharge) is here. I think you (Ramesh) should replace (Kharge).... You are so intelligent, so gifted, so talented, you should immediately come and take the seat in place of Kharge because, by and large, you are doing his job,” the chairperson said.Kharge promptly retorted: “Don’t bring in the Varna system. It is still in your mind... that is why you are saying Ramesh is very intelligent... and that I am dull so that I should be replaced.”Accusing Kharge of “twisting” his statement, Dhankhar said he did not mean anything like that. “You cannot run down the Chair all the time. Never in the history of Parliamentary democracy and Rajya Sabha proceedings, has there been such disregard of the Chair. I have a lot of patience and tolerate so much,” Dhankhar said.Adding that Ramesh was always passing some comment or the other, the Chairperson said, “There is a problem which you have to solve.” Pointing to Congress leader Sonia Gandhi sitting next to him, Kharge said it was she and the people who had made him LoP, “not Jairam Ramesh or you”.","Kharge said Dhankhar was bringing in the “Varna” (caste) system by calling Ramesh “intelligent and gifted”, and by implication labelling him “dull” DhankHar then rapped Kharge for “twisting” his remarks.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111443898,imgsize-68886,width-400,resizemode-4/111443898.jpg"

According to sources, Modi attributed the opposition’s discontent to the fact that, for the first time, a non-Congress leader has been elected PM for a third consecutive term.Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju said that the PM encouraged MPs to thoroughly examine parliamentary matters, maintain regular attendance, and effectively address issues pertaining to their constituencies.“He gave us a mantra which is very important. He said that every MP has been elected to the House to serve the nation. Irrespective of the party they belong to, service to the nation is our first responsibility. Every NDA MP has to work by prioritising the country, this is what the PM urged,” Rijiju told reporters.“Second, the PM guided us well regarding the conduct of MPs. He said that every MP should present the matters of their constituency in the House very well as per rules. He also told us to develop expertise in other major issues of interest — be it water, environment, social area. So, the PM told us to develop expertise in those areas. The PM urged NDA MPs to follow the rules of Parliament, parliamentary democracy system and conduct which is essential to becoming agood MP,” he added.When asked if PM Modi alluded to Rahul’s speech in the Lok Sabha on Monday, Rijiju clarified that no specific mention was made.Rahul had launched a scathing attack on BJP in the Lok Sabha, accusing the party’s leaders of fostering communal divisions for electoral gains. His remarks drew strong protests from the treasury benches, with the PM criticising the Congress leader for labelling the entire Hindu community as violent.",PM Narendra Modi on Tuesday urged NDA MPs to adhere to parliamentary norms and effectively voice their concerns. The remarks came a day after the BJP-led alliance criticised leader of opposition (LoP) Rahul Gandhi for delivering what they deemed ‘a most irresponsible’ speech.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111444840,imgsize-1929856,width-400,resizemode-4/111444840.jpg"
"PM Modi hits back in LS: Congress a ‘parasite’, Rahul ‘childish’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-attacks-cong-says-party-trying-to-push-nation-into-throes-of-anarchy/articleshow/111444115.cms,"NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Tuesday launched a furious attack on Congress and Rahul Gandhi , saying the opposition party and its “ecosystem” had been trying to spin its third consecutive electoral loss as a “moral victory” even as it had emerged as a “parasite”, and the newly-appointed leader of opposition was exhibiting childish exuberance (“baalak buddhi”).“No matter how much you shout and scream, the mandate is very clear, you have to again sit in the opposition,” said Modi amid consistent heckling by members of Congress that led Speaker Om Birla to reprimand Rahul Gandhi for directing MPs to occupy the well in front of the PM.Replying to the motion of thanks on the President’s address in Lok Sabha, Modi said, “It would have been better had Congress understood the message instead of indulging itself with fake victory celebra tions which cannot gloss over the fact that it is the third time in a row that the party has failed to get a triple-digit score and that the June 4 verdict marked Congress’s third worst-ever performance.”Modi also took on Rahul for “childish whining”, referring to his complaints about being wronged by the Spea ker. “Like the boy who comes from school to whine to his mother that he has been bullied, but who would never admit his own mistake, a fresh drama is being enacted to garner sympathy,” he said, referring to the ongoing cases against Rahul.Defying the consistent sloganeering from opposition members which at times threatened to drown his voice,PM Modi on Tuesday drew upon famous dialogues from popular Bollywood movies to dismiss the estimate about June 4 being the coming-of-age moment for Rahul Gandhi. “The ecosystem is, much like mausi in Sholay, trying to flatter the party by saying that you may have lost again, but you have scored a moral victory,” said Modi.“But the people have seen through it and have a simple message, inse na ho payega (you just don’t have it in you),” the PM said, borrowing the famous line from ‘Gangs of Wasseypur’, something that sparked a flurry of memes on social media. The PM was replying to the motion of thanks on the President’s Address.“Just like the whining child who would never acknowledge that he had tore somebody’s book, abused another, called the teacher a thief and stole somebody’s lunch... Similarly, it is not disclosed that he (Rahul) is on bail in a cheating case involving thousands of crores, that he has been convicted for maligning OBCs, that SC held him guilty of making irresponsible statements and that he is facing trial for maligning Veer Savarkar,” said the PM in the fiercest direct assault on Rahul. The leader of opposition is on bail in the money laundering case related to the alleged National Herald scam.He also reiterated his protest over Rahul’s attack on “those who call themselves Hindus”. Modi said the effort to establish an equation between Hindus and violence was well deliberated. “A conspiracy has been hatched to target the community... People will not forgive this for centuries.”Modi said use of images of deities for personal political interests marked an “insult to our Gods”. He added, “Hindus have to decide whether what happened was just coincidence (sanjog) or part of a deliberate effort (prayog)”.The Prime Minister also had tough words for the “ecosystem” — BJP’s shorthand for Congress supporters among the intelligentsia.“The habits of the ecosystem, flourishing for 70 years, the way they have decided to stop the nation’s progress, and derail its development, I want to warn them... that the answer to all their conspiracies will be given in their language. This country will never accept anti-national conspiracies,” he said.He accused Congress of trying to push the country into the throes of anarchy by pitting regions and castes against each other. “Now they are encouraging their govts in states to take measures which are not feasible. This is part of a dangerous game to create anarchy.”","PM Narendra Modi launches a furious attack on Congress and Rahul Gandhi.
