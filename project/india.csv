AMRITSAR/JALANDHAR: Leader of opposition in the Punjab assembly Partap Singh Bajwa criticised Punjab CM Bhagwant Singh Mann and the state's AAP-led govt even as a US aircraft carrying Indian deportees was to land in Amritsar on Saturday, accusing Mann of failing to curb the human trafficking of Punjabis in the last three yearsThe Congress politician said Punjab Prevention of Human Smuggling Act, 2012, regulated the profession of travel agents to check and curb illegal and fraudulent activities and malpractices of travel agents and others involved in human trafficking in Punjab. ""Can Bhagwant Mann, who also holds the home portfolio, let Punjabis know how many travel agents were booked under the same law in the last three years,"" he asked.Mann, meanwhile, promised that the state govt would first investigate why the deportees had gone abroad, which agents deceived them, and how much money they had lost, so that efforts could be made to recover the money. He also said 10 FIRs had been registered against the travel agents in earlier cases and investigation had begun.Touching upon the returnees' rehabilitation, he said govt will provide them opportunities based on their skills - whether it's helping them open a restaurant if they worked in one, or offering employment if they clear a competency exam. He reiterated that Centre was determined to transform the holy city - home to the Golden Temple, Durgiana Temple, Ram Teerath, and Jallianwala Bagh, along with its rich textile heritage - into a ""deporation centre"".Expressing sympathy for Indians being deported from the US, Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee offered to provide them transportation from the airport to their homes. In a statement issued ahead of the arrival of another plane from the US on Saturday, SGPC president Harjinder Singh Dhami said the committee was ready to also arrange accommodation for the deportees. ""Those in need can approach the SGPC staff stationed at the airport for assistance,"" said Dhami.He also expressed concern over the ""inhumane treatment"" of the deportees, asking why they were being treated in such a manner. BJP national secretary and now Delhi MLA Manjinder Singh Sirsa too attacked Mann, alleging that travel agents in Punjab had looted these deportees while Mann's govt and Punjab police kept on taking money from the unscrupulous travel agents. ""Otherwise, how could such travel agents have a thriving business in Punjab,"" he asked.Punjab BJP also posted on its social media accounts asking Mann if Punjab's reputation was not tarnished ""when there were explosions in Punjab, homes were being destroyed daily by drugs, gangsters were demanding ransoms, unemployed teachers were being beaten, and Punjab was drowning in debt."" The party unit reminded him of his promise of building a system where children would return from abroad, and even foreigners would seek jobs here, but no policy for this had been implemented in three years of his govt.Punjabi netizens, meanwhile, criticised Punjab CM for not speaking up and raising questions when the first plane carrying deportees landed at Amritsar even though it carried more deportees from Gujarat and Haryana than from Punjab.","Partap Singh Bajwa accuses Bhagwant Singh Mann of failing to curb human trafficking of Punjabis in the last three years.

Accused's lawyer: Murder case did not reach court. What can we do?

MEERUT: A court in UP's Bulandshahr has pulled up police for failing to file a chargesheet in a 26-year-old murder case despite arresting the accused, recovering the alleged murder weapon and even filing a separate chargesheet against him in an arms Act case.The lapse, which allowed the accused to remain a free man for over two decades, came to light only when the arms Act case was recently heard in court.Expressing strong displeasure over the negligence, the judge ordered immediate filing of the charge sheet and an inquiry into why it had not been submitted earlier. Police are now scampering to find answers and frame a charge sheet.In March 1999, 65-year-old Lakkhi Singh was murdered by unidentified assailants in Bulandshahr's Kotwali area. His son, Vijaypal Singh, lodged a police complaint, and an FIR was duly registered. During the investigation, police arrested Lakkhi's grandson and Vijaypal's nephew Kailash Chand , now 55 years old, accusing him of murder over a property dispute. A pistol allegedly used in the crime was seized from him, leading to a case under the Arms Act. However, Kailash was granted bail within days due to lack of evidence. Charge sheet for the murder, though, was never filed in court, and Kailash was never formally put on trial, allowing him to continue living freely.District judge Manjit Singh Shyoran, who was hearing Arms Act case, discovered the ""serious lapse"" and questioned why the fard challan, a receipt issued when case documents are filed in court, was missing. The advocate handling the case must submit this receipt. If police had filed the charge sheet, the fard challan too would have been deposited.Kailash's advocate, Dolly Sharma, criticised police for failing in their duty. ""My client has been attending hearings for Arms Act case, but the murder case has not reached court. What can we do?""Bulandshahr SSP Shlok Kumar confirmed receiving a letter from the court regarding the issue. ""An in-depth investigation is underway,"" he said.Officials are now trying to determine why the charge sheet was not filed, who was responsible for the error, and whether any police personnel should be held accountable now that a quarter of a century has gone by.",A court in UP's Bulandshahr has pulled up police for failing to file a chargesheet in a 26-year-old murder case.

Defections setback for AAP, BJP likely to win Mayor poll

Also read:

NEW DELHI: BJP became the single largest party in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi with three AAP councillors switching their allegiance to the party on Saturday, opening up the possibility of a triple engine government in Delhi.BJP, which is also in office at the Centre, had won the assembly polls on February 8, securing 48 seats while AAP won 22 in the 70-member House. In MCD, following the crossing over of three councillors, BJP's strength has risen to 116 while AAP has 114 seats and Congress eight in the 250-member body. The three councillors who joined BJP were Anita Basoya from Andrews Ganj, Nikhil Chaprana from Hari Nagar and Dharmveer Singh from R K Puram. Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva said the city would soon experience triple-engine governance.Out of 22 councillors from three parties who contested the assembly elections, 11 won, with BJP securing eight seats and AAP winning three. MCD now has 12 vacancies, including that of Kamaljeet Sehrawat, who was elected an MP.Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the country is progressing rapidly, and now it is Delhi's turn. The people of Delhi, who have given a majority mandate to BJP in the assembly elections, will soon begin to see the results once the new govt is formed. To build a beautiful and developed Delhi, continuous efforts will be required to complete the development projects that were stalled in the past 10 years and realise BJP's vision for a progressive Delhi,"" said Sachdeva, asserting that individuals committed to Delhi's development are choosing to join BJP. No statement had been received from AAP on this issue till late on Saturday.The political landscape shifted when an AAP councillor (Ram Chander from Shahbaad Dairy) defected to BJP on Jan 28, taking the party's strength to 113. With Saturday's development, BJP's strength has increased to 116, enhancing the party's chances of clinching the mayor's post.Officials pointed out that Delhi Municipal Corporation (DMC) Act does not require by-elections for vacant seats prior to mayoral elections. If these positions remain unfilled before the poll in April, BJP's chances of securing the mayoral post will increase, unless there is cross-voting or Congress supports another party, which seems unlikely given their stance in the assembly elections. The anti-defection law does not apply to MCD.The mayoral elections are scheduled annually during the first meeting of the civic body's new session in April with no reservation criteria applicable for the post this year. The election for the deputy mayor's position will be conducted at the same meeting and will be open to all general candidates.The mayoral election process in Delhi involves an electoral college consisting of 250 councillors, 10 MPs (seven from Lok Sabha and three from Rajya Sabha) and 14 MLAs chosen by the assembly Speaker. Additionally, 10 aldermen are part of the process but lack voting rights in house proceedings or mayoral elections.Previously, AAP dominated with 62 assembly seats. It has nominated 13 MLAs along with one BJP representative. They also had support from three AAP Rajya Sabha MPs. However, the scenario has changed now with BJP holding 48 assembly seats and AA. Before the mayoral polls, the assembly speaker will confirm the nominations with expectations that the governing party will nominate more BJP MLAs for MCD (potentially 12). Combined with support from seven LS members, BJP is poised to gain a 15-16 vote advantage in the forthcoming election.The Nov mayoral elections, which faced an eight-month delay, saw AAP clinch a close victory. Their candidate, Mahesh Kumar Khichi, edged past BJP's Kishan Lal by three votes. The final tally showed AAP garnering 133 votes against BJP's 130. This result proved surprising, considering AAP's initial strength of 143, including two Congress councillors who switched allegiance, compared to BJP's 122 before the civic centre proceedings began.Leader of Opposition and former mayor Sardar Raja Iqbal Singh demanded the resignation of mayor Mahesh Kumar on ethical grounds. He stated that AAP, which has lost public support in the Assembly, has now also lost the trust of the Municipal House. "" The BJP's councillors have increased to 116, while AAP now only has 114 councillors. In this situation, without a majority in the House, the Mayor has no right to remain in office and should resign on ethical grounds,"" he said.","Defections setback for AAP, BJP likely to win Mayor poll in Delhi.
