Bid to incite public will lead to nixing of bail: High court to Rampal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bid-to-incite-public-will-lead-to-nixing-of-bail-high-court-to-rampal/articleshow/123709481.cms,"CHANDIGARH: Punjab and Haryana HC suspended the life sentence awarded to controversial preacher Rampal in connection with the 2014 murder case of his follower but warned him against disturbing public peace upon release.

Rampal, of Satlok Ashram in Barwala, Hisar in Haryana, has been in jail for over a decade since his arrest.The division bench of justices Gurvinder Singh Gill and Deepinder Singh Nalwa ordered, ""The applicant (Rampal) is directed not to promote any kind of 'mob mentality' and avoid participating in congregations where there is any kind of tendency amongst 'disciples' or participants to cause a breach in peace, law, and order"". Rampal had filed a petition seeking suspension of his life term.He was sentenced on Oct 11, 2018, by a Hisar court for murder, wrongful confinement, and criminal conspiracy after a follower, Raj Bala, died of asphyxia. His counsel argued she died when police lobbed tear gas shells at his dera, causing suffocation and stampede. He said there was no evidence linking Rampal to the death.The state counsel countered that Rampal held women & others hostage and confined them in a room, leading to their death from suffocation. A total of five women followers died in the incident, for which Rampal was awarded life imprisonment separately.Suspending the sentence, HC observed that eyewitnesses, who are relatives of the deceased, did not support the prosecution's case. Rather, they stated that conditions of suffocation were created due to teargas shells.","Punjab and Haryana HC suspended the life sentence awarded to controversial preacher Rampal in connection with the 2014 murder case of his follower.

Poll Do you think protests will effectively change the political situation in Punjab? Yes No





PATIALA: AAP MLA Harmeet Singh Pathanmajra has allegedly escaped police custody while being taken to a local police station after his arrest.According to Punjab Police sources, Pathanmajra and his accomplices fired at police officers during the escape and even ran over one personnel, leaving him injured.According to reports, Pathanmajra and his accomplices ran over police personnel with an SUV.The Sanour MLA was arrested a day after publicly criticising his party’s Delhi leadership.His detention in Patiala was linked to a rape case filed against him, sparking political uproar in the region.In a social media post, Pathanmajra claimed the case related to his former wife and alleged that the fresh charges of rape were politically motivated.“I was booked because I raised my voice against my own government, especially the Delhi leadership,” he wrote.His brother, Hardev Singh, said the MLA was taken into custody under Section 376 of the IPC despite already having been granted bail by the Punjab and Haryana High Court. “He was arrested from Dabri in Haryana in a case where bail was already granted. This is clearly an attempt to silence him,” he alleged.CIA Patiala confirmed that three weapons have been recovered and one accomplice of MLA Pathanmajra has been arrested.The arrested individual has been identified as Balwinder Singh, while the search for MLA Pathanmajra continues.Police said two officers were injured when stones were thrown at them during the MLA’s escape attempt.Authorities added that supporters of the MLA not only pelted stones but also opened fire at the police team.Before his arrest, Pathanmajra had appealed to colleagues and supporters via Facebook to protest outside the Patiala SSP’s office at the Mini Secretariat. He urged people to reach “in tractors, trolleys, and cars” to demand his release. “I will not be silenced even if more cases are registered against me. Will AAP’s Delhi leadership rule Punjabis now? Even Congress and BJP did not interfere to this extent,” he said.The MLA has repeatedly accused the party’s central leadership of sidelining Punjab leaders and “remote-controlling” the state. Recently, he criticised officials of the Irrigation Department over flood relief efforts in his constituency. Soon after, his security cover was withdrawn and police officers in the area were reshuffled — moves that raised eyebrows.“This is retaliation. They looted Punjab more than Abdali. Now they want to sell Punjab,” Pathanmajra declared.","Harmeet Singh Pathanmajra allegedly escaped police custody while being taken to a local police station after his arrest.

Massive Chaos in Bengal Assembly: BJP and TMC Trade 'Chor' Jibes, Mamata Speech Triggers Ruckus

NEW DELHI: The West Bengal Assembly on Thursday witnessed uproar as MLAs of the ruling TMC and opposition BJP raised slogans, disrupting a discussion on a government resolution concerning alleged atrocities against Bengali migrants.The disruption began when chief minister Mamata Banerjee was about to speak on the resolution. BJP legislators raised slogans and questioned the suspension of Leader of the Opposition Suvendu Adhikari on September 2, leading to strong protests from the treasury benches.Addressing the House, Banerjee accused the BJP of being against Bangla-speaking people.""I condemn BJP for their persecution of Bengalis. A time will soon come when not a single BJP MLA will remain in Bengal. The people themselves will ensure it. BJP will face inevitable defeat, for no party that wages linguistic terror against Bengalis can ever win Bengal,"" she said.She also called the BJP a party of ""vote chor"".""BJP is a party of vote-chors, corrupt to the core, persecutors of Bengalis, and masters of deception. BJP is a national disgrace, and I condemn them in the strongest terms,"" Banerjee said.The chief minister further accused the BJP of blocking a discussion on alleged attacks on Bengali migrant workers in BJP-ruled states.""Why is the BJP against discussion on the attacks on Bengali migrants? It is because these incidents are taking place in states ruled by the party. They want to suppress the truth,"" she claimed.Amid continuous sloganeering, Banerjee asked, ""Why is the BJP not allowing me to speak in this House?""She added, ""We are not against Hindi or any other language, but the BJP is clearly anti-Bengali. Their attitude shows a colonial and dictatorial mindset. They want to turn West Bengal into their colony.""As the protests continued, Speaker Biman Banerjee suspended BJP chief whip Shankar Ghosh for the rest of the day for creating disorder. When Ghosh refused to leave, assembly marshals were called in and he was dragged out of the House.Later, BJP MLAs Agnimitra Paul, Mihir Goswami, Bankim Ghosh and Ashok Dinda were subsequently suspended as the ruckus intensified.BJP legislators alleged that water bottles were thrown at them from the treasury benches during the commotion.Marshals remained on guard inside the House to prevent any physical clash between the two sides.Banerjee criticised the conduct of BJP legislators, saying they were trying to derail a discussion on the situation of Bengali migrants.Intensifying her criticism, the Bengal CM also alleged that the BJP’s ""ideological ancestors"" had betrayed the country during the freedom movement.""The BJP is a party of dictators. Their ancestors did not fight for India’s Independence; they betrayed the country,"" she said.As the exchanges grew heated, some MLAs from the treasury benches moved towards the opposition benches, prompting marshals to step in. The uproar forced Banerjee to briefly pause her speech.She further alleged that the BJP-led Union government had ""sold the prestige"" of India before foreign powers, claiming that the Centre was ""at times begging before the United States, and at times before China.""Meanwhile, replying to CM Mamata Banerjee's address in the House, West Bengal LoP and BJP MLA Suvendu Adhikari, ""She abused the Modi community...Mamata Banerjee will have to go. A case will be registered against her.""Despite the ruckus, the House was not adjourned.",The disruption began when chief minister Mamata Banerjee was about to speak on the resolution.

RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat’s Big Statement: Hindu-Muslim Already One, Muslims Deserve Equal Job Rights

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday granted anticipatory bail to cartoonist Hemant Malviya, accused of sharing “objectionable” cartoons of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Rashtriya Swayam Sangh (RSS) workers on social media.Earlier, on July 15, the top court had given him interim protection from coercive action—a relief that has now been made “absolute.”A bench of Justices Aravind Kumar and NV Anjaria noted that Malviya had already tendered an apology on his Facebook and Instagram accounts. The court, however, allowed police to seek cancellation of his bail if he failed to cooperate with the investigation.Malviya’s counsel, senior advocate Vrinda Grover, informed the bench that her client had not yet been summoned by police. In response, additional solicitor general KM Nataraj said the summons would be issued once evidence collection was complete.The case dates back to May, when police in Madhya Pradesh's Indore registered an FIR against Malviya based on a complaint by RSS worker and lawyer Vinay Joshi. The complaint alleged that the accused's posts hurt the religious sentiments of Hindus, disturbed communal harmony, and tarnished the RSS’s image.On July 3, the Madhya Pradesh high Court had rejected his plea for anticipatory bail, prompting Malviya to approach the apex court.During its July 15 order, the Supreme Court had also voiced concern over the growing number of objectionable posts on social media and emphasized the need for judicial steps to curb the trend.Malviya faces charges under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita—Sections 196 (acts prejudicial to communal harmony), 299 (deliberate acts to outrage religious feelings), and 352 (intentional insult to provoke breach of peace)—along with Section 67-A of the IT Act, which relates to publishing sexually explicit material online.","Hemant Malviya is accused of sharing ""objectionable"" cartoons of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Rashtriya Swayam Sangh (RSS) workers on social media.
