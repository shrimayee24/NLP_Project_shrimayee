Will oppose bill on quota for Muslim contractors tooth & nail: Karnataka BJP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-oppose-bill-on-quota-for-muslim-contractors-tooth-nail-karnataka-bjp/articleshow/119091660.cms,"The LoP in Karnataka legislative council, Chalavadi Narayanaswamy, on Sunday said BJP will oppose a proposed bill that envisages reservation for religious minorities in govt contracts, a view echoed by state party president BY Vijayendra in Belagavi. Last week, cabinet approved The Karnataka Transparency in Public Procurement (Amendment) Bill, 2025, that seeks to provide 4% reservation in contracts for civil contractors from religious minorities. Govt is likely to introduce the bill in the assembly on Tuesday. ""It is purely aimed at appeasing its Muslim vote bank,"" Narayanaswamy said. ""Reservation based on religion is a violation of the Constitution. We will oppose it tooth and nail in both Houses and outside,"" he added.The previous BJP govt had scrapped 4% reservation for Muslims in jobs and education, introduced by Janata Dal govt led by HD Deve Gowda in 1995, he said. ""But Congress's poll manifesto had promised to restore it although a case is pending in court. Now, Congress is trying to reintroduce the quota in the form of reservation in civil contracts,"" he said.

AAP’s three-year report card

NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) supremo Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday dismissed opposition claims that Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann would be replaced, asserting that Mann would not only complete his five-year term but also seek another.Kejriwal, who recently completed a 10-day Vipassana meditation session, visited the Golden Temple in Amritsar along with Mann and other AAP leaders to mark three years of the party’s government in Punjab.Addressing reporters, Kejriwal identified drugs and corruption as the most pressing issues in Punjab.""Three crore people of Punjab have come together to wage war against drugs and corruption... this is a battle for justice,"" he said, vowing to continue efforts to cleanse the state.Mann echoed the sentiment, saying his government was committed to restoring Punjab to its former glory—“Rangla Punjab” (Prosperous Punjab).Reacting to speculation about Mann’s removal, Kejriwal firmly denied the claims.""Mann saab will complete five years, you do not need to worry... he will complete the next five years as well,"" Kejriwal declared.His remarks come amid Congress leader Partap Singh Bajwa’s recent claim that 32 AAP MLAs were in touch with him and that Mann himself was in discussions with the BJP. Bajwa alleged that Kejriwal could remove Mann anytime, forcing him to switch sides.Mann highlighted his government's achievements, stating that 52,000 government jobs had been provided to Punjab’s youth.""The work that has been done in these three years has not been done even in the last 70 years,"" Mann claimed in a post on X.He vowed to intensify the fight against drugs, urging people to continue supporting AAP’s vision for Punjab.As the party gears up for the next election cycle, the battle against drugs and corruption remains central to its governance narrative.","Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) supremo Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday dismissed opposition claims that Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann would be replaced.

Siddaramaiah himself is keen on releasing it but has faced stiff opposition from politically dominant castes, with his deputy and Vokkaliga strongman DK Shivakumar himself leading the resistance.Other cabinet heavyweights like industries minister MB Patil and forest minister Eshwar Khandre, both Lingayats, have also opposed the report. Their main argument is that the data aren't ""scientific"" and the numbers are based on ""old"" census (population) figures.Intense lobbying by functionaries of dominant communities had forced Congress' high command to intervene and put a lid on the report. Sources in the chief minister's office, govt, and Congress indicate the administration might either permanently withhold the report or revise it with updated population figures once the pending central census data are available.""The problem is that some in the party are unwilling to accept the report,"" said a source.But some senior Congressmen like BK Hariprasad insist the report will be made public at some point. ""There is no possibility of backtracking since it is a promise in Congress's manifesto. Even members of our high command like Rahul Gandhi want a caste census and are pushing for one at the national level,"" Hariprasad said.Hariprasad admitted that though there was no mention of caste census in the budget earlier this month, the report was accepted by govt and must be released.

NEW DELHI: Former Bihar minister and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tej Pratap Yadav is facing massive backlash from all quarters for his "" dance or be suspended "" remark to a policeman during Holi celebrations. On Saturday, he accused BJP, RSS , and media of politicising the festival and spreading hatred.""Don't mind, it's Holi... Even this festival of mutual brotherhood has been given a new colour of hatred by the BJP, RSS, and their lapdog media...,"" Yadav posted on X in Hindi, alongside a cartoon mocking media organisations.""Doing politics over celebrating Holi with police personnel or any opposition leader has become their religion. The people of the country will soon teach them a lesson,"" he added.The uproar erupted after a video from a Holi celebration at Yadav’s official residence in Patna on Friday, March 14, went viral. In the clip, the former Bihar minister was heard telling a police officer,(If you don’t dance, you will be suspended).The remark triggered sharp reactions, particularly from BJP leaders, who accused Yadav of disrespecting the police force.BJP MP Dinesh Sharma criticised Yadav, saying: ""He (Tej Pratap) will never get the right to suspend anyone. And he belongs to a family that insults the police and the uniform...(their family is only fit for drama), they would be considered unfit to run the government.""BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla also attacked Yadav, alleging that he was trying to bring back the era of ""Jungle Raj"" in Bihar.""Like father, like son. Father was the chief minister, the family was in power, and Bihar was kept in jungle raj. He made the law dance to his tunes. Now, he is out of power, but his DNA is the same: he wants to bring back Jungle Raj. Instead of respecting the law and the person wearing the uniform, the way Tej Pratap Yadav has insulted the person wearing the uniform shows that Jungle Raj is in his mindset and DNA, but he should understand that Bihar has changed now. Now there is good governance here.""Several retired senior police officers have also condemned Yadav's comments, calling them an ""insult"" and demanding action against him.Ajay Kumar Singh, a retired Delhi Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP), urged authorities to act against the RJD leader while stressing that no action should be taken against the officer involved, as he was merely following orders.""The uniform has dignity, and we have a code of conduct. It is clearly mentioned in the police manual that police personnel must not act against the code of conduct. Tej Pratap is behaving like an imposter; saying such things to your own security is an insult to the police.""Singh further added: ""We are hurt by this act...The policeman is not at fault—he simply followed orders. Taking action against him would be unfair and unacceptable.""","Tej Pratap Yadav accused BJP, RSS, and media of politicising the festival and spreading hatred.
