"Political parties not workplace, can’t be under POSH Act: SC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/political-parties-not-workplace-cant-be-under-posh-act-sc/articleshow/123908981.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday refused to entertain a petition seeking to bring registered political parties under the ambit of the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition, and Redressal) Act, 2013. ""Subjecting political parties to the POSH Act would open a Pandora's box and become a tool for blackmail,"" it said.Appearing for petitioner Yogamaya G, senior advocate Shobha Gupta told a CJI Gavai-led bench that though many women are active members of political parties, only CPM has set up an internal complaint committee (ICC) with external members. This leaves women in political parties remediless against sexual harassment.Demanding that the law must apply in equal rigour to registered parties which owe allegiance to the Constitution that mandates protection of dignity of women, including safe work atmosphere, the petitioner alleged that AAP lacks transparency about its committee while BJP and Congress have admitted to inadequate ICC structure.But, the bench asked, ""How do you equate political parties as workplace? When a person joins a political party, it is not employment. It is not a job as they join political parties on their own volition and on non-remuneration basis. How can the law against sexual harassment at workplace include political parties?""The bench dismissed the appeal against a 2022 Kerala HC judgment that political parties are under no compulsion to establish ICCs in the absence of employee-employer relationship.","The Supreme Court refused to entertain a petition seeking to bring registered political parties under the ambit of the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace Act, 2013.

He later posted on X: ""The floods have caused severe devastation in Punjab. I met villagers in Ghonewal where homes are ruined, fields destroyed and lives shattered. Both state & central govts must ensure relief packages and compensation reach victims without delay. In this tragedy, I stand with every affected family. I will amplify their voices and ensure they receive every possible assistance.

NEW DELHI: The seat-sharing negotiations for upcoming assembly elections in Bihar have become more complex as two new parties - Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and Pashupati Paras's LJP faction - joined the Mahagathbandhan alliance. The situation is getting trickier as major parties are firm on their seat demands.The 243 seats will now be divided among eight parties -- Rashtriya Janata Dal, Congress, CPI, CPM, VIP, LJP (Paras) and JMM.“Two more parties are expected to be part of the INDIA bloc soon and we all have to sacrifice our share of seats to accommodate the new partners.” State Congress president Rajesh Kumar told reporters after a discussion during a key meeting of INDIA bloc leaders at the official residence of RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav.Meanwhile, Congress insist that it cannot go below the 70 seats.VIP chief Mukesh Sahani, on the other hand, has demanded “60 seats plus the post of deputy CM” while the CPI-ML is pressing for at least 40 seats, pointing to its past performance.The RJD is also unwilling to contest on fewer than 150 seats.In 2020 assembly elections, Rashtriya Janata Dal had contested on 144 seats, of which it won 75.Congress won 19 out of 70 seats.CPI-ML contested 19 seats and won 12.CPM contested 4 seats and was successful in winning 2 seats.CPI contested on 6 seats and won 2 seats.RJD's Tejashwi Yadav has already declared himself as the CM face of the opposition INDIA bloc.Addressing the rally in Ara town, the last stopover of the 'Voter Adhikar Yatra', Tejashwi questioned the Nitish Kumar government in Bihar for ""frequently copying his ideas"" and described it as a ""copycat government"".

Original CM chahiye ki duplicate?"" (Tejashwi is moving ahead while the govt is following him from behind.
