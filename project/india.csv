Interpol Blue Notice Explained: How CBI Tracks Absconding Luthra Brothers In Goa Nightclub Fire Case

NEW DELHI: Advocate Vishnu Joshi, representing a victim’s family in the Goa nightclub fire case, on Wednesday said that one of the Luthra brothers requested a Dunlop mattress during police remand.Joshi explained that the court carefully considered the brothers’ health claims before granting custody. Speaking to reporters, he said, “Today, when the Goa Police presented them in court, one accused, during their arguments, claimed he had spinal issues and other health problems. He requested that they be provided with a Dunlop mattress during their police remand. The state strongly opposed this... Their pre-medical examination showed them to be perfectly fit. ”He added that the duo had attempted to evade legal proceedings since fleeing India.“Since these people (Luthra brothers) absconded and fled the country, they have been employing tactics to somehow escape. First, they filed an anticipatory bail application on vague grounds in the Rohini Court, even though that court had no jurisdiction... But that bail application was rejected. Since then, they have been trying wherever they get a chance to obtain some kind of relaxation,” Joshi said.Joshi explained that the court carefully considered the brothers’ health claims before ordering custody.“The brothers claimed to be suffering from back pain. The court considered all submissions and directed the police to first conduct a pre-medical examination and re-examination. No medical necessity was found, following which the court, exercising its full authority, granted five days of police remand,” he said.The Luthra brothers, owners of the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub in Arpora, were remanded to five-day police custody by the Mapusa Judicial Magistrate First Class (JMFC) court.They were brought back to Goa from Thailand following their deportation and produced before the court after undergoing multiple medical examinations.After landing at Manohar International Airport, Mopa, under police escort around 10.45 am, the duo was taken to a primary health centre in Siolim and then to the District Hospital in Mapusa. The court directed fresh medical examinations before ordering the five-day custody to allow investigators to question them regarding alleged safety lapses at the club.The blaze broke out on December 6 around 11.45 pm during a crowded event at the nightclub, when electric firecrackers allegedly struck the wooden ceiling. The incident claimed the lives of 25 people, including tourists and staff, while several others were injured.Police said the brothers fled India hours after the incident on December 7, leaving for Thailand while rescue operations were under way. Goa Police launched a nationwide and international manhunt, issued a lookout circular and sought an Interpol Blue Notice.Following their detention by Thai authorities for illegal stay and the suspension of their passports, the brothers were deported to India on emergency travel documents.They landed at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport on Tuesday and were arrested by Goa Police, who obtained a 48-hour transit remand from a Delhi court to facilitate their return to Goa.They have been booked under several provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, including culpable homicide not amounting to murder and negligence. Investigators have also arrested several others linked to the nightclub’s operations and are probing allegations that the venue was operating with expired licences and without mandatory safety clearances.","Advocate Vishnu Joshi, representing victim's family, says one of the Luthra brothers requested a Dunlop mattress during police remand.

National Herald Case: Court Declines To Act On ED Chargesheet, Congress Claims Truth Has Prevailed

NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday issued a statement, a day after the Congress demanded an apology citing a government reply in Parliament that said no papers were “missing” from the Prime Ministers Museum and Library (PMML).In a series of posts on X, the Ministry of Culture rejected the opposition’s claims and defended its stand. On JN papers: Vide letter dated 29.04.2008 Shri M V Rajan, representative of Smt. Sonia Gandhi , requested that Smt. Gandhi wishes to take back all of the private family letters and notes of former PM Jawahar Lal Nehru. Accordingly, 51 cartons of Nehru Papers were sent to Smt. Sonia Gandhi in 2008. PMML has been in continuous correspondence with the office of Smt Sonia Gandhi since then for return of these papers including the letters from PMML to Smt Sonia Gandhi dated 28-01-2025 and 03-07-2025,"" it said asserting that ""Nehru Papers are not “missing” from PMML as their whereabouts are known. ""Further clarifying it added, ""These documents, relating to the first Prime Minister of India, form part of the nation’s documentary heritage and not a private property. Their custody with PMML and access to citizens and scholars for research is vital.""This comes after the Congress sought an apology from the central government and the BJP after the Centre informed Parliament that no papers related to Jawaharlal Nehru were missing from the Prime Ministers Museum and Library (PMML).The government’s reply in the Lok Sabha came against the backdrop of a controversy in which PMML had alleged that the Congress was in possession of certain papers linked to India’s first prime minister. Raising the issue, BJP MP Sambit Patra asked whether the PMML’s 2025 annual audit had found any Nehru-related papers missing. In response, Culture Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat said the annual inspection had not found any missing papers relating to Jawaharlal Nehru.","The government issued a statement a day after the Congress demanded an apology citing a government reply in Parliament.

Nashik/Mumbai: NCP minister Manikrao Kokate was divested of all his ministerial portfolios on Wednesday, hours after a court in Nashik issued warrants for his and his brother Vijay's arrest in a 1995 EWS housing quota cheating case. A day earlier, a sessions court in Nashik upheld the trial court's Feb 20 judgment, convicting and sentencing the Kokate brothers to two years of rigorous imprisonment.Sources said CM Devendra Fadnavis wrote to governor Acharya Devvrat, recommending Kokate be divested of his portfolios (sports and youth welfare and minority development and aukaf) and that the portfolios be handed over to NCP chief and deputy CM Ajit Pawar. Devvrat issued a letter approving the CM's recommendation, sources said.Kokate, who is the MLA from Sinnar, is the second NCP politician after Dhananjay Munde to have faced action since the Mahayuti alliance formed govt in Nov 2024. Munde had to step down in March after the CM called for his resignation over allegations linking his associate Valmik Karad to the murder of Massajog sarpanch Santosh Deshmukh.While Nashik commissioner of police Sandeep Karnik said they had received a non-bailable warrant against Kokate and his brother, Bombay high court has posted the hearing of the minister's application for relief on Friday.Kokate got admitted to Mumbai's Leelavati Hospital on Wednesday.All these developments came on a day when a section of NCP functionaries said Kokate should resign. Though there has so far been no statement from NCP on Kokate's fate, the opposition said merely divesting him of portfolios was not enough and he should be disqualified with immediate effect.Earlier in the day, the court of additional chief judicial magistrate Rupali C Narwadiya in Nashik rejected Kokate's application citing medical grounds to seek four days to surrender and issued the arrest warrants.",NCP minister Manikrao Kokate was divested of all his ministerial portfolios on Wednesday.
