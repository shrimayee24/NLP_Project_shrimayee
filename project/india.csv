Swearing-in of TN mantris scheduled for 6pm today: Guv office



CHENNAI: The DMK govt in Tamil Nadu got two controversial cabinet members to resign Sunday - electricity and excise minister V Senthil Balaji , whom Supreme Court gave an ultimatum last week to either exit or forfeit bail in a money laundering case, and forest minister K Ponmudy, in the dock for his purportedly disparaging remarks about women and Hindu symbols.Both ministers handed their resignation letters to governor R N Ravi, who accepted these immediately. Raj Bhavan issued a statement soon after, saying CM M K Stalin had recommended to the governor that their resignations be accepted.While Balaji was censured by SC last Wednesday, Ponmudy's remarks about women and symbols raised the hackles of Madras HC, which asked police to file an FIR against him.Housing minister S Muthusamy has been assigned the additional portfolios of excise and prohibition that Balaji used to handle. Muthusamy had been overseeing both when Balaji was sent to prison in 2023.The latter got them back on being reinstated as minister soon after coming out on bail.Transport minister S S Sivasankar has been given additional charge of the electricity department, while dairy development minister R S Rajakannappan will handle the forest portfolio. This is the third change in portfolio for Rajakannappan, as he had been shifted from the transport ministry to backward classes and then to dairy department.Former dairy development minister T Manothangaraj, who was removed from the cabinet last year, was re-inducted into the cabinet without a portfolio. Mano Thangaraj is the other minister to be brought back. Last year, minorities welfare minister S M Nasar returned to the cabinet. The swearing-in ceremony of the ministers-designate is scheduled for 6pm Monday, Raj Bhavan said. Tamil Nadu goes to polls in a year.","Electricity and excise minister V Senthil Balaji and forest minister K Ponmudy resign.

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu ministers Senthil Balaji and K Ponmudy quit the chief minister MK Stalin-led Cabinet on Sunday, reported news agency PTI, citing Raj Bhavan. Governor RN Ravi has accepted the resignation of both the leaders.SS Sivasankar has been additionally assigned the Electricity portfolio. S Muthusamy will also handle Prohibition and Excise. RS Rajakannappan will now oversee Forests and Khadi and has been appointed as the minister for forests and khadi.Additionally, the CM Stalin has recommended the induction of T Mano Thangaraj, MLA from Padmanabhapuram assembly Constituency, into the Cabinet.The swearing-in ceremony for the new minister designate is scheduled for Monday, April 28 at Raj Bhavan, Chennai.The resignation of the two ministers comes as both the DMK leaders face legal challenges, with the Supreme Court on Thursday agreeing to hear a plea in the cash-for-jobs scam , in which Senthil Balaji is one of the main accused.The plea has challenged the clubbing of four separate chargesheets - pertaining to corrupt practices in the appointments of assistant engineers, junior tradesmen, conductors and drivers - with an existing case related to the appointment of junior engineers.On Wednesday, the Madras high court noted that the remarks made by K Ponmudy against Shaivism, Vaishnavism, and women were prima facie hate speech and decided to initiate suo motu proceedings against him in that regard.""Prima facie, it was evident that his remarks demean the moral worth of sex workers, particularly women, and were calculated to subvert harmony and peace among religious groups and various sects,"" the judge said.The comments, on the face of it, were completely derogatory towards women and deliberately spewed venom and hatred on the two main sects of Hinduism, the judge added. The judge directed the initiation of proceedings as the Tamil Nadu police failed to register an FIR against the minister, as suggested by the high court last week.According to the court, as per the Supreme Court order, police are mandated to register a case against such hate speech even in the absence of a formal complaint.",Senthil Balaji and K Ponmudy quit the chief minister MK Stalin-led Cabinet.

While he was suspended days later and served a show-cause, his expulsion by BJP's disciplinary committee came on the eve of a Jaipur rally by Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge. Both Kharge and Jully would have likely seized on Ahuja's deeds and pointed to BJP's ""discriminatory practices"" at ""Save the Constitution"" rally.","Gyandev Ahuja had embarrassed the party on more than one occasion.
