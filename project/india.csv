AIADMK General Secretary Edappadi K Palaniswami (EPS) on Saturday hit back at chief minister M K Stalin , claiming the DMK chief is “daydreaming” of a comeback and “rattled” by the announcement of a renewed AIADMK-BJP alliance.“Stalin is clearly struggling and writhing in pain after Union home minister Amit Shah’s announcement,” said EPS, taking sharp aim at the chief minister for branding the alliance as corrupt and doomed to fail.Earlier in the day, Stalin had dismissed the AIADMK-BJP tie-up, saying, “It’s the same alliance Tamil Nadu voters have repeatedly rejected. Shah has just rebranded a failed formula.”In response, Palaniswami invoked a Tamil proverb: “Uppu thinnavan thanneer kudippaan” — suggesting Stalin must now face the consequences of his political missteps . “He keeps lying, slandering the AIADMK, and doing photo shoots every day,” EPS said, accusing Stalin of being more focused on optics than governance.EPS, a former CM himself, didn’t hold back. He alleged Stalin’s government was “incompetent” and relied on painting the BJP as a villain to distract from its own failures. “He’s screaming because Amit Shah spoke the truth about the DMK’s scams,” EPS added.With war drums beating louder on both sides, Tamil Nadu is clearly headed for a heated political showdown in 2026.",AIADMK General Secretary Edappadi K Palaniswami (EPS) on Saturday hit back at chief minister M K Stalin.

CM mourns ‘irreplaceable void’ in Bengal politics

From Left stalwart to Trinamool minister

NEW DELHI: Former West Bengal minister and veteran leader Abdur Razzak Mollah passed away at his ancestral home in South 24 Parganas on Friday morning.The 80-year-old Trinamool Congress leader, who had been ailing due to age-related complications, breathed his last at his residence in Bankri village in the Bhangar area, party sources confirmed.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee expressed deep grief over Mollah’s demise, recalling his contributions to Bengal’s rural and agrarian landscape.“I am saddened and shocked by the passing of my colleague, Abdur Razzak Mollah. He was my colleague in the state cabinet. I respected and honoured him,” Banerjee said on X.“His knowledge and experience in Bengal's rural life, agricultural economy and land reform were well-known. That's why, even though he once practised politics of a different ideology, it was easy and natural for him to join the 'Ma-Mati-Manush' government,” she said, calling his death an “irreplaceable void in the political life of Bengal.”Mollah served as the Minister for Land and Land Reforms during the Left Front regime and represented the Canning Purba seat from 1977 to 2011. In 2014, he was expelled from CPI(M) over “anti-party activities” and soon floated the Bharatiya Nayabichar Party (BNP).He was later expelled from the BNP as well for aligning with the ruling Trinamool Congress. Ahead of the 2016 assembly elections, Mollah officially joined TMC and won the Bhangar seat, following which he was inducted as the Minister for Food Processing.Mollah's decades-long political journey spanned ideological shifts, but his deep connect with rural Bengal and his role in land reforms remained a constant thread in his public life.He is survived by his family, and condolences have poured in from across the political spectrum.",Former West Bengal minister and veteran leader Abdur Razzak Mollah passed away at his ancestral home in South 24 Parganas on Friday morning.
