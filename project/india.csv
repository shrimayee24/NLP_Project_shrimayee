"Tamil Nadu playing fraud on system in Senthil Balaji case, says SC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tamil-nadu-playing-fraud-on-system-in-senthil-balaji-case-says-sc/articleshow/122986181.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Tuesday slammed Tamil Nadu govt for clubbing all cash-for-job scam cases, which now has over 2,000 accused, including those who gave bribe to then minister V Senthil Balaji for jobs in state transport corporation, and said this appeared to be a tactic to make the trial never-ending.""The state should be keen on prosecuting the former minister and his henchmen for the cash-for-job scam relating to employment for different categories of posts for a bribe. Now you have clubbed all cases together to include those accused of giving bribes, the poor parents who wanted a job for their children. This indicates that the state does not want the trial to ever come to an end against the minister. It is a fraud on the system,"" said a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi.Appearing for petitioner Y Balaji, senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan told the bench that the state had helped the ex-minister in every step. ""Two days after he was granted bail by the SC, he was reinstated as a minister in the present govt. He stepped down only after the SC intervention. The case was quashed after the accused and a complainant entered a compromise. It was revived after the SC intervened and said if such match fixing is allowed, then the umpire will lose his wicket,"" he said.He said there are as many as six chargesheet filed by the police and now the prosecution wants the cases to be clubbed. As the state is colluding with the accused ex-minister, it would be better if the SC orders a CBI probe and an independent prosecution of the cases relating to thousands of jobs being given against payment of bribes, the counsel said.When it was opposed by senior advocates A M Singhvi and Amit Anand Tiwari, appearing for Tamil Nadu, the SC asked for details of the brokers and middlemen who worked for the then minister during the cash-for-job scam, those who acted as a conduit, the officers who acted on behalf of the then minister, and the members of the selection committee who allowed the backdoor entries primed by bribe. It posted further hearing Wednesday.Balaji was transport minister between 2011-2016 and during that period, in connivance with his brother and personal assistant, collected large amounts by promising jobs to several persons in various positions - engineers, drivers and conductors - in the transport department.Three FIRs were filed. In the first FIR, six chargesheets have been filed naming more than 2,000 accused and citing 550 witnesses. In the chargesheet on the second FIR, 14 accused and 24 witnesses have been named. The chargesheet on the third FIR, 24 accused and 50 witnesses have been named by prosecution.","Supreme Court slams Tamil Nadu govt for clubbing all cash-for-job scam cases.

Mumbai ‘encounter specialist’ Daya Nayak promoted a day before retirement,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-encounter-specialist-daya-nayak-promoted-a-day-before-retirement/articleshow/122979696.cms,"



Mumbai: ""Encounter specialist"" police inspector Daya Nayak was promoted to the rank of assistant commissioner of police (ACP) along with three other officers just a day before his retirement.A native of Udupi, Nayak began his career as a tea stall errand boy before joining the police in 1996. His career saw turbulence when the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) initiated an inquiry against him after he opened a school in his mother's name in Karnataka. He was arrested in a disproportionate assets case but was eventually acquitted after the agency failed to produce conclusive evidence. Nayak was reinstated in the police force last year after a suspension spanning six years.Nayak was credited with eliminating over 80 gangsters from the underworld as part of the ""encounter squad"" of the city. Among his targets were gangsters Vinod Matkar, Rafik Dabba, Sadik Kalia, and three Lashkar-e-Taiba operatives. Currently attached to the Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS), Nayak played a role in cracking the case involving gelatin sticks planted outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani's Carmichael Road residence, which eventually led to the investigation into the murder of Scorpio car owner Mansukh Hiran.Along with Nayak, three other police inspectors, Jeevan Kharat, Deepak Dalvi and Pandurang Pawar from Jalgaon, were promoted to the rank of ACP.","Nayak was credited with eliminating over 80 gangsters from the underworld as part of the ""encounter squad"" of the city.

CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court has upheld the dismissal of a Haryana Police constable who sought reinstatement after prolonged absence, citing ""evil soul/black magic treatment by a tantrik"" (exorcist) in his medical records.Justice Jagmohan Bansal, while dismissing the petition filed by Arshad, observed that a disciplined force like the police ""cannot retain any indisciplined member"".The court noted that the cop remained absent from duty on 42 occasions for around 300 days out of his 12-year police job. ""If the alleged offence was his first offence, this court could consider the principle of proportionality and ask the respondents to reconsider the quantum of punishment. However, as noted above, the petitioner was a habitual offender and was punished more than once,"" the court observedArshad joined the Haryana Police as a constable on April 6, 2012. On Jan 12, 2023, he proceeded on one week's leave. When he did not rejoin duty, he was placed under suspension via an order dated Sept 1, 2023.An inquiry officer was appointed, but Arshad did not participate, leading to an ex parte finding of guilt. He was dismissed from service on June 20, 2024, a decision upheld by the appellate authority. The authority, however, noticed that some of the medical documents produced by the cop belonged to treatment of ""evil soul/black magic by a tantrik"".Challenging his dismissal, Arshad's counsel argued that his absence was not ""the gravest misconduct"" warranting dismissal under Rule 16.2 of the Punjab Police Rules, 1934, applicable in Haryana. The counsel contended that courts have often ruled that absence from duty does not constitute the ""gravest misconduct"" for dismissal.","Punjab and Haryana high court upholds dismissal of a police constable.
