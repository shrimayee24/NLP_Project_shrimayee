BHIWANDI: Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi appeared before a court here on Saturday in connection with a criminal defamation case stemming from remarks made during the 2014 Lok Sabha election campaign.Sources said Gandhi’s personal appearance was largely procedural and necessitated by the recent demise of his former surety, Shivraj Patil Chakurkar, who had stood guarantee for his bail.With the earlier surety holder passing away last month, fresh surety formalities were required to be completed before the court.The case dates back to a public rally in Sonale village in Bhiwandi taluka during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, where Gandhi allegedly stated that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ( RSS ) was responsible for the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi.Following the speech, RSS office-bearer Rajesh Kunte filed a private complaint under Section 500 of the Indian Penal Code, accusing Gandhi of defaming the organisation.Advocate Narayan Iyer, representing Gandhi, said the appearance was mandated due to the submission of a new surety. “Gandhi was required to be present as a new surety has been furnished following the demise of his earlier surety. The hearing was primarily procedural,” Iyer told TOI.On Gandhi’s behalf, Maharashtra Congress president Harshwardhan Sapkal was presented as the new surety before the court.Iyer said that after Sapkal’s surety was submitted, Gandhi signed the bond.Iyer added that the matter has reached an advanced stage. “The chief examination and cross-examination of the complainant, Rajesh Kunte, have been concluded. The trial is progressing,” he said.In view of Gandhi’s visit, Thane Police had deployed additional personnel around the court premises to manage crowds and ensure law and order.",The case dates back to a public rally in Sonale village in Bhiwandi taluka during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.

Mumbai: A tussle is brewing within the MVA over the selection of a candidate for the lone Rajya Sabha seat which the alliance can win in the upcoming RS polls. While Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut had revealed that NCP (SP) chief Sharad Pawar was keen on contesting, Aaditya Thackeray claimed the seat for the UBT Sena. Now the Congress has said that either one Rajya Sabha or MLC seat should come to it.""Since we have the second highest number of MLAs in the alliance, the Congress should get either a Rajya Sabha or MLC seat,"" said Congress spokesperson Atul Londhe on Friday.Sanjay Raut struck a conciliatory note on Friday, saying three parties in the alliance will sit together and take a decision on the candidate. ""We have enough numbers for one Rajya Sabha seat. The three parties will sit down and decide who is the best candidate for the interests and identity of Maharashtra. The decision will be taken unanimously,"" Raut said. The election is slated for March 16.When asked about NCP (SP) chief Sharad Pawar's possible candidature since his term is ending, Raut said, ""Sharad Pawar is a big leader of this country."" He added, ""Each party feels it is an important constituent and will seek opportunities.But finally, there is consensus.""Raut said it was important to send a Marathi-speaking candidate to the Rajya Sabha. ""We need to send a Marathi-speaking candidate to the Rajya Sabha who will raise issues in the interest of Maharashtra,"" he said.The question of a joint candidate within the MVA assumes significance in view of the speculation on talks of a merger between the NCP (SP), which is part of the MVA, and the NCP led by the late Ajit Pawar which is part of the ruling Mahayuti alliance. The MVA needs 37 votes to win a Rajya Sabha seat. It has 47 MLAs. The Sena (UBT) has the highest number at 20, followed by the Congress with 16 and the NCP (SP) with 10.","The MVA needs 37 votes to win a Rajya Sabha seat. It has 47 MLAs.

'Inform parents': Gujarat may tweak marriage norms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/inform-parents-gujarat-may-tweak-marriage-norms/articleshow/128627801.cms,"Gujarat deputy CM Harsh Sanghavi, who has itnroduced the proposal

GANDHINAGAR: The BJP govt in Gujarat has proposed 'anti-love jihad' amendments to marriage registration rules that would require couples to inform their parents before registering their union - a move welcomed by AAP, met with silence by the Congress and flagged by legal experts as a potential constitutional violation.Under the draft rules introduced in the assembly Friday, couples seeking to register their marriage will have to submit an undertaking stating whether they have informed their parents. The assistant registrar will notify the parents of both bride and groom electronically, including over WhatsApp, or through physical communication.Registration will be granted within 30 days after verification, with all submitted details uploaded to a govt portal.Deputy CM Harsh Sanghavi, who introduced the proposed changes, said the govt had nothing against ""love marriage"" but couldn't allow deception in the name of mutual consent. ""Innocent girls are being trapped and such practices are spreading like termites in society. Salim masquerading as Suresh will not be allowed,"" he said.Citing instances from Panchmahal district, Sanghavi said investigations were ordered after nikaah certificates were allegedly issued in villages where there was no mosque or even a single Muslim family.In villages such as Kankodakui and Nathkuva, hundreds of such certificates were allegedly issued by talati-cum-mantris (village panchayat secretaries), Sanghavi said.In the assembly, AAP legislator Hemant Ahir, who had moved a private member's bill on similar lines earlier in the week, congratulated the govt on tabling the proposed amendments. ""Changes in the rules were the need of the hour. There were several loopholes in the rules,"" he said.BJP MLA Lavingji Thakor, a strong proponent of stricter norms, said the move would benefit families of all communities. Congress stayed mum.Several community organisations, including those representing the Patidar and Kshatriya Thakor groups, have long pressed for mandatory parental involvement in love marriages. Over the past three months, as many as 30 meetings were held between the state govt and representatives of various organisations to finalise the changes.Legal experts said the proposal might not stand judicial scrutiny. ""This infringes upon the fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution,"" said advocate Mahesh Baria. Fellow advocate Nilesh Bhavsar said while the govt had described the measure as mere intimation, parental objections could potentially influence registration decisions, leading to litigation.","BJP govt in Gujarat has proposed 'anti-love jihad' amendments to marriage registration rules.

Mamata Banerjee vs Election Commission: Supreme Court Orders Judicial Oversight in Bengal SIR

TMC: SC order on SIR a no-trust vote against EC

New Delhi: In an unprecedented decision, the Supreme Court on Friday used its ""extraordinary powers"" to deploy judicial officers in West Bengal to decide claims for inclusion in voter list and speed up the completion of Special Intensive Revision of electoral rolls. The court emphasised that CM Mamata Banerjee should be aware of the consequences if the revision exercise is not concluded.The court explained that the unprecedented judicial intervention under Article 142 of the Constitution was necessitated by the ""extraordinary situation"" that has arisen in Bengal due to trust deficit and non-cooperation between EC and the Bengal govt.A bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi also, despite objections by the TMC-led govt, allowed the Election Commission (EC) to publish the revised electoral roll - 95% of the total list - on Feb 28, the deadline for publication of the final voter list, while the remaining inclusion claims are still being decided. The bench also did not agree with the contention of the state govt that electoral registration officers (EROs), and not the judicial officers, should have the final say in deciding claims of inclusion in the voter list.Trinamool Congress on Friday described Supreme Court's order supplanting judicial officers over EC-appointed officers to hear SIR's logical discrepancy cases as a ""no-trust vote against the EC"".In a post on X, the party said: ""This constitutes a scathing indictment of a constitutional body that has failed in the faithful discharge of its duties. It is also a powerful vindication of our principled fight to safeguard the rights of the people and uphold the integrity of the democratic process.""TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh said: ""Even the topmost court of the land appears convinced that the poll body is not neutral, nor competent, after saddling people with unjustifiable hearing notices.""","Supreme Court deploys judicial officers in West Bengal to decide claims for inclusion in voter list.

KOLKATA: Tasked with adjudicating about 45 lakh disputed SIR cases, Calcutta High Court administration on Saturday cancelled the leaves of all senior district judges till March 9. Around 23 district judges and 150 senior judges will dispose of the cases under CCTV coverage. The judges are expected to begin work on Monday.Late evening, the high court registrar general provided Bengal govt with an initial district-wise list of 95 judges for SIR work. Most of the judges have been deputed in North and South 24 Parganas (13 each) and Murshidabad (8), given the high SIR pendency in these districts.The HC order cancelling leaves except in medical emergency, unprecedented in recent times, came after Chief Justice Sujoy Paul chaired a meeting with senior state and Election Commission officials on Supreme Court’s directive. The meeting was attended by CEO Manoj Agarwal, chief secretary Nandini Chakravorty, DGP Peeyush Pandey, Kolkata Police commissioner Supratim Sarkar, Vijay Pandey (EC’s DG of Law), registrar general of Calcutta HC, advocate general and additional solicitor general.CEO Agarwal said, “Primarily, 45 lakh disputed cases have been identified by the micro-observers. However, this figure may change as the portal for scrutiny of documents and disposal will close Saturday midnight.We will compile district and assembly constituency-wise cases and submit these to the HC before Sunday noon.”EC sources said, in the bulk of these cases, the microobservers have flagged discrepancies such as uploading of blank or illegible pages, absence of family relationship documents and conflicting dates of birth across different documents, among others.Agarwal said the EC has requested one judicial officer per assembly constituency. “They will start reaching the districts Sunday and are expected to begin work Monday,” he said and added that the Commission will stick to its Feb 28 deadline of publishing the first voters’ list. “All cases cleared by Feb 26 or 27 will be included in the list to be published on Feb 28. The remaining cleared cases will be included in a supplementary list,” he said.The EC is developing a simple portal for the judicial officers and creating login IDs for them. Micro-observers and state govt officers already deputed with the EC will assist the judges. CCTVs will be installed both inside and outside the rooms where the judicial officers will work.According to sources, at Saturday’s meeting with the Chief Justice, state and EC officials differed over which former chief justices or judges will oversee the judicial officers.The Commission objected to some names in the state’s list of seven former justices, stating that a few of them have held or are currently holding positions in different state panels or other govt departments after retirement.On Friday, the Supreme Court, in an “extraordinary” order had directed that “serving judicial officers, along with some former judicial officers of impeccable integrity in the rank of district judges/ additional district judges, can be requested to revisit and dispose of the pending claims under the category of ‘logical discrepancy/unmapped category’ in each district.”",Around 23 district judges and 150 senior judges will dispose of the cases under CCTV coverage.
