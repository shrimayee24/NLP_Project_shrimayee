NEW DELHI: At least 10 children lost their lives in a fire that broke out in the children's ward of a medical college in Uttar Pradesh's Jhansi district, officials said. Sixteen others sustained injuries and are currently in critical condition.According to hospital officials, there were around 54 infants admitted to the NICU ward. ""This is a very sad and unfortunate incident. 10 newborns died in the fire, and around 35 newborns were rescued. Doctors are giving the best possible treatment to the injured newborns. Government is in touch with medical college doctors,"" BJP MLA Rajeev Singh Parichha said.Jhansi district magistrate (DM) Avinash Kumar informed reporters that the fire started around 10:45 pm on Friday in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of Maharani Laxmi Bai Medical College . As per the officials, the prima facie cause of the fire is said to be due to a short circuit.Children in the outer section of the NICU, along with some from the inner section, were successfully rescued.""Prima facie there is information of the death of 10 children,"" the DM said.Uttar Pradesh government announced that a multi-level investigation will be carried out into the fire at Medical College.Speaking to reporters on Saturday, UP deputy CM Brajesh Pathak promised strict action against those found responsible and assured the state government’s support to the families of the deceased infants.""The death of the newborns is very unfortunate. Along with the family members, we are trying to identify the bodies of newborns. The first probe will be done at the administrative level which will be done by the health department, the second probe will be conducted by the Police administration...fire department team will also be a part of it, third, instructions have been given for the magisterial probe as well. The cause of the fire will be probed,"" Pathak said.""If any lapses are found, those who would be responsible, strict action will be taken against them and no one will be spared. The government is with the family members of the children,"" he added.Following the tragic fire, the UP CM announced financial support from the chief minister's Relief Fund. ""On the instructions of the chief minister, assistance of Rs 5 lakh each is being provided to the parents of the newborn babies who died in the incident and Rs 50,000 each to the families of the injured from the chief minister's Relief Fund.

The fire accident at Jhansi Medical College in Uttar Pradesh is heart-wrenching. My deepest condolences to those who lost their innocent children in this. I pray to God to give them the strength to bear this immense loss.""""The local administration, under the supervision of the state government, is making every possible effort for relief and rescue,"" he added.Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also took cognisance of the incident and instructed district officials to ensure proper treatment for the injured. ""The death of children in an accident that took place in the NICU of the medical college located in Jhansi district is extremely sad and heartbreaking. District administration and concerned officials have been instructed to conduct relief and rescue operations on a war footing,"" he posted in Hindi on X.Commenting on the incident, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav said, ""The news of 10 children dying and many children getting injured due to fire in Jhansi Medical College is extremely sad and worrying. Heartfelt condolences to everyone.""He added, ""The fire is reported to have been caused by an 'oxygen concentrator'. This is clearly a case of negligence by medical management and administration or the use of poor-quality oxygen concentrators. All responsible individuals should face punitive action. The chief minister should focus on the deterioration of health and medical services instead of election campaigning and making false claims of everything being fine.""","Fire broke out in the children's ward of a medical college in Uttar Pradesh's Jhansi district. 10 newborns died in the fire, and around 35 newborns were rescued.

'Batenge to katenge': Has Yogi Adityanath's slogan divided Maharashtra's Mahayuti?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/batenge-to-katenge-has-yogi-adityanaths-slogan-divided-maharashtras-mahayuti/articleshow/115337838.cms,"Left to Right: Devendra Fadnavis, UP CM Yogi Adityanath and Ajit Pawar

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Friday strongly endorsed Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath 's war cry for unity ""batenge ko katenge"" and countered his ally NCP's Ajit Pawar , who has opposed the slogan, while sending out a clear message to some state BJP leaders who have spoken against the UP CM's poll pitch. Interestingly, even Prime Minister Narendra Modi has refrained from using Yogi's slogan in his election rallies and has instead preferred the pitch ""Ek hain to safe hain"" to drive home the importance of unity.Fadnavis on Friday reacted sharply to Ajit Pawar's remarks and referred to his counterpart's past political association to brush aside his objections. ""For decades, Ajit Pawar has stayed with such ideologies which are anti-Hindu. There is no real secularism amongst those who call themselves as secularists. He has stayed with people for whom opposing Hindutva is secularism. There is no real secularism among those who call themselves secular,"" Fadnavis said in a hard-hitting counter to his ally.""It will take some time for him to understand the mood of the public. These people either did not understand the sentiments of the public or did not understand the statement or they probably wanted to say something else,"" he said.""I don't see anything wrong in Yogi ji's slogan. Look at the history of this country. Jab jab bate hai tab gulam bane hai. Whenever this country was divided into castes, into states, divided into communities society, we became slaves. The country was also divided, and so were the people. That's why if we divide, we will cut. This is the history of this country,"" Fadnavis added.Ajit Pawar had called Yogi's ""batenge to katenge"" slogan inappropriate even as the NCP leader supported PM Modi's unity pitch.""The remark 'batenge to katenge' is inappropriate. People's thinking in UP, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh is different, but such statements don't work here. Using such words holds no significance in Maharashtra, in my opinion. Maharashtra is the state of Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj, Mahatma Jyotirao Phule and Shivaji Maharaj. People of Maharashtra are different, and they think differently. If anyone leaves the ideology of Shahu, Shivaji, Phule and Ambedkar, then Maharashtra will not spare them,"" the NCP leader had said.""There is nothing wrong with 'ek hain to safe hain' slogan. I don't see any issue here. If we stay together, everyone will prosper,"" he had added.It was not just Ajit Pawar who objected to Yogi's war cry. At least two BJP leaders of Maharashtra - Pankaja Munde and Ashok Chavan - also did not endorse the UP CM's poll pitch. Munde had earlier this week said there was no need for a slogan such as ""batenge to katenge"" in Maharashtra.""Frankly speaking, my politics is different. I won't support it just because I belong to the BJP. My belief is we should work on development. There is no need for such an issue in Maharashtra,"" Pankaja had told reporters on Wednesday.BJP MP and former Maharashtra chief minister Ashok Chavan has called the slogan ""batenge to katenge"" not in good taste and irrelevant.""There is no relevance of this (slogan). Slogans are given at election time. This particular slogan is not in good taste and I don't think people will appreciate it. Personally speaking, I am not in favour of such slogans,"" Chavan had said.""Every political functionary has to take a decision after a lot of thinking. We also have to see that nobody's sentiments are hurt,"" the BJP leader added.Adityanath had used the slogan 'batenge to katenge, ek rahenge to nek rahenge' for the first time in August to call for unity as Hindus were targeted in Bangladesh after the fall of Sheikh Hasina-led government.“Nothing can be above the nation. And the nation will be empowered only when we are united. 'Batenge to Katenge'. You are seeing what is happening in Bangladesh. Those mistakes should not be repeated here... 'Batenge to Katenge, Ek Rahenge to Nek Rahenge,” the UP chief minister had said at a public meeting.The Uttar Pradesh chief minister and several other BJP leaders have repeated the slogan frequently during their campaign trail in both Maharashtra and Jharkhand. ""If we are divided, then Ganapati pooja would be attacked, lands would be grabbed under Land Jihad, safety of daughters would be in danger... There is no Love Jihad or Land Jihad in UP today. It was already announced that if anyone hampers the security of our daughters, grabbed the land of government and the poor, then 'Yamraj' would be ready to cut their ticket,"" Adityanath said at a poll rally in Amravati.The strong retort by Fadnavis today targets not just the opposition but also sends a clear message to NCP, which has had an uneasy existence in the Mahayuti after its failure in the Lok Sabha elections. In the Lok Sabha elections earlier this year, the Mahayuti could win only 17 out of 48 seats. Ajit Pawar's NCP was the worst performer winning only 1 out of the 4 seats it contested.After the results, the RSS had openly criticised the BJP for joining hands with Ajit Pawar and had attributed this one ""wrong move"" for NDA's drubbing in Lok Sabha elections. An article in ""Organiser"" magazine, which is linked to the RSS, had slammed BJP's move and called it ""unnecessary politicking."" It said the induction of Ajit Pawar's NCP into NDA had reduced the brand value of BJP.""Maharashtra is a prime example of unnecessary politicking and avoidable manipulations. NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar joined BJP though BJP and split SS (Shiv Sena) had a comfortable majority. Sharad Pawar would have faded away in two-three years as NCP would have lost energy with infighting between cousins,"" RSS lifelong member Ratan Sharda had said in the article.""Why was this ill-advised step taken? BJP supporters were hurt because they had fought against this Congress ideology for years and were persecuted. In a single stroke, BJP reduced its brand value. After years of struggle to become numero uno in Maharashtra, it became just another political party without any difference,"" he added.It is in this light that the rather strong response of Fadnavis against Ajit Pawar on the issue of Yogi's slogan may worry the NCP leadership. In politics, there are no permanent friends or foes. But it is generally unusual for leaders to remind allies of their past to target them when they are on the same side of the divide. More so, Fadnavis reaction could well be a planned warning to the ally or maybe the two leaders are just playing to their galleries and consolidating their supporters.","Devendra Fadnavis on Friday strongly endorsed Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath's war cry for unity ""batenge ko katenge"" He countered his ally NCP's Ajit Pawar, who has opposed the slogan. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has refrained from using Yogi's slogan in his election rallies.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115340145,imgsize-67532,width-400,resizemode-4/115340145.jpg"

According to reports, a youth had joined the ""pangat (guests sitting and dining on the ground in a row)"". He grew suspicious after he was served too much gravy in his bowl. He dipped a finger into his bowl and couldn't find a single mutton piece. As tempers flew, he asked the person serving the food about it and, on not receiving a satisfactory response, hurled abuse at him and slapped him.This led to a clash between the youth's companions and the caterer, forcing other guests to leave the feast. Some senior cadres and locals intervened to pacify both parties.Later, when reporters contacted the MP at a public meeting of UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath in the district's Majhawan area on Friday to enquire about the party being held despite the model code of conduct being in place, Bind refused to comment. Umashankar Bind, who looks after the MP's office, said, ""As maximum invitees had consumed food, preparations were being made to wind up the feast after 8.30pm. In the meantime, some youths who had been consuming liquor at a country liquor shop entered the venue, which was restricted to limited invitees.""The same youth caused disturbance and fled the scene, he added. According to him, the whereabouts of those youths could not be ascertained from people present at the office.Bind, who won Majhwan assembly seat in the 2022 assembly elections on a Nishad Party ticket, made it to the Lok Sabha by winning Bhadohi as a BJP candidate in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, necessitating a bypoll.BJP has fielded Suchismita Maurya, who had won the 2017 assembly election from there, in the bypoll.","A feast hosted by BJP's Bhadohi MP Vinod Kumar Bind turned into a battleground.

BJP condemns Kanhaiya's remarks

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Kanhaiya Kumar has ignited a political storm with his controversial comments targeting Maharashtra's deputy chief minister, Devendra Fadnavis , and his wife, Amruta. The remarks, made during a rally in Nagpur on Wednesday, have drawn sharp condemnation from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Kanhaiya, while addressing the crowd, took aim at Fadnavis' recent comments referring to the upcoming elections as a ""Dharamyudh"", suggesting that the protection of religion should be a collective effort. He said that the job of ""saving religion"" should not be reduced to political rhetoric while the Deputy CM’s wife engages in ""making Instagram reels.""""Deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said that this is a 'Dharamyudh'. This is a good thing. It is our Dharam to protect the democracy and the constitution for which I am standing and giving a speech today. Whichever leader talks about saving religion, you have to ask only one thing to that leader who is giving you speech about saving religion that will your son or daughter join us in this fight to save religion?"" he questioned.""Will this happen that the responsibility of saving the religion will be ours and your children will study in Oxford Cambridge universities. If we want to save religion, let us save it together. It can't be like we save religion and the deputy chief minister's wife makes reels on Instagram. It can't be like that. Everyone will save the religion together,"" Kanhaiya added.The remarks were a direct response to Fadnavis' recent statement during his campaign for Mahayuti candidates, where he had called for a ""Dharma-Yuddha"" to counter what he described as ""vote-jihad"" in the state.The BJP was quick to condemn Kanhaiya Kumar’s comments, with party spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla leading the charge. Poonawalla labelled Kanhaiya as a ""Naxali Afzal Guru supporter"" and accused him of disrespecting Marathi women by targeting""How dare you insult a daughter of Maharashtra, Kanhaiya Kumar? Your words are an insult to every Marathi woman,"" Poonawalla wrote on social media platform X (formerly Twitter). ""Amruta Fadnavis is a proud daughter of Maharashtra, and those who use such derogatory language will face the consequences from the people of Maharashtra.""Poonawalla's statement referred to Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Arvind Sawant's statement who in late October faced backlash for calling Shiv Sena candidate Shaina NC ""imported maal"" during the Maharashtra Assembly election campaign. In his defence, Sawant denied mentioning Shaina’s name, clarifying, ""I only said that someone who is an outsider will not be able to work here."" He emphasised respect for Shaina, calling her a friend.The Maharashtra assembly elections are set for November 20, with the counting of votes scheduled for November 23. In the 2019 state elections, the BJP secured 105 seats, while the Shiv Sena won 56, and Congress claimed 44 seats, out of 288. However, in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the MVA coalition saw a strong showing, winning 30 of the 48 available seats, while the Mahayuti could only secure 17.","Congress leader Kanhaiya Kumar has ignited a political storm with his controversial comments targeting Maharashtra's deputy chief minister, Devendra Fadnavis.

AGRA: A bride walked out of her wedding after the groom refused to perform the main rituals unless his demand for Rs 30 lakh dowry was met at the venue. Ravi Kumar, a police constable posted in Agra, was arrested after a case against him was filed by the bride’s father, a sub-inspector posted in Ghaziabad.The dowry demand was allegedly made shortly after the groom’s party arrived and the garland exchange (varmala) ritual was performed. When the bride’s family expressed their inability to give such a huge amount, an argument ensued between the two parties.Realising that her knight in shining armour wasn’t what he had initially shown her to be, the bride refused to marry him, terming his actions unacceptable. Khandauli SHO Rakesh Singh Chauhan said a case under BNS section 352 (intention insult) and sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act was registered against Ravi Kumar.“The groom was arrested, but released on bail later after being served a notice,” said SHO Chauhan.A member from bride’s side said, “Her father had already spent lakhs of rupees on the wedding. Also, household goods and other appliances worth several lakhs of rupees were given. Still, the groom demanded Rs 30 lakh in cash on the wedding night.”","Ravi Kumar, a police constable posted in Agra, was arrested after a case against him was filed by the bride's father.

NEW DELHI: Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu-led Congress government of Himachal Pradesh has rushed to Supreme Court seeking to validate appointment of six parliamentary secretaries based on a 2006 state law that was quashed by high court two days ago for being illegal and unconstitutional.The Sukhu government, facing internal dissension for some time which was reflected in the loss of Congress candidate A M Singhvi after a tie with the BJP candidate in Rajya Sabha election in February, revealed its real apprehension.""The legal consequence would be that six parliamentary secretaries, who are also MLAs, are likely to face disqualification under Article 192 of the Constitution as the protection granted to them from the office of profit norms has been taken away, without adjudication, causing political instability,"" the state government said.It questioned the correctness of HC's November 13 judgment and sought a stay.

The investigator sought 14-day custodial interrogation of Padheria, arguing that he is a habitual offender.The remand application mentioned the 2017 FIR registered against him with Bavla police, accusing him of cheating, criminal conspiracy and violation of various sections of the Information Technology Act.It was submitted that because Padheria had worked with the police department for 15 years, he had knowledge of departmental procedures and did not cooperate with the investigation.The prosecutor submitted that the murder weapon and the clothes he was wearing during the crime need to be recovered. Padheria has admitted to possessing one knife, but he is silent about the other, and therefore custodial interrogation is required, the court was told. They also aim to trace his movements by collecting CCTV footage and identify anyone who helped him while he was on the run.Opposing the remand plea, Padheria's counsel argued that the accused was in police custody for two days and the investigators had enough time to interrogate him. The crime took place in a fit of rage and was not a pre-planned act. However, the prosecutor clarified that Padheria had been in custody for only 24 hours after his arrest as he was handed over to Bhopal police by the crime branch on Thursday.","Head constable Virendrasinh Padheria sent to 10-day police remand in connection with the killing of a second-year MICA student, Priyanshu Jain, on November 10. The prosecution submitted that Paderia is a habitual offender and cited a criminal case registered against him in 2017.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115345405,imgsize-1427609,width-400,resizemode-4/115345405.jpg"

He, however, added that Adani hosted the dinner but “was not participating in the political discussions.”Pawar Senior made these remarks in an interview with The News Minute-Newslaundry . He said that apart from him, those present were Adani, Amit Shah , and Ajit Pawar. The power-sharing talks took place before Ajit Pawar’s early morning swearing-in as deputy chief minister, with Devendra Fadnavis as CM, to form a govt that lasted barely 80 hours.Pawar Senior was quoted by the news portal as saying that his NCP colleagues, many of whom faced cases from Central agencies, told him they had been assured that if they joined hands with BJP, the cases would go away. Pawar, according to the report, said he pushed back as he was not convinced that BJP would keep its promise, but his colleagues said “why not hear it from the horse’s mouth” and that was how he found himself at a dinner at Adani’s residence, with Amit Shah present.Referring to the meeting, Ajit Pawar had said, “It has been five years, everyone knows where the meeting happened, it was in Delhi at a businessman’s house, everyone knows it. Yes, there were five meetings… Amit Shah was there, Gautam Adani was there, Praful Patel was there, Devendra Fadnavis was there, Ajit Pawar was there, Pawar Saheb was there… All were there... Everything was decided.” He had further said, “Blame for it has fallen on me, and I have taken it. I took blame and made others safe.”When he was asked why Pawar Senior had later hesitated and not gone with BJP, Ajit had said he didn’t know. “Pawar Saheb is a leader whose mind no one in the world can read. Not even our aunty (Sharad Pawar’s wife Pratibha) or our Supriya (Sule),” he had said.Meanwhile, Sharad Pawar on Thursday visited Chinchwad assembly constituency in Pune district to campaign for his party’s candidate, Rahul Kalate, who is contesting against BJP’s Shankar Jagtap in the Maharashtra elections on Nov 20.

The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections , which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases. The results will be declared on November 23, along with Maharashtra.In the Tribal-dominated state, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and CM Hemant's Soren Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) are in a direct fight, while the Congress party and Lalu Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) are in alliance with the JMM.The JMM-Congress-RJD alliance are also reportedly seeking to deal with Left parties, Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party and other tribal outfits that have been contesting the elections in the state as independent entities and make efforts to field candidates against the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) on all 81 seats collectively.In the last assembly polls in 2019, the JMM-Congress-RJD alliance won a comfortable majority of 47 seats in a House of 81.The BJP slipped to 25 seats from 37 it held in 2014. The poor performance was perceived to be the outcome of its decision to contest alone backfiring. The party did not foster an alliance with the Ajsu in the 2019 polls when Raghubar Das, currently the Odisha governor, was serving the state as CM.In this year's Lok Sabha polls in Jharkhand, the BJP-led NDA secured nine out of the 14 seats, with the BJP winning eight and its alliance partner, the Ajsu (All Jharkhand Students Union) Party, retaining its single seat.On the other hand, the opposition India bloc improved its tally, increasing its seat count from two in 2019 to five in the parliamentary polls.BJP and JMM have spruced up their pace of campaigning from the ground zero to social media. BJP and JMM leaders are actively rebutting and challenging each other on a range of issues, including illegal immigration, youth welfare, employment and housing.INDIA bloc parties in Jharkhand slammed the EC for holding assembly elections in the state along with that of Maharashtra but claimed that they were ready to slug it out with BJP-led NDA, which has welcomed the announcement of poll dates.JMM, Congress, and CPI (ML-L) said the announcement showed that EC was in a hurry to conduct elections though the assembly tenure was due to end in January next year.Also, both the INDIA bloc and BJP-led NDA are expected to get into huddles to discuss the modalities of seat-sharing which is going to be a challenge for both the competing teams.","The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections, which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra. Elections in Maharashtra will be held in single phase on November 20. The counting of votes will be on November 23.Maharashtra is gearing up for elections as the two major political alliances—the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) and the Mahayuti—prepare to face each other for the first time in a Vidhan Sabha election.The Maha Vikas Aghadi, comprise of the Congress, the Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray), and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) under Sharad Pawar, will go head-to-head with the Mahayuti , which includes the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Shiv Sena faction led by Eknath Shinde, and the NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar. This will be the first electoral contest between these two alliances since the splits within the Shiv Sena and NCP.The MVA is hopeful of replicating its recent Lok Sabha success, while the Mahayuti aims to retain power by leveraging its populist schemes targeted at women and youth. Both alliances have set their sights on winning the state.Narayan Rane, a former Union Minister and the victor in the Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg Lok Sabha constituency, is poised to be a key figure for the BJP in the Konkan region during the forthcoming elections. Meanwhile, two constituencies are expected to be critical battlegrounds: chief minister Eknath Shinde's Kopri-Pachpakdi seat in Thane City and Worli in Mumbai, where Aaditya Thackeray, a leader of the Shiv Sena (UBT), is seeking reelection.In the last Vidhan Sabha elections in 2019, the BJP secured 26.1% of the votes, the Congress 16.1%, the NCP 16.9%, and the Shiv Sena 16.6%. The BJP and the Shiv Sena (then united) formed the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which secured a majority. However, the coalition soon crumbled due to disagreements over government formation, plunging the state into a political crisis.After no party could establish a government, Maharashtra was placed under President's rule. Devendra Fadnavis was briefly sworn in as chief minister, with Ajit Pawar as deputy chief minister. However, both resigned just days later before a scheduled floor test.By November 28, 2019, a new coalition emerged, with the Shiv Sena (Uddhav faction), NCP (Sharad Pawar faction), and Congress forming the Maha Vikas Aghadi government, led by Uddhav Thackeray as chief minister.The state's politics took another turn in June, 2022, when Uddhav Thackeray resigned following a rebellion within the Shiv Sena, led by Eknath Shinde, who then allied with the BJP. Eknath Shinde assumed the role of chief minister, with Devendra Fadnavis returning as deputy chief minister.",The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra. Elections in Maharashtra will be held in single phase on November 20. The counting of votes will be on November 23.
