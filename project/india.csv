NEW DELHI: The Congress on Monday came down heavily on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over the removal of the iconic 1971 war ""surrender"" painting from the Army headquarters in New Delhi with a new artwork, calling it part of a broader effort to alter India’s history.Congress MP Manickam Tagore submitted an adjournment motion notice in the Lok Sabha to address the removal of a 1971 war photograph from the Army Headquarters in New Delhi and its repercussions.In his notice to speaker Om Birla, Tagore expressed concern over the removal of the photograph, which marks the historic surrender of Pakistani forces in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on December 16, 1971. He called the act not only troubling but a direct insult to the historical significance of the event, urging the central government to ""immediately"" return the photograph to its original location.""This action is part of a disturbing trend observed in recent years, where similar efforts to alter or erase India's original history have been reported across various ministries, monuments, and defense establishments. These incidents appear to be part of a wider push by the PM Modi government to erase or reframe historical events that do not align with certain narratives,"" the Congress MP said.Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also hit out at the government, saying, ""A picture has been taken down from the headquarters of the Army in which the Pakistani Army is surrendering in front of the Indian Army .""A release from the Indian Army, featuring Army chief general Upendra Dwivedi welcoming his visiting Nepalese counterpart with the new painting in the background, was the first sign that the old photograph had been removed.Meanwhile, as the controversy grew over the removal of the iconic painting, the Indian Army informed on Monday that it has been installed ""to its most befitting place,"" at the Manekshaw Centre in New Delhi.""On the occasion of Vijay Diwas , General Upendra Dwivedi COAS, along with the President of Army Wives Welfare Association (AWWA), Sunita Dwivedi, installed the iconic 1971 surrender painting to its most befitting place, The Manekshaw Centre, named after the Architect and the Hero of 1971 War, Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw,"" Indian Army said in a post on X.Meanwhile, BJP MP Manoj Tiwari replied to Congress's criticism, saying, ""(We don't remove photographs, we have in fact put up new photographs of Rajiv Gandhi, Indira Gandhi, Manmohan Singh, PV Narasimha Rao in Prime Minister's Museum.The historic picture at the center of the row depicted Pakistan's Lt General A A K Niazi signing the Instrument of Surrender in 1971, alongside India’s Lt General Jagjit Singh Aurora . It was prominently displayed in the Army Chief’s annexe, where he met important visitors. The painting, symbolizing one of India’s greatest military victories, served as the backdrop for many photos taken with foreign dignitaries and others.The new artwork, however, named '– Field of Deeds', features images of Chanakya, Garuda, and Krishna driving Arjuna’s chariot from the Mahabharata alongside tanks, helicopters, and boats, showing India's military might.December 16, 1971, marks the day Pakistan signed the Instrument of Surrender in Dhaka after a 13-day war with India.

I say this with full responsibility, EVM cannot be hacked. EVM cannot be tampered with. There is a simple reason for this. First, it is a standalone machine ... no connection with any network or outer gadget. So, hacking or tampering is not possible. Second, the chip used in it is one-time programmable, so there cannot be any reprogramming Maharashtra additional chief electoral officer Kiran Kulkarni

NEW DELHI: After Rahul vs Mamata leadership tussle, EVMs have become the latest flashpoint between INDIA (Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance)bloc partners. A day after National Conference leader Omar Abdullah openly ridiculed Congress's stand with his remarks ""you can't accept election results when you win, and blame EVMs when you lose"" echoing BJP's line of attack, it was the turn of Trinamool Congress to sermon the grand old party.""The people who raise questions on EVM, if they have anything then they should go and show a demo to the Election Commission. If work is done properly at the time of EVM randomisation and the people who work on the booth check during mock polls and counting, then I don't think there is any substance in this allegation,"" Trinamool Congress MP and party national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee said on Monday.""If still someone feels that EVMs can be hacked, then they should meet the Election Commission and show how EVMs can be hacked ... Nothing can be done by just making random statements,"" the TMC MP added.The Congress reacted sharply to Omar Abdullah's remarks and reminded the J&K chief minister that it was not alone in questioning the use of EVMs.Urging Omar Abdullah to ""verify facts"", Congress leader Manickam Tagore questioned Omar Abdullah's swipe, saying, ""Why this approach to our partners after being CM?"" ""It’s the Samajwadi Party , NCP, and Shiv Sena UBT that have spoken against EVMs. Please check your facts,"" Tagore said on X . ""The Congress CWC resolution clearly addresses the ECI only. Why this approach to our partners after being CM?"" he added.Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav is a vocal critic of EVMs and is on record to state in Parliament that even if his party wins all 80 Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh he will still demand scrapping the use of EVMs.""I did not trust EVMs yesterday, I don't trust EVMs today and I will not trust EVMs even if I win all 80 seats in UP. I will use the victory attained by EVMs to remove the EVM. The doubts over the use EVMs has not died and we Samajwadis will not sit quiet till use of EVMs is stopped,"" Akhilesh had said in Lok Sabha.The Shiv Sena (UBT) of Uddhav Thackeray has also been vocal against the use of EVMs. After the party's humiliating show in the just-concluded Maharashtra assembly elections, Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut put a post on his X handle along with a poster, which said, ""Jiska EVM, uski democracy"", which means democracy belongs to those who control Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs).""In a dig at the BJP, which along with its partners Shiv Sena and NCP swept the Maha polls, Sanjay Raut had said the ruling Mahayuti should take out a procession of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and take the decision to construct an EVM temple.""During the first cabinet meeting, they should announce the construction of an EVM temple in front of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) headquarters in Nagpur,"" Raut had said last week.Maharashtra NCP (Sharad Pawar faction) chief Jayant Patil had also raised concerns about the use of EVMs in the Maharashtra assembly elections, questioning the rise in voting numbers after 5 pm.""Even though our numbers are less, we will continue to raise questions. In the recent elections, voting increased in Maharashtra after 5 pm. This is a matter of concern. While the EVM is a simple calculator, it increases the vote count automatically at night. This is a critical issue that must be addressed. The Election Commission of India appears to be hiding something,"" Patil had said.Demanding the return of ballot papers, he had stated, ""Ballot papers must replace EVMs because it will also restore people's trust in the system. The voting percentage will decline if people do not trust the system.""The opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi in Maharashtra is still protesting against the use of EVMs. On Monday, members staged a demonstration on the steps of the Maharashtra Vidhan Bhawan in Nagpur and raised slogans against the use of EVMs in elections.Leader of opposition in the state legislative council Ambadas Danve led the demonstration of the MVA leaders, who called for ""saving"" the Constitution and democracy and opposed the use of EVMs. They raised slogans like ""EVM Hatao Desh Bachao"", ""EVM Hatao Constitution Bachao"" and ""EVM Hatao Democracy Bachao"".The Congress, which faced humiliating defeats in Haryana and Maharashtra, is at the forefront of the campaign against the use of EVMs.A Congress leader has filed a petition in the Supreme Court seeking verification of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) used during Haryana assembly polls. Karan Singh Dalal, a former 5-time MLA, in the plea sought directions to the Election Commission of India (ECI) to lay down a memorandum for the checking and verification of the original burnt memory/microcontroller of the four components of the EVM (Control Unit, Ballot Unit, VVPAT and Symbol Loading Unit).The Centre has cited the Election Commission remarks to reject all opposition charges on EVM tampering. ""Nearly 42 petitions have been filed in the Supreme Court and various high courts questioning the electronic voting machines (EVMs), with the higher judiciary repeatedly holding that the machines are credible, reliable and tamper-proof,"" the government said citing the EC in Lok Sabha recently.The divide over EVM comes days after the partners of INDIA bloc were openly engaged in a leadership tussle with Mamata Banerjee slamming the Congress over its electoral failures and staking claim to lead the opposition front. She was supported by leaders like Sharad Pawar and Lalu Prasad who backed Mamata's claim. The Congress is definitely not alone within the INDIA bloc in questioning the use of EVMs, but the grand old party has been singled out by some of its regional allies highlighting the power tussle within the opposition coalition.","TMC MP Abhishek Banerjee: ""If still someone feels that EVM can be hacked, then they should meet the Election Commission and show how EVMs can be hack"" Congress leader Manickam Tagore: ""It’s the Samajwadi Party, NCP, and Shiv Sena UBT that have spoken against EVM.

Congress mutilated statute to promote 'dynasty': Nirmala

Kharge: PM bhakti taking us towards dictatorship

Rajya Sabha witnessed a fiery start to the two-day-long discussion to mark 75 years of the Constitution with finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman launching a scathing attack on Congress for carrying out major amendments to the statute over the decades with the sole aim to help ""one family"" and promote ""parivarvad"" (dynasticism). She also called Congress ""anti-women"" for failing to get women's reservation bill passed when it was in office.Citing various amendments, ranging from the 42nd constitutional amendment that, among other things, amended the Preamble to insert 'socialist and secular', and enactment of Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986, to nullify a Supreme Court verdict in favour of an old Muslim divorcee woman, the FM said none of these passed the four-fold criteria - economic good, social intent, due process, and constitutional spirit.Her attack drew strong protests from Congress benches. Opening the debate from treasury side, Sitharaman cited example of the first amendment carried out under Jawaharlal Nehru to introduce curbs on freedom of press.She pointed out that during debates in the constituent assembly, B R Ambedkar had opposed incorporation of 'socialism' in the Constitution on grounds that the country's growth trajectory could not be straight-jacketed. ""Still, they put it in the amendment after putting the entire opposition in jail. Only five members voted against it in Lok Sabha, whereas in Rajya Sabha, it was passed unanimously because those who would have opposed it were in jail,"" she added.Taking on Congress for claiming to be defender of the Constitution, the FM referred to supersession of ""inconvenient"" judges by the Indira Gandhi govt and recalled Congress' espousal of the concept of ""committed judiciary"" to say that the party was not sincere in expressing concern about integrity of institutions.She was combative and ceded no quarter when Congress' Jairam Ramesh argued that while attacking Indira for controversial amendments during the Emergency, she should also point out that the former PM voted for their annulment. ""Those amendments were brought by the Morarji Desai govt and her vote was part of a process. People had taught a lesson to her by defeating Congress and she learnt her lesson,"" Sitharaman said. She was supported by BJP chief and leader of the House J P Nadda.Sitharaman pointed out that renowned lyricist Majrooh Sultanpuri and actor Balraj Sahni were jailed in 1949. She said Majrooh was arrested after he refused to apologise for reciting a poem against Nehru at a mill workers' meet. ""That is the level of tolerance they have and they go around with the Constitution in their hand saying there is fear in the country and the Constitution is under threat,"" she added. She highlighted other instances, including banning of the film 'Kissa Kursi Ka' because it questioned Indira and her son.The FM termed Congress ""anti-women"" for not passing women's reservation bill under pressure of its coalition partners. She said Rajiv Gandhi had 426 members in Lok Sabha and 159 members in Rajya Sabha but the party did not have the conviction to pass the bill. ""Clearly, they have always been anti-women. Shah Bano case is a clear example,"" she said.In a no holds barred attack, leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge on Monday accused PM Narendra Modi and BJP of ""misleading the country"" by ""twisting facts"" and speaking ""untruths"" about first PM Jawaharlal Nehru in Parliament. He demanded that the PM apologise for ""distorting facts"" about Nehru's letter on reservation to states.Opening the two-day discussion on the Constitution from the opposition side, Kharge said 'bhakti' of the PM is taking the country towards dictatorship. ""Democracy in the country should not turn into dictatorship,"" he warned. The Congress chief further accused BJP of being against reservations, claiming that was the reason the party was opposed to caste census.Referring to the PM's statement in LS on Saturday, Kharge said Modi ""misled"" the House by saying there was no elected govt between 1947-1952 when Congress had illegally amended the Constitution. The PM on Saturday and FM Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday slammed Congress for the then interim govt led by Nehru bringing the first amendment to curb freedom of press.On the first amendment which was brought through an ordinance in 1951, Kharge said it was done only to preserve reservations of SCs, STs, and BCs as these had been set aside by Supreme Court. He quoted a letter from Sardar Patel to Nehru, in which Patel had suggested that the amendment was the only remedy. The Congress chief said the amendment was done by constituent assembly whose members included Syama Prasad Mookerjee, one of the founders of Jana Sangh. He said the other aspect of this amendment was aimed to stop communal propaganda.Referring to the PM's speech in Lok Sabha, Kharge said, ""Modi distorted facts about Nehru's letters to CMs for which he should apologise to people of the country. He must apologise in both the Houses."" On the Emergency, Kharge said that it was a mistake that was rectified and the result was that Indira Gandhi came back to office with a thumping majority in 1980. Kharge also asked why PM Modi, who was moving around the whole world, had not been able to take out time to visit violence-hit Manipur.","Congress mutilated statute to promote 'dynasty': Nirmala Sitharaman.

Deo said the PM's description of MPs as ‘maal’ was unacceptable and could lower them in popular esteem.The Upper House also saw a brief face off between Deo and her former BJD colleague Sujit Kumar who recently joined BJP and was elected to Rajya Sabha when the BJD MP alleged that those who are “saleable are sold in the market”.Kumar, who took oath as BJP MP on Monday, raised a point of order seeking indulgence of the Chair to direct Deo to prove the charge.PM Modi had while speaking in LS referred to the bribery scandals during no-trust votes against Congress govts led by Narasimha Rao and Manmohan Singh and said Vajpayee refrained from going down the same road, eventually losing the trial of strength by a solitary vote.Participating in the discussion on 75 years of Indian Constitution, Deo referred to Modi’s remark in the Lower House where he said a game was on to destabilise Vajpayee govt in 1998 and there was voting. “Buying and selling was possible then. Bazaar mein maal tab bhi bikta tha (buying and selling was possible at that time as well). But because of the commitment to the values of the Constitution the Vajpayee govt preferred losing election for one vote and resigned, but did not do any unconstitutional thing. This is our history, culture and tradition,” PM had said.Deo said she and all MPs have serious objections to the use of the term ‘maal’. “We are MPs. We respected Atalji because he treated us as MPs. I also have an objection to the very mention of buying and selling. It’s not acceptable to us and I am hurt. Today you (BJP) are inducting a member who resigned from our party. As you have said only sellable items are sold (maal wahi hai jo bikta hai). We will not be sold,” the MP said.The BJD MP also questioned why the President, who comes from Odisha, has so far not spoken on Manipur, Sambhal and atrocities against women in Odisha.",BJD Rajya Sabha MP Sulata Deo on Monday protested PM Narendra Modi’s remark on Saturday in the Lok Sabha that Atal Bihari Vajpayee preferred to resign than buy the support of MPs.

Leadership has to be earned: Omar on Congress

helming INDIA

NEW DELHI: J&K CM Omar Abdullah's dismissal of Congress's allegations of tampering with EVMs and his assertions that he has never blamed the machines for election outcomes put his ally in the state and INDIA bloc on a sticky wicket.Congress has been stepping up its attack on EVMs since its poll losses in Haryana and Maharashtra.""When you get a hundred plus members of Parliament using the same EVMs, and you celebrate that as sort of a victory for your party, you can't then a few months later turn around and say... we don't like these EVMs because now the election results aren't going the way we would like them to,"" Abdullah said in a PTI interview.When told he sounded suspiciously like a BJP spokesperson, he was quoted saying, “God forbid!” He then added, “No, it’s just that... what’s right is right.” “One day voters choose you, the next day they don’t,” Omar Abdullah said. He gave his own example of facing defeat in Lok Sabha polls while winning a majority in the Sept assembly polls. “I never blamed the machines,” he said.He said parties should not contest elections if they do not trust the voting mechanism. “If you have problems with the EVMs, then you should be consistent in those problems,” he said while replying to a question about whether he thinks that the opposition in general, and Congress, in particular, is barking up the wrong tree by focusing on EVMs.National Conference has been “exasperated with Congress” over the way it fought the J&K elections. Abdullah had said midway during the campaign that Congress is unnecessarily focusing on Kashmir when the elections are about how Congress will perform in Jammu.Acknowledging growing discontent among INDIA bloc partners with Congress, Abdullah asked the latter to justify its leadership role in the alliance as it holds a significant position as the largest opposition party in the Parliament. In the interview, he emphasised that leadership has to be “earned and cannot be taken for granted”. The Congress leadership, however, refrained from reacting to the remarks.","Congress has been stepping up its attack on EVMs since its poll losses in Haryana and Maharashtra. “One day voters choose you, the next day they don’t,” Omar Abdullah said. He gave his own example of facing defeat in Lok Sabha polls while winning a majority in the Sept assembly polls.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116346307,imgsize-39968,width-400,resizemode-4/116346307.jpg"
