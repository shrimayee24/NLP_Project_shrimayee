No, it needs improvement Yes, it's effective

BENGALURU: Karnataka deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar 's determined refusal to step down as Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president has intensified the internal power struggle within the party, even as the leadership in Delhi has signalled it is backing him - at least for now.Shivakumar, who returned to Bengaluru after a two-day trip to Delhi, is said to have firmly conveyed to the Congress high command that he would not relinquish the party post unless he is assured of the chief ministership.Sources said the high command has, in turn, communicated to CM Siddaramaiah and his cabinet loyalists, who have been pressing for Shivakumar's removal, that there would be no leadership change in the state unit before the upcoming zilla and taluk panchayat elections later this year.Observers believe Shivakumar's insistence on retaining his KPCC post is closely tied to his goal of becoming CM. Relinquishing it, they say, could weaken his leverage within the party.""There is an undercurrent of one-upmanship between the two stalwarts - Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar - to take control of Congress' state unit. Shivakumar's retention of the KPCC chief's position is seen as a move to balance these power equations,"" said political analyst Vishwas Shetty.The campaign to remove Shivakumar, led by a group of ministers close to Siddaramaiah, including cooperation minister KN Rajanna, was based on the party's ""one man, one post"" principle. But the movement lost momentum following a honeytrap controversy that shook the political establishment. Rajanna's open admission that he was among 48 politicians targeted in the alleged plot forced a temporary pause in the campaign.Unmoved by the internal dissent, Shivakumar has asserted that leadership roles should be earned. ""KPCC positions aren't available in shops, nor can they be obtained by speaking to the media,"" he said in response to his critics.Public works minister Satish Jarkiholi, who has emerged as a key aspirant for the top KPCC role, has publicly pushed for a leadership change. ""There is a written note with the AICC general secretary (organisation) and MP KC Venugopal on the change of the KPCC president after the 2024 Lok Sabha elections,"" Jarkiholi insists, arguing that a dedicated president is crucial to building grassroots support ahead of the 2028 assembly elections.", DK Shivakumar has refused to step down as Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president.

BJD in turmoil over Waqf Bill vote: Naveen Patnaik urged to act against MP Sasmit Patra for voting in favour of legislation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjd-in-turmoil-over-waqf-bill-vote-naveen-patnaik-urged-to-act-against-mp-sasmit-patra-for-voting-in-favour-of-legislation/articleshow/120015216.cms,"Naveen Patnaik and Rajya Sabha MP Sasmit Patra

NEW DELHI: The Biju Janata Dal (BJD) is grappling with internal unrest following Rajya Sabha MP Sasmit Patra’s support for the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2025. Senior party leaders, including former minister Pratap Jena, have urged party president Naveen Patnaik to take disciplinary action, marking the first major intra-party challenge since the BJD's defeat in the 2024 state elections.Jena wrote to Patnaik, demanding accountability for Patra’s stance. The issue intensified after BJD Vice-President Debi Prasad Mishra described the bill as a “debatable issue” and said, “It is up to BJD MPs whether they want to support it or not.”The bill, passed narrowly in both Houses of Parliament, seeks to amend the 1995 Waqf Act to improve property management and digital record-keeping.Congress MP Jairam Ramesh accused the BJD of ""capitulating to BJP pressures at the last minute,"" weakening opposition strength in the Rajya Sabha. ""The 95 number would have been more had not the BJD capitulated,"" Ramesh posted on X.Sasmit Patra confirmed his support for the bill, saying, “The party has decided that the MPs were to vote as per their conscience... I have supported the bill.” BJD sources revealed that four MPs opposed the bill, two supported it, and one abstained.Senior BJD leader and six-time MLA Badri Narayan Patra raised serious concerns, “The party president had explicitly directed members to oppose the Bill… Naveen babu had personally instructed Muzibulla Khan twice — once during a recent Iftar party and again over phone — to vote against the Bill. There is something amiss.”His remarks were echoed by party leaders Shashi Bhusan Behera and Bhupinder Singh, who flagged confusion over BJD’s stance. “All the senior leaders are concerned,” Singh said.A delegation of party leaders, led by deputy leader of opposition Prasanna Acharya, met Naveen Patnaik to express dissatisfaction over the lack of a party whip and the perceived indiscipline. Acharya, while confirming the meeting, said the BJD remains committed to secular values and equidistant from both the NDA and INDIA bloc.Meanwhile, OPCC chief Bhakta Charan Das alleged a tacit deal between the BJD and BJP, hinting that a faction led by Patnaik and aide V K Pandian may merge with the saffron party. BJP’s Babu Singh called the row an “internal discord” while Odisha Law Minister Prithiviraj Harichandan dismissed Congress’s claims.","The Biju Janata Dal (BJD) is grappling with internal unrest following Rajya Sabha MP Sasmit Patra’s support for the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2025.

"Waqf Bill: Who's the 'girgit'?

The legislation, meant to tighten management of waqf properties, has turned into a flashpoint between NDA and Grand Alliance , triggering a war of words, poster blitz and ideological posturing ahead of the high-stakes electoral battle.At the heart of the row is JDU's support for the bill, which has drawn stinging criticism from the opposition, particularly RJD. Defending its stance, JDU claimed it backed the legislation only after JPC accepted all five of its key recommendations. Party spokesperson Anjum Ara listed these as keeping land under the state list, ensuring the law applies prospectively, preserving the status of religious structures on unregistered waqf land, raising the rank of officers resolving disputes, and extending the digitisation deadline.RJD's attacks have continued, nonetheless. Calling the bill ""unconstitutional"", party functionary Tejashwi Yadav vowed it would be scrapped if Grand Alliance took office. ""This bill won't be implemented at any cost, it will be thrown into the dustbin,"" he said.A poster war has also erupted. RJD kicked it off by likening CM Nitish Kumar to a 'chameleon'. In retaliation, JDU posters accused RJD chief Lalu Prasad of similar flip-flopping, pointing to his 2010 speech in Lok Sabha demanding strict laws for waqf property, which contrasts with RJD's opposition to the bill now.Adding to the fire, governor Arif Mohammed Khan backed the bill, describing it as a necessary reform. ""Which waqf board is actually serving the poor - running orphanages or hospitals?"" he asked, arguing that waqf assets should be used for public good.Union minister Chirag Paswan, too, has joined in, accusing the opposition of stoking fear among Muslims.","The Waqf (Amendment) Bill, cleared by both Houses of Parliament, has led to a fierce political storm in Bihar.
