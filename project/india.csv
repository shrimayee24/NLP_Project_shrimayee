'BJP afraid of PDA unity': Akhilesh Yadav on UP govt's 'caste' order; alleges 'discrimination' in postings,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-afraid-of-pda-unity-akhilesh-yadav-on-up-govts-caste-order-alleges-discrimination-in-postings/articleshow/124074827.cms,"SP chief Akhilesh Yadav (ANI)

NEW DELHI: Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav on Tuesday hit out at the BJP-led Uttar Pradesh government’s directive to remove caste references from police records and public notices, saying it reflected the ruling party’s “fear” of PDA communities uniting against it.“From police stations to administrative offices, discrimination has taken place on the basis of caste and religion. The BJP has ensured postings go to its own caste-dominated people. Today, the BJP is afraid of PDA unity,” PTI quoted Yadav as saying.PDA—an acronym for ""Pichda, Dalit, Alpasankhyak"" (backward classes, Dalits, minorities)—is a political construct coined and frequently invoked by Yadav, who insists these groups together can defeat the BJP.The former chief minister conceded the government’s order follows an Allahabad high court judgment but argued that caste remains the “first emotional bond” in society. “Netaji (his father Mulayam Singh Yadav) also kept struggling for this. At different times, in the name of Bahujan Samaj, we all came together,” he added.Yadav alleged that in Gorakhpur, chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s stronghold, most postings have gone to people of “one caste.”""Even in the UP STF, caste is the primary factor. Contracts at the headquarters have also been given to one caste. Only when the court intervened has this government been forced to act,"" the Kannauj MP claimed.On Sunday, the state government banned caste-based rallies and public events with “political motives,” warning that social media content glorifying caste pride or promoting hatred would be closely monitored.According to a senior official, the order—circulated to all police units and district administrations—was issued in compliance with the Allahabad high court’s September 16 verdict in the Praveen Chetri vs State of UP case. The ruling barred police from mentioning caste in case records and directed the state to prevent caste glorification in public and digital spaces.Following the order, officiating chief secretary Deepak Kumar instructed that caste of accused persons must not be recorded in FIRs, case memos, arrest documents, or on police station notice boards. The Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS) portal will also be updated to delete caste fields; until then, officials have been told to leave them blank.The order also mandates recording both father’s and mother’s names of accused persons, challaning vehicles carrying caste-based stickers or slogans under the Motor Vehicles Act, and removing boards or signs in towns and villages that glorify caste identities.","Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav hit out at the BJP-led Uttar Pradesh government’s directive to remove caste references from police records and public notices.

‘Invested in real estate’: BJP shares video of Tirumala temple 'loot'; claims ‘crores of wealth’ siphoned under Jagan government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/invested-in-real-estate-bjp-shares-video-of-tirumala-temple-loot-claims-crores-of-wealth-siphoned-under-jagan-government/articleshow/124038535.cms,"Photo/Agencies

Poll Do you believe that the alleged theft from the Tirumala temple should be thoroughly investigated? Yes, it should be investigated No, it's not necessary

NEW DELHI: Andhra Pradesh’s ruling Telugu Desam Party ( TDP ) leader and MLA Nara Lokesh has alleged that over Rs 100 crore was stolen from the parakamani (donation box) of the Tirumala temple during the YSR Congress Party government led by YS Jagan Mohan Reddy.Lokesh, who is also TDP’s general secretary, shared purported CCTV footage on X on Saturday, claiming it shows large-scale misappropriation of Lord Venkateswara’s offerings.“YCP thieves have looted the sacred property of Lord Venkateswara. YCP leaders are behind the ‘hundred crore Parakamani theft’. During Jagan’s five-year rule, corruption reigned supreme. Anarchy ran rampant. Jagan turned Andhra Pradesh into a haven for thieves, looters, and mafia dons. The Jagan gang plundered mines, lands, forests, and all resources, along with exploiting the people... and in the end, they did not even spare the sacred property of Lord Venkateswara in Tirumala,” said Lokesh in his post.He also accused former Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) Chairman Bhumana Karunakar Reddy of facilitating the scam and claimed that “shares of the loot” reached Tadepalli Palace, the residence of then chief minister Jagan.TTD is the official custodian of Sri Venkateswara temple in Tirupati, the richest Hindu shrine in the world.Lokesh alleged that the stolen funds were diverted into real estate and attempts were made to “settle” the matter in a Lok Adalat. “With the backing of power, Jagan’s gang committed every possible sacrilege against Lord Venkateswara,” he added.""The sins of Jagan’s gang, the former rulers who looted the temple and its hundi, have now come to fruition. The Parakamani videos have surfaced today. Tomorrow, the accused themselves will reveal the full list of YCP’s sins,"" he added.BJP leader Bhanuprakash Reddy also reshared the video posted by Lokesh.In 2024, the TTD was embroiled in a controversy when lab tests revealed that the ghee used in its famous laddu prasadam was contaminated with adulterated animal fats.","Andhra Pradesh’s ruling Telugu Desam Party ( TDP ) leader and MLA Nara Lokesh has alleged that over Rs 100 crore was stolen from the Tirumala temple during the YSR Congress Party government.

NEW DELHI: The seat-sharing negotiations for upcoming assembly elections in Bihar have become more complex as two new parties - Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and Pashupati Paras's LJP faction - joined the Mahagathbandhan alliance. The situation is getting trickier as major parties are firm on their seat demands.The 243 seats will now be divided among eight parties -- Rashtriya Janata Dal, Congress, CPI, CPM, VIP, LJP (Paras) and JMM.“Two more parties are expected to be part of the INDIA bloc soon and we all have to sacrifice our share of seats to accommodate the new partners.” State Congress president Rajesh Kumar told reporters after a discussion during a key meeting of INDIA bloc leaders at the official residence of RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav.Meanwhile, Congress insist that it cannot go below the 70 seats.VIP chief Mukesh Sahani, on the other hand, has demanded “60 seats plus the post of deputy CM” while the CPI-ML is pressing for at least 40 seats, pointing to its past performance.The RJD is also unwilling to contest on fewer than 150 seats.In 2020 assembly elections, Rashtriya Janata Dal had contested on 144 seats, of which it won 75.Congress won 19 out of 70 seats.CPI-ML contested 19 seats and won 12.CPM contested 4 seats and was successful in winning 2 seats.CPI contested on 6 seats and won 2 seats.RJD's Tejashwi Yadav has already declared himself as the CM face of the opposition INDIA bloc.Addressing the rally in Ara town, the last stopover of the 'Voter Adhikar Yatra', Tejashwi questioned the Nitish Kumar government in Bihar for ""frequently copying his ideas"" and described it as a ""copycat government"". Ridiculing the government for copying his ideas, he said that at present he was moving ahead while the govt was behind him.""Tejashwi aage-aage, Sarkar pichhe-pichhe. Original CM chahiye ki duplicate?"" (Tejashwi is moving ahead while the govt is following him from behind. Do you want a duplicate CM or the original CM?), Tejashwi asked the crowd.","Two new parties - Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and Pashupati Paras's LJP faction - joined the Mahagathbandhan alliance.
