‘Is There Any Law?’ Renuka Chaudhary Sparks Row After Bringing Stray Dog to Parliament

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday weighed in on the controversy over colleague Renuka Chowdhury bringing a stray dog to Parliament House, saying pets are not allowed outside the complex but “inside”.“Dog is the main topic of today, I believe. What has the poor dog done. The dog had come here. Why is it not allowed?” Gandhi told reporters, as quoted by PTI.Pointing towards the Parliament House building, he said, “Pets are not allowed here but they are allowed inside.”“I guess these are the things that India is discussing these days,” he added.Gandhi’s comments drew criticism from BJP spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari, who said on X, “Rahul Gandhi is comparing his own Congressmen, and Opposition leaders to Dog! This is how Parivarvadi treat temple of democracy.”Congress MP Renuka Chowdhury on Monday brought a stray dog onto the Parliament grounds on the first day of the Winter Session, despite objections from fellow MPs. Defending her action, she reportedly said that the ""real dogs are sitting in Parliament"" who regularly bite people.Chowdhury later explained that she had found the puppy on her way to Parliament. She said she stopped after witnessing a collision between a scooter and a car, and noticed the puppy by the roadside before deciding to take it with her.","Congress MP Renuka Chowdhury brought a stray dog onto the Parliament grounds on the first day of the Winter Session.

Marking a Political Milestone, Nitish Kumar Sworn In as Bihar CM for the 10th Time

PATNA: BJP’s Prem Kumar, who won the Gaya Town assembly seat for a record ninth time in the recent Bihar elections, was unanimously elected assembly speaker on Tuesday, succeeding his party colleague Nand Kishore Yadav.Kumar, 70, was the only one who had filed a nomination for the post. Slogans of “Bharat Mata Ki Jai” and “Jai Shri Ram” were raised in the House soon after he was declared “unanimously elected” by voice vote.Having bagged the speaker’s post just days after securing the key home portfolio, held by CM Nitish Kumar for nearly 20 years, BJP has further tightened its grip over the NDA govt in Bihar.The speaker’s role has become increasingly crucial in the state, which has witnessed repeated changes in govts over the past eight years owing to unpredictable shifts in political alliances.JDU minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary, however, dismissed the suggestion that the party had been stripped of the speaker’s post. “When did we have the post that we lost it?” Choudhary, said to reporters. JDU held the post from Nov 2005 to Nov 2020, with Choudhary himself serving one term.","BJP’s Prem Kumar, who won the Gaya Town assembly seat for a record ninth time in the recent Bihar elections, was unanimously elected assembly speaker on Tuesday.

Aman’s father, Suresh Kumar, rejected the govt’s compensation of Rs 5 lakh. “We want an FIR against those responsible for my son’s death. It may not be ‘under the sports department’ on paper, but why did the department never intervene on safety? We do not want compensation or clean chits in the name of inquiries,” he said.Strangely, the Rohtak report was prepared by the same district sports officer (DSO), who was suspended after the incident. Hardik died on Nov 25 and DSO Anoop Singh was suspended the very next day. But the report signed by Anoop is dated Nov 26. Does it mean he submitted the report before his suspension? Which would indicate that he wrapped up the investigation into the boy’s death in a matter of hours and gave his department the clean chit.What’s more, the same report was endorsed by sports deputy director Sunita Khatri, who marked it to director-sports, Rohtak division, Panchkula, on Nov 27, while was (and is) still under suspension.","The Rohtak report was prepared by the same district sports officer (DSO), who was suspended after the incident.
