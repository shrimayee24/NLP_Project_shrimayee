PILIBHIT: Days after VHP's regional organisation in-charge Prince Gaur was arrested on Nov 8 under charges of ""forgery, extortion and criminal intimidation"" for allegedly demanding money from Pilibhit ADM (finance and revenue) Ritu Punia, police Monday ""dropped serious charges"" from the FIR.These charges carried punishments ranging from 10 years prison to life and also prevented release on bail through district-level courts. Police move purportedly came after VHP's state organisation minister, Rajesh, met the DM and SP, and warned of a ""huge protest"".Notably, an FIR was registered initially under BNS sections 132 (2), 336 (3), 338, 340 (2), 308 (5) and 351 (2). Of these, the accused could be sentenced to life under BNS section 338, while he could be convicted with imprisonment for 10 years under BNS 308 (5). On Monday, the cops ""replaced"" section 308 (5) - having a provision of a 10-year sentence - with section 308 (4) that confines the imprisonment to a maximum seven years, and ""dropped"" sections 338, 336 (3) and 340 (2) from the FIR.Gaur's lawyer Ashwani Agnihotri told TOI: ""Satish Kumar, the investigating officer in Gaur's case filed his report to the CJM's court, confirming the removal of certain BNS sections and modification in one of them.""The ADM had filed an FIR against Gaur in Pilibhit's Kotwali thana on Nov 6. In her complaint, she stated: ""Gaur levelled allegations against me for imposing excessive fine in a stamp duty evasion case along with enforcing legal action under section 80 of UP Revenue Code in a matter associated with the development of a residential colony, apart from intimidating a few persons linked with the development project.""Regarding section 80, the Additional District Magistrate pointed out that the powers of execution under this section were vested with the SDM, while the city magistrate was the designated administrative officer for the regulated area to deal with development of colonies. ""But Gaur intentionally dragged my name into all these irrelevant matters with the intent to only harass and defame me. Gaur demanded extortion money as well,"" the ADM claimed.Pilibhit DM Gyanendra Singh said, ""We have asked the VHP state functionary to give in writing whatever objections he had regarding the enforcement of legal proceedings against Prince Gaur. We shall take steps in a fair and transparent manner as per the law."" ASP Vikram Dahiya added, ""Yes, we're aware of the matter. FIR was registered based on a written complaint of a senior administrative officer; the case is under investigation. ..""Meanwhile, VHP functionary Rajesh said, ""The main motive behind the FIR was to hide the ADM's misdeeds and some of the charges levelled by Gaur. We want a probe to be held on Gaur's complaint and truth should finally come out.""","Prince Gaur was arrested on Nov 8 under charges of ""forgery, extortion and criminal intimidation"" He allegedly demanded money from Pilibhit ADM (finance and revenue) Ritu Punia.
