‘Nothing to learn’: How Congress reacted to Digvijaya Singh’s RSS praise; senior leader clarifies stance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nothing-to-learn-how-congress-reacted-to-digvijaya-singhs-rss-praise-senior-leader-clarifies-stance/articleshow/126212155.cms,"Congress Rift Out In Open? Digvijaya Singh's Modi-RSS Praise Draws Jibes From BJP Amid CWC Meet

'Power of the organisation'

BJP attacks Rahul Gandhi

NEW DELHI: Congress on Sunday stopped short of agreeing with its senior leader Digvijay Singh after he gave example of Rashtriya Swayamseva Sangh ( RSS ) to call for organisational reforms within Congress.Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera, reacting to former Madhya Pradesh chief minister's remarks said that an organisation known for Godse can not teach anything to a organisation founded by Gandhi.""There's nothing to learn from the RSS. What can an organisation known for Godse teach an organisation founded by Gandhi?"" Khera said.Earlier on Saturday Digvijay praised the organisational strength of RSS and shared a black-and-white photograph from a social media platform that showed Prime Minister Narendra Modi seated back on the ground while BJP veteran Lal Krishna Advani sat on a chair in the background, acknowledging how the RSS shapes leadership within the organisation.""I found this image on the Quora site. It’s very impressive. How an RSS grassroots swayamsevak and Jan Sangh BJP worker sat on the floor at the feet of leaders and became the state’s Chief Minister and the country’s Prime Minister. This is the power of the organisation.""However, he issued a clarification, saying, ""I've been saying this from the beginning: I am opposed to the ideology of the RSS. They neither respect the Constitution nor the country's laws, and it's an unregistered organisation.""""But I admire their organisational capacity because an organisation that isn't even registered has become so powerful that the Prime Minister says from the Red Fort that it is the world's largest NGO. If it's an NGO, then where have your rules and regulations gone? But I admire their organisational capacity,"" he added.Earlier this week, Singh had also praised Rahul Gandhi for his stance on socio-economic issues, giving him ""full marks"" while calling for internal reforms within the Congress. Drawing a parallel with Rahul Gandhi’s push for Election Commission reforms, Singh argued that the party itself needed similar changes.In another post on X, he wrote, ""Rahul ji you are absolutely ‘Bang On’ in matters of Socio-Economic Issues. Full Marks. But now please look at Congress also. Like Election Commission needs Reforms, So Does Indian National Congress. You have started with 'संघटन सृजन' But we need more Pragmatic Decentralised Functioning.""He added, ""I am sure you would do it because I know you can do it. Only problem is that it is not easy to ‘Convince’ you!!""Meanwhile, BJP alleged that Digvijay's praise for the organisational power of the BJP and the RSS was an ""open dissent"" against Rahul Gandhi's leadership in the party.BJP national spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi alleged that Rahul was bringing his party ""upside down"" because he had been sidelined in the party.""It's because our Narendra Modi is 'guddri ke lal' (diamond in the rough) and their leader is 'Jawahar ke lal' (great-grandson of Jawaharlal Nehru). Since our Narendra Modi has risen to top from bottom, he is taking the party (BJP) also to the top from bottom,"" Trivedi told a press conference at the BJP headquarters here.In a swipe to Rahul, he said, ""Since their leader is 'Jawahar ke lal' who is now 'side down from up', he is bringing his party upside down.""This comes after the Congress held the CWC meet in Delhi on Saturday under the chaimanship of party chief Mallikarjun Kharge -- first after the party suffered a huge loss in Bihar assembly elections.After the CWC meet, Kharge announced that the grand-old-party launch a nation-wide protest against the Centre for replacing rural employment scheme - MGNREGA - with VB G-RAM-G law from January 5.""In the meeting, we took an oath. We decided to launch a massive movement across the country, making the MNREGA scheme the central point. Indian National Congress party, taking a leading role, will launch the Save MNREGA Campaign from January 5th,"" Kharge said.","Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said that an organisation known for Godse can not teach anything to a organisation founded by Gandhi.

'Called Minor Matter, Refused FIR': Tripura Student Angel Chakma's Father Blasts Uttarakhand Police

NEW DELHI: Expressing horror at the ""hate crime"" murder of Anjel Chakma in Dehradun, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday blamed the ""hate spewing"" leadership of BJP for normalising prejudice, which, he said, is being fed for years through toxic content and irresponsible narratives.Assam Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi said Chakma was killed after being called a ""Chinese"" while the oldest tribe of Karbi are facing ""Chinese go back"" slogans in their own land of Karbi Anglong in Assam, as he accused the governing BJP of failing to celebrate the diversity of the country.Gogoi said there was a 12-day delay in filing the case in Chakma's murder and the main accused has gone absconding. He demanded an inquiry into lax action and immediate arrest of the accused.The Assam Congress chief said the people of the North-East are facing prejudice on a daily basis across states while ""our PM and the entire machinery supporting him is only focused on changing the mindset of India from one that celebrates its diversity to one that focuses only on one identity"".He said BJP govt is not able to understand the anger among the people of the North-East against the Centre. ""Neither could they understand it in Manipur, nor in Karbi Anglong.They are also unable to understand the doubts in the minds of the people of the region in the Anjel Chakma case. The PM only uses people as a prop, who are collected during his trips and then sent back after a photo-op,"" he said.Gogoi said he too was once asked at Agra where he hailed from and was asked to show his passport. ""Only the people of the North-East understand this pain. And, it takes a lot of courage to proudly carry our country's flag despite such experiences. This is evidence of our tolerance and our patriotism,"" he said.Rahul said, ""India is built on respect and unity, not fear and abuse. We are a country of love and diversity. We must not become a dead society that looks away while fellow Indians are targeted. We must reflect and confront what we are allowing our country to become.""","Assam Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi said Chakma was killed after being called a ""Chinese"" while the oldest tribe of Karbi are facing ""Chinese go back"" slogans in their own land.
