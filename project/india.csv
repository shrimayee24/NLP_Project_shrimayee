NASHIK/KOLHAPUR: AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said PM Modi speaks of late Balasaheb Thackeray during his rallies, but he ""backstabbed his son (Uddhav)."" She also challenged Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah to conduct the caste census and remove the 50% cap on reservation.Priyanka was addressing campaign rallies in Shirdi and Kolhapur for the assembly election in Maharashtra on Saturday when she took on the PM and BJP .

(Bal Thackerayji ki baat karte hai, aur unhi ke bete ke peeth mein chura ghopa),"" she said addressing a rally at the Gandhi Maidan in Kolhapur. Earlier, speaking in Shirdi, Priyanka said that their (Congress) political ideology was different from the late Balasaheb's in the past. ""But Balasaheb, Rahul, or any Congress politician would not tolerate the way BJP and Modi have insulted Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj,"" she said while referring to the statue collapse in Sindhudurg, removal of the Maratha king's statue from Parliament and non-completion of the warrior king's statue for which Modi had laid the foundation stone seven years ago in the Arabian Sea, off Mumbai.Priyanka referred to the recent speech of PM Modi at Shivaji Park in Mumbai in which he attacked her brother Rahul Gandhi.

In Mumbai's speech, he (Modi) said Rahul Gandhi was against reservation. Rahul Gandhi walked for 4,000 km, led Nyay Yatra from Manipur to Mumbai. Everywhere, he was raising the issue of the caste-based census and doing away with 50% cap on reservations. They lie because they are scared...,"" she added.She then attacked BJP by saying that it has made a ""mockery of the Indian Constitution by stealing the elected govt"" of Maha Vikas Aghadi in Maharashtra.""The country's Constitution empowers the electorate to elect a govt of their choice by exercising their franchise. In Maharashtra, in 2019, the voters elected MVA to form govt. But BJP, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and his party colleagues used money and the central agencies to steal the publicly-elected govt. It is nowhere written that a govt can be formed by such unfair means,"" Priyanka said.She asked aloud how BJP could use such a huge amount of money to topple MVA government. ""Did BJP use the money meant for development projects in Maharashtra to get rid of MVA government?"" she questioned.Accusing Modi of taking away industrial investments from Maharashtra, Priyanka said former PMs Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi were not partisan when it came to the implementation of big projects during their tenures. She questioned why Mahayuti had not implemented the Ladki Bahin Yojana soon after it was formed two and a half years ago. She said Modi had no respect for Maharashtra since in the midst of an important election, the PM left the country. Priyanka also said PM Modi's recent speeches had disappointed her because she could not see any truth in them.

AGRA: A bride walked out of her wedding after the groom refused to perform the main rituals unless his demand for Rs 30 lakh dowry was met at the venue. Ravi Kumar, a police constable posted in Agra, was arrested after a case against him was filed by the bride’s father, a sub-inspector posted in Ghaziabad.The dowry demand was allegedly made shortly after the groom’s party arrived and the garland exchange (varmala) ritual was performed. When the bride’s family expressed their inability to give such a huge amount, an argument ensued between the two parties.Realising that her knight in shining armour wasn’t what he had initially shown her to be, the bride refused to marry him, terming his actions unacceptable. Khandauli SHO Rakesh Singh Chauhan said a case under BNS section 352 (intention insult) and sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act was registered against Ravi Kumar.“The groom was arrested, but released on bail later after being served a notice,” said SHO Chauhan.A member from bride’s side said, “Her father had already spent lakhs of rupees on the wedding. Also, household goods and other appliances worth several lakhs of rupees were given. Still, the groom demanded Rs 30 lakh in cash on the wedding night.”","Ravi Kumar, a police constable posted in Agra, was arrested after a case against him was filed by the bride's father.

Hindu students should get leave on Tuesday: Himanta Biswa Sarma,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/hindu-students-should-get-leaves-on-tuesday-himanta-biswa-sarma/articleshow/115354643.cms,"RANCHI: Hitting out at the Hemant Soren government , Assam chief minister and Jharkhand BJP’s co-in-charge, Himanta Biswa Sarma , accused the coalition regime in Jharkhand of targeting schools for its appeasement politics .Addressing a poll rally in Jarmuni on Thursday, Sarma questioned the JMM-Congress-RJD government for closing down schools in the Jamtara and Sahibganj districts on Fridays.He said, “Despite having a tribal chief minister in Jharkhand, tribals are not receiving the respect they deserve for their rights and culture. On the contrary, this government is working only for infiltrators. Schools in Jamtara and Sahibganj are closed on Fridays (Muslims observe Jumma on Fridays).By that logic, schools should also be closed on Tuesdays, as Hindus pray to Hanumanji on this day. Such has become the situation in this state that Ram Navami processions and Durga Puja are not allowed in Jharkhand.”He added that Hindus need to unite, as their votes are getting divided, while votes from infiltrators go to one party. “Therefore, we must stay united to remain safe. People like Rahul Gandhi, Alamgir Alam (former minister), and Irfan Ansari (outgoing MLA of Jamtara) try to divide our society in every election. They work to split our society into SC-ST-OBC during elections,” he said.While the BJP is using Bangladeshi infiltration as one of its key poll planks in Jharkhand, the ruling JMM-Congress-RJD camp has been accusing the BJP of engaging in divisive politics. Sarma has been highly vocal on this issue, even questioning the Hemant government for allegedly patronizing infiltrators for vote bank politics.He remarked, “Due to infiltration, the tribal population is continuously decreasing here, and the demography of Santhal Parganas is changing rapidly. But this government is in continuous denial. Currently, Hindus make up 67% and Muslims 33% of the population. Infiltrators have started coming into our Santhal Pargana, but the government has not paid attention to this issue. These are Bangladeshi infiltrators , not Muslims from Jharkhand. In Pakur and Sahibganj, this population has reached 35%.”Sarma accused Hemant Soren and his party of being anti-tribal. “The JMM is not a party for tribals; it has become a party for infiltrators for vote bank politics. Infiltrators have taken over tribal lands and are plundering our resources. Once the BJP government is formed, infiltrators' children will not receive tribal certificates, nor will they be allowed to contest for the position of Mukhiya. Lands taken by infiltrators from tribals will be returned,” he said.","Assam chief minister and Jharkhand BJP’s co-in-charge, Himanta Biswa Sarma, accused the coalition regime of targeting schools for its appeasement politics.

The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections , which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases. The results will be declared on November 23, along with Maharashtra.In the Tribal-dominated state, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and CM Hemant's Soren Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) are in a direct fight, while the Congress party and Lalu Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) are in alliance with the JMM.The JMM-Congress-RJD alliance are also reportedly seeking to deal with Left parties, Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party and other tribal outfits that have been contesting the elections in the state as independent entities and make efforts to field candidates against the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) on all 81 seats collectively.In the last assembly polls in 2019, the JMM-Congress-RJD alliance won a comfortable majority of 47 seats in a House of 81.The BJP slipped to 25 seats from 37 it held in 2014. The poor performance was perceived to be the outcome of its decision to contest alone backfiring. The party did not foster an alliance with the Ajsu in the 2019 polls when Raghubar Das, currently the Odisha governor, was serving the state as CM.In this year's Lok Sabha polls in Jharkhand, the BJP-led NDA secured nine out of the 14 seats, with the BJP winning eight and its alliance partner, the Ajsu (All Jharkhand Students Union) Party, retaining its single seat.On the other hand, the opposition India bloc improved its tally, increasing its seat count from two in 2019 to five in the parliamentary polls.BJP and JMM have spruced up their pace of campaigning from the ground zero to social media. BJP and JMM leaders are actively rebutting and challenging each other on a range of issues, including illegal immigration, youth welfare, employment and housing.INDIA bloc parties in Jharkhand slammed the EC for holding assembly elections in the state along with that of Maharashtra but claimed that they were ready to slug it out with BJP-led NDA, which has welcomed the announcement of poll dates.JMM, Congress, and CPI (ML-L) said the announcement showed that EC was in a hurry to conduct elections though the assembly tenure was due to end in January next year.Also, both the INDIA bloc and BJP-led NDA are expected to get into huddles to discuss the modalities of seat-sharing which is going to be a challenge for both the competing teams.","The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections, which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra. Elections in Maharashtra will be held in single phase on November 20. The counting of votes will be on November 23.Maharashtra is gearing up for elections as the two major political alliances—the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) and the Mahayuti—prepare to face each other for the first time in a Vidhan Sabha election.The Maha Vikas Aghadi, comprise of the Congress, the Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray), and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) under Sharad Pawar, will go head-to-head with the Mahayuti , which includes the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Shiv Sena faction led by Eknath Shinde, and the NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar. This will be the first electoral contest between these two alliances since the splits within the Shiv Sena and NCP.The MVA is hopeful of replicating its recent Lok Sabha success, while the Mahayuti aims to retain power by leveraging its populist schemes targeted at women and youth. Both alliances have set their sights on winning the state.Narayan Rane, a former Union Minister and the victor in the Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg Lok Sabha constituency, is poised to be a key figure for the BJP in the Konkan region during the forthcoming elections. Meanwhile, two constituencies are expected to be critical battlegrounds: chief minister Eknath Shinde's Kopri-Pachpakdi seat in Thane City and Worli in Mumbai, where Aaditya Thackeray, a leader of the Shiv Sena (UBT), is seeking reelection.In the last Vidhan Sabha elections in 2019, the BJP secured 26.1% of the votes, the Congress 16.1%, the NCP 16.9%, and the Shiv Sena 16.6%. The BJP and the Shiv Sena (then united) formed the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which secured a majority. However, the coalition soon crumbled due to disagreements over government formation, plunging the state into a political crisis.After no party could establish a government, Maharashtra was placed under President's rule. Devendra Fadnavis was briefly sworn in as chief minister, with Ajit Pawar as deputy chief minister. However, both resigned just days later before a scheduled floor test.By November 28, 2019, a new coalition emerged, with the Shiv Sena (Uddhav faction), NCP (Sharad Pawar faction), and Congress forming the Maha Vikas Aghadi government, led by Uddhav Thackeray as chief minister.The state's politics took another turn in June, 2022, when Uddhav Thackeray resigned following a rebellion within the Shiv Sena, led by Eknath Shinde, who then allied with the BJP. Eknath Shinde assumed the role of chief minister, with Devendra Fadnavis returning as deputy chief minister.",The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra. Elections in Maharashtra will be held in single phase on November 20. The counting of votes will be on November 23.
