Congress on Saturday accused BJP and RSS outfits of targeting Kashmiris and Muslims across states in the aftermath of the Pahalgam terrorist attack , alleging that such actions reflect Pakistan's intent behind the assault - to hit the livelihood of Kashmiris and disrupt Hindu-Muslim unity in India.After Congress assured the BJP govt of its support for any action it proposes to take in response to the attack , it blamed intelligence failure and security lapses for the latest terror act.Party spokesperson Pawan Khera said BJP lost no time after Pahalgam to play the communal card, with its Karnataka and Chhattisgarh social media handles putting out objectionable content about the attack, which was also insensitive in its depiction of the dead and the widows.
