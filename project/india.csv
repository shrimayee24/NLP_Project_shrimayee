"Telangana assembly passes 2 bills to up backward classes quota to 42%, total reservation to 70%",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/telangana-assembly-passes-2-bills-to-up-backward-class-quota-to-42-total-reservation-to-70/articleshow/119139009.cms,"T’gana banks on door-to-door survey data to build quota case



HYDERABAD : An eight-hour reservation debate in the Telangana assembly on Monday culminated in the passage of two landmark bills that aim to extend the quantum of reservation in education , govt jobs and rural and urban self-governance from 50% to 70%, breaching Supreme Court’s cap on quotas.CM A Revanth Reddy showcased political unanimity in passing the bills – BRS, BJP, AIMIM and CPI backed the move – as a sign that the state’s reservation framework deserved to be enshrined with a constitutional amendment during the ongoing session of Parliament.The first of the proposed laws — Telangana Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes & Scheduled Tribes (reservation of seats and appointments) Bill 2025 — proposes a 42% quota for BCs, 18% for SCs and 10% for STs, up from the existing 29% for BCs, 15% for SCs and 6% for STs.Telangana Backward Classes (reservation of seats in rural and urban local bodies) Bill 2025 extends the 42% BC quota to rural and urban local bodies. Before this, BC reservation in local bodies ranged from 18% to 23%, depending on population of each municipality or panchayat.Revanth put his hand up to lead an all-party delegation to PM Modi and other senior MPs to press for the proposed constitutional amendment. He said empirical data from a door-to-door survey by state govt would drive this amendment. The data, which includes information on BCs, SCs, and STs, is being presented as a bulletproof argument for exceeding the 50% cap on reservations, a step Supreme Court had indicated could be considered if the numbers backed it.Speaker Gaddam Prasad Kumar said the initial plan was to earmark 15% for SCs, which was increased to 18% based on a suggestion by AIMIM’s Akbaruddin Owaisi. But the House rejected three amendments proposed by BRS. These called for a 42% quota for BCs in all govt contracts, creation of a BC subplan similar to those for SCs and STs, and a Rs 20,000-crore allocation for BC welfare in the upcoming budget.Revanth, along with deputy CM Bhatti Vikramarka and BC welfare minister Ponnam Prabhakar, expressed confidence that a constitutional amendment was a matter of time. Prabhakar urged all political parties to set aside their differences to institutionalise the 42% BC quota, drawing inspiration from Tamil Nadu’s success in securing similar reservation for them through bipartisan support.The assembly also discussed Telangana Scheduled Castes (rationalisation of reservations) Bill, which deals with the sub-classification of SCs. It will be debated on Tuesday before being sent to the governor for approval. Supreme Court has empowered states to sub-classify SCs.Revanth informed the House that the erstwhile BRS govt had sent a proposal to Centre for 37% BC reservation. He said Congress govt would withdraw that proposal and send a new one for 42% reservation as the two proposals couldn’t coexist.","Two landmark bills aim to extend quantum of reservation in education, govt jobs and rural and urban self-governance from 50% to 70%.

Devendra Fadnavis laments govt has to protect Aurangzeb's grave,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/devendra-fadnavis-laments-govt-has-to-protect-aurangzebs-grave/articleshow/119136914.cms,"KALYAN/MUMBAI: Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis Monday warned that his government would take action if any attempt was made to glorify Aurangzeb in the state even as there was an uproar in the legislative assembly and council over PCC chief Harshvardhan Sapkal 's statement comparing the chief minister to the Mughal emperor.After inaugurating the Shaktipeeth temple dedicated to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in Bhiwandi, Fadnavis said it is ""unfortunate that the government has to take responsibility for protection of Aurangzeb's grave despite his history of persecution"". He added that any glorification in Maharashtra will solely be of the Maratha ruler. ""Anyone attempting to glorify or promote the brutal ideologies of the tyrant Aurangzeb will face strict legal action, ensuring such ideologies are eradicated,"" the Maharashtra CM said.Amid demands from the right-wing groups for removal of Aurangzeb's tomb in Khultabad, BJP minister Nitesh Rane, at another event in Pune district, invoked the demolition of Babri Masjid and asked Hindutva outfits ""to do their duty while government will carry out its responsibilities"". Even as Mahayuti legislatures demanded action against Sapkal for his remarks against the CM, the state Congress chief remained firm on Monday, saying: ""BJP leaders themselves compared CM Fadnavis to the cruel Aurangzeb.""Sapkal had said in Beed on Sunday, ""Aurangzeb was a cruel ruler. Today, CM Devendra Fadnavis is an equally cruel ruler. He always supports issues related to religion but does nothing about cases like the murder of (Massajog) sarpanch Santosh Deshmukh.""Deputy CM Ajit Pawar told the assembly that Sapkal's remarks would be investigated. ""Certain comments are made to please party seniors and grab eyeballs. But their (opposition's) vote share gets decreased and their true colours are seen. If such wrong remarks are made against persons in important positions, they will be verified and action will be taken,"" he said. In the council, when chairman Ram Shinde commenced the question hour, BJP members began sloganeering, leading to adjournment of the House for ten minutes. When the House reassembled, revenue minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule said Sapkal's statement was wrong and the government will take action in this regard.BJP's Pravin Darekar said Sapkal had not just insulted the post of the chief minister but also the state of Maharashtra. ""Sapkal must be counselled.""Defending his remark, Sapkal said comparing Fadnavis' governance to that of Aurangzeb highlights similarities between their regimes, not the individuals themselves.""I did not use derogatory language against CM Fadnavis, nor did I address him disrespectfully, yet BJP leaders are resorting to personal attacks against me.""",Devendra Fadnavis: Government has to take responsibility for protection of Aurangzeb's grave.
