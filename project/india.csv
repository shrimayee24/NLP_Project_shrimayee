"Can't free Katara case lifer after 20-year term, Delhi government tells SC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cant-free-katara-case-lifer-after-20-year-term-delhi-government-tells-sc/articleshow/118542041.cms,"SC: 20-year jail terms would become meaningless if state takes such stand

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Monday took exception to Delhi govt's stand that a convict, sentenced to life imprisonment with 20 years of jail term without remission , could not be released even after completion of the period.A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan expressed surprise over the oral submission made by the Delhi govt counsel in the case of convict Sukhdev Yadav alisa Pehalwan in the Nitish Katara murder case and asked that it be said on oath in an affidavit. It said the govt's stand might amount to contempt of the court's order which awarded a 20-year jail term.How can a govt take such a stand? Twenty-year jail terms would become meaningless. The court had said 20-year imprisonment and now the state is saying he cannot be released even after 20 years,"" the bench said.The court was hearing a plea by Sukhdev Yadav alias Pehalwan who was sentenced to life imprisonment with a caveat that it shall be 20 years of actual imprisonment without consideration of remission. He was convicted in the 2002 Nitish Katara murder case and had filed a petition seeking furlough. As his jail term is about to get over in a few weeks, the court sought the state's response on when he could be released from jail.Senior advocate Aparajita Singh, appearing for Nitish's mother Neelam Katara, said it was a life sentence with 20 years without remission which meant that the convict could be eligible for remission after 20 years.The bench, however, was not convinced and disapproved of the state govt's stand on the issue relating to freedom. ""This is the concept of liberty for the state? We will deal with it. Let your home secretary take a stand on oath after taking legal opinion. If needed we can haul up your home secretary,"" the bench said.On Oct 3, 2016, Supreme Court had awarded 25-year jail term without any benefit of remission to Vikas Yadav and his cousin Vishal for their role in the kidnapping and killing of Nitish Katara. Co-convict Sukhdev Yadav was handed down a 20-year jail term in the case.Earlier, Delhi high court, while upholding the life imprisonment awarded to Vikas and Vishal Yadav by the trial court, had specified a 30-year sentence, without any remission, to the two. It had awarded 25-year jail term to Sukhdev Yadav.All three were convicted and sentenced for kidnapping Nitish from a marriage party on the night of Feb 16, 2002, and killing him for his alleged affair with Bharti Yadav, Vikas's sister. Bharti is the daughter of Uttar Pradesh politician D P Yadav who is in jail in connection with another murder case.","Supreme Court took exception to Delhi govt's stand that a convict, sentenced to life imprisonment with 20 years of jail term without remission, could not be released.

""The political resolution is talking about the danger of Hindutva-corporate authoritarianism going towards neo-fascism if BJP-RSS are not fought back and halted.""Unlike CPI and CPI (ML), both fiercely antagonistic towards the Sangh, CPM has all along taken an admittedly nuanced stand, with multiple political resolutions stating that the ""authoritarian and Hindutva communal attacks display emerging fascist trends"" (22nd party congress) and that the Modi govt was carrying out the ""fascist agenda of RSS"" (23rd party congress).Congress reacted sharply to the note while CPI said it couldn't understand the ""haste"" to cushion the fascist labelling of the Modi govt.""Fascist ideology teaches how religion and faith can be used for political gain and the BJP govt is implementing these in practice,"" CPI state secretary Binoy Viswam said.Leader of the opposition V D Satheesan of Congress said the CPM's assessment was part of its decision to ""align with Modi and work in subservience to the Sangh"".

BAREILLY: A drunk groom 's misstep at his own wedding in UP - in which he mistakenly garlanded his bride's best friend - set off a series of mishaps, ending with his arrest and the bride calling off the marriage.It started as Indian weddings often do - with a delay. The groom, Ravindra Kumar, 26, was late, and when he arrived, he didn't seem to be in a hurry, lingering with his friends, catching up over drinks.The 500-odd guests at a house in Naughwa Bhagwantpur village in Bareilly stayed in their seats as the bride waited. The garland-exchanging ceremony - one of those formalities that takes only a moment - was about to begin. Then, Kumar turned to the wrong woman. It was just a second. A miscalculation. But in that brief pause, before anyone could intervene, he placed the ceremonial garland over the bride's best friend.As confusion rippled through the crowd, he took the garland off and placed it around the neck of a male friend beside her. Then, to perhaps maintain a certain symmetry, he garlanded an elderly guest as well. There are moments when silence is more telling than noise. The wedding guests did not react immediately. They watched. The bride, Radha Devi, 21, did not. She slapped him and walked away. It had taken months of preparation.Omkar Verma, the bride's brother, said the family had spent over Rs 10 lakh on the wedding. He had his own theory for why things had gone wrong. ""They were unhappy with the dowry gifts. Maybe this was their way of humiliating us,"" he told TOI. ""And then we find out that he isn't even a farmer as his family told us-he's a truck driver.""At 4am, a complaint was filed at Kularia police station. By morning, the wedding was off, and Kumar was in police custody. By noon, he had apologised. His family suggested the wedding should go on. Radha refused.Circle officer Harsh Modi-used to break-ins and thefts but less accustomed to cases of misdirected garlanding-kept his summary brief. ""The groom was intoxicated. He misbehaved. His medical examination confirmed he was drunk. He was booked under sections of the Dowry Act.""","Ravindra Kumar, 26, mistakenly garlanded his bride's best friend.

""The govt supported her, and the case she filed against someone is in court, and that person in question will be punished,"" said Sharma.She added Phogat turned all of this into a political issue to make her entry into politics. ""This is my first visit to Julana. Perhaps I should have come earlier. That was a mistake.
