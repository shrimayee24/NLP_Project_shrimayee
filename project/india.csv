Indira famously championed the Swadeshi movement, often wearing Indian block prints and handloom fabrics to promote the country’s textile heritage.When asked about her thoughts during the ceremony, Priyanka said, “Yes, I remembered her [Indira Gandhi], and I also remembered my father.”Priyanka’s family members, including her mother Sonia Gandhi, brother Rahul Gandhi, and her children Raihan and Miraya Vadra, were present to witness her entry into the Parliament.Priyanka Gandhi secured the seat with a decisive margin of 4,10,931 votes, defeating Sathyan Mokeri of the Communist Party of India.

Outgoing Maharashtra CM Eknath Shinde on Wednesday said he would not be an obstacle to govt formation and would accept any decision taken by PM Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah as ""final"", thus potentially clearing the way for the return of BJP 's Devendra Fadnavis as the boss of Mantralaya in what would mark the capping stone on BJP's astounding performance under him.""I called PM Modi and Amit Shah on Tuesday and told them that your call as head of NDA and Mahayuti is final for us, just as it is final for BJP,"" Shinde said, adding, ""Our Shiv Sena will fully support BJP's decision to name the next Maharashtra CM.

They gave us the opportunity to lead the state and helped us while we were in office. They are the senior-most leaders in the NDA and Mahayuti and their decision will be considered final for us.

The decision you take is final for BJP, as it is final for us,"" Shinde said.Although the caretaker CM did not categorically state that he was conceding the CM's post to BJP nor said that he was staking claim to the top post, there has scarcely been any doubt about BJP cashing in on its fantastic poll returns to restore Fadnavis to the office he held between 2014-2019 and had looked set to retain until coalition partner Uddhav Thackeray dramatically broke away from the BJP-Sena coalition to forge the MVA combine comprising Congress and NCP.Asked if he was disappointed that he would not get a second term, Shinde said, ""There is no such thing.

Asked who the deputy CMs would be in the new cabinet, he said, ""There is a meeting in Delhi tomorrow with Amit bhai (Shah) and all related decisions will be taken there.""

There are no differences in the Mahayuti. Even before the elections, I had said all decisions will be taken together. Today, Eknath Shinde has cleared all doubts. Soon, we shall sit with our leaders and take a decision.""It was not clear whether Shinde would agree to be deputy CM under Fadnavis.

KOTTAYAM: Four doctors have been booked in Kerala’s Alappuzha after a couple lodged a police complaint saying they failed to detect abnormalities in the fetus during prenatal care, and the baby was born with severe internal and external deformities. The couple, Anish and Surumi, also submitted complaints of medical negligence to CM Pinarayi Vijayan and health minister Veena George. The health minister has ordered a special investigation, led by the additional director of the health department, into the case.The initial inquiry failed to ascertain whether the negligence occurred at govt hospital or the private diagnostic labs involved.

She was admitted to the hospital on Oct 30 for delivery, but was referred to Govt Medical College Hospital on Nov 2 due to the absence of foetal movement and heartbeat.The baby was delivered on Nov 8 and was found to have severe deformities. The couple alleged that they were not informed of any abnormalities during pregnancy. The FIR names two female gynaecologists from the Kadappuram hospital and two doctors from private diagnostic labs. The lab doctors insist their scans highlighted high fluid levels in the scans, which should have prompted further testing, while the gynaecologists gave a statement that based on the scan reports, they had informed Surumi about the possibilities of deformities.","Surumi, 35, was under treatment for her third pregnancy and at Kadappuram Govt Women and Child Hospital in Alappuzha.

NEW DELHI: Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Ajit Pawar announced plans to contest the upcoming Delhi assembly elections in a bid to reclaim the party’s national status after a resounding victory in the Maharashtra assembly elections.He declared his intent to contest Delhi assembly polls during a felicitation ceremony at the NCP office in Delhi on Thursday, where Pawar also dismissed allegations of electoral fraud raised by the opposition.Ajit Pawar outlined his vision for the NCP’s revival, saying, “We need to work harder and fight to achieve success,” he said, referencing the party’s loss of national status in April last year.He also revealed plans to hold a national convention in Delhi, marking the party’s renewed focus on expanding its influence beyond Maharashtra.Pawar also highlighted the MahaYuti alliance’s cohesiveness amid speculations of internal discord following the Maharashtra elections . “We are united. There are no differences,” he assured, adding that key alliance leaders were scheduled to meet later that day to discuss power-sharing arrangements.The MahaYuti alliance, comprising the BJP, Shiv Sena, and NCP, secured a record-breaking 235 seats in the Maharashtra elections, surpassing the Congress’s historic 222-seat victory in 1972.Addressing allegations of electronic voting machine (EVM) tampering raised by opposition parties, Pawar dismissed them as baseless. “The opposition is blaming EVMs because they didn’t get the results they wanted,” he said, pointing out that the same EVMs had facilitated victories for opposition parties in states like Punjab, Karnataka, and West Bengal.Pawar also countered calls from Congress and the NCP-SP for a return to ballot paper voting, arguing that EVMs had proven reliable in numerous elections.",Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Ajit Pawar announced plans to contest the upcoming Delhi assembly elections.

Eknath Shinde: BJP wants Shinde as deputy chief minister of Maharashtra to project message of unity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/bjp-wants-eknath-shinde-as-deputy-chief-minister-of-maharashtra-to-project-message-of-unity/articleshow/115789069.cms,"NEW DELHI: Mahayuti leaders Devendra Fadnavis Eknath Shinde and Ajit Pawar met with Union home minister Amit Shah late on Thursday here over the maharashtra govt formation. BJP is set on rehabilitating Fadnavis, something that would right the ‘wrong’ that was done to him when he was made to pay second fiddle for the party’s sake.But it is equally desirous of Shinde joining the team as deputy CM in order to project the message of unity.Although the S hiv Sena leader had said he would abide by the choice of PM Narendra Modi and Shah, BJP wants him to feel valued. “Besides, having him on its side will also help the party minimise its reliance on Ajit dada,” a source reasoned.While many argued that after serving as CM, becoming deputy CM may not be acceptable to Shinde, sources said this was not an issue in Maharashtra politics , and cited the example of Fadnavis as well as several others, including veterans. They also dismissed suggestions that having two Marathas as deputies may not go down well with voters, pointing out that the outgoing team also had two Marathas — Shinde and Ajit Pawar.“I cleared my stand in the press conference yesterday that there are no obstacles regarding CM of Mahayuti. This ‘ladla bhai’ has arrived in Delhi and the ‘ladla bhai’ is a designation higher than anything else for me. A meeting will be held on everything,” Shinde said, reiterating his position amid some of his party colleagues still staking a claim for the top post for their boss.There is recognition of the need to appoint a BJP CM given that the party bagged 132 seats in the 288-member House, and has also got the support of five more MLAs, leaving it just eight short of the majority mark on its own.As reported by TOI after the day election results were announced on Nov 23, Ajit Pawar has conveyed his support to Fadnavis, reducing the manoeuvring space for Shinde’s party. In any case, sources said the allies had jointly decided on seat allocation ahead of the polls and there was clear agreement on the issue.Amid speculation on the power-sharing formula in the Mahayuti, Shiv Sena MLA Sanjay Shirsat on Thursday said Shinde may not take up the deputy CM’s post. Shirsat said, according to him, Shinde will remain in Maharashtra politics but may not take up the dy CM’s post.“This will be a big thing. He may not take up dy CM’s post. This is my assessment. This offer can be given anytime (by BJP). They are ready, but I think Shinde may not take it up. He may take one portfolio and remain here, but I think he may not take up the dy CM’s post,” Shirsat said.","Mahayuti leaders Devendra Fadnavis Eknath Shinde and Ajit Pawar met with Union home minister Amit Shah late on Thursday here over the maharashtra govt formation.
