JAMMU: The special NIA court in Jammu has granted a 45-day extension to the probe agency to complete its probe into the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack that had left 26 people dead, most of them tourists.Additional sessions judge Sandeep Gandotra passed the order on Friday after public prosecutor (PP) Chandan Kumar Singh, appearing for NIA, told the court that the investigation was at a “crucial and sensitive stage” as key forensic and electronic reports were still awaited.The agency also sought an extension of judicial remand of two Anantnag residents, Bashir Ahmad Jothatd and Parvaiz Ahmad, who were arrested on June 22 and are currently lodged in the district jail in Jammu. The plea was also granted.The agency argued that the accused must be confronted with the forensic findings before the charge sheet is filed.Defence counsel Ashwani Kumar argued that the NIA had already been given sufficient time but had failed to establish any direct evidence against the accused.After hearing both sides, the court observed that the investigation was being carried out in a proper and professional manner and that the complexity and sensitivity of the evidence justified an extension under Section 43-D(2)(b) of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.","NIA granted 45-day extension to complete probe into April 22 Pahalgam terror attack. 26 people were killed in the attack, most of them tourists.

NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party MP Manoj Tiwari was allegedly attacked on Saturday while holding a roadshow in Bihar’s Buxar ahead of the upcoming assembly elections.Tiwari accused Rashtriya Janata Dal supporters of invading the BJP’s roadshow and attempting to chase his convoy while raising RJD slogans.“We held a roadshow in Dumraon, Buxar, and I’m shocked at how RJD supporters invaded it. RJD supporters began sloganeering. First, we were hooted at, and then someone tried to install the RJD flag on our vehicle,” Tiwari said.“When we resisted, they tried to crush us and hurled abuses. To avoid what happened in Mokama, we instructed drivers to run away quickly. However, they hit our cars with sticks, forcing us to run,” he added.He also appealed to the Election Commission to take strict action against those behind the incident.“I am appealing to the Election Commission, the administration, and Mahagathbandhan leaders — what kind of behaviour is this when contesting elections? It is a blatant crime. We have lodged a complaint and spoken to the SP. A complaint has been forwarded to the Election Commission, and strict action should be taken against those behind this incident,” the BJP MP said.This comes as Janata Dal (United) candidate from the Mokama constituency, Anant Kumar Singh, was arrested by Patna Police on Saturday night in connection with the murder of a Jan Suraaj supporter, Dularchand Yadav, Patna Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Kartikeya Sharma said.On October 30, Jan Suraaj supporter Dularchand Yadav was killed during firing between two groups while campaigning for the upcoming Bihar assembly elections in Mokama.

"EC action against Mokama poll officers for ‘negligence, dereliction of duty’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ec-action-against-mokama-poll-officers-for-negligence-dereliction-of-duty/articleshow/125028443.cms,"Anant Singh

NEW DELHI: Election Commission Saturday ordered the replacement of superintendent of police (Patna Rural) Vikram Sihag and Mokama returning officer Chandan Kumar for alleged ""negligence"" and ""dereliction of duty” in preventing the murder of Jan Suraaj Party supporter Dularchand Yadav in Bihar's Mokama assembly constituency (AC).EC directed that disciplinary proceedings be initiated Chandan Kumar, sub divisional officer of Barh & Mokama returning officer, and two sub divisional police officers (SDPOs) of Barh, Abhishek Singh and Rakesh Kumar.The poll panel also got Bihar administration to suspend three officers - SDPO Abhishek Singh, station house officers (SHO) of Bhadaur Ravi Ranjan Chauhan and SHO of Madhusudan Kumar - with immediate effect.A report sent to EC by the Bihar chief electoral officer (CEO) as well as inquiries with the concerned election observer are said to have indicted the said officers for dereliction of duty, negligence and failure to act on prior intelligence regarding likely clashes between gangs led by political strongmen or 'bahubalis'. Mokama - which goes to polls on Nov 6 - is known for being a stronghold of controversial ‘bahubalis’ who often use muscle-power to disturb the level playing field during polls and influence the electors to vote for their favoured candidate.The report states that a large number of Central forces are deployed in Patna Rural district. It said the Mokama returning officer and the sub divisional police officers in Barh were repeatedly asked to ensure maximum utilisation of the forces to maintain law and order, but they failed to do so. There was also a lapse on part of the RO in ensuring proper adherence to the model code of conduct, the report added. As regards Patna Rural SP, it was pointed out that he failed to take requisite action against the aforesaid officers after the incident.The police in a poll-bound area are required by EC guidelines to ensure depositing of all licensed arms and seizure of illegal arms, as a precautionary step against poll violence. The sensational murder in Mokama, however, points to failure on part of the police machinery there to do so, as per EC sources.Directing that the Patna Rural SP may be transferred, EC has sought a panel of officers for posting his substitute. “A compliance report in this regard may be furnished by 12 noon of Nov 2, 2025,” EC said in a letter to the Bihar CEO.The letter conveyed EC's approval for replacing Mokama returning officer Chandan Kumar with Ashish Kumar, IAS officer and additional municipal commissioner of Patna Municipal Corporation.EC also okayed Anand Kumar Singh, deputy SP (Dy-SP), CID, Patna, as Rakesh Kumar’s replacement and Ayush Shrivastava, Dy-SP, Anti-Terrorist Squad, Patna, as Abhishek Singh's substitute.Dularchand Yadav was shot dead in Mokama a couple of days back in the middle of election campaign.
