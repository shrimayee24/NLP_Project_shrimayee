NEW DELHI: BJP leader and actor Mithun Chakraborty on Thursday dismissed West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee ’s recent claims that Bengali migrant workers were being targeted in other states.Chakraborty termed the remarks as an attempt to stir unnecessary controversy and spread fear among the public.Responding to Banerjee’s concerns over the safety of Bengali-speaking migrants, Chakraborty said, “These are all lies. I opened a hotel in Bengaluru where most of the workers were Bengali migrants. There were no Bangladeshis. But if someone is Bangladeshi, they will obviously be identified as Bangladeshi.”He accused the chief minister of politicising the issue. “She wants to create controversy in everything. Nothing is going to happen. Bangla language will remain as it is. Mamata Banerjee has got no monopoly over it. We will put up a strong fight,” he said.Chakraborty also criticised Banerjee’s call to gherao the Election Commission over alleged voter list tampering in Bengal and Bihar.""She (Mamata) has no other option, but this will definitely happen. The Election Commission must act. Fake and bogus voters have to be removed, only then will elections be fair.Even if the Commission is gheraoed, what will that achieve? What’s the point (of such protests)” he added.The BJP leader’s remarks come amid heightened political tension in West Bengal, with the TMC alleging discrimination against Bengali-speaking citizens and raising concerns over the legitimacy of the electoral rolls and local entrepreneurship.",BJP leader and actor Mithun Chakraborty dismissed West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s recent claims that Bengali migrant workers were being targeted in other states.
