Why Haryana election outcome puts 'psychological' pressure back on opposition's MVA in Maharashtra,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-haryana-election-outcome-puts-psychological-pressure-back-on-oppositions-mva-in-maharashtra/articleshow/114124076.cms,"NEW DELHI: Has Haryana election results neutralised the ""psychological advantage"" which the Congress-led opposition had claimed to gain after Lok Sabha polls? Rahul Gandhi had in his recent speeches claimed that the opposition had broken PM Modi ""psychologically"", citing the fact that his government was dependent on the support of allies in Lok Sabha for survival.The Lok Sabha results had given a new impetus to the Congress offensive against the BJP and it was confident that Haryana results would reinforce its narrative of ""BJP being a party on decline."" However, the actual outcome has left the Congress stunned and also brought it under attack from its allies. And what's more, suddenly the so-called ""psychological pressure"" has shifted to the opposition ranks.The next big electoral battlegrounds are Maharashtra and Jharkhand, where assembly elections are due by the end of this year. The historic Haryana win has given the much-needed confidence boost to BJP as it gears up for the next round of state elections. The opposition, on the other hand, has its task cut out as it realises the need to return to the drawing board and reasses its strategy for the upcoming challenge.Haryana and Maharashtra may not have many things in common. But there is an uncanny similarity in how the BJP was placed vis-à-vis the opposition in both the states after Lok Sabha elections. In Haryana, the Congress had wrested five Lok Sabha seats from the BJP, while in Maharashtra the opposition bloc MVA defeated the BJP-led Mahayuti out and out. In Lok Sabha elections, BJP and allies got 17 seats while the opposition MVA of Congress, Shiv Sena (UBT) and NCP (Sharadchandra Pawar) won 30 of the 48 seats. However, the Haryana outcome has proved that a good show in Lok Sabha elections in a state may not be enough to win assembly elections in that state.Following its Lok Sabha victory in Maharashtra, the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), which comprises Congress, Uddhav Thackeray's Shiv Sena(UBT) and Sharad Pawar's NCP(SP), was quick to claim that it was the beginning of the end of Eknath Shinde government in the state. Several MVA leaders had then claimed that the people of Maharashtra would throw out the Mahayuti government in the upcoming assembly elections. But as Haryana outcome shows people of the state can vote differently in national and state elections. So, Lok Sabha advantage is no guarantee of assembly elections success.The second important learning and warning for the opposition, especially the Congress, would be to realise the importance of direct contest in defeating the BJP. The Congress, which snubbed Arvind Kejriwal's AAP in Haryana, has been under fire for being arrogant towards its allies in states where it thinks it is strong. The results show that Congress would have won at least four more seats in Haryana if it had an alliance with AAP. While it may still not have been in the position to form a government, it would have at least been saved of the accusation of being arrogant towards its allies. In Maharashtra, the MVA partners have been struggling to reach a mutually acceptable seat-sharing deal amid claims and counterclaims by the three parties based on Lok Sabha results. The Haryana results may help the allies realise the importance of staying united in their fight against the BJP-led Mahayuti. Also, the regional allies may now have an upper hand over the Congress, which would be wary of pushing too hard.Clearly, the Haryana outcome is a wakeup call for the Congress and other opposition parties, who perhaps know that they may have lost the much-touted ""psychological advantage"" after a better-than-expected Lok Sabha performance.","The next big electoral battlegrounds are Maharashtra and Jharkhand, where assembly elections are due by the end of this year.

What pulled down BJP in Pir Panjal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/what-pulled-down-bjp-in-pir-panjal/articleshow/114129008.cms,"JAMMU: BJP’s below-par performance in Pir Panjal region of Rajouri and Poonch has come under scrutiny after the party managed to win only one of the eight assembly constituencies in these two frontier districts of Jammu zone. BJP won 29 seats, all in Jammu region, in the just-concluded J&K assembly polls but faced a rout in Pir Panjal.Political observers attributed BJP’s failure in the mountainous region to the political dynamics following the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019, effects of polarisation over the Pahari quota row, and the rise in terrorist activities, despite the party’s claims of normalising the situation in the two districts sharing a border with Pakistan.While BJP secured Kalakote-Sunderbani, National Conference (NC) and Congress swept the remaining seven constituencies — Nowshera, Rajouri (ST), Budhal (ST), Thannamandi (ST), Surankote (ST), Poonch Haveli, and Mendhar (ST).BJP’s defeat is particularly striking as several top functionaries lost. The biggest upset came in Nowshera, where the party’s state president Ravinder Raina lost to NC’s Surinder Chowdhary, while general secretary Vibodh Gupta was defeated by Congress candidate Iftikhar Ahmed in Rajouri.In Budhal, BJP's former cabinet minister Chowdhary Zulfkar Ali lost to his nephew and NC candidate Javed Iqbal Choudhary. The party’s fortunes were no better in Poonch district, where the party lost all three seats.Doda-based political analyst Tariq Mehmood said BJP had high expectations in Pir Panjal region, believing its decision to grant ST status to the Pahari community would secure their votes. “BJP anticipated a clean sweep, but things went wrong. Though BJP claimed to champion the cause of tribal communities in Poonch and Rajouri, they couldn’t win voters’ confidence.”Mehmood said BJP also struggled to make inroads in Chenab valley, where it lost in Ramban and Doda. “AAP’s maiden victory in Doda poses a new challenge to both Congress and BJP,” he said.According to university student Vishal Singh from Rajouri, BJP claimed there would be no scrapping of any group’s quota, but “NC managed to create the fear among Gujjars and Bakerwals that they would lose if BJP won”.He said political signals in Pir Panjal region are influenced by its ethnic divisions. “In Rajouri, four assembly constituencies that are now part of Anantnag-Rajouri Lok Sabha seat are aligned with Kashmir. Sunderbani-Kalakote, part of Jammu parliamentary seat, leans toward Jammu politics. BJP failed to exploit these divisions.”","BJP won 29 seats, all in Jammu region, in the just-concluded J&K assembly polls but faced a rout in Pir Panjal.

Jammu & Kashmir results a victory for democracy; Haryana a befitting reply to Congress' lies: PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jammu-kashmir-results-a-victory-for-democracy-haryana-a-befitting-reply-to-congress-lies-pm-modi/articleshow/114058111.cms,"NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Tuesday launched a scathing attack on Congress and its “cronies”, accusing them of joining an international conspiracy to defame and destabilise the country and create social divisions, while following the “politics of falsehoods”.“For some time now, conspiracies are being hatched to weaken India’s democracy and social fabric.International conspiracies are being hatched. National parties like Congress and their cronies (chatte-batte) are involved in this game. Today, Haryana has given a befitting reply to every such conspiracy,” the PM said while he made a veiled reference of Rahul Gandhi, as someone born not with a silver but gold spoon being involved in the conspiracy.“Congress wants to build a nation where people hate its culture, don’t trust its institutions. Whether it is the Election Commission, defence forces, police or judiciary, Congress is trying to tarnish every institution. Till the Lok Sabha results came, they created a ruckus and even during elections , they along with allies and urban Naxal friends went up to the Supreme Court to raise doubts over the conduct of EC. Even today, Congress sought to mislead the people. Every time, they try to raise doubts over the objectivity of our institutions. It is their habit. Congress shamelessly has been doing this,” he said after the party’s historic third consecutive term in Haryana.Modi said the mandate was a befitting reply to Congress, describing it as a party that was against Dalits, OBCs and tribals.He said its leaders saw power as their birth right and behaved like a fish out of water when not in govt. “Desperate to return, they’ve resorted to spreading divisive caste politics, pitting the poor against each other. In Haryana, Congress rejected Dalit and OBC participation and openly threatened to end reservations. Their game is clear: trade the rights of the marginalised for votes,” he said.Modi said Congress aimed to weaken India by sowing discord among its people, inciting farmers and Dalits against the BJP. “Attempts to undermine our Army and youth have also failed, as Haryana’s youth rejected these divisive tactics. The message is clear: anti-national politics will not prevail. Despite ongoing conspiracies against India’s democracy, economy and social fabric, Haryana has responded decisively,” he said.He described Congress as a “parasite party”, which he said was further established after the poll verdicts in Haryana and J&K. “In the Lok Sabha polls too, most of Congress's wins came due to allies. Wherever allies trusted Congress, they sank. Congress has now become a liability, dragging down its own partners,” he said. Without naming National Conference, he added that in J&K, Congress’s partner feared it would lose seats due to the alliance. Modi said that across states, voters had rejected a second term for Congress with the last time this happened being in 2011 in Assam. In contrast, BJP had won consecutive terms in Gujarat, MP, UP and Uttarakhand with Haryana also on the list.Asserting that the unprecedented mandate will echo far and wide, the PM said, “In Haryana, development has triumphed over lies. This marks a new chapter in Haryana's political history.”Modi said after decades, J&K saw peaceful elections, with results marking a victory for India's Constitution and democracy. “While National Conference gained more seats, BJP emerged as the largest party by vote share,” he said as he extended congratulations to all winners.“Some said Kashmir would burn after Article 370’s removal, but instead, it blossomed. The massive voter turnout was heartening. For the first time, from MLAs to BDCs and DDCs, elected representatives are now shaping the future. We've restored the true spirit of the Constitution in J&K — what better tribute to Dr Babasahab Ambedkar than this?” he asked.Modi said the Haryana verdict would give a boost to efforts being taken to make India a developed country. He said farmers, youth, women and poor were the pillars of development in the country.","PM Narendra Modi accuses Congress of joining an international conspiracy to defame and destabilise the country.
