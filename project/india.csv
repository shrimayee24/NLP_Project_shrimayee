'Attempts will not go unchallenged': Rahul Gandhi accuses BJP of stoking communal tensions in Goa,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/attempts-will-not-go-unchallenged-rahul-gandhi-accuses-bjp-of-stoking-communal-tensions-in-goa/articleshow/113986082.cms,"Unrest in Goa

CM Sawant assured action against Velingkar

NEW DELHI: The Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi on Sunday accused the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of intentionally fueling communal tensions in Goa. In a post on X, he said that Goa's appeal lies in its natural beauty and the warmth and hospitality of its diverse and harmonious people. However, he claimed that under BJP rule, this harmony is being threatened.Gandhi alleged that the BJP is deliberately stoking communal tensions, with a former RSS leader provoking Christians and Sangh organisations to call for an economic boycott of Muslims.He further said that similar actions by the Sangh Parivar continue across India with impunity, backed by support from the highest levels.The response from the Congress leader comes after a controversy erupted over ex-RSS chief Velingkar allegedly called for a “DNA test” of the relics of St. Francis Xavier. Subsequently, his comments have fueled widespread anger within the Christian community in the state, prompting numerous complaints and protests.""Unfortunately, under BJP rule, this harmony is under attack. The BJP is deliberately stoking communal tensions, with a former RSS leader provoking Christians and Sangh organisations calling for an economic boycott of Muslims,"" Gandhi said in a post on X.""In Goa, the BJP's strategy is clear: divide the people while exploiting ecologically sensitive areas by illegally converting green land and bypassing environmental regulations - an assault on Goa's natural and social heritage,"" he added.He asserted that the BJP's attempts will not go unchallenged, as the people of Goa and the whole of India see through this divisive agenda and are standing united.""BJP’s attempts will not go unchallenged. The people of Goa and the whole of India see through this divisive agenda and are standing united,"" his post read.On Saturday, Margao witnessed hundreds of people from the minority community blocking roads, leading to a tense situation in South Goa. They called off the protest late at night but gave an ultimatum to the government to arrest Velingkar by 11 am on Sunday. Police detained a few people who continued to protest.In response to the continued protests by Goa's minority community over an alleged objectionable speech against St Francis Xavier by former RSS Goa chief Subhash Velingkar , CM Pramod Sawant assured that action will be taken against Velingkar.""The action which was taken against Fr Bolmax Pereira , the same action will be taken against Velingkar too. He will not be spared,"" Sawant said. The CM also requested the people not to take law and order into their hands and said that everybody will be given equal justice.Police said Velingkar has been untraceable since Friday, and multiple teams have been formed to locate him. They even pasted a notice at his residence in Panaji, instructing him to appear at Bicholim police station to join the investigation at 4 pm on Saturday, but he failed to do so.Bicholim police had registered an FIR against Velingkar on Friday after AAP MLA Velim Cruz Silva filed a complaint against him in Margao. In his complaint, Silva alleged that Velingkar, with malicious intentions, gave a maligning speech against St Francis Xavier at Bicholim on Oct 1, outraging religious feelings and insulting the religious beliefs of the entire religion.A senior police officer referred to the Fr Bolmax case, saying that an FIR was registered against him for his comments on Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, but no immediate arrest was made. Later, the FIR was quashed by the high court.",Gandhi alleged that the BJP is deliberately stoking communal tensions.

"5 nominated MLAs could be key in J&K, LG to name them",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/5-nominated-mlas-could-be-key-in-jk-lg-to-name-them/articleshow/113993087.cms,"NEW DELHI: As most exit polls have indicated a hung House in Jammu and Kashmir , all eyes are now on the five members who will be nominated to J&K assembly by the lieutenant governor Crucially, they will be nominated before the first sitting of the House and can vote, just like elected members, in a test of majority.The nominations will take the strength of the House to 95 and raise the majority mark to 48, a figure that none of the contenders are likely to reach on their own, going by exit polls.Given that the LG is a nominee of the Centre, National Conference (NC) and Congress fear he may utilise the provision to help BJP in case of a divided verdict, and have claimed that the LG can exercise powers only on the aid and advice of the chief minister. The assertion has been disputed by BJP, which argues that the law is unambiguous about nominations being the prerogative of the LG. This nomination process is mentioned in Section 15 of Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019, which was further revised on July 26, 2023.J&K assembly is modelled on the Puducherry assembly where three nominated members function at par with elected MLAs and have voting rights.Former Puducherry LG Kiran Bedi's decision to nominate two members to the UT assembly without consulting the Congress-led govt was challenged in Madras High Court and later in the Supreme Court in 2017-2018. The Puducherry govt argued that the LG ought to have consulted the CM before nominating the MLAs but the top court upheld it and found no illegality.J&K Congress vice-president Ravinder Sharma said, ""We oppose the nomination of five MLAs by the LG before govt formation. Any such move is an assault on democracy, the people's mandate and the fundamental principles of the Constitution.""However, BJP leader and former deputy CM Kavinder Gupta said, ""These members will be nominated as per the rules. The LG has discretion to nominate them and he will do it according to the rules.""","The five members will be nominated before the first sitting of the House. They will be able to vote, just like elected members, in a test of majority.

Both also emphasised that the alliance’s doors remain open to like-minded parties and politicians to keep BJP out of office.Their optimism follows exit polls suggesting an edge for NC-Congress alliance .Also, PDP candidate for Srinagar’s Lal Chowk constituency Zuhaib Yousuf Mir hinted Saturday that his party could join the coalition. “PDP will have an important role in forming any secular govt… We are ready to take any step to save the identity of Kashmir, but for this, it is important that we form a secular govt, a govt against BJP, not with them,” Mir said.Abdullah welcomed Mir’s remarks, saying: “Congratulations to them, this is a great thing, we are all on the same track. We need to end the hatred and keep Jammu and Kashmir united.” However, the former CM refrained from commenting directly on the exit polls. “I do know this much that Congress-NC alliance would be forming govt with a majority.”Karra, running from Srinagar’s Central Shalteng constituency, held a meeting with Congress candidates from Jammu region — considered a BJP stronghold. “The alliance will have a comfortable majority, and both partners shall have very good numbers,” he said, predicting that the final results would surpass the exit poll projections.With PDP suggesting it may support NC-Congress alliance in forming a govt in the event of a hung assembly, Karra said any party sharing the common goal of keeping BJP out of office in the Union territory is welcome to join the coalition.Karra was a founding member of PDP when ex-CM Mufti Mohammad Sayeed established the party in 1999. He joined Congress in 2017 after leaving PDP, now led by Mehbooba Mufti. Karra gained prominence in 2014 by defeating NC chief Abdullah in the Srinagar Lok Sabha election.These assembly elections are the first in J&K since the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019 and the region’s reorganisation into two Union territories, including Ladakh. J&K’s new assembly comprises 95 members — 90 elected and five nominated by the lieutenant governor.Commenting on the prospect of the LG nominating five MLAs, Karra warned it would amount to “rigging the poll results and defeating the people’s mandate”.

Farooq Abdullah rules out post-poll alliance with BJP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/farooq-abdullah-rules-out-post-poll-alliance-with-bjp/articleshow/113972003.cms,"SRINAGAR: National Conference (NC) president Farooq Abdullah ruled out Saturday any possibility of a post-poll alliance with BJP to form the next govt in J&K after results of the assembly elections are declared on Oct 8.Abdullah stressed that any party that aligns with BJP would “vanish” in J&K. “The vote we got here is the vote against BJP,” said the former J&K CM, whose party contested the three-phase elections (Sept 18 to Oct 1) in alliance with Congress.“The difficulties they (BJP) put the Muslims in, bulldozed their shops, houses, mosques, and schools — do you think we will go with them?” PTI quoted him as saying.“I think our people will not vote for BJP. If they (BJP) think they will form the govt, then they live in cuckoo’s world.”NC vice president and Farooq’s son Omar Abdullah echoed his father’s sentiments, saying the party would prefer to sit in opposition rather than forge an alliance with BJP. “Any kind of arrangement would ruin any party in Kashmir,” he said.The statements came in response to speculation of potential post-election alliances, particularly if neither NC nor BJP secures the required number of seats for govt formation.The elections were the first in J&K since the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019 and the region’s bifurcation into two Union territories, including Ladakh. J&K now has a 95-member assembly — 90 elected and five nominated by the lieutenant governor.PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti ’s younger daughter Iltija Mufti accused BJP-led Centre for changing rules in J&K, alleging Saturday that these moves were meant to reduce the CM’s role to that of a “glorified mayor” and leave the govt powerless.“With the LG nominating five MLAs and the chief secretary changing transaction of business rules, it’s clear that the incoming govt will be a toothless tiger… How much more will the Government of India strip J&K of any semblance of authority and autonomy? Rubber stamp CM…” Iltija wrote on X.Iltija’s remarks followed Omar’s suggestion that BJP had “accepted defeat” in J&K. “Why else would the chief secretary be assigned the duty to change (assembly’s) transaction of business rules…?” Omar asked Friday.","National Conference (NC) president Farooq Abdullah ruled out any possibility of a post-poll alliance with BJP to form the next govt in J&K.
