CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu BJP president K Annamalai on Friday whipped himself several times as a mark of protest accusing the DMK government of failing to protect the students of Anna University in Chennai.Annamalai accused the DMK government and police of leaking the victim's personal details and compromising her dignity, calling it a “shameful” act that reflected the administration’s incompetence.The BJP leader, who announced on Thursday that he would forego wearing footwear until the DMK is ousted from power, criticised the lack of CCTV surveillance at the university and questioned the state’s use of the Nirbhaya fund meant for women’s safety.“The FIR itself has exposed the victim’s identity and portrayed her in a poor light. This is a disgrace, and the DMK government must take responsibility,” he said, slamming law minister S Regupathy for defending the state’s actions.Annamalai also lambasted the police for their role in mishandling the case and demanded the removal of the Chennai police commissioner or the deputy commissioner involved. Declaring an end to public protests that often result in arrests, he urged BJP cadres to stage demonstrations at their homes.The BJP chief further announced plans to observe a 48-day fast and visit the six Arupadai Veedu (Lord Muruga’s six abodes) to “complain to Murugan” about the state’s deteriorating governance.“This kind of dirty politics leaves no room for respect or healthy debate.
