BJP manifesto a bid to wean tribal voters from JMM,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-manifesto-a-bid-to-wean-tribal-voters-from-jmm/articleshow/114926324.cms,"BJP has revised its strategy since the 2019 election, which the party lost by a significant margin

NEW DELHI: BJP's manifesto for the Jharkhand assembly polls , unveiled by home minister Amit Shah , reflects the party's hardline stance against infiltration and is also a bid to prevent consolidation of tribals in favour of CM and JMM boss Hemant Soren who has tried to whip up sympathy against his arrest in a land scam case.The manifesto also ties in with PM Narendra Modi's mantra of 'ek rahenge to safe rahenge'. The slogan 'Mati, Beti, Roti' (land, daughter, bread) alludes to the threat from illegal immigrants and fears about demographic change, which BJP strategists believe could mobilise voters in its favour.The infiltration issue has been raised by top party netas during their visits, with the expectation that it will become a central campaign theme.BJP has also aimed to reshape its image from a development-focused party to one that respects and understands Jharkhand's socio-cultural fabric.The party's commitment to implementing the Uniform Civil Code (UCC), while exempting tribal communities, might appeal to those seeking legal uniformity but could also spark controversy among tribes and other groups resistant to such changes, potentially dividing voters along cultural lines.Promises to rehabilitate those displaced by industrial and mining activities could resonate with affected communities, offering a concrete promise of welfare and justice. This could influence voting in areas where displacement has been a major concern, demonstrating BJP's intent to address historical injustices.The pledge to investigate exam paper leaks and punish those responsible could be a strategic move to appeal to the youth and educational sector, often marginalised in state politics. This might win over voters disillusioned with the ""lapses"" witnessed during the Hemant Soren dispensation.Party functionaries have also revised their strategy since the 2019 election, which they lost by a significant margin. While the 2019 manifesto touched on tribal issues, the current approach of explicitly exempting tribals from the UCC shows a more direct, nuanced engagement with tribal politics, perhaps rectifying past oversights.The intensified focus on deporting illegal immigrants and countering infiltrators, not as prominent as in 2019, indicates BJP's adaptation to the evolving political discourse in Jharkhand, where national security and demographic changes are increasingly central.","BJP's manifesto for the Jharkhand assembly polls reflects the party's hardline stance against infiltration.

NEW DELHI: After facing backlash for allegedly referring to Shiv Sena candidate Shaina NC as "" imported maal "" in the upcoming Maharashtra assembly polls , UBT faction MP Arvind Sawant claimed on Friday that he did not mention Shaina's name and said that he is the true victim of defamation . His defence came after a police complaint filed by Shaina against him at Nagpada Police Station earlier in the day.Sawant clarified that his remark was aimed at outsiders not being suitable for the local context, emphasising that Shaina is a friend he respects.""I never mentioned her name. I only said that someone who is an outsider will not be able to work here. It’s their habit to create uproar,"" he told ANI.Sawant also targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi , accusing him of being an expert in falsehoods and referencing the alleged Rs 75,000 crore irrigation scam involving NCP leader Ajit Pawar, who became Maharashtra's deputy chief minister""The PM is an expert in lying,"" Sawant said, accusing the ruling party of trying to set a false narrative and deflect attention from their weak foundation.Defending his long political career and respect for women, Sawant said his opponents are trying to malign his reputation.

The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections , which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases. The results will be declared on November 23, along with Maharashtra.In the Tribal-dominated state, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and CM Hemant's Soren Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) are in a direct fight, while the Congress party and Lalu Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) are in alliance with the JMM.The JMM-Congress-RJD alliance are also reportedly seeking to deal with Left parties, Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party and other tribal outfits that have been contesting the elections in the state as independent entities and make efforts to field candidates against the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) on all 81 seats collectively.In the last assembly polls in 2019, the JMM-Congress-RJD alliance won a comfortable majority of 47 seats in a House of 81.The BJP slipped to 25 seats from 37 it held in 2014. The poor performance was perceived to be the outcome of its decision to contest alone backfiring. The party did not foster an alliance with the Ajsu in the 2019 polls when Raghubar Das, currently the Odisha governor, was serving the state as CM.In this year's Lok Sabha polls in Jharkhand, the BJP-led NDA secured nine out of the 14 seats, with the BJP winning eight and its alliance partner, the Ajsu (All Jharkhand Students Union) Party, retaining its single seat.On the other hand, the opposition India bloc improved its tally, increasing its seat count from two in 2019 to five in the parliamentary polls.BJP and JMM have spruced up their pace of campaigning from the ground zero to social media. BJP and JMM leaders are actively rebutting and challenging each other on a range of issues, including illegal immigration, youth welfare, employment and housing.INDIA bloc parties in Jharkhand slammed the EC for holding assembly elections in the state along with that of Maharashtra but claimed that they were ready to slug it out with BJP-led NDA, which has welcomed the announcement of poll dates.JMM, Congress, and CPI (ML-L) said the announcement showed that EC was in a hurry to conduct elections though the assembly tenure was due to end in January next year.Also, both the INDIA bloc and BJP-led NDA are expected to get into huddles to discuss the modalities of seat-sharing which is going to be a challenge for both the competing teams.","The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections, which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra. Elections in Maharashtra will be held in single phase on November 20. The counting of votes will be on November 23.Maharashtra is gearing up for elections as the two major political alliances—the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) and the Mahayuti—prepare to face each other for the first time in a Vidhan Sabha election.The Maha Vikas Aghadi, comprise of the Congress, the Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray), and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) under Sharad Pawar, will go head-to-head with the Mahayuti , which includes the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Shiv Sena faction led by Eknath Shinde, and the NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar. This will be the first electoral contest between these two alliances since the splits within the Shiv Sena and NCP.The MVA is hopeful of replicating its recent Lok Sabha success, while the Mahayuti aims to retain power by leveraging its populist schemes targeted at women and youth. Both alliances have set their sights on winning the state.Narayan Rane, a former Union Minister and the victor in the Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg Lok Sabha constituency, is poised to be a key figure for the BJP in the Konkan region during the forthcoming elections. Meanwhile, two constituencies are expected to be critical battlegrounds: chief minister Eknath Shinde's Kopri-Pachpakdi seat in Thane City and Worli in Mumbai, where Aaditya Thackeray, a leader of the Shiv Sena (UBT), is seeking reelection.In the last Vidhan Sabha elections in 2019, the BJP secured 26.1% of the votes, the Congress 16.1%, the NCP 16.9%, and the Shiv Sena 16.6%. The BJP and the Shiv Sena (then united) formed the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which secured a majority. However, the coalition soon crumbled due to disagreements over government formation, plunging the state into a political crisis.After no party could establish a government, Maharashtra was placed under President's rule. Devendra Fadnavis was briefly sworn in as chief minister, with Ajit Pawar as deputy chief minister. However, both resigned just days later before a scheduled floor test.By November 28, 2019, a new coalition emerged, with the Shiv Sena (Uddhav faction), NCP (Sharad Pawar faction), and Congress forming the Maha Vikas Aghadi government, led by Uddhav Thackeray as chief minister.The state's politics took another turn in June, 2022, when Uddhav Thackeray resigned following a rebellion within the Shiv Sena, led by Eknath Shinde, who then allied with the BJP. Eknath Shinde assumed the role of chief minister, with Devendra Fadnavis returning as deputy chief minister.",The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra.
