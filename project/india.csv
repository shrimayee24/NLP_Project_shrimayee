Poll Do you think the political situation in Bihar will improve before the elections? Yes, there's potential for improvement No, it will likely worsen

Dissent rules, both in INDIA bloc and NDA



PATNA: Just a fortnight before the first phase of polling in Bihar, partners in the INDIA bloc, which seemed to be in a disarray till Sunday, appeared going into the damage-control mode on Monday with some withdrawing candidates against each other on certain seats. RJD announced its list of 143 candidates, leaving the remaining 100 for its allies. It dropped 31 MLAs and nominated new candidates. Congress has fielded candidates for 61 seats, while the Left comprising the CPI-ML, CPI and CPM announced its list of 30. On the other hand, the VIP led by former minister Mukesh Sahani has come up with its list of 15 candidates, which means the INDIA bloc partners still have some friendly contests on at least six seats.Opposition bloc leaders said they were hoping the clouds of uncertainty would clear by Oct 23, the last date of withdrawal of candidature for the second phase.Significantly, JMM withdrew from the Bihar contest after a stalemate over their seat-sharing deal with INDIA bloc. “Unfortunately, JMM won’t be part of the Bihar polls despite my intentions and plans. This is only because of RJD’s ‘political’ immaturity. Congress should have mediated to accommodate JMM, but we are sorry to say that it too did nothing,” said senior JMM legislator and state urban development minister Sudivya Kumar.There was consensus in INDIA bloc over the CM face till Monday night. Despite RJD being the largest bloc with 143 seats to its share, Congress has so far refrained from announcing Tejashwi Yadav as the CM face although he is the coordination committee chairman. Also, INDIA bloc members have not come together in a show of unity for a long time and have been speaking through the media only, adding to confusion in the opposition bloc.In seat-sharing, things looked moving in some direction when RJD didn’t announce its candidate from Kutumba seat against Congress candidate and party’s state chief Rajesh Kumar. RJD had earlier announced it would field its candidate from this seat after the conflict intensified between the two partners, in alliance for the past 35 years.On the other hand, Congress candidate Aditya Kumar withdrew his nomination from Lalganj seat on Monday, in a relief to RJD nominee. RJD had fielded Shivani Shukla, daughter of jailed strongman Munna Shukla, from this seat.In another development, VIP candidate Sakaldeo Bind withdrew his candidature from Tarapur seat in favour of RJD candidate. A visibly annoyed Bind soon resigned from the party and lent his support to BJP candidate and deputy CM Samrat Choudhary, a VIP spokesperson said.“Things are moving in the right direction and the situation will be more clear by Oct 23, the last date for withdrawal of candidature,” Congress legislature party leader Shakeel Ahmad Khan said on Monday. However, another bloc partner CPI haven’t withdrawn candidates against Congress in three seats.Initially, JMM announced to go solo after seat talks failed but suddenly on Monday urban development minister Sudivya Kumar said, “JMM won’t be part of the Bihar polls.” Kumar said, “Hemant Sorenji and JMM has always been following coalition dharma. Even when RJD had one MLA in 2019, we gave them seat in cabinet. Again now, we accommodated them. But what we got is deceit,” he said.Purnia MP Pappu Yadav, who earlier merged his party with Congress, asked the latter to break alliance with RJD on Monday, blaming the latter for not following “coalition dharma”.Things don’t look good in the rival NDA as well as former Union minister and BJP leader Raj Kumar Singh launched sharp attacks on his party for giving tickets to persons with criminal antecedents. He appealed to the people not to vote for opposition candidates such as Osama Shahab, son of RJD politician late Mohammad Anant Singh and RJD candidate from Mokama Veena Devi.","RJD announced its list of 143 candidates, leaving the remaining 100 for its allies.

Poll Do you think internal conflicts within political alliances affect voter confidence? Yes, it lowers trust No, voters focus on other factors

PATNA: The INDIA bloc continues to grapple with mounting internal friction, which is beginning to derail its election campaign in Bihar as the filing of nomination papers for the second and final phase of closes on Monday. Some seats have witnessed INDIA bloc partners fielding candidates against each other and none of them withdrew their nominations even on Sunday. Meanwhile, the RJD and Congress have so far not stepped in to quell the dispute, sending a worrying signal to voters.In contrast, the NDA campaign is in full swing. Union minister Amit Shah has returned to Delhi after a three-day tour while union minister Dharmendra Pradhan is currently camping in Bihar. The chief ministers of Goa, Haryana and Tripura have addressed rallies in various parts of the state. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will launch his Bihar poll campaign from Samastipur on Oct 24.“The INDIA bloc leaders need to sit together and tell the people that ‘we are united’ and there is no conflict among us,” Congress MP from Katihar Tariq Anwar told TOI on Sunday, acknowledging the impact of the internal discord.“But we hope everything will be over by Monday, the last date for filing nominations for the second phase. There must not be any scope for a friendly fight,” he added.Despite the mounting tension, top INDIA bloc leaders have been largely absent from the campaign trail. RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, perceived as the opposition’s CM face, remains in Patna, chalking out strategy at home, while there is no clarity on the campaign plans of Congress leaders such as leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi, party president Mallikarjun Kharge and Wayanad MP Priyanka Gandhi.However, state RJD spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan sought to downplay the concerns. “Tejashwi will embark on a poll campaign after Diwali. Every party in the INDIA bloc wants him to campaign for their candidates. Although Tejashwi has filed his nominations from the Raghopur seat, he is, in fact, contesting elections on all 243 seats of Bihar,” Gagan said.Meanwhile, denial of tickets has triggered dramatic protests across the state. Candidates have been seen rolling on the ground, tearing their kurtas, crying bitterly before the camera and threatening to teach lessons to official nominees. The chaos comes just a fortnight before the first phase of polling on Nov 6.In Patna, RJD leader Madan Shah, seeking a ticket from the Madhuban seat, broke down outside the 10,Circular Road residence of former CM Rabri Devi, tearing his kurta in despair. “Lalu ji promised a ticket from the Madhuban seat, but it was given to someone else. I will die… Can’t bear the pain,” he shouted.Another aspirant, Usha Devi, cried bitterly before the reporters outside Rabri’s residence. “I have been associated with the RJD for the past 20 years and have been the torchbearer of the party in the region, but the ticket went to someone else… This is heart-breaking, but I will still campaign for the RJD,” she said, describing RJD chief Lalu Prasad as a “father figure.”In Gopalganj, former RJD legislator Reyazul Haq Raju broke down during a live online session, expressing anguish over not receiving a party ticket while three-time Congress legislator from Kasba in Purnia district, Afaque Alam, accused party leaders of demanding money in exchange for tickets.“The state unit of Congress has now become hostage in the hands of ‘personal brokers of some leaders’. Ground-level workers who have been struggling for the party for years are being ignored for tickets while outsiders have a field day,” Alam alleged on Sunday.", INDIA bloc partners fielding candidates against each other. RJD and Congress have so far not stepped in to quell the dispute. NDA campaign is in full swing. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will launch his Bihar poll campaign from Samastipur on Oct 24.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124694439,imgsize-1418118,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

ED Arrests Ex-CM Bhupesh Baghel's Son in ₹1,000 Crore Case, Congress Cries Political Vendetta

.

NEW DELHI: Former Chhattisgarh chief minister and senior Congress leader Bhupesh Baghel on Monday said he was denied permission by the Centre to meet his son, Chaitanya Baghel, who is currently in jail.He alleged that his son’s imprisonment was politically motivated and expressed frustration over being barred from a family visit during the Diwali festival.In a post on X, Baghel shared his frustration recalling that during previous governments, family visits on festive occasions were allowed.He wrote: “Two decades ago, Chief Minister Ajit Jogi had sent Babuji to jail, but permission to meet him on Diwali had been granted. By the grace of Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, my son is in jail. Today is Diwali, but I do not have permission to meet him. I still wish everyone Diwali greetings.”Speaking to ANI reporters in Durg, Congress leader alleged that his son’s imprisonment was politically motivated and claimed he was being denied basic visitation rights usually allowed to prisoners during festivals.“My son is in jail due to the actions of Amit Shah and Narendra Modi. Prisoners are allowed to meet their families during festivals like Raksha Bandhan, Eid, and Diwali.But I am not being allowed to meet my son this Diwali,” Baghel said.He also recalled that during previous governments, such restrictions were not imposed.“Twenty years ago, when my father was in jail, the whole family met him during Diwali. But now, under PM Modi’s government, such meetings are being denied,” he added.Baghel further alleged that his family was being targeted for opposing industrial projects.“Adani was cutting down trees in Tamnar. When I protested, my son was jailed. That is the reason for his arrest,” he said.He claimed other relatives have also been prevented from visiting Chaitanya, calling it a “complete ban” on family meetings during the festival.Chaitanya Baghel was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate on July 18 in connection with an ongoing investigation into an alleged multi-crore liquor scam in Chhattisgarh.The former CM described his son’s detention as an act of political vendetta and an example of silencing dissent.","Former Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel said he was denied permission by the Centre to meet his son, Chaitanya Baghel.

CHANDIGARH: In another dramatic twist in IPS officer Y Puran Kumar’s suicide, Rohtak police on Wednesday registered an FIR of abetment to suicide and criminal conspiracy, naming all those mentioned in the final video of ASI Sandeep Kumar Lather, who allegedly shot himself on Tuesday after accusing Puran Kumar of corruption.The FIR (number 305) was registered at Sadar police station in Rohtak a few hours after Haryana CM Nayab Singh Saini visited Sandeep’s family in Ladhot village on Wednesday morning and promised justice.The FIR had not been made public at the time of filing this report, but according to highly placed sources, four persons are named in it — including the deceased IPS officer’s wife Amneet P Kumar, an IAS officer of 2001 batch, her brother Amit Rattan, who is an AAP MLA in Punjab, and head constable Sushil Kumar, who was Puran Kumar’s PSO and is now in jail remand in a corruption case.The FIR was registered under BNS sections 108 (abetment to suicide) and 61 (criminal conspiracy) on a complaint submitted by Sandeep’s wife Santosh. TOI contacted Amit Rattan but was yet to get any response till midnight.Sources say Virendra Badkhalsa, OSD to Haryana CM, informed Sandeep’s family about registration of FIR on Wednesday evening. TOI has spoken with two of the negotiators who were present when the contents of the FIR were read out to the family.Only then did Sandeep’s family agree to an autopsy. Around the same time, Puran Kumar’s body was being cremated in Chandigarh, 230km away, after eight days of stalemate.Sandeep’s body, which was so far kept in a hired freezer by the family, was taken to PGIMS Rohtak at night. Cremation will follow postmortem on Thursday morning, said sources in the family.Sandeep was part of the team that was investigating the case allegedly involving Puran Kumar, and was also involved in the arrest of Puran Kumar’s former PSO on Oct 5.It was this FIR, registered on Oct 6, that’s alleged to be the trigger for Puran Kumar’s suicide as Sushil was alleged to have given a statement that he was demanding money on behalf of Puran Kumar, who was then Rohtak IG.Haryana govt found itself battling on two fronts. Amneet and other members of the family had refused to allow autopsy until action was taken against DGP Shatrujeet Kapur and then Rohtak SP Narendra Bijarniya, who were among those named by Puran Kumar in his suicide note. Bijarniya was transferred on Oct 10 and Kapur was sent on leave on Monday midnight.Less than 12 hours after Kapur was sent on leave, Sandeep shot himself after releasing a final video in which he called Kapur honest and accused Puran Kumar of corruption. In the video, he said Puran Kumar’s suicide was due to “humiliation from corruption charges” and had “nothing to do with caste issues”.Sandeep’s family took away his body, kept it in a freezer in Ladhot, and refused to allow autopsy or cremation until an FIR was registered against all those he had named in the video and his four-page suicide note.The Haryana CM, accompanied by ministers Krishan Lal Panwar and Mahipal Singh Dhanda, rushed to the village on the outskirts of Rohtak on Wednesday morning to console the family. Sandeep’s sisters tearfully asked Saini what was their brother’s fault, and pleaded for justice, said a source.The CM assured the grieving family that appropriate action would be taken, and justice would be delivered.Apart from the FIR, the family wanted a job for a relative and financial assistance, to which govt agreed.","Haryana CM Nayab Singh Saini visited Sandeep Kumar Lather's family in Ladhot village on Wednesday morning and promised justice.

‘Purification’ over namaz at Pune Shaniwarwada: ASI officer files plaint against 3 women; NCP demands case on BJP MP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/pune-allies-criticise-bjp-mp-medha-kulkarni-over-purification-after-namaz-ncp-seeks-police-action/articleshow/124712949.cms,"‘Purification’ protest: NCP & Sena criticise Medha Kulkarni

PUNE: BJP’s alliance partners NCP and Shiv Sena on Monday came down heavily on its Rajya Sabha MP Medha Kulkarni for leading a protest and ‘purifying’ the site at Shaniwarwada where a group of Muslim women recently offered namaz. The NCP, which is led by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, demanded that a police case be filed against her for trying to disturb communal harmony.Members of NCP’s Pune city unit held a protest against Kulkarni outside Shaniwarwada on Monday. NCP spokesperson Rupali Thombare, who led the agitation, said, “There was no need for Kulkarni to protest over some Muslim women offering namaz in Shaniwarwada.”The video was filmed around 1.45pm on Saturday and was shared on social media handles. It triggered a protest by Kulkarni and members of other rightwing outfits, prompting the police to deploy bandobast around the historic monument. Kulkarni and others performed a ‘purification’ of the historic wada.NCP spokesperson Rupali Thombare said, “She [Medha Kulkarni] claims that the sentiments of Hindus were hurt, but I want to tell her that we are also Hindus, and our sentiments were not at all hurt as we believe in inclusivity.In fact, a case should be filed against her for disturbing the peace and harmony of Pune.”The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s other Mahayuti partner, Shiv Sena, also criticised Kulkarni’s action.Deputy chairperson of the Legislative Council and senior Shiv Sena member Neelam Gorhe said that while Muslim women should have avoided offering prayers at a site which is under Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), nobody should take the law into their hands.“If the rules are violated, there are authorities like the police commissioner or a collector to take action against those people. Some people should not behave as if they are running the entire govt,” Gorhe added.An officer of the Archaeological Survey of India, Ishwar Kawade, who is a resident of Ghorpadi, lodged a complaint with the police.The police have not yet identified the three women who offered prayers at the site.Visitors make online payments at the entrance gates to buy entry tickets and the server is in the ASI’s Delhi office. “Our team will visit Delhi, if needed, to ascertain the identity of these women,” a senior officer said on condition of anonymity.","Rajya Sabha MP Medha Kulkarni led a protest and ‘purifying’ the site at Shaniwarwada where a group of Muslim women recently offered namaz.

Bihar Polls: RJD Announces Candidate List for Bihar Elections, 143 Contenders

RANCHI: Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), which is running an alliance govt in the state, on Monday withdrew from Bihar assembly elections after a stalemate over their seat-sharing deal with INDIA bloc partners.The decision comes two days after the party announced it will go solo and notified six seats for fielding candidates but kept the window open for reconciliation with allies RJD and Congress An hour after the second phase of nomination ended on Monday, senior JMM legislator and state urban development minister Sudivya Kumar accused RJD and Congress of ‘misleading’ and ‘duping’ JMM and announced the withdrawal.“Unfortunately, JMM won’t be part of the Bihar polls despite my intentions and plans. This is only because of RJD’s political immaturity. Congress, being a key alliance of INDIA bloc, should have mediated to accommodate JMM in Bihar elections, but we are sorry to say that it too did nothing,” said Kumar.“While the outcome of Bihar polls is still to be seen with weakened INDIA bloc sans JMM, the way JMM and its workers were humiliated today, there will certainly be repercussion in Jharkhand’s politics in coming days,” he said.On why JMM didn’t go ahead with nominations despite announcing to go solo two days ago, he said that as part of the coalition dharma, they expected RJD, which is the biggest party of INDIA bloc, would reciprocate the way we did them in Jharkhand.“Now, JMM won’t be part of any political activities for Bihar polls,” he said, reminding both RJD and Congress how on their request chief minister and JMM president Hemant Soren had attended Rahul Gandhi’s Vote Adhikaar Yatra’s concluding rally in Bihar.“Hemant Sorenji and JMM has always been following coalition dharma. Even when RJD had one MLA in 2019, we gave them seat in cabinet. Again now, we accommodated them. But what we got is deceit,” he said.In 2020 Bihar polls too, JMM was promised three seats, but later, Congress and RJD backtracked and distributed among themselves.JMM leaders including party general secretary Vinod Pandey on Oct 7 had a detailed discussion with RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav and others in Patna on seat-sharing deal.During that meeting, JMM presented a list of 28 seats where tribals play a crucial role and how JMM can make a difference to stop BJP (NDA) on these seats.Of 28, RJD remained second on 27 seats in last elections, JMM said. “With JMM on board, there was possibility of a good show this time,” Roy added.","Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), which is running an alliance govt in the state, on Monday withdrew from Bihar assembly elections.
