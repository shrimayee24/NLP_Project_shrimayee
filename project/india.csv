AGRA: Ex-Army jawan Manoj Kumar , 50, was sentenced to death by a court in Aligarh on Saturday for the murder of his wife Seema Devi , 38, son Manvendra Singh , 6, and neighbour Shashibala, 40, in 2014. The court relied heavily on the testimony of the convict’s 13-year-old daughter, Usimita Singh, who was critically injured in the incident, ADGC Mape Singh said.On July 12 that year, after a verbal spat with his wife, Manoj, in a fit of rage, took out a rifle and a revolver from his cupboard and shot her in the chest. Hearing gunshots, their neighbour Shashibala rushed in and the ex-Army jawan shot her in the head. Manoj then targeted his children. Manvendra, terrified by the gunshots clung on to his legs, pleading to spare his life, but he was also shot in the head. All three died. His daughter, a student of Class 8, was shot in the face but survived to narrate the horrific details before the court.Manoj was overpowered by neighbours and handed over to the police, and Seema’s brother Dilip Kumar later filed a complaint at Banna Devi in Aligarh.In his police complaint, Dilip stated that he was about to visit his sister’s place when he noticed a lot of commotion on the road. Soon, he came to know that Manoj had “attacked several people”. When he stepped into the house, Dilip saw his brother-in-law shooting at the 13-year-old girl. He further stated that Manoj was ill-tempered and used to often beat his wife and children. Police registered a case against the ex-Army man under IPC sections 302 (murder) and 307 (attempt to murder).","Manoj Kumar was sentenced to death by a court in Aligarh for the murder of his wife Seema Devi, 38, son Manvendra Singh, 6, and neighbour Shashibala, 40, in 2014.

NEW DELHI: The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Saturday claimed that former Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal was attacked during his campaign in the New Delhi constituency. The incident has sparked a political war of words between the AAP and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).AAP shared a video on social media alleging that BJP candidate Parvesh Verma ’s supporters attacked Kejriwal's convoy with bricks and stones. The party claimed that the attackers attempted to injure Kejriwal to hinder his campaigning efforts. The accompanying post said in Hindi, ""BJP people, Kejriwal ji is not going to be scared of your cowardly attack, the people of Delhi will give you a befitting reply.""Addressing the incident, AAP national spokesperson Priyanka Kakkar said, ""Today again BJP goons attacked Arvind Kejriwal, who was campaigning in New Delhi Vidhan Sabha, with stones.

He said, ""All the allegations of AAP National Convenor Arvind Kejriwal are baseless.""He further alleged that during Kejriwal's door-to-door campaign near Lal Bahadur Sadan, three unemployed youths—Vishal, Abhishek, and Rohit—attempted to question Kejriwal about issues like employment. According to Verma, ""Punjab Police beat them up, broke a worker's phone, and Kejriwal’s car hit the three youths. The driver applied brakes, but Kejriwal signaled the driver to crush them. This is an attempt to murder.""Verma claimed the three youths were injured. Speaking to reporters, he said, ""The car of Arvind Kejriwal has gone ahead by crushing the worker of the BJP. The leg of the worker has broken, and I am going to the Lady Hardinge Medical College to inquire about his health. This is very shameful."" He added, ""A case of attempt to murder will also be registered.""Verma further said, ""All the three injured are residents of this assembly constituency, and they were hit by the car of AAP National Convenor Arvind Kejriwal.

Poonawalla accused AAP of fabricating incidents to gain sympathy and divert attention from their failures. ""The way Arvind Kejriwal drove his car over three youths shows his mindset and the desperation within AAP. This incident is nothing but a 'sponsored attack' staged by AAP to play the victim card. It’s an old habit of theirs—they create drama to avoid answering real questions from the people. Instead of addressing unemployment and governance failures, they resort to theatrics and violence,"" he said.Poonawalla further claimed that the incident highlights AAP’s disregard for the rule of law. ""This is the same party that thrives on anarchy. When cornered by public scrutiny, they orchestrate such events to shift the narrative. The truth is that AAP has no answers for their broken promises, and now they’re trying to pin the blame on us. The people of Delhi are watching, and they will respond through the ballot box,"" he added.BJP MP Bansuri Swaraj, after meeting the three youths allegedly injured by the car of Kejriwal, launched a scathing attack on the Delhi Chief Minister. The incident has intensified the war of words between the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) amid the ongoing New Delhi assembly campaign.Swaraj claimed that the injured individuals, now undergoing treatment, were seen in wheelchairs. ""AAP's National Convenor Arvind Kejriwal hit them with his car with ruthlessness and cruelty. This is an example of petty politics and shows he is afraid of his defeat,"" she said.The BJP MP accused Kejriwal of avoiding accountability and failing to fulfill his promises. She questioned the credibility of his claims of feeling threatened by three youths, given his constant security provided by the Punjab Police. ""How can the VVIP who is always guarded by Punjab Police get frightened by three youths?"" Swaraj asked.Highlighting the gravity of the incident, Swaraj added, ""The party will take whatever criminal action needs to be taken.""In retaliation, AAP MP Sanjay Singh alleged that BJP wanted to win the elections through hooliganism.Speaking to the media, Singh said, ""They are attacking Arvind Kejriwal with stones. Parvesh Verma's people attacked him with stones. You want to win the elections by hooliganism. The workers and leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party have never bowed down before you. Why do they do such cowardly acts? What will they achieve by this? BJP is a party of cowards, and I strongly condemn it.""Congress candidate from the New Delhi Assembly, Sandeep Dikshit, also condemned the incident but criticized both AAP and BJP for not addressing core public concerns. ""We condemn this; violence has no place in democracy. I hope the police will investigate, and only then will it be known what kind of attack it was. Violence should not happen. I hope the police will provide Kejriwal with more security. However, both parties (AAP and BJP) do not talk about the real issues,""Authorities have not yet verified the details of the incident.

It has recommended reforms to ensure that the PM can face a no-confidence motion in parliament.To prevent the concentration of power in the hands of an individual or institution, it has proposed the creation of a constitutional body - national constitutional council (NCC) - to establish a system of checks and balances between the three branches of the state and the two executive positions - PM and president.This council would include the president, chief justice, PM, leaders of opposition of both houses, speakers and deputy speakers from the opposition, and a representative of other parties. The commission has recommended decentralising the judiciary by maintaining the unitary structure of Supreme Court, while establishing permanent high court benches with jurisdiction in all divisional cities.It has also provided a framework for an interim govt to be formed after the dissolution of parliament, and recommended that selection of advisers to such govts should be solely the NCC's responsibility.",The Constitution Reform Commission has recommended introducing a two-term limit on the PM's tenure.

Khaleda and her son are currently residing in London.SC overturned the judgments delivered during the regime of ousted PM Sheikh Hasina by the high court and trial court. The trial court had sentenced Khaleda to five years' imprisonment, while Tarique and the other accused received 10 years each. Later, HC doubled Khaleda's sentence to 10 years while upholding trial court's verdict for the other accused.In its ruling, SC observed that the prosecution of the Zia Orphanage Trust case was ""malicious"" and noted that the accused, who did not appeal the HC verdict, would also benefit from this judgment ""restoring their dignity as innocent individuals"".A five-member bench of the appellate division, led by Chief Justice Syed Refaat Ahmed, delivered the unanimous verdict. The ruling came after hearings on two appeals filed by Khaleda and individual appeals made by Kazi Kamal and businessman Sharafuddin Ahmed. Khaleda had initially been jailed on Feb 8, 2018 after a special court in Dhaka sentenced her to five years in prison for her involvement in the case.
