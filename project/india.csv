Midnight Drama Over VB-G RAM G Bill, Opposition Stage Overnight Protest, Sleep Outside Parliament

NEW DELHI: BJP MPs Nishikant Dubey and Sanjay Jaiswal have filed a ""breach of privilege and contempt"" notice against several opposition members and urged Speaker Om Birla for disciplinary action against them for ""continuously obstructing"" the House's proceedings when rural development minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan was piloting the G RAM G BillOfficial sources said Birla is examining the matter. The Speaker was critical of the excessive disruption by several MPs, some of whom reached the table of Lok Sabha officials in an attempt to disrupt proceedings, on Wednesday.Dubey named Hibi Eden, Dean Kuriakose, S Murasoli, K Gopinath, Sashikant Senthil, Shafi Parambil, S Venkateshan and Jothimani, all from different opposition parties, in his notice.In his letter to Birla, he accused them of continuously obstructing the smooth functioning of the House by creating obstructions for Chouhan and the officers assisting the House.""As such, this is misconduct in the presence of House, disobedience to the authority of Speaker, obstructing officers of the House in discharge of their duties which is clearly a breach of privileges of Members of Parliament collectively and the contempt of the House,"" he added.He urged Birla to take ""strict action"" against against the opposition MPs ""so that in future this kind of incidents do not re-occur"".When Chouhan was responding to the debate, opposition members rushed to the Well of the House, tore copies of the Bill and stood on tables to register their protest against the provisions of the rural job guarantee Bill, which will replace the 20-year-old Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA).The Speaker's office is also examining the opposition's notice for removal from office of Madras high court Judge GS Swaminathan and also the complaint filed against a TMC MP for vaping inside Lok Sabha even as e-cigarette is banned across the country.As the session came to an end, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju lauded this sitting of Parliament as a milestone in PM Narendra Modi's push for ""reform express"", highlighting the passage of some key legislations covering rural employment, insurance and nuclear energy.He also blamed the opposition for the absence of discussion on air pollution in Delhi-NCA, claiming that the govt was keen for it but Congress wanted to continue with loud protest against the Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) (VB-G RAM G) Bill and persuaded other opposition parties as well.Rijiju, however, termed the session as ""very productive"" as eight bills were passed after debates in both Houses. These legislations will ""speed up"" the 'reform express' flagged off by Modi to bring improvement in the everyday life of the common people. The reform express will continue, he added.""But the opposition's behaviour during the debate in Lok Sabha on Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) (VB-G RAM G) Bill was unacceptable. Some of the opposition members even stood atop the desks of the table office and (Lok Sabha) secretary general. Some Congress members also conveyed that there was no need for a debate on pollution. That is why the issue could not be taken up for discussion,"" he said.In Lok Sabha, Birla noted that the House's productivity topped 111% and was marked by a marathon discussion of over 11.30 hours to commemorate 150th anniversary of Vande Mataram.","BJP MPs Nishikant Dubey and Sanjay Jaiswal have filed a ""breach of privilege and contempt"" notice against several opposition members.

Vaping, Bhow-Bhow & Shouting Match: A Look At Viral Moments Of Parl As Chaotic Winter Session Ends

BARUIPUR (WEST BENGAL): An FIR has been registered against BJP leader and National In-Charge of the party's IT Cell, Amit Malviya, at the Narendrapur Police Station under the Baruipur Police Station, alleging that his social media post threatened communal harmony and the sovereignty of India.According to the complaint received on Friday by Narendrapur Police Station, All India Trinamool Congress leader and State General Secretary and Spokesperson Tanmoy Ghosh accused Malviya of posting an ""incendiary statement"" on the social media X platform on December 19. The complaint references a specific post, claiming it amounted to ""formal instigation against communal harmony"" and posed a ""substantial threat"" to the country's sovereignty.The complainant further alleged that the post constituted a direct insult to West Bengal, the All India Trinamool Congress (AITC), and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee . The letter urged the police to initiate strict legal action against the BJP leader under relevant sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) and any other applicable laws.Police sources confirmed that the complaint had been received and acknowledged by Narendrapur Police Station.However, officials said no FIR has been registered to date and that the matter is under preliminary examination.Further action, officials said, will be taken after the complaint and the social media post in question are reviewed.In the X post against which the FIR was filed, Amit Malviya stated that the ongoing vandalism in Dhaka, Bangladesh, was a ""warning"". He noted that this is ""how societies unravel when extremism is appeased, and lawlessness is normalised."" In reference to incident, he stated that, ""It is also why the trajectory of West Bengal under Mamata Banerjee is deeply worrying."" In the end, he said, ""Culture, free expression, and democracy cannot survive where mobs rule, and the state looks away. ""The X post stated, "" Last night, Islamist mobs vandalised Chhayanaut Bhavan, a historic institution and a cornerstone of Bengali arts and culture in Dhaka. The pattern unfolding in Bangladesh is unmistakable: attacks on media houses, journalists, and cultural centres, carried out under Islamist pressure and intimidation. This is a warning. This is exactly how societies unravel when extremism is appeased, and lawlessness is normalised. It is also why the trajectory of West Bengal under Mamata Banerjee is deeply worrying. Years of political patronage, erosion of institutions, and selective silence have pushed Bengal onto a dangerous path. If Mamata Banerjee's decrepit regime continues beyond 2026, the consequences for Bengal will be irreversible. Culture, free expression, and democracy cannot survive where mobs rule, and the state looks away.""The development adds to the ongoing political tensions between the ruling Trinamool Congress in West Bengal and the Bharatiya Janata Paty, with leaders from both sides frequently trading accusations over social media conduct and alleged attempts to disturb communal peace, as the West Bengal elections in 2026 approach.Further details awaited.

'We Are United...Will Go To Delhi If High Command Calls': Siddaramaiah, Shivakumar After Meeting

NEW DELHI: Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah on Friday dismissed claims of a two-and-a-half-year “power-sharing arrangement” within the state government.Facing repeated questions from the Opposition over his tenure on the last day of the Legislative Assembly session in Belagavi, Siddaramaiah said there was no such agreement in place and made it clear that he would remain the CM until the party high command decides otherwise.“First, the people must bless us. Then the legislators elect the leader in the Legislative Party meeting, and after that, the high command decides. That is all I have said. Even now, I am the Chief Minister, and I will remain the Chief Minister until the high command decides otherwise,” he said.Reacting to Siddaramaiah’s remarks, BJP MLA and Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly, R Ashoka, questioned the claim, saying, “You were elected for five years by the Legislative Party. What about 2.5 years?”Siddaramaiah responded, “I never said anything about two and a half years. There is no such agreement as two and half years.”Earlier this week, the CM reiterated that he would complete his full term. “We will complete the full term and return to power in 2028...I’m the CM till the high command says,” Siddaramaiah said.Speculation over a possible change in leadership, with Karnataka deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar taking over the CM seat in January gained momentum over the past few days. The Congress later sought to put the rumours to rest after Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar met for breakfast at each other’s residences and addressed the media together to project party unity.DK Shivakumar also dismissed speculation surrounding a reported dinner meeting. “Who said? There was no dinner meeting or anything. I had gone for a dinner to my former DCC president to pay respect, they contributed a lot to Karnataka, Belgavi. So to honor them, I went along with my friends. There is no other politics,” he said.",Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah dismissed claims of a two-and-a-half-year “power-sharing arrangement” within the state government.

Interpol Blue Notice Explained: How CBI Tracks Absconding Luthra Brothers In Goa Nightclub Fire Case

NEW DELHI: Advocate Vishnu Joshi, representing a victim’s family in the Goa nightclub fire case, on Wednesday said that one of the Luthra brothers requested a Dunlop mattress during police remand.Joshi explained that the court carefully considered the brothers’ health claims before granting custody. Speaking to reporters, he said, “Today, when the Goa Police presented them in court, one accused, during their arguments, claimed he had spinal issues and other health problems. He requested that they be provided with a Dunlop mattress during their police remand. The state strongly opposed this... Their pre-medical examination showed them to be perfectly fit. ”He added that the duo had attempted to evade legal proceedings since fleeing India.“Since these people (Luthra brothers) absconded and fled the country, they have been employing tactics to somehow escape. First, they filed an anticipatory bail application on vague grounds in the Rohini Court, even though that court had no jurisdiction... But that bail application was rejected. Since then, they have been trying wherever they get a chance to obtain some kind of relaxation,” Joshi said.Joshi explained that the court carefully considered the brothers’ health claims before ordering custody.“The brothers claimed to be suffering from back pain. The court considered all submissions and directed the police to first conduct a pre-medical examination and re-examination. No medical necessity was found, following which the court, exercising its full authority, granted five days of police remand,” he said.The Luthra brothers, owners of the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub in Arpora, were remanded to five-day police custody by the Mapusa Judicial Magistrate First Class (JMFC) court.They were brought back to Goa from Thailand following their deportation and produced before the court after undergoing multiple medical examinations.After landing at Manohar International Airport, Mopa, under police escort around 10.45 am, the duo was taken to a primary health centre in Siolim and then to the District Hospital in Mapusa. The court directed fresh medical examinations before ordering the five-day custody to allow investigators to question them regarding alleged safety lapses at the club.The blaze broke out on December 6 around 11.45 pm during a crowded event at the nightclub, when electric firecrackers allegedly struck the wooden ceiling. The incident claimed the lives of 25 people, including tourists and staff, while several others were injured.Police said the brothers fled India hours after the incident on December 7, leaving for Thailand while rescue operations were under way. Goa Police launched a nationwide and international manhunt, issued a lookout circular and sought an Interpol Blue Notice.Following their detention by Thai authorities for illegal stay and the suspension of their passports, the brothers were deported to India on emergency travel documents.They landed at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport on Tuesday and were arrested by Goa Police, who obtained a 48-hour transit remand from a Delhi court to facilitate their return to Goa.They have been booked under several provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, including culpable homicide not amounting to murder and negligence. Investigators have also arrested several others linked to the nightclub’s operations and are probing allegations that the venue was operating with expired licences and without mandatory safety clearances.","Advocate Vishnu Joshi, representing victim's family, says one of the Luthra brothers requested a Dunlop mattress during police remand.

National Herald Case: Court Declines To Act On ED Chargesheet, Congress Claims Truth Has Prevailed

NEW DELHI: The Enforcement Directorate on Friday moved the Delhi High Court against a trial court order that refused to take cognisance of its prosecution complaint against Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi in the National Herald money laundering case.The move follows a Delhi court order passed on Tuesday. The court declined to take cognisance of the ED’s prosecution complaint, which is equal to a police charge sheet.In a 117-page order, Special Judge Vishal Gogne held that the ED probe was “impermissible in law” as it was not based on a first information report (FIR). An FIR is required to begin an investigation under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).The judge ruled that an investigation and the related prosecution complaint for money laundering cannot stand without an FIR.The court, however, allowed the ED to continue its investigation based on an FIR registered by the Delhi Police’s economic offences wing on October 3. The agency brought this FIR to the court’s notice during the hearing.The court also rejected the Gandhis’ request for a copy of the police FIR.It said they were not entitled to it at this stage of the investigation.The judge also examined how the case began. He noted that “in the present origin of the allegations, a public person, namely Subramanian Swamy, instituted the complaint under Section 200 of the CrPC (Code of Criminal Procedure). He is not a person authorised to investigate the offence mentioned in the schedule (Section 420 of IPC)”.Based on these findings, the court said, “It is now premature and imprudent for the court to decide the submissions made by ED as well as the proposed accused in relation to the merits of the allegations.”The case relates to the acquisition of Associated Journals Limited (AJL), which published the now-defunct National Herald newspaper.",The Enforcement Directorate has moved the Delhi High Court against a trial court order.
