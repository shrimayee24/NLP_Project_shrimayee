'I will first ... ': What Sharad Pawar said on welcoming back estranged nephew Ajit into party fold,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/i-will-first-what-sharad-pawar-said-on-welcoming-back-estranged-nephew-ajit-into-party-fold/articleshow/111815583.cms,"Sharad Pawar's 'aastha' dig at former party leader Bhujbal

NEW DELHI: Sharad Pawar is back with a bang. Almost a year after he lost control of his Nationalist Congress Party following a rebellion led by his estranged nephew Ajit Pawar , the Maratha strongman is once again on the centrestage of Maharashtra politics.The recent surprise visit of Maharashtra minister and NCP leader Chhagan Bhujbal , who had sided with Ajit Pawar after last year's rebellion, and the return of several NCP leaders into his party fold have come as a boost to the veteran leader, who led his party to its best-ever performance in the national elections.It was on July 2 last year that Ajit Pawar carried out a meticulously planned coup that left his uncle Sharad Pawar surprised and isolated. He joined the Eknath Shinde-led NDA government as the ""national president"" of Nationalist Congress Party displacing Sharad Pawar, who founded the party in 1999. Ajit Pawar walked away with majority of MLAs and eventually also got the name and symbol of the party.A year later, the wheel of fortune has turned full circle and today Ajit Pawar stands isolated in the BJP-led Mahayuti after a disastrous Lok Sabha show. What's worse, the RSS has repeatedly pointed to BJP 's mistake in aligning with Ajit Pawar.So, is Sharad Pawar is ready to let bygones be bygones and welcome back Ajit Pawar if he decides for homecoming?When asked about the possibility of taking back his nephew, Sharad Pawar made it clear that he would first consult all his (party) colleagues who stood with him before taking any step in this matter.Ajit Pawar faces a tense future in the ruling Mahayuti. His party's demand for a Cabinet minister berth for senior leader Praful Patel was ignored by the BJP. As the ruling party gears for the assembly elections later this year, Ajit Pawar knows that he faces an uphill task to regain the lost ground.Sharad Pawar also took a dig at NCP leader and minister Chhagan Bhujbal over his unscheduled visit to the NCP (SP) chief's residence recently.""I was resting because I was unwell when Bhujbal visited me. I was told that Bhujbal had been waiting for me for one hour and was not ready to go without meeting me,"" Pawar said.""Bhujbal's recent remarks about me in a couple of speeches showed that he had tremendous 'aastha' (faith) in me,"" Pawar said sarcastically, indirectly referencing Bhujbal's remarks at a rally held on Sunday.Bhujbal had claimed Maha Vikas Aghadi leaders backed out from attending an all-party meeting convened by the government at the last minute after receiving a ""phone call from Baramati"", alluding to Pawar.",Maratha strongman Sharad Pawar is once again on the centrestage of Maharashtra politics.

'We all like her for this': What Chirag Paswan said on fellow MP Kangana,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/we-all-like-her-for-this-what-chirag-paswan-said-on-colleague-kangana/articleshow/111810531.cms,"NEW DELHI: Speaking about his Parliament colleague and Mandi MP Kangana Ranaut, Union minister Chirag Paswan said most of the time she is ""not very politically correct but that's her USP"".In an interview with news agency ANI when asked if Kangana could make a difference, Chirag Pawas said, ""One thing I know for sure is that most of the time she is not politically correct, but that's her USP.She knows what to speak...when to speak. If it's politically correct or not is debatable.""""I think we all like her for this,"" said Paswan, an important ally in the BJP-led NDA.Kangana Ranaut, who entered politics and contested Lok Sabha polls on BJP's ticket from Himachal's Mandi, was Chirag's co-star in the Bollywood movie Miley Naa Miley Hum released in 2011.BJP's Mandi MP was recently in news last month after a woman CISF constable slapped her at the Chandigarh airport.The incident took place at around 3:30 pm when Kangana was about to board a flight to Delhi. Hours after the incident, the BJP leader released a video confirming the incident and linked it to rising extremism and terrorism in Punjab. Later, the CISF constable was suspended.Kangana secured a resounding victory over Congress candidate Vikramaditya Singh, with a margin of 74,755 votes. She garnered a total of 5,37,022 votes in the election.Chirag Paswan, the president of LJP (Ram Vilas), established himself as the true political successor of his late father, Ram Vilas Paswan , after a three-year struggle.By winning all the five LS seats his party was allotted in the NDA alliance, Chirag has not only maintained LJP's previous track record of keeping 100% strike rate but also established that he is the new Dalit icon on the political landscape of Bihar.",Kangana Ranaut was Chirag Paswan's co-star in the Bollywood movie Miley Naa Miley Hum released in 2011.

NEW DELHI: The West Bengal unit of the BJP has announced that they will not follow the party's ideal of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas' any more as they did not need any ""minority morcha"" in the state. This despite the fact that the idea of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas' has been the cornerstone of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's governance policies for an inclusive India for over 10 years now.West Bengal BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari , who is also the leader of opposition in the state assembly, on Wednesday said that the party will not talk about nationalist Muslims any more and will instead follow the principle of ""Jo Hamare Saath, Hum Unke Saath.""At BJP state executive meeting in Kolkata, Adhikari said ""I had spoken about nationalist Muslims and you too had said 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas'.But I will not say this anymore. Instead, we will now say, 'Jo Hamare Saath, Hum Unke Saath'. Stop this 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas'. Minority Morcha is not needed.""""The fight is on and the fight will continue. We will continue to fight together to save Hindus and save the Constitution,"" Adhikari said as he tried to enthuse party cadres.Suvendhu Adhikari, despite his all-out attack against chief minister Mamata Banerjee and the Trinamool Congress government, has failed to deliver results. In the Lok Sabha elections, the BJP was reduced to 12 seats from the 19 it had won five years ago in 2019. In the just-concluded byelections also, the BJP lost all the four assembly seats to the ruling Trinamool Congress.With his remarks triggering a row, Suvendu Adhikari later issued a clarification and said that his statement was being taken out of context.""I am clear that those who are Nationalists, stand for this Nation and Bengal, we should be with them. Those who don’t stand with us, work against the interest of Nation and Bengal, we need to expose them. Also, like Mamata Banerjee, we shouldn’t divide people in majority and minority and see them as Indians. I embody in letter and spirit, Prime Minister’s call for Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas, Sabka Prayas,"" the West Bengal leader of opposition wrote in a post on X.","The West Bengal unit of the BJP has announced that they will not follow the party's ideal of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas' any more.

"Every section of society is hurting, says Rahul Gandhi",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/every-section-of-society-is-hurting-says-rahul-gandhi/articleshow/111818325.cms,"NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi Wednesday said that every section of society is hurting from issues like inflation or unemployment or govt indifference, and he will fight from streets to Parliament to secure them justice - the remark in the runup to the budget session raising prospects of an aggressive opposition stance in the Parliament.In social media posts accompanied by videos of his recent interactions with daily labourers and loco pilots, Rahul said, ""Today in India, everybody from daily wagers to govt employees are hurting badly, some because of inflation and lack of jobs, and others because of govt indifference.I will raise my voice in favour of everybody, will get them justice - from streets to Parliament.""Since he became the leader of the opposition in Lok Sabha, Rahul has posted videos outlining his responsibility with the promise that he will use the floor of Parliament to raise concerns of the common man .With the brief inaugural session witnessing an aggressive opposition taking on the govt, the coming Budget session is key to BJP and the rivals alike. Sources said the priority would be the discussion on the budget. Sources said what is also likely is that alongside the discussion on budget, the party may plan protests outside.The opposition INDIA bloc is set to coordinate on issues to make the budget discussion look like a focused assault on the govt, with jobs, prices, security, railways, NEET and examinations paper leaks on the forefront. Some of these issues led to disruption in the last session. A coordination meeting of allies is likely ahead of the session or discussion.However, if business days are left after the passage of the budget and the finance bill, the opposition will demand separate discussions on issues of its priority. A similar demand for discussion on NEET in the first session, with Rahul Gandhi writing to PM Narendra Modi to lead the debate, led to adjournment of the Lok Sabha a day in advance.","Congress leader Rahul Gandhi Wednesday said that every section of society is hurting from issues like inflation or unemployment or govt indifference.

It has also demanded 10 constables to assist the probe officers.After hearing CBI's plea, the bench asked the agency's counsel to supply copies of the application to the Haryana govt counsel, who was directed to respond on July 22, the next date of hearing.CBI had taken up the investigation following HC directions in 2019. The fake admissions in state-run schools came up before the HC in May 2016 during the hearing of a case pertaining to surplus teachers in the state.

The three bills, as well as the Punjab Affiliated Colleges (Security of Service) Amendment Bill, 2023, were passed during a special session convened in June last year. The governor withheld his assent on the bills on the ground that the June session of the legislative assembly was illegal. The state went to the SC, which in Nov ruled in favour of govt, holding the session constitutionally valid, and asked the governor to take a decision on the four bills.On Nov 24, following the SC verdict, CM Bhagwant Mann wrote to Purohit requesting him to give his assent to the pending bills ""forthwith"", with the latter promptly replying that these were under his ""active consideration"" and an appropriate decision would be taken ""expeditiously"".Subsequently, he accorded assent to one bill and reserved the other three for consideration of the President.","The Punjab Universities Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2023 proposing to replace the governor with the chief minister as the chancellor of state universities has been returned by President Droupadi Murmu.

10% quota for Agniveers in Haryana jobs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/10-quota-for-agniveers-in-haryana-jobs/articleshow/111818051.cms,"CHANDIGARH: In a bid to secure the future of youth from Haryana recruited as Agniveers for a period of four years, the state govt on Wednesday announced 10% horizontal reservation for these soldiers in direct recruitment for posts of constable, mining guard, forest guard, jail warden, and special police officer (SPO).Haryana govt announced that Agniveers will be given a 5% horizontal reservation in direct recruitment for civil posts in Group-C and 1% horizontal reservation in Group-B.The state has also decided to grant Agniveers a three-year relaxation in the maximum age limit for govt jobs in Group-B and Group-C categories. For the first batch of Agniveers, this age relaxation will be five years.Those Agniveers intending to establish their own business would be given interest benefit on loans up to Rs 5 lakh.While making the announcement, Haryana CM Nayab Singh Saini said any industrial unit providing a monthly salary of more than Rs 30,000 to an Agniveer would get an annual subsidy of Rs 60,000 from the state govt.Saini said Agniveers would be given arms licences on priority and those seeking employment in govt departments/boards/corporations would be given priority in the matrix score.Political observers said the Agniveer scheme was an important issue in the Lok Sabha polls with the opposition promising to scrap the scheme, if voted to power. Observers pointed out that the scheme had led to resentment among youth as they were selected for a period of four years. The Haryana govt's decision is significant, as the Army has been the biggest employer for youth from the state, they added.Given the job insecurity and absence of status of being an ex-serviceman on completion of the engagement period as Agniveer, youth from the state had started joining even Group-D posts instead of choosing to join the Army under the Agniveer scheme.There has been a demand in Haryana to scrap the scheme and to restore old system of recruiting soldiers who could work for 15 years and be released from the forces with pension and other benefits.","Haryana govt announced 10% horizontal reservation for these soldiers in direct recruitment for posts of constable, mining guard, forest guard, jail warden, and special police officer (SPO) Agniveers will be given a five-year relaxation in the maximum age limit for govt jobs in Group-B and Group-C categories.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111818069,imgsize-47598,width-400,resizemode-4/111818069.jpg"

Pack of stray dogs maul 18-month-old to death in Hyderabad,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/pack-of-stray-dogs-maul-infant-to-death-in-hyderabad/articleshow/111822453.cms,"No action on issue despite no. of plaints, say residents

HYDERABAD: A nightmare returned to haunt Hyderabad on Tuesday evening when an 18-month-old boy was attacked and brutally killed by a pack of stray dogs at Adarsh Nagar under Jawahar Nagar Municipal Corporation in the city's eastern suburbs.In the past 12 months, at least eight children have been killed by stray dogs in the state. Six of these attacks have taken place in just the past three months, creating an uproar among residents.Even chief minister Revanth Reddy issued a statement asking authorities to check the stray dog menace . The Telangana high court too has taken up the issue and asked Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) to come up with solutions.In the latest attack, the toddler P Vihaan was playing outside his relatives' house between 7 pm and 7.30 pm when a pack of around 15 dogs pounced on him, dragged him for several metres and inflicted severe injuries on his face and body. The savage mauling left the boy almost unrecognisable.Vihaan's parents, who are originally from Siddipet, had come to the city only two weeks ago and were living with a relative in the hope of finding work. On Tuesday, they had gone to a nearby pharmacy to buy medicines for their unwell daughter and asked Vihaan's grandmother to keep an eye on him until they returned. However, the grandmother did not notice the toddler wandering out of the house, which is when the dogs attacked him.""The family desperately sought medical treatment for the toddler at two private hospitals. However, both denied admission,"" M Pavan Kumar, Vihaan's uncle told TOI.As a last resort, we rushed him to Gandhi Hospital, hoping for a miracle. Unfortunately, the doctors said the boy’s condition had deteriorated rapidly and his heartbeat eventually stopped,” Pavan Kumar added.Locals told TOI that 30 stray dogs roam the Adarsh Nagar streets. They survive on leftover food discarded by residents and scraps from a garbage dump. There are also many butcher shops on the roadside which dump their waste in the open, attracting the strays.“The municipal officials have been largely unresponsive to the grievances raised on stray dogs,” said P Venkatesh, a local resident of Adarsh Nagar.Taj Mohan Reddy, commissioner, Jawahar Nagar corporation, said they were unable to take effective action due to a lack of stray dog catching vehicles.“We had reached out to GHMC officials requesting assistance. In response, they provided two dog-catching vehicles.We caught as many as 60 dogs in and around Adarsh Nagar and sent these for vaccination. Within a week, all the stray dogs in the municipal limit would be caught, vaccinated, and sterilised,” he added.Jawahar Nagar police station officials said they have registered a complaint by the child’s father under section 194 of the BNSS where the police must be informed in the case of suspicious or unnatural deaths.","18-month-old P Vihaan was attacked and brutally killed by a pack of stray dogs.
