She was found staying under a fake identity in a homestay

(Inputs by Asseem Shaikh)

PUNE: Manorama Khedkar , mother of probationary IAS Puja Khedkar , was arrested on Thursday from a homestay in Raigad district.“She had hired a private cab to visit different places before moving into the home stay facility around 11 pm on Wednesday. She was staying there under a fictitious identity ‘Indubai Dhakane’. The cab driver, Dadasaheb Dhakane, showed his genuine Aadhaar card to the facility owner while Manorama showed the Aadhaar card of the cab driver’s mother to get the room booked,” said Pune Rural SP Pankaj Deshmukh.“Our team, which was tracking her movements, was alerted by a cellphone number which got activated while it was put on surveillance.The location of this cell phone was Hirkaniwadi and our team immediately reached there,” the SP said.Paud police in rural Pune on July 12 had registered the case after a video recently went viral on social media showing Manorama, accompanied by bouncers, brandishing a .25 Webley & Scott pistol on June 5, 2023, during an argument with some farmers over a land ownership issue at Dhadhawali village in Mulshi taluka. One of the farmers lodged a complaint.Manorama was produced before judicial magistrate first class Sudhir G Barde in Paud on Thursday afternoon and was remanded in police custody till July 20 after assistant public prosecutor Amar Nanaware told the court that the police have invoked an attempted murder charge against Manorama on the basis of a supplementary statement recorded by complainant Pandharinath Pasalkar.Pasalkar alleged in the complaint that Manorama reached the parcel of land in a four-wheeler and picked up an argument with him.“She abused and threatened me and other villagers when I told her to leave the place as the land dispute would be decided by the civil court where the matter is pending. However, she insisted that she had purchased the land and her name was in the 7/12 extract showing ownership,” the complainant stated.In the supplementary statement, Pasalkar alleged that Manorama put a pistol to his head and was about to pull the trigger when he sat down in a panic reaction and people accompanying her pulled her back.Nanaware submitted that Pasalkar had then filed a complaint application against Manorama and others with the Paud police but did not pursue the matter out of fear. Pasalkar approached the police after the video relating to the incident went viral on social media recently.Nanaware also submitted in court that the police needed Manorama’s custodial remand to recover her licensed pistol and establish the places she visited while on the run.Nanware also said that the police needed to arrest the other accused named in the FIR and seek details of the land dispute that led to the incident.Manohar Aukirkar, the owner of ‘Parvati Nivas,’ said, “Around 11pm on Wednesday, aman, who drove to our establishment in a car, approached me and said that he and his mother needed a room for an overnight stay. It was raining heavily then and since a woman was accompanying him, we took a humanitarian approach and gave them a room on the second floor of the facility.”Aukirkar said, “We checked the man’s Aadhaar card which carried the name Dadasaheb Dhakane and his photo. The man told us that his mother’s name was Indubai Dhakane. After recording their details, we gave him the room keys.”The video of Manorama brandishing the firearm surfaced after her daughter, probationary IAS officer Puja Khedkar, was shunted to Washim from Pune for demanding facilities she was not entitled to get.Soon one thing after the other started tumbling out about the family, and questions were also raised about Puja’s OBC and disability certificates, which she had used to get IAS cadre despite asub-800 UPSC score.","Manorama Khedkar, mother of probationary IAS Puja Khed Kar, was arrested on Thursday from a homestay in Raigad district.
