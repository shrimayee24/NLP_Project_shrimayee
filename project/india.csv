"Lawyer, 27, faked disappearance to escape marriage, traced to Nepal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lawyer-27-faked-disappearance-to-escape-marriage-traced-to-nepal/articleshow/123421063.cms,"Photo/IANS

BHOPAL: A 27-year-old MP lawyer and civil judge aspirant's desperation to escape family pressure to get married led her to meticulously plan a cross-border escape from Itarsi to Nepal's Kathmandu, dodging CCTVs, toll booths and police checkpoints to ensure she didn't leave any trail leading to the life of obscurity she desired.The 13-day search for Archana Tiwari - involving multiple teams from police, GRP and NDRF - culminated Wednesday in Nepal authorities confirming that an Indian woman found living incognito in Kathmandu matched the profile of the young lawyer reported missing by her family after boarding the Indore-Katni Narmada Express on Aug 7.Investigators said her circuitous escape route took her from Itarsi, where she got off the train with an acquaintance, to Kathmandu via Shujalpur, Indore, Hyderabad, Jodhpur, Delhi and then the UP-Nepal border.Her discarded bag had been found in the B3 coach of the train, leading her brother to file a complaint with GRP Katni on Aug 8, the day after Rakshabandhan.Police said they scanned footage from over 500 CCTV cameras, deployed NDRF personnel to scour a forested patch from Barkheda to Budni, and sent divers to search a 32-km stretch of the Narmada. The breakthrough came when investigators pored through her call records.""The name Saransh Jokchand popped up during the scan. Then one thing led to another,"" an officer said. Investigators found out that Saransh travelled with Archana by the Narmada Express and carried clothes for her to change into before getting into a pre-arranged taxi.Tejinder Singh helped the lawyer avoid being captured on surveillance cameras as he was familiar with areas of the railway station outside CCTV coverage. Archana had stopped using her mobile phones before her disappearing act, police said. She handed one of her phones to Tejinder, instructing him to activate it near Midghat and then discard it.Saransh's interrogation gave police enough clues to reconstruct her escape route. ""Being a lawyer, she knew that a missing person case lodged with GRP usually doesn't get pursued aggressively. She was probably convinced the trail would go cold, little knowing that the case would get the media attention it did,"" SP (railways) Rahul Lodha said.Police found out Archana had turned down at least five marriage proposals in recent months. Her family's decision to get her married to a revenue official was purportedly the last straw.","Archana Tiwari, 27, was reported missing by her family after boarding the Indore-Katni Narmada Express on Aug 7.

RCB Victory Parade Turns Into Nightmare; Fan Frenzy Outside Chinnaswamy Stadium Kills 7+ | Bengaluru

BENGALURU: Karnataka's government introduced a bill in the assembly on Wednesday that is intended to regulate public gatherings and punish violations.The move comes in wake of the stampede outside the Chinnaswamy Stadium on June 4, during RCB's IPL victory celebrations, that resulted in 11 deaths.The Karnataka Crowd Control (Managing Crowd at Events and Places of Gathering) Bill, 2025 seeks to make organisers accountable for safety at public events, mandating prior permissions, safety clearances and indemnity bonds. The proposed legislation mandates that organisers deposit an indemnity bond of Rs 1 crore, which can be invoked in case of damage to public property or loss of life, and proposes jail terms of up to seven years for such violations.The assembly is expected to debate the bill on Thursday. State home minister G Parameshwara, who tabled the bill, said: ""We are bringing in this bill to ensure all safety norms at public events. Apart from punishing the organisers for violations, the legislation seeks to penalise the govt officials and police officers concerned.""Organising unpermitted events may attract imprisonment from three to seven years or fines up to Rs 1 lakh.If fatalities occur due to crowd disasters, the punishment could extend to life imprisonment.Negligence or recklessness leading to injuries can attract jail terms of three to seven years, while loss of life can result in jail sentences ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment.Civil disturbances, such as spreading rumours, creating panic, or instigating violence, will be punishable with up to three years in jail or a fine of Rs 50,000, or both. Disobeying police directions during gatherings will also draw penalties.","Karnataka's government introduced a bill in the assembly that is intended to regulate public gatherings and punish violations.

NEW DELHI: Even as it anchored the protest against the bill on unseating jailed ministers and CMs in the constitutional provisions, Congress claimed BJP brass was conjuring up the provision to keep a check on its two allies - CMs Chandrababu Naidu and Nitish Kumar - a political spin that struck a chord with the rest of the opposition as the issue flared up Wednesday.Rahul Gandhi said the bill takes the country back to ""medieval times"" when a king could just remove anybody at will, just for not liking somebody's face.In the thick of opposition protest on ""vote chori"", Modi govt's move on a constitutional amendment to provide for automatic dismissal of any minister who has been jailed for 30 days, initially surprised anti-BJP camp. But INDIA bloc soon concluded it was a BJP bid to ""distract"" people from ""vote chori"" that has triggered a national campaign under a united rival camp.Congress MP K C Venugopal said, ""When allies like Naidu and Nitish need to be threatened... the home minister brings this dangerous bill that strikes at the heart of the constitutional principles.""The spin is not only in step with opposition's jibes post-2024 that Modi 3.0 is governing on crutches, but adds an intrigue to it.

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Wednesday asserted that, unlike the Congress party 's approach of placing the Prime Minister above the law, the BJP 's policy ensures that the Prime Minister, ministers, and chief ministers are subject to the rule of law.""Now, the people of the country will have to decide whether it is appropriate for a minister, chief minister, or the PM to run the govt while in jail,"" Shah posted on X.He highlighted that Narendra Modi introduced a Constitutional Amendment Bill to bring himself under the law's ambit, while the Congress-led opposition opposed it to ""remain outside the law's ambit, run govts from jail, and not relinquish their attachment to power"".""The purpose of this bill is to elevate the declining level of morality in public life and bring integrity to politics,"" Shah said. The proposed law stipulates that no person in jail can serve as PM, CM, or minister. He noted, ""When the Constitution was framed, our Constitution-makers could not have imagined that in the future, there would be political figures who would not resign on moral grounds before being arrested.Shah pointed out that, in recent years, some CMs and ministers have immorally continued governing from jail without resigning. The bills include a provision allowing an accused politician to seek bail within 30 days of arrest. Shah contrasted this with historical actions, recalling that former PM Indira Gandhi, through Constitutional Amendment No. 39, granted the Prime Minister immunity from legal action.""On the one side, this is the work culture and policy of Congress, that they place the Prime Minister above the law through constitutional amendments. On the other side, the policy of BJP is that we are bringing our govt's PM, ministers, and CMs within the ambit of law,"" he said.Shah noted that BJP and NDA upheld ethical values, citing veteran LK Advani's resignation following allegations. In contrast, he accused Congress of perpetuating an ""unethical tradition"" started by Indira Gandhi. He referred to Congress's attempt to protect RJD leader Lalu Prasad Yadav with an ordinance, which Rahul Gandhi opposed, yet later embraced Yadav publicly in Patna. Shah claimed this exposed the opposition's duplicity.He clarified that the bills were always intended for thorough discussion in the Joint Committee of Parliament. ""Yet, abandoning all shame and decency, entire INDI alliance, led by Congress, gathered to oppose it with crude behaviour to protect the corrupt. Today, the opposition has been completely exposed in front of the public,"" Shah said.","Amit Shah: People of the country will have to decide whether it is appropriate for a minister, chief minister, or the PM to run the govt while in jail.

NEW DELHI: Urging fellow MPs to remember the reason behind the premature vice-presidential election, Congress MP Rahul Gandhi Wednesday asked, ""where has the old VP gone"", echoing queries about Jagdeep Dhankhar's whereabouts in the wake of his absence from public view since his shock resignation exactly a month ago. He even joked that search for Dhankhar has become like ""those Agatha Christie books"".At a gathering of opposition MPs to felicitate their VP candidate B Sudershan Reddy, Rahul said there was a story behind why Dhankhar stepped down and there is a story behind ""why he is in hiding"". He said, ""Why is the (former) VP of India in a situation where he cannot say a word, one word, and has to hide... everybody knows it.... Suddenly, the person who used to burst forth in Rajya Sabha has gone silent, completely silent. So, these are the times we are living in"".Kharge framed the contest between Reddy and BJP nominee CP Radhakrishnan as ""Constitution vs RSS"". He said, ""It is an ideological battle for the soul of our nation. While the ruling party has chosen the ideology of RSS, we uphold the Constitution as our guiding light.""In an allusion to complaints the opposition had with Dhankhar as the Rajya Sabha chairman, Kharge said Reddy's nomination is a promise of restoring fairness to the functioning of the Upper House.Underlining that he keeps abreast of the parliamentary proceedings, VP nominee Reddy said, “I just remembered one quote of Lohia, ‘Jab Sadak Khamosh Hain, Sadan Aawara Banti Hain’. (When streets are silent, the parliament becomes wayward)”. He added that Rahul does not allow the streets to stay silent.In an allusion to complaints the opposition had with Dhankhar as the RS chairman, Kharge said Reddy’s nomination is a promise of restoring fairness to the functioning of the upper house and ending the transgressions against the Constitution. He said the Parliament is witnessing a growing trend of stifling opposition voices and advancing the BJP’s ideology.Claiming that there is a war between those who are attacking the Constitution and those who are defending it, Rahul said, “I happened to look inside his (Reddy’s) pocket, and to my surprise, he had a copy of the Constitution of India. He carries it everywhere. He mentioned that he has been carrying the copy for 52 years.”In the thick of the row triggered by Modi govt’s bill on unseating ministers and chief ministers jailed for 30 days, Kharge said it will be used to destabilise the state govts, especially after a “blatant misuse of parliamentary majority over 11 years to arm the autonomous agencies with draconian powers to target opposition leaders”.Congress leader KC Venugopal said the opposition will hold a mock poll on September 8 to familiarise the MPs with the voting in the VP election.","Congress MP Rahul Gandhi asked, ""where has the old VP gone"" He was speaking at a gathering of opposition MPs to felicitate VP candidate B Sudershan Reddy.

It was contended that several mandals in the districts have only about 20% tribal population, making complete reservation unjustified.The petitioner also expressed apprehension that elections might be conducted without proper reorganisation of scheduled areas, citing a 2015 communication from the Tribal Welfare Commissioner to district collectors recommending rationalisation of scheduled areas to align them with tribal sub-plan areas.Opposing the plea, the state relied on a July 2023 judgment of a coordinate bench of the Telangana High Court upholding similar reservations. “Long-standing regulations in force for over 50 years carry the force of law under Article 13 of the Constitution and remain valid until amended by the competent legislature for the benefit of tribal communities,” the state submitted.Agreeing with the state’s submissions, the High Court observed that since no notification for gram panchayat elections was issued, the petition was premature and not fit for consideration.
