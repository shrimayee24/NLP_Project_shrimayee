The second file he signed resolved that the new government will conduct a skill census in the state to ensure employment opportunities for the youth.

The third file signed by him was for revocation of the Land Titling Act as promised by his Telugu Desam Party ( TDP ) and its allies.

The fourth file signed by the chief minister was to enhance social security pension for elderly people, widows and other beneficiaries to Rs 4,000 from the present Rs 3,000.

The fifth file was to re-open the Anna Canteens, set up by the earlier TDP government to provide meals at Rs 5 to the poor and the middle class. After coming to power in 2019, the YSR Congress government had shut down all 204 Anna Canteens across the state in August 2019 alleging corruption in the scheme.

NEW DELHI: N Chandrababu Naidu , who took oath as Andhra Pradesh chief minister yesterday, started his new innings on Thursday as he moved fast to fulfil some of the key promises his Telugu Desam Party had made during the campaign trail. The chief minister put his signature on five files as soon as he assumed office.Earlier, Chandrababu Naidu visited two temples, Tirupati and Vijayawada Durga, to offer prayers before he reached the secretariat and took charge amid vedic chants.This is the fourth time that Naidu took charge as Andhra chief minister and the second time after the bi-furcation in 2014. Naidu became the chief minister first in 1995, before the Andhra bifurcation and he led the state until 2004 for nine consecutive years. The TDP supremo returned as the chief minister of the bifurcated Andhra in 2014 and served until 2019.He was sworn in as the 18th CM of Andhra Pradesh on Wednesday in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other leaders of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) at a grand event in Vijayawada.

slams BJP-Ajit Pawar tie-up

NCP's claims ignored

The corruption tag

Waiting for Rajya Sabha boost

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra is one of the key states which helped the opposition puncture Prime Minister Modi's claims of ""abki baar, 400 paar"" in the just-concluded Lok Sabha elections. The BJP ended up with just 9 seats, which is less than half of 23, the number of seats it had won in the state 5 years ago. Unfortunately BJP's ""engineered"" allies also failed to contribute to the NDA target.While the split Sena, now the actual Shiv Sena, performed reasonably well, the split NCP, now the official NCP - stares at a tense future. According to news agency IANS, BJP is conducting an internal survey to assess the possibilities of contesting the upcoming assembly elections aloneNCP chief and Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, who had rebelled against his uncle Sharad Pawar and walked out of the party with most of the MLAs and MPs, finds himself in the wilderness after a disastrous showing in Lok Sabha polls. Ajit Pawar 's NCP contested 4 Lok Sabha seats and managed to win only one. Contrast this to the performance of Eknath Shinde , who had rebelled against Uddhav Thackeray, split the Shiv Sena, joined hands with the BJP and went on to become the chief minister of Maharashtra. Shinde's Sena contested 15 seats and won 7 with a strike rate better than the BJP.What's worse - the RSS has come out in the open questioning BJP's wisdom in joining hands with Ajit Pawar. An article in ""Organiser"" magazine, which is linked to the RSS, slammed BJP's move and called it ""unnecessary politicking."" It said the induction of Ajit Pawar's NCP into NDA had reduced the brand value of BJP.""Maharashtra is a prime example of unnecessary politicking and avoidable manipulations. NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar joined BJP though BJP and split SS (Shiv Sena) had a comfortable majority. Sharad Pawar would have faded away in two-three years as NCP would have lost energy with infighting between cousins,"" RSS lifelong member Ratan Sharda said in the article.""Why was this ill-advised step taken? BJP supporters were hurt because they had fought against this Congress ideology for years and were persecuted. In a single stroke, BJP reduced its brand value. After years of struggle to become numero uno in Maharashtra, it became just another political party without any difference,"" he added.The NCP leaders have tried to play down the criticism calling it the personal opinion of the RSS leader. They claim that their alliance with BJP would continue. But the party's reduced bargaining power post elections was evident when PM Modi formed his council of ministers.The NCP is one of the allies who does not have a minister in Modi 3.0. When the contours of the NDA government was being discussed, NCP was the first party to go public with its disappointment over portfolio allocation. Ajit Pawar's party refused to accept minister of state with independent charge post that was being offered for its leader Parful Patel. Pawar said it was a conscious decision taken unanimously as Praful Patel had been a Cabinet minister at the Centre earlier and the offered post would be demotion for him.""I was earlier a Cabinet minister in the Union government, so this will be a demotion for me. We have informed the BJP leadership and they have already told us to just wait a few days, they will take remedial measures,"" Patel had then told reporters.BJP's decision to take Ajit Pawar on board also gave the opposition an opportunity to mock PM Modi over his much-talked about crusade against corruption. This was because the Prime Minister and top BJP leaders had in their earlier rallies accused Ajit Pawar of corruption in the state's irrigation scam.Marginalised after Lok Sabha polls, Ajit Pawar now appears to be waiting for the Rajya Sabha boost to make bigger claims within the NDA. With bulk of NCP MLAs with him, Ajit Pawar will see an increase in the party's tally of MPs in the Upper House. He has already fielded his wife Sunetra Pawar, who had lost Lok Sabha elections to Sharad Pawar's daughter Supriya Sule in Baramati, as NCP candidate for Rajya Sabha elections.Clearly, as BJP now gears up for the assembly elections in the state due later this year, Ajit Pawar may face testing times ahead. Shinde has proved that he will be more valuable as a partner to the saffron party than Ajit Pawar.(With inputs from agencies)",NCP chief and Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar finds himself in the wilderness after a disastrous showing in Lok Sabha polls. BJP is conducting an internal survey to assess the possibilities of contesting the upcoming assembly elections alone.

“Did the victims not deserve a word of sympathy from the self-proclaimed ‘divine’ PM? Modi is busy posting responses to congratulatory tweets by Pakistani leaders — Nawaz Sharif and Pak PM Shahbaz Sharif. Why has he maintained a stoic silence?”

(This is a developing story)

NEW DELHI: A Bengaluru court on Thursday issued a non-bailable arrest warrant against former Karnataka chief minister B S Yediyurappa in a Pocso case .Shortly after the development, the office of the senior BJP leader said the ex-CM has applied for anticipatory bail at a special court seeking prevention from arrest in the case. The court is set to hear the plea on Friday.Reacting to the arrest warrant, the former CM refuted all allegations against him and said there was a political vendetta against him.Yediyurappa has been booked under the Pocso Act and Section 354 A (Sexual harassment) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) based on a complaint by the mother of a 17-year-old girl who alleged that he sexually assaulted her daughter during a meeting in February this year, at his residence in Karnataka.The 54-year-old woman, who had leveled the charge against Yediyurappa, died at a private hospital last month, due to lung cancer.The 81-year-old Yediyurappa has denied the charge and said he would fight the case legally.Earlier in the day, Karnataka home minister G Parameshwara said the Criminal Investigation Department ( CID ), which is probing the case, has issued a notice asking him to appear before it for questioning, and he may be arrested if necessary.""Notice has been served procedurally, the charge-sheet has to be filed by June 15.

TN Lok Sabha Seats: 40-40: Tamil Nadu voters give it all to DMK alliance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/40-40-tamil-nadu-voters-give-it-all-to-dmk-alliance/articleshow/110720261.cms,"CHENNAI: Forty out of forty. That's what Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin told his party cadres last month, urging them to ensure that DMK and its allies win all the 39 Lok Sabha seats in the state and the one in neighbouring Puducherry. And INDIA bloc ticked all the 40 boxes on Tuesday.The big win in the three-cornered fight gives credence to the alliance's ideological bonding strengthened by the common opposition to BJP. It also leaves AIADMK and BJP , former electoral partners, in doldrums to rethink their strategies before the 2026 assembly election.While AIADMK's unimpressive line-up failed to impress the electorate, BJP couldn't do any better with its high-profile candidates like state president K Annamalai (Coimbatore), Union minister L Murugan (Niligirs) and former Telangana governor Tamilisai Soundararajan (Chennai South). Ousted AIADMK leader O Panneerselvam, who contested in Ramanathapuram as an NDA-backed independent, lagged behind DMK ally IUML's K Navaskani by a margin of more than 1.6 lakh (yet to be announced).The counting gave some anxious moments to many candidates. After leading initially, BJP's Tirunelveli candidate and MLA Nainar Nagendran fell by the wayside and Congress candidate Robert Bruce won by more than 1.6 lakh votes. AIADMK ally and DMDK Virudhunagar candidate Vijay Prabhakar, maintained a lead over his Congress rival Manicka Tagore, who finally registered a thin margin of more than 4,000 votes. PMK's Dharmapuri candidate and Sowmiya Anbumani (NDA) gave a tough fight to DMK's A Mani before losing by a margin of 21,000 votes. At the end of counting, DMK's Ganapathy Rajkumar was ahead of Annamalai by more than one lakh votes.Clearly, a divided opposition and a vitriolic anti-NDA campaign that centred on allegations of divisive-communal politics by BJP and Centre starving state of funds helped INDIA bloc's success in TN. Stalin's strategy to showcase his priorities of politics and governance helped win over the Tamil audience. In Puducherry, too, Congress candidate and sitting MP V Vaithilingam won, beating his BJP rival A Namassivayam by a margin of around one lakh votes.As soon as the trends showed INDIA bloc leading in most of the constituencies, Stalin visited his father M Karunanidhi's memorial on Marina beach in Chennai and paid his respects. Later in the evening, Stalin said, ""I know my height,"" repeating his father's famous words when asked about his aspirations and probability of his playing a role at the national level.Stalin will leave for Delhi on Wednesday morning to take part in the INDIA bloc meeting. He thanked his alliance leaders and cadres for their efforts ""to defeat fascism and to safeguard democracy and the Constitution"".In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the DMK-led alliance bucked the national trend to win 38 seats in TN, leaving only the Theni seat to the then united AIADMK in the company of BJP, and grabbing the lone Puducherry seat as well. With the 2024 Lok Sabha poll victory in TN, Stalin has pulled off a hattrick with his successes in 2019 and 2021 (assembly election) after taking over the DMK reins. Party colleagues and allies say the victory is a referendum for Stalin's governance.In the opposition camp, while AIADMK rejoiced its second position with an overall vote share of 20%, having contested 32 seats, the BJP was muted in its celebration, having lost all the 19 seats it contested.The opposition contest and campaign centered on ""exposing"" DMK and Stalin with attacks on their failure to keep the pre-poll promises and practicing corruption and dynasty politics. The 'DMK files' (audio recordings of alleged conversations of some DMK functionaries), allegations of misgovernance, poor law and order, arrest and IT searches of senior ministers and charges of nepotism following the elevation of Stalin's son Udhayanidhi failed to cut ice with the electorate.",INDIA bloc ticked all the 40 boxes on Tuesday.
