'If You Ask PM To Dance...': Rahul Gandhi Targets Modi, Says BJP Remote Controls Nitish Kumar

'Nitish ji's face being used': Rahul

NEW DELHI: Weeks after the Election Commission announced poll dates in Bihar -- and days after the Mahagathbandhan released its chief ministerial face -- leader of opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi finally kicked off his election campaign in the state on Wednesday. Addressing a rally in Muzaffarpur, the Congress leader launched a fierce attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi , claiming that ""he just wants vote"" and alleging that he would go to any extent to win elections.“He just wants your vote. If 200 people from the crowd ask PM Modi to dance on stage in return for votes, the dance would begin. PM Modi will start performing Bharatnatyam on stage,” Rahul said.Taking a swipe at the Prime Minister’s statement on Chhath Puja observance on the banks of the Yamuna, Rahul mocked the act, saying, “They staged a drama and showed the truth of India... The Yamuna has dirty water. If someone drank it, they would either get sick or die. No one can go inside. The water is so dirty that if you enter it, you would get sick or get an infection... But Modi staged a drama. He built a small pond there. .. They will show you anything for elections... A pipe is installed from behind. Clean water is poured into it... The problem arose that someone took a photo of the pipe..”Continuing his tirade, Rahul reiterated his charge of “vote chori” and accused the BJP of subverting democracy. “They are engaged in stealing your votes.Because they want to end this election disease. I am telling you, they stole elections in Maharashtra, they stole elections in Haryana, and they will try their best in Bihar,” he said.The Congress leader also hit out at PM Modi over economic policies, accusing him of crushing small businesses through demonetisation and GST. “Tell me what is written on the back of your phone. Made in China. Narendra Modi ji has destroyed all the small businesses by implementing demonetisation and GST. Wherever you look, it is Made in China. We say that it should not be Made in China, it should be Made in Bihar. Mobiles, shirts, pants — all these should be made in Bihar and the youth of Bihar should get employment in those factories. We want such a Bihar,” he declared.BJP spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari on Wednesday hit back at Congress MP Rahul Gandhi over his remark that “PM Modi will dance for votes,” branding him a “local goon.”Bhandari accused the Congress leader of “mocking voters” and “insulting” the poor with his comments.In a post on X, the BJP leader said, “Rahul Gandhi speaks like a ‘Local Goon’. Rahul Gandhi has openly insulted every poor of India, & Bihar who has voted for PM Narendra Modi ji! Rahul Gandhi has mocked voters and Indian democracy.”Rahul didn’t spare Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar either, claiming he was merely a “face” while the BJP pulled the strings from behind. “Nitish ji’s face is being used. The remote control is in the hands of the BJP. You should not think that the voice of the most backward people is heard there,” he said.Accusing the BJP of being “against social justice,” Rahul added, “Three or four people control it. BJP controls it. They have the remote controller in their hands, and they have nothing to do with social justice. I said in front of the Prime Minister in the Lok Sabha that you should get the caste census done. He did not say a single word... BJP is against social justice. They do not want it.”As Bihar gears up for a high-stakes battle, the political lines are clearly drawn. The NDA -- comprising the BJP, JD(U), LJP (Ram Vilas), Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular), and Rashtriya Lok Morcha -- faces off against the Mahagathbandhan, led by the RJD and including Congress, CPI-ML, CPI, CPM, and Mukesh Sahani’s VIP.Adding another twist, Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj has announced candidates for all 243 assembly seats. Bihar will vote in two phases on November 6 and 11, with results to be declared on November 14.","Rahul Gandhi kicks off his election campaign in Bihar on Wednesday.

""The anthem was sung with the reverence reserved for India's own,"" he said Wednesday.The row erupted after Congress functionary Bidhu Bhushan Das sang ""Amar Sonar Bangla, Ami Tomay Bhalobasi"" during a Congress Seva Dal meeting. The song was written by Rabindranath Tagore in 1905 during the Swadeshi movement opposing Bengal's first partition under British rule. It was adopted by Bangladesh as its national anthem in 1971.Sarma linked the episode to what he described as the neighbouring country's growing ""Greater Bangladesh"" narrative and part of a ""Pakistan-backed project"". The CM cited a recent event in Dhaka where Bangladesh's interim chief adviser Mohammed Yunus gifted a book ""Art of Triumph"" to Pakistan's joint chiefs of staff committee chairman Gen Sahir Shamshad Mirza.The cover featured an abstract map that appeared to include the northeast.""Instead of taking action, Gaurav Gogoi seems quietly pleased,"" Sarma said.Congress deputy leader in Lok Sabha Gogoi defended the song's use, saying it predated Bangladesh's independence and represented Bengal's emotional identity.

PATNA/NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Wednesday asserted in Darbhanga that there is no vacancy for the post of prime minister of India or chief minister of Bihar as the present incumbents will continue on the two posts while exuding confidence that NDA is headed for victory with a two-thirds majority in Bihar.Speaking at a News18 event in Patna later, Shah also hit out at Rahul Gandhi, saying the Congress functionary will ""pay the price"" for his recent remarks on PM Narendra Modi, adding that Gandhi insulted Chhathi Maiya and her devotees.

He will suffer adverse consequences of this in Bihar elections,"" he said.Shah also launched a broadside against dynastic politics at the poll rally in Darbhanga. ""Sonia Gandhi wants to make her son Rahul the PM and Lalu Prasad wants to make his son (Tejashwi Yadav) the CM of Bihar. However, I want to tell them that there is no vacancy for either post.

""Popular Front of India (PFI) was formed here, but the then Congress govt had not banned it.

Congress Demands Swift Action After BJP Spokesperson Threatens Rahul Gandhi





NEW DELHI: Police have arrested BJP functionary Mahendra Nagar, accused in the case of farmer Ramswaroop Dhakad’s death in Ganeshpura village, Guna district.Confirming the arrest, SP Ankit Soni said, “The police have now arrested the main accused in this entire murder case, Mahendra Nagar. So far, four people have been arrested in this entire case, who are the main accused in this murder case. The arrest of ten people is still pending. The police had announced a reward of Rs 10,000 on Mahendra Nagar.”According to police, the incident took place on Sunday when Dhakad and his wife were heading to their farm.A group of 10 to 15 armed men allegedly attacked them with iron rods and later ran him over with a vehicle.When his two daughters tried to save him, Nagar allegedly pinned one of them to the ground, sat on her chest and tore her clothes.He has been charged with murder, molestation and criminal conspiracy.Following the incident, Madhya Pradesh BJP chief Hemant Khandelwal expelled Nagar from the party. Police said the attack was linked to a land dispute between the victim and Nagar’s relative, Kanhaiya Nagar, who lives in Pachlavda village in Rajasthan’s Baran district.“The mob fired guns and threatened locals so that the victim could not be taken to a hospital for treatment,” an officer said. Dhakad died within an hour.Nagar, who was the local booth committee chief and a former Kisan Morcha office-bearer, had joined the BJP after Jyotiraditya Scindia and 22 MLAs moved from the Congress to the BJP in March 2020.MP Congress media cell chief Mukesh Nayak said, “Such atrocities by BJP netas and workers on the common man is growing because the party takes no action when such crimes are committed.

Mohammed Azharuddin set to join Telangana cabinet: Congress eyes minority outreach; move ahead of Jubilee Hills bypoll,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/azhar-set-to-join-revanths-cabinet-tomorrow/articleshow/124918304.cms,"



HYDERABAD: Ahead of the crucial Jubilee Hills assembly by-election on November 11, the All India Congress Committee (AICC) has approved former India cricketer and Telangana Congress working president Mohammed Azharuddin's induction into chief minister A Revanth Reddy-led state cabinet. This is being seen as a strategic move given that Muslims comprise nearly 25% of the 3.98 lakh voters in Jubilee Hills.Sources told TOI Azharuddin will be sworn in as a minister at 12.15 pm on Friday. He will be the lone minister from the minority community. There are three vacancies in the cabinet and one of them is being filled up now.However, Azharuddin must become a member of the legislative council (MLC) or MLA within six months from the swearing-in. If not he would lose his ministry. He had contested and lost the assembly election from Jubilee Hills in Dec 2023.The Congress govt has recommended his name for an MLC seat under the governor's quota which is pending with the Raj Bhavan. Sources said governor Jishu Dev Varma has not approved Azharuddin's and Telangana Jana Samiti president Kondandaram's names because of a case pending in the Supreme Court.The top court had in Aug stayed the appointments of Kodandaram and journalist Amer Ali Khan under the governor's quota on a petition filed by BRS leaders Dasoju Sravan and Kurra Satyanarayana.The petition alleged that the appointments violated previous interim orders of the court. The case was posted for next hearing in Nov. Subsequently, the Congress govt had sent Azharuddin's name replacing Khan.Sources told TOI that AICC approved Azharuddin's name after repeated survey reports from Jubilee Hills revealed that the Muslims were unhappy over the Congress govt not having a minister from the community, when all the previous govts, including those in undivided AP, had at least one Muslim minister. Also, there was no one from Greater Hyderabad in the cabinet, a hole that the former India cricket captain will fill.""It also goes well with the secular image of the Congress and party leaders will tell the voters in the Bihar assembly election campaign too that social justice has been done in Telangana,"" a senior AICC leader said.Though there were doubts about whether a cabinet expansion could be taken up when the by-election model code was in force, officials said there were no issues. ""As per the Election Commission rules, expanding a cabinet is a constitutional obligation and does not fall under the purview of ad-hoc appointments or policy decisions intended to influence voters. A cabinet expansion is considered a necessary and legitimate function of the government, not an electoral freebie,"" an official said.Chief minister A Revanth Reddy on Wednesday held a meeting with Muslim religious scholars, state heads of Jamat E Islami, Ahle Hadees, Tableeqi Jamaat and other associations and assured them that the Congress govt would attend to every demand placed by them for the welfare of the community. Subsequently, they extended support to the Congress in Jubilee Hills. Congress leaders Mohammed Ali Shabbir, Mohammed Azharuddin, Faheem Qureshi and minister G Vivek, and AIMIM MLA Kausar Mohiuddin attended the meeting.",Mohammed Azharuddin will be sworn in as a minister at 12.15 pm on Friday.
