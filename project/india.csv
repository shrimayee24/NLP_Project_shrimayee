NEW DELHI: Amid the ongoing logjam in Parliament, PM Narendra Modi will address the BJP-led NDA parliamentary party meeting on Tuesday, a get-together of the alliance's MPs that is being held after a considerable gap, and the first during the current session of Parliament.The NDA meeting also holds significance as filing of nomination papers for the election to the vice-president of India's post begins from Aug 7. The BJP-led bloc will have to announce its candidate - whose election to the post will be a certainty due to the alliance's majority in the electoral college - by Aug 21, the last date of nomination-filing and the monsoon session of Parliament.The electoral college for the vice-president poll includes MPs of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, and its current strength is 782. If the opposition also names a candidate - a distinct possibility - then the poll is scheduled to be held on Sept 9.The meeting comes in the middle of a session which has been a washout so far, except for a two-day discussion on the Pahalgam attack and Operation Sindoor, due to a united opposition's continuous protest against the special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar by Election Commission.PM Modi is expected to speak on a host of issues as the opposition has been raising the heat over the poll body's alleged partisan conduct favouring govt, and the terror attack and Operation Sindoor.Sources said Modi may ask alliance MPs to counter the opposition's narrative and also boost the 'Tiranga Yatra' being organised in view of Independence Day.The parliamentary party is also likely to felicitate the PM for the success of Operation Sindoor and neutralisation of the terrorists involved in the attack.Since the 2024 LS elections, when BJP lost its majority but comfortably crossed the halfway mark with allies, the meeting of the party's MPs every session was expanded to include its allies. Before the last national elections, the PM used to address weekly meetings of the BJP parliamentary party during Parliament sessions.",PM Narendra Modi will address the BJP-led NDA parliamentary party meeting on Tuesday.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday came down heavily on the Punjab Police officers who had allegedly assaulted a serving Army Colonel and his son during an altercation over parking at an eatery when they were travelling from Delhi to Patiala, and reminded them that they were sleeping peacefully because Armymen were protecting the borders in adverse conditions.A bench of Justices Sanjay Kumar and Satish Chandra Sharma dismissed the appeal filed against the Punjab and Haryana HC directing an investigation by CBI in the case. The court said that the HC order was well-reasoned and rejected the plea of the police officers.""When war is going on, you glorify these Army officers... Have respect for Army people. You are sleeping peacefully in your house because that man is serving at the border at -40 degrees (Celsius)... We are going to dismiss this with heavy cost. This kind of lawlessness is not acceptable. Let CBI look into this... They go and defend you, and they come back wrapped in a national flag,"" the bench said.HC had ordered a CBI probe into the alleged assault of Army Colonel Pushpinder Singh Bath by Punjab Police personnel in Patiala. It had allowed the plea of Colonel Bath accusing the SIT of ""shielding"" the accused cops. According to the Colonel, who is currently serving as deputy secretary at the cabinet secretariat, he was a hapless victim of extreme brutality and high handedness of Punjab Police.","HC had ordered a CBI probe into the alleged assault of Army Colonel Pushpinder Singh Bath.
