"BJD, AIADMK, YSRCP flag neglect of Odisha, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjd-aiadmk-ysrcp-flag-neglect-of-odisha-tamil-nadu-and-andhra-pradesh/articleshow/112028857.cms,"NEW DELHI: BJD, AIADMK and YSRCP , the three parties that so far have mostly bailed out the BJP-led govt in Rajya Sabha, flagged inadequate budget for Odisha , Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. The charge from BJD was more intense as it alleged that it was complete “betrayal of Odisha” despite the state having elected 20 BJP MPs in the general elections, which has helped Narendra Modi to become Prime Minister for the third consecutive time.BJD’s Debashish Samantaray alleged the govt has neglected the regional aspiration despite 204 MPs in the Lok Sabha members are from regional parties. Raising the issue of inadequate budgetary allocation to Odisha, the MP said, “I don’t remember how many times they came running to Naveen Patnaik’s knees for their govt’s sake. We supported them, but they forgot. Just to win an election such wrong narratives and such unparliamentary aspersions about Naveen Patnaik’s health. What standards Indian politics has gone to?”The BJP MP alleged the govt for regional imbalance by neglecting West Bengal, Odisha, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh. He charged the govt of appeasing only two states and no mention of Odisha in President’s speech and Budget despite the state taking lead in supplying oxygen during the Covid-19 crisis. The BJD legislator said the state has got nothing despite being the biggest producer of coal and iron ore. “Today in Rajya Sabha, the opposition is more (number) than the ruling party,” Samantaray said.In response to a stray remark, he said, “Let the President’s election come, then you will see.”Participating in the discussion, AIADMK member C Ve Shanmugam said that the allocation of funds in the Budget “does not sufficiently address the pressing needs of Tamil Nadu” in relation to infrastructure, social justice, healthcare and education. He added that govt has made no provision for new projects, no allocation for the industrial corridor and for phase-2 of Chennai Metro.In his speech, even YSRCP leader V Vijayasai Reddy charged the govt of doing figure jugglery to give an impression that majority of the fund has gone to Andhra Pradesh. He said the Budget only talks of arranging Rs 15,000 crore loan for development of the state capital. “Can it be treated as a grant? Even the interest and repayment has to be done by the state,” he said.","BJD, AIADMK and YSRCP flagged inadequate budget for Odisha, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh.

Raut said even I was told to listen to the BJP to avoid getting arrested by ED and get my name out.“Anil Deshmukh used to meet me in jail when we were both in jail and he told me 1.5 years ago that these things took place. There is dirty politics in the state due to Fadnavis. BJP is happy to make other people's clips all its life. BJP has a clips factory. Make clips, tap people's phones. Phones of opposition leaders were tapped. There were women police officers who tapped the phones of the opponents, if Devendra Fadnavis is giving them prestige by making them the director general of police, then what can we expect,” Raut said.“What Anil Deshmukh said is 100% true. If you want to remove your name from ED, then this is BJP's policy. I was told the same. Why did many people including Ashok Chavan, Praful Patel and Hasan Mushrif go there (to MahaYuti)? Why did MLAs and MPs go with (Eknath) Shinde? Why did Nawab Malik go? Because all of them have gone there to escape from ED and under the pressure of the BJP. Anil Deshmukh told me all this while I was in jail. Anil Deshmukh is speaking the truth. Often the truth has no evidence, it cannot be collected, and thus the truth is defeated,” Raut said.Fadnavis has refuted the allegations, saying Deshmukh's own party members had incriminating audio-visual evidence against him. ""If false accusations continue to be levelled against me, I will have no choice but to make this evidence public,"" he said.Deshmukh linked his allegations to the controversy involving former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh, who accused the former minister of a Rs 100-crore extortion scheme.
