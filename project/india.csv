NEW DELHI: Following the Mahayuti alliance’s sweeping victory in the Maharashtra assembly elections, speculation is rife about who will be the state’s next chief minister. Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Chhagan Bhujbal on Sunday hinted at the possibility of Ajit Pawar assuming the top post, emphasising NCP's strong performance.""Ajit Pawar could also be the CM.Our (NCP's) strike rate is very good. A discussion will soon be held in this regard,"" the Yevla constituency winner told reporters, signaling the party’s aspirations in shaping the new government.Pune NCP president Deepak Mankar also voiced support for Pawar, describing him as a capable leader. ""The workers of NCP wish that if 'Dada' (Ajit Pawar) becomes CM, Maharashtra will get a good direction. We know the kind of work he did as Deputy CM in the last 2.5 years... Mahayuti is taking everyone along,"" Mankar told ANI.However, the BJP seems to have its own preference. BJP's winning candidate from Savner Ashishrao Deshmukh highlighted strong support within the BJP for former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis.Deshmukh said, ""The people of Maharashtra have decided to stand with BJP and Mahayuti. We have got unprecedented results in the state. Our aim is to meet the expectations of the people and make Maharashtra the number one state in the next five years. The parliamentary board will decide the CM’s face, but BJP workers and MLAs favor Devendra Fadnavis for the role.""In the Maharashtra assembly elections, Mahayuti achieved a significant victory by winning 230 seats out of the total 288 constituencies.The BJP emerged as the largest party with 132 seats, whilst their coalition partners performed well - chief minister Eknath Shinde's Shiv Sena secured 57 seats, and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar's NCP obtained 41 seats in the state assembly.The opposition alliance faced significant setbacks, with Uddhav Thackeray's Shiv Sena (UBT) securing 20 seats, Congress obtaining 16 seats, and Sharad Pawar's NCP(SP) winning only 10 seats.",Mahayuti alliance's sweeping victory in Maharashtra assembly elections.

"Maharashtra govt formation: Deal was Shiv Sena chief would be CM, says neta close to Eknath Shinde",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maharashtra-govt-formation-deal-was-shiv-sena-chief-would-be-cm-says-neta-close-to-eknath-shinde/articleshow/115674668.cms,"Eknath Shinde

MUMBAI: A Shiv Sena neta close to Eknath Shinde said there was an agreement after the Lok Sabha elections that Shinde would take over the reins of the state if Mahayuti won the assembly polls. The neta said that after the Mahayuti's debacle in the LS polls, there were a series of meetings to draft a strategy for the assembly elections. In these meetings, it was decided that BJP would contest the maximum number of seats followed by Shiv Sena and NCP, but ""irrespective of the number of seats the Mahayuti constituents win, Shinde will continue to be the CM if Mahayuti secures a clear majority,"" the neta said.However, BJP has taken a different view on this claim, saying that when Union home minister Amit Shah was in Mumbai, he had made it clear that Mahayuti was no doubt contesting the assembly polls under the leadership of Shinde, but in the event Mahayuti secured a clear majority, the new CM would be decided by BJP's parliamentary board and heads of Shiv Sena and NCP. ""Shah's statement on the appointment of the new CM is clear. He never said Shinde would be made the CM,"" a BJP neta said.NCP has already appointed Ajit Pawar as group leader of its legislative party and Shiv Sena too has elected Eknath Shinde as leader of the Shiv Sena legislature party. BJP is yet to convene a meeting of its legislature party. A BJP leader said that was owing to a procedural wrangle. According to BJP procedure, the leader of the legislature party is appointed in the presence of a central observer. ""Once the central observer is appointed, we will convene a meeting to elect the leader of the BJP legislature,"" the BJP neta said.A senior NCP neta expressed surprise over the uncertainty over the CM's post. ""After the results were announced, except for a congratulatory message, there is no further word from the BJP leadership. We do not know how to move forward. We were expecting that since Mahayuti has secured an absolute majority, the CM would be quickly elected,"" the neta said.Shiv Sena MP Naresh Mhaske said they believe Eknath Shinde will be declared CM by the NDA brass.","A Shiv Sena neta close to Eknath Shinde said there was an agreement after the Lok Sabha elections.

"'Maha' CM tussle: Shiv Sena pitches for Eknath Shinde with 'Bihar model' example; Will Fadnavis, Ajit Pawar agree?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maha-cm-tussle-shiv-sena-pitches-for-eknath-shinde-with-bihar-model-example-will-fadnavis-ajit-pawar-agree/articleshow/115664635.cms,"'BJP should follow Bihar model in Maharashtra'

Will NCP play the kingmaker?

Will Fadnavis sacrifice, again?

NEW DELHI: Who will be the next chief minister of Maharashtra? It's advantage Devendra Fadnavis amid suspense over which Mahayuti leader gets the top job. The BJP, with 132 seats - only 12 less than the half-way mark in the 288-member assembly, is the strongest contender for the post and needs only one ally to form a government. But, the Shiv Sena, despite winning only 57 seats - which is less than half of BJP's tally, is not giving up easily.The leaders of Shiv Sena, according to reports, feel that it was their leader Eknath Shinde , who as the incumbent chief minister, paved the way for the historic win of the ruling alliance with his governance. They also cite data from opinion poll surveys to claim that Shinde is the most popular leader of the Mahayuti.Shiv Sena spokesperson Naresh Mhaske on Monday pitched for Eknath Shinde as the chief minister citing BJP's arrangement with Nitish Kumar in Bihar. ""We feel Shinde should be the chief minister, just like in Bihar where BJP did not look at the numbers but still made JD(U) leader Nitish Kumar the CM. Senior leaders of the Mahayuti (in Maharashtra) will ultimately take a decision,"" Mhaske said.The Lok Sabha member compared the situation to the leadership dynamics in Haryana, where the BJP contested the assembly elections recently under Nayab Singh Saini's leadership.""The election in Maharashtra was contested under the leadership of Shinde, Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar . This shows that the alliance's leadership should be respected,"" he said and added: ""Shinde has established himself as a commoner. He is the most popular leader in recent surveys by some news channels. His name is the frontrunner.""Shinde, who has emerged as a strong contender for the post, is not missing any opportunity to assert that his government's 'Majhi Ladki Bahin' scheme was the gamechanger in the elections. On Sunday he met with beneficiaries of the scheme and expressed his gratitude to them for the historic win of the Mahayuti alliance.Addressing the gathering, CM Shinde said that the government will soon increase the amount to Rs 2100 as promised.""I am with you all, I thank all Majhi Ladki Bahin for electing me. You all chose Mahayuti, as we promised we will be giving Rs 2100 to all my sisters. This government is yours and you choose this government again. I feel blessed you all came here and gave me blessings. This is a common people's government and we are working for the growth of Maharashtra,"" he said.However, going by the numbers there's no way Shiv Sena can dictate terms with the BJP.The NCP, which had hoped to be the kingmaker in government formation, may end up playing a key role in deciding between Fadnavis and Shinde as the next chief minister of the state. Ajit Pawar's party proved several experts wrong as it won an impressive 41 seats and established its rightful place in the alliance. Ajit Pawar, who was blamed for the drubbing of Mahayuti in Lok Sabha elections earlier this year, is now in a position to play the kingmaker.Ajit Pawar on Monday said no ""formula"" was being discussed for the chief minister's post and a decision on it will be taken together by the Mahayuti partners. ""Yesterday, NCP selected me as the party's leader in the assembly. Eknath Shinde was also elected as Shiv Sena's leader in the assembly and BJP will also do the same. We will sit together and discuss and will provide a stable government,"" he said.Ajit Pawar also said they will decide what formula to work out on the cabinet formation among the three parties. ""There are news reports that government should be formed before November 27 or else there will be President's rule, but there's nothing like that,"" the NCP leader said.The NCP supremo may prefer Fadnavis over Shinde as his boss given the fact that as a regional leader Shinde and Shiv Sena would be a bigger future rival.Fadnavis, who served as chief minister of Maharashtra from 2014 to 2019, has led the BJP to its best-ever performance in the state. In 2019, he could not become the chief minister as pre-poll ally Uddhav Thackeray parted ways from the NDA and formed the MVA government with Congress and NCP. In 2022, Fadnavis worked closely with Eknath Shinde to oust the MVA government and pave the way for the return of NDA government. However, the top BJP leadership then decided to give the top job to Eknath Shinde. Fadnavis, who had then announced to stay out of the government, was asked by the party leadership to work as Shinde's deputy.With Shinde's Shiv Sena making strong claims for the top job, it will be interesting to see if Fadnavis, after helping the party win record 132 seats, is ready for another sacrifice in the name of alliance.While Shinde remained the chief minister of the Mahayuti during the elections, Fadnavis, as deputy CM, played an important role in the governance. In the run up to the polls, when asked by reporters who is the CM face of the Mahayuti vis-à-vis the MVA, Fadnavis evaded a direct reply and said ""Our chief minister is sitting here, who is the CM face of the MVA?"" He did not say that Shinde was the CM face of the alliance.","The BJP, with 132 seats, is the strongest contender for the post and needs only one ally to form a government. Shiv Sena, despite winning only 57 seats - which is less than half of BJP's tally, is not giving up easily.

EW DELHI: Delhi Police on Monday arrested Lokesh Sharma , then OSD of former Rajasthan CM and Congress veteran Ashok Gehlot , in the phone-tapping case. Although Sharma secured bail, police are likely to seek his remand for custodial interrogation, sources said. Police didn't confirm reports of Sharma turning approver.The allegations date back to July 2020 when Gehlot faced a rebellion from deputy CM Sachin Pilot and the latter's loyalists.An FIR was registered on March 25, 2021, on complaint by Gajendra Singh Shekhawat , Union minister and Jodhpur BJP MP.The FIR accused Sharma of circulating audio clips of alleged telephonic conversations between Shekhawat and Congress functionaries, apparently discussing toppling the Gehlot govt.Sharma arrest is expected to open a can of worms. He was questioned multiple times over the last four years, with the last interrogation in Sept this year. He is learnt to have said Gehlot handed him a pen drive containing audio recordings. Sharma had alleged that Gehlot instructed him to release the recordings to the media, while insisting that only the former CM could provide further details. Sharma submitted the pen drive and other evidence to Delhi Police.Delhi HC had lifted the stay on his arrest on Nov 15 after Sharma withdrew his plea for such protection. Sharma had told the HC that he had cooperated with the investigation from the beginning and would continue to do so.Sharma alleged that Gehlot placed several netas, including Pilot and his allies, under surveillance and their movements were monitored. He submitted a seven-page statement describing the sequence of events on July 16, 2020. He claimed to have transferred the recordings to a laptop and then to his phone before uploading them on social media.","Lokesh Sharma, then OSD of former Rajasthan CM and Congress veteran Ashok Gehlot, arrested in phone-tapping case.

Devendra Fadnavis: Will he be back in 2024 after being so-near-yet-so-far in 2019?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/devendra-fadnavis-will-he-be-back-in-2024-after-being-so-near-yet-so-far-in-2019/articleshow/115617326.cms,"Despite leading the BJP to a historic victory in the Maharashtra assembly elections and a previous promise to return as Chief Minister, Devendra Fadnavis's future role hangs in the balance.

In 2019, he famously said: “Me Punha Yein” (I’ll be back). In 2024, he’s maintaining a diplomatic silence even as everyone’s wondering: “Toh Punha Yeil ka?” (Will he be back?).Simple math should yield a resounding yes. BJP’s numbers are more than double of Shiv Sena’s. Logically it’s a no contest. But politics is not about hard numbers alone and with Shinde camp dropping enough hints that status quo should prevail it’s to be seen whether the man from Nagpur will head to Mantralaya as CM or not.Fadnavis played a stellar role in leading the tripartite alliance to victory.While everyone focused on the bold numbers of LS polls of barely six months ago, he zeroed in on the granular details. Mahayuti’s vote share was a mere one per cent lower than MVA’s. If only two lakh more voters had voted for them, the picture would have been very different.It is precisely with this emphasis on smart poll management that Fadnavis, with a quiet resolve, went about planning the BJP’s election campaign and at the same time performing his role as Dy CM. Finally, he has returned, with a big bang – the BJP has posted its highest seat tally ever in Maharashtra with 132 seats.Fadnavis has, indeed, a point or two to prove. In 2019, the then CM Fadnavis had been BJP’s face for the state election campaign. He had even led the party’s Mahajanadesh yatra and made the famous ‘Me Punha Yein’ statement. It turned out to be quite a millstone around his neck, and he has been hoping for five years that he’d be able to cast it away.He helped BJP leadership engineer splits in the Shiv Sena and later in NCP and took it on the chin when he was appointed deputy to Eknath Shinde. His initial reluctance to be Shinde’s deputy was very visible. But like a loyal party worker he fell in line swallowing his ego and pride. All he did after that perceived diminishing of stature was to get back to work so that he could bounce back. He must be now hoping that the BJP top brass take cognizance of both his ‘sacrifice’ and subjucation of his claims to the chief ministership in the interests of the party and reward him with the top job five years around. His mother was quite vocal about her son’s credentials for the job post results.During the Maratha quota agitation, he was personally and consistently targeted by quota activist Manoj Jarange over his ‘Brahmin’ credentials. Though the LS poll debacle was a serious setback he led an aggressive assembly campaign, describing the state election as a ‘dharmayuddh.’This combination of silent, steady work with strong pronouncements has brought him back into the reckoning for the CM’s post, again. It is now up to the BJP supremos to decide whether to reward their tallest leader with the top job or, again, sacrifice Fadnavis for Shinde for the greater good of BJP in the longer term.",Fadnavis played a stellar role in leading the tripartite alliance to victory.

NEW DELHI: The vote counting for the Maharashtra assembly elections is underway, with early trends hinting at a fierce battle between the Mahayuti alliance and the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA). The Mahayuti, comprising the BJP, Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena, and Ajit Pawar’s NCP, is pitted against the MVA coalition of Congress, Shiv Sena (UBT), and Sharad Pawar-led NCP.Maharashtra’s 288 constituencies witnessed a voter turnout of 66.05%, reflecting increased public participation compared to 2019.Both alliances remain optimistic, interpreting the higher turnout as a sign of support for their respective coalitions.Key contests are drawing significant attention, including Deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis’s fight in Nagpur South West and a high-stakes battle in Wadala, where Shiv Sena (UBT)’s Shraddha Jadhav expressed confidence in her victory.As counting progresses, leads are emerging, with the Mahayuti gaining a landslide margin of over 220 seats in several constituencies.",Shahada (2) - Rajesh Udesing Padvi Nandurbar (3) - Dr. Vijaykumar Krushanrao Gavit Dhule Rural (6) - Raghavendra (Ramdada) Manohar Patil Dhule City (7) - Agrawal Anupbhaiyya Omprakash Sindkheda (8) - Jaykumar Jitendrasingh Rawal Shirpur (9),"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115585397,imgsize-938489,width-400,resizemode-4/115585397.jpg"
Maharashtra govt brings Rashmi Shukla back as director general of police (DGP),https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/maharashtra-govt-brings-rashmi-shukla-back-as-director-general-of-police-dgp/articleshow/115678000.cms,"Congress claims EC order on Shukla wrongly interpreted

MUMBAI: Rashmi Shukla was reinstated as director general of police ( DGP ) Monday, about three weeks after the Election Commission moved her out of the post following a complaint by the state Congress unit chief.Shukla's return came soon after the lifting of the model code of conduct that had been in force for the assembly election. ""Shukla's reinstatement is in accordance with the directives of the chief minister,"" a bureaucrat said.A 1988-batch IPS officer, Shukla was sent on compulsory leave following EC's directives on Nov 4.Soon after Rashmi Shukla was reinstated as DGP on Monday, the Congress cried foul. It said the EC had asked for her permanent removal fromthe post.The EC's Nov 4 order to shift her out of the office of DGP had come after a complaint lodged by MPCC president Nana Patole, whose contention was that in view of Shukla's ""doubtful integrity"" and her pro-BJP views, she should be removed from the top police post in the state.The EC had then asked the state govt to hand over charge of the DGP's office to Sanjay Verma.Shukla, whose retirement was due on June 30, was given a two-year extension in accordance with the guidelines prescribed in the Prakash Singh case, where it was directed that the DGP should enjoy a fixed tenure of two years.Patole had lodged a complaint with the EC against Shukla. He had even given a personal letter to chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar. Initially, Rajiv Kumar had taken the view that there was no substance in the complaint, since the appointment was as per the guidelines prescribed by the Supreme Court in the Prakash Singh case.Then, unexpectedly, the EC asked the state govt to immediately shift her out and entrust the charge to the senior-most IPS officer and submit a panel of senior IPS officers for appointment of DGP.The charge was then given to commissioner of police Vivek Phansalkar. A couple of days later, Verma was appointed DGP.MPCC spokesperson Atul Londhe said that there was a wrong interpretation of the EC's order. He said EC had asked the state govt remove her permanently and appoint a new DGP as per the guidelines prescribed by the apex court.He said that the home department instead sent her on leave till the code of conduct was in force, and hours after the code of conduct was withdrawn, she was reinstated. ""This is a violation of the EC order,"" Londhe said.","Shukla's return came soon after the lifting of the model code of conduct that had been in force for the assembly election. A 1988-batch IPS officer, Shukla was sent on compulsory leave following EC's directives on Nov 4.
