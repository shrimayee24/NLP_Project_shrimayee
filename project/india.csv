UP bypolls: BJP writes to EC, alleges 'fake voting' in Kundarki, Sisamau; SP claims police affecting voting in 9 seats



The Samajwadi Party (SP) has alleged police interference in the ongoing bypolls across all nine assembly constituencies in Uttar Pradesh. Meanwhile, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has raised concerns about ""fake voting"" in Kundarki (Moradabad) and Sisamau (Kanpur Nagar) constituencies in a letter to the Election Commission.

""We have lodged complaints about irregularities in various constituencies, including Karhal, Sisamau, Meerapur, Kundarki, Phulpur and Majhawan.

NEW DELHI: Voting commenced on Wednesday for bypolls in 15 assembly seats across Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Kerala, and Uttarakhand, with results scheduled to be announced on November 23.However, these bypolls are not expected to directly impact the composition of the respective legislative assemblies.In Uttar Pradesh, polling is taking place in Katehari, Karhal, Meerapur, Ghaziabad, Majhawan, Sisamau, Khair, Phulpur, and Kundarki, with 90 candidates contesting. Ghaziabad has the highest number of candidates at 14.The bypolls mark the first electoral challenge for both the INDIA bloc and the NDA in the state following the Lok Sabha elections.In the 2022 assembly elections, these seats were divided between the Samajwadi Party (SP), Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and BJP ally Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD).Punjab is seeing bypolls in Gidderbaha, Dera Baba Nanak, Chabbewal (SC), and Barnala. These bypolls were necessitated after the MLAs from these constituencies were elected to the Lok Sabha. Of the four seats, three were previously held by the Congress, while the Barnala seat belonged to the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).Forty-five candidates, including three women, are vying for these seats, with key contestants such as former Punjab finance minister and BJP nominee Manpreet Singh Badal, Congress's Amrita Warring, and AAP's Hardeep Singh Dimpy Dhillon in the fray.In Kerala, the bypoll in the Palakkad constituency was triggered by the election of Congress MLA Shafi Parambil to the Lok Sabha from Vadakara.In Uttarakhand, voters in Kedarnath are casting their ballots after the death of BJP MLA Shailarani Rawat. The seat has been a battleground between BJP's Asha Nautiyal and Congress's Manoj Rawat, both of whom have represented the constituency in the past.The Kedarnath constituency has 90,540 eligible voters, including 45,775 women.","The Election Commission ordered the suspension of police personnel in Uttar Pradesh for violating guidelines during the bypolls.

By 3pm, 42.29% polling was recorded.The seat fell vacant after incumbent SP MLA Lalji Verma was elected to Lok Sabha from Ambedkar Nagar.The bypoll was pitted as a direct contest between Verma's wife and SP nominee Shobhawati and BJP's Dharmraj Nishad, a three-time MLA who was also a minister during the Mayawati's govt. BSP has fielded Amit Kumar from the seat. Eight more contestants are in the fray.To ensure far polling, webcasting equipment and apparatus was installed across 219 booths to relay live images to the control room while video recording was done at 185 booths.The assembly constituency was divided into 65 sectors, and heavy deployment of administrative and police officials was done to ensure faire and peaceful polling.Some complaints by voters were raised in the minority dominated pockets and some other areas of the seat. Verma complained to the EC that police and administration were acting as the agents of BJP.Last time lotus (BJP) bloomed in the constituency was way back in 1991.Sharing its border with Ayodhya, Katehari is the only seat of Awadh region where bypoll was held. A victory here would help BJP overcome the setback of losing Faizabad (Ayodhya) Lok Sabha seat to some extent. By fielding a Nishad candidate, a community which has a sizeable vote bank in the region, BJP tried to woo Brahmins, Thakurs and other upper caste members.Some distance away in Pratappur Chamurkha gram sabha, one of the largest villages in the area, a group of people are countering Nishad's supporters by listing down Verma's contribution to the assembly segment.

While the family cited health issues, opposition Congress linked it to the ongoing fertiliser crisis.The victim, Bhagwat Kirar, owned 2 bighas of land in Jhagar village, around 220km from Bhopal.In the video posted on Sunday morning, he expressed frustration over the unavailability of fertilisers, claiming that he did not get ""even a grain of fertilizer"".""If fertilisers are distributed only through Aadhaar cards, it becomes impossible for small farmers like us to buy. The govt rate is Rs 1,350, but they sell it to us at Rs 3,000. A massive fraud is going on here,"" he alleged in the video, pleading with the authorities to ensure fair distribution and prevent corruption. ""Farmers should not be subjected to discrimination or forced to fight among ourselves,"" he said.The same night, he complained of chest pain and was taken to a local hospital, where doctors declared him dead.His family said he was unwell for some time and was recently treated for a blood clot in his head.However, no postmortem was conducted, as the family performed his last rites early Monday morning.State Congress president Jitu Patwari on Wednesday slammed the BJP govt in the state over the fertiliser shortage. He alleged that hapless farmers were committing suicide and appealing for euthanasia while the govt system collapsed. He described the recent deaths of farmers as ""murders committed by the govt"".He said Union agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan claimed he was a farmer's son. ""Even as chief minister for two decades, Chouhan promised to double the income of farmers. He often said farmers are his God. In Guna, a farmer identified as Bhagwat Kirar of Jhagar village with a small farm of two bighas gave a statement on video that he didn't receive a single grain of fertiliser,"" Patwari said.""He made the video on Sunday morning and died that night. The last rites of the deceased farmer were performed in a hurry without conducting a postmortem. Due to this, the real reason for death could not be revealed. Some people of the area are also calling it a case of suicide by a farmer troubled by not getting fertilisers,"" Patwari said.Reacting to Patwari's allegations, BJP state president VD Sharma said: ""Instead of playing politics in the name of farmers, Patwari should tell the people of the state what the Congress and the Kamal Nath govt, which was in power for 15 months, did for the farmers. Congress drowned farmers in debt with its false promises of waiving loans. It was the BJP govt that helped farmers recover from their debt situation.""Patwari further argued that last week, a 72-year-old farmer, Babulal Jat of Dagwanima village, committed suicide over a road dispute. His family protested by placing the body in front of the collector's bungalow in Harda.Two farmers of Gwalior district have appealed for euthanasia. One farmer has asked the President to save his land from local land grabbers, and the other farmer has asked for euthanasia permission from the Gwalior collector to save the grazing land of his village from the miscreants.""Despite having all the legal documents, the land of farmer Brijendra Singh Yadav of Baragaon village was encroached upon by goons. Another farmer, Kamta Prasad Kori of Maharajpura village, said orders were issued by the SDM court to free his land from encroachment. Even after the order, the Naib Tehsildar is demanding Rs 20,000 in exchange to remove the encroachment.""He said the acute fertiliser shortage is the biggest proof of the failure of the govt system in the state. ""According to NCRB, 1,318 farmers of the state committed suicide between 2017 and 2022, and the reason for their death in govt records is insanity, drug addiction, or family discord,"" he said.","Bhagwat Kirar owned 2 bighas of land in Jhagar village, around 220km from Bhopal.

On Wednesday, two female devotees, one from Rajasthan and another from Madhya Pradesh, fell ill while waiting at the temple gates.A day before, a 36-year-old woman from Indore fainted near Gate 1 of the temple after darshan but recovered after receiving treatment.In response to these incidents, the UP govt had formed a committee under former DGP Sulkhan Singh which had recommended construction of a temple corridor to control the crowds.In Nov last year, the Allahabad high court had approved the construction of the temple corridor modelled on Varanasi's Kashi Vishwanath Temple Corridor.With a projected cost of Rs 262 crore, the corridoris desi gned to accommodate over 10,000 devotees at a time.","Randhir Talwar, 72, died after suffering a cardiac arrest at the Banke Bihari Temple in Vrindavan.

Wednesday's numbers are likely to rise, at least marginally. The change in voter behaviour is reflected in the fact that in LS polls, Mumbai's turnout was 54.1% and Maharashtra's 61.3%. This flies in the face of the long-established convention that turnout for assembly polls is lower than for LS.

Mumbai's suburbs showed somewhat greater interest, at 55.8%.On Wednesday, the Naxal-affected district of Gadchiroli recorded the second-highest turnout of 73.7%, after Kolhapurat 76.3%.This is the first state election after the dramatic split of Shiv Sena and NCP which recast political alignments in Maharashtra. The election is considered a neck-and-neck fight between the governing Mahayuti and the opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA).While MVA won 30 of the 48 seats in the state in the Lok Sabha polls six months ago, some of the confidence that flowed from that impressive performance was deflated by BJP's unforeseen win in the Haryana polls in Oct.Several factors appear to have contributed to the higher turnout in Mumbai. EC had taken special efforts to improve turnout in urban areas. Not only was the election declared mid-week on a Wednesday but a holiday was also declared on polling day.A large number of housing societies in the state were allowed their own polling booths - 1,183 compared to 150 in the LS elections earlier this year.While the city reported no major incidents, polling day in parts of the state was tense with unprecedented skirmishes between opponents.",Mumbai recorded a three-decade record turnout of 54.8% according to EC's 11.30pm update.
