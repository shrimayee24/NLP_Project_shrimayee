PUNE: As suspense over the merger of the two NCPs continues, family patriarch Sharad Pawar on Wednesday met late nephew Ajit Pawar ’s wife Sunetra Pawar at her residence in Baramati for the first time after she took oath as Maharashtra’s deputy CM.Amid reports of a division in the family, Pawar, Sunetra, her sons Parth and Jay, and other relatives held a closed-door meeting in their hometown late Wednesday, reigniting the reunification buzz. Pawar Senior and his wife Pratibha offered condolences to Ajit Pawar’s family, and together, they all met locals who visited them.The NCP (SP) chief had, a few days ago, made his disappointment clear as he said Sunetra did not consult him about taking up the deputy CM’s post last week. However, he told reporters in Baramati on Wednesday morning he supported her decision. “I am happy that she was given the opportunity.” Despite ill health, he spent the entire day in a series of meetings in Baramati. Among these were a closed-door meeting with Sunetra’s sons and Ajit Pawar’s sister, Vijaya Patil, on Vidya Pratishthan campus.

Oppn Women MPs Storm Treasury Benches Amid Protests: Inside PM Modi's Lok Sabha Speech Cancellation

NEW DELHI: Congress on Wednesday said that the bigger issue was that leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi was not allowed to speak in the Lok Sabha rather than the prime minister not being able to do so, as the PM's reply depended on questions raised by the LoP, and without them, no debate could take place.Speaking to reporters after a meeting of Congress floor leaders, senior party leader Jairam Ramesh said, “If the LoP does not speak, what is the point of a debate? The prime minister replies to the debate. If the debate hasn’t taken place, what will the PM speak on?”He added, “We know the prime minister will make an election-style speech. That is what he has been doing for the last 11 years. He will criticise the Congress and its leadership, and target Nehru. But a proper debate starts with the LoP, who has not been allowed to speak.”The meeting at Rajya Sabha member Mallikarjun Kharge’s residence was attended by Ramesh, Congress general secretary in-charge of organisation K C Venugopal, Pramod Tewari, Manickam Tagore and other leaders.Later, Ramesh wrote on X, “To recall and remind, on June 10, 2004, the prime minister was prevented by the BJP from speaking on the Motion of Thanks to the President’s address.”The Lok Sabha saw dramatic scenes on Wednesday as women opposition MPs marched towards the Treasury benches holding banners just before Prime Minister Modi ’s scheduled reply. The MPs blocked the seats in the treasury bench, including the seat of the Prime Minister. Following this, the speaker adjourned the House, cancelling Prime Minister Narendra Modi's response to the debate on the Motion of Thanks to the President’s Address.","The Lok Sabha saw dramatic scenes on Wednesday as women opposition MPs marched towards the Treasury benches holding banners.
