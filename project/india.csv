Why caste quota is a hot button in Karnataka politics,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-caste-quota-is-a-hot-button-in-karnataka-politics/articleshow/109708762.cms,"National Scene

PM Modi may have sparked a row by accusing Congress of snatching reservation from OBCs and SC/STs to give it to Muslims , but in Karnataka, which he cited as an example, the issue has dominated multiple elections, including the 2023 assembly polls that Congress won.In fact, the action in Karnataka precedes the demand for a caste census by Congress MP Rahul Gandhi and AICC president Mallikarjun Kharge, which came on the heels of a statewide survey in Bihar.Responding to the PM’s criticism, Kharge told TOI: “While it is popularly being called a caste census, what we are proposing to do is a socioeconomic and educational survey that aims to assess and identify communities eligible for welfare schemes. We’ve already implemented several schemes like MGNREGA, which aren’t based on caste but on needs of all communities. Modi is making the issue communal solely for electoral gain.”Karnataka has been at the forefront of the caste survey issue — much like with ‘guarantees’ this season — and a report on it was submitted by a commission headed by Jayaprakash Hegde, now Congress candidate from UdupiChikmagalur. The Siddaramaiah govt accepted the report but is yet to implement its recommendations.Campaign plots of LS polls in Karnataka include the OBC narrative. If Siddaramaiah with his Ahinda credentials is Congress’s lead actor, BJP has been projecting PM Modi as the OBC face.Shivaraj Thangadagi, Karnataka backward classes welfare minister, told TOI: “Our govt has done what none had before by accepting the report. Its implementation will not only benefit backward communities but also the party, for sticking to its commitment. The concerns of other communities will be addressed while implementing this.”Union home minister Amit Shah and Karnataka leader of opposition R Ashoka have reiterated how BJP was with OBCs with Modi being “sabse bada (biggest) OBC” during their campaigns in the state.Nationally, Nitish Kumar — who had commissioned the Bihar caste survey — leaving INDIA and Congress being concerned about caste matrices across states may have seen the party use the OBC card cautiously, but it has included it in its national manifesto, while BJP continues to actively woo these communities.“Congress didn’t tolerate leaders from extremely backward classes. In 1987, Congress refused to accept Karpoori Thakurji as opposition leader whom we honoured a few days ago with Bharat Ratna. These days, Congress colleagues express concern about the number of people from backward classes in govt, where they’re positioned… But I’m surprised they don’t notice the biggest OBC (referring to himself),” Modi told Parliament on Feb 5.The PM referring to himself as the biggest OBC came close on the heels of Rahul claiming that Modi’s Teli caste was not part of other backward classes.India’s first proper caste enumeration was under the British in 1931. Subsequently, while the Constitution addressed education and job reservations for SC/STs, the first independent govt realised there were numerous underprivileged backward commu nities, resulting in the Kaka Kalekar commission in 1953, which recommended a castewise census enumeration in the 1961 Census.But it was Mandal Commission’s 1980 report that proved pivotal, identifying 3,742 OBC communities and recommending 52% quotas — though only 27% reservations were implemented by V P Singh’s govt in 1989 amid violent protests and legal battles.A landmark 1993 Supreme Court judgment (Indira Sawhney case) capped overall reservations at 50% but allowed exceptions. It also introduced the ‘creamy layer’ excluded from reservation, based on annual income limits, currently Rs 8 lakh.Karnataka Pioneers Mysore ruler Nalvadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar appointed the Leslie Miller commission to examine non-Brahmin underrepresentation in 1918, despite opposition from then Divan M Visvesvaraya.Post-Independence, Nagana Gowda Commission (1960) recommended 45% job and 50% education quotas for OBCs, excluding Lingayats, which prevented implementation. Then, the 1975 LG Havanur panel raised the quantum to 32% across the three categories it introduced. But the exclusion of Lingayats again caused friction.To address this, the T Venkataswamy commission was formed, which, in its 1986 re port, included some Lingayat sub-castes and, again, the 1990 O Chinnappa Reddy commission included Muslims, Vokkaligas and Lingayats, but the latter two were dissatisfied with the representation. This finally led to creation of a permanent BC commission, with the first in 1994 led by Kudur Narayana Pai.The Chinnappa Reddy report recommendation was implemented in 1994-95 and has since been used as the matrix for reservations in the state.And in 2015, CM Siddaramaiah set up the H Kantharaju commission to carry out a socio-economic educational survey, commonly called caste survey. While Siddaramaiah’s tenure ended before the report could be submitted, leaked contents created heartburn among Vokkaligas and Lingayats. Subsequent govts didn’t accept the report citing reasons, including a technicality that the membersecretary hadn’t signed it. This prompted the Jayaprakash Hegde commission to revisit the Kantharaju panel report. The Hegde commission has since submitted its report to the Siddaramaiah govt.In between, BJP’s Basavaraj Bommai govt had in Dec 2022 rejigged the categories based on which existing reservation was being implemented. It removed Muslims and added an additional quota for Vokkaligas and Lingayats. But its implementation is stalled as a case is pending before Supreme Court.",Karnataka has been at the forefront of the caste survey issue. A report on it was submitted by a commission headed by Jayaprakash Hegde. The Siddaramaiah govt accepted the report but is yet to implement its recommendations.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109708776,imgsize-64038,width-400,resizemode-4/109708776.jpg"

BALAKOT: PM Modi revealed on Monday the untold story of how he ensured Pakistan was the first to officially hear about the 2019 Balakot airstrike, linking it to BJP-governed “new India’s policy of looking an adversary in the eye and speaking the truth rather than resorting to stealth”.“I instructed our forces to notify media about the airstrike , albeit after I had informed Pakistani authorities over phone that we have carried out an airstrike, killed these many people and caused this much destruction.But they wouldn’t take calls,” he said at a rally in Navanagar in Bagalkot, north Karnataka. “I then directed the forces to postpone disclosure until after I managed to contact them... Modi doesn’t believe in hiding or attacking from behind, he fights openly.”PM Modi harked back to Balakot in Bagalkot, recounting with amusement initial rumours about an airstrike happening in the similar-sounding north Karnataka district after word got out of warplanes hitting terror targets.The Navanagar rally, Modi’s fifth campaign stop in north Karnataka in 24 hours, saw him doubling down, once again, on his tirade against Congress for its votebank politics, including “reservation for Muslims” in violation of the Constitution.Modi said Congress snatched slices of the quota pie from Dalits, SC/STs and OBCs and handed these to Muslims by putting them on the OBC list. “BJP is ramping up the share of SC/ST/OBCrepresentation by encouraging them to enter public life, which Congress is unable to tolerate.”He said the Siddaramaiah govt had “stooped so low” as to collect money even from tanker owners supplying water to parched areas of Bengaluru.Modi started his speech in Kannada, invoking the deity Badami Banashankari, saint Basavanna and Siddeshwar Swamiji of Jnanayogashrama.When a girl in the audience, later identified as Nagaratna Meti, held up an image of the PM with his late mother Heeraben Modi, he asked an SPG commando to get him the photo with the child’s name and address on it, and promised to write to her. Party candidates PC Gaddigoudar (Bagalkot) and Ramesh Jigajinagi (Bijapur) shared the dais along with BJP ’s state president BY Vijayendra, former CM BS Yediyurappa, and a few ex-ministers.North Karnataka will vote during the third phase of elections on May 7.","PM Modi reveals how he ensured Pakistan was the first to officially hear about the 2019 Balakot airstrike. “I instructed our forces to notify media about the airstrike, albeit after I had informed Pakistani authorities over phone that we have carried out an airstrike, killed these many people and caused this much destruction,” he said at a rally.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109708393,imgsize-1460174,width-400,resizemode-4/109708393.jpg"

The CM’s retort came minutes after Delhi Police served notices on him and four other Congress members over an alleged doctored video of Shah.Revanth has been targeting BJP govt’s policies and had called Modi “a cobra” three days ago at a public meeting in Zahirabad Lok Sabha constituency. He used the word “cobra” to drive home his claim that Modi holds grudges and would make farmers pay for compelling him to retract the three contentious farm laws and for apologising to them.When Delhi Police arrived in Hyderabad, the TPCC president was away, campaigning in Sedam, in Karnataka’s Gulbarga Lok Sabha constituency, along with AICC president Mallikarjun Kharge and AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi. “I just received information from Telangana Congress office (Gandhi Bhavan) in Hyderabad that Delhi Police came to arrest me.

This presupposition is completely unjustified. It is not permissible for this court to direct EC to take a particular view on the petitioner complaint or any other complaint for that matter and issue peremptory directions as sought by the petitioner,” the court noted.It underlined that EC is obliged to take an independent view on the complaint of the petitioner and if he is aggrieved by it, he is free to take the recourse of appropriate remedy available under the law. During the hearing, advocate Sidhant Kumar, representing EC, said the commission is receiving complaints every day and is processing these. Similarly, appropriate orders will be passed on the current plea. The petition said the PM delivered a speech in Pilibhit, Uttar Pradesh, on April 9 where he “not only sought votes in the name of Hindu and Sikh deities and their places of worship but also made comments against opposition political parties as favouring Muslims.”He sought to restrain the prime minister from seeking votes in the name of religious deities and places of worship.The petitioner had HC to act against Modi for allegedly seeking votes in the name of gods and places of worship, saying this amounted to violating the MCC.","Petitioner Anand S Jondhale, a lawyer, had urged the court to act against Modi for allegedly seeking votes in the name of gods and places of worship.

I am committed to upholding that policy for all oppressed classes, SCs, STs and OBCs.”Modi, who had famously spoken about the new generation having to right the wrongs of previous generations while referring to social justice during a December 2015 speech in Parliament, said the only thing he would always oppose was reservation on religious lines, as envisioned by Congress.At Satara, his next campaign stops in the region, the PM said he could give in writing that Congress’s attempt to expand nationwide the “Karnataka model” of granting reservation to all Muslims through the OBC quota would fail. “Till Modi is alive, he won’t allow such a reservation policy.”Citing schemes undertaken by the NDA govt for the uplift of Dalits and other backward communities, he said over 25 crore such people had come out of poverty in the past decade.“Neeyat sahi hai to natije bhi sahi milte hai (an honest motive will yield a positive result),” the PM added.","PM Modi said he had never wanted to revoke reservations.

BENGALURU: While campaigning for the second phase of Lok Sabha polls in Karnataka is on at full steam, major parties are planning to change the poll narrative and focus on regional issues.Senior Congress functionaries said people’s issues, such as pending irrigation projects like Mahadayi and Upper Bhadra, will be in focus. They say it’s a strategy to neutralise the impact of BJP ’s narrative centred on “wealth distribution”.| While attacking Congress’ manifesto and the caste census, PM Narendra Modi has alleged that Congress is trying to take away reservation meant for OBCs and give it to Muslims. Even on Monday, when he wrapped up his Karnataka campaign with a rally in Bagalkot, Modi said BJP would never allow Congress to implement religion-based reservation.“BJP, as usual, is trying to communalise these elections,” said a senior Congress MLC, who is in-charge of the campaign in Haveri and Dharwad Lok Sabha constituencies. “We will appeal to people not to fall into the trap. While our agenda is to uplift the poor through welfare schemes like guarantees, our campaign in North Karnataka will mainly focus on burning issues such as drought and irrigation projects, which have come to a standstill because of the BJP govt’s apa thy to Karnataka.”The BJP govt, in its 2023-24 budget, had proposed to declare the Upper Bhadra irrigation project as a national project and earmarked Rs 5,300 crore for it. However, the Centre is yet to issue notification to this effect. Also, Mahadayi irrigation project envisaging supply of drinking water to four districts in north Karnataka — Belagavi, Gadag, Dharwad — has also been a bone of contention as clearances from the Centre are pending despite the Supreme Court upholding the tribunal award.| Congress functionaries say they would highlight this issue during the rallies in Kittur Karnataka and Kalyana Karnataka later this week where party brass including Rahul Gandhi are expected to campaign.“Water projects are the main poll issue in North Karnataka as the BJP govt has denied people of this region their right,” said Basavaraj Rayaredi, chairman of Congress campaign Prajadhvani 2. “During the first phase, we highlighted how the Centre dithered on drought relief. Now, we will talk about the irrigation projects.”On its part, BJP plans to highlight “corruption” of the Congress-led state govt and, in the wake of the Neha Hiremath murder case, its failure to ensure law and order in the state.Union home minister Amit Shah is scheduled to visit Hubballi, Haveri and surrounding districts on Wednesday.“We will continue attacking Congress on its manifesto that fosters appeasement politics,” said BJP state general secretary P Rajiv. “But the main focus of our campaign will be corruption of the Congress govt and its failure to maintain law and order.”","Major parties are planning to change the poll narrative and focus on regional issues.

His residence may have preserved its heritage, but Suri still rues the changes in the decades.“There was a time when I used to play cricket here, but now there is not enough space even for guests to park their cars,” said Suri.“The population has increased more than 10 times, but the civic infrastructure has remained the same.”Though many of his friends are vocal about their admiration for PM Narendra Modi and CM Arvind Kejriwal, as the case may be, Suri himself only enumerates the problems of daily life in Delhi: burglaries, pollution, parking disputes, sanitation.It seems a different world in Dasghara village, not far from Rajinder Nagar, where 20-year-old Sanjana cradles her six-month-old baby. A neighbour enquires about the water supply. “Water has finally come,” Sanjana said, before telling TOI. “Bijli toh issi sarkar ke time se theek huye hai, but meethe pani ka issue abhi bhi hai aur roads ki halat aap dekh hi rahe hain.”Dasghara's broken roads and littered lanes contrast sharply with the upscale South Extension in the New Delhi Lok Sabha constituency. As BJP champions nationalism and Modi’s Vikaspurush image and AAP calls the polls a referendum on Kejriwal’s arrest, both Suri and Sanjana, from starkly different backgrounds, talked of issues rather than leaders. Yet, college student Nakul of Malviya Nagar doubts issues will dominate the elections . At the same time, there’s also the dilemma of finalising which leader to support. “Yaha sab khud me leader hain, sab apne mobile me pura din videos dekhte aur apne hisab se sochte,” he observed.The New Delhi constituency, with 14 lakh voters, has been represented by BJP’s Meenakshi Lekhi for the past two terms. The current contest has pitted Bansuri Swaraj, daughter of saffron stalwart Sushma Swaraj, against AAP’s three-term MLA Somnath Bharti. AAP is hopeful this time because of its alliance with Congress.The constituency has large chunk of Punjabi voters in areas like Rajinder Nagar, Greater Kailash, Patel Nagar and Moti Nagar, while commercial areas like Karol Bagh have sizable trader populations. There are Jats in villages like Shahpur Jat and Poorvanchali people in pockets like Naraina.There is also a large population of govt employees living in Kaka Nagar, Lodhi Road, Gole Market and DDU Marg. A legal officer working with govt said at Gole Market, “Congestion, encroachment of footpaths and traffic problems are constant. There are also instances of electricity being stolen by e-rickshaw vehicles for recharging batteries.” She added, “There seems to be support for Bansuri Swaraj,” and added, after a pause, “but events like CM’s arrest will also influence public opinion.""Congestion is indeed a concern across the expansive constituency. But there are other common-man complaints too. Mudit Mathur, who lives in Khirki Extension, laments the lack of space and greenery, underscoring the citizens’ frustration with the unchanged ground realities. “Do you see a tree here? There’s no park, no playground; it is all so congested,” he said.The parties, however, are not focusing on caste and community as much as CM’s arrest and free services, on one hand, and central govt boost to infrastructure and the Ram temple, on the other. So will voters focus on leaders and personalities or daily-life conveniences? Only the EVM machines will show the answers.","The New Delhi constituency, with 14 lakh voters, has been represented by BJP’s Meenakshi Lekhi for the past two terms.

to leader of opposition in East Delhi Municipal Corporation and an MLA's post from Kondli -

Kuldeep Kumar

has come a long way. And though a scheduled caste, he has been given a ticket from an unreserved constituency. Excerpts from an interview:

What are the main election issues in East Delhi?

AAP lost the last two MP elections here and BJP has done relatively well in east Delhi in both assembly and municipal elections.

Do you think the alliance with Congress will help?

What kind of coordination do you have with Congress on the ground?

What are your views on your rival here?

How do you counter the questions about the arrest and alleged involvement of CM Arvind Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia in the excise policy case?

Why did AAP select you to contest this election?

Law and order is a huge problem.Drug abuse has taken the shape of a pandemic. My priority will be to rehabilitate addicted children and put a stop to the sale of narcotics. Murders and rapes are also frequent in East Delhi. When Gautam Gambhirji was MP, the committee on law and order rarely met. I will make that committee active. I will also work as a bridge between Delhi govt and Delhi Development Authority. Delhi govt has a lot of funds and my responsibility will be to get land from DDA for hospitals, schools, community centres, libraries and mohalla clinics. I will also try to bring Delhi Metro to areas such as Mayur Vihar Phase III. Regularisation of unauthorised colonies and clearing the Ghazipur landfill are also priorities. I also commit to be available to people 24x7.People are complaining that their MP never visited their area in the last decade. The constituency saw no development. I have the benefit of the lack of work done by the last two BJP MPs. (Former deputy CM) Manish Sisodiaji brought about a revolution in the education sector and I will reap its benefit too. Also, BJP failed to fulfil its promises of providing two crore jobs, checking price rise, providing pucca houses to the poor and depositing Rs 15 lakh in everyone's bank account.Yes, being in alliance will definitely make a difference. There is a strong vote bank in Delhi now supporting the alliance candidates.You can see one of their block presidents sitting with me (points towards a man who claimed to be from the Laxmi Nagar unit of Congress). This election is not about making Kuldeep Kumar win from East Delhi; it is about saving the Constitution, saving democracy. On one side there is an alliance which promises to give employment, bring down inflation and provide farmers with minimum support price for their crops. On the other are people talking about changing the Constitution and running the country under a dictatorship.BJP announced its candidate more than a month ago, but he is still holding introductory meetings. If somebody who has been a mayor needs an introduction, one realises he has never worked on the ground.People understand that Arvind Kejriwalji, Manishji and other party functionaries have been jailed in fabricated cases to crush AAP. People stand with us on the issue of the wrongful arrest of Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia. People in Haryana, UP and other states have started asking if Delhi can get free and 24x7 power or free water, why can't they?The party commissioned a survey and my name emerged on this basis of the work I have done earlier as a municipal councillor and then as MLA.",Kuldeep Kumar is a scheduled caste but has been given a ticket from an unreserved constituency.

From a national perspective, how crucial is this election?

Although this is his first election, Mrinal Hebbalkar , son of women and child welfare minister Laxmi Hebbalkar and Congress ’ candidate for Belgaum Lok Sabha segment, insists electioneering is not new to him. He says the May 7 is crucial for democracy to thrive. Excerpts from an interview.■ My interest in politics was sparked when my mother contested an election.It provided me with an opportunity to engage in public life. The decision to enter politics was not personal or familial, but rather a collective opinion of the people around me. I have worked with my mother for many years now. I have solicited votes on her behalf during campaigns. So, politics isn’t new to me, but yes attempting to become an MP is a huge responsibility.■ A priority is to ensure Union govt schemes are accessible to the people of this constituency. It hasn’t been for the past 20 years due to lethargy of MPs from Belgaum. The best example is Dakshina Kannada district which has 97 Janaushadhi Kendras. But Belagavi, the second largest district, has just 17. It is the responsibility of the local representative to ensure these schemes are delivered to the people.■ The primary factor that will work in my favour is lethargy of Belgaum MPs over the past 20 years. Promises made by previous MPs remain unfulfilled. The previous MP promised to bring MNC companies and construct a hightech swimming pool in Belagavi (South assembly) constituency, but these promises have not been fulfilled. People want change.■ My mother fought for Panchamasali reservation and participated in padayatras. We have taken every community into confidence. Our focus is not limited to Panchamasalis, but to bring all communities on board.■ I can count what the past three chief ministers, including BS Yediyurappa, have done for Belagavi but I can’t remember a single work Shettar did for this constituency. During the pandemic, Shettar was industries and Belagavi district minister. The industrial fraternity requested him to allow industries to operate. But he refused. Yet, he permitted industries to run in Hubballi. Because of this decision, some 15,000 labourers faced big problems. He has used all his experience against Belagavi so far.■ I’ve never targeted anyone on a personal level. This is not the culture of my family. MP Mangala Angadi accused me of speaking to her badly and used the woman card. I ask her, why did she not utter a word when BJP MLAs insulted my mother? She was sitting on stage and laughed at that time.■ Not giving false assurances to people and standing by what I say.■ We are a large country of different cultures, religions, and languages, so we need a healthy democracy to bind us. For the past 10 years, people have been gradually losing their freedom. Every institution from media to the Supreme Court, is under pressure. The voice of the opposition is being suppressed.

INDORE: In a stunning blow to Congress, its Indore candidate Akshay Kanti Bam withdrew his nomination for the Lok Sabha election on Monday morning and joined BJP , just hours after leading a Congress campaign rally.BJP's sitting MP Shankar Lalwani now has no real challenger left in Indore. It's the first time ever that Congress doesn't have a candidate in this prestigious seat.This is the second constituency in MP where BJP has got a near walkover after Khajuraho , where the SP candidate forgot to sign the nomination papers.PCC chief Jitu Patwari, who is also from Indore, accused BJP of pressure politics. ""Recently a case of attempted murder was registered against Bam in an old case. He was terrorized by various means and forced to withdraw the nomination,"" Patwari said in Gwalior.On April 24, a local court had ordered addition of attempt-to-murder charges against Bam in a 17-year-old case in Indore's Khajrana area. BJP had, in fact, objected to Bam's nomination on the day of scrutiny, referring to this court order and accusing him of hiding facts in the affidavit.Bam sprung the last-minute surprise on Congress after seeking votes for himself under the party banner on Monday morning - the last day for withdrawal of nominations. Towards afternoon, he suddenly vanished. Concern began mounting in the Congress camp. Congress workers were stunned when Bam was seen entering the district election office, escorted by BJP MLA Ramesh Mendola. Outside, waiting in an SUV, was state minister Kailash Vijayvargiya.Bam, a moneyed businessman, ignored mediapersons' questions after stepping out of the election office. Less than an hour later, Vijayvargiya posted a photograph on X showing him, Bam and Mendola, all smiles in a car.Congress and BJP workers came to blows at the election office.Rubbing salt into Congress's wounds, Bam announced that he was impressed by PM Narendra Modi's Modi's 'Ek Bharat, Shrestha Bharat' concept.In Congress, there was confusion, bedlam and plenty of finger-pointing, mostly at PCC chief Jitu Patwari.Congress working president of Indore, Devendra Singh, fumed: ""Bam was campaigning in Choithram Mandi area with me in the morning. He betrayed the party in the afternoon. I'd always questioned the party's decision to ignore genuine and dedicated party leaders and field Bam, solely on the basis of his wealth. I had predicted that he would withdraw.""Vijayvargiya later hosted a joint press conference with Bam, who said his goal ""remains the same"". ""I have just changed my path. I have chosen the path where there are people with patriotism to reach the goals,"" Bam said.Congress will now have to find someone among the 13 non-BJP contestants left in the fray to support. Indore votes on May 13.","Congress candidate Akshay Kanti Bam withdraws his nomination for Lok Sabha election. Bam, a moneyed businessman, had led a Congress campaign rally in Indore.

Efforts were made by Digvijaya to dissuade the MLA from leaving Congress, with a series of meetings held for this purpose, sources said. The outcome of these efforts remains to be seen on Tuesday.Aligned with Jyotiraditya Scindia’s faction, the party functionary remained with Congress when Scindia joined BJP in March 2020 along with 22 MLAs, leading to the downfall of the Kamal Nath-led govt. He wasn’t an MLA then. However, after becoming an MLA, sources said he has been cosying up to BJP.If the defection happens, it would mark the second Congress MLA to quit within six months following the assembly elections. On March 29, Kamlesh Shah, a three-time MLA for Amarwara in Chhindwara, left Congress to join BJP.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi is scheduled to arrive in Gwalior from New Delhi around 11.50am on Tuesday.
