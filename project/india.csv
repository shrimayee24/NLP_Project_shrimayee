NEW DELHI: The seat-sharing negotiations for upcoming assembly elections in Bihar have become more complex as two new parties - Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and Pashupati Paras's LJP faction - joined the Mahagathbandhan alliance. The situation is getting trickier as major parties are firm on their seat demands.The 243 seats will now be divided among eight parties -- Rashtriya Janata Dal, Congress, CPI, CPM, VIP, LJP (Paras) and JMM.“Two more parties are expected to be part of the INDIA bloc soon and we all have to sacrifice our share of seats to accommodate the new partners.” State Congress president Rajesh Kumar told reporters after a discussion during a key meeting of INDIA bloc leaders at the official residence of RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav.Meanwhile, Congress insist that it cannot go below the 70 seats.VIP chief Mukesh Sahani, on the other hand, has demanded “60 seats plus the post of deputy CM” while the CPI-ML is pressing for at least 40 seats, pointing to its past performance.The RJD is also unwilling to contest on fewer than 150 seats.In 2020 assembly elections, Rashtriya Janata Dal had contested on 144 seats, of which it won 75.Congress won 19 out of 70 seats.CPI-ML contested 19 seats and won 12.CPM contested 4 seats and was successful in winning 2 seats.CPI contested on 6 seats and won 2 seats.RJD's Tejashwi Yadav has already declared himself as the CM face of the opposition INDIA bloc.Addressing the rally in Ara town, the last stopover of the 'Voter Adhikar Yatra', Tejashwi questioned the Nitish Kumar government in Bihar for ""frequently copying his ideas"" and described it as a ""copycat government"". Ridiculing the government for copying his ideas, he said that at present he was moving ahead while the govt was behind him.""Tejashwi aage-aage, Sarkar pichhe-pichhe. Original CM chahiye ki duplicate?"" (Tejashwi is moving ahead while the govt is following him from behind. Do you want a duplicate CM or the original CM?), Tejashwi asked the crowd.","Two new parties - Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and Pashupati Paras's LJP faction - joined the Mahagathbandhan alliance.

Dialogue war erupts in Andhra assembly over TDP MLA Balakrishna's 'psycho' remarks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/why-forget-such-acts-of-generosity-dialogue-war-erupts-in-andhra-assembly-over-tdp-mlas-psycho-remarks/articleshow/124176117.cms,"



NEW DELHI: The Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly witnessed heated exchanges after Telugu Desam Party (TDP) MLA and veteran actor Nandamuri Balakrishna called former chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy a ""psycho"" during Assembly proceedings on Thursday, following a debate initiated by BJP MLA Kamineni Srinivas about the previous YSRCP government's alleged neglect of the Telugu film industry.The controversy erupted when Srinivas claimed that film industry representatives had difficulty meeting Jagan during his tenure as chief minister until megastar Chiranjeevi intervened.Balakrishna's interruption and controversial remarks against Jagan drew immediate condemnation from YSRCP leaders, who called his behavior disgraceful and unbecoming of a legislator.""The Assembly is not a movie set for film-style dialogues,"" responded a YSRCP leader, criticizing Balakrishna for undermining the House's dignity.Former minister Perni Venkatramaiah (Nani) defended Jagan by highlighting instances of his support to Balakrishna, including assistance during the release of Akhanda and a firing incident at Balakrishna's residence.""Why forget such acts of generosity? Is political gain more important than decency?"" Nani questioned.Chiranjeevi issued a clarification about his role in addressing industry concerns during Jagan's tenure.He confirmed meeting Jagan over lunch after coordinating with then-Minister Perni Nani.""Jagan listened with patience and responded positively,"" Chiranjeevi stated, noting that the subsequent revision in ticket pricing policy benefited films including Waltair Veerayya and Veera Simha Reddy.The clarification contradicted claims by TDP and Janasena leaders about Jagan's alleged dismissive attitude toward Tollywood.YSRCP leaders Ambati Rambabu and Margani Bharat criticized Chandrababu Naidu, Nara Lokesh, Pawan Kalyan, and Balakrishna for allegedly spreading false narratives.""The truth has come out. Jagan always stood with the film industry. This opportunistic politics must end,"" stated Margani Bharat.The incident highlighted the ongoing political tensions in Andhra Pradesh, where even cinema-related matters become subjects of intense political debate.","Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly witnessed heated exchanges after Telugu Desam Party (TDP) MLA Nandamuri Balakrishna called former chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy a ""psycho"" The controversy erupted when Srinivas claimed that film industry representatives had difficulty meeting Jagan during his tenure as chief minister.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124176213,imgsize-1228117,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/dialogue-war-erupts-in-andhra-assembly-over-tdp-mla39s-39psycho39-remarks.jpg"
