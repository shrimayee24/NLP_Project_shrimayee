However, the timing of his switch, on the same day BJP ran advertisements accusing Congress of being anti-Dalit, has become a talking point.Just hours before his re-entry into Congress, Tanwar had campaigned for BJP's Ram Kumar Gautam in Jind district.He had been actively stumping for the party across multiple constituencies. On Wednesday, Tanwar was in Hisar's Nalwa seat, where he campaigned for BJP's Randhir Panihar and criticised Congress for ""spreading misinformation about Modi govt with foreign funding"". While campaigning for BJP, he said: ""Congress has always used Dalits for vote banks... It is time that people teach Congress a lesson.""Tanwar deleted all his social media posts criticising the Congress party after switching sides.His political career has seen him move through several parties over the past few years. He joined BJP on Jan 20, following his departure from AAP, and was fielded from Sirsa (reserved) seat in Lok Sabha elections, replacing sitting BJP MP Sunita Duggal. However, he lost to Congress's Kumari Selja. Tanwar had joined AAP in April 2022. AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal had appointed him chairman of the party's election campaign committee. However, he quit in Jan 2023, citing his discomfort with AAP's growing alignment with Congress.His brief stint in AAP followed an earlier jump to Trinamool Congress in Nov 2021. Before that, Tanwar had launched his own political outfit, Apna Bharat Morcha, in Feb 2021, after resigning from Congress in 2019. He had been a member of Congress for decades, starting as president of NSUI and later leading Youth Congress. He became Sirsa MP in 2009 and served as Haryana Pradesh Congress Committee president from 2014 to 2019 but left the party due to 'disputes' with Hooda.","Tanwar had been actively stumping for the party across multiple constituencies.

Badlapur school assault case:Bombay HC orders inquiry into custodial death of accused Akshay Shinde,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/badlapur-school-assault-casebombay-hc-orders-inquiry-into-custodial-death-of-akshay-shinde/articleshow/113902053.cms,"The court emphasized collecting and preserving forensic evidence after Shinde was allegedly killed in a police shoot-out. The inquiry report must be submitted by November 18

MUMBAI: Bombay High Court on Thursday directed that the report of the magistrate’s inquiry into the death of the accused in the Badlapur school sexual assault case shall be placed before it on Nov 18.Justices Revati Mohite-Dere and Prithviraj Chavan passed the direction while hearing a petition by the father of the accused, seeking a probe by a special investigation team into the “murder” of his son, registration of an FIR against erring officers, preservation of CCTV footage, and compensation.The incident took place on the Mumbra bypass after 6 pm on Sept 23 during a scuffle the accused had with the police. The accused was declared dead at 7.52 pm at Chhatrapati Shivaji Hospital, Kalwa.Advocate General Birendra Saraf, with Public Prosecutor Hiten Venegavkar, informed that the post-mortem report and inquest panchnama have been forwarded to the chief judicial magistrate. Saraf said other documents will also be forwarded.The judges directed that all necessary documents required for the inquiry shall be forwarded to the magistrate. “Needless to say, the learned magistrate will commence the inquiry no sooner on receiving the documents,” they added. The judges also directed that the father and all concerned persons will be heard in the inquiry. On Nov 18, the judges may consider granting the magistrate an extension of time if required.Saraf said that pursuant to the Sept 25 order, all directions have been complied with. He said the State CID has collected evidence. The judges had further questions regarding the collection of evidence. They asked whether fingerprints of the accused were taken from the bottle from which he drank water when one handcuff was unlocked, whether gunshot residue was picked and preserved, and whether empty shells were found from pistols fired by the accused and a police officer.They also asked whether police officer Nilesh More was injured by bullets fired by the deceased or by a different gun.The father’s advocate said from the FIR there is sufficient reason to believe that it was a fake encounter. “An FIR is not an encyclopaedia. It puts the criminal law into motion,” said Justice Chavan. The judges said therefore it is necessary to wait for the magistrate’s report into the inquiry into the custodial death . The judges again admonished the advocate for his statements to the media, saying, “You will be doing a disservice to your client by doing all this.”They disposed of the father’s interim application seeking land for the burial of his son. The accused was buried at Ulhasnagar crematorium on Sept 29. While Saraf said police in uniform have been deputed in the vicinity of their residence, the judges directed the police to consider the father’s application for police protection.","Justices Revati Mohite-Dere and Prithviraj Chavan passed the direction while hearing a petition by the father of the accused.

"Haryana assembly elections 2024: Campaign ends, all set for BJP vs Congress contest",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/haryana-assembly-elections-haryana-elections-bhupinder-singh-hooda-nayab-singh-saini-rahul-gandhi-pm-modi-haryana-polls/articleshow/113912319.cms,"NEW DELHI: Will people of Haryana give ruling BJP consecutive third term in office or will the Congress snatch power from the saffron party after staying in opposition for 10 years? With campaign for the October 5 assembly elections for the 90-member assembly drawing to a close, the stage is set for an interesting contest that will decide the fate of the two contenders.Both the BJP and the Congress went all out with a very aggressive campaign to woo the people of Haryana. While the BJP is banking on its development report card of 10 years, the Congress is trying to capitalise on anti-incumbency and on issues like the farmers protest and the Agnipath Scheme - which provides short-term recruitment in armed forces.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who led the BJP campaign, is confident that the Congress will fall flat on October 8 when the votes are counted. In a post on X, PM Modi said that he has observed the enthusiasm and support for the BJP after travelling all over the state.""The campaign for the Haryana assembly elections will end shortly. I have travelled all over the state in the last few days. The enthusiasm I have seen among the people gives me full confidence that the people of Haryana will once again give their blessings to the BJP. The patriotic people of Haryana will never accept the divisive and negative politics of the Congress,"" the Prime Minister said.PM Modi also blasted the Congress for its alleged divisive and negative politics and said the patriotic people of the state will never accept it. ""The Congress means a syndicate of fixers and son-in-law,"" he said in an apparent reference to controversial land deals involving Congress leader Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law Robert Vadra when the party was in power during 2004-14. He also targeted Bhupinder Singh Hooda and his MP son Deepender Singh Hooda and alleged that the main goal of father-son politics is only self-interest. Modi called the Congress a ""party of 'dalalon' (middlemen) and 'damadon'"".The Prime Minister held 4 rallies in the state and targeted Congress on issues like corruption in land deals, urban-Naxal agenda, reservations, appeasement, dynsaty politics and Article 370.The Congress campaign on the other hand focussed on issues of alleged misgovernance by former chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, who led the BJP government in the state for almost 9 and a half years. BJP removed Khattar ahead of Lok Sabha elections and made Nayab Singh Saini the chief minister. Rahul Gandhi , Mallikarjun Kharge and Priyanka Gandhi addressed several rallies in the state but at the centre of Congress's campaign was senior leader and former state chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda on which the party has placed all its bets. The move led to discontent within the party ranks with senior leader and prominent dalit face Kumari Selja staying away from most part of the campaign. Selja was reportedy unhappy with Hooda having complete say in party affairs, including ticket distribution.Selja has been open about her cold relations with Hooda but has vowed her commitment and loyalty to the party. In an interview with the Lallantop, Selja admitted that after leaving the party presidency, her communication with Hooda had almost stopped.""It's been a long time since I've talked to Bhupinder Singh Hooda. It's not about the bad political relationship, it's like I was in Delhi and he was in Haryana. After that, I was the PCC president, and he was the CLP leader. At that time we used to talk. Before that, from 2014 to 2019, we also used to talk. After quitting the party presidency, we almost stopped talking,"" she said.The grand old party would be wary of one of the predictions made by PM Modi during his campaign when he reminded the Congress about its electoral loss in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, where the campaign was heavily centred around the state heavyweights - Kamal Nath and Ashok Gehlot. Both these leaders had a huge say in taking decisions during the assembly elections in their states. The Congress was routed in Madhya Pradesh and also lost Rajasthan to the BJP.The Congress campaign in Haryana gained strength when wrestlers Vinesh Phogat and Bajrang Punia decided to join party ranks. Besides, several leaders from other parties also made a beeline to join the grand old party ahead of the elections. Interestingly, hours before the campaigning ended, senior BJP leader and former MP Ashok Tanwar joined the Congress at Rahul Gandhi's rally. Ironically, two hours before jumping the ship, Tanwar was campaigning for the BJP candidate in Safidon assembly constituency and exhorting voters to bring it back to power for a third time. Tanwar, a Dalit leader who was considered close to Gandhis had left the Congress in 2019 following differences with Bhupinder Singh Hooda.Riding high on its success in Lok Sabha elections earlier this year, when Congress wrested 5 seats from the BJP to settle for a 5-5 scoreline, the grand old party would hope to form its government in the state after a gap of 10 years.","Campaign for the October 5 assembly elections for the 90-member assembly drawing to a close.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Thursday convicted former MLA and RJD functionary Vijay Kumar Shukla alias Munna Shukla and Mantu Tiwari for the 1998 murder of former Bihar minister Brij Bihari Prasad and awarded them life imprisonment . The court, however, granted benefit of doubt to five other accused including former MP Suraj Bhan Singh, acquitting them of conspiracy charges.The order marked another twist in the sensational case that had rocked Bihar politics in the late 1990s and established the dominance of dreaded gangster Shri Prakash Shukla over the notorious crime syndicates of Bihar and adjoining Uttar Pradesh.A bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna, Sanjay Kumar and R Mahadevan passed the order on an appeal filed by CBI and Prasad's wife, former BJP MP Rama Devi, who had challenged Patna HC order acquitting all the accused in the case.""Mantu Tiwari and Vijay Kumar Shukla alias Munna Shukla are directed to surrender within two weeks to the concerned jail authorities/court to serve the remainder of their respective sentences. In case of failure to surrender, authorities shall take appropriate measures to arrest and detain them in accordance with law,"" the bench said.Brij Bihari Prasad, an influential OBC leader whose rise was seen as part of the challenge that Mandal politics posed to upper caste supremacy in Bihar, was killed on June 13, 1998, at Indira Gandhi's Institute of Medical Sciences in Patna where he was undergoing treatment.His upper caste rivals approached Shri Prakash Shukla, a ruthless killer who had already reached the top of the notoriety graph after carrying out a spate of killings and kidnappings in UP, to eliminate Prasad who was guarded by a well-armed police posse round the clock.Shukla, who knew Prasad's rivals, agreed to carry out the job for the sake of his friends and got himself admitted in the same hospital by feigning illness. Soon after, he gunned down Prasad, the audacity of the crime shocking people and multiplying Shukla's fear. The murder forced UP Police to set up a STF to nab him.The court said HC erred in acquitting all the accused on the basis of minor discrepancies in the statement of witnesses. It also noted HC adversely commented on the versions given by witnesses as to who had reached the hospital at an earlier point in time.""Considering the efflux of time of more than 4-6 years between the date of occurrence and recording of court testimony, these issues are at best superficial and peripheral and would not warrant disregarding the prosecution case. The questions posed to the witnesses were more in the nature of a memory test rather than questions posed to test the truthfulness and credibility of their core testimony,"" the bench said, setting aside HC's order.""Regarding the question of conspiracy and evidence against Suraj Bhan Singh, Mukesh Singh, Lallan Singh, Ram Niranjan Chaudhary and Rajan Tiwari, there is no direct ocular evidence implicating them through the testimonies of Paras Nath Chaudhury and Mahanth Ashwani Das. Since the charge of conspiracy is not substantiated, we will not interfere with HC's judgment, and they are entitled to benefit of doubt,"" the court said.Two other accused - Bhupendra Nath Dubey and Captain Sunil Singh - died during pendency of proceedings.",Vijay Kumar Shukla and Mantu Tiwari convicted of 1998 murder of Brij Bihari Prasad.

2 Meitei hostages 'swapped' for 11 Kukis in Manipur jails,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2-meitei-hostages-swapped-for-11-kukis-in-manipur-jails/articleshow/113919247.cms,"Families of the two hostages at Imphal police station for their handover

GUWAHATI: Two Meitei men held hostage by tribal Kuki village volunteers in Manipur 's Kangpokpi for five days were freed Thursday in a purported exchange involving ""safe passage"" till their native district for 11 undertrial Kuki prisoners , all of whom got bail a couple of months ago but had remained in jail because it was deemed unsafe for them to step out unescorted.Committee on Tribal Unity (CoTU), a Kuki group, handed over Oinam Thoithoi Singh and Thokchom Thoithoiba Singh to a senior police officer in the presence of Assam Rifles and CRPF teams at Kangpokpi's Gamgiphai, 23km from Imphal, around 5am. A third youth reported missing on Sept 27 along with the duo returned home the same day.The tribal organisation released pictures of Kuki and Meitei representatives hugging and shaking hands during the handover, marking the first reciprocal gesture of conciliation from the warring sides in 17 months of ethnic conflict.Around the same time, security forces escorted the 11 Kuki undertrials awaiting safe transportation from Imphal's Sajiwa jail to a church in their native district of Kangpokpi. The prisoners are facing investigation or trial for crimes ranging from murder to drug running.Officials said the release of the two Meitei youths and the bailed undertrials were unconnected, but CoTU termed it an ""exchange"".The organisation's spokesperson, Ng Lun Kipgen, said in a video-recorded statement that the ""amicable solution"" was made possible with the Centre's initiative.The release of the duo was delayed due to some ""conditions set by our village volunteers"", he said. ""The first demand was the transfer of all (Kuki-Zo) jail inmates from Imphal to a Kuki-Zo area like Churachandpur. The second one was the establishment of a police station in the Phailengmong area,"" Kipgen said.""Had the CM (N Biren Singh) cared for those two detained individuals, he would have acted... We requested the Centre to intervene, and finally the DGP, at the behest of the central government, made it possible to reach an amicable solution.""Meitei Heritage Society, one among several influential civil society groups active in the valley, also issued a statement thanking central and state forces, the Manipur govt and others involved in the release of the hostages. But it added, ""We are deeply concerned with the release of the Kuki miscreants/militants as part of the exchange deal to release the hostages because this sets a dangerous precedent,"" it said.","Two Meitei men held hostage by tribal Kuki village volunteers in Manipur's Kangpokpi for five days.

"Haryana polls: Waterlogged crops, roads bring misery in Manu Bhaker’s village",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/haryana-polls-waterlogged-crops-roads-bring-misery-in-manu-bhakers-village/articleshow/113919236.cms,"GORIA : The indoor shooting range on the first floor of Universal Senior Secondary School teems with inspirational quotes, and photographs of its most remarkable student, Manu Bhaker . It was in this shooting range where a teenage Manu — India’s lone sportsperson to win two medals in one Olympics — learnt and sharpened her craft in her early years“This is where it began in 2016.Her early national and international medals were earned from the work she put here,” says her merchant navy man father Ram Kishan Bhaker pointing towards a quote on the beam. “I will win not immediately but definitely,” it says. Nowadays around 70 young shooters aim to hit the bull’s eye in the range. The school, spread over four green acres, is the heartwarming highlight of Goria. But it’s the huge portions of inundated agricultural land across the sprawling village, located on the edge of Jhajjar district, that catches the eye. Bajra (pearl millet) and cotton are the main crops here. “Anaj sadh raha hai (Crops are rotting),” says Dharamvir Singh, a retired army man.Villagers partly blame a nearby power plant for the waterlogging mess. However, it is learnt that excessive rains, overflow from a nearby canal, as well as low-lying land, have combined to create a drainage problem. Whatever the reason, Goria is suffering.Ram Kishan says the submerged farmland has spawned a swarm of mosquitoes and bred water-borne diseases. “Villagers have been asking for a hospital for years. Public transport is almost zero. Just one or two buses come in the morning. Those who have private vehicles are okay. But for others, there’s nothing,” he says. It isn’t just the farmland. In the last week of September, the village main road was flooded.Goria comes under the vastly rural Jhajjar assembly seat, reserved for Scheduled Castes. About 19% of voters are SC. Congress ’ Geeta Bhukkal, 56, an advocate and a former education minister, has been winning the seat since 2009. But Bhukkal’s vote share has fallen sharply from a high 60% (2009) to a more modest 42% (2019). Her foremost challengers are BJP’s Kaptan Birdhana, a 54-year-old businessman, Dushyant Chautala-led JJP’s Naseeb Soni and BSP’s Dharambir Singh. BSP is in alliance with Abhay Singh Chautala’s INLD for the Oct 5 polls.Jats are numerically the largest caste in Goria, which has roughly 3,600 voters. Other castes include Brahmins, OBCs and SCs. Most Jats, says Mahinder Singh, chairman, Universal School, will stamp the ballot for Congress. “We will be voting for Congress for Bhupinder Hooda and Deepender Hooda,” says Mahinder. Manvir Singh, a kumhar (potter) by caste, says that most kumhars in the village have been traditionally Congress voters.In the Harijan chaupal, Dalits complain about absence of drainage and poor drinking water facility. “For us the choice is between Congress and BSP. Most are inclined towards Congress,” says Bhoop Singh, a dalit.Manu’s double bronze medal in Paris 2024 brought hordes of local politicians to Goria. Old felicitation posters still adorn the village walls. For all its misfortunes, the village is still exultant at her success. But the shooter isn’t the only successful sportsperson from the village.There’s Haney Goria, who claimed javelin (F37) gold, setting a record in the Asian Para Games in Hangzhou last year. “His unparalleled skill has ushered in boundless joy and pride for India,” PM Narendra Modi had gushed on X then.But Haney’s father Surendra is unhappy. “My son hasn’t received the cash prize that every Asian Games gold medal winner in Haryana is entitled to,” he says","Manu Bhaker is India’s lone sportsperson to win two medals in one Olympics. Goria is located on the edge of Jhajjar district, on the outskirts of Delhi. Villagers blame a nearby power plant for the waterlogging mess.

""Berozgari ( unemployment ),"" is Singh's single-word response to the dominant theme in the polls where the BJP is struggling to beat anti-incumbency, rebellion and intra-party feuds.Singh is one of the marginal farmers belonging to Kurukshetra, which with Karnal and Kaithal are popular as the ""rice bowl of India"".

A staggering 1.66 lakh applied, including over 40,000 graduates and 6,000 postgraduates. No wonder all parties put govt jobs on top of their manifesto.Sukhvinder Singh, belonging to one of the five Jat families from Indri village on Kurukshetra-Rohtak Road, however, is equally unhappy with the poor quality of roads. ""Go beyond highways ... you will see pathetic roads,"" says Sukhvinder.

He believes BJP will return as govt's ""welfare schemes"" will click for the party again. CM Nayab Singh Saini is BJP's nominee from Ladwa, 15 km from Kurukshetra town, and pitted against incumbent Congress MLA Hawa Singh. Caste dominance boosts Saini's chances, but even for him, it's not a cakewalk.","Kurukshetra is popular as the ""rice bowl of India"" with Karnal and Kaithal.
