PUDUCHERRY: Union Territory of Puducherry will implement a three-language policy, home, school, and collegiate education minister A Namassivayam told the assembly on Thursday, refuting Congress’ allegation that Union govt was trying to impose Hindi through National Education Policy .“There is no imposition of Hindi. Students interested in learning a third language can choose one. It is not compulsory for students to learn Hindi; they can opt for a regional language instead,” Namassivayam said.Rejecting Congress member M Vaithianathan’s allegations, Namassivayam said, “It was Congress govt at the Centre that imposed Hindi in the 1960s, sparking widespread agitation in Tamil Nadu. Talk to your party high command to learn about the anti-Hindi agitation in Tamil Nadu.”In protest, members of DMK and Congress walked out of the House, only to return a few minutes later. Opposition leader R Siva condemned the govt’s decision, saying in a release that the people of Puducherry would teach a fitting lesson to AINRC and BJP for adopting the three-language policy. Schools in Puducherry and Karaikal, previously affiliated with TN state board of education, switched to CBSE in 2023. Schools in Mahe follow Kerala board of education, while those in Yanam follow Andhra board.","Union Territory of Puducherry will implement a three-language policy, home, school, and collegiate education minister A Namassivayam told the assembly on Thursday.

NEW DELHI: BJP on Thursday lashed out at TMC-led West Bengal govt for its decision to “ban” Holi celebrations in Santiniketan, accusing CM Mamata Banerjee of appeasement politics and focusing on securing the Muslim vote bank for electoral gains.“I would like to tell Hindus of West Bengal to celebrate Holi with full enthusiasm. We will fight together against obstacles created by police. No matter how hard people like Banerjee try, they cannot make West Bengal a land of Islam,” state BJP president Sukanta Majumdar said.West Bengal LoP Suvendu Adhikari criticised the state govt for “banning” Holi celebrations at Santiniketan’s Sonajhuri Haat and claimed the “ban” isn’t limited to one area.“The Birbhum additional SP has ordered that Holi celebrations in Santiniketan should end by 10 am due to it being Friday,” he said. “This is happening in Bengal for the first time,” Adhikari said.Visuals from the Sonajhuri Haat area showed banners stating that the region is a protected forest area, where playing Holi, parking cars, videography, and flying drones are prohibited.Bengal forest minister Birbaha Hansda clarified that her department did not enforce any ban but only requested visitors to be cautious while celebrating the festival of colours. The department’s hoardings and banners were only requests to “save the environment,” and that those who wish to play with colours will not be prevented, Hansda said.","West Bengal LoP Suvendu Adhikari criticised the state govt for “banning” Holi celebrations at Santiniketan’s Sonajhuri Haat. “This is happening in Bengal for the first time,” Adhikaari said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118994529,imgsize-208320,width-400,resizemode-4/118994529.jpg"
