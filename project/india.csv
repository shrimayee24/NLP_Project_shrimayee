EVM plea

Firebrand OBC leader Chhagan Bhujbal is hurt over the way he was humiliated by BJP and Shiv Sena brass as well as NCP president Ajit Pawar in the run-up to the LS and the RS polls.Although Bhujbal has no plans to quit NCP, he feels he was more respected in undivided NCP led by his political mentor, Sharad Pawar. From once being a member of the core committee that decided the nominees for assembly and LS elections, he was ultimately denied a nomination after a long wait.When the discussion for the Nashik LS seat began, although Shiv Sena's Hemant Godse was Eknath Shinde's first choice, the BJP leadership felt that Bhujbal had elective merit. At a meeting at the residence of Ajit Pawar, Bhujbal was told he would be NCP's Nashik LS pick and that his name would be declared at any moment.Bhujbal began massive preparations in the region. He waited and waited, and ultimately on the last day of filing of nominations, Shinde declared Godse's candidature, which surprised all since he had not been in the zone of consideration. Shiv Sena (UBT)'s Rajabhau Waje defeated Godse.Then, Bhujbal was given the hope that he would be nominated to the Rajya Sabha from the seat vacated by Praful Patel. Bhujbal knew it was a false promise, yet he held on to the hope of showing his presence in the national capital. At the last moment, Ajit Pawar's wife, Sunetra Pawar, was nominated to the Rajya Sabha. Bhujbal lodged a silent protest, but it was a futile exercise.Senior BJP functionaries are surprised by Sujay Vikhe Patil applying for verification of EVMs at 40 police stations. Defying expectations, Sujay, the son of revenue minister Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, lost theLS polls from Ahmednagar to NCP (SP)'s Nilesh Lanke by 28,929 votes.Eight other candidates who lost the polls, including three from BJP, have sought EVM check and verification.Sujay has demanded checking of EVMs of Karjat-Jamkhed assembly seat represented by NCP (SP)'s Rohit Pawar, Parner represented by Lanke, Shrigonda by BJP's Babanrao Pachpute, Rahuri by NCP's Prasad Tanpure, and Shevgaon by BJP's Monika Rajale. Apparently, at a meeting convened by the local BJP unit, Sujay was told he received negligible votes in 40 booths and he then decided to approach the district election officer.BJP functionaries feel that Sujay's decision has given ammo to the opposition, which had already been insisting on restoration of the ballot paper system. A senior party functionary says it's being doubted if he even consulted the BJP brass before taking the call.","OBC leader Chhagan Bhujbal is hurt over the way he was humiliated by BJP and Shiv Sena brass.

PM Modi sets stage for stormy session with 'Emergency' attack; opposition responds with 'save Constitution' march,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/reading-the-numbers-in-the-house-oppn-revels-in-stronger-presence-modi-led-nda-vie-to-stave-off-challenge/articleshow/111237054.cms,"Rahul Vs Modi Encounter; Cong MP's Action During PM's Oath Goes Viral | Watch

NEW DELHI: The 18th Lok Sabha started on a stormy note with both the BJP-led NDA and the Congress-led opposition making their intent clear on Day 1 of the session. With the BJP short of majority and the Congress nearly doubled in strength, the number dynamics of the Lower House has changed and Monday offered a glimpse of the fireworks that could follow in the days ahead.Prime Minister Modi set the stage for the government's offensive making a special mention of the ""dark days of Emergency"" in his speech ahead of the session. The Prime Minister said the new generation will never forget the day when the Constitution of India was completely rejected by suppressing democracy and the country was turned into a prison. He exhorted people to take a resolve to protect democracy and democratic traditions of India so that such an event never arises again.The Congress-led opposition, on the other hand, kept the campaign momentum going as it took out ""Save Constitution"" march to Lok Sabha and later waived copies of the Constitution, both outside and inside the House.In his customary pre-session remarks, Modi targeted his political rivals as he said people want debate and diligence, and not drama and disturbance, in Parliament. The Prime Minister also reached out to the opposition and stressed on consensus as the need of hour to run the country. “To run a government, we need a majority but to run a country we need consensus,” he said. Substance is important, not slogans , the PM added.However, with his Emergency attack to isolate the Congress within the opposition ranks, PM Modi made it clear that the government was ready to take the fight to the opposition camp.PM Modi's attack evoked a strong reaction from the Congress with party chief Mallikarjun Kharge accusing him of imposing ""undeclared Emergency"" in the last 10 years, which the people of the country have ended by not giving the BJP a majority.Kharge said the Prime Minister made a longer than usual customary address ""but clearly, even after the moral and political defeat, the arrogance remains"".""Narendra Modi ji, you are giving advice to the Opposition. You are reminding us of the 50-year-old Emergency, but have forgotten the last 10 years of Undeclared Emergency, which was ended by the people,"" the Congress president said in a post on 'X'.""People have given their mandate against Modi ji. Despite this, if he has become the Prime Minister, then he should work,"" Kharge said, adding that the nation was hoping that he would say something on important issues.Taking a swipe at Prime Minister's words that ""people need substance, not slogans"", Kharge said the Prime Minister should remind himself of this.Inside Lok Sabha, it was Rahul Gandhi, who led the charge against the Prime Minister as the Congress leader showed a copy of the Constitution when PM Modi took his oath. Rahul demanded that the government address ten fiascos in 15 days that have erupted since the Modi-led NDA government returned to power.For the first time since he became the Prime Minister in 2014, PM Modi faces an opposition that will not just be vociferous in its attacks but will also have strong numbers in the House. The Prime Minister and his government will face their first challenge on Wednesday, when the House elects a Speaker.The opposition has made it clear that if the government does not take steps for consensus, it will contest both the Speaker and deputy Speaker's post. Revolutionary Socialist Party's Lok Sabha MP NK Premachandran has dropped hints that INDIA bloc will field candidates for the election of these posts.""Definitely, we will contest the Speaker post as well as the Deputy Speaker post. Let the government come out with their opinion on whether they are going to discuss with the opposition parties so as to have a consensus on the Speaker and Deputy Speaker, and then we will think of it. Otherwise, we will definitely contest,"" Premchandran told ANI.With the session commencing under the shadow of medical exam NEET controversy, cancellation of UGC-NET exam, terror attacks in Kashmir, West Bengal train accident, and the Tamil Nadu hooch tragedy, a rejuvenated opposition is all geared up to corner the government. The opposition will also focus on unemployment, price rise and economic disparities to put pressure on the government.Ever since the results were out on June 4, the BJP has tried to push the message that it is business as usual arguing that a third term is vindication by the people for the ruling dispensation. However, the opposition is not buying this argument and leaves no opportunity to remind the BJP that it no more has a majority and is dependent on allies for the survival of NDA government.The opposition criticized the appointment of Mahtab, a seven-term member, as pro-tem Speaker over Kodikunnil Suresh, a Congress member with eight terms. The Congress-led opposition claimed that this decision breached the tradition that the senior-most MP should be chosen for the role.Congress leader Jairam Ramesh accused the BJP of bias against Dalits, questioning why Karnataka MP Ramesh Chandappa Jigajinagi, also a seven-term parliamentarian, was overlooked for the pro-tem Speaker position.","The 18th Lok Sabha started on a stormy note with both the BJP-led NDA and the Congress-led opposition making their intent clear on Day 1 of the session.

NEW DELHI: The divide between the treasury and the opposition benches in the 18th Lok Sabha went beyond seat-arrangements to appear like battlelines drawn on the first day of the new House.INDIA bloc kicked off the day with a protest in the Parliament complex. Mallikarjun Kharge, Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi , K C Venugopal, and Trinamool MPs like Mahua Moitra, DMK's Kanimozhi and T R Baalu, N K Premachandran, Rajkumar Roat and others, held up red-covered copies of the Constitution and led rounds of lusty sloganeering.Rahul said, ""We will protect the Constitution from attacks by PM Narendra Modi and Amit Shah. Our message is going deep."" As part of a plan, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav with this troupe of 37 MPs walked into Parliament, all with a copy of the Constitution. It was in Hindi, with white covers.Modi entered the house at 10.57am, to the now familiar chants of ""Modi, Modi"" and loud applause. And when at 11.07am, he took the podium to say ""main Narendra Damodardas Modi"" for oath, Rahul Gandhi, K Suresh, K C Venugopal, Gaurav Gogoi, Deepender Hooda, Supriya Sule, Dimple Yadav raised copies of the Constitution - the same was done to Amit Shah. It appeared bitter, a spillover of the no-holds-barred campaign that ended days ago. Suresh, ignored for pro tem Speaker, would be recorded in history as the first protester in the 18th House, rising within minutes of convening to ask that his name be dropped from the panel to assist pro tem Speaker Bhartruhari Mahtab. His shouts were ignored, which led to even louder shouts.The Prime Minister, on his part, did not make any pretence of bonhomie. He took the oath, and took his seat. Given a go by was decades-old custom of a round of the opposition benches with folded hands and pleasantries. Rajnath Singh and Amit Shah, took his cue. Gaurav Gogoi and Kalyan Banerjee pointed out ""the old conventions are being broken"". But there were no takers for feel-good. Gogoi, when his turn came, took oath from the podium on the treasury side, and even shook a few hands.The seating appeared to betray the tension. Bang opposite PM Modi, across the aisle, was his implacable critic Rahul Gandhi. There has been no announcement yet on the leader of opposition, but Rahul led the show in the absence of Sonia Gandhi, who has moved over to the House of the Elders. Not clear from afar was if they glanced at each other.One of the heroes of the Battle 2024, Akhilesh Yadav appeared to rub it in. He sat sporting his trademark red cap with an easy smile plastered on his face, but gave primacy to Awadhesh Prasad, the veteran and Dalit who arguably gave BJP the sorest wound by winning the Ayodhya (Faizabad) constituency. The red caps appeared like red rags to the ruling camp.It continued in that tone. Education minister Dharmendra Pradhan was taunted with cries of ""NEET, NEET"", Girijraj Singh was told by Trinamool Congress's Kalyan Banerjee that ""your comments increased Trinamool's tally"". Rahul let out guffaws as the voluble Banerjee told Prahlad Joshi ""we will miss you as parliamentary affairs minister"". The day was for left-handed barbs.Not long ago, Day 1 used to be a solemn occasion of bipartisanship, littered with light moments and comments, fist bumping and reminiscing. This time, there were few handshakes.

NEW DELHI: The routine custom of newly-elected Lok Sabha members being administered oath by the pro tem Speaker was marred on Monday with opposition members nominated by the President to the panel of chairpersons refusing to take oath when their scheduled turn arrived in order to avoid presiding over the session in the absence of pro tem Speaker Bhartruhari Mahtab.PM Modi was the first to take oath followed by members of the panel of chairpersons, which included Radha Mohan Singh and Faggan Singh Kulaste of BJP, after which the council of ministers took oath before other MPs in alphabetical order.However, the three opposition MPs in the panel of chairpersons - K Suresh (Congress), Sudip Bandyopadhyay (Trinamool Congress) and T R Balu (DMK) - gave a miss to the oath-taking. They were listed just after PM Modi and ahead of the council of ministers.With substantial increase in their numbers, most opposition MPs, particularly from Congress and Samajwadi Party, carried copies of the Constitution to the House. While Modi was taking oath, opposition members rose to their feet, holding copies of the Constitution. They did the same when Union home minister Amit Shah took oath, but remained seated this time.Congress MP from Mavelikara K Suresh was the first to raise objection when proceedings started as he asked the chair to drop his name from panel of chairpersons.When Modi reached Parliament Monday, he was accompanied by Union ministers from four different regions of the country - Jitendra Singh, L Murugan, Arjun Ram Meghwal and Kiren Rijiju, to which a senior BJP leader said, ""It is true spirit of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.""Meanwhile, Independent MP from Baramulla in Kashmir Abdul Rashid Sheikh could not take oath Monday despite his name being called as he has been lodged in jail since 2019 after being charged by the NIA in a terror-funding case.

""It is my turn to speak today and yours to listen,"" she told the audience of civic body chiefs, ministers, MLAs and senior officials.As many in her range of firing visibly squirmed, Mamata named fire services minister and Bidhannagar MLA Sujit Bose, accusing him of encouraging encroachments in Kolkata's Rajarhat and in front of Salt Lake Sector V's Webel Bhavan. She also accused state food processing minister and Howrah (Central) MLA Arup Roy and Howrah (North) MLA Goutam Chowdhury of extortion. TOI tried to contact both for comment, but they didn't respond. The CM charged Bally Municipality administrator Amrita Roy Burman with dereliction of duty.""Have you seen Hatibagan's state? I made the city so beautiful. But now, a new OC (of a police station) comes and immediately brings in new illegal settlers. The situation is similar in Gariahat, where hawkers have brought back plastic sheds.

You are going around in big cars, dining at fancy restaurants. Everything is fine, but first think of the people. I see many of you going around in cars with beacons. Even I don't (do that)."" Her 70-minute tirade at Nabanna, the state secretariat, came 20 days after the Lok Sabha verdict, which saw Trinamool trumping BJ-12 in Bengal, albeit with some unexpected setbacks in the urban belt.To Trinamool functionaries, she said that those indulging in extortion or doing shoddy work would be thrown out of the party. She said tickets for future elections would be given out based solely on performance. ""I don't want 'master' extortionists. I want people's servants,"" she said, as the municipal corporations of Howrah, Bidhannagar, and Siliguri copped the bulk of her criticism. Mamata listed improper waste management, water supply, electricity wastage, parking rackets and extortion among the ills afflicting the state.She announced a key change in the govt tender process. Civic bodies are no longer authorised to give out contracts. Instead, a committee comprising the chief secretary and secretaries of home, finance, land and irrigation departments, police commissioners and an officer of the rank of additional director-general of police will oversee the process.She also issued show-cause notices to the sub-divisional officers in charge of civic bodies in Howrah, Haldia and Cooper's Camp (Nadia).""Why should the govt's image be tarnished because of the misdeeds of a few?

NEW DELHI: The INDIA bloc of opposition parties made their intent clear on the very first day of the 18th Lok Sabha on Monday by marching from the old Parliament building gate towards the new Parliament House holding copies of the Constitution and chanting slogans of ""save democracy "" and ""long live Constitution"".Opposition leaders, including Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, party MP Rahul Gandhi, Trinamool Congress's Sudip Bandyopadhyay and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam's T R Baalu, among others, assembled at the spot where the Gandhi statue once stood in the Parliament complex.Former Congress chief and Rajya Sabha MP Sonia Gandhi, too, joined the MPs.Rahul said they (opposition) would not allow the Constitution to be ""attacked"" by PM Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah. ""This attack is not acceptable to us and that is why we held the Constitution and took oath,"" he said. ""Our message is reaching the public and no power can touch the Constitution and we will protect it,"" he added.The Gandhi statue, which was the favourite protest site for opposition MPs, was recently relocated along with 14 other statues that dotted the complex, to a new spot in the Parliament complex named Prerna Sthal.Several opposition parties said the mandate of the Lok Sabha elections was against the BJP, even though it was able to form government with support of other parties.

Emergency reminds us to protect Constitution: PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/emergency-reminds-us-to-protect-constitution-pm-modi/articleshow/111239981.cms,"PM Modi vows NDA will deliver 3 times more in its 3rd term

NEW DELHI: PM Modi marked the beginning of the maiden session of the new Lok Sabha by lobbing the ""Constitution"" issue back at the INDIA bloc, asking everybody to ensure that there was no subversion of the Constitution as during the Emergency .A day before the 49th anniversary of the Indira Gandhi govt's decision to curb dissent by imposing Emergency, Modi urged people to ensure such an attempt to ""blacken"" the Constitution is never repeated and pledged to safeguard it.His remarks came as the opposition , flush with the success of its allegation that Modi-led BJP had sought 400+ seats to change the Constitution, carried on with the theme. Members of Congress, TMC, DMK, Left and others held a protest after paying respects at Mahatma Gandhi's statue in Parliament complex, holding copies of the Constitution and ""promising to protect it"".Opposition MPs flashed copies of Constitution in what appeared to be a celebration of the success in paring down BJP’s numbers.“Tomorrow is the 25th of June. For those dedicated to the dignity of the Constitution and who believe in Bharat’s democratic traditions, the 25th of June is an unforgettable day. Tomorrow marks 50 years since a dark chapter was written into India’s democracy. The new generation of Bharat must never forget how the Constitution was completely disregarded, torn apart, and the country was turned into a prison, with democracy utterly suppressed,” the PM said in his address to media ahead of the session’s commencement.Modi, who had rebutted the charge that BJP intended to change the Constitution during the campaign and had argued that, to the contrary, it was the opposition which had violated the decision of the founding fathers by implementing quotas for Muslims on grounds of religion, sent out an equally loud signal that for him, the battle over the Constitution was not over yet. Taking up suspension of democracy and civil rights during the Emergency, he said, “These 50 years since the Emergency remind us to protect our Constitution and democracy with pride. The countrymen must resolve that such a travesty will never be allowed to happen again. We commit ourselves to ensuring a vibrant democracy and fulfilling the common man’s dreams as outlined by the Indian Constitution.”The remarks appeared to be a prelude to a BJP campaign to recall the days of the Emergency when most of its stalwarts were put in prison.Modi sought to play down his lower-than-expected numbers by highlighting his success in getting a record third term. Terming NDA’s third victory as remarkable and significant, he said the third consecutive mandate also meant a three-fold jump in his responsibilities, as he sought to assure that he would work three times harder. “We will achieve three times the results, moving forward with this new mission,” he said, adding, “This House of ours will become a House of resolutions. Our 18th Lok Sabha should be filled with resolutions that bring the dreams of the common man to fruition.”He emphasised the importance of consensus in governance, but not without mentioning the role of a “responsible opposition”. Recalling disruptions during Parliament proceedings in the past, he said people expect debate and diligence, not tantrums, drama and disturbance. “They seek substance, not slogans. The country needs a good and responsible opposition,” he said, adding that he would try to take everybody along.","PM Modi marks the beginning of the maiden session of the new Lok Sabha by lobbing the ""Constitution"" issue back at the INDIA bloc.
