BJP’s Succession Script Repeats: Why Nitin Nabin Is Working President, And Not Nadda's Replacement

NEW DELHI: Announcing the schedule for the election of its national president, BJP said on Friday that nomination will be filed on Jan 19 and the replacement for incumbent J P Nadda will be declared the next day. If more than one person file nomination, an unlikely prospect as the election of working president Nitin Nabin is seen as a certainty, then the polling will be held on Jan 20. BJP also published the list of the electoral college, which includes 5,717 voters starting from PM Narendra Modi down to local members, for choosing the new president.The party's brass - Modi, his cabinet colleagues such as Amit Shah and Rajnath Singh besides chief ministers - are expected to submit different sets of nomination papers proposing the name of Nabin, who at 45 will be its youngest ever president.He will replace Nadda, who was elected to the position exactly six years ago on Jan 20, 2020.","Nomination will be filed on Jan 19 and replacement for incumbent J P Nadda will be declared the next day.

MUMBAI: As Maharashtra heads to elections on Thursday for 29 municipal corporations, all eyes are on Mumbai, where the BJP-led Mahayuti is locked in a battle with the united Thackeray front for control of the cash-rich Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).Polling for the 2,869 seats spread across 893 wards will begin at 7.30 am and conclude at 5.30 pm on January 15. A total of 3.48 crore voters are eligible to decide the fate of 15,931 candidates, including 1,700 in Mumbai and 1,166 in Pune. Counting of votes will take place on January 16.More than 25,000 police personnel, including senior officers, will be deployed across Mumbai to oversee elections to the BMC and vote counting. Except for Mumbai, the other 28 urban bodies have multi-member wards.This will be the Shiv Sena’s first BMC election since the 2022 split, when Eknath Shinde broke away with a majority of the party’s legislators, along with its name and symbol. The undivided Shiv Sena had held sway over the country’s richest civic body for 25 years.In a political turn ahead of the elections, estranged cousins Uddhav and Raj Thackeray reunited after two decades in their bid to consolidate Marathi votes, even as rival NCP factions forged a local alliance in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad.In this election, the Opposition Congress has asserted its presence in Mumbai by stepping out of the shadow of its Maha Vikas Aghadi allies — Shiv Sena (UBT) and Sharad Pawar's NCP (SP). The Congress has joined hands with Prakash Ambedkar’s Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) and the Rashtriya Samaj Paksh in the state capital, even as it contests independently in Nagpur.Elections to 29 municipal corporations are being held after a gap of over six years, with their terms having ended between 2020 and 2023. Of these, nine fall within the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), the most urbanised belt in India.The battlegrounds include Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, Navi Mumbai, Vasai-Virar, Kalyan-Dombivli, Kolhapur, Nagpur, Mumbai, Solapur, Amravati, Akola, Nashik, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Pune, Ulhasnagar, Thane, Chandrapur, Parbhani, Mira-Bhayandar, Nanded-Waghala, Panvel, Bhiwandi-Nizampur, Latur, Malegaon, Sangli-Miraj-Kupwad, Jalgaon, Ahilyanagar, Dhule, Jalna, and Ichalkaranji.Chief Minister Fadnavis, along with his deputies Eknath Shinde and Ajit Pawar, campaigned extensively across Maharashtra, while cousins Uddhav and Raj Thackeray concentrated their efforts on Mumbai, Thane, Nashik, and Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, where Uddhav held a rally. Telangana minister Mohammad Azharuddin, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi, and Tamil Nadu BJP leader K Annamalai were also among the star campaigners for the polls.Populist promises for women were the highlight of the manifestos of both the Mahayuti and the Shiv Sena (UBT)-MNS. The Mahayuti has promised a 50 per cent concession for women in BEST bus travel, while the Thackeray cousins have assured a Rs 1,500 monthly allowance for women domestic helps and a property tax waiver on houses up to 700 sq ft. The Congress manifesto, by contrast, prioritises combating Mumbai’s pollution, upgrading the BEST fleet, and strengthening the city’s financial health.The race for Mumbai’s mayoral post took centre stage in the campaign, with the BJP claiming that a Sena (UBT) victory could lead to a Muslim mayor, a charge the Uddhav Thackeray-led party countered by assuring voters of a Marathi mayor. CM Fadnavis also guaranteed that the mayor will be a ""Hindu and Marathi.""In the 227-ward Mumbai, the BJP is contesting 137 seats, the Shiv Sena 90, while the NCP is fighting separately on 94 seats. The Shiv Sena (UBT) has fielded 163 candidates, the MNS 52, the Congress 143 and the VBA 46. The Congress has fielded 1,263 candidates across the rest of the state.The Maharashtra State Election Commission on Friday announced that Thursday, January 15, will be a public holiday in areas falling under the 29 municipal corporations where polling will be held, an official said.The holiday will apply to government and semi-government offices, corporations, boards, public undertakings, banks, and central government offices within the jurisdiction of the civic bodies.The poll comission said administrative preparations, including readiness of EVMs, have been completed and urged the public to take an active part in the democratic exercise.","Elections to 29 municipal corporations are being held after a gap of over six years.

Uncle-nephew alliance

NCP merger in limbo?

NEW DELHI: The coming together of Ajit Pawar and Sharad Pawar faltered on Friday as united Nationalist Congress Party suffered a massive setback in Pimpri-Chinchwad and Pune municipal elections.According to the latest trends, BJP has taken the lead of 74 wards in the Pimpri-Chinchwad municipal corporations -- considered as one of the richest after the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation. Meanwhile, NCP(Ajit Pawar) is ahead of 40 seats, while the NCP(Sharad Pawar) is leading in one ward.This comes despite NCP's aggressive campaigning in the city during the run up to the elections.Meanwhile, BJP is leading in 52 wards in Pune. NCP, on the other hand, is leading in only two wards. The Congress which is ahead in five wards, is allying with the Thackeray brothers (Uddhav's Shiv Sena and Raj's MNS) - who are not leading in any wards.Both factions of NCP came together for the local body polls in Maharashtra. This came two years after, Ajit along with a group of senior leaders, parted ways with his uncle Sharad Pawar and joined hands with BJP and Eknath Shinde's Shiv Sena in Maharashtra.Ajit was sworn in as deputy chief minister under this new alliance. He favoured aligning with the ruling coalition, while Sharad Pawar's faction insisted on remaining with the opposition.The Election Commission later recognised Ajit's faction as the legitimate NCP, retaining the ‘clock' symbol. Meanwhile, Sharad Pawar's faction (NCP-SP) adopted the ‘tutari' (curved trumpet) symbol.Both factions contested elections separately. After the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, where his faction faced setbacks, Ajit Pawar acknowledged that turning his back on family had been a “mistake”.During the elections campaign, speculations were rife that both the factions of NCP were heading towards a merger. Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and Supriya Sule hinted at a reunion in the future.While speaking to news agency IANS, Sule had said that a decision about the merger could be taken in the future.“Our alliance is formed for the Pune Municipal Corporation elections. We will see about it in the future,” Sule said.However, after the lackluster performance in the local body polls, it would be interesting to see if both the factions would still see merit in coming together.","NCP suffered a massive setback in Pimpri-Chinchwad and Pune municipal elections.

Mumbai And Pune Verdict Shake Thackeray And Pawar Dynasties As Legacy Politics Faces Reality Check







MUMBAI: The Mahayuti alliance, led by the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) and Eknath Shinde ’s Shiv Sena , is storming ahead in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections, according to trends.With leads in over 110 wards across the city, the alliance appears on course to end the three-decade reign of the Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena.Meanwhile, the Shiv Sena (UBT) alliance struggles to cross 68, with MNS leading in just 9 seats, UBT Sena in 58, and the NCP (SP) barely holding one. Congress , too, faces a grim outlook, with leads in only 10 wards.High-profile battles are drawing attention. UBT’s Foram Parmar trails in Ward 1, while Gita Bhandari of the same faction is ahead in Ward 32.Shinde Sena’s Varsha Tembelkar is leading in Ward 51, and BJP candidates Deepak Tavde, Ujjwal Veti, and Neil Somaiya are showing strong leads.In Dharavi, Congress’ Asha Deepak Kale clinched Ward 183, offering a rare bright spot for the party.The political earthquake is not limited to Mumbai.In the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), BJP has displaced the Pawars, leading in 50 of 165 seats, while the two NCP factions trail with just 5 leads and the Congress-UBT alliance in 7.Official figures confirm BJP’s dominance with 47 leads, compared to 8 for NCP and 5 for Congress.Most exit polls had predicted a BJP-Shinde Sena wave, and preliminary trends suggest that the prediction is unfolding.If sustained, this result would mark the end of the 30-year incumbency of the Uddhav Thackeray-led outfit in India’s richest civic body.In majority of rallies, MNS chief Raj Thackeray called for Marathi unity, warning that the state’s language, land, and identity are under threat.He described the BMC elections as “decisive” for the Marathi community and urged voters to unite and remain vigilant to prevent malpractice.","The Mahayuti alliance, led by the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) and Eknath Shinde ’s Shiv Sena, is storming ahead in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections.

PUNE:The civic polls delivered a string of surprises, tight finishes and political ironies, underlining the volatility of local politics in the city.In one of the closest contests, Congress candidate Avinash Bagwe was edged out by a wafer-thin margin of just 64 votes in ward number 22 in Kashewadi Dias Plot, highlighting how fiercely fought several seats were.The results also proved sobering for party organisations. Shubhash Jagtap, one of the two city unit chiefs of the Ajit Pawar-led NCP, failed to secure a victory, as did fivetime corporator Aba Bagul, whose switch from Congress to Shiv Sena did not translate into electoral success.The elections, however, also threw up striking contrasts. Laxmi Andekar and Sonali Andekar emerged victorious despite being in jail over their alleged involvement in a murder case.In another unusual outcome, brothers Raghvendra Mankar of the BJP and Harshvardhan Mankar of the NCP won from two different wards, representing rival parties.Seasoned leaders were not immune to defeat. Three-time corporator Moreshwar Bhondwe lost from Ravet-Kiwale. At the same time, political turnarounds marked the polls, with Prashant Jagtap pulling off a win on a Congress ticket. Jagtap, who while serving as the city unit chief rebelled against NCP (SP), briefly aligned with Ajit Pawarled NCP before the elections.","In one of the closest contests, Congress candidate Avinash Bagwe was edged out by a wafer-thin margin of just 64 votes in ward number 22 in Kashewadi Dias Plot.
