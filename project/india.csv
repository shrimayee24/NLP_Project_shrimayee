BJP Targets Mamata Banerjee Over ED Raid At I-PAC, Alleges Evidence Tampering

BHAGALPUR: Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) MP Nishikant Dubey on Saturday reacted to the Enforcement Directorate (ED) raid at the Indian Political Action Committee (I-PAC) office and matters involving West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee , stating that the Trinamool Congress ( TMC ) leader is not troubled by the ED but by a purported ""CD"" that could potentially end her political career.Speaking to ANI, Dubey said, ""They (Mamata Banerjee) are not troubled by ED but by their CD, their CD is very dangerous, perhaps it could end their entire political career, so they are not troubled by ED but by CD...""The remark comes after West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee allegedly interfered during an ED raid in Kolkata at the offices of political consultancy firm I-PAC in connection with the coal smuggling case.Earlier, Banerjee questioned the legality of the raid, alleging that the central agency had seized party-related materials, including hard disks, candidate lists and strategic documents, and accused Amit Shah of misusing central agencies.""Is it the duty of the ED, Amit Shah, to collect the party's hard disk, candidate list? The nasty, naughty Home Minister who cannot protect the country is taking away all my party documents,"" Banerjee said while speaking to reporters.""At 6:00 am, they arrived and seized the party's data, laptops, strategies, and mobile phones. Their forensic experts transferred all the data. I believe this is a crime,"" she said.Countering the Chief Minister's allegations, the ED accused Mamata Banerjee of entering the residential premises of Prateek Jain, director of I-PAC, during the ongoing search operation and taking away ""key evidence"", including physical documents and electronic devices.""Banerjee entered the residential premises of Prateek Jain and took away key evidence, including physical documents and electronic devices,"" the ED said, adding that her convoy then proceeded to I-PAC's office, from where ""Ms Banerjee, her aides and the state police personnel forcibly removed physical documents and electronic evidence"".On Friday, TMC MPs in Delhi staged a protest at the Home Ministry in Delhi, raising slogans against Amit Shah, alleging ""misuse"" of the probe agency. Delhi Police later detained the TMC MPs and took them to Parliament Street police station.","Mamata Banerjee allegedly interfered during an ED raid in Kolkata at the offices of political consultancy firm I-PAC in connection with the coal smuggling case.

Mamata Banerjee Hits Streets, Leads Kolkata Rally Against ED Raids

Multiple FIRs filed 'in malicious manner' against officers: ED

NEW DELHI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has decided to move Supreme Court seeking remedy against the ""unfortunate action of West Bengal chief minister"" in obstructing the probe and tampering with evidence in a PMLA case against I-PAC, and a nod to continue with its probe against the political consultancy agency. The petition is likely to be filed late in the night or early Sunday morning.Lawyers aware of the developments told TOI that ED has, in its petition, accused the West Bengal police of actively acting under the directions of the TMC govt to thwart the probe into the money laundering case against I-PAC, by an FIR against the directorate officials to coerce them not to conduct investigations in the case.ED is trying to get the petition listed for Monday amid indications that the solicitor general may represent it if the Supreme Court entertains the plea.The West Bengal govt has already filed a caveat in SC to preempt ED from seeking and getting an ex parte order, amid its continuing political slugfest with central agencies which began with the state govt in Nov 2018, withdrawing general consent to CBI to investigate cases inside the state.ED, it is learnt, has argued that its attempt to raise its grievances before Calcutta HC was unsuccessful as unruly scenes during the hearing on Friday forced the judge to adjourn hearing on a case which required urgent interim orders to protect the sanctity of investigations.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) is also contemplating requesting Supreme Court to transfer the pending petitions, one by ED and the other by Trinamool Congress relating to I-PAC case, to Delhi high court to be in an atmosphere conducive to adjudication by a constitutional court.The agency had petitioned Calcutta high court on Friday to order a CBI probe against West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee , DGP Rajeev Kumar, Kolkata Police commissioner Manoj Varma and others for ""theft of digital and other evidence, wrongful restraint and confinement of central govt officers, and breakdown of the rule of law"".It said that multiple FIRs had been registered ""in a malicious manner"" against its officers for conducting an investigation under Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) into the financial dealings of political consultancy I-PAC, which has been associated with TMC and the Bengal govt for years.The 28-page petition, filed in response to Mamata and the police brass's allegedly ""illegal and unconstitutional interference"" in ED's search of addresses linked to I-PAC, details how the Bengal CM and her entourage tailed the central agency throughout Thursday - from the Loudon Street residence of the firm's director Pratik Jain to its office in the tech hub of Salt Lake's Sector V.The petition alleges that Mamata entered Jain's residence around 12.05pm and ""took possession of all digital devices along with key incriminating documents"" from an ED officer, ignoring requests not to interfere with the investigation into I-PAC's alleged role in money laundering linked to a 2020 coal scam.At I-PAC's Salt Lake office, ED officers were ""obstructed"" while performing their duties as the CM and a contingent of Trinamool functionaries and workers refused to budge from there for nearly four hours, the petition stated.Countering the CM's allegation that Union home minister Amit Shah had sent ED to ""snatch"" documents and digital storage containing Trinamool Congress's poll plans under the garb of an investigation into I-PAC's dealings, ED informed the high court that its officials officially recorded the sequence of events in a panchnama.","The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has decided to move Supreme Court seeking remedy against the ""unfortunate action of West Bengal chief minister"" The petition is likely to be filed late in the night or early Sunday morning.

BJP Targets Mamata Banerjee Over ED Raid At I-PAC, Alleges Evidence Tampering

KOLKATA: Coinciding with its fight against ED over searches on I-PAC, Trinamool Congress released on Saturday a three-minute campaign song and music video titled 'Jotoi koro hamla, abar jitbe Bangla' (Attack as much you can, Bengal will win) to galvanise workers ahead of the Bengal elections this summer.The song has echoes of TMC's 2021 campaign theme, ""Bangla nijer meye-kei chaye"" (Bengal wants its own daughter), in a reference to chief minister Mamata Banerjee . This time, weaving ""Bengali asmita"" (pride) into its campaign narrative, the video outlines TMCs core campaign planks in the run-up to the polls.The video highlights attacks on religion and Bengali language, stressing that the political battle is also about ""saving Bengal's plurality"" both in religion and personal choices. Protests against attacks on Bengali-speaking migrants also feature in the clip.According to a TMC senior, two images spell out the narrative for party workers. One is Mamata's fighter perception, reinforced by a split-second image in which she transforms into a Royal Bengal tigress. The second is the positioning of black-and-a-white images of PM Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah - to mark out the key adversaries.The campaign this time is a repositioning of TMC's 2024 Lok Sabha election theme, ""Jonogoner Gorjon, Banglay BJP er Bisorjon"" (Roar of the people, BJP's ouster from Bengal), TMC's senior functionaries said.TMC had first used this theme ahead of the 2021 assembly elections, a contest that came with a series of firsts for Mamata.""This was the first time she contested from a seat outside Kolkata. It was the first time she had to deal with poll-eve defections on a large scale, including two senior ministers led by Suvendu Adhikari,"" a TMC senior said.Listing the other milestones, the senior pointed out that it was the first time that Mamata led an entire 50-day election campaign, ""not on her feet but on a wheelchair"" after she was injured in a pre-poll car mishap. ""It was the first time she had allowed a poll strategist to recalibrate her political strategy,"" the senior said, alluding to I-PAC founder Prashant Kishor.","The song has echoes of TMC's 2021 campaign theme, ""Bangla nijer meye-kei chaye"" (Bengal wants its own daughter) This time, weaving ""Bengali asmita"" (pride) into its campaign narrative, the video outlines TMCs core campaign planks.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126460307,imgsize-1384303,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-24.jpg"
Devendra Fadnavis arrest ‘plot’: Maharashtra top cop pushed for case against ex-DGP Sanjay Pandey,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/devendra-fadnavis-arrest-plot-maharashtra-top-cop-pushed-for-case-against-ex-dgp-report-submitted-before-retirement/articleshow/126460999.cms,"





MUMBAI: Just four days before her retirement on Jan 3, former DGP Rashmi Shukla submitted a report to the state home department saying an offence should be registered against ex-DGP and former Mumbai police commissioner Sanjay Pandey, along with two other police officers, for conspiring to arrest Devendra Fadnavis, who was opposition leader, and Eknath Shinde, who was UD minister, during the tenure of the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) govt.An SIT was formed to probe the issue raised in the assembly by MLC Pravin Darekar, and it submitted its report to the govt. Shukla was asked to submit her opinion on the report. Pandey declined to comment.The SIT had investigated the allegation of a criminal conspiracy to implicate Fadnavis and Shinde in an urban land ceiling (ULC) certificates scam case. The scam pertained to builders who allegedly submitted bogus ULC certificates and were exempted from surrendering 5% excess land to govt. During the MVA govt’s tenure, Thane police investigated businessman Sanjay Punamia, who was in a dispute with his business partner Shaymsundar Agarwal, in the scam. Afterwards, Punamia had alleged he was pressured to give a statement against Fadnavis and Shinde in the ULC scam.Shukla suggested the govt register an FIR against Pandey and police officers Laxmikant Patil and Sardar Patil for criminal conspiracy, a public servant disobeying the law, fabricating false evidence, and threatening a person to give a false statement, for conspiring to implicate Fadnavis and Shinde in an old case registered in Thane in 2016.Laxmikant Patil, then DCP, crime, Thane, used a govt vehicle to visit Mantralaya, Vidhan Bhavan, the office of the DGP and Sahyadri guest house in Mumbai, but instead of mentioning the exact location of those offices, on his instructions, his drivers wrote only “Mumbai” in the vehicle’s log book, which created suspicion about his behaviour. It was alleged that Laxmikant Patil exerted pressure on the accused and witnesses.It was also stated that Shukla found that while Punamia was in police custody in a case registered in 2021 in Thane, Patil interrogated him regarding the ULC scam case and pressurised him to give a false statement that Fadnavis extorted money from builders in the ULC scam case.","Former DGP Rashmi Shukla submitted a report to the state home department. She said an offence should be registered against ex-DGP and former Mumbai police commissioner Sanjay Pandey, along with two other police officers. She suggested the govt register an FIR against Pandey and police officers Laxmikant Patil and Sardar Patil for criminal conspiracy.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126461200,imgsize-956532,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/cm-devendra-fadnavis-former-dgp-rashmi-shukla-sanjay-pandey.jpg"
