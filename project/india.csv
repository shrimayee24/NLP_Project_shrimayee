"Pocso court fixes age as per school record, not medical reports",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pocso-court-fixes-age-as-per-school-record-not-medical-reports/articleshow/123007538.cms,"BAREILLY: Pocso court judge Devendra Nath Singh sentenced a man to 10 years of rigorous punishment for kidnaping and raping a minor girl in 2011. The court relied on educational documents to determine that the survivor was a minor (15 years and 15 days) at the time of the crime though the medical reports had suggested her radiological age was around 19 years.The court cited the Supreme Court's judgment in the Mahadev Vs State of Maharashtra (2013) case and said the medical report for determining the age was considered only when educational documents of the survivor were not available. In this case, the court admitted the TC (transfer certificate) of a govt primary school while rejecting the bone density test of the girl.The girl was kidnapped from Lakhimpur Kheri in March 2011 by a car driver and kept confined in a house in Lucknow for nearly two months and forced her to have physical relationship with him. After the girl was rescued by police, she said in her statement that she was repeatedly raped by the accused at gunpoint and was forced to marry him at a temple.ADGC Sanjay Singh said, ""The minor girl's father had lodged a police complaint at Isanagar police station after she went missing. After she was recovered, the accused was booked under IPC sections 376 (rape), 363 (abduction), and 366 (abduction of a woman to compel her marriage).""""The accused claimed not guilty and said the girl eloped with him willingly, but the girl stated she was confined in a house and raped on multiple occasions. The medical report also confirmed sexual assault. The incident was reported before the Pocso Act was enacted,"" said the ADGC. While passing the order on Tuesday, the court also imposed a fine of Rs 16,000 on the convict, of which Rs 10,000 will be awarded to survivor as compensation.",The court relied on educational documents to determine that the survivor was a minor (15 years and 15 days) at the time of the crime.

SC: Police can’t serve notice or summon through WhatsApp or other electronic means,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-police-cant-serve-notice-or-summon-through-whatsapp-or-other-electronic-means/articleshow/123005622.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has ruled WhatsApp or other electronic means cannot be used by police and other investigating agencies to serve notice to an accused to appear before it, Supreme Court has said while rejecting the plea of Haryana govt to allow police to serve notice through electronic means as it would adversely affect the liberty of the person.Pressing for electronic means of serving summons, the state submitted that the new law of Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita allowed use of electronic means for court proceedings for issuance, service and execution of summons and warrant and that should be allowed to police also. But a bench of Justices M M Sundresh and N K Singh said that summons issued by a court is a judicial act, whereas a notice issued by the investigating agency is an executive act and the procedure prescribed for a judicial act cannot be read into the procedure prescribed for an executive act.The court clarified that the issue of liberty is involved in the case of police summon as the person can be arrested for non-compliance of summon and in such cases it is appropriate that such a notice be served in person on the accused, and not through the mode of electronic communication. It accepted the submission of senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who is assisting the court as amicus curiae and told the bench that summons are to be served personally on the person, as per the regular mode of service.""The protection of one's liberty is a crucial aspect of the right to life guaranteed to each and every individual, under Article 21 of the Constitution. The procedure encapsulated in Section 35(6) of the BNSS, 2023, seeks to secure this fundamental right, from encroachment by the relevant Authority, and therefore, any attempt to interpret the provision as a mere procedural one, would amount to rewriting the provision itself . .The Legislature, in its wisdom, has specifically excluded the service of a notice under Section 35 of the BNSS from the ambit of procedures permissible through electronic communication,"" the bench said.""When viewed from any lens, we are unable to convince ourselves that electronic communication is a valid mode of service of notice under Section 35 of the BNSS, since its conscious omission is a clear manifestation of the legislative intent. Introducing a procedure into Section 35 of the BNSS, that has not been specifically provided for by the legislature, would be violative of its intent,"" the Supreme Court bench said.",Supreme Court rules WhatsApp or other electronic means cannot be used by police and other investigating agencies to serve notice to an accused to appear before it.

Inclement weather in J&K also forced the Amarnath Yatra to be halted temporarily for the second time this month.Jagdev Singh and Sanjay Kumar, both residents of Ghordi village of Ramnagar in Udhampur district, were on a motorcycle when they were presumably caught in the flash floods on Nathatop-Sanasar road. The deceased were serving as govt teachers in Udhampur, and were in Ramban to attend a three-day training session at District Institute of Education and Training (DIET) in Kud, which began on July 29.Cops at Patnitop police received information about a motorcycle lying on the roadside at Jalebi Morh nallah. Police teams were joined by SDRF personnel in a search/rescue operation along the seasonal rivulet, and found two bodies about 150 and 300 metres from the link road.The duo was last seen by the locals on Tuesday evening when it was raining heavily in the Sanasar, and were possibly carried away by the strong currents of a mountain stream due to a sudden surge of water, police said.With the MeT department predicting heavy to moderate rains in many parts of J&K over the next three days, the school education board postponed class 12 examinations scheduled for Wednesday in both J&K and Ladakh, and said the revised date would be announced soon.In view of the adverse weather, the authorities on Wednesday suspended the Amarnath Yatra from both Pahalgam and Baltal routes. Jammu divisional commissioner Rakesh Kumar said since the movement of pilgrims from base camps was affected, it had been decided that “no convoy movement shall be allowed towards the base camps Baltal and Nunwan from Bhagwati Nagar, Jammu, on July 31”.The annual pilgrimage was earlier paused on July 17 following a warning of heavy rain in many parts of J&K.","Jagdev Singh and Sanjay Kumar were on a motorcycle when they were presumably caught in the flash floods on Nathatop-Sanasar road.

"Tamil Nadu Kavin Murder: Kavin murder sparks outrage, CB-CID takes over; family refuses body, demands arrests",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/caste-killing-case-transferred-to-cb-cid-accused-detained-under-goondas/articleshow/123003302.cms,"



TIRUNELVELI: The investigation into the murder of 27-year-old dalit man Kavin Selvaganesh has been transferred to the Crime Branch-Criminal Investigation Department (CB-CID), the Tamil Nadu police said in a statement on Wednesday.This was because the parents of the main accused, S Surjith, 23, are serving as sub-inspectors in the Tamil Nadu Special Police Force, it said. Both Saravanan and Krishnakumari, named as co-accused in the FIR, were suspended from service. ""Considering the seriousness and importance of the case, and to guarantee an independent and unbiased investigation, the case has now been handed over to the CB-CID,"" the release added.Earlier in the day, Surjith was detained under Goondas Act following a detention order issued by Tirunelveli commissioner of police Santosh Hadimani.Meanwhile, for the fourth consecutive day, Kavin's parents refused to receive his body, demanding the arrest of Subashini's parents and action against police officials allegedly complicit in the case.Speaking to reporters in Tirunelveli, Kavin's father Chandrasekar alleged that Palayamkottai inspector Kasi Pandian threatened his son 15 days before the murder.""Even now, no senior officer has come forward to investigate. Pandian should be dismissed. If the govt does not act, we will resort to all forms of protest,"" he said.Kavin, a native of Tuticorin district and belonging to the scheduled caste devendra kula vellalar community, was hacked to death on July 27 at KTC Nagar in Tirunelveli. The murder is believed to have been triggered by his relationship with Subashini, a woman from the maravar caste.Meanwhile, A Kathir, founder of the dalit rights NGO Evidence, demanded that Krishnakumari and Saravanan be arrested immediately. At a press conference in Madurai, he claimed that Kavin's family possesses chat records confirming the relationship between Kavin and Subashini. ""This doesn't appear to be a murder executed solely by Surjith. The injury marks on Kavin's body suggest the involvement of trained assailants. The postmortem was done in haste, and we demand a second, transparent autopsy,"" he said.Kathir urged chief minister M K Stalin to respond to the incident, drawing parallels with the custodial death case in Madapuram. He called for a dedicated law to prevent caste-based killings in the state. Later in the evening, senior ministers K N Nehru and Anitha R Radhakrishnan, along with south zone IG Prem Anand Sinha and Tirunelveli city police commissioner Santosh Hadimani, met Kavin's parents and urged the family to receive the body, stating that the case had been transferred to the CB-CID. However, Kavin's parents refused to receive the body, insisting that Surjith's parents must be arrested since they have been named as accused in the FIR.","Kavin Selvaganesh, 27, was hacked to death on July 27 at KTC Nagar in Tirunelveli.
