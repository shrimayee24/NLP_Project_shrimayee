RG Kar horror: ‘Shocked’ Didi says govt will seek death for ‘monster’ in HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rg-kar-horror-shocked-didi-says-govt-will-seek-death-for-monster-in-hc/articleshow/117410886.cms,"KOLKATA: Bengal govt will appeal in high court for the death penalty, CM Mamata Banerjee said Monday while expressing dissatisfaction with the life imprisonment handed to Sanjay Roy , whom she referred to as a “noropishach” (monster).“I am really shocked to see the judgment of the court today finds it is not a rarest of rare case!” Banerjee posted on X. “I am convinced that it is indeed a rarest of rare case which demands capital punishment... We will plead for capital punishment of the convict at the high court now.”During a media address, Banerjee said the outcome might have been different if the investigation had remained with Kolkata police , rather than being handed over to CBI.“If it had been under our purview, we would have ensured the death penalty long ago,” Banerjee said. “I am not aware of how CBI handled the case. The details are theirs to explain. The case was deliberately taken away from us. From the first day, we demanded the death penalty, and we still do.”The CM also highlighted that Bengal police had successfully ensured capital punishment for convicts in similar cases within 54 to 60 days. “Then why in this case has capital punishment not been awarded?” she asked. Banerjee asserted her and TMC’s continued demand for the death penalty, emphasising the severity of the crime. “Everyone wants it (death penalty). Yet, a judge has to consider many aspects before delivering a verdict.”","Bengal govt will appeal in high court for the death penalty, CM Mamata Banerjee said Monday.

KOLKATA: The Sealdah sessions court criticised Kolkata police, particularly officers from Tala police station , for their “mishandling” of the investigation into the rape and murder of a resident doctor at RG Kar Medical College in Aug last year.Judge Anirban Das highlighted Monday in his judgment several lapses and directed the police commissioner to address the “illegal acts” of his officers.“I am of the view that if the officers of Tala PS took proper initiative by applying their intellect at the very first time, the matter would not become so complicated,” the judgment reads, pointing to the failure of police to act promptly and effectively.The court also urged the police commissioner to be “strict” about the “indifferent attitude” of the officers and called for better training to prevent such negligence in the future.SI Subrata Chatterjee at Tala police station was among those hauled up for the way the general diary (GD) was filed. “This evidence of one SI (Chatterjee) is an eye-opener that police stations are treating the cases in a very indifferent manner. I condemn such acts of SI Subrata Chatterjee,” the judgment reads.The court also questioned the delay in allowing the victim’s parents to lodge a complaint, criticising police for keeping them waiting until 6pm although the body was found the morning on Aug 9.ASI Anup Dutta, under whose supervision the civic volunteer Sanjay Roy was working, was reprimanded for his role in the case. Kolkata police arrested Roy on Aug 10, CBI assumed charge of the case three days later, and the trial court sentenced him to life imprisonment Monday.An additional officer-in-charge (OC) was called out for mishandling crucial evidence, particularly for taking the victim’s mobile from Roy on Aug 9 and leaving it unattended at Tala police station. “Her action… is a very curious one,” the judgment reads.","Sealdah sessions court criticises Kolkata police, particularly officers from Tala police station.

Eknath Shinde back in village amid reports of guardian mantri tiff,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/eknath-shinde-back-in-village-amid-reports-of-guardian-mantri-tiff/articleshow/117407736.cms,"Maharashtra deputy CM Eknath Shinde (File photo)

MUMBAI: Amid reports that he was upset about the Shiv Sena not bagging more posts for guardian ministers, deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde left for his native village of Dare in Satara district over the weekend. Shinde refuted the claim that he was miffed with the BJP leadership and said he had come to Satara to review tourism projects. He added though that the issue over appointing guardian ministers would be decisively resolved when the chief minister and the two deputy CMs sit together.“When I come to my village, they start talking about my displeasure. However, I have come to the village for development work here… There is nothing wrong in expecting guardian ministership. Nashik and Raigad's guardian ministership will be resolved soon,” he said. A decision on guardianship of the two districts would come soon, he added. The District Planning and Development Council Funds which are allocated for local works are disbursed on the recommendations of the guardian minister.“Bharat Gogawale has made his displeasure clear, but what is wrong with expecting the guardian minister's post? He has worked in Raigad for the last many years,” Shinde said. Officials said Shinde had called chief minister Devendra Fadnavis late on Sunday and told him to stay appointments for Nashik and Raigad from Davos . Soon afterwards, orders were issued.The rollback in appointments prompted opposition leader and Shiv Sena (UBT) MLA Aaditya Thackeray to target the Mahayuti govt. “Late last night, a “stay” order was issued suddenly for the Guardian Ministries of Nashik and Raigad, while the CM was on a foreign tour. It is surprising to see the CM give in to pressure tactics of greedy politicians, who are already ministers but also want guardian ministries,” Aaditya said in a post on X.“Despite having strong numbers, the CM has given into the bullying of the traitor gang. Imagine, the gang burnt tyres and blocked a highway for an additional post for their leaders. This is how the BJP govt is being bullied by some. While citizens in Beed and Parbhani are struggling for justice, govt turns a blind eye and greedy ministers are busy trying to grab more. This is an insult to the 2 ministers from whom the responsibility has been taken away,” Aaditya said in his post.",Eknath Shinde left for his native village of Dare in Satara district over the weekend.

Supreme Court stays defamation case on Rahul for Shah remark,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-stays-defamation-case-on-rahul-for-shah-remark/articleshow/117410173.cms,"Rahul Gandhi

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday stayed the trial court proceedings against Congress MP Rahul Gandhi in a criminal defamation case filed against him for allegedly making defamatory remarks against home minister Amit Shah during the AICC’s plenary sessions in Jharkhand in 2018.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta issued notice to Jharkhand govt and the complainant seeking their response on Gandhi’s plea for quashing of the criminal proceedings .Abhishek Manu Singhvi , appearing on behalf of Rahul Gandhi, raised a question on how a person, who is not affected by an alleged defamatory statement, could file a complaint. He said the principles regarding this have been settled in at least seven SC judgments. Appearing for the complainant, advocate Mahesh Jethmalani said he was opposing the plea. SC thereafter granted four weeks to Jharkhand govt and complainant Navin Jha to file their responses. “All proceedings shall remain stayed till further orders,” court ordered.Rahul approached SC after his plea for quashing the case was rejected by Jharkhand HC, which said Gandhi’s statement was prima facie defamatory in nature. It noted that Gandhi’s speech had imputed BJP leadership “to be liars drunk with power and that BJP workers will accept a person accused of murder as BJP chief, but people will never accept the same in Congress”.",The Supreme Court on Monday stayed the trial court proceedings against Congress MP Rahul Gandhi in a criminal defamation case filed against him for allegedly making defamatory remarks.

It is serious and has ramifications,” Mehta said and requested six weeks time.

It also proposed reinstating the provision for a referendum to amend the constitution and introducing a bicameral parliament - a lower house (national assembly) and upper house (senate) - to ensure representation for all.Both houses will have terms of four years, meaning govt's and the PM's term will also be four years, the commission has suggested. It has recommended reforms to ensure that the PM can face a no-confidence motion in parliament.To prevent the concentration of power in the hands of an individual or institution, it has proposed the creation of a constitutional body - national constitutional council (NCC) - to establish a system of checks and balances between the three branches of the state and the two executive positions - PM and president.This council would include the president, chief justice, PM, leaders of opposition of both houses, speakers and deputy speakers from the opposition, and a representative of other parties. The commission has recommended decentralising the judiciary by maintaining the unitary structure of Supreme Court, while establishing permanent high court benches with jurisdiction in all divisional cities.It has also provided a framework for an interim govt to be formed after the dissolution of parliament, and recommended that selection of advisers to such govts should be solely the NCC's responsibility.",The Constitution Reform Commission has recommended introducing a two-term limit on the PM's tenure.

They had previously been sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment in the case, which SC termed ""malicious"".Following the verdict, there are now no legal barriers preventing the two-time former PM from contesting the upcoming national elections. Khaleda and her son are currently residing in London.SC overturned the judgments delivered during the regime of ousted PM Sheikh Hasina by the high court and trial court. The trial court had sentenced Khaleda to five years' imprisonment, while Tarique and the other accused received 10 years each. Later, HC doubled Khaleda's sentence to 10 years while upholding trial court's verdict for the other accused.In its ruling, SC observed that the prosecution of the Zia Orphanage Trust case was ""malicious"" and noted that the accused, who did not appeal the HC verdict, would also benefit from this judgment ""restoring their dignity as innocent individuals"".A five-member bench of the appellate division, led by Chief Justice Syed Refaat Ahmed, delivered the unanimous verdict. The ruling came after hearings on two appeals filed by Khaleda and individual appeals made by Kazi Kamal and businessman Sharafuddin Ahmed. Khaleda had initially been jailed on Feb 8, 2018 after a special court in Dhaka sentenced her to five years in prison for her involvement in the case. The other accused - Kazi Kamal, Sharafuddin, Kamal Uddin Siddique and Mominur Rahman - were sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment for misappropriating over BDT 2.1 crore, which was intended as foreign grants for orphans.","Khaleda Zia, her son and BNP acting chairman Tarique Rahman were acquitted on Wednesday by the appellate division of Bangladesh Supreme Court.
