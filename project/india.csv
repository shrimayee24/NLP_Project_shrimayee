Congress delegation stopped



What led to clashes?



NEW DELHI: Uttar Pradesh police on Wednesday heightened security in several districts after state Congress chief Ajay Rai announced that Rahul Gandhi along with 5 other Congress MPs will visit Sambhal.Meanwhile, prohibitory orders are in place in the district until December 10. Curbs under section 163 (power to issue order in urgent cases of nuisance or apprehended danger) of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) were set to expire on Sunday in Sambhal and have now been extended till December 31.Earlier on Tuesday, Sambhal district magistrate Rajendra Pensia wrote a letter to e police commissioners of Gautam Buddh Nagar and Ghaziabad and the superintendents of police of Amroha and Bulandshahr districts, urging them to stop Rahul Gandhi at the borders of their districts.A Congress party delegation, however, slipped into Sambhal and met some families of those who died in Nov 24 violence and were about to leave the district.The delegation included the general secretary of UP Congress Committee (UPCC) Sachin Chaudhary and its vice-president Rizwan Qureshi along with the national secretary of All India Congress Committee Pradeep Narwal and a few members of Gandhi's team.They also facilitated a phone call between Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and the victims' kin. A delegation from Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind (JUH) also visited the violence-hit town and provided ""financial assistance, cheques of Rs 5 lakh each, to the families of the deceased later at a local madrassa"".This comes two days after a Congress delegation led by Ajay Rai was prevented from leaving for Sambhal, which has been out of bounds for parties after the Nov 24 violence.As soon as the Congress functionaries came out of the party headquarters, UP police stopped them on the grounds that the party's request for visit had been denied by the Sambhal district administration .At least 5 people were dead and several others, including over 20 police personnel, were injured in Uttar Pradesh's Sambhal after violent clashes erupted following a court-mandated survey of the Mughal-era Jama Masjid.The survey was ordered following a petition filed by senior advocate Vishnu Shanker Jain, claiming that the mosque was originally a temple.The tension started after a large group of people gathered near the mosque and started shouting slogans as the survey team began their work in the Shahi Jama Masjid.The protesters tried to torch vehicles and pelted stones at the police who used tear gas and batons to disperse the mob.""Gunshots were fired by the miscreants and some pellets struck our policemen. We are investigating where the shots were fired from, particularly in the Deepa Sarai area,"" an officer said.Tension has been brewing in Sambhal over the past few days after the Jama Masjid was surveyed last Tuesday on the orders of a local court following a petition that claimed that a Harihar temple stood at the site.""Some miscreants in the crowd threw stones at the police team. The police used minor force and tear gas to bring the situation under control,"" Superintendent of Police Krishna Kumar Vishnoi said.""We are in the process of registering an FIR in the incident. The accused will also be booked under the NSA,"" the police officer added.Petitioner Vishnu Shankar Jain had said the Court of Civil Judge (Senior Division) ordered the constitution of an ""Advocate Commission"" to survey the mosque. The court has said that a report should be filed after conducting a videography and photography survey through the commission, he had said.",Congress chief Ajay Rai announced that Rahul Gandhi along with 5 other Congress MPs will visit Sambhal. prohibitory orders are in place in the district until December 10.

MUMBAI: Offering a climbdown from his demand of being allowed to continue as the head of the Mahayuti govt, Sena chief Eknath Shinde asked BJP brass at a meeting with Union home minister Amit Shah in Delhi last week that if it wasn't possible to give him the post for govt's full term, he should be made the CM for at least the first six months, a veteran politician has revealed. But BJP leadership rejected this proposal outright, saying it would set a bad precedent, he said.""There is no system of appointing a CM for six months; it would be a bad decision and would have an adverse impact on the administration,"" he said, citing BJP functionaries.The meeting was held on Nov 28 a day after Shinde said he would not be an obstacle to formation of govt and would accept any decision taken by BJP brass as ""final"". It was also attended by BJP functionary Devendra Fadnavis , NCP president Ajit Pawar, its working president Praful Patel and its state chief Sunil Tatkare.According to the politician, Shinde initially reminded BJP brass of the purported promise made after the Lok Sabha election and in the run-up to the assembly polls that if the alliance secured a clear majority, he would be retained as the chief minister. This request was rejected outright on the grounds that it would be wrong to give him the post when BJP secured ""a near clear majority"" in the 288-member House. BJP won 132 seats, Sena 57 and NC. In 2014, BJP had secured 122 seats and Fadnavis was then elected as CM with NCP's outside support.In response, Shinde was asked to put himself in the shoes of the BJP president, the politician said. ""The BJP leadership told Shinde: 'Will you give up the claim to the CM post if you secured a clear majority?' Shinde was left speechless,"" he said.Shinde reportedly began advocating for himself strongly since the assembly poll results but Fadnavis had made it clear there was no scope for him to be made the chief minister again. The politician said no call has been taken on how big the cabinet will be. It may be decided after BJP's legislature party meeting on Wednesday.Shinde had left for his native village in Satara a day after the Delhi meeting owing to ill health and returned to Mumbai on Sunday. On his return, he reiterated that he would support any decision BJP brass takes on the next CM and that he, Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar would meet and resolve ""a lot of issues regarding power sharing"".","Sena chief Eknath Shinde offered a climbdown from his demand of being allowed to continue as the head of the Mahayuti govt.

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Manickam Tagore on Tuesday rejected the idea of West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee becoming leader of the INDIA bloc terming the suggestion a ""joke"".""That's a good joke,"" Tagore quipped when asked about TMC leaders' remarks.This comes after TMC MP Kirti Azad asserted that Mamata was a better face to lead the opposition bloc adding that she had a perfect record against BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.""Mamata Banerjee has a perfect record. Whenever Narendra Modi has faced defeat, it has always been in West Bengal. Even in the recent by-elections, where the BJP had one seat and we had five, Mamata Didi hit a six and threw Narendra Modi out of the West Bengal boundary. Every time he comes to Bengal intending to insult, his vote count increases, and she, a very senior leader, continues to clearly express her views,"" Azad said.""While the Indian government has said nothing despite the serious situation in Bangladesh, she has stated that if the Indian government does not act, the United Nations should step in to protect minorities wherever they are. Mamata Banerjee is not just a leader but a movement present in every household in West Bengal,"" he added.The TMC MP further said that Mamata takes everyone along with respect.""Mamata Didi is someone who takes everyone along. She prepares thoroughly before calling people for meetings. There are times when emergency meetings are held, but she ensures that all her people are invited with respect and engages in dialogue with her allies,"" Azad said.Mamata Banerjee's party is working out its own space within the INDIA bloc, essentially to have its own say within the group, even while Congress remains the largest party and hence gets to lead the opposition charge. Congress’ recent electoral defeats in Haryana and Maharashtra and TMC’s victory in the Bengal bypolls have pushed the regional party into taking its own line, rather than following Congress, while remaining within the opposition bloc.Earlier, referring to the MVA's poor performance, TMC leader Kalyan Banerjee said that the whole alliance failed to meet expectations in the absence of a leader.""Today, if we genuinely want to fight against the BJP and Narendra Modi, the INDIA alliance must be stronger. To achieve that, one decisive leader is necessary. The key question now is: who will that leader be?""

The meeting lasted around 45 minutes.Earlier in the day, BJP's Girish Mahajan met Shinde and Sena's Uday Samant met Fadnavis at the latter's Sagar residence.
