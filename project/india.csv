"Rahul Gandhi's remarks a sinister attempt to demonise Hindus, Hindutva: RSS functionary",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rahul-gandhis-remarks-a-sinister-attempt-to-demonise-hindus-hindutva-rss-functionary/articleshow/111647489.cms,"NEW DELHI: A senior RSS functionary, in the latest edition of Sangh inspired “Organiser” weekly, has maintained that the recent statement by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in Parliament that ‘those who called themselves Hindu are violent, spread hatred and falsehood’ is a sinister attempt to demonise Hindus, Hindutva and a scripted conspiracy to divide society by pushing a repackaged Nehruvian Secularism on to the Indian psyche.“Although there has been an attempt by Left-Liberal-Islamist ecosystem to create a binary between Hinduism and Hindutva, their efforts did not bear fruit due to their declining political clout. But with a slightly renewed mandate in the recent Lok Sabha election , they try to push this dangerous narrative upon the country,” senior Sangh functionary J Nandakumar has written in the latest edition of the Weekly.Nandkumar has further stated that the statement made by Gandhi was a plain attempt to create confusion and chaos in the country and among Hindus in particular and reap political harvest.He has also claimed that Hindu Dharma does not give any individual or sect a mandate to brand any person ‘non-believer’ or fake. “By doing this, with his lopsided understanding of the concept of Shiva, Rahul Gandhi has tried to graft Abrahamic approach on the Hindu Dharma,” Nandakumar has said.The RSS functionary’s remarks are a counter to parts of Gandhi’s first speech as leader of opposition recently in the Lok Sabha where he made mends when Prime Minister Narendra Modi objected, saying, ""Calling entire Hindu community violent is a very serious matter.""The RSS functionaries’ detailed observations carried prominently in the Weekly magazine inspired by the Sangh is yet another example of its firm support to the BJP and its bid complementing the political outfit over narratives targeted against them and their common ideologies.Taking a cue from PM Modi equating Gandhi’s remarks as “Balak Buddhi”, the RSS functionary has stated that “several commentators” have dismissed Rahul Gandhi’s statement as a juvenile attempt to corner the BJP leadership.“Raising the photograph of Bhagwan Shiva (thank God, he spared Allah – so his head is in the right place) in the house was not without a purpose. It’s part of a well-thought-out global plan to divide and emaciate the Hindu society by forces who have their handlers in foreign lands,” Nandakumar has observed.He has also highlighted how the Congress associates, especially in South, have already planned to build an ‘architecture of hate and anarchy’ by pushing the old Aryan-Dravidian narrative in a new format.“A ‘Muruga conclave’ is being planned to pit Bhagwan Karthikeya against ‘North Indian invader’ Bhagwan Ram. Sometime ago, a DMK leader had said: ‘Who is Ram? Ram has no relevance in the South.’ By this exercise, they propose to drive wedge between Saivaites and Vaishnavaites,” he has written.","A senior RSS functionary has maintained that the recent statement by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in Parliament is a sinister attempt to demonise Hindus, Hindutva and a scripted conspiracy to divide society. “By doing this, with his lopsided understanding of the concept of Shiva, Rahul Gandhi has tried to graft Abrahamic approach on the Hindu Dharma,” he has said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111647486,imgsize-821680,width-400,resizemode-4/111647486.jpg"

In his first speech in Parliament as leader of the opposition, the Congress leader accused BJP leaders of dividing people along communal lines during the debate on the Motion of Thanks for the President's address.In response, Prime Minister Narendra Modi claimed that Gandhi had referred to the ""entire Hindu community as violent."" To this, Rahul Gandhi replied, “Narendra Modi ji is not the entire Hindu community, the BJP is not the entire Hindu community, the RSS is not the entire Hindu community”.Swami Avimukteshwarananda, in a now-viral video, asserted that Gandhi's speech did not contradict Hinduism , stating, ""We heard Rahul Gandhi's entire speech. He is clearly saying that there is no place for violence in Hinduism."" ""I saw his entire video and found out that he had not said anything wrong,"" Swami Avimukteshwarananda replied when a journalist sought his views on Rahul's remarks in Parliament.Prashant Bhushan, senior lawyer and activist, posted the video on X, and said, ""Shankaracharya pointing out that Rahul didn’t say anything against Hindu religion. The channels & BJP IT cell spreading disinformation against him should be prosecuted.""The Shankaracharya also pointed out that spreading only a part of Gandhi's statement was incorrect and called for the punishment of those responsible for doing so. “Spreading half-truths by editing speeches is a crime, and such people should be punished, whether they are from a newspaper or a channel … Later, Rahul Gandhi clarified that his statement was directed at the party led by the Centre, alleging that they are promoting violence under the guise of religion,” the Shankaracharya added.Priyanka Gandhi, Congress MP, also defended her brother, saying, ""My brother (Rahul) can never speak against Hindus. He has spoken about BJP and about BJP leaders.""The remarks by Rahul Gandhi had caused an uproar in the Lok Sabha, leading to several statements being struck off the record by the Speaker.","Swami Avimukteshwarananda, the 46th Shankaracharya of Jyotir Math in Uttarakhand, came out in support of Rahul Gandhi's comments in Lok Sabha.

West Bengal wins round 1 versus Centre in Supreme Court on CBI probes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/west-bengal-wins-round-1-versus-centre-in-supreme-court-on-cbi-probes/articleshow/111645245.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Wednesday trashed the multiple grounds cited by Centre to seek dismissal of West Bengal 's constitutional suit raising a Centre-state dispute on CBI allegedly illegally carrying out probes in the state despite the Trinamool Congress govt's revocation of the general consent to the agency to start probes on its own.Rejecting preliminary objections raised by SG Tushar Mehta seeking dismissal of the suit and accepting contentions of advocates Kapil Sibal and Abhishek Singhvi, who appeared for WB, a bench of Justices B R Gavai and Sandeep Mehta posted the suit for framing of issues on Aug 13.Centre's main contention was that CBI is neither a state, nor its investigation supervised by the Centre, and hence the state cannot claim any relief against Union govt. As the state's grievances are mainly against CBI, it could not have filed a suit without making the central agency a party.Dealing with Mehta's submissions, the bench said, ""We find that SG's contention that even if CBI, being an independent agency, is considered to be an instrumentality of the State under Article 12 of Constitution, it cannot be equated with Government of India as contemplated under Article 131 of Constitution, in our view, holds no water.""Writing the 74-page judgment, Justice Gavai said, ""In our view, CBI is an organ or a body, which is established by and which is under superintendence of Govt of India in view of the statutory scheme as enacted by the DSPE Act.""He said, ""No doubt that powers of superintendence of central govt would not relate to superintendence of investigation of a particular case (which is vested with Central Vigilance Commission by a judgment of SC) and the probe agency (CBI) would always be entitled to investigate the offences independently.""""However, that would not water down the administrative control and superintendence of DSPE that vests with Centre. In that view of the matter, we find that the contention in that regard needs to be rejected,"" the bench said.It said, ""It is the case of WB (plaintiff) that CBI is established (under Delhi Special Police Establishment Act) by the Union govt (defendant), its exercise of powers is controlled by the defendant and its functioning is also under the superintendence of the defendant. Therefore, it cannot be said that the plaintiff has not made out any cause of action against the defendant.""SC said under the DSPE Act, CBI can probe a case in a state only after a notification is issued by Centre specifying the case and area involved in the particular case with prior consent of the state govt.West Bengal in its suit filed under Article 131 of the Constitution had argued that it withdrew general consent on Nov 16, 2018, CBI could not have continued to register cases and exercise its powers under the DSPE Act. ""Continuation of registration of cases and exercise of powers after withdrawal of the consent is an act of constitutional overreach,"" the state contended.","Supreme Court trashes the multiple grounds cited by Centre to seek dismissal of West Bengal's constitutional suit.

BJP Plans 'mega' protest in Mysuru

BENGALURU: Opposition BJP intensified its attack on chief minister Siddaramaiah , releasing a set of documents to “substantiate” claims that Mysuru Urban Development Authority (Muda) had favoured the CM’s wife by illegally allotting land.Presenting what he called “vital documents”, Karnataka BJP president BY Vijayendra alleged serious violations and discrepancies involving Siddaramaiah and his family and called for him to resign.“If any chief minister engineered a scam while being at the helm and sought compensation from his own govt, it is Siddaramaiah,” Vijayendra said.He proceeded to outline specifics of the alleged scam, pointing to irregularities in allotment of land to Siddaramaiah’s wife, Parvathi alias Parvathamma. He said as per rules, she should have been allotted only two alternative 60x40ft sites for her 3.2 acres that was acquired, but instead, she was allotted 14 sites. “This is totally illegal,” Vijayendra said.Vijayendra claimed Siddaramaiah did not declare these properties in his election affidavit in 2013, calling it a “blatant violation” of Representation of the People Act 1951 and the model code of conduct (MCC) which was in effect at that time. “BJP is contemplating filing a formal complaint with the Election Commission of India,” he said.Vijayendra also highlighted the timeline and legal discrepancies surrounding the acquisition and subsequent transactions involving Siddaramaiah’s relatives. “The land was acquired by Muda before it was purchased by CM’s brother-in-law and later given to CM’s wife through a gift deed,” he said. He disputed Siddaramaiah’s claims of receiving sites whose market value was far lower than the price of land Muda acquired. “He got a total of 14 sites each worth more than Rs 2 crore,” he said, challenging the discrepancy between guidance values and actual market prices.Disputing remarks Siddaramaiah’s associates had made at a press conference that Muda began the acquisition process in 1992, denotified the land in 1998 and that it was purchased in 2004 by the CM’s brother-in-law, he said: “The RTC (primary record of land ownership), clearly shows the land was already acquired by Muda. If this is true, the first question is how CM’s brother-in-law purchased the land that was in Muda’s possession. The gift deed also wrongfully states the acquired land is farmland. On the date the land was gifted, it was already converted and was not agricultural land.”Vijayendra accused urban development minister Byrathi Suresh of shielding Siddaramaiah and implicating officials through strategic transfers. “More than Rs 5,000 crore worth of sites allotted illegally to influential people were protected through these transfers. Several important files at Muda have been taken away to protect the CM.”Accusing the govt of misconduct and deception, he said: “Siddaramaiah, who boasts of ensuring social justice now stands exposed.”BJP will hold a “mega” rally in Mysuru on July 12 to protest the Muda scam . Protesters will demand withdrawal of sites that were illegally distributed and allocation of sites to the poor. They will also reiterate demands for a CBI investigation into these irregularities. Vijayendra said BJP will also raise the issue during the legislative session beginning next week.Muda scam: BJP releases ‘ vital documents ’, says CM is corruptPROOF OF WRONGDOING?
