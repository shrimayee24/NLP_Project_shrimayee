"Poll Outcome: Haryana farmers move on, leaving protest issues behind",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/poll-outcome-haryana-farmers-move-on-leaving-protest-issues-behind/articleshow/114103068.cms,"Farmer's protest

NEW DELHI: The farmer protests , billed as the catalyst behind AAP’s win in Punjab, failed to yield similar output for Congress in Haryana where even a prominent farm agitation leader Gurnam Singh Charuni , who could garner only 1,170 votes, lost his deposit from Pehoba assembly seat.While state agriculture minister Kanwar Pal was among the eight ministerial casualties despite BJP surprising even pollsters, after western Uttar Pradesh, Haryana poll outcome indicates that farmers haven’t rejected government's farm policies.Though the Congress candidate Mandeep Chatha won from the Pehoba seat defeating his BJP rival by over 6500 votes, Charuni’s performance shows the year-long agitation during 2020-21 was a thing of the past in Haryana. The farmers seem to have moved on after the government repealed the three farm laws — the key demand of protesters — without being carried away by the change of goalpost by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) that spearheaded the agitation.Legal guarantee on procurement of all crops at minimum support price (MSP) became the key demand of SKM, something that Congress promised to implement if voted to power after a decade in opposition. But with the BJP government in the state offering MSP for crops other than wheat and paddy, the pre-poll proposal in the manifesto had less appeal as procurement during the last season broke previous records.Besides, Haryana farmers have diversified enough towards horticulture crops — non-MSP produce — to become less dependent on government-assisted procurement unlike Punjab where much larger sown area under paddy and wheat makes the state more dependent on the government’s intervention.Haryana is also more industrialised than Punjab through industrial clusters in several parts of the state as well as rice mills, offering people employment opportunities that go beyond tilling farms. Faridabad, Panipat, Kurukshetra, Hissar and Gurgaon-Manesar belt absorb a large number of workers unlike Punjab where industrialists have fled the state due to high power tariffs, poor policies as well as safety concerns in recent months.BJP’s victory in Haryana may, however, see continuation of deadlock between government and protesting farmers as the latter continue to press for legal guarantee to MSP. Although no fresh agitation is expected in the state, protesting farmers may continue the blockade at Shambhu Border along Punjab-Haryana unless the Supreme Court steps in to resolve the crisis by ordering removal of protesters from the current site.",The farmer protests failed to yield similar output for Congress in Haryana. A prominent farm agitation leader Gurnam Singh Charuni lost his deposit from Pehoba assembly seat.

Congress's 'alliance of convenience' comes under fire as Haryana loss wipes out Lok Sabha gains,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congresss-alliance-of-convenience-comes-under-fire-as-haryana-loss-wipes-out-lok-sabha-gains/articleshow/114087221.cms,"'Overconfident and arrogant'

'SP snubs Congress'

'Congress ignores regional parties when ... '

'This attitude leads to electoral losses '

NEW DELHI: The Congress, which was riding high on its success in Lok Sabha elections, has literally fallen flat after the party's stunning defeat in Haryana assembly elections. The Haryana results have left the Congress bleeding - with not just the BJP but even the INDIA bloc partners unsparing in their attacks on the grand-old-party.Prime Minister Narendra Modi unleashed a scathing attack on the Congress calling it an ""irresponsible party"" and a ""factory to spread hatred."" He also accused the Congress of dividing Hindu society for its political gains and scaring Muslims into becoming party's votebank.But it is not PM Modi's sharp attacks that may rattle the Congress. The party would be more worried about the fallout of this result on its role as the fulcrum of the INDIA bloc.Unfortunately for the Congress, Haryana elections have reinforced two perceptions that go against the party in INDIA bloc. First, the Congress cannot defeat the BJP alone in direct contests; and second, the Congress does not make efforts to take its allies together in states where it has a strong presence or where it is confident of winning alone.In Haryana, the Congress and AAP held discussions for seat sharing after Rahul Gandhi urged the state unit to explore possibilities of contesting the elections under INDIA banner. However, the talks failed to materialise and the two parties contested as rivals in the state.The AAP, which failed to open its account in the state, has claimed that the results would have been different had the two parties contested together. However, results show that AAP alliance could have helped Congress gain only four more seats - Assandh, Dabwali, Uchhana Kalan and Rania. In all these four seats, the voted polled by AAP candidates was more than the Congress's defeat margin. Two of these seats were won by the BJP and the other two by the INLD.Calling Congress ""overconfident and arrogant"", AAP has announced that it will go solo in Delhi assembly polls next year. ""In Delhi, AAP will contest alone. We are capable of fighting the overconfident Congress and arrogant BJP alone,"" party spokesperson Priyanka Kakkar said.On Tuesday, AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal had said the biggest lesson from the recent round of elections was one should not be ""overconfident"".In Uttar Pradesh, the Samajwadi Party went a step ahead and unilaterally announced 6 out of the 10 candidates for assembly bypolls due in the state. This despite the fact that the two parties had contested the assembly polls in alliance under the INDIA banner.The Samajwadi Party also has had a bitter alliance experience with the Congress in Madhya Pradesh when during assembly elections, it was openly snubbed on seat sharing. Kamal Nath who led the Congress campaign in the state refused to acknowledge Akhilesh Yadav's party as an alliance partner.The Shiv Sena (UBT) also trained its guns on the Congress and accused it of ignoring other parties that resulted in Haryana poll debacle. Party leader Sanjay Raut said the Congress' ""over confidence"" was responsible for its defeat in Haryana, alleging that it relies on allies only in regions where they are weak but ignores them in its stronghold areas.""Wherever the Congress is weak, it takes help from the regional parties. But where it thinks it is strong, the Congress attaches no importance to the regional parties,"" Raut said.""We could win in Jammu and Kashmir because the INDIA bloc was fighting there under the leadership of Omar Abdullah and Farooq Abdullah. In Haryana, the INDIA bloc did not fight together because the Congress thought they could win on their own. Hooda ji is our friend, he thought he could win on his own,"" he said.Another Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Priyanka Chaturvedi said the Congress needs to introspect over its loss as it was in direct contest with the BJP. ""The Congress has to introspect. There was a direct contest with the BJP. Where did they all fall short? I am sure they will analyse that,"" she said.TMC MP Saket Gokhale took potshots at Congress without naming the party and slammed its attitude of not accommodating regional parties in places where they felt they were winning is leading to electoral losses.""This attitude leads to electoral losses -- if we feel we're winning, we will not accommodate any regional party... But in states where we're down, regional parties must accommodate us,"" the TMC MP said in a post on X.""Arrogance, entitlement and looking down on regional parties is a recipe for disaster,"" he said.Even National Conference vice-president Omar Abdullah had a piece of advice for his ally. ""The Congress will have to go deep into it and find the reasons for its defeat,"" Abdullah said.Clearly, the Haryana debacle will reduce Congress's bargaining power within the INDIA bloc. Elections are due in Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Delhi. In all these states, the party is an alliance partner with other INDIA bloc parties.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi unleashed a scathing attack on the Congress calling it an ""irresponsible party"" and a ""factory to spread hatred"" The Shiv Sena (UBT) accused the Congress of ignoring other parties that resulted in Haryana poll debacle.

Be it IB, experts, survey reports, but what happened was that when the counting of postal ballots started, Congress was leading everywhere, but when the counting of EVMs started, Congress was lagging behind.

In a letter to party chief Mallikarjun Kharge, EC said the “unprecedented statement (by Ramesh and Khera)...unheard of in the rich democratic heritage of the country, is far from a legitimate part of free speech and expression and moves towards an undemocratic rejection of the will of the people...”The standoff between Election Commission and Congress intensified on Wednesday. A day after Congress, in a first for a national party, refused to accept the Haryana verdict dubbing it “unexpected and unacceptable”, top party leaders met the EC and submitted a memorandum demanding a thorough probe even as the poll panel slammed Congress leaders Jairam Ramesh and Pawan Khera for their “unprecedented” statement that the results were “unacceptable”, saying it amounted to “undemocratic rejection of the will of the people”.A Congress delegation comprising former CMs Bhupinder Singh Hooda and Ashok Gehlot and party leaders K C Venugopal, Jairam Ramesh, Ajay Maken and Pawan Khera and Haryana Congress chief Udai Bhan met the EC and demanded that all the machines for which complaints have been made should be sealed and secured till the inquiry was completed. Senior party leader Abhishek Singhvi joined the meeting online.The poll panel made a distinction between the statements of Congress spokespersons Ramesh and Khera and party president Mallikarjun Kharge’s response to the result. Unlike the two spokespersons, Kharge refrained from rejecting the result, limiting himself to describing it as “unexpected”. EC said it agreed to hear the Congress delegation on EVM grievances only because it considered the party president’s position not rejecting the outcome, and not that of the two spokespersons, to be the party’s official stance.In a strongly-worded letter to Kharge, EC said the “unprecedented statement (by Ramesh and Khera)... in a generic sense, unheard in the rich democratic heritage of India, is far from a legitimate part of free speech and expression and moves towards an undemocratic rejection of the will of the people expressed in accordance with the statutory and regulatory electoral framework, uniformly applied across all polls in the country, including J&K and Haryana”.The stand taken by Jairam and Khera had raised many eyebrows as no national party had so far outright rejected polls, something which is a regular feature in many countries.Though Congress said EVM issues were raised in seven assembly constituencies with no action taken by the returning officer (RO), EC sources told TOI that six complaints were received during counting in Haryana, of which only one related to discrepancy in the battery life of EVMs. “All these complaints were disposed of by RO before declaration of the results. Congress candidates concerned signed the result sheet. Yet, they are now flooding EC with complaints,” an EC functionary said.As per Section 81 of Representation of the People’s Act, 1951, once the result is declared by the RO, it can only be challenged by filing an election petition in the high court within 45 days. “All parties are well versed with these provisions but end up publicly making EVMs or EC the fall guy to build a narrative and cover up their electoral defeat. This noise is rarely followed up with election petitions,” a former legal advisor to EC said.Barely 92 election petitions were filed within the 45-day timeframe after 2024 Lok Sabha elections, as against 138 filed post the 2019 LS polls.In its memorandum addressed to the chief election commissioner, Congress said, “During counting of votes for Haryana, a glaring discrepancy was discovered by INC candidates and their respective polling agents related to the battery charge/health/capacity of the EVM machines.”","The standoff between Election Commission and Congress intensified on Wednesday.

Not really, if we look solely at the arithmetic. There were only three seats of the 53 that Congress did not win in which AAP got more votes than the margin for the eventual winner.Thus, even if we were to assume that a Congress-AAP alliance would have garnered all of the votes that Congress and AAP got contesting on their own, the alliance would at best have won three more seats taking the tally to 40 against the 37 that Congress actually won.Of the three seats, only one was actually won by the BJP. That was Assandh in Karnal district, where BJP got 54,761 votes, beating the Congress tally of 52,455 by 2,306 votes. The AAP candidate here received 4,290 votes.The other two seats were the only ones that INLD won in the state - Dabwali and Rania in Sirsa district.In Dabwali, INLD got 56,074 votes and Congress 55,464 which meant INLD won by 610 votes. The AAP candidate got 6,606 votes. In Rania, INLD got 43,914 and Congress 39,723 to lose by 4,191 votes. AAP got 4,697 votes.If we assume the votes would have been seamlessly transferred between Congress and AAP, these three seats could have been won by an alliance between the two. That would have meant 47 seats to BJP, 40 to the Congress-AAP alliance and none for INLD, which would not have changed the outcome though reducing the gap.Of course, alliances are not just about arithmetic, but whether an alliance between the two parties would have generated a buzz for AAP and Congress is a moot question.","There were only three seats of the 53 that Congress did not win in which AAP got more votes than the margin for the eventual winner.

NC unlikely to reverse 10% ST quota for Paharis in J&K,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nc-unlikely-to-reverse-10-st-quota-for-paharis-in-jk/articleshow/114099768.cms,"SRINAGAR: There is unlikely to be a reversal of the 10% ST reservation carved out for the Pahari community in J&K, National Confernce sources said Wednesday, arguing that rolling back the quota could lead to agitations which would not be in the interest of the new party-led govt.The reservation, unveiled ahead of the J&K assembly polls, results of which were declared Tuesday, was seen as part of political quid pro quo struck by BJP with the Pahari community.But, BJP failed to win in Rajouri and Poonch areas which are populated by Paharis.The quota issue remains a heartburn among the youth and the non-reserved classes as total reservation in J&K has increased to 70%, majorly shrinking the space for open merit. During the poll campaign, protesters had demanded that the new govt reverse the policy, with claims that the 10% quota is disproportionately higher to the population of the beneficiaries.Out of the eight seats in Poonch and Rajouri, BJP could win only Kalakot, while NC won four, two went to Independents and one to Congress. These are the pockets where BJP had high hopes of expanding its footprint.Ahead of the polls, the UT administration announced 10% reservation for Paharis and three other communities, besides the existing 10% ST reservation that includes Gujjars/Bakarwals.NC sources ruled out a revision, arguing that quota is a sensitive subject, and taking back what has been given can touch off protests which would not be in the interest of the new regime.""I don't think we can touch the status quo. It will create a headache and open a new political front. As is it, with what the Centre has done to the powers of the state, there are already many fronts open,"" a top NC functionary said.The failure of BJP to capitalize on the Pahari reservation brought a sense of relief to NC and Congress who ""were worried about its fallout"" in the elections. Their major fear was that it could help BJP win in Muslim areas of Poonch and Rajouri, which would have been at the cost of the ""secular"" parties. Finally, BJP was confined to 29 MLAs.""We were worried. Only Budhal in Rajouri has majority of Gujjar community, while the other seven seats have Paharis in higher numbers,"" said the NC functionary, suggesting that BJP could have won up to seven seats if Paharis had voted for it in big numbers in Nowshera, Poonch, Mendhar, Rajouri, Thanamandi and Surankote.Now, BJP's failure has become a source of satire on social media, with people mocking that the party was fooled by its greed for power into giving a 10% quota.","The reservation was seen as part of political quid pro quo struck by BJP with the Pahari community.

BJP's pro-Dalit policies beat Congress quota narrative: Experts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjps-pro-dalit-policies-beat-congress-quota-narrative-experts/articleshow/114099616.cms,"BJP workers celebrate party's victory in Haryana (Photo credit: PTI)

NEW DELHI: BJP swept all the seven seats reserved for Scheduled Castes in Jammu, while bagging eight of the 17 in Haryana , leading its functionaries to claim that Congress 's allegation that the Modi govt was conspiring to scrap caste quotas has petered out.In 2019, BJP had won five seats reserved for SCs in Haryana while Congress won six. In the 2014 polls in Jammu & Kashmir, before delimitation in 2022 which resulted in an increase of seats from 83 to 90, BJP won five seats reserved for SCs in Jammu and Congress bagged one.Speaking at the post-poll celebrations at BJP headquarters on Tuesday evening, PM Narendra Modi had highlighted BJP's strong performance in constituencies reserved for SCs.""People have seen through the falsehood Rahul Gandhi spread during Lok Sabha polls,"" Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan, who was in-charge of BJP's Haryana campaign, said.The highest winning margin among reserved seats in Haryana was recorded in Pataudi, where BJP's Bimla Chaudhary defeated Congress's Pearl Choudhary by 46,530 votes. In Jammu, the largest winning margin was seen in Akhnoor constituency, where BJP's Mohan Lal defeated Congress's Ashok Kumar by 24,679 votes.Anand Kumar, retired professor of sociology at JNU, said BJP's improved showing in Haryana was because of Congress's projection of B S Hooda as its CM candidate at the cost of Kumari Selja, former Union minister and the party's biggest Dalit face in Haryana. The two previous tenures of Hooda were identified with Jat hegemony and instances of high-handedness against Dalits, especially the killing of two Dalits in Mirchpur.BJP talked up the incidents during the campaign, besides accusing Congress of marginalising Selja because of her Dalit background. The party also supported the demand for sub-categorisation of Dalits in the state to ensure that the benefits of quotas travel beyond the Jatavs to the more disadvantaged SC categories: a social agglomerate of several castes which put together match the numbers of Jatavs, the single most numerically preponderant Dalit caste in the state.Dr Manoj Kumar, a political commentator who teaches at Delhi University, said the Modi govt's focus on ""inclusive development"" since 2014 has led to many sections of SCs developing a positive view of BJP. ""Congress's narrative may have worked before the Lok Sabha elections but it was unlikely to resonate forever,"" he said.Prof Ashwini Kumar of the School of Development Studies put Congress's dismal showing in the SC seats of Jammu, and rise of BJP's share in the ones in Haryana to the latter's weakness against the Modi-led saffron outfit in bipolar contexts. ""This is a reflection of their general weakness,"" he said.","BJP swept all the seven seats reserved for Scheduled Castes in Jammu, while bagging eight of the 17 in Haryana.

Naya Kashmir? BJP's Jammu confinement reeks of the old,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/naya-kashmir-bjps-jammu-confinement-reeks-of-the-old/articleshow/114099606.cms,"SRINAGAR: PM Modi's ""Naya Kashmir "" turned out to be so yesterday on Tuesday.The National Conference-Congress alliance, flagging the fear of BJP in the wake of the revocation of special status and downgrading of J&K as UT, swept the Kashmir region. Despite Congress 's failure to damage BJP in Jammu in the face of the latter's overwhelming campaign which included the push for ""Dogra CM"", J&K delivered a verdict that is bound to sound warning bells in the Delhi establishment.NC patriarch Farooq Abdullah called the results a ""people's rejection of the decisions of August 5, 2019"".That BJP became the bogeyman of the election is spotlighted by two facts. While PDP was punished for its 2014-18 alliance govt with BJP, that was followed by the abrogation of Article 370 , the much-touted ""X-factors"" - Engineer Rashid, Apni Party, DPAP of Ghulam Nabi Azad and Independents - were swept away amid avalanche of allegations of being ""Delhi's fronts"" sent to divide the votes of the mainstream parties to later emerge as pillars of a BJP govt. Engineer's Awami Ittehad Party failed even in Baramulla that he won in Lok Sabha elections from prison. The clear verdict also puts the INDIA alliance beyond the fear of ""five nominated MLAs"", a major row that erupted ahead of the results.Omar Abdullah's decision to junk PDP after being part of the post-370 Gupkar Alliance was vindicated, having already defeated PDP in the Lok Sabha polls in June. Now, PDP is staring at an existential crisis.The return of NC restores the salience of Sheikh Abdullah family in J&K politics, which came to battle a two-front challenge over last two decades - while emergence of PDP erected a rival in Kashmir and Jammu regions both, the post-2014 BJP fragmented the state into parallel political entities and established its dominance in the Hindu pockets of Jammu. The twin developments majorly diminished the space for NC.Evidently, BJP started the 2024 assembly elections with a special strategy. Convinced of its hold over Jammu, it took a leap of faith by creating ""proxies"" in Kashmir to fill the future numbers gap. The ""proxies"" came at the cost of PDP which haemorrhaged its leadership structure, losing 43 important faces by a calculation. First to go was Altaf Bukhari who launched Apni Party, and when he was seen floundering came the exit of Ghulam Nabi Azad from Congress who formed DPAP. Both faced charges of being BJP's fronts. But when they failed to live up to their initial promise, the victory of Engineer over Omar in LS polls threw up a new and more viable option for BJP. To the shock of all, he secured bail to campaign, reinforcing the ""proxy"" charge. In the end, they all came a cropper.BJP's 29 seats mark a decent tally but impresses its continued ghettoisation in Jammu, with signs of stagnation. It is a disappointment for its strategy to win over Muslim communities with reservation for Paharis, to expand its footprint.The party won 25/37 seats in 2014 state polls held after Modi’s advent on the national scene, and led in 25 assembly segments in the post-Pulwama 2019 LS polls, then leading in 29 assemblies out of post-delimitation 43 segments in 2024 LS polls. Jammu-based journalist Mohit Kandhari says, “For BJP to now end up with the same 29, and that too with very close margins on some of the Hindu seats against Congress, is a cause of concern as it was eyeing to finally break out of its stronghold.”While the results now pose a problem for NC which would need some Hindu faces to join the govt, a predicament which supposedly saw late Mufti Mohd Sayeed to strike an alliance with BJP in 2014, the Abdullahs are unlikely to go down the PDP road. But the greater dilemma will be for BJP which has seen junking of the special status has not gone down well in Kashmir, even as it does not animate Jammu so much.The mandate is clearly a rewind to the old days of Jammu & Kashmir, sans 370.","NC patriarch Farooq Abdullah called the results a ""people's rejection of the decisions of August 5, 2019"" The much-touted ""X-factors"" - Engineer Rashid, Apni Party, DPAP of Ghulam Nabi Azad and Independents - were swept away.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114099750,imgsize-56852,width-400,resizemode-4/114099750.jpg"

The case originated from a tip-off purportedly received by crime branch inspector K C Ashokan on May 7, 2012 about Rehman getting introduced to LeT operatives through Pasha and Khoya, both of whom he met in Bengaluru jail after their arrest on different charges.The prosecution linked all three to a conspiracy allegedly hatched by LeT to recruit Muslim youth for terrorist activities, including blasts in Bengaluru.A trial court convicted the trio of criminal conspiracy and waging war against the state, for which they were sentenced to life and additional 5-10 years under UAPA and the Explosive Substances Act.The division bench hearing their appeal pointed out that the UAPA case was not referred to an independent review authority, as mandated by law. “In view of this, the sanction order (to invoke UAPA) loses its sanctity, which the trial court failed to consider,” it said. The court also pointed out that “mere meetings” in jail among the trio and their call details were insufficient to infer conspiracy, and that the evidence did not support their conviction. It directed the state govt to deport Khoya to Pakistan.","Karnataka HC acquits three convicts, one of them a Pakistani national, serving life sentences in a 2012 terror conspiracy case involving Lashkar.

The young woman's death sparked outrage across the country and led to the enactment of Commission of Sati (Prevention) Act, 1987, which made even glorification of the practice a punishable offence.A year later, on Sept 22, 1988, police intercepted a truck ferrying 45 people from Deorala to Ajitgarh, also in Sikar district. They were shouting ""Sati mata ki jai"", which amounted to glorification of the banned practice. Under Section 5 of the legislation, anyone held guilty of glorifying sati is liable for a jail term of not less than a year, which may extend to seven years, along with a fine ranging between Rs 5,000 and Rs 30,000.In 1996, all 32 accused in the main Roop Kanwar case, charged with her murder in name of sati, were acquitted due to insufficient evidence.","Roop Kanwar, 18, died after allegedly being forced to die on her husband's pyre in 1987.

We will increase our lead,” NC vice-president Omar Abdullah said Wednesday.NC, with 42 seats, emerged as the single largest party. Congress won six, and CPM 1, taking the alliance tally to 49. With the backing of six independents, NC’s numbers would rise to 48 — the figure required for a comfortable majority in assembly on its own.This development comes amid shifting political dynamics in the Union territory. Omar, set to become the next chief minister, acknowledged Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s congratulatory message and sought cordial relations with BJP-led central govt. He also advised ally Congress to introspect on its loss to BJP in Haryana.Elections in Jammu & Kashmir were held for 90 seats, but the assembly’s total strength will be 95, with five MLAs to be nominated by the lieutenant governor. BJP secured 29 seats, all from Jammu region.Omar said NC would challenge the nomination of MLAs in Supreme Court. “You will only nominate five MLAs to sit in the opposition, and there will be a row because we will then have to approach SC and file a case against it… The nomination of five MLAs will not have any impact on govt formation… BJP will not gain anything by nominating these five MLAs,” he said.Sources said the independent MLAs likely to support NC include Jammu region’s Choudhary Mohammad Akram (Surankote), Muzaffar Iqbal Khan (Thanamandi), Payare Lal Sharma (Inderwal), and Dr Rameshwar Singh (Bani), and Khursheed Ahmed Sheikh (Langate) and Shabir Ahmed Kullay (Shopian) from Kashmir Valley.Akram, a long-time NC loyalist, ran as an independent after Surankote went to Congress under the seat-sharing arrangement. He defeated Congress’s Mohammad Shahnawaz.Iqbal, who won from Thanamandi, had been promised an NC ticket but was forced to run as an independent.

Congress bent on dividing Hindu society on caste lines: PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-bent-on-dividing-hindu-society-on-caste-lines-pm-modi/articleshow/114097377.cms,"NAGPUR/NEW DELHI: A day after BJP 's win in Haryana, PM Narendra Modi on Wednesday doubled down his attack on Congress for trying to divide Hindu society for its partisan ends and said the opposition, which consistently talks about castes among Hindus, never talks about castes among Muslims, potentially setting the tone for the campaign for the coming contest in Maharashtra.""They (Congress) never discuss caste within the Muslim community, but when it comes to Hindus, they rake up caste issues to divide us,"" the PM said while virtually inaugurating projects worth more than Rs 7,000 crore for poll-bound Maharashra.""Congress's formula is simple: keep Muslims under fear, turn them into a vote bank, and stoke divisions in Hindu society to benefit electorally,"" he said. He termed the party's tactics a betrayal of national unity .While the accusation that Congress had been seeking to split Hindu society for political gains is not new, it is perhaps the first time that Modi had accused the opposition party of keeping mum on castes among Muslims. Significantly, the PM had spoken about the backwardness of Pasmandas, the OBC among Muslims.Modi said Congress wants to keep Hindu society simmering by any means to make political gains. “Wherever elections take place , Congress uses the same formula — to secure its vote bank, sow seeds of division. Congress fights elections purely on the basis of communalism, casteism, and dividing Hindu society,” he said and appealed to people to vote for Mahayuti alliance comprising BJP, Sena (Shinde) and NCP led by Ajit Pawar.This was the third time in last 10 days PM attacked Congress for seeking to split Hindus along castes. Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat have also raised the issue, though the latter did not mention Congress.He said entire ecosystem of Congress and the entire gang of urban Naxals were busy misleading public, but all the conspiracies of Congress have been ruined.Referring to BJP’s s record-shattering victory in Haryana, Modi said falsehoods spread by Congress have been exposed. He expressed optimism about BJP’s prospects in ensuing contests. “Just yesterday, election results of Haryana and J&K were declared. Haryana has told what the mood of the country is. It is historic to be elected for the third consecutive time .”Emphasising farmers of Haryana are happy with welfare schemes introduced by BJP govt, Modi said, “Dalit community of Haryana has given record support to BJP.

The unilateral move drew protest from Avinash Pande, Congress secretary in-charge of UP. Congress had refused to share seats with SP in Haryana.It soon became open season on the largest opposition party with even National Conference leader Omar Abdullah saying, “Congress will have to go deep into it and find the reasons for its defeat (in Haryana). Abdullah, who won the J&K polls in alliance with Congress, said, “My job is to run the NC and help the alliance here, which I will.”Left parties and TMC further twisted the knife by saying Congress should learn not to ignore its allies.Shiv Sena (UBT) was the harshest as it virtually accused Congress of being opportunist in its dealings with partners. “Congress relied on allies in weak regions but ignored them where it was strong,” its spokesperson Sanjay Raut wrote in party mouthpiece Saamna. “In Haryana, the INDIA bloc couldn’t form the govt because Congress thought that it could win alone,” he added.“If SP, AAP and parties like ours would have joined them, the result would have been different,” Raut said. The allies won in J&K as Omar Abdullah was the face of the opposition, Raut said.Reiterating the demand to declare the CM face (read Uddhav Thackeray) for Maharashtra elections , Raut said, “In a state like Maharashtra, people want a leader. People cannot digest the policy that you first contest polls and declare the CM's face later.”Maharashtra Congress president Nana Patole slammed Raut for his comments and said accusations against the party won't be tolerated. “The political situation in Haryana and Maharashtra is different. Congress fights elections alongside its allies, as was seen in the Lok Sabha elections,"" he said.JMM, which will contest the Jharkhand polls with Congress, advised the party to “come down from its high pedestal” and give due importance to regional parties . Maintaining that the results were not very surprising, party general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya said, “It is a repeat of what happened in Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh and Congress must learn to give importance to its partners.”Trinamool Congress minced no words in driving home the point. “Arrogance, entitlement and looking down on regional parties is a recipe for disaster,"" party MP Saket Gokhale said on X.“Congress lost again when it was a straight fight between it and BJP. Regional parties do much better in defeating BJP. TMC is the only party in the INDIA bloc who does not have an electoral understanding with Congress. All others do. The question: will Congress ever shed its big brother attitude?” another senior party leader said.Former Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal had questioned Congress’s poll strategy in Haryana. The party announced on Wednesday that it would fight the Delhi assembly polls on its own.RJD too called on Congress to ""introspect (and) focus on accommodative politics"". “Alliance principles should be respected. Big parties should respect regional parties... everyone has to make sacrifices,"" a party leader said.CPM urged secular forces to unite and asked Congress to “introspect” on its strategy in the aftermath of the “unexpected setback” it faced in Haryana.CPI general secretary D Raja too said Congress needed to introspect over the poll results in Haryana and take along all INDIA bloc partners in the upcoming polls in Maharashtra and Jharkhand."," INDIA bloc parties came out against it for ""ignoring allies"" and blamed its ""arrogance and overconfidence"" for the debacle.

Jammu & Kashmir results a victory for democracy; Haryana a befitting reply to Congress' lies: PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jammu-kashmir-results-a-victory-for-democracy-haryana-a-befitting-reply-to-congress-lies-pm-modi/articleshow/114058111.cms,"NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Tuesday launched a scathing attack on Congress and its “cronies”, accusing them of joining an international conspiracy to defame and destabilise the country and create social divisions, while following the “politics of falsehoods”.“For some time now, conspiracies are being hatched to weaken India’s democracy and social fabric.International conspiracies are being hatched. National parties like Congress and their cronies (chatte-batte) are involved in this game. Today, Haryana has given a befitting reply to every such conspiracy,” the PM said while he made a veiled reference of Rahul Gandhi, as someone born not with a silver but gold spoon being involved in the conspiracy.“Congress wants to build a nation where people hate its culture, don’t trust its institutions. Whether it is the Election Commission, defence forces, police or judiciary, Congress is trying to tarnish every institution. Till the Lok Sabha results came, they created a ruckus and even during elections , they along with allies and urban Naxal friends went up to the Supreme Court to raise doubts over the conduct of EC. Even today, Congress sought to mislead the people. Every time, they try to raise doubts over the objectivity of our institutions. It is their habit. Congress shamelessly has been doing this,” he said after the party’s historic third consecutive term in Haryana.Modi said the mandate was a befitting reply to Congress, describing it as a party that was against Dalits, OBCs and tribals.He said its leaders saw power as their birth right and behaved like a fish out of water when not in govt. “Desperate to return, they’ve resorted to spreading divisive caste politics, pitting the poor against each other. In Haryana, Congress rejected Dalit and OBC participation and openly threatened to end reservations. Their game is clear: trade the rights of the marginalised for votes,” he said.Modi said Congress aimed to weaken India by sowing discord among its people, inciting farmers and Dalits against the BJP. “Attempts to undermine our Army and youth have also failed, as Haryana’s youth rejected these divisive tactics. The message is clear: anti-national politics will not prevail. Despite ongoing conspiracies against India’s democracy, economy and social fabric, Haryana has responded decisively,” he said.He described Congress as a “parasite party”, which he said was further established after the poll verdicts in Haryana and J&K. “In the Lok Sabha polls too, most of Congress's wins came due to allies. Wherever allies trusted Congress, they sank. Congress has now become a liability, dragging down its own partners,” he said. Without naming National Conference, he added that in J&K, Congress’s partner feared it would lose seats due to the alliance. Modi said that across states, voters had rejected a second term for Congress with the last time this happened being in 2011 in Assam. In contrast, BJP had won consecutive terms in Gujarat, MP, UP and Uttarakhand with Haryana also on the list.Asserting that the unprecedented mandate will echo far and wide, the PM said, “In Haryana, development has triumphed over lies. This marks a new chapter in Haryana's political history.”Modi said after decades, J&K saw peaceful elections, with results marking a victory for India's Constitution and democracy. “While National Conference gained more seats, BJP emerged as the largest party by vote share,” he said as he extended congratulations to all winners.“Some said Kashmir would burn after Article 370’s removal, but instead, it blossomed. The massive voter turnout was heartening. For the first time, from MLAs to BDCs and DDCs, elected representatives are now shaping the future. We've restored the true spirit of the Constitution in J&K — what better tribute to Dr Babasahab Ambedkar than this?” he asked.Modi said the Haryana verdict would give a boost to efforts being taken to make India a developed country. He said farmers, youth, women and poor were the pillars of development in the country.","PM Narendra Modi accuses Congress of joining an international conspiracy to defame and destabilise the country.

The party on Tuesday took the unprecedented step of declaring that it will not accept the verdict, alleging there was a “conspiracy” hatched through “manipulation” of EVMs.In a sharp reply, the EC wrote to Kharge saying: ""Such an unprecedented statement as above in a generic sense, unheard in the rich democratic heritage of the country, is far from a legitimate part of free speech & expression and moves towards an undemocratic rejection of the will of the people expressed in accordance with the Statutory and Regulatory electoral framework, uniformly applied across all elections in the country including J&K and Haryana.""Noting the statements of Kharge and Rahul Gandhi who mentioned that the Congress has proposed to analyse the and approach the EC with its complaints/grievances, the poll panel said it will meet the party delegation of 12 members, including Jairam Ramesh and Pawan Khera, at 6 pm on Wednesday to address the issues.In Haryana elections , the results of which were announced on Tuesday, Congress lost the plot to BJP by getting only 37 of 90 assembly seats. BJP, on the other hand, managed to fight anti-incumbency and secured historic third term in the state with 48 seats.Congress, however, made an unprecedented move by rejecting the election mandate, claiming that the EVMs were tampered with. This marks the first instance of a major political party in India refusing to accept the election results on such grounds. The allegation was made amidst internal turmoil within the party's Haryana unit, where senior leaders Kumari Selja and Bhupinder Singh Hooda acknowledged their defeat.Selja pointed fingers at the Hooda faction for the party's poor performance in the state. Meanwhile, Hooda stated that he would accept the results ""under protest,"" expressing his astonishment at the outcome. The Congress party's stance has raised eyebrows and sparked a debate about the credibility of the electoral process in India.","The Election Commission of India (EC) on Wednesday wrote a strong-worded letter to Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge.
