The impact was so severe that Kaveri was thrown onto the car's bonnet, and the driver fled the scene after continuing to drive for about 100 meters.Speaking about the incident, Maharashtra chief minister Eknath Shinde assured that the law is equal for everyone and that the police will not shield anyone in this case. Asked if the man involved in the Mumbai accident was a Shiv Sena leader's son, the CM just said, ""The law is equal for all and the government sees every case in the same way. There will be no separate rule for this accident. Everything will be done as per the law.""Aaditya Thackeray also visited the Worli Police Station and met with senior police officers investigating the case.

Hopefully there will be no political refuge by the regime,"" Thackeray said.This incident comes less than two months after a similar case in Pune, where two IT professionals were killed by a Porsche allegedly driven by an inebriated minor. The case garnered national attention due to the lenient bail terms granted to the accused and the alleged efforts by the accused's parents and doctors to tamper with evidence.","Mumbai Police detained Eknath Shinde faction's Shiv Sena leader Rajesh Shah after his son's speeding BMW rammed into a two-wheeler killing a woman.

Ex-BRS MP's exit from Rajya Sabha raises Cong chance to take its tally to 27,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ex-brs-mps-exit-from-rajya-sabha-raises-cong-chance-to-take-its-tally-to-27/articleshow/111560419.cms,"NEW DELHI: Keshav Rao's resignation from Rajya Sabha as a BRS MP and Congress's expected win of the vacancy in the byelection will take the party's tally in the upper House to 27, increasing its cushion to retain the leader of opposition 's post to two seats and relieving it of a serious concern. Telangana has a large Congress majority and it is sure to win the seat.After its debacle in the December 2023 state elections and its setbacks post-2014, Congress's tally in the upper House has slipped drastically. After the last round of Rajya Sabha elections, Congress barely retained the leader of opposition's post, which is occupied by party president Mallikarjun Kharge.The party's strength in Rajya Sabha till the 2024 Lok Sabha elections stood at 28, while the 10% seats that enable the principal opposition party to claim the LoP position is 25.As the party appeared to have barely retained the requisite numbers, the parliamentary elections saw the victory of two Rajya Sabha members - K C Venugopal and Deepender Hooda - and their resignations from the RS has brought down the Congress tally to 26.The biggest concern over this change was its implication for the key perch that allows the Congress president to have a leadership role in Parliament. A buffer of one seat appeared very shaky. At the same time, the byelections to be called on the seats vacated by Venugopal and Hooda will benefit BJP which governs Rajasthan and Haryana.It is here that Rao's crossing over to his erstwhile party will increase the Congress comfort over the LoP's position.While Rao may return to the RS from Telangana for the remainder term of two years as a Congress member, his appointment in Hyderabad as adviser to the state govt on Sunday has led to talk that he may be replaced by Abhishek Singhvi.A political veteran, Rao was Andhra Pradesh Congress president and later became a senior leader in Telangana Congress. He was also a CWC member in charge of the state. However, Rao ditched Congress in 2013 and moved to the then TRS.","Keshav Rao's resignation from Rajya Sabha as a BRS MP will take the party's tally in the upper House to 27.

‘No action initiated against Kolkata CP on governor’s complaint’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-mha-action-initiated-against-kolkata-dc-on-governors-complaint/articleshow/111560390.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amid media reports that the home ministry had started disciplinary proceedings against Kolkata police commissioner Vineet Goyal and DCP Indira Mukherjee for alleged misconduct, MHA sources said the Centre could not initiate action unilaterally against IPS officers serving in a state as the disciplinary authority competent to do so was the CM of the state concerned, as per rules governing All-India Services, including IPS.Sources said while the home ministry has received a complaint from West Bengal governor C V Ananda Bose alleging that Kolkata police commissioner Vineet Goyal and deputy commissioner of police (DCP), Central, Indira Mukherjee had engaged in misconduct and were functioning in a manner ""unbecoming"" of members of all-India services, it has not yet moved forward on it. ""No disciplinary proceedings have been initiated,"" a home ministry officer told TOI.As per All-India Services (Conduct) Rules, 1968, and All-India Services (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1969, the disciplinary authority for a member of All-India Services including IPS who is serving under the state govt is the state govt itself. MHA, being the cadre-controlling authority, can request a state govt, in case a complaint of misconduct is received against IPS officers, to initiate disciplinary proceedings as per service rules. The state govt may refuse to do so, denying outright any misconduct on part of the said officer, or go through with the disciplinary proceedings, which may end in the officer's exoneration. The MHA may also summon the officer serving in a state for an explanation or even recall him/her to the Centre, but for both these actions the state must give permission or relieve the said officer.In the past few years, there have been cases where the Centre has sought disciplinary action against officers serving in West Bengal after finding their conduct to be in violation of service rules. Two such officers were then West Bengal chief secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay, an IAS officer who was recalled to the Centre in 2021 after he failed to attend a review meeting on Cyclone Yaas taken by PM Narendra Modi, and then Kolkata police commissioner Rajeev Kumar against whom MHA sought disciplinary proceedings in 2019 for sitting on a dharna alongside CM Mamata Banerjee.However, no harm came to either officer as the state govt stood firmly by them. Bandyopadhyay was never relieved by the West Bengal govt even after being recalled. Kumar, considered close to Banerjee, went on to become DGP of West Bengal; in fact, the EC had removed him from the DGP's post during the recent Lok Sabha polls, keeping in mind his proximity to the CM, which it saw as an impediment to free and fair elections in the state.Given the background, the MHA may be contemplating its limited options vis-a-vis action on Bengal governor's complaint against Goyal and Mukherjee.","The home ministry has received a complaint from West Bengal governor C V Ananda Bose alleging that Kolkata police commissioner Vineet Goyal and deputy commissioner of police (DCP), Central, Indira Mukherjee had engaged in misconduct.

The saffron party expelled Mandu MLA Jaiprakash Bhai Patel after he joined Congress to contest the polls.The current strength of the 81-member Jharkhand assembly is 76.The ruling alliance had handed over a support list of 44 MLAs to the Governor when Hemant Soren staked his claim to form the government on July 3.","JMM, Congress, and RJD legislators exuded confidence in securing a successful outcome in the trust vote.

Sikh: Haryana Sikh community demand to hold HSGMC elections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/haryana-sikh-community-demand-to-hold-hsgmc-elections/articleshow/111558842.cms,"AMBALA:

A group of Haryana Sikh community members led by Didar Singh Nalvi, former vice-president of Haryana Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (HSGMC), demanded from Haryana chief minister (CM) Nayab Singh Saini to hold HSGMC elections prior to state assembly elections.A memorandum has been signed and sent under the banner of Sikh Samaj Sanstha, in the name of Haryana CM .This Sikh group held its meeting at Gurdwara Panjokhra Sahib in Ambala district on Sunday.It has been said that the tenure of the government-nominated house of HSGMC has expired on May 31, 2024, the lapsed committee is still functioning and spending daily lakhs of rupees from the Guru’s golak (offering box) which is very much in knowledge of the present government. They said the government should step in and immediately stop the “ghost committee” to spend the money from Gurdwara funds.“It is also a fact that presently there is no official body to run Gurdwara affairs, yet the old body is functioning without any extension, which is absolutely illegal”, said the memorandum.Sikh Samaj Sanstha said the Haryana Gurdwara Election Commissioner had completed its whole exercise of holding the HSGMC elections and even had announced March 7, 2024 as election date, but it had to be postponed due to Haryana school board exams and Parliamentary elections.“Now, as the Parliamentary elections are held, it is the duty of the government to hold Gurdwara elections immediately. So as to stall Gurdwara elections, the government of Haryana has decided to hold, first the Municipal polls and then the assembly elections, which is tantamount to denial of electoral rights to the Sikhs of Haryana to manage their holy shrines”, they said.The Sikh group prayed that Haryana Gurdwara elections may be held before Haryana municipal polls and state assembly elections.Didar Singh Nalvi said, “Holding the Gurdwara elections is the constitutional duty of the government and it should be done without delay like state and Parliamentary elections.

Gujarati-origin woman scripts Tories’ only gain; Shivani Raja broke Labour’s grip on Leicester East,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/gujarati-origin-woman-scripts-tories-only-gain/articleshow/111560030.cms,"TOI

LONDON: There was a silver lining on an otherwise dark night for the Tories on Thursday. Gujarati-origin businesswoman Shivani Raja (29) won Leicester East -- the only Conservative gain of the night. Raja won with 14,526 votes, beating Labour ’s Rajesh Agrawal, former deputy mayor of London who came second with 10,100.Leicester East had been held by Labour since 1987.The area was rocked by riots in 2022, something Raja referred to after her triumph.Padma Shri awardee and Conservative MP Bob Blackman bucked the national trend and increased his majority in Harrow East from 8,170 to 11,860, beating his Indian-origin Labour opponent Primesh Patel. Harrow East has a large Indian diaspora, especially from Gujarat and south India. Many of them helped with Blackman’s campaign. Blackman now plans to throw his hat in the ring to be the chairman of the 1922 committee, the committee of backbench Tory MPs which organises the process to choose the next Conservative party leader.Raja was born in Leicester. Her mother moved to the UK from Rajkot and her father, a Gujarati, moved from Kenya in the 1970s. She works in the family property construction and hospitality business. Raja toldthat voters felt very disenfranchised and backed her as she was local, unlike some other candidates who had been “parachuted in”.“They had lost faith in politicians as previous MPs had not really stood for the people. There was no one standing that was relatable and people saw me as a breath of fresh air. They were also disappointed that the previous MP did not stand up for Leicester during the riots and immediately blamed Hindus before speaking to anyone,” Raja said.Keith Vaz first won Leicester East in 1987. Claudia Webbe, who won the seat in 2019 for Labour but then got expelled from the party over a criminal conviction and stood as an independent, got 5,532 votes. Vaz, who stood for One Leicester, got 3,681 votes.As for Blackman, he has the task cut for him. If elected as chairman of the 1922 committee, he will organise the leadership contest to replace Rishi Sunak, who bowed out as PM after last week’s election results.The panel’s former chairman, Graham Brady, stood down at this election. Blackman told the Daily Telegraph: “I’ve been around since 1992. I’ve been through all the seminal events with Theresa May, Boris, Liz Truss and the election of Rishi.” He said the Conservatives needed a “chairman with the authority to be able to get the party together to be able to hear every view.”Co-chair of Conservative Friends of India Ameet Jogia, a former No.10 political advisor and political aide to Lord Popat, failed to win Hendon by just 15 seats — the lowest margin in the country. He is now taking legal advice about launching a possible judicial review against Barnet council for not sending postal ballots to people on time.Had Jogia, a Harrow-born Girnari Soni whose parents moved to the UK from Tanzania, been elected, he would have become the first member of the Soni community in the House of Commons. Thousands of voters in 120 constituencies are thought to have been impacted by delayed and missing postal ballots. Jogia told The Telegraph he personally knows constituents would have voted for him but their postal votes never arrived. “In my case this would have made a difference.”","Gujarati-origin businesswoman Shivani Raja (29) won Leicester East -- the only Conservative gain of the night.
