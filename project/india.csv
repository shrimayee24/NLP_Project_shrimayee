NEW DELHI: Taking exception to Bengal govt’s decision to unilaterally exonerate Baruipur Purba assembly constituency assistant electoral registration officer (AERO) Tathagata Mondal and impose only a minor penalty against Moyna AC AERO Sudipta Das — despite clear instructions by Election Commission (dated 05.08.2025) to suspend and initiate disciplinary proceedings against them — EC Wednesday asked the state chief secretary to get the competent authority to submit to the commission a written explanation for the “procedural lapse”.The explanation — sought by 5pm on Jan 24 — must detail the circumstances that led to non-compliance with the commission’s instructions, which had mandated that disciplinary authorities shall consult EC before closing or finalising any matter arising out of disciplinary proceedings initiated on the poll panel’s recommendation.“Since the disciplinary proceedings have been finalised without adherence to the prescribed procedure and without mandatory consultation with the Commission, the Commission does not accept such finalisation of disciplinary action. Accordingly, the same shall be treated as procedurally irregular and non est in the eyes of the Commission, warranting reconsideration,” EC said in the letter sent to the state chief secretary.As part of the explanation sought by EC, the competent authority has been asked to furnish the complete disciplinary case records, including the articles of charge, written statements of defence, inquiry reports, findings of the inquiry authority, orders of the disciplinary authority, file notings and all other relevant records forming the basis of the disciplinary action taken in respect of four officials, namely Tathagata Mondal, Debottam Dutta Choudhury, Biplab Sarkar and Sudipta Das.The commission had directed the state govt to suspend and initiate suitable disciplinary proceedings against the EROs/AEROs concerned and lodge FIRs against the erring officials, including the contractual data entry operator, under Section 32 of the RP Act, 1950, read with the relevant provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, and Information Technology Act, 2000.

NEW DELHI: In his maiden address after taking over as BJP national president, Nitin Nabin on Tuesday asked party workers to mount a fight to “protect” the centres and legacy of Sanatan faith, saying political parties opposed to ‘deepam’ tradition in Madurai or existence of Ram Setu should have no space in politics.Nabin, whose elevation at 45 years of age is being seen as a generational shift in BJP, called Prime Minister Narendra Modi an inspiration and urged the youth to heed his call for joining active politics by saying “keeping a distance is no solution”. Youth should treat politics as a marathon and not a 100-metre sprint and prioritise stamina over speed, he said, adding that BJP’s “watch tower” is vigilant enough to identify their talent.Nabin’s unopposed election as the 12th BJP president was announced at a function at the party headquarters in New Delhi in the presence of PM Modi and several former party chiefs, including JP Nadda, Amit Shah, Rajnath Singh and Nitin Gadkari.Shah congratulated Nabin, expressing confidence that his tenure as BJP president under Modi’s guidance will infuse new energy and speed in the party’s dedicated work towards national interest and people’s welfare.The fifth-term MLA and first person from Bihar to head BJP’s organisation ticked off the party’s twin planks of Hindutva and nationalism in his inaugural address, which will be pored over by its rank and file, a large number of whom might not have heard much of him before he was appointed BJP working president last month. DMK ’s strident opposition to bid by Hindu groups to light a ‘deepam’ at a hilltop considered sacred by them was seized by BJP to mount a political challenge as the state heads to assembly polls.Nabin also flagged the decision by DMK and its allies to move a motion for removal of Madras high court Judge GR Swaminathan, who had decided in favour of Hindu groups, to target the parties. A division bench had later rejected state govt’s challenge to the verdict. He also voiced the party’s concerns over infiltration, which is a key part of its agenda in poll-bound Bengal and Assam.","Nitin Nabin, 45, is the 12th BJP president.
