NEW DELHI: Stating that claims about USAID funds to India have proved to be false, Congress on Sunday accused BJP of indulging in ""anti-national work"" by spreading ""fake news from America"". It said while BJP is actively involved in using fake news to defame Congress and the opposition, it is silent on insults being heaped upon India by US president Donald Trump and Elon Musk to secure pardon for Adani, who is facing cases in America.Congress spokesman Jairam Ramesh called ""BJP a procession of liars and illiterates"", as he reiterated what has become public - that $21 million that Trump and Musk claimed were for voter turnout for India, were actually for Bangladesh. He said Musk made a false claim and Trump was confused between Dhaka and Delhi but BJP spread the lie further, which was seized upon by ""BJP's bootlickers"".""Now, BJP should answer this: Why did BJP spread fake news about India's democracy? Why did BJP do anti-national activity by spreading fake news from America? Is BJP's accusation against India's opposition party using fake news from America not treason?"" he asked.Ramesh said PM Narendra Modi and external affairs minister S Jaishankar must answer why are they silent to repeated insults heaped upon India by Trump and Musk. ""Is the country's self-respect being compromised to beg for mercy for Adani?"" he asked.","Congress spokesman Jairam Ramesh called ""BJP a procession of liars and illiterates"" He reiterated what has become public - that $21 million that Trump and Musk claimed were for voter turnout for India, were actually for Bangladesh.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118512159,imgsize-1383202,width-400,resizemode-4/118512159.jpg"

Niko Graft Case: Clean slate for Khaleda Zia as she is acquitted in her last graft case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/clean-slate-for-khaleda-as-she-is-acquitted-in-her-last-graft-case/articleshow/118399492.cms,"Continuing the stream of relief granted to Khaleda Zia since the govt change in Bangladesh, a Dhaka court on Wednesday acquitted the BNP chairperson , along with seven others, in the Niko graft case filed by the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) in 2007.With this verdict, Khaleda has now been acquitted of all corruption cases filed against her, including those related to the Zia Orphanage Trust and Zia Charitable Trust, during the caretaker govt in 2007 and the subsequent Awami League-led govt. Notably, all the acquittals were made after Muhammad Yunus took charge of the interim govt after Sheikh Hasina's govt was overthrown by violent student-led protests.The verdict also clears her path to enter elections, likely in Dec, with a clean slate. She is in London for medical treatment.Judge Md Rabiul Alam delivered the ruling, stating that the prosecution failed to prove the charges against Khaleda and the other accused; hence, all were acquitted. The ACC originally filed the case on Dec 9, 2007, alleging that Khaleda and others had abused their power to grant Niko, a Canadian oil and gas exploration company, an illegal deal while she was PM from 2001 to 2006. Charges were officially pressed on May 5, 2008, against Khaleda and 10 others.","Khaleda Zia has now been acquitted of all corruption cases filed against her, including those related to the Zia Orphanage Trust and Zia Charitable Trust.
