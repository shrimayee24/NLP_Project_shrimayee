KOLKATA: CBI filed Wednesday an appeal in Calcutta high court seeking death penalty for Sanjay Roy, convicted and sentenced Monday to life imprisonment for raping and murdering a 31-year-old resident doctor at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on Aug 9 last year.The appeal, submitted before a division bench, also challenges the maintainability of a similar plea filed by Bengal govt Tuesday. The state had sought capital punishment for Roy after CM Mamata Banerjee expressed dissatisfaction with sessions court’s decision to spare Roy the gallows. The matter has been listed for hearing on Jan 27.CBI counsel Rajdeep Majumder argued that the state was not authorised to file appeals in cases investigated by central agencies, asserting that Union govt is the only competent authority to do so.Bengal advocate general Kishore Datta countered that the case was initially investigated by Kolkata police before being handed over to CBI, making the state’s appeal admissible.The trial court’s 172-page judgment indicates that CBI’s probe into the case is still ongoing. Judge Anirban Das said in his order: “In this case, a chargesheet was submitted only for the offence of rape and murder of the victim, and the actual offender was placed before this court for trial. It does not mean that the entire investigation process came to an end.”",CBI files appeal in Calcutta high court seeking death penalty for Sanjay Roy.

After a few months, five MLAs of JDU defected to BJP. Trial under the 10th Schedule of the Constitution of India of the five MLAs is pending before the Speaker’s Tribunal. After JDU became a part of the INDIA bloc, support to the BJP-led govt was withdrawn by the party by informing the office of the governor, leader of the House (CM) and speaker,” the letter read.“As such, the seating arrangement of the lone MLA of JDU in Manipur, Mohd Abdul Nasir, was made in the opposition bench in the last session of the assembly by the speaker. It is, hereby, further reiterated that JDU’s Manipur unit does not support the BJP-led state govt, and our lone MLA, Abdul Nasir, shall be treated as an opposition MLA in the House,” Singh said in his letter.BJP has 37 legislators in the 60-member Manipur assembly, besides the support of five Naga People’s Front MLAs and three independents.","JDU sacked its Manipur unit president Kshetrimayum Biren Singh on Wednesday.
