Rs 4.8 crore plot for Maharashtra BJP chief’s trust stirs row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rs-4-8-crore-plot-for-maharashtra-bjp-chiefs-trust-stirs-row/articleshow/113683293.cms,"State BJP chief Chandrashekhar Bawankule

MUMBAI: A political storm has erupted over Maharashtra cabinet’s decision to directly allot 5 hectares of land in Nagpur’s Koradi area for educational purposes to a trust headed by state BJP chief Chandrashekhar Bawankule , overriding objections raised by finance and revenue departments.The land allotted to Shri Mahalakshmi Jagdamba Sansthan is worth Rs 4.8 crore, according to state govt’s Ready Reckoner (RR) rate.The finance department had pointed out the trust did not qualify for direct allotment because it nei ther has “long experience” in the field of higher and technical education nor is it a renowned institution.Sources said the proposal for the direct allotmentwas not on the agenda and was presented at the last minute in Monday’s cabinet meeting. It was passed without any discussion or a prior note being circulated to explain the proposal.“Mahayuti govt has distributed Rs 5 lakh crore of public land. Prime land is being given at 25% of the RR rate,” alleged Congress functionary Vijay Wadettiwar.“When MVA govt comes to power in two months, we will probe such cases,” said NCP (Sharad Pawar group) functionary Anil Deshmukh. “From Vinoba Bhave’s slogan that all land belongs to Govinda, BJP’s slogan is all land belongs to Devabhau [Deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis] and he will distribute it to whoever he wants,” alleged Shiv Sena (UBT) ‘s Sanjay Raut.Bawankule, however, was combative. “This is not my trust. I am just the president and the person holding the post changes every two years. There should be no politics around a devasthan (religious institution),” he said. Revenue minister Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil from BJP said, “The department has supported the allotment.”On Nov 29, 2023, Shri Mahalakshmi Jagdamba Sansthan had applied for direct allotment of the land to set up a junior college, science-arts-commerce college, nursing college, and skill development centres.","The land allotted to Shri Mahalakshmi Jagdamba Sansthan is worth Rs 4.8 crore, according to state govt’s Ready Reckoner (RR) rate.

Kerala probes senior cop’s meet with RSS netas,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kerala-probes-senior-cops-meet-with-rss-netas/articleshow/113683265.cms,"ADGP (law & order) MR Ajith Kumar (File photo)

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM/ KOZHIKODE: Kerala government has initiated an inquiry into alleged meetings ADGP (law & order) MR Ajith Kumar had with two high-ranking RSS functionaries last year. The move comes after political pressure, with opposition and leaders of LDF ally CPI — including its national secretary D Raja — seeking a probe into these allegations.State police chief Shaik Darvesh Saheb, who has been asked to conduct the probe, is already inquiring into various serious allegations — including links to gold smuggling rackets, role in mur ders, and corruption — raised against Ajith Kumar by CPM-backed independent MLA PV Anvar.It was opposition leader VD Satheesan who first alleged that Ajith Kumar had met RSS general secretary Dattatreya Hosabale in Thris sur in May last year at Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan ’s behest, following which ADGP himself admitted it. It was reported later that ADGP had also met another top RSS functionary, Ram Madhav, at a hotel in Kovalam. The meetings reportedly happened during events organised by RSS.The probe is aimed at gathering statements from those who attended these meetings, for which notices have been issued to some RSS functionaries. CPM, however, had sought to downplay the meetings, terming them as personal. After some LDF allies raised these issues at a recent front meeting, Vijayan had assured them that all charges raised against the police officer would be probed.Meanwhile, Congress termed the probe a “farce.” AICC general secretary KC Venugopal said CPM and Kerala govt have something to hide regarding ADGP-RSS functionaries meeting and that there is a lack of transparency in govt’s actions. He criticised the CPM top brass for remaining silent, calling it unfortunate.Satheesan alleged as the CM’s emissary, Ajith Kumar had proposed to RSS functionary that they could help BJP win the Thrissur Lok Sabha seat and in return RSS should ensure that they should not be trouble in any manner.","Kerala government has initiated an inquiry into alleged meetings ADGP (law & order) MR Ajith Kumar had with two high-ranking RSS functionaries last year.

Congress return will bring back scams: PM’s dig at Gandhis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-return-will-bring-back-scams-pms-dig-at-gandhis/articleshow/113683089.cms,"PM Modi

CHANDIGARH/NEW DELHI: PM Modi brought land scams allegedly involving Robert Vadra and former CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda centrestage as he cautioned voters of Haryana that Congress ’s return would bring back scams of “kharchi-parchi sarkar”, a term BJP also used in its manifesto to target the rival over allegations of corruption and land scams during its term.“In Haryana, farmers’ land was looted, and the state was handed over to ‘dalals’ (middlemen) and ‘daamad’ (son-in-law),” Modi said referring to land deals during Hooda’s term as CM in which Vadra, husband of Congress general secretary Priyanka Vadra, is an accused.Addressing his second poll meeting in Haryana, in Gohana in Sonipat district, PM Modi challenged Congress’s sincerity in making generous promises to farmers, saying the party had not implemented those promises in states where it was in office.Targeting the Gandhi family, PM Modi said this “royal family” of Congress was the most corrupt family in the country, and when the high command was corrupt, it gave a free licence for looting at the lower levels. The PM also attacked Congress over “internal feud” in the party, widely seen as a reference to former Union minister Kumari Selja’s sulk over the prominence bestowed on Hooda, her factional rival, and cautioned voters that similar intra-party feuds had paralysed Congress govts in Rajasthan and Karnataka.PM Modi said voting for Congress would mean putting Haryana’s development at risk. He also said if Congress came to office, no new investor would come to Haryana, and there would be no jobs for youngsters in the state.The rally at Gohana saw a large crowd, leading Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan to attribute the turnout to the PM’s appeal.Slamming Congress for its “anti-reservation stance,” the PM said opposing quota was in the party’s DNA and emphasised that BJP had uplifted marginalised and backward communities in Haryana. He said BJP appointed Nayab Saini, a member of OBC community and the son of a farmer-labourer, as CM.He assured that if BJP returned to office in the state, new job opportunities would be created for the youth. He highlighted the potential of the Sonipat-Panipat belt, which he said was brimming with opportunities.","PM Modi warns voters of Haryana that Congress’s return would bring back scams of ‘kharchi-parchi sarkar’ Modi: ‘Farmers’ land was looted, and the state was handed over to middlemen’","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113683084,imgsize-610428,width-400,resizemode-4/113683084.jpg"

I was sexually abused by IIC, others at Bharatpur police station: Army officer's fiancee

An Army officer's fiance recounted being tortured and sexually abused by police at Bhubaneswar's Bharatpur station on Sept 15. She was arrested on charges of attacking a lady officer but claims she was framed. Five policemen, including the inspector-in-charge, are now under investigation by the crime branch.

BHUBANESWAR: A war of words between former Army chief General V K Singh and ex-CBI director Nageswara Rao over the Sept 15 incident has grabbed nationwide attention.Army veteran and former Union minister V K Singh shared a Sept 20 video of the woman recounting her traumatic experience on ‘X’ and termed the incident “shameful and horrendous”. He demanded swift action against the errant cops using the hashtag #ShameOnOdishaPolice.“The chief minister should take immediate action against the police personnel and all who are trying to shield the criminals in police uniform,” Singh’s post read.Replying to the post, former CBI director Rao, who had served for several years as an Odisha cadre IPS officer, attempted to shift the blame on the couple saying they were drunk and picked up a brawl with some engineering students on the road. Rao wrote that the couple, who went to Bharatpur police station to lodge a complaint against the students, created a ruckus inside the station.“When they were sent to hospital for medical examination and blood test, which is the standard protocol of investigation, they refused. Sir, we, the Indian Police, respect and honour our military because that is the last resort in defending the country from external enemies. A reciprocation from the military towards police which defends the country from internal enemies, is a normal expectation,” Rao replied.","Former Army chief Gen V K Singh and ex-CBI director M Nageswara Rao engaged in a social media spat over an alleged assault on a military captain and his fiance at Bharatpur police station in Bhubaneswar.

KAITHAL: Former chief minister and leader of opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda has said that BJP is suffering from anti-constitution and anti-reservation mindset and people have made up their mind to oust them from power.Campaigning for Congress candidate Devender Hans in Guhla Vidhan Sabha, Hooda attacked the BJP for alleging its efforts to end reservations and reducing access to education.“BJP has looted the reservation of Dalits and backward classes by ending permanent jobs and implementing Kaushal Nigam,” he said at the Dussehra ground at Siwan town.Similarly, by closing 5000 government schools and handing over the government education system to private hands, BJP has given the biggest blow to the reservation of the deprived classes. But now the time has come to curb this anti-constitutional policy of BJP. This time the public has made up its mind to oust BJP from power,” he added.""Hooda said that this fight to save the Constitution and reservation is not only political for us, but also personal because the constitution made by Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar, which gave reservation to Dalits and backward classes, also has the signature of my father Late Chaudhary Ranbir Singh Hooda. He had also worked as a member in the Constituent Assembly under the leadership of Baba Saheb. Therefore, we will not let the anti-constitution and anti-reservation plans of BJP succeed under any circumstances,” he stated.While appealing for votes for Devendra Hans, he said that you should send Devendra Hans to the Vidhan Sabha on my request, and I will form the Congress government as per your wish. Former CPS Dilluram Bajigar, former MLA Phool Singh Kheri, Anil Shorewala and Dilbagh Mor and other important leaders also addressed the rally.Hooda said that the BJP starts spreading lies as soon as it wakes up in the morning. “In Haryana, the BJP has not fulfilled even a single election promise till date. Whereas the Congress fulfils every promise it makes. That is why the state was number one in per capita income, investment, employment and sports under the Congress government, while the BJP has made the state number one in crime, unemployment and inflation today,” he said.“Every day news of ransom, robbery, murder and rape comes to the fore. According to the SPI report, Haryana has become the most unsafe state in the country. Even before the Congress government, gangs used to operate from jail, but as soon as we came to power, we warned the criminals to either leave crime or Haryana. Congress established rule of the law for ten years,” he stated.Hooda said the BJP has destroyed the employment generation eco-system in the state. “New factories are not coming up. Two lakh government sanctioned posts are lying vacant in the state. The situation of unemployment is such that our youth are forced to sell their lands and go to America through the Dunki route,” he said.“When the Congress government is formed, two lakh permanent recruitments will be done with merit, transparency and complete recruitment schedule. The seven guarantees given by the Congress will be fulfilled at all costs. The promises of Rs 6,000 old age pension, legal guarantee of MSP, 300 units of free electricity, gas cylinder for Rs 500, free plots and houses of 100 square yards, OBC creamy layer Rs 10 lakh and old pension scheme will be fulfilled at all costs,” he promised.Congress candidate Devendra Hans said that Bhupendra Singh Hooda and Deepender Singh Hooda have given the opportunity to become MLA to the son of a non-political and poor family. “Now it is our duty to send the Congress party to victory with a huge number of votes from Guhla,” he stated.",Former chief minister and leader of opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda has said that BJP is suffering from anti-constitution and anti-reservation mindset.

It was the first time the BJP came to power in J-K, but the alliance was marked by unease and the BJP pulled out in June 2018.Lambasting the BJP for its policies in the state, she dismissed its promise of appointing a chief minister from Jammu as ""hollow and misleading"".""Why isn't there a single advisor from Jammu? During our tenure, the DGP and Chief Secretary were from Jammu, but today, all these positions are held by outsiders,"" she questioned.Highlighting issues of unemployment, depression and drug use in Jammu and Kashmir, she also lashed out at the government's electricity policies and the allocation of contracts to ""outsiders"".Referring to the Congress-NC alliance, Mehbooba Mufti stated, ""When the National Congress entered into an alliance in 1987, Dr. Farooq Abdullah secured Congress's support. Even today, Congress remains under the influence of the National Conference.""She blamed the National Conference for the rise of terrorism, alleging electoral fraud in 1987 prevented the formation of an alternative government in Jammu and Kashmir which, she said, led the Kashmiri youths to take up arms.""To establish an alternative, Mufti Mohammad Sayeed founded the PDP,"" she said.","Mehbooba Mufti: Jammu and Kashmir will never have a BJP government. She said no ""secular government"" can be formed without the support of her party.
