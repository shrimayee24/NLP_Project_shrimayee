"Opposition resolves to keep collective focus on SIR in House, dubs it 'vote chori'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/opposition-resolves-to-keep-collective-focus-on-sir-in-house-dubs-it-vote-chori/articleshow/123031040.cms,"NEW DELHI: Deciding to call it ""vote chori"" for better political messaging, the opposition Thursday resolved to keep its collective focus on Special Intensive Review of electoral rolls during the remainder part of the monsoon session. After the discussion on the Pahalgam terror attack, it is set to demand one on SIR, a move that puts the functioning of Parliament in the coming weeks under a cloud given the government's reluctance on the sensitive issue targeted at BJP and Election Commission.At a discussion of the INDIA bloc leaders Thursday, the opposition agreed to keep their single-minded focus on the EC's electoral rolls review which has roiled election-bound Bihar, and would be implemented in the rest of the country. Rahul Gandhi is learnt to have led the discussion by alleging that the issues in Parliament are important, but the BJP is winning the elections by ""manipulating"" the voters' lists.The opposition's thinking was evident from the fact that the meeting also discussed the tariffs imposed by Donald Trump, with some dubbing them as a rebuff to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP. Congress Lok Sabha whip Manickam Tagore even moved an adjournment motion on the government's ""economic and diplomatic failure"" over tariffs.But the protest in the House which paralysed its functioning was solely on SIR.It was also mentioned in passing that Rahul make a presentation to the anti-BJP camp on how the ""tampering"" is being done, based on what Congress claims to have unearthed in the Bangalore Rural Lok Sabha seat.The meeting, which comprised Gaurav Gogoi, Supriya Sule, T R Baalu, Ramgopal Yadav, N K Premachandran, Derek O'Brien, John Brittas, KC Venugopal, felt other issues though important should be kept aside as distraction.Interestingly, the opposition decided to adopt the Trinamool Congress's appellation of SIR, calling it ""vote chori"". It was felt SIR is too esoteric for the common man to grasp its political significance.Rahul is learnt to have argued that issues in Parliament are effective, but BJP is winning elections on the ground through a different strategy focused on electoral rolls. An MP quoted Rahul as saying that after defeats in states that appeared tilted towards Congress, the party believed it was because of weak organisation. But after studying Bangalore Rural, it is convinced there are other reasons. ""We have found a pattern,"" he reportedly said.Sources said the opposition is unanimous on the issue, and the ball is in the government's court on accepting the demand for a discussion on Special Intensive Review.","The opposition decided to adopt the Trinamool Congress's appellation of SIR, calling it ""vote chori"" It was felt SIR is too esoteric for the common man to grasp its political significance.

"No category called 'suspicious voters' in RP Act, can't manipulate EVMs: Law minister",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-category-called-suspicious-voters-in-rp-act-cant-manipulate-evms-law-minister/articleshow/123030274.cms,".

NEW DELHI: There is no category of voters called ""suspicious voters"" under the Representation of the People (RP) Act, law minister Arjun Ram Meghwal said on Thursday in response to a question in Rajya Sabha.Samajwadi Party MP Ramji Lal Suman raised the question whether in the last Lok Sabha elections suspicious voters had also cast their votes. He said there is a lot of speculation about suspicious voters, and alleged that the results can be manipulated on electronic voting machines (EVMs). He asked the minister if the votes were being cast correctly. Election Commission has informed that there is no category of suspicious voters as per the RP Act,"" the minister said, and added that EC further informed that ""the election results cannot be manipulated on EVMs"".Meghwal said there is no doubt in the fairness and integrity of EVMs which, he said, have stood the test of several elections, public and legal scrutiny over the years. ""EC has further informed that in at least 42 petitions against use of EVMs which have been filed before various high courts and Supreme Court, and after going through various aspects of the technological soundness and the administrative safeguards involved in the use of EVMs, the courts have repeatedly held that EVMs are tamper proof, credible and reliable,"" the minister added.He said EC has mentioned that to dispel any apprehension of any kind, EVM-related documents, such as manual on EVM and VVPAT, presentation on EVM, status paper on EVM, legal history of EVMs and VVPATs and FAQs are available in public domain on EC website that anyone can check.","Law minister Arjun Ram Meghwal says there is no category of voters called ""suspicious voters"" under the RP Act.

Parliament must review powers of speaker under anti-defection law: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/parliament-must-review-powers-of-speaker-under-anti-defection-law-sc/articleshow/123030197.cms,"Telangana speaker breached Parliament trust: SC

NEW DELHI: In a significant judgment, the Supreme Court on Thursday said to protect foundations of democracy, Parliament must take a call on the effectiveness of the anti-defection law mechanism, which has been virtually blunted due to the widely-perceived partisanship of speakers, leading to delays in deciding disqualification petitions against political turncoats.Chief Justice B R Gavai and Justice A G Masih gave this ruling while directing the Telangana assembly speaker to decide within three months the disqualification petitions filed against 10 BRS MLAs who defected to Congress after it formed govt in the state following the Nov 2023 elections.The verdict marks a departure from the restraint that courts have shown in setting deadlines for speakers and could well be a precedent in settling defection-related cases in the future.The CJI-led bench also directed the speaker not to allow the 10 MLAs, facing disqualification proceedings, to protract proceedings.""In the event any of such MLAs attempt to protract the proceedings, the speaker would draw an adverse inference against him,"" the bench said.Constitutional courts have generally refrained from fastening speakers with a timeline to decide pending disqualification petitions. However, SC said since the Telangana speaker has delayed adjudication of disqualification petitions by more than a year, it warranted issuance of directions to him.The bench was critical of the way the speaker issued notice on the disqualification petitions seven months after they were filed, and said such a delay breached the trust Parliament reposed in presiding officers to adjudicate defection cases fearlessly and expeditiously. In the 2023 elections to the 119-member assembly, Congress had won 64 seats, BRS 39, BJP eight, AIMM seven and CPI one. However, Congress's numbers rose after the defection of the 10 BRS MLAs.Writing the 74-page judgment recording numerous instances of speakers' deliberate inaction in speedy adjudication of disqualification petitions against MLAs, CJI Gavai said, ""It is for Parliament to consider whether the mechanism of entrusting speakers the important task of deciding the issue of disqualification on the ground of defection is serving the purpose of effectively combating political defections or not?"" ""If the very foundation of our democracy and the principles that sustain it are to be safeguarded, it will have to be examined whether the present mechanism is sufficient or not. ..it is for Parliament to take a call on that,"" the CJI said.SC reiterated the settled law that speakers/chairman of assemblies, Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha function as tribunals while deciding disqualification petitions under the anti-defection law, and that their decisions can be scrutinised by the HCs and the apex court. CJI Gavai examined the purpose behind enactment of the anti-defection law in 1985 through a constitutional amendment and said the only purpose of entrusting the work of adjudicating the disqualification petitions to the speaker/chairman was to avoid dilly-dallying and resultant delay in the courts of law or the Election Commission's office.He said, ""Parliament decided to entrust the important question of adjudication of disqualification petitions, on account of defection, to the speaker/chairman expecting him to decide them fearlessly and expeditiously."" CJI Gavai and Justice Masih said, ""With the experience of over 30 years of working of the 10th Schedule to the Constitution, the question that we will have to ask ourselves is as to whether the trust which Parliament entrusted in high office of the speaker or the chairman of avoiding delays in deciding the issue with regard to disqualification has been adhered to by the incumbents in the high office of speaker and the chairman or not?""Referring to a chain of cases under the anti-defection law marred by inordinate delay in adjudication by speakers across states, already frowned upon by SC in as many cases, the bench said, ""We need not answer this question, since the facts of the various cases themselves provide answer.""",Supreme Court says Parliament must take a call on effectiveness of the anti- defection law mechanism. Chief Justice B R Gavai and Justice A G Masih gave this ruling while directing the Telangana assembly speaker to decide within three months the disqualification petitions filed against 10 BRS MLAs.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123030205,imgsize-157042,width-400,resizemode-4/123030205.jpg"
