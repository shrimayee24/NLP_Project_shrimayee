‘Bihar Got Not Even 1% of Gujarat’s Share’: Tejashwi Yadav Explodes at PM Modi

PATNA: INDIA bloc CM face Tejashwi Yadav 's projection as ""jannayak (people's leader)"" and ""nayak (hero)"" has been contested not only by BJP but also by a senior within his own RJD , with its national general secretary Abdul Bari Siddiqui taking exception to such labels.Siddiqui said it would take Tejashwi time and hard work to get the title of Jannayak, which is exclusively used for former Bihar CM and Bharat Ratna Karpoori Thakur. ""Tejashwi is engaged in politics based on his father and RJD chief Lalu Prasad's legacy. He is the virasat (legacy) of Lalu Prasad's politics and may get this honour after establishing himself by following the footsteps of his father and Thakur,"" Siddiqui added.While RJD posters with Tejashwi's photograph, captioned ""Bihar ka Nayak"" have come up ahead of next month's assembly elections, he as well as Congress Lok Sabha opposition leader Rahul Gandhi were first called jannayak during ""Voter Adhikar Yatra"" in the state over a month ago against the special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls. The row seems to have intensified after Congress put up social media posts on Monday with videos and photos of Rahul, describing him as jannayak.Tejashwi's estranged elder brother Tej Pratap also disapproved of such titles. ""Calling yourself jannayak doesn't make you a people's leader. Karpoori Thakur, Ram Manohar Lohia, Ambedkar and Mahatma Gandhi were the real jannayaks. Rahul and Tejashwi are under the ""chatrachaya (protection and patronage) of Lalu Prasad. If that protection is removed, they will be nothing,"" Tej Pratap said.BJP's Shehzad Poonawalla seized on Siddiqui's statement to claim that neither the public nor his own colleagues had confidence in Tejaswhi. ""Despite contesting elections for years, he has failed to earn people's trust. Even within his circle, from RJD's Abdul Bari Siddiqui to SP MLA Ravidas Mehrotra, besides his brother Tej Pratap, no one sees him as a true leader,"" he said.Another BJP spokesperson, Ajay Alok, took the title tiff further, saying Tejashwi ""is not a nayak but nalayak"".","Tejashwi Yadav's projection as ""jannayak (people's leader)"" and ""nayak"" has been contested not only by BJP but also by a senior within his own RJD.

Bihar polls: Chirag Paswan backs Nitish Kumar as NDA's CM face; clarifies Amit Shah's remark,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-polls-chirag-paswan-backs-nitish-kumar-as-ndas-cm-face-clarifies-amit-shahs-remark/articleshow/124873485.cms,"In Khagariya, Amit Shah Frames Bihar Poll As Choice Between NDA's Five Pandavas And RJD's Jungle Raj

NEW DELHI: Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) chief Chirag Paswan on Tuesday endorsed Nitish Kumar as the NDA's chief ministerial face for the upcoming Bihar assembly elections and offered clarification on Union minister Amit Shah's recent ""MLAs will decide"" remark.""How many times does it need to be said that chief minister Nitish Kumar is the NDA's face,"" Paswan told reporters in Delhi, adding that ""the coalition is contesting the polls under Nitish’s leadership.""""Chief minister Nitish Kumar is leading the elections, and as the Home Minister has already said, MLAs will come and MLAs will elect — that’s the normal democratic process,"" the Hajipur MP said.""When people cite Rajasthan’s or Madhya Pradesh's example, they forget that in there, one party was contesting and had already declared its CM face,"" he added.Paswan’s remarks came days after Amit Shah clarified that while the NDA is contesting under Nitish Kumar’s leadership, the decision on who will be chief minister will be taken after the elections by the elected legislators.""Who am I to say so? Yes, we are contesting the polls under Nitish Kumar’s leadership. After the elections, NDA legislators will decide who will be CM,"" Shah had said, sparking speculation that the BJP might be keeping its options open.The LJP (Ram Vilas) chief also took aim at the Opposition’s INDIA bloc for declaring RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav as its chief ministerial candidate.""By mistake, and under pressure from his party, he has been named CM candidate — and he’s behaving as if he’s already the CM,"" the Union minister said.""Rahul Gandhi avoided doing this because he knows that as soon as Tejashwi is projected, people will start recalling the jungle raj and recoil in fear,"" he added.He further accused the RJD of coercing its allies, claiming that promises like the deputy CM post to Vikassheel Insaan Party leader Mukesh Sahni were politically motivated. ""And what do they hope to gain by promising Mukesh Sahni the Deputy CM's post? The way he has been coerced into submission by the RJD is not lost on his Nishad community.""Within the NDA, leaders continue to praise Nitish Kumar’s administrative record, though there is genuine uncertainty over whether Nitish will remain CM.Since 2005, Nitish has led every Bihar election, whether with the NDA or the Mahagathbandhan — but this time, questions persist about whether he will continue if the alliance returns to power.The BJP and JD(U) have agreed to contest 101 seats each under an equal seat-sharing formula.

PATNA: Both NDA and INDIA blocs have fielded candidates from the same caste in several constituencies of Magadh region, making for riveting battles, reports Abdul Qadir.Belaganj is particularly gripping. The seat, long regarded as the bastion of RJD strongman Surendra Prasad Yadav, the Jehanabad MP, saw a twist in Nov 2024 when his son Vishvanath Yadav lost to his family's rival, Manorma Devi of JDU, in a bypoll. The father-son duo's image is once again at stake as Vishvanath faces Manorma in a rematch.According to district JDU president Dwarka Prasad, Belaganj is ""a prestige fight"" since it is contesting only one of 10 assembly segments in Gaya. BJP district president Prem Prakash echoed him.In Bodh Gaya, RJD MLA Kumar Sarvajeet faces LJP (RV)'s Shyam Deo Paswan. Both are Paswans, a community that has historically dominated this seat, winning eight times between 1972 and 2020.A face-off is taking place in Barachatti, where MLA Jyoti Devi takes on RJD's Tanushri Manjhi. Jyoti is related to Union minister and former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi, while Tanushri is the granddaughter of late Bhagwati Devi, both former MLAs from Barachatti.In Wazirganj of Gaya district, Congress veteran Awadhesh Singh faces BJP's Birendra Singh. Both are Rajputs. Awadhesh entered the Bihar assembly in 1980, while Virendra's debut came in 2010.Family rivalry defines the contest in Nawada, where JDU candidate Vibha Devi, wife of Rajballabh Yadav, faces Kaushal Yadav of RJD. Both recently swapped parties.In Hisua, Congress MLA Nitu Kumari and BJP's Anil Singh, both Bhumihars, are in the fray. In Aurangabad, Congress MLA Anand Shankar Singh faces BJP's Trivikram Singh.
