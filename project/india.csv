MUMBAI: As Maharashtra heads to elections on Thursday for 29 municipal corporations, all eyes are on Mumbai, where the BJP-led Mahayuti is locked in a battle with the united Thackeray front for control of the cash-rich Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).Polling for the 2,869 seats spread across 893 wards will begin at 7.30 am and conclude at 5.30 pm on January 15. A total of 3.48 crore voters are eligible to decide the fate of 15,931 candidates, including 1,700 in Mumbai and 1,166 in Pune. Counting of votes will take place on January 16.More than 25,000 police personnel, including senior officers, will be deployed across Mumbai to oversee elections to the BMC and vote counting. Except for Mumbai, the other 28 urban bodies have multi-member wards.This will be the Shiv Sena’s first BMC election since the 2022 split, when Eknath Shinde broke away with a majority of the party’s legislators, along with its name and symbol. The undivided Shiv Sena had held sway over the country’s richest civic body for 25 years.In a political turn ahead of the elections, estranged cousins Uddhav and Raj Thackeray reunited after two decades in their bid to consolidate Marathi votes, even as rival NCP factions forged a local alliance in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad.In this election, the Opposition Congress has asserted its presence in Mumbai by stepping out of the shadow of its Maha Vikas Aghadi allies — Shiv Sena (UBT) and Sharad Pawar's NCP (SP). The Congress has joined hands with Prakash Ambedkar’s Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) and the Rashtriya Samaj Paksh in the state capital, even as it contests independently in Nagpur.Elections to 29 municipal corporations are being held after a gap of over six years, with their terms having ended between 2020 and 2023. Of these, nine fall within the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), the most urbanised belt in India.The battlegrounds include Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, Navi Mumbai, Vasai-Virar, Kalyan-Dombivli, Kolhapur, Nagpur, Mumbai, Solapur, Amravati, Akola, Nashik, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Pune, Ulhasnagar, Thane, Chandrapur, Parbhani, Mira-Bhayandar, Nanded-Waghala, Panvel, Bhiwandi-Nizampur, Latur, Malegaon, Sangli-Miraj-Kupwad, Jalgaon, Ahilyanagar, Dhule, Jalna, and Ichalkaranji.Chief Minister Fadnavis, along with his deputies Eknath Shinde and Ajit Pawar, campaigned extensively across Maharashtra, while cousins Uddhav and Raj Thackeray concentrated their efforts on Mumbai, Thane, Nashik, and Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, where Uddhav held a rally. Telangana minister Mohammad Azharuddin, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi, and Tamil Nadu BJP leader K Annamalai were also among the star campaigners for the polls.Populist promises for women were the highlight of the manifestos of both the Mahayuti and the Shiv Sena (UBT)-MNS. The Mahayuti has promised a 50 per cent concession for women in BEST bus travel, while the Thackeray cousins have assured a Rs 1,500 monthly allowance for women domestic helps and a property tax waiver on houses up to 700 sq ft. The Congress manifesto, by contrast, prioritises combating Mumbai’s pollution, upgrading the BEST fleet, and strengthening the city’s financial health.The race for Mumbai’s mayoral post took centre stage in the campaign, with the BJP claiming that a Sena (UBT) victory could lead to a Muslim mayor, a charge the Uddhav Thackeray-led party countered by assuring voters of a Marathi mayor. CM Fadnavis also guaranteed that the mayor will be a ""Hindu and Marathi.""In the 227-ward Mumbai, the BJP is contesting 137 seats, the Shiv Sena 90, while the NCP is fighting separately on 94 seats. The Shiv Sena (UBT) has fielded 163 candidates, the MNS 52, the Congress 143 and the VBA 46. The Congress has fielded 1,263 candidates across the rest of the state.The Maharashtra State Election Commission on Friday announced that Thursday, January 15, will be a public holiday in areas falling under the 29 municipal corporations where polling will be held, an official said.The holiday will apply to government and semi-government offices, corporations, boards, public undertakings, banks, and central government offices within the jurisdiction of the civic bodies.The poll comission said administrative preparations, including readiness of EVMs, have been completed and urged the public to take an active part in the democratic exercise.","Elections to 29 municipal corporations are being held after a gap of over six years.

AAP National Convener Arvind Kejriwal , speaking at a Regional Booth Worker Conference, which is being held in Ahmedabad on Sunday, called for a pledge to end hooliganism in Gujarat.The former Delhi CM further alleged that whenever elections approach, agencies such as the ED, CBI, and police become active, and he warned that oppression will increase in the coming years.""Gujarat is the land of Sardar Patel and Mahatma Gandhi.

Mamata Banerjee Hits Streets, Leads Kolkata Rally Against ED Raids

NEW DELHI: Trinamool Congress (TMC) national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee on Sunday accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of blocking central funds meant for West Bengal. His remarks came on a day when the prime minister addressed a rally in the poll-bound state, urging voters to end the TMC’s 15-year “maha jungle-raj. ”“You blocked funds meant for the people of Bengal and harassed them. You inflicted miseries on the people of Bengal over the last five years, and so your party will be reduced to below 50 seats in the assembly polls,” Banerjee said while addressing a rally in West Bengal’s Nadia district.His aunt, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee—who also heads the TMC—has repeatedly accused the BJP-led Union government of withholding central funds for the state and has made the issue a key poll plank.The Diamond Harbour MP further asserted that the fall of the BJP-led government at the Centre would begin in West Bengal.“In the coming days, the people of Bengal will throw you out of power in Delhi after electing the TMC for the fourth time. ‘Poriborton habe’ (there will be change at the Centre),” he remarked.On the recent Enforcement Directorate raids at the Kolkata office of I-PAC—a leading political consultancy that has been working with the TMC since 2021—Banerjee accused the Centre of “misusing” central agencies against opposition-run states.“They tried to steal our data before the elections, but we have people’s support. They (the BJP ) have everything—from the ED and CBI to a section of the media. They put central agencies behind me before the 2021 elections but failed. Now they are resorting to falsehood,” he stated.Referring to the ongoing revision of electoral rolls, Banerjee claimed that despite allegations of large numbers of illegal immigrants, the exercise had identified 54 lakh “unmapped voters"" in the state.“Now, unhappy with the findings, they are planning to delete over one crore names from the electoral rolls. We will not allow this to happen,” he alleged.Buoyed by its success in the recent assembly elections in neighbouring Bihar, the BJP is eyeing its first stint in power in West Bengal, where the TMC, under Mamata Banerjee, has been in office since 2011.","Abhishek Banerjee accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of blocking central funds meant for West Bengal.

Mumbai And Pune Verdict Shake Thackeray And Pawar Dynasties As Legacy Politics Faces Reality Check







MUMBAI: The Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena dented the Sena (UBT)-MNS combine's tally but failed to beat the Thackerays in most Marathi-dominated areas across Mumbai. Contesting 90 seats, Shinde has won 29, so his strike rate turned out to be poorer than that of BJP. However, his party's seats are crucial to the BJP-Sena combine crossing the majority mark, and BJP cannot anoint a mayor in BMC without Shinde's support.The Shinde-led Sena went into BMC polls with 54 former corporators, but the numbers suggest many of them and their relatives lost this time. In fact, the kin of many of Shinde Sena's former and sitting MLAs and MPs were defeated.Despite fighting just 90 seats, Shinde's Sena was seeing 'family first' politics. Eight sitting and former MLAs/MPs had bagged tickets for family members. Former MP Rahul Shewale's sister-in-law Vaishali Nayan Shewale was fielded from ward 183 (Chembur), former MLA Sada Sarvankar's son Samadhan and daughter Priya were fielded from 194 and 191 (Worli, Mahim) respectively, while Jai Kudalkar, son of Kurla MLA Mangesh Kudalkar, was fielded from ward 169 (Kurla). Sena MP Ravindra Waikar's daughter Deepti Waikar-Potnis was given a nomination from ward 73 (Jogeshwari).They all lost.Similarly, Bhandup MLA Ashok Patil's son Rupesh Patil was given ticket from ward 113 (Bhandup). Former corporator Deepak Hande's wife Ashwini Hande has been given a ticket from ward 128 (Ghatkopar). They also lost to the Sena (UBT)-MNS combine.However, former MLA Yamini Jadhav, who lost the 2024 Lok Sabha and assembly polls and was also fighting the BMC polls. won from Byculla. Similarly, former Sena corporator Sanjay Turde's wife Meenal Turde was candidate from ward 166 (Kurla) and won. In Worli, wife of ex-Sena corporator Datta Narwankar, Vanita, won from ward 197 -- the only victorious Shinde Sena candidate from Worli.Sena Chandivli MLA Dilip Lande's wife Shaila Lande was a candidate from ward 163 (Chandivli) and got elected.Political observers said since the BMC polls this time were a multi-cornered contest, sitting MLAs and used their clout to 'accommodate' family members. As parties too could not find formidable candidates, netas extended their family quotas beyond the immediate family and even got tickets for in-laws and cousins. ""Usually, family tickets are given to immediate family like spouses and siblings, but this time since NCP was not in Mahayuti and Congress was not in MVA, there was a scramble for seats. Senior netas used this chance to flex muscle and get tickets for their kin. They managed to convince the party that there was no alternative. Parties too conceded as they didn't want to take any risk,"" a political observer said.",Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena dented the Sena (UBT)-MNS combine's tally.
