Maharashtra cops' flip-flop over nod lends drama to MNS protest march,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maharashtra-cops-flip-flop-over-nod-lends-drama-to-mns-protest-march/articleshow/122329095.cms,"MIRA BHAYANDAR: Amid high drama triggered by police's denial of permission and detention of local MNS functionaries, hundreds of MNS workers, supporters and locals took part in a march at Mira Road on Tuesday to counter a protest staged by traders last week against the assault on a shopowner by the party's activists for not speaking Marathi.Workers of Shiv Sena (UBT) and UBT Sena MP Rajan Vichare also joined the MNS activists midway, increasing the numbers. Shiv Sena minister Pratap Sarnaik visited the protest site in the afternoon but was heckled and forced to leave.Police had initially denied permission for the morcha. But as the crowd grew after 10 am and voices of protest were raised, police allowed the march to proceed. CM Devendra Fadnavis said there was no objection to holding a march and police had suggested the usual route sanctioned for it, but MNS insisted on a particular route and hence nod was denied. ""The police chief informed me that police had inputs some of them were likely to do something,"" the CM said.Many MNS functionaries, including Avinash Jadhav, MNS Thane and Palghar district chief, were detained early morning. Jadhav was taken into preventive custody. Around 10am, people started gathering for the morcha, and as numbers swelled, cops began detaining people there as well. Jadhav was released by noon, and in the afternoon, after protests, the morcha was allowed.Two MNS functionaries from Mumbai, Nitin Sardesai and Sandeep Deshpande, also joined. The Marathi Ekikaran Samiti was also part of the morcha.Minister of state for home Yogesh Kadam said there is no difference in treatment of Marathi and non-Marathi groups over rally permissions, but court guidelines must be followed. BJP MLA Narendra Mehta questioned the motive behind MNS's rally, calling it ""karna kuch aur, dikhava kuch aur"" (showing one thing, doing another).","Hundreds of MNS workers, supporters and locals took part in a march at Mira Road on Tuesday.

NEW DELHI: “Friends, men took part in the war while eunuchs went to the Sangh,” Congress MLA Sahab Singh Gurjar said during a protest in Ashoknagar on Tuesday, news agency PTI reported.A video of the remark surfaced online and was widely circulated, leading to accusations of 'sexism and insult to the third gender.Gurjar, who represents the Gwalior Rural assembly seat, made the statement while addressing a 'Nyaya Satyagraha' protest staged by senior Congress leaders, including Madhya Pradesh Congress chief Jitu Patwari, former chief minister Digvijaya Singh and Leader of Opposition Umang Singhar.The protest was organised in response to an FIR filed against Patwari, who has been accused of allegedly forcing a person to make false claims related to an incident in Mudra Barwah village.Last month, the Mungaoli police in Ashoknagar district registered a case after reports emerged that a youth from the Lodhi community had been assaulted and made to eat faeces.The BJP hit back strongly at Gurjar’s remarks and questioned whether similar language would be used for other Congress leaders who did not attend the protest.“Did the opposition leader use a similar word for former CM Kamal Nath and former Union minister Arun Yadav as they did not join the Congress’ ‘Nyaya Satyagraha’?” BJP leaders asked.Madhya Pradesh minister Vishwas Sarang termed the protest “unsuccessful” and alleged it was a “vulgar” agitation.“This protest presents a strong example of factionalism in the Congress,” Sarang said.Referring to Gurjar’s remarks, he added, “This statement of the Congress MLA was an insult to the third gender and women.”“The BJP strongly condemns such a statement in a civilised society,” the minister said.As of now, Sahab Singh Gurjar has not issued any clarification on his comment.","Congress MLA Sahab Singh Gurjar made the remark during a protest in Ashoknagar on Tuesday.
