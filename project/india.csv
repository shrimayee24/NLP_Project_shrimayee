CBI casting aspersions that entire judiciary is hostile: SC

Also read:

NEW DELHI: CBI 's complaint that it is having to contend with hostlity in the courts in West Bengal drew sharp reaction from Supreme Court which pulled it up for casting aspersions on the judiciary by branding all courts in the state as hostile, reports Amit Anand Choudhary. This amounts to contempt, it said.The agency took this ground to press for the transfer of trial in 42 cases related to post-assembly election violence in 15 districts out of West Bengal to another state.But a bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Pankaj Mithal took strong exception and said that the statement was contemptuous for which action could be taken against the officer involved in filing the petition.The agency had taken the stand that the accused in post-poll violence cases being investigated by the agency had been released without hearing it.""What ground have you taken? You are bracketing all courts as hostile. Blanket averments have been made that bail is being granted without hearing you. This is casting aspersions that the entire judiciary is hostile,"" the bench told additional solicitor general S V Raju.ASG said it was not about hostility inside the court but outside and admitted that the petition was loosely drafted. He, however, insisted that transfer of trial outside WB West Bengal was needed for free and fair proceedings, leading the bench to say that the agency had to first withdraw the blanket allegation.""If we transfer matters then we are certifying there is a hostile atmosphere over all the courts in the state and courts are not functioning. Your officers may not like the judicial officer or a particular state but don't say that the entire judiciary is not functioning. The district judges, civil judges and session judges can't come here and defend themselves. It is a fit case for contempt. How can you cast aspersions on the judiciary?"" the bench said.The court allowed CBI to withdraw the petition but noted its displeasure in its order. ""Scandalous allegations have been made against all the courts in WB . Repeatedly averred that there is a hostile environment . It is very unfortunate the central agency has chosen to cast aspersions on courts in WB . Learned ASG states there was no intention to cast aspersions. However the averments are to the contrary. He seeks permission to withdraw. We make it clear that all objections to the proposed transfer are expressly kept open,"" the bench said.","CBI's complaint that it is having to contend with hostlity in the courts in West Bengal drew sharp reaction.

Jharkhand moves contempt plea against Centre in SC for delay in appointing CJ,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jharkhand-moves-contempt-plea-against-centre-in-sc-for-delay-in-appointing-cj/articleshow/113506040.cms,"Centre's deliberate inaction violates

Article 216

: Jharkhand to SC

NEW DELHI: In a first, Jharkhand government has moved Supreme Court seeking contempt of court action against the Centre for its ""deliberate and wilful"" delay in implementing the SC collegium 's July 11 resolution recommending appointment of Justice M S Ramachandra Rao as chief justice of the state, reported.In its petition, the Hemant Soren govt said the state was without a chief justice for two months, since the retirement of Justice B R Sarangi on July 19.It said the SC's five-member collegium led by CJI D Y Chandrachud, anticipating the vacancy, had recommended to the Centre to transfer the Himachal Pradesh HC CJ to Jharkhand HC as its CJ.It said despite the passage of more than two months, the Union govt was deliberately sitting over the SC collegium's recommendation, a situation that displayed the Centre's complete disregard for the highest court's decisions.Jharkhand govt said Centre's deliberate inaction on the collegium resolution was also in violation of Article 216 of the Constitution, which says, ""Every high court shall consist of a chief justice and such other judges...""Constitutional courts are empowered to initiate contempt of court proceedings against anyone who wilfully disobeys or ignoresjudicial orders of such courts. However, it is to be seen whether SC collegium resolutions can be put on the same pedestal as judicial orders to attract provisions of the Contempt of Courts Act if the Union govt disagrees or delays implementation.Seeking to push swift implementation of the collegium's recommendations, retired SC judge Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul had warned Centre of contempt of court proceedings but refrained from acting on the caution.SC, through three judgments in the 1990s, made the collegium the sole arbiter in appointments of judges to the apex court and HCs but it has not spelt out the timeframe within which the recommendations are to be implemented. Moreover, while the Centre cannot refuse to comply with the collegium's decision, it can seek a review by flagging issues which it feels escaped the attention of the body or did not get adequate consideration.Information about Jharkhand moving a contempt petition against Centre was shared by CJI Chandrachud with attorney general R Venkataramani when the top law officer was requesting adjournment of Friday's hearing on a PIL by Harsh Vibhor Singh, who sought time-bound implementation of the collegium's recommendations for appointment & transfer of HC judges.The AG told the bench of CJI and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra he would provide details on appointment of CJs to HCs next week. SC asked the AG to renew the request for adjournment on Friday as the case was already listed.Apart from recommending transfer of Justice Rao from Himachal Pradesh high court to Jharkhand, the SC collegium on July 11 had passed a resolution for appointment of chief justices to seven HCs. However, the Centre cited certain ""sensitive material"" to request the collegium to reconsider certain recommendations.Based on the material, the collegium on Sept 17 had changed its proposals on appointment of CJs to three HCs - Himachal Pradesh (after the retirement of Justice Rajiv Shakdher), Madhya Pradesh, and Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh.","In a first, Jharkhand government has moved Supreme Court seeking contempt of court action against the Centre. The state was without a chief justice for two months, since the retirement of Justice B R Sarangi on July 19. It said the SC's five-member collegium led by CJI D Y Chandrachud, anticipating the vacancy, had recommended to the Centre to transfer the Himachal Pradesh HC CJ to Jharkshand HC as its CJ.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113506676,imgsize-1522425,width-400,resizemode-4/113506676.jpg"

She said Bengal would ""disengage entirely"" from the PSU and its projects in the state if the Centre acted unilaterally.Union jal shakti minister C R Paatil disputed the CM's allegation , saying decisions pertaining to release of water from the Maithon and Panchet dams in Jharkhand during heavy rain were always made by a committee that included representatives of Bengal.Paatil said it was on Bengal's request DVC agreed to cut water release by 50% between Sept 14 and 17. Heavy rainfall on Sept 16-17 made it imperative to scale up water release ""to avoid a catastrophic impact on south Bengal due to possible dam failures"", Paatil said.He pointed out that water release was limited to 2.5 lakh cusecs, while the inflow to these dams was 4.2 lakh cusecs.More than 1,000sq km across 11 districts of south Bengal are battling floods, with around five million people affected.

Over two dozen secessionists join assembly polls in J&K,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/over-two-dozen-secessionists-join-assembly-polls-in-jk/articleshow/113534779.cms,"SRINAGAR: At least 25 former militants , separatists, and members of the banned Jamaat-e-Islami , and their relatives are running as independent candidates or on party tickets in J&K first assembly elections in a decade. This marks a notable shift towards mainstream political participation , moving away from the separatist boycotts that have dominated polls during three decades of militancy.The list of candidates includes prominent former separatists such as Zaffar Habib Dar, Syed Saleem Geelani, Javid Hubbi, and Aga Muntazir Mehdi.Zaffar is running as a candidate for J&K Apni Party. He sees participation in the democratic process as the key to resolving the issues in an altered scenario since the abrogation of Article 370 in Aug 2019 and the bifurcation of the region into Union territories — J&K and Ladakh.“We can solve problems only through the electoral process. Everyone should participate in the electoral process by casting their vote,” Dar said.JKLF ex-commander Farooq Ahmad Dar are among those running. Dar, also known as Saifullah Farooq, is running on a Samajwadi Party ticket from Habba Kadal constituency. Farooq, who was among the first militants in 1989 and crossed over to PoK for arms training, now regrets his decision. “That time everyone picked up the gun. We were misguided by Pakistan agents in Kashmir,” Dar said.After a year of militancy, he surrendered to police and spent nearly five years in jail. Farooq, who ran in the 2019 municipal elections on a BJP ticket, is now appealing to voters, emphasising his opposition to Pakistan’s interference in Kashmir.The Jamaat has strategically fielded independent candidates in about 15 constituencies, including Pulwama, Kulgam, Zainapora, and Devsar in south Kashmir, and Beerwah, Langate, Bandipora, Baramulla, Sopore, and Rafiabad in the north. Notable candidates include Talat Majid, Sayaar Ahmad, and Hafiz Mohammad.The Jamaat participated in elections until 1987. It had Hurriyat leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani serve as an MLA for three terms before the assembly was dissolved in 1990 because of militancy.Former member Sayaar Ahmad reflected on the organisation’s long absence from electoral politics. “We never called a poll boycott. We stayed away from elections as there was rigging in the 1987 assembly elections in which Jamaat-e-Islami candidates were also contesting,” Ahmad said, asserting that participation in elections is now seen as the only way to address the region’s long-standing issues.The former militants and separatists have banded together to form a political group named Tahreek-e-Awam to contest the ongoing elections.According to sources, the decision by these former separatists was influenced by the success of Abdul Rashid Sheikh, better known as Engineer Rashid, who defeated National Conference vice president Omar Abdullah and People’s Conference president Sajad Gani Lone in Baramulla during the Lok Sabha elections despite being imprisoned.Rashid managed to secure more than 4.7 lakh votes, largely attributed to sympathy and Kashmiri sentiment. Members of Tahreek-e-Awam see an opportunity in this wave of sentiment and aim to replicate Rashid’s success, sources said. Rashid’s Awami Ittehad Party (AIP), though not officially recognised, has also announced independent candidates for elections.","The list of candidates includes prominent former separatists such as Zaffar Habib Dar, Syed Saleem Geelani, Javid Hubbi, and Aga Muntazir Mehdi.

Proposal for national-level 'Sanatana Dharma Rakshana Board'

VIJAYAWADA: Deputy chief minister and Jana Sena president Pawan Kalyan proposed the formation of a ‘ Sanatana Dharma Rakshana Board ’ at the national level following controversy over the adulterated ingredients used in making Tirupati Laddu Prasadams.Pawan has raised serious concerns following reports of alleged contamination of the sacred Prasadam offered at the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) temple.The disturbing findings suggest the presence of animal fats, including fish oil, pork fat, and beef fat, in the Prasadam, sparking widespread outrage.Kalyan demanded that the TTD board, constituted under the YSR Congress Party govt, provide answers and take responsibility. He emphasised that such incidents not only hurt religious sentiments but also highlight broader issues related to temple desecration, land management, and dharmic practices.""Our govt is committed to taking the strictest action possible against this. However, this incident has exposed a deeper issue regarding the management and preservation of temple traditions,"" Kalyan stated.To prevent such incidents in the future, Pawan Kalyan proposed the formation of a ‘Sanatana Dharma Rakshana Board ’ at the national level. This board would oversee all issues related to temples across India, ensuring the protection of dharmic practices and safeguarding temple lands and rituals.Kalyan called for a national debate involving policymakers, religious leaders, the judiciary, citizens, and media to address the desecration of Sanatana Dharma and ensure that such incidents are not repeated.""We all need to come together to protect the sanctity of Sanatana Dharma and ensure that it is upheld in every form,"" Kalyan urged.",Pawan Kalyan has raised serious concerns following reports of alleged contamination of the sacred Prasadam offered at the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) temple.
