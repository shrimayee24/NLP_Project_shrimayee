Sex between consenting married adults not a crime: HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sex-between-consenting-married-adults-not-a-crime-hc/articleshow/120293706.cms,"Representative Image

KOLKATA: A physical relationship between two married adults, if consensual since beginning, does not amount to luring somebody with a false promise of marriage and is not a criminal offence, Calcutta HC's Jalpaiguri circuit bench recently held.Justice Bibhas Ranjan De on Friday said: ""Both parties are married and aware of each other's marital status. Then, the consent given under such circumstances shall be deemed consensual rather than coerced or misled by a false promise, as the initial consent for a physical relationship will be perceived to be based on mutual attraction. It is expected that both parties be aware of their respective marital obligations.""Holding that the ""culpable mentality and clandestine motives"" of the accused are not made out in a complaint where a married woman accused a married man of luring her into an intimate relationship by a false promise of marriage, the judge quashed the proceedings against the man.The complaint was lodged on Sept 8, 2024, by the woman. The brief of the case is that the two married people were in an "" extramarital affair "" for two years. After the woman's husband came to know of it and refused to live with her, she asked to marry the man with whom she was having the affair.When the man refused, woman filed a case against him under Sections 69 (sexual intercourse by employing deceitful means) & 351(2) (criminal intimidation) of BNS at Maynaguri police station.","A physical relationship between two married adults, if consensual since beginning, does not amount to luring somebody with a false promise of marriage.

"Lingayat, Vokkaliga netas huddle ahead of April 17 caste census meet",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lingayat-vokkaliga-netas-huddle-ahead-of-april-17-caste-census-meet/articleshow/120293360.cms,"BENGALURU: Karnataka govt is facing growing internal pressure after the leak of the caste census report that has sparked strong opposition from different quarters. Ahead of the special cabinet meeting scheduled on Thursday to discuss the report in detail, senior netas from the influential Vokkaliga and Lingayat caste groups have called meetings of their respective communities. Both communities maintain that their respective proportions in total population is much more than what the report has estimated.Deputy CM and PCC chief DK Shivakumar called a special meeting of Congress MLAs from Vokkaliga community Tuesday to address their concerns. ""We will have a discussion with them (Vokkaliga legislators) and suggest ways to ensure everyone is respected without hurting anyone's sentiments,"" Shivakumar said, adding govt will not take any 'hasty decision'.Forest minister Eshwar Khandre, who is a Lingayat, said: ""The opinion of the community's leadership and individuals will be collated so that it can be conveyed at the meeting."" CM Siddaramaiah has maintained silence on the issue, stating, ""I will talk about it in special cabinet meeting.""The caste census report was submitted to the cabinet on April 10, but its contents have not been officially released to the public. According to the leaked findings, the Vokkaliga population stands at 61.6 lakh, or 10.3% of the state's population, with a proposed reservation of 7%. Lingayats are placed at 11% (66.3 lakh), with a recommendation of 8% reservation. However, internal community divisions - Veerashaiva Lingayats at 10.4 lakh, Panchamasalis at 10.7 lakh, and others - have led to disputes over accurate representation.The leaked report estimates the Muslim population at 75.2 lakh - or 12.6% of the state's total - and suggests doubling their reservation from 4% to 8%. ""This is higher than Vokkaliga community, which is currently considered the second-largest population group in the state,"" the report says.Expelled BJP member and Vijayapura MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal questioned the report's credibility and challenged the continued categorisation of Muslims as a minority. ""If Muslims are the largest community, then strip the community of 'minority community' status. If the census report is to be accepted, then Brahmins who constitute just 2% of the state's population should be given the minority community status,"" he said.","The caste census report was submitted to the cabinet on April 10, but its contents have not been officially released to the public.

NEW DELHI: The political class rushed to embrace and celebrate BR Ambedkar with generous tributes on his 135th birth anniversary, adding to the unprecedented celebrations by his followers across cities, and cementing the iconic leader’s status as the sole bipartisan figure on the contemporary socio-political firmament.Political biggies PM Narendra Modi, Sonia Gandhi, Mallikarjun Kharge, Rahul Gandhi among others gathered for annual garlanding and floral tributes at the Ambedkar statue in the Parliament complex, while regional leaders like Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav and Tejashwi Yadav, and CMs Siddaramaiah, MK Stalin, Mohan Yadav among others attended public programmes to laud the framer of the Constitution. Telangana CM Revanth Reddy implemented the policy of “sub categorization of SCs” on the “auspicious occasion” of Ambedkar Jayanti, calling it a “great act of social justice”.The celebrations from the politicians merged seamlessly with the many roadshows and bus trips to Ambedkar parks taken out by Ambedkar’s common supporters, that turned towns and cities into a sea of blue.If Ambedkar is enjoying a pan-political popularity which appears unprecedented in post-independent India, it is largely owing to the emancipator having emerged as the bridge to the sprawling dalit populace that forms a critical vote base for the parties. The success of the anti-BJP opposition’s “Constitution in danger” campaign during the 2024 Lok Sabha elections appears to be egging the political organisations to make full-throttled attempts to appropriate Ambedkar.Evidently, the celebration presented an opportunity to undermine the claim of rivals on Ambedkar. At a rally in Haryana, Modi took potshots at Congress for “insulting” the late mascot during his lifetime with his election defeat in 1952 elections, and blamed the arch opponent for the condition of the deprived classes in the country. Congress chief Kharge retaliated by quoting Ambedkar to accuse RSS mascot VD Savarkar of plotting his poll defeat, and by calling RSS-BJP as the “enemies of Ambedkar”.","PM Narendra Modi, Sonia Gandhi, Mallikarjun Kharge, Rahul Gandhi among others gathered for annual garlanding and floral tributes.

HISAR: PM Narendra Modi accused Congress of humiliating Dr B R Ambedkar during his lifetime and attempting to erase his legacy after his death. ""Congress humiliated Baba Saheb Ambedkar while he was alive, ensuring his electoral defeats and conspiring to keep him out of the system,"" he said, speaking at an event in Hisar marking Ambedkar's birth anniversary Monday.""And when he was no longer among us, they tried to eliminate even his ideas. Congress has become the predator of the Constitution,"" Modi said.He accused the opposition party of distorting Ambedkar's vision of a just and equal society for political gain. ""Ambedkar wanted every poor and deprived person to live with dignity and realise their dreams. But Congress reduced SC, ST, and OBC communities to second-class citizens,"" he said.Modi highlighted development schemes under BJP-led govt, saying Har Ghar Jal Yojana provided tap water to 80% of rural households, up from 16% in 70 years when Congress was in office. He cited Swachh Bharat Mission, under which 11 crore toilets were built, as a measure that restored dignity to the marginalised. ""During Congress era, banks were a dream for SC, ST and OBCs. Today, they proudly hold Jan Dhan cards.""He contrasted BJP-governed states with opposition-led govts in Himachal, Karnataka and Telangana, accusing them of delaying projects and driving up living costs. ""While some govts stall projects or break promises, our model is one of delivery and development.""Modi criticised Congress for opposing the uniform civil code, recently enacted by BJP-led Uttarakhand govt. ""It's unfortunate those carrying the Constitution in their pockets oppose it in practice,"" he said. He accused the party of undermining Ambedkar's principles by introducing religion-based reservations in Karnataka.""If Congress truly cares for Muslims, let it make a Muslim party president and give 50% election tickets to the community,"" Modi said.

HYDERABAD: Telangana became the first state Monday to implement sub-categorisation of Scheduled Caste reservation by classifying 59 sub-castes into three groups, timing the move with Dr Ambedkar's 135th birth anniversary.The cabinet sub-committee on SC categorisation handed to CM Revanth Reddy the first copy of gazette notification along with the set of rules governing implementation of Telangana SC (Rationalisation of Reservations) Act, 2025.Telangana assembly had passed the SC sub-categorisation Bill on March 18, based on a seven-judge SC bench's Aug 1, 2024, verdict upholding the validity of sub-classifications within SC and ST categories.According to the gazette notification, 1% reservation in education and employment has been provided to SCs in Group I (15 sub-castes); 9% to Group II (18 sub-castes); and 5% to Group III (26 sub-castes).""Congress govt has done what no other party could. All parties extended verbal support for SC categorisation, but none took it to implementation. We have done it legally, inclusively, and with full preparedness,"" said minister N Uttam Reddy, who chaired the cabinet sub-committee.He mentioned that the state govt issued four general orders to legally fortify its action.Sub-committee deputy chief Damodar Rajanarasimha stressed the govt's commitment to social justice, saying he and the chairperson would meet chief secretary A Santhi Kumari and senior officials Tuesday to discuss vacancies in all govt departments. Both assured the SC community that the quota would be raised in line with their increased population after 2026 census. The current sub-categorisation is based on 2011 census.""The group quotas include 33% reservation for women. If vacancies are not filled due to unavailability of SC candidates, they will not be given to candidates from other community but carried forward. Efforts will be made to fill all vacancies at the earliest. The categorisation will not apply to job notifications issued by state and central govts before the Act came into force. In fact, the Congress govt has not issued any job notification after Aug 1, 2024,"" Uttam Reddy said.""On the auspicious day of birth anniversary of Dr Ambedkar, Telangana govt paid best tributes by bringing into force a great Act of Social Justice, addressing a demand of classification of SC sub-castes (sic),"" Revanth wrote on X.","Telangana assembly had passed the SC sub-categorisation Bill on March 18, based on a seven-judge SC bench's Aug 1, 2024, verdict.
