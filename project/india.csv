'Clear picture in one week ... ': Will BJP become Champai Soren's 'good friend' in Jharkhand?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/clear-picture-in-one-week-will-bjp-become-champai-sorens-good-friend-in-jharkhand/articleshow/112688497.cms,"Will Champai Soren add value to BJP in Jharkhand?

Will Champai's exit harm JMM?

The problem of part-time chief ministers

NEW DELHI: Former Jharkhand chief minister Champai Soren , who is on his way out of the ruling Jharkhand Mukti Morcha ( JMM ) after alleging ""insult and humiliation"" by the party, on Wednesday said he will not retire from politics and is ready to chart a new path, either by forming an organisation or by joining hands with any ""good friend (ally)"" who comes along the way.Champai, who was in the national capital amid reports that he is exploring options of joining the BJP , said he will take a final decision on his future course of action in a week's time. The former chief minister lost his cool when reporters suggested that there may not be enough time for forming a new party.""What is your problem? When 30,000 to 40,000 supporters have assembled here for me on a day's call, why do you think forming a new party will be difficult for me? I can easily form a new party or align with a friend,"" Champai Soren said.Champai was sworn in as 12th chief minister of Jharkhand on February 2 after Hemant Soren was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate in a money-laundering case. The party had then chosen him over Hemant's wife Kalpana Soren to lead the Jharkhand government. However, the bonhomie was short-lived. Less than a week after Hemant Soren was released on bail on June 28, Champai had to step down to make way for his predecessor.The senior JMM leader has claimed that he was insulted and humiliated by the party and was forced to choose an alternative path for himself. Champai had taken to social media on August 18 to share details of how he was marginalised within the party and abruptly asked to resign as chief minister. Champai also alleged that all his government programmes in the first week of July, when he was the chief minister, were abruptly cancelled by the party leadership without his knowledge.The post on X and his subsequent visit to Delhi via Kolkata, where reports said he met a senior BJP leader, set the stage for speculations of his new innings with the saffron party in Jharkhand.Champai Soren, without any doubt, is among the tallest tribal leaders of Jharkhand. The 67-year-old was once the most trusted aide of JMM patriarch Shibu Soren and had earned the sobriquet of ""Jharkhand's Tiger"" for his contribution to statehood fight.However, unlike Shibu Soren or his son Hemant, Champai does not have a huge mass following in the state. He is a 7-time MLA representing the Saraikela constituency in assembly and a very popular leader in the region.Champai after raising the banner of revolt is hopeful of finding a ""good friend"" with whom he can move forward. The ""good friend"" is perhaps a refernce to the BJP, which has heaped praise on him but has been guarded in its reactions over possible induction of Champai Soren into the saffron party.The BJP in Jharkhand already has two former tribal chief ministers in its fold - Babaulal Marandi and Arjun Munda. The saffron party also has a third former chief minister in the state Raghubar Das, who is now the governor of Odisha. However, the gubernatorial role does not rule him out from electoral politics in future as we saw during Lok Sabha elections when Tamilisai Soundararajan stepped down as Telangana governor and contested the polls for BJP in Tamil Nadu. In fact, Raghubar Das is the only leader to have completed the full term of five years as chief minister since Jharkhand was formed in 2000.The BJP would want to use Champai to counter Hemant Soren but what role can the BJP offer him? That perhaps would be the key to BJP's gameplan.Nearly half of the 81 assembly seats in Jharkhand are dominated by tribal population and that is why induction of Champai Soren may help the BJP in some areas of the state. This is definitely important for the saffron party which failed to win even one of the five Lok Sabha seats reserved for Scheduled Tribes in the state -- Khunti, Lohardaga, Singhbhum, Rajmahal and Dumka in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.The BJP would also be wary of any possible negative fallout of Hemant Soren's charge of poaching leaders with money in an election year. The Jharkhand chief minister has accused the BJP of ""destabilising parties and breaking families."" The BJP would rather have him out of the JMM but not in the saffron party till the assembly elections. The fact that none of the BJP leaders have met him till now, seems to suggest that the saffron party has still not taken a final decision on the issue.And while the BJP top brass debates the pros and cons of having Champai Soren on board ahead of the year-end assembly elections, the JMM will definitely need to worry about the possible negative impact of his exit from the party in the Kolhan region.On record, most of the JMM leaders have said that if Champai Soren decides to leave, it will not make any difference to the party's electoral prospects. Champai, who started as an independent before joining the JMM, has been an integral part of the party for decades. His decision will influence several local leaders of Kolhan region and also the party workers for whom he has been a guiding figure.However, JMM would cite the case of Sita Soren, the elder daughter-in-law of Shibu Soren who had joined the BJP ahead of Lok Sabha elections, but could not win in the family stronghold of Dumka.Hemant Soren, who already faces the charge of making JMM a family party, will also have to contend with a strong BJP campaign against him over dynasty politics and also his ""greed"" for the chair.The favourbale court observations in the ED case has emboldended Hemant Soren, who is confident of defeating the BJP if elections were held today.In the last assembly elections, the JMM won a comfortable majority in the state in alliance with its INDIA bloc partners including the Congress.Champai Soren is not the first part-time chief minister to land in such a situation. There have been instances in the past when part-time chief ministers have been forced to make bitter partings with the party and their leaders.Jeetan Manjhi, who was made chief minister of Bihar by Nitish Kumar after he resigned in 2014 taking moral responsibility for JD(U)'s humiliating Lok Sabha peformance is a case in point. Then we had O Paneerselvam who took the top post in Tamil Nadu when Jayalalitha was in legal trouble in disproportionate assets case and ended up leaving the party.Clearly, Champai should have seen this coming. After all, he was not the first choice as chief minister for the JMM. As he gets ready to start a new chapter in his political life, he would hope that he gets to meet ""good friend"" on the way to kickstart his new innings.",Former Jharkhand chief minister Champai Soren says he will not retire from politics. The 67-year-old is exploring options of joining the saffron party. Champai was sworn in as chief minister on February 2 after Hemant Soren was arrested.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112688971,imgsize-38152,width-400,resizemode-4/112688971.jpg"
'Forced to step back ... ': Congress hits out at Modi 3.0 over lateral entry U-turn; BJP says 'needlessly excited',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/forced-to-step-back-congress-hits-out-at-modi-3-0-over-lateral-entry-u-turn-bjp-says-needlessly-excited/articleshow/112685666.cms,"Opposition needlessly excited: BJP



NEW DELHI: The Congress hit back at the Modi government 3.0 on Wednesday saying those who considered the Lok Sabha election results a triumph for the BJP might now be grasping the true significance of the mandate, as the NDA government has been compelled to retreat four times in just two months.A day after the Centre took a U-turn on UPSC lateral entry advertisement, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh, in a post on X, said the public has put a stop to the Prime Minister through the power of their votes.Pointed out the withdrawal of the proposal for lateral entry into IAS positions, the Congress leader said, ""The latest example is the cancellation of the proposal of lateral entry for IAS posts. Due to strong criticism from the opposition and the voice raised from all over the country, within just three days the government had to abandon the plan of recruiting its favourite people in the bureaucracy .""He also mentioned that the government had to withdraw the draft of the Broadcasting Services (Regulation) Bill, 2024, in response to criticism.""The government, which has been forcibly passing bills by ignoring Parliament for 10 years, was forced to send the Waqf (Amendment) Bill to Parliament's joint committee. And in view of the huge resentment of the middle class, the government also had to restore the indexation benefit on the sale of property,"" he said.BJP's Amit Malviya, however, defended the U-turn saying ""flexibility and sensitivity remains the key"". In a long post on X, Malviya said, ""The opposition is needlessly excited, claiming victory of sorts, just because the ‘Lateral Entry’ notification, issued by the UPSC, has been withdrawn.""Clarifying that the notification has been withdrawn and not cancelled, Malviya said, ""A more specific notification likely to follow, with clear elucidation of guidelines and defined provisions of social justice, so that usual suspects can’t vitiate the environment.""""In first term, Modi Govt withdrew the Land Acquisition Bill and in second the three Farm Laws. So, the Govt is open to feedback, not obdurate. Similarly, in the first 10 years, several Bills were sent to the Standing Committees for review. Those citing Waqf Amendment Bill should note,"" he said.Malviya added that ""nothing has changed"". ""Flexibility and sensitivity remains the key. Opposition is unlikely to get an issue to agitate. They can claim moral victory all they want,"" he wrote.With the issue of reservations in lateral entries , the opposition picked up from where it left off in its Lok Sabha election campaign when it turned BJP's ambition to post a 400+ score to its advantage by alleging that the bid for super majority was meant to scrap caste quotas by amending the Constitution.The Centre's decision came amid increasing criticism from both the opposition and the NDA allies.Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge said the Union government had to cancel the recruitment due to resistance by a strong opposition. ""Recently they introduced lateral entry. They tried to appoint joint secretary (rank officers) ... But I heard that lateral entry appointments have been withdrawn. This is because the opposition is strong,"" Kharge said.Meanwhile, NDA allies also welcomed the move.LJP chief Chirag Paswan expressed gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for listening and addressing the ‘pain’ of backward classes.“We thank the Prime Minister for taking back the partisan proposal and making course corrections for the benefit of all communities including the backward and marginalised classes. This shows PM Modi’s firm belief in ensuring principles of social justice,” Paswan said.He also said that his party lodged a protest against the lateral entry program on the grounds that since previous governments didn’t give weightage to the reservation, it didn’t mean that we should also follow the same precedent.HAM chief Jitan Ram Manjhi welcomed the rollback order and said that this was a step in the right direction and also credited the PM for the move.“PM Modi has rightly taken note of the public sentiment and ordered the cancellation of UPSC advertisement,” he said.","Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said the public has put a stop to the Prime Minister through the power of their votes.

FIR against Ghosh may trigger graft probe by ED,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/fir-against-ghosh-may-trigger-graft-probe-by-ed/articleshow/112695258.cms,"NEW DELHI: The FIR registered by Kolkata Police against Dr Sandip Ghosh, ex-principal of RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, can be the ground for the Enforcement Directorate to initiate a money-laundering probe into allegations of corruption levelled against him by the West Bengal govt's health department.On a day when Ghosh's former colleagues accused him of engaging in selling uncliamed bodies and trafficking in bio-waste, sources in the ED said that while no enforcement case information report, equivalent to a police FIR in a money-laundering probe, has been registered yet in the case, the possibility of the agency taking up an investigation against the accused under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) cannot be ruled out.Already a demand has been made for an ED investigation against Ghosh and the other accused, allegedly involved in financial irregularities at the hospital during his tenure since 2021, with a former deputy superintendent of RG Kar Hospital, Akhtar Ali, moving the Calcutta high court to seek a money-laundering probe against the principal. Ali has claimed that he had complained to the state authorities against Ghosh for irregularities but no action was taken on his plaint filed last year.The former RG Kar Hospital principal is currently being interrogated by the CBI, which is looking at his role in the rape and murder of a doctor with the hospital.Ghosh is also alleged to have promoted cartels for procurements and construction work in the hospital and having received bribes. The ED's probe under the PMLA is more extensive in terms of establishing a money trail to track proceeds of crime, and this also involves questioning other suspects, including contractors, middlemen and politicians.Kolkata Police have registered an FIR at Tala police station on Monday based on a complaint from the health department of West Bengal govt, accusing Ghosh and others of a criminal conspiracy and alleged nexus with contractors in award of procurements and works related to the hospital. The probe involves a period starting from 2021, after Ghosh was made in-charge of the hospital administration.The state govt has transferred the case registered at Tala police station under the Prevention of Corruption Act to a special investigation team (SIT) constituted for probing the rape and murder incident. Though the CBI has questioned several accused and recorded the statements of the victim's parents, it is yet to disclose if it has registered any FIR in the case.","Kolkata Police have registered an FIR at Tala police station on Monday based on a complaint from the health department of West Bengal govt.

Seat share

What happened in the last assembly elections?

NEW DELHI: A Maharashtra opinion poll conducted earlier this week suggests that Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) will emerge as the single largest party, detailing how many seats the party is expected to win in the upcoming elections.The Matrize survey suggests that despite internal rifts and challenges within the MVA , the BJP-led alliance might have a strong showing.However, the final outcomes will depend on various factors, including voter turnout, alliance dynamics, and campaign strategies in the run-up to the elections.The Maharashtra Assembly elections are slated to take place later this year, but the Election Commission of India (ECI) has yet to announce the official schedule. While announcing polls in J&K and Haryana, the EC said it is keeping Maharashtra for later as the state is still dealing with heavy rain and has a long festive season and streak of religious events ahead. Besides, the EC added, the high requirement of forces in J&K did not leave scope for adding Maharashtra in the schedule announced on Friday.A tight race is expected between the ruling Mahayuti Alliance and the opposition's Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA). The survey also indicates that around 42 seats in the state will have a close contest.The ruling Mahayuti Alliance is composed of the BJP, Eknath Shinde's Shiv Sena, and Ajit Pawar's Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). The opposition MVA includes Shiv Sena (UBT), NCP ( Sharad Pawar ), and Congress.The Matrize survey reveals that BJP is projected to secure a 25.8% vote share.Congress is expected to follow with 18.6%, while Thackeray's Shiv Sena is predicted to garner 17.6%. Shinde's Shiv Sena is likely to obtain a 14.2% vote share. The two NCP factions are expected to have a vote share under 10%, with Ajit Pawar's faction estimated at 5.2% and Sharad Pawar's faction at 6.2%.Other parties are projected to collect 12.4% of the votes.The Maharashtra Assembly consists of a total of 288 seats. Regarding the seat share, BJP within the Mahayuti coalition is predicted to win between 95 to 105 seats. Shinde's Shiv Sena is forecasted to secure 19 to 24 seats, and Ajit Pawar's NCP wing is expected to get 7 to 12 seats.Within the MVA, Congress is likely to emerge as the largest party, with an estimated 42 to 47 seats. Thackeray's Shiv Sena is projected to win 26 to 31 seats, and Sharad Pawar's NCP faction is estimated to receive 23 to 28 seats. Other parties are expected to secure between 11 to 16 seats.This will be the first assembly election in Maharashtra with both Shiv Sena and the NCP represented by two separate factions.In the 2019 Maharashtra Assembly elections, BJP won 105 seats, while the unified Shiv Sena secured 56 seats. The combined NCP bagged 54 seats, and the Congress obtained 44 seats. Eventually, Thackeray formed the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance with Congress and NCP, and Thackeray assumed the position of chief minister.However, in June 2022, a split occurred within the Shiv Sena when Shinde, along with 39 other party MLAs, allied with the BJP, leading to the Mahayuti coalition coming to power.",The Maharashtra Assembly elections are slated to take place later this year. The Election Commission of India (ECI) has yet to announce the official schedule. A tight race is expected between the ruling Mahayuti Alliance and the opposition's Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA),"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112621384,imgsize-698422,width-400,resizemode-4/112621384.jpg"

Second CM from Karnataka to face prosecution

BENGALURU: In a significant blow to Karnataka ’s 15-month-old Congress govt, governor Thaawar Chand Gehlot on Saturday sanctioned the prosecution of chief minister Siddaramaiah in relation to the alleged Mysore Urban Development Authority ( Muda ) land allotment scam.The decision prompted immediate demands from the opposition BJP-JD(S) for Siddaramaiah to step down on moral grounds, causing concern among the Congress leadership.The governor's sanction was granted under ""Section 17A of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, and Section 218 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023,"" following petitions submitted by activists Pradeep Kumar SP, TJ Abraham, and Snehamayi Krishna.The petitioners are anticipated to approach the court in the coming week. TJ Abraham, one of the complainants, expressed his intention to seek the special court for public representatives to acknowledge the governor's sanction.The controversy revolves around the alleged irregularities in the allotment of compensatory sites. At the heart of the scam is a 3.2-acre parcel of land that was gifted to the Chief Minister's wife, Parvathi, by her brother Mallikarjunaswamy in 2010.Following the acquisition of the land by Muda, Parvathi sought compensation and was subsequently allocated 14 plots. These plots are said to be substantially more valuable than the original piece of land.The opposition parties claim that the total value of the scam could potentially fall within the range of Rs 3,000 crore to Rs 4,000 crore.Karnataka's chief minister Siddaramaiah, aged 76, is facing prosecution while in office, making him the second CM in the state's history to face such charges. The first was BJP's BS Yediyurappa in 2011. Ironically, Siddaramaiah, who demanded Yediyurappa's resignation as opposition leader in 2011, now faces similar charges and growing demands for his own resignation. The current situation resembles the events of 2011.In Yediyurappa's case, the then governor HR Bhardwaj approved the prosecution on December 12, 2010, based on a petition from advocates Sirajin Basha and KN Balaraj. The sanction was granted under ""Section 19(1) of the Prevention of Corruption Act1988, and Section 197 of Criminal Procedure Code-1973."" This decision led to controversy and widespread protests by the BJP.Despite pressure, Yediyurappa did not resign immediately. He held a cabinet meeting to condemn the governor's decision and engaging in a lengthy legal battle. He eventually resigned after months of political pressure and following an indictment by the then Lokayukta Santosh Hegde in the illegal mining scandal.The sanction against Siddaramaiah adds to the list of rare but significant instances in Indian political history where governors have taken decisive actions against chief ministers. Similar scenarios have occurred in other states, such as the cases of J Jayalalithaa, AR Antulay, and Lalu Prasad Yadav, all of whom resigned following the sanction to prosecute them.","Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah is facing prosecution over the Muda scam.

Bus services were affected in several districts of the state.Trains were delayed due to rail roko at some stations. They were against the Supreme Court's order to allow states to sub-categorise castes within the Scheduled Caste (SC) community.The SC and ST Joint Action Committee, Odisha , conducted picketing at Bhubaneswar and other cities of the state as part of the Bharat Bandh. They staged demonstrations at bus stops, rail stations, and busy thoroughfares, seeking seven demands. Govt offices, shops, and business establishments were closed at several places in the state. Though buses were not plying in several SC and ST dominated pockets of the state, cities were not affected much during the bandh.Joint Action Committee state coordinator Abhiram Mallick said Bharat Bandh in Odisha was peaceful and successful. “We want the Centre to promulgate an ordinance to make the SC judgment ineffective, file a review petition in the case before the apex court, frame an appropriate Bill and place it for approbation by the Parliament in the coming session to invalidate the judgment,” he added.They also demanded the Centre conduct a socio-economic-educational caste census, initiate necessary proceedings in the Parliament to place the reservation laws for SC-STs under the 9th schedule of the Constitution, and take different steps deemed proper for the development of SC and ST communities.BJD social media coordinator Priyabrata Majhi said BJD is fighting for the rights of SC and ST communities. “Under the leadership of Naveen Patnaik, the BJD-govt has done all-round development of these communities earlier. Our party is at the forefront to pay respect to the heroes of SC and ST communities. The silence of the BJP-led govt has pained the communities. We will take the next course of action on this issue after analysing the Supreme Court order,” he added.BJP Odisha’s SC Cell president Bibhu Prasad Tarai alleged that this Bharat Bandh call is given to defame the BJP govt. “The BJP govt always supports SC and ST communities. Odisha’s SC and ST communities have not shown interest in the Bharat Bandh. It is the conspiracy of the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance to create disturbances in the country,” he added.","The outfits were supported by left parties, Congress, trade unions and other outfits.
