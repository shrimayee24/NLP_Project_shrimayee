CHANDIGARH: Punjab govt stayed away from the Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB) meeting on Saturday - called to discuss the modalities for the release of an additional 4,500 cusecs of water daily to Haryana - citing preparations for the assembly session and flagging procedural irregularities in previous meetings.The governing AAP in Punjab termed the meeting ""illegal and unconstitutional"". At the meeting, BBMB indicated that it would take up the issue of withdrawal of Punjab Police security from Nangal dam .For this, a Bhakra Beas Management Board team led by chairman Manoj Tripathi will reach out to the state govt. The board will thereafter address the issue of releasing water to Haryana for eight days.Earlier, in a letter to BBMB chairman, Punjab's water resources secretary expressed state's inability to attend the meeting, and requested that the meeting be adjourned. The letter also accused BBMB of not adhering to its own regulations, stating that the laid-down procedure, which requires a minimum of seven days' notice for special meetings, was not being followed.In BBMB's last meeting with partner states Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan, the board had directed Punjab to immediately release 8,500 cusecs of water to Haryana despite strong opposition from the Bhagwant Mann govt.The special assembly session has been convened to discuss BBMB's decision to give additional water to Haryana . At the Punjab all-party meeting on Friday, a unanimous stand was taken against any attempt by BBMB to ""forcibly"" give extra water to Haryana, with all parties rallying behind state govt to protect the state's interests. The same tone had dominated Saturday's Haryana all-party meeting, too.","Bhakra Beas Management Board to meet Punjab govt before releasing water to Haryana.

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Saturday vociferously demanded that elections should be held in Manipur at the earliest as it alleged that President's rule imposed in February has failed to put an end to violence and the situation is far from normal.The opposition party trained its guns at Prime Minister Narendra Modi as it questioned why he has not visited strife-torn Manipur so far.With May 3 marking two years since violence first broke out in Manipur, the Congress leadership led by party president Mallikarjun Kharge claimed that since January 2022, the last election rally of the PM in Manipur, Modi has made 44 foreign visits and 250 domestic visits across the nation. “Yet you have not spent a single second in Manipur. Why this apathy and disdain for the people of Manipur? Where is the political accountability?,” Kharge asked in a statement.Mocking the BJP slogan, he said, ""Your double assault govt is still failing Manipur. Despite the home ministry's rule in place now, incidents of violence haven't stopped, Kharge alleged and added, “ Modi ji once again you failed upholding—Rajdharma!!”.Addressing a press conference at AICC in Delhi, Congress’ Manipur in-charge, Saptagiri Ulaka, and the Pradesh Congress Committee president, Keisham Meghachandra Singh highlighted that the President’s Rule had neither helped in improving the situation nor in restoring peace and the confidence of people. They also questioned the intention of the govt for not making public the report of the commission constituted by the home minister on the violence.“The violence began on May 3, 2023 and still continues. Just two days ago, 25 people were injured in a violent clash in Tamenglong district. More than 260 people have died. 68,000 people displaced and thousands are still living in relief camps,” Kharge said.Meghachandra pointed out that despite the formation of the Peace Committee in 2023, no meeting has been held till now.Earlier in the day, Congress general secretary in-charge of communications, Jairam Ramesh said, ""what began on May 3, 2023, therefore, was the self-dictated, self-directed derailment of the so-called double engine sarkar in the state. Three months later, the Supreme Court was compelled to declare that there had been an absolute breakdown of Constitutional machinery in the state.""""The anguish and suffering of Manipur continues. Political games are being played. No worthwhile reconciliation process is under way,"" he added.","The opposition party trained its guns at Prime Minister Narendra Modi as it questioned why he has not visited strife-torn Manipur so far.
