NEW DELHI: Two major national political parties have continued occupying govt bungalows in Lutyens’ Delhi for their party offices, even years after building their own headquarters or getting land for the purpose, flouting norms.Though the policy specifies that three years after getting land for office or completing construction, political parties must vacate bungalows, BJP and Congress occupy two bungalows each.Sources said it was in 2018 when the directorate of estates under the housing and urban affairs ministry had sent notices to Congress to vacate four govt accommodations it had occupied. The party has so far vacated two such accommodations.“The rule applies to all political parties. Now, BJP occupies two govt bungalows on Ashoka Road and Pandit Pant Marg, and Congress has two bungalows under its occupation on Akbar Road and Raisina Road. There is no indication of when these parties will vacate the bungalows. At present, around half a dozen bungalows are occupied by political parties,” a source said.As per the policy for allotment of land to national political parties of 2012, parties that occupy bungalow(s) or suite(s) in the Vithalbhai Patel House for their office, should vacate them immediately on the construction of office building on the plot allotted to them or within three years from taking possession of the vacant plot.The land and development office (L&DO), under the housing ministry, had allotted BJP two plots on the Deen Dayal Upadhyay Marg and the party inaugurated its office in Feb 2018. Nearly five years after that, BJP continues occupying bungalows at 11, Ashoka Road and 14, Pandit Pant Marg.In the case of Congress, though the govt had allotted it land on Kotla Road, adjacent to the DDU Marg in 2010, it recently completed the construction of its office after getting several extensions. The new party headquarters will be inaugurated on Jan 15. Sources said Congress is unlikely to vacate the two bungalows, which house its national and youth wing offices, considering that BJP has also not done so.In June 2022, in response to questions on enforcing parties to vacate bungalows, then housing and urban affairs minister Hardeep Singh Puri had told reporters, “It (evictions of political parties) is in process. It will involve all political parties. It’s in the pipeline.”Officials said sending any fresh notice to political parties to vacate bungalows even after building a new office is a “sensitive” issue.","BJP occupies two govt bungalows on Ashoka Road and Pandit Pant Marg.

"After Omar criticism of INDIA, Sanjay Raut questions MVA relevance",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-omar-criticism-of-india-sanjay-raut-questions-mva-relevance/articleshow/117130726.cms,"Uddhav Thackeray, Rahul Gandhi. (Photo/Agencies)

MUMBAI/PUNE/NAGPUR: A day after Jammu & Kashmir CM Omar Abdullah sought clarity on whether INDIA bloc had reached its expiry date, the alliance's Maharashtra-specific version, MVA, on Friday seemed to implode into a blame game over its recent assembly election defeat . Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut said that now his party and other MVA constituents wanted to fight the upcoming municipal and zilla parishad polls independently. Congress MLA Vijay Wadettiwar echoed the sentiment.NCP (SP) chief Sharad Pawar expressed displeasure over the failure of the MVA leadership to convene a meeting of constituent parties after the assembly results were declared and MVA suffered a crushing defeat. While Raut, whose party chief Uddhav Thackeray leads MVA, went so far as to say there was a question mark over the relevance of the alliance, Wadettiwar alleged a ""big conspiracy"" against his party.Wadettiwar said the ""unnecessary"" MVA delay in finalising seats cost the Congress time to campaign. ""Meetings were scheduled for 11am, but some leaders would turn up at 2pm. Discussions would drag on endlessly. And this triggers an obvious question whether these delays were part of a conspiracy, a bigger plan,"" Wadettiwar said.Raut hit back: ""Who came late for the meeting is known to Wadettiwar. And maybe, if Congress had let go of some seats in Vidarbha then these discussions would not have dragged on endlessly. Congress's central leadership did not act in time.""Even NCP (SP) MP Amol Kolhe at an internal party meeting in Mumbai is said to have targeted both Congress and Sena (UBT). ""Kolhe mentioned that Congress's broken back has not yet straightened while Sena (UBT) is yet to get up from its slumber. Other members also blamed the lack of coordination by Congress and Shiv Sena during the assembly election campaign,"" an NCP (SP) member said.Wadettiwar, while reacting to queries from the media, advised Kolhe to ""focus on his party rather than worry about Congress"". As with the INDIA bloc, the relevance of which Abdullah and others like RJD politician Tejashwi Yadav questioned in light of coordination issues and the tussle between constituents AAP and Congress in the Delhi assembly election, the MVA also seems to be disintegrating with hardly any meetings happening among its members. Raut blamed the Congress for lack of dialogue among coalition partners. Raut said the MVA was a constituent of the INDIA bloc formed on the eve of the Lok Sabha election, where its performance in the state was impressive. He said in the recent assembly election, where the INDIA bloc had no role, the MVA performance was dismal.(With PTI inputs)","Congress MLA Vijay Wadettiwar alleged a ""big conspiracy"" against his party.
