"CEC: Vote should be where you live, not ‘native’ place",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cec-vote-should-be-where-you-live-not-native-place/articleshow/122191668.cms,"NEW DELHI: The special intensive revision of electoral roll in Bihar and eventually, rest of country, will not only exclude persons added as electors after 2003-04, on grounds of non-submission of documents to prove their Indian citizenship but also outmigrants who have avoided being registered as electors in the constituency where they are ordinarily resident, only to retain their vote in their “native” place and state or where they own a house.Confirming this, chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar told TOI, “As per Representation of the People Act (R P Act), you are entitled to vote only in the assembly constituency where you are an ordinary resident. For example, if you ordinarily reside in Delhi but own a house in Patna, your vote should be registered in Delhi, not in Patna”.According to Section 19 of the R P Act, 1950, every person who is not less than 18 years of age and ordinarily resident in a constituency shall be entitled to be registered in the electoral roll of that constituency. Section 20 goes on to explain the meaning of ‘ordinarily resident’, saying that a person shall not be deemed to be ordinarily resident on the ground only that he owns or is in possession of a dwelling house therein. It adds that a person absenting himself temporarily from his place of ordinary residence shall not, by reason thereof, cease to be ordinarily resident therein.It is a well-known practice in many states where outmigration is high, for instance, Bihar and UP, for migrants to retain their vote in their native village or town where their house or land is located, rather than shift their vote to a far-off place or state, say Maharashtra or Delhi, despite having ordinarily resident for long enough, by virtue of working there of having relocated there due to family member/s staying or working there.“Some of these migrants have been living away from their native places or where they own a house for years, but travel back during an election to vote in their home constituency. In fact, some political parties even pay for their travel to their native place to secure votes,” said an EC functionary.SIR in Bihar is aimed at putting an end to this trend, which is a violation of the laid down law. “An elector must choose the MLA or MP of the constituency where he is ordinarily resident and which is where he lives and works,” explained the functionary.","The special intensive revision of electoral roll in Bihar and eventually, rest of country, will not only exclude persons added as electors after 2003-04. It will also exclude outmigrants who have avoided being registered as electors in the constituency where they are ordinarily resident. It is a well-known practice in many states where outmigration is high, for instance, Bihar and UP.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122191742,imgsize-392473,width-400,resizemode-4/122191742.jpg"

RAIPUR: Three prominent doctors' organisations — Junior Doctors' Association (JDA), Chhattisgarh Doctors' Federation (CGDF), and CIDA — held a joint protest in Raipur on Saturday late evening.They submitted a detailed memorandum to the state health minister condemning the alleged misbehaviour and insulting remarks made by an additional collector against a senior lady doctor at Narayanpur District Hospital.The organisations stated that the use of objectionable words like ""do kaudi ke doctor"" (worthless doctor) not only undermined the dignity of the medical profession but also deeply insulted women. This incident caused widespread anger among doctors across the state.The organisations' primary demands include a public apology from the concerned official, an impartial inquiry into the incident, and assurance of disciplinary action. They also seek clear guidelines for the respect, dignity, and safety of doctors at their workplaces, priority for doctors in the allotment of F-type accommodation, and proposals for administrative reforms.The organisations proposed several administrative reforms, such as limiting inspections of health institutions to IAS officers, having health nodal positions and review meetings led only by senior administrative officials, and ensuring complaints related to doctors are investigated only by health department officials (CMHO/CS).They also requested that collectors be instructed to ensure respectful behaviour towards doctors and that no repressive action be taken against doctors participating in peaceful protests.Dr Resham Singh, President, JDA, Dr Heera Singh, President, CGDF, and Dr Piyush Srivastava issued a joint statement condemning the incident. They urged the state govt to intervene and take immediate action.Dr A S Chauhan, spokesperson, CIDA, stated that the govt has been formally informed about the matter through correspondence. He added that if satisfactory action is not taken quickly, organisations across the state may be compelled to suspend their services.The three organisations emphasised that this issue concerns the dignity and safety of the entire medical community, which cannot be ignored.Meanwhile, Narayanpur district collector Pratishtha Mamgain told TOI that the complaint was received on June 19, and the alleged incident may have occurred three to four days prior.“I constituted an inquiry headed by the Narayanpur district panchayat CEO, who is herself a doctor. Initially, the complainant and other doctors posted at the district hospital were reluctant to cooperate and also stalled the OPD work, affecting poor patients seeking treatment. Now that the complainant has begun cooperating, we are hopeful the issue will be resolved soon,"" the district collector said.",Three prominent doctors' organisations held a joint protest in Raipur on Saturday late evening.
