Ladakh Statehood Violence: BJP Blames Congress While Sonam Wangchuk Says Gen-Z Led The Protests

NEW DELHI: Conceding a key demand of the Ladakh Apex Body (LAB) and Kargil Democratic Alliance (KDA), the home ministry on Friday ordered a judicial inquiry into the “serious law and order” situation created in Leh town on Sept 24, 2025, which resulted in police action that claimed four lives.The judicial inquiry will be conducted by former Supreme Court judge B S Chauhan, the ministry of home affairs (MHA) said in a notification issued on Friday. He will be assisted by retired district and sessions judge Mohan Singh Parihar, who will serve as judicial secretary, and former IAS officer Tushar Anand who shall be the administrative secretary.The notification on the “impartial” judicial probe — which came on the eve of a planned silent march and blackout by the two outfits in Ladakh — could brighten the prospects of early resumption of talks with the two Ladakh outfits through the high-powered committee set up by the Central govt. However, despite the MHA having conceded LAB and KDA’s central demand to have a retired SC judge look into the Sept 24 events, their leaders had not called off their protests until the time of going to the press.Before the Sept 24 violence broke out, LAB and KDA had reached an agreement on reviving the HPC parleys after a gap of four months and were scheduled to meet home ministry representatives on Oct 6. In fact, some MHA officials were in Leh at the time of the violence, preparing the ground for the parleys in New Delhi.The violence, coinciding with the protest fast by activist Sonam Wangchuk to press for statehood and Sixth Schedule status, and the death of four individuals in police firing, however, upset these plans. LAB and KDA decided to put off a meeting with the Central govt until their demand for a probe led by a retired SC judge into the Sept 24 violence was conceded.The Govt had on Sept 29 stated that it has always been open for dialogue on Ladakh matters with LAB and KDA at any time and on any platform. In fact, the dialogue mechanism has already yielded some good results, in the form of 85% reservation to Scheduled Tribes of Ladakh, 33% quota for women in Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council (LAHDC) and protection to local languages, it added.",The judicial inquiry will be conducted by former Supreme Court judge B S Chauhan. He will be assisted by retired district and sessions judge Mohan Singh Parihar and former IAS officer Tushar Anand. The notification came on the eve of a planned silent march and blackout by the two outfits in Ladakh.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124653022,imgsize-1124297,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

CHANDIGARH: In another dramatic twist in IPS officer Y Puran Kumar’s suicide, Rohtak police on Wednesday registered an FIR of abetment to suicide and criminal conspiracy, naming all those mentioned in the final video of ASI Sandeep Kumar Lather, who allegedly shot himself on Tuesday after accusing Puran Kumar of corruption.The FIR (number 305) was registered at Sadar police station in Rohtak a few hours after Haryana CM Nayab Singh Saini visited Sandeep’s family in Ladhot village on Wednesday morning and promised justice.The FIR had not been made public at the time of filing this report, but according to highly placed sources, four persons are named in it — including the deceased IPS officer’s wife Amneet P Kumar, an IAS officer of 2001 batch, her brother Amit Rattan, who is an AAP MLA in Punjab, and head constable Sushil Kumar, who was Puran Kumar’s PSO and is now in jail remand in a corruption case.The FIR was registered under BNS sections 108 (abetment to suicide) and 61 (criminal conspiracy) on a complaint submitted by Sandeep’s wife Santosh. TOI contacted Amit Rattan but was yet to get any response till midnight.Sources say Virendra Badkhalsa, OSD to Haryana CM, informed Sandeep’s family about registration of FIR on Wednesday evening. TOI has spoken with two of the negotiators who were present when the contents of the FIR were read out to the family.Only then did Sandeep’s family agree to an autopsy. Around the same time, Puran Kumar’s body was being cremated in Chandigarh, 230km away, after eight days of stalemate.Sandeep’s body, which was so far kept in a hired freezer by the family, was taken to PGIMS Rohtak at night. Cremation will follow postmortem on Thursday morning, said sources in the family.Sandeep was part of the team that was investigating the case allegedly involving Puran Kumar, and was also involved in the arrest of Puran Kumar’s former PSO on Oct 5.It was this FIR, registered on Oct 6, that’s alleged to be the trigger for Puran Kumar’s suicide as Sushil was alleged to have given a statement that he was demanding money on behalf of Puran Kumar, who was then Rohtak IG.Haryana govt found itself battling on two fronts. Amneet and other members of the family had refused to allow autopsy until action was taken against DGP Shatrujeet Kapur and then Rohtak SP Narendra Bijarniya, who were among those named by Puran Kumar in his suicide note. Bijarniya was transferred on Oct 10 and Kapur was sent on leave on Monday midnight.Less than 12 hours after Kapur was sent on leave, Sandeep shot himself after releasing a final video in which he called Kapur honest and accused Puran Kumar of corruption. In the video, he said Puran Kumar’s suicide was due to “humiliation from corruption charges” and had “nothing to do with caste issues”.Sandeep’s family took away his body, kept it in a freezer in Ladhot, and refused to allow autopsy or cremation until an FIR was registered against all those he had named in the video and his four-page suicide note.The Haryana CM, accompanied by ministers Krishan Lal Panwar and Mahipal Singh Dhanda, rushed to the village on the outskirts of Rohtak on Wednesday morning to console the family. Sandeep’s sisters tearfully asked Saini what was their brother’s fault, and pleaded for justice, said a source.The CM assured the grieving family that appropriate action would be taken, and justice would be delivered.Apart from the FIR, the family wanted a job for a relative and financial assistance, to which govt agreed.","Haryana CM Nayab Singh Saini visited Sandeep Kumar Lather's family in Ladhot village on Wednesday morning and promised justice.
