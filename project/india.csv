NEW DELHI: Balasore BJP MP Pratap Chandra Sarangi on Monday accused Congress leader Rahul Gandhi of inappropriate behaviour during a scuffle outside Parliament building on December 19, likening his actions to those of a ""bouncer"" rather than a responsible leader of the opposition in the Lok Sabha—a position once held by esteemed figures like Atal Bihari Vajpayee Sarangi, who was injured in the incident, shared his account with reporters after being discharged from the hospital on December 28.Recalling the incident, Sarangi said, ""It happened when we (BJP MPs) were standing near an entry gate, peacefully protesting against the insult of Dr. Ambedkar , holding placards.""""Suddenly, Rahul Gandhi came along with some of his party colleagues and started pushing people to move ahead. He was behaving like a bouncer, not like the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha , a post once occupied by great personalities like Vajpayee ji,"" BJP MP added.Sarangi alleged that Gandhi's actions caused MP Mukesh Rajput to lose balance and fall, leading to Sarangi’s own injury. ""Rajput ji fell on me, and my head struck a hard surface, possibly a stone-like object, resulting in a deep cut,"" he recounted, mentioning that his head injury required stitches.When asked if Gandhi showed concern afterward, Sarangi acknowledged that the Congress leader briefly approached him but left quickly. ""He came near me when informed about the incident but displayed no genuine concern. My recovery is due to the blessings of Lord Jagannath,"" Sarangi said.","Balasore BJP MP Pratap Chandra Sarangi accused Congress leader Rahul Gandhi of inappropriate behaviour during a scuffle outside Parliament building on December 19.

This is a disgrace, and the DMK government must take responsibility,” he said, slamming law minister S Regupathy for defending the state’s actions.Annamalai also lambasted the police for their role in mishandling the case and demanded the removal of the Chennai police commissioner or the deputy commissioner involved.

Google Maps is once again in the news for the wrong reasons in India. Two cars crashed in Hathras, Uttar Pradesh after Google Maps allegedly led the drivers onto an under-construction highway. The accident injured six people, with two requiring hospitalization.Vimlesh Srivastava and Keshav Kumar, residents of Bareilly, were traveling to Mathura's Banke Bihari temple on Friday, December 27 night. After reaching the Sikandra Rau area in Hathras around 10 pm, Google Maps reportedly directed them onto the under-construction Mathura-Bareilly highway. Their car crashed into a mound of mud near Hathras Junction. While the airbags deployed, two passengers were injured.The victims also blamed local authorities for the accident, saying the lack of reflective signs and indicators on the unfinished road contributed to the crash.“We were supposed to take the service road but Google Maps directed us onto the highway. The lack of reflective indicators also led to the crash. Local authorities are at fault as well. They should have put up barriers or signages indicating that the road is not ready for use,” Srivastava told Times of India.In a similar incident, a family from Badaun traveling to Mathura ended up on the same under-construction highway because of incorrect directions from Google Maps. Their car crashed into a mud mound after being guided onto a closed road.While the police rescued the passengers, the car was badly damaged. Deputy superintendent of police Shyamveer Singh told TOI, “The two cars were involved in accidents after allegedly being misguided by Google Maps. The road is under development and the contractors have been asked to place barriers and reflective signage”.","Two cars crashed in Hathras, Uttar Pradesh after Google Maps allegedly led the drivers onto an under-construction highway.
