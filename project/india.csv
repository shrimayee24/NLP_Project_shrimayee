Poll Do you believe that the actions of Rahil Shaikh represent the values of the MNS? Yes, they reflect MNS values No, they do not represent MNS values

NEW DELHI: Mumbai Navnirman Sena (MNS) came under opposition fire on Monday after a video of a party leader's son abusing a Marathi-speaking woman went viral amid the Hindi language row.In the video, Rahil Shaikh , son of MNS leader Javed Shaikh, was seen rabidly abusing the woman, who confronted him for hitting her vehicle.Rahil Shaikh, who presumably seemed under the influence of alcohol, was heard threatening the woman about his father's political position.Hitting out at the MNS, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Nirupam asked if MNS workers were ""attacking Hindus under pressure from these very Muslims"".""Drunk. Half-naked. The son of an MNS leader was hurling abuses at a Marathi-speaking woman. And on top of that, flaunting his father's influence. This is the true face of those who claim to protect Marathi pride. Are MNS workers attacking Hindus under pressure from these very Muslims?"" asked Nirupam on X.Mumbai police said that the incident occurred at Vira Desai Road in Andheri West.FIR was registered at Amboli police station, and the youth has been detained for medical examination. His car was also taken into custody for further probe by Mumbai police.Another BJP leader alleged that MNS has been dividing Hindus on language and creating a ""Maratha-Muslim"" votebank like Lalu’s Muslim-Yadav combination in Bihar.""This is respect for Marathi Manoos ? This is respect for Marathi? Rahil Shaikh, son of MNS leader Javed Shaikh, in drunken stupor, in a semi-naked state, abuses a Marathi Mulgi Rajshree More with BC gaaliya, tells her to shut up & take the money; also insults cop on duty,"" co-convenor BJP Mumbai PallaviCT wrote.""Now FIR filed against him. Would request @MumbaiPolice to also give her protection as she’s allegedly getting threatening calls & messages from MNS. The Thackerays are looking at Marathi-Mus!im combination to help them win elections & that’s why they are DIVIDING us. Divide Hindus on language & create MM votebank in Maharashtra like Laloo’s MY combination in Bihar. After all, the Thackerays are also from Bihar,"" she further added.","Mumbai Navnirman Sena (MNS) came under fire on Monday after a video of a party leader's son abusing a Marathi-speaking woman went viral.

'Patak patak ke marenge': BJP MP Dubey targets Thackerays amid language row; draws Aaditya's ire,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/patak-patak-ke-marenge-bjp-mp-dubey-targets-thackerays-amid-language-draws-aadityas-ire/articleshow/122301604.cms,"'Patak Patak Ke...': BJP MP Dares Thackeray Cousins Over Marathi Language Row, Aaditya Hits Back

NEW DELHI: BJP MP Nishikant Dubey on Monday triggered a fierce political row in Maharashtra after warning opponents that “tumko patak patak ke marenge” (we’ll thrash you thoroughly) while responding to MNS chief Raj Thackeray ’s call to target Hindi speakers.Speaking in Guwahati, Dubey told ANI, “You people are surviving on our money. What kind of industries do you have?... If you are courageous enough and beat those who speak Hindi, then you should beat all those who speak Urdu, Tamil, and Telugu. If you are such a big 'boss', come out of Maharashtra, come to Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu - 'tumko patak patak ke maarenge'.”""We all respect Marathi and the people of Maharashtra, who fought for India's independence. The BMC election is due, and hence, Raj and Uddhav are doing cheap politics. If they have courage - they should go to Mahim and beat any Hindi or Urdu speaking people in front of Mahim dargah,"" the BJP MP further added.Leading the response was Shiv Sena (UBT) MLA Aaditya Thackeray, who accused the BJP of attempting to fracture Maharashtra through divisive rhetoric. “This is exactly the BJP’s mentality, which is anti-Maharashtra,” he told reporters.“We have asked everyone not to react to such crazy and dirty minds because they want to create fear and instability in Maharashtra… This mentality of the BJP’s MP represents the entire BJP; this does not represent North India.”Thackeray stressed that the issue was not between languages but an orchestrated effort by the BJP to inflame tensions for electoral benefit. “People from all over the country come to Maharashtra with dreams and hopes… Our fight is against the government, not against any language,” he said.Criticising Dubey’s remarks as “shameless,” Aaditya added: “Dubey is not the face of North Indians. He represents the BJP… These remarks were made with a political intent to divide Marathi and Hindi-speaking people.”Congress spokesperson Atul Londhe Patil dismissed Dubey’s intervention as ignorant. “He is foolish. This controversy is not about language,” Patil said. “It is about whether two other languages, besides their mother tongue, should be taught to students of Std 1 to 4. The child can get confused… Congress respects all languages but is against diverting from ‘Balmanasshastra’ and confusing children.”NCP-SCP MLA Rohit Pawar accused Dubey of importing poll strategies from Bihar to stir unrest in Maharashtra. “I request Nishikant Dubey ji not to try and implement election strategies specific to Bihar in Maharashtra. While he is thinking of the West Bengal and Bihar elections, he is disturbing the sense of equality in Maharashtra,” he said.Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi also demanded accountability from the state leadership. “Earlier, BJP MLA Ashish Shelar compared Marathi Hindus with Pahalgam terrorists, and now Nishikant Dubey has made a statement. I want to ask the CM, why does he go quiet when it comes to standing for the state?”The row comes amid a larger political campaign by MNS and Shiv Sena factions, who have joined forces to oppose what they call the imposition of Hindi in Maharashtra’s schools. The state government recently reversed its earlier decision to introduce Hindi as a third language in primary schools, but the controversy has continued to escalate.",BJP MP Nishikant Dubey triggered a fierce political row in Maharashtra after warning opponents that “tumko patak patak ke marenge” (we’ll thrash you thoroughly) Dubey was responding to MNS chief Raj Thackeray ’s call to target Hindi speakers.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122301642,imgsize-1049944,width-400,resizemode-4/122301642.jpg"
