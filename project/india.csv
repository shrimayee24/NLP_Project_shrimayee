'Inform parents': Gujarat may tweak marriage norms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/inform-parents-gujarat-may-tweak-marriage-norms/articleshow/128627801.cms,"Gujarat deputy CM Harsh Sanghavi, who has itnroduced the proposal

GANDHINAGAR: The BJP govt in Gujarat has proposed 'anti-love jihad' amendments to marriage registration rules that would require couples to inform their parents before registering their union - a move welcomed by AAP, met with silence by the Congress and flagged by legal experts as a potential constitutional violation.Under the draft rules introduced in the assembly Friday, couples seeking to register their marriage will have to submit an undertaking stating whether they have informed their parents. The assistant registrar will notify the parents of both bride and groom electronically, including over WhatsApp, or through physical communication.Registration will be granted within 30 days after verification, with all submitted details uploaded to a govt portal.Deputy CM Harsh Sanghavi, who introduced the proposed changes, said the govt had nothing against ""love marriage"" but couldn't allow deception in the name of mutual consent. ""Innocent girls are being trapped and such practices are spreading like termites in society. Salim masquerading as Suresh will not be allowed,"" he said.Citing instances from Panchmahal district, Sanghavi said investigations were ordered after nikaah certificates were allegedly issued in villages where there was no mosque or even a single Muslim family.In villages such as Kankodakui and Nathkuva, hundreds of such certificates were allegedly issued by talati-cum-mantris (village panchayat secretaries), Sanghavi said.In the assembly, AAP legislator Hemant Ahir, who had moved a private member's bill on similar lines earlier in the week, congratulated the govt on tabling the proposed amendments. ""Changes in the rules were the need of the hour. There were several loopholes in the rules,"" he said.BJP MLA Lavingji Thakor, a strong proponent of stricter norms, said the move would benefit families of all communities. Congress stayed mum.Several community organisations, including those representing the Patidar and Kshatriya Thakor groups, have long pressed for mandatory parental involvement in love marriages. Over the past three months, as many as 30 meetings were held between the state govt and representatives of various organisations to finalise the changes.Legal experts said the proposal might not stand judicial scrutiny. ""This infringes upon the fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution,"" said advocate Mahesh Baria. Fellow advocate Nilesh Bhavsar said while the govt had described the measure as mere intimation, parental objections could potentially influence registration decisions, leading to litigation.","BJP govt in Gujarat has proposed 'anti-love jihad' amendments to marriage registration rules.

Cong now wants MVA's sole winnable Rajya Sabha seat for itself,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cong-now-wants-mvas-sole-winnable-rajya-sabha-seat-for-itself/articleshow/128631833.cms,"Congress Party Flag

Mumbai: A tussle is brewing within the MVA over the selection of a candidate for the lone Rajya Sabha seat which the alliance can win in the upcoming RS polls. While Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut had revealed that NCP (SP) chief Sharad Pawar was keen on contesting, Aaditya Thackeray claimed the seat for the UBT Sena. Now the Congress has said that either one Rajya Sabha or MLC seat should come to it.""Since we have the second highest number of MLAs in the alliance, the Congress should get either a Rajya Sabha or MLC seat,"" said Congress spokesperson Atul Londhe on Friday.Sanjay Raut struck a conciliatory note on Friday, saying three parties in the alliance will sit together and take a decision on the candidate. ""We have enough numbers for one Rajya Sabha seat. The three parties will sit down and decide who is the best candidate for the interests and identity of Maharashtra. The decision will be taken unanimously,"" Raut said. The election is slated for March 16.When asked about NCP (SP) chief Sharad Pawar's possible candidature since his term is ending, Raut said, ""Sharad Pawar is a big leader of this country."" He added, ""Each party feels it is an important constituent and will seek opportunities.But finally, there is consensus.""Raut said it was important to send a Marathi-speaking candidate to the Rajya Sabha. ""We need to send a Marathi-speaking candidate to the Rajya Sabha who will raise issues in the interest of Maharashtra,"" he said.The question of a joint candidate within the MVA assumes significance in view of the speculation on talks of a merger between the NCP (SP), which is part of the MVA, and the NCP led by the late Ajit Pawar which is part of the ruling Mahayuti alliance. The MVA needs 37 votes to win a Rajya Sabha seat. It has 47 MLAs. The Sena (UBT) has the highest number at 20, followed by the Congress with 16 and the NCP (SP) with 10.","The MVA needs 37 votes to win a Rajya Sabha seat. It has 47 MLAs.

Mamata Banerjee vs Election Commission: Supreme Court Orders Judicial Oversight in Bengal SIR

TMC: SC order on SIR a no-trust vote against EC

New Delhi: In an unprecedented decision, the Supreme Court on Friday used its ""extraordinary powers"" to deploy judicial officers in West Bengal to decide claims for inclusion in voter list and speed up the completion of Special Intensive Revision of electoral rolls. The court emphasised that CM Mamata Banerjee should be aware of the consequences if the revision exercise is not concluded.The court explained that the unprecedented judicial intervention under Article 142 of the Constitution was necessitated by the ""extraordinary situation"" that has arisen in Bengal due to trust deficit and non-cooperation between EC and the Bengal govt.A bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi also, despite objections by the TMC-led govt, allowed the Election Commission (EC) to publish the revised electoral roll - 95% of the total list - on Feb 28, the deadline for publication of the final voter list, while the remaining inclusion claims are still being decided. The bench also did not agree with the contention of the state govt that electoral registration officers (EROs), and not the judicial officers, should have the final say in deciding claims of inclusion in the voter list.Trinamool Congress on Friday described Supreme Court's order supplanting judicial officers over EC-appointed officers to hear SIR's logical discrepancy cases as a ""no-trust vote against the EC"".In a post on X, the party said: ""This constitutes a scathing indictment of a constitutional body that has failed in the faithful discharge of its duties. It is also a powerful vindication of our principled fight to safeguard the rights of the people and uphold the integrity of the democratic process.""TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh said: ""Even the topmost court of the land appears convinced that the poll body is not neutral, nor competent, after saddling people with unjustifiable hearing notices.""","Supreme Court deploys judicial officers in West Bengal to decide claims for inclusion in voter list.

Rahul Gandhi: Defamation case: Rahul Gandhi records statement in Sultanpur court over remarks on Amit Shah,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/defamation-case-rahul-gandhi-records-statement-in-sultanpur-court-over-remarks-on-amit-shah/articleshow/128594639.cms,"‘I Challenge Rahul Gandhi’: Amit Shah Slams Cong For ‘Misleading Farmers’ On India-US Trade Deal

NEW DELHI: Leader of opposition in the Lok Sabha and Congress MP Rahul Gandhi on Friday appeared before the MP MLA court in Sultanpur and recorded his statement in connection with a 2018 criminal defamation case linked to his alleged remarks about Union home minister Amit Shah. He later left the court premises after attending the hearing.Next hearing for the case is scheduled for March 9.The case stems from statements Gandhi allegedly made during the 2018 Karnataka Assembly election campaign. A complaint was filed on August 4, 2018, by Vijay Mishra, a BJP leader in Sultanpur, alleging that Gandhi made objectionable and defamatory remarks against Amit Shah at an election rally in Bengaluru.According to the complaint, Rahul Gandhi had said that while the BJP claims to believe in honest and clean politics, it is led by a ""party president who is an accused in a murder case"". At the time, Amit Shah was serving as the BJP national president.The remarks referred to the 2005 Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter case. However, in 2014, a special CBI court in Mumbai had discharged Shah in the matter when he was Gujarat’s home minister.The complainant contended that Gandhi’s statement was defamatory and harmed Shah’s reputation.The Sultanpur MP MLA court later took cognisance of the complaint. In December last year, the court issued a warrant against Gandhi after he failed to appear in person.On February 20, 2024, Gandhi appeared before the court, surrendered and was granted bail. His counsel moved an application seeking bail, which was allowed after two sureties of Rs 25,000 each were submitted. The court subsequently fixed March 2 for the next hearing.In July 2024, Gandhi recorded his first statement before the court, denying the allegations and terming the case politically motivated.Following the cross examination of the complainant and witnesses, the court in January 2026 directed Gandhi to appear personally for examination under Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. This stage allows the accused to explain the evidence presented against him.His appearance on Friday was in compliance with that directive.The case is among several defamation matters filed against the Congress leader over remarks made during political campaigns. Gandhi has maintained that such cases are politically driven, while Congress leaders have said they have faith in the judiciary.Further proceedings in the matter are expected as the court continues to examine the evidence and hear arguments from both sides.","The case stems from statements Gandhi allegedly made during the 2018 Karnataka Assembly election campaign.
