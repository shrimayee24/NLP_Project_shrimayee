Key candidates in fray

BJP vs Congress takes centre stage

AAP relies on Congress, BJP rebels

NEW DELHI: After witnessing the weeks of high-octane poll campaigns for assembly elections, Haryana on Saturday will vote to elect MLAs for the 90-member House.With 1,031 candidates in the fray, electors in Haryana will be polling in a single phase to elect their assembly representatives.Chief electoral officer Pankaj Aggarwal confirmed to news agency IANS that 20,632 polling booths have been set up statewide, including 455 in the Panchkula and Kalka assembly constituencies.Polling will take place from 7 am to 6 pm, and a total of 2,03,54,350 people are eligible to exercise their franchise in the state.In Panchkula, deputy commissioner of police (DCP) Himadri Kaushik has briefed paramilitary forces and police personnel on security measures, emphasising the need for heightened vigilance, especially at sensitive polling stations.The poll body has laid down strict guidelines, with a zero-tolerance policy towards negligence during duty.In the high-stakes polls, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) is scrambling to save its citadel in the northern state, while the Congress is pushing against the saffron party to regain the ground it lost in 2014.In a bid to make inroads in Haryana, Arvind Kejriwal's AAP has decided to punch above its weight as it is contesting all the seats after its alliance talks with Congress faltered.Dushyant Chautala's Jannayak Janta Party (JJP), earlier BJP's ally, tied up with the Chandrashekhar Ravan's Azad Samaj Party (Kanshi Ram). The alliance is contesting all assembly constituencies in Haryana, with JJP competing on 70 seats while ASP on 20.Two other parties, ex-CM Om Prakash Chautala's INLD and Mayawati's BSP, have entered into a pre-poll alliance, expecting to sway a significant Jat and Dalit votes in its fold.Prominent among those in the fray include chief minister Nayab SIngh Saini (Ladwa), leader of opposition in Haryana assembly Bhupinder Singh Hooda (Garhi Sampla-Kiloi), INLD's Abhay Singh Chautala (Ellenabad), JJP's Dushyant Chautala (Uchana Kalan), BJP's Anil Vij (Ambala Cantt) and O P Dhankar (Badli), AAP's Anurag Dhanda (Kalayat) and Congress's Vinesh Phogat (Julana).Among the independent candidates include Savitri Jindal (Hisar), Ranjit Chautala (Rania) and Chitra Sarwara (Ambala Cantt).This election, there is a drop in the number of women candidates. Only 101 women are contesting for the Haryana election including Ambala's Shakti Rani Sharma and Shalley Chaudhary.As BJP eyes a hat-trick, Congress will look to make a comeback in the state after a decade. Both parties launched aggressive campaigns to win the support of the people of Haryana. As BJP relies on its 10-year development record, Congress is attempting to capitalise on anti-incumbency sentiment and issues such as the farmers' protest and the Agnipath Scheme, which offers short-term recruitment in the armed forces.In the run-up to the assembly elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi held four rallies in the state, targeting Congress on various issues, including corruption in land deals, urban-Naxal agenda, reservations, appeasement, dynasty politics and Article 370. On the other hand, Congress' campaign focused on allegations of misgovernance by former CM Manohar Lal Khattar, who led the BJP government in the state for nearly 9 and a half years.In a strategic move ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, the BJP replaced Khattar with Nayab Singh Saini as the CM of Haryana.AAP is independently contesting the Haryana assembly elections for the first time. The party has gained momentum in the final stages of campaigning, boosted by the release of former Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal from jail. AAP, which has fielded candidates for all seats, has offered tickets to disgruntled ticket aspirants from BJP, Congress, and INLD. The party has embraced five rebels from BJP, three from Congress, and one from INLD.AAP has fielded BJP rebels Satish Yadav in Rewari, Sunil Rao in Ateli, Krishna Bajaj in Thanesar, and Jawahar Yadav in Bawaal. Bajaj worked with BJP for around 44 years. The party also nominated Congress rebels Pradeep Jatoli in Pataudi, Bhim Singh Rathi in Radaur, and Adarshpal Gurjar in Jagadhari.According to AAP workers, Gurjar poses a serious threat to Congress candidate Akram Khan. The Jagadhri constituency is likely to witness an interesting fight between three Gurjars: BJP's Kanwar Pal and Congress's Adarsh Pal Singh, who are Hindu Gurjars, and Khan, who is a Muslim Gurjar. Additionally, former INLD spokesperson Ranbir Singh Lohan joined AAP and is now contesting from Narnaund, having previously announced his intention to contest as an independent candidate.The counting of the votes will be done on October 8, along with the Jammu and Kashmir, where elections were held after 10 years.","Haryana on Saturday will vote to elect MLAs for the 90-member House.

The protest against discontinuation of appointment of ST candidates notified under PESA (Provisions of the Panchayats (Extension of Scheduled Area) and inclusion of the Dhangar community among STs ahead of the assembly elections raised eyebrows as Zirwal, an NCP (Ajit) legislator, holds a constitutional post.The tribal MLAs which included Kiran Lahamate, Hiraman Khoskar and Rajesh Patil jumped off from the third floor around noon.
