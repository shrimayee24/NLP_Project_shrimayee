"BJP: Bowing to BJP pressure, RLD drops Haryana plan; eyes Jharkhand & Maharashta",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rld-bows-to-bjps-pressure-wont-contest-haryana-polls/articleshow/113157306.cms,"Haryana Polls: Vinesh Phogat & Bajrang Punia Join Congress; Sakshi Malik next?

LUCKNOW: Bowing to BJP pressure, ally Rashtriya Lok Dal has backed down from its demand to contest the Haryana assembly elections . The development shows BJP's upper hand over allies in the upcoming assembly polls in many states.Sources in RLD confirmed that the party had been demanding at least two seats in Haryana after joining the BJP-led NDA before the Lok Sabha polls.RLD, whose politics is mainly centred around farmers and Jats of western UP, was keen to enter Haryana to expand its presence given the sizable numbers of Jats and agricultural community there. Haryana goes to polls on Oct 5.Sources said RLD has also offered to give up its claim to contest from Meerapur assembly seat of UP, where a bypoll is due following the election of incumbent MLA Chandan Chauhan to Lok Sabha from Bijnor.In 2019 too, BJP had contested on all 90 assembly seats in Haryana and won 40 seats with 36.49% vote share.Experts said Jayant Chaudhary backing down on demand shows BJP's strategy to keep smaller allies like RLD in a 'subordinate role' in key elections, thus keeping the alliance structure favourable to the larger party's interests. ""This also seems to be part of the BJP's broader strategy to consolidate its political power in the region after losses in the Lok Sabha elections,"" said a political commentator.Significantly, Jayant, during his alliance with SP and Congress, had come in open support of the wrestlers who were protesting against former WFI chief and the then BJP MP Braj Bhushan Sharan Singh who has been accused of sexual harassment. Haryana decision is, however, in contrast to RLD's move to contest at least 10 seats in Jammu and Kashmir. RLD sources said that the decision to contest assembly elections in J&K was part of a larger strategy to keep up the electoral identity.Political experts said the dual approach—maintaining a strategic alliance in key states like UP while asserting independence in others—marks RLD's attempt to navigate the political landscape while protecting its core interests.RLD national general secretary (organisation) Trilok Tyagi said their alliance with BJP is mainly restricted to UP. ""In other states, we are taking decisions after considering our electoral requirements. Nevertheless, we need to strategise jointly and in cohesion with our alliance partners,"" he told TOI.RLD had earlier contested gram panchayat elections in J&K.Meanwhile, RLD has intensified its discussions with BJP to contest assembly elections in Jharkhand and Maharashtra. RLD national secretary Anupam Mishra, who is scheduled to tour Jharkhand from Sept 11, said the primary objective is to keep the morale of the party workers high.",RLD was keen to enter Haryana to expand its presence given the sizable numbers of Jats and agricultural community there.

JAIPUR: Rajasthan police on Saturday arrested a 50-year-old school principal in Uttar Pradesh's Deoria for allegedly tampering with the birth records of a 14-year-old rape survivor to help the accused secure bail by falsely claiming the girl was not a minor, thus weakening the Pocso case .The girl reported to Jaipur's Murlipura police station last month that her father and aunt had sold her to a Haryana-based man named Sandeep for Rs 2 lakh, said DCP Amit Kumar.She alleged that Sandeep raped her.

SRINAGAR:

National Conference (NC) vice-president Omar Abdullah accused BJP Saturday of “striking secret deals” with some regional parties and Independents to form a govt in J&K after the Sept 18 to Oct 1 asssembly polls.NC has forged an alliance with Congress for the polls to the 90 assembly seats. Addressing a rally in Ganderbal assembly segment from where he is contesting, Omar referred to remarks by Amit Shah in Jammu, claiming the Union home minister was “silent” on Apni Party and People’s Conference during his speech at BJP’s manifesto launch on Friday.“Those who have struck a deal with Delhi will not fulfill your demands. If you need evidence, just look at the statement of Shah. The home minister listed the parties with which BJP will not form the govt. He was, however, silent about Independents because they are hand in glove (with them). He was silent on Apni Party and People’s Conference,” Omar said.The former CM even sought to cast doubts on Awami Ittehad Party (AIP), led by jailed MP Engineer Rashid who had defeated Omar in the Baramulla seat in this summer’s Lok Sabha polls. Omar pointed out that Shah had not included AIP among the parties with which BJP would have no truck. “I thought he (Shah) would at least name the party of Engineer Rashid but he did not,” Omar told the rally.Omar’s remarks came on a day both Rasheed’s AIP and the Sajad Lone-led People’s Conference unveiled their manifestos.People’s Conference promised to continue fighting for restoration of J&K’s special status under Article 370 and statehood by supporting “efforts within and outside legislative forums”. Another key element was a pledge for a judicial commission to probe alleged rigging in the 1987 assembly polls when NC was in office. The rigging-marred elections were widely believed to have ignited militancy in J&K the next few years.Rasheed’s AIP vowed release of all jailed Valley youths and efforts to revoke laws like Public Safety Act (PSA) and UAPA. Most of the youths have been jailed under the two stringent acts. Another key AIP promise was to restore the Darbar Move under which J&K had two capitals earlier --- Jammu in winter and Srinagar in summer. The decades-old practice was stopped after the Aug 2019 abrogation of special status.","NC has forged an alliance with Congress for the polls to the 90 assembly seats.

Rahul said it taught him ""the beauty of silence"", with the power to tune out the noise and listen to the person next to him, as he did during his 145 days footmarch.Awaited now is 'Bharat Dojo Yatra', that Rahul recently announced while sharing a video of martial arts sessions held at campsites of BJY, and explaining 'Dojo' as a training site.","The 4,000 km padyatra from Kanyakumari to Kashmir started on Sept 7, 2022, which then led to East to West Yatra in 2024 ahead of the elections.

It collapsed on Aug 26.Apte's lawyer, Ganesh Sovani, claimed he surrendered because he was fed up with ""dirty politics"".""The allegations levelled against him are false. He spoke to his wife on Wednesday, who asked him to surrender. We then informed police,"" he said. Police, however, claimed that they arrested him on the basis of specific information.Patil had surrendered before police in Kolhapur last week.

Wrestlers’ entry into politics

NEW DELHI: A day after wrestler Vinesh Phogat joined Congress, former Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) president and BJP leader Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh questioned the legitimacy of Phogat's participation in the Paris Olympic games, saying that ‘God punished’ her for going to games by ‘ cheating ’.Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh said to ANI, ""Is it not true that Bajrang went to the Asian Games without trials? I want to ask those who are experts in wrestling.I want to ask Vinesh Phogat whether a player can give trials in 2 weight categories in a day?”He added, “Can the trials be stopped for 5 hours after the weigh-in? You did not win the wrestling, you went there by cheating. God has punished you for the same.”Singh strongly rejected claims of sexual misconduct and said that it was in fact Phogat and fellow wrestler Bajrang Punia who caused ""embarrassment to daughters"".Refuting allegations of misconduct, Singh said, ""I am not guilty of disrespecting daughters. If anyone is guilty of disrespecting daughters, it is Bajrang and Vinesh. And the one who wrote the script, Bhupinder Hooda, is responsible for that,""Singh further alleged that the wrestlers' protest against him was not for the dignity of women but a political plot.""I want to tell the people of Haryana that Bhupinder Hooda, Deepender Hooda, Bajrang, and Vinesh were not sitting (on protest) for the dignity of girls. Due to them, the daughters of Haryana are facing embarrassment. We are not responsible for it, Bhupinder Hooda and Deependra Hooda and these protesters are responsible for it,"" the former WFI chief said.He accused the Congress party of orchestrating the protests against him to discredit the ruling BJP and manipulate public opinion.Attacking the Congress, Singh said, ""From the beginning, I claimed that the protests were not a genuine movement by sportspersons but a Congress-led initiative. Bhupinder Hooda and his party were behind this entire conspiracy.""He maintained that the wrestlers' grievances were a pretext to achieve political goals rather than a genuine fight for women's rights.Current President of the WFI Sanjay Singh backed Bhushan and accused the wrestlers of conspiring against the wrestling community, saying, ""This protest was bound to happen as it was orchestrated by Congress.""He claimed that the protest disrupted wrestling activities, potentially impacting India's performance in international competitions.“This entire conspiracy was also hatched because 4-5 wrestling medals were going to come in the Olympics. The protest also affected those medals. There was no wrestling activity for 2 years in the Olympic year, so due to that, we got fewer medals. Our wrestlers were not able to practice... Now these people are not going to have any impact on our wrestling association,” Sanjay Singh added.Wrestlers Phogat and Punia officially joined the Congress party on Friday, just before the Haryana assembly elections. Both wrestlers resigned from their positions with Northern Railways earlier that day.Phogat, the first Indian woman wrestler to reach an Olympic final, was immediately fielded as a candidate for the Julana constituency, while Punia, a bronze medalist from the Tokyo Olympics, was appointed the working president of the All India Kisan Congress.","Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh questioned the legitimacy of Vinesh Phogat's participation in the Paris Olympic games, saying that ‘God punished’ her for going to games by ‘ cheating ’ Singh strongly rejected claims of sexual misconduct and said that it was in fact PhogAt and fellow wrestler Bajrang Punia who caused ""embarrassment to daughters""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113145054,imgsize-1649589,width-400,resizemode-4/113145054.jpg"
