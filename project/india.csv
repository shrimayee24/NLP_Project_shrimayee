NEW DELHI: Terming Congress the ""proud flagbearer"" of the national song, Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge Friday said ' Vande Mataram ', which was first publicly sung by Rabindranath Tagore at Congress session in 1896, awakened the collective soul of the nation and became the rallying cry for the freedom struggle.He alleged RSS never accepted the song and has stuck to its ""Namaste Sada Vatsale"" despite the national song's universal reverence. Kharge said the song echoed across the land from the Partition of Bengal in 1905 to the last breaths of the country's brave revolutionaries, and terrified the British into banning it.He recalled that Mahatma Gandhi in 1915 wrote that 'Vande Mataram' had become the ""most powerful battle cry among Hindus and Musalmans of Bengal during the Partition days"", while Jawaharlal Nehru said in 1938 that ""for more than 30 years now, the song is related directly to Indian nationalism.""Kharge claimed the UP assembly started reciting 'Vande Mataram' in 1937.

‘NDA Will Form Govt Again Under Nitish Kumar’s Leadership’: Bihar Dy CM Vijay Sinha Ahead Of Polls

Caste arithmetic in Gaura Bauram



Total electorate:

Estimated blocs:

VIP counts on consolidation in the end

A peculiar contest has emerged in Darbhanga’s Gaura Bauram constituency. Amid uncertainty and confusion during seat-sharing within the Mahagathbandhan, RJD had initially allotted the ticket to Afzal Ali Khan. Later, the seat was handed over to Mukesh Sahni’s VIP. Sahni then fielded his younger brother Santosh Sahni from here but Afzal Ali refused to withdraw. Treating this as indiscipline, RJD yesterday expelled Afzal Ali for six years with immediate effect.This sets up a potential split in the Muslim vote between Afzal Ali and Santosh Sahni, this could end up benefiting the BJP.BJP has fielded former IRS officer Sujeet Kumar Singh. His wife Swarna Singh had won from here in the previous election on VIP’s ticket, but later joined BJP. The seat has a sizeable Mallah population, the reason Mukesh Sahni had originally demanded it for himself but eventually nominated his younger brother.RJD insists that Santosh Sahni is the authorised Mahagathbandhan candidate. But on paper, Afzal Ali continues to remain the nominated nominee — something that could complicate Santosh’s prospects. Afzal Ali had lost by barely 7,000 votes the last time when he contested on RJD’s ticket.2.65 lakhMuslim 70k, Yadav 28k, Mallah 26k, Brahmin 33k, Vaishya 20k, Paswan 15k, other SC 25k.BJP’s Sujeet Kumar Singh is from the Rajput community, which is not numerically dominant here. However, he believes he can ride on the BJP’s core vote base plus Mahagathbandhan’s internal rebellion.Speaking to us, he claimed that barring Muslims, every caste group is voting for me. He also claimed a large chunk of Yadavs are backing him. Singh resigned from the IRS only a week before receiving the BJP ticket and believes his “education and clean image” will work as an added advantage.VIP spokesperson Dev Jyoti said within 24 hours of Afzal Ali’s expulsion, the “wind has swung” in VIP’s favour. He expressed confidence that Muslim voters, at the end of the day, will back the candidate best placed to defeat the BJP. He also said the backing of Lalu Prasad Yadav and Tejashwi Yadav is firmly with VIP here.However, some minority voters argue that since RJD had already issued the nomination earlier, Mukesh Sahni shouldn’t have disturbed the seat.","BJP has fielded former IRS officer Sujeet Kumar Singh.

"18 years after acquittal, SC revives case against ex-Chhattisgarh CM's son",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/18-years-after-acquittal-sc-revives-case-against-ex-chhattisgarh-cms-son/articleshow/125174103.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: Murder case of a Nationalist Congress Party functionary of Chhattisgarh will again haunt Amit Jogi, son of former chief minister Ajit Jogi, as Supreme Court on Thursday revived the case against him, 18 years after his acquittal.The murder of NCP's Ramavatar Jaggi took place in 2003 and it was alleged that the conspiracy was hatched at the CM's residence as his father was governing the state at that time. The case was transferred to CBI and trial court acquitted him in 2007 while convicting 20 other accused. The state, thereafter, filed the appeal in HC. CBI also moved HC but after a delay of almost 1,400 days, challenging his acquittal.But HC rejected the plea of state govt as well as CBI on different grounds, virtually bringing the case against Jogi to an end. Rejecting the appeal of state, HC had said that the case was being probed by the central agency and the state had no locus in appeal. It also said that the appeal by CBI was filed by inordinate delay of 1,373 days and refused to condone the delay. The state and CBI thereafter moved SC.Allowing the plea of CBI, a bench of Justices Vikram Nath, Sanjay Karol and Sandeep Mehta said the case was sensitive and HC should have taken a more liberal and pragmatic approach in dealing with CBI's applicatio.Court condoned the delay, paving way for HC to examine appeal against Jogi's acquittal in 2007.CBI urged that the delay was bona fide; and as it was under an impression that the state had filed an appeal against the acquittal and it was not considered necessary for CBI to challenge the acquittal. It said the agency moved the HC when locus of the state to file the leave to appeal was questioned.Allowing CBI's plea, the bench said, ""Though CBI filed an application seeking leave to appeal after a significant delay of 1,373 days, it is equally true that the charges against the respondent, Amit Jogi, were grave, involving conspiracy to murder a member of a rival political party. The judgment of acquittal was under challenge at the instance of the state govt and the de-facto complainant and thus, the proceedings were still alive. Therefore, we are of the opinion that HC ought to have adopted a more liberal and pragmatic approach in dealing with CBI's application seeking condonation of delay and should have examined application seeking leave to appeal applicable on its merits"".""We may hasten to add that we are not giving any imprimatur to the explanation offered by CBI in its application for condonation of delay, but our objective is to ensure that the case involving such grave allegations should not be thrown out on mere technicalities,"" it said. The court remitted the matter to HC for fresh consideration of the application for grant of leave to appeal filed by CBI, on merit.","Court condoned the delay, paving way for HC to examine appeal against Jogi's acquittal in 2007.

NEW DELHI: Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi on Friday launched a sharp attack at the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Election Commission, alleging large-scale electoral malpractice and claiming that Prime Minister Narendra Modi “became the PM through chunav chori. ”Speaking to reporters in Delhi, Rahul said his party had gathered extensive evidence to expose what he described as a pattern of election manipulation. “We have a lot of material, we will continue this process. We will clearly show India's GenZ and youth that Narendra Modi became the PM through 'chunav chori' and BJP indulges in 'chunav chori',” he said.Referring to recent reports of a BJP leader allegedly casting votes at two different locations, Rahul claimed that electoral fraud was not isolated but systematic. “I gave a presentation that Haryana elections were not elections at all. A 'wholesale chori' occurred there. There was no response by the EC to the allegations levelled by me – fake vote, fake photograph,” he said.According to Rahul, the BJP’s defence of the incident without denial only reinforced his charge. “BJP is defending this but not negating what I said. Media is picking up small examples, like a Brazilian woman voted.How was voting done on the photo of a Brazilian national?” he asked.The Congress leader went on to accuse the Prime Minister, home minister Amit Shah, and the Election Commission of jointly undermining the Constitution. “The reality is that Narendra Modi ji, Amit Shah ji and EC are attacking the Constitution together. Constitution says 'One man, one vote'. Haryana shows that there was no 'One man, one vote' there. It was 'One man, multiple votes',” he said.He alleged that the same pattern of electoral malpractice was being repeated across states. “They are going to do the same in Bihar. It happened in MP, Chhattisgarh, Haryana and Gujarat,” he said, adding that his party would continue to raise the issue to “protect the Constitution and the people’s vote.”The Election Commission has not yet responded to Rahul Gandhi’s latest allegations. The BJP, meanwhile, has dismissed earlier claims by the Congress leader as politically motivated attempts to discredit the electoral process.","Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi alleges large-scale electoral malpractice.
