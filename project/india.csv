BJP Labels Congress ‘New Muslim League’ for Backing Places of Worship Act,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-calls-congress-new-muslim-league-for-backing-shrines-act/articleshow/117342132.cms,"Poll Is Political Rhetoric Around Religion a Cause for Concern? No, It’s Part of Democratic Discourse Yes, It Fosters Division

NEW DELHI: BJP Friday said Congress moving Supreme Court in support of the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act was a declaration of ""open war against Hindus"" and the party was now the ""new Muslim League "". ""Congress has approached SC seeking to deny Hindus their fundamental constitutional right to legal remedies for addressing historical injustices. It has urged the top court to dismiss petitions challenging the Places of Worship Act , 1991, under the pretext of 'safeguarding secularism',"" BJP's IT department head Amit Malviya said on X.BJP had opposed the Places of Worship Act right since the Narasimha Rao-led govt's move to enact it in the face of the movement for construction of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. The bill, passed amid vehement opposition from BJP, sought to freeze the character of all places of worship, save the disputed site in Ayodhya, as it existed on Aug 15, 1947. It was meant to pre-empt a Sangh Parivar bid for Varanasi's Gyanvapi mosque and Mathura's Shahi Eidgah.But this is a first in recent times that BJP has reiterated its stance: something which raises the excitement over the stand the Centre might take in SC over the law.Congress has moved SC to oppose pleas challenging the Act claiming that it is violative of Articles 14 (equality before law and equal protection), Article 15 (prohibition of discrimination on the ground of religion), Article 25 (right to profess and practice one's religion), Article 26 (right of a community to manage their religious affairs) and Article 29 (protection of cultural rights of citizens) as well as on the basis of the argument that neither Hindu law nor Shariat allows for construction of mosques on sites of temples that were destroyed by invaders.The petitioners and Sangh Parivar have maintained that the Varanasi mosque was built after demolishing the legendary Kashi Vishwanath Mandir, site of one of the 12 Jyotirlings, and the Mathura Eidgah has come up on the birthplace of Lord Krishna.BJP's stand is interesting also because of RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat's caution that there was no need to look for temples under every mosque - a stand which has been rejected by prominent Hindu religious figures and appears to be at odds with Uttar Pradesh govt's effort to ""reclaim"" properties and temples belonging to Hindus which they were forced to abandon after losing many lives in the 1978 riots.""Congress consented to India's Partition along religious lines. Following this, it introduced the Waqf law, enabling Muslims to claim properties at will and establish mini-Pakistans across the country. It later enacted the Places of Worship Act, effectively denying Hindus the right to reclaim their historical and religious sites. Now, Congress has declared an open war against Hindus,"" Malviya said.Congress moved SC in support of the Places of Worship Act and said the law was ""essential to safeguard secularism in India"" which was a basic feature of the Constitution and was needed to ensure communal harmony .","Congress moving Supreme Court in support of Places of Worship Act is a declaration of ""open war against Hindus,"" says BJP.

'Revadi vs khairat vs prasad vs development': War of words between AAP and BJP over election manifesto for Delhi polls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/revadi-vs-khairat-vs-prasad-vs-development-war-of-words-between-aap-and-bjp-over-election-manifesto-for-delhi-polls/articleshow/117332266.cms,"'PM Modi should say that freebies prasad by God for country'



'Kejriwal, when you speak, it seems you are distributing khairat'



NEW DELHI: A war of words erupted between the Aam Aadmi Party chief and the Bharatiya Janata Party shortly after the saffron party released its freebie packed manifesto for the upcoming Delhi elections.With the AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal calling out on Prime Minister Narendra Modi to accept that free handouts are good for development to BJP chief Virendraa Sachdeva explaining the former difference between ""revadi and development"", the two parties attacked each other for resorting to appeasement politics.Targeting PM Modi, who has warned against ""revadi culture"" at several occasions, Arvind Kejriwal questioned BJP's free handout schemes announced in the manifesto.""...Today, BJP's national president announced that they too would offer 'free ki revri' like Kejriwal did...So, I would like to tell him - Prime Minister should come forward and announce specifically that he agrees with this and he should say that what Modi ji said earlier was wrong,"" he said.""PM Modi said so far that freebies are not good. He should now say that he was wrong and Kejriwal was right. PM Modi should say that freebies are not harmful to the country but 'prasad' by God...,"" he added.BJP's manifesto promises free gas cylinders on Holi and Diwali, Rs 21,000 for pregnant women, Rs 2,500 to every woman every month, among others.On BJP's decision to continue with the current welfare schemes, Kejriwal said that the party had openly admitted that Delhi government's schemes were positively impacting not only the general public but also the families of BJP members.""BJP has openly accepted that Kejriwal is running many welfare schemes in Delhi which are benefiting the families of BJP members also. We don't know how to do politics, we know how to work. And we do such work that even our opponents praise it,"" he said.Hitting back at Kejriwal, BJP Delhi chief Virendraa Sachdeva said that when the former CM speaks, it seems he is talking about distributing ""khairat (charity)"". At the same time, ""when we speak, the PM speaks or our national president speaks, we speak of the overall development of the entire society,"" he said.""A criminal who is out on bail - Arvind Kejriwal would not be able to understand the difference between 'revadi' and development, the difference between freebies and empowerment, the difference between freebies and prosperity, the difference between 'revadi' and 'sankalp',"" he said.""Arvind Kejriwal, when you speak, it seems you are distributing 'khairat' and when we speak, the PM speaks or our national president speaks, we speak of the overall development of the entire society..,"" he added.","BJP's manifesto promises free gas cylinders on Holi and Diwali, Rs 21,000 for pregnant women, Rs 2,500 to every woman every month, among others.

It has recommended reforms to ensure that the PM can face a no-confidence motion in parliament.To prevent the concentration of power in the hands of an individual or institution, it has proposed the creation of a constitutional body - national constitutional council (NCC) - to establish a system of checks and balances between the three branches of the state and the two executive positions - PM and president.This council would include the president, chief justice, PM, leaders of opposition of both houses, speakers and deputy speakers from the opposition, and a representative of other parties. The commission has recommended decentralising the judiciary by maintaining the unitary structure of Supreme Court, while establishing permanent high court benches with jurisdiction in all divisional cities.It has also provided a framework for an interim govt to be formed after the dissolution of parliament, and recommended that selection of advisers to such govts should be solely the NCC's responsibility.",The Constitution Reform Commission has recommended introducing a two-term limit on the PM's tenure.

They had previously been sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment in the case, which SC termed ""malicious"".Following the verdict, there are now no legal barriers preventing the two-time former PM from contesting the upcoming national elections. Khaleda and her son are currently residing in London.SC overturned the judgments delivered during the regime of ousted PM Sheikh Hasina by the high court and trial court. The trial court had sentenced Khaleda to five years' imprisonment, while Tarique and the other accused received 10 years each. Later, HC doubled Khaleda's sentence to 10 years while upholding trial court's verdict for the other accused.In its ruling, SC observed that the prosecution of the Zia Orphanage Trust case was ""malicious"" and noted that the accused, who did not appeal the HC verdict, would also benefit from this judgment ""restoring their dignity as innocent individuals"".A five-member bench of the appellate division, led by Chief Justice Syed Refaat Ahmed, delivered the unanimous verdict. The ruling came after hearings on two appeals filed by Khaleda and individual appeals made by Kazi Kamal and businessman Sharafuddin Ahmed. Khaleda had initially been jailed on Feb 8, 2018 after a special court in Dhaka sentenced her to five years in prison for her involvement in the case. The other accused - Kazi Kamal, Sharafuddin, Kamal Uddin Siddique and Mominur Rahman - were sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment for misappropriating over BDT 2.1 crore, which was intended as foreign grants for orphans.","Khaleda Zia, her son and BNP acting chairman Tarique Rahman were acquitted on Wednesday by the appellate division of Bangladesh Supreme Court.
