'Is CM so helpless': Bombay HC raps Maharashtra government; Sena minister's son evades arrest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/is-cm-so-helpless-bombay-hc-raps-maharashtra-government-sena-ministers-son-evades-arrest/articleshow/127181472.cms,"“Democracy Sliding Into ICU”: Opposition Targets BJP As BMC Polls Trigger Political Storm

NEW DELHI: The Bombay high court on Thursday came down sharply on the Maharashtra government, questioning whether the rule of law prevails in the state and asking if the chief minister was too ""helpless"" to act against a cabinet minister whose son has been evading arrest for weeks.The remarks were made by Justice Madhav Jamdar while hearing applications linked to a violent clash during the Mahad Municipal Council elections in Raigad district, news agency PTI reported.The case involves Vikas Gogawale, son of Shiv Sena minister Bharat Gogawale, and Shreeyansh Jagtap, son of former MLA Manik Jagtap and a leader of the NCP.Violence had erupted on December 2 during the civic polls between supporters of the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena and the Ajit Pawar-led NCP, both allies in the BJP-led government. Cross FIRs were registered following the clash.Vikas Gogawale and his cousin Mahesh, key accused in the case, were denied pre-arrest bail, while Shreeyansh Jagtap was granted interim protection from arrest in December. Applications opposing Jagtap’s anticipatory bail were filed by Vikas and Mahesh Gogawale.Taking note of the police’s failure to arrest the minister’s son after his anticipatory bail plea was rejected by a sessions court, Justice Jamdar asked, ""Is the state’s chief minister so helpless that he cannot say anything against even one minister? Ministers’ children commit crimes and roam freely ... they remain in touch with their parents, yet the police cannot find them?”The judge added that while there may be pressure on the police, “there is no pressure on the court,” and questioned whether law and order was being effectively enforced.Following the court’s rebuke, the government assured compliance. Advocate General Milind Sathe told the bench that the minister would ensure his son’s surrender within a day. The court accepted the assurance, directed Vikas Gogawale to surrender before the next hearing, and posted the matter for Friday."," Bombay high court questions whether rule of law prevails in Maharashtra.

‘Protecting Rohingyas And Bangladeshis’: BJP MP Sambit Patra Slams Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission on Thursday directed to register an FIR against Trinamool Congress MLA Monirul Islam for alleged vandalism at the Farakka Block Development Office (BDO) in West Bengal last week.The poll body asked the district administration to file the FIR by 5 pm, after observing that an earlier case did not name the MLA.A senior Election Commission official said Islam, accompanied by supporters, had staged a protest outside the Farakka BDO office against alleged “harassment of the public” during the SIR exercise, following which the office was vandalised.The Commission took cognisance of the incident and spoke to West Bengal Director General of Police Rajeev Kumar, directing that an FIR be lodged.While an FIR was initially registered, it did not name the local MLA as an accused, prompting the EC to order a fresh FIR specifically naming Islam, as reported by news agency PTI.According to the official, the unrest was triggered by protests from a section of Booth Level Officers (BLOs), who alleged that citizens were being harassed during the SIR process.The situation escalated when protesters led by the MLA marched to the BDO office, raising slogans against the exercise and the protest allegedly turned violent.The incident dates back to June 14, when the Farakka BDO office in Murshidabad district was allegedly raided during an ongoing SIR hearing.A written complaint filed by BDO Junaid Ahamed stated that around 1.30 pm, a group of unidentified individuals stormed multiple official rooms and vandalised government property in the presence of BLOs, the Joint BDO, the OC Election and other Assistant Electoral Registration Officers (AEROs). During the chaos, one AERO reportedly sustained injuries while trying to protect himself.A case was registered at the Farakka police station under multiple sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) and the Prevention of Damage to Public Property (PDPP) Act and two arrests were made.The incident also triggered sharp political reactions. BJP MLA Gouri Sankar accused TMC MLA Monirul Islam of leading the vandalism and targeted chief minister Mamata Banerjee over the violence.Speaking to ANI, Sankar said, “Today, Farakka MLA Manirul Islam vandalised the block office. How can a public representative vandalise property? Who gave him the right to do so? Are they not Indian citizens, or are they Bangladeshis who think they can vandalise a block office in India?”He added, “The public is ready to give them a befitting reply. In the 2026 elections, whether it’s Manirul or someone else, they will get their answer from the public.”The BJP further alleged that the violence was politically instigated. “Mamata Banerjee is instigating her party cadres across the state to riot, commit violence, and destroy property. All these actions are carried out under Mamata Banerjee’s instructions,” the party said, alleging that corruption and destruction in the state occurred under the chief minister’s watch.","Election Commission directed to register an FIR against Trinamool Congress MLA Monirul Islam.

NEW DELHI: Taking exception to Bengal govt’s decision to unilaterally exonerate Baruipur Purba assembly constituency assistant electoral registration officer (AERO) Tathagata Mondal and impose only a minor penalty against Moyna AC AERO Sudipta Das — despite clear instructions by Election Commission (dated 05.08.2025) to suspend and initiate disciplinary proceedings against them — EC Wednesday asked the state chief secretary to get the competent authority to submit to the commission a written explanation for the “procedural lapse”.The explanation — sought by 5pm on Jan 24 — must detail the circumstances that led to non-compliance with the commission’s instructions, which had mandated that disciplinary authorities shall consult EC before closing or finalising any matter arising out of disciplinary proceedings initiated on the poll panel’s recommendation.“Since the disciplinary proceedings have been finalised without adherence to the prescribed procedure and without mandatory consultation with the Commission, the Commission does not accept such finalisation of disciplinary action. Accordingly, the same shall be treated as procedurally irregular and non est in the eyes of the Commission, warranting reconsideration,” EC said in the letter sent to the state chief secretary.As part of the explanation sought by EC, the competent authority has been asked to furnish the complete disciplinary case records, including the articles of charge, written statements of defence, inquiry reports, findings of the inquiry authority, orders of the disciplinary authority, file notings and all other relevant records forming the basis of the disciplinary action taken in respect of four officials, namely Tathagata Mondal, Debottam Dutta Choudhury, Biplab Sarkar and Sudipta Das.The commission had directed the state govt to suspend and initiate suitable disciplinary proceedings against the EROs/AEROs concerned and lodge FIRs against the erring officials, including the contractual data entry operator, under Section 32 of the RP Act, 1950, read with the relevant provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, and Information Technology Act, 2000. Sources said they were allegedly disposing of applications for inclusion in the electoral roll without proper verification or allowing a window for filing claims and objections.",Bengal govt unilaterally exonerate Baruipur Purba assembly constituency assistant electoral registration officer (AERO) Tathagata Mondal and impose only a minor penalty against Moyna AC AERO Sudipta Das.
