Modi may be keen to rope in Chirag; several new faces from BJP also likely

NEW DELHI: As the buzz about allies seeking to secure a higher share of berths and high-profile portfolios in Modi 3.0 govt persisted on Saturday, there were indications of the BJP leadership asking NDA partners to 'pare down' their demands to 'reasonable limits' while assuring that unfulfilled desires may be given due consideration at an appropriate time later.Sources said none of the crucial ministries, including the four represented on the Cabinet committee on security - home, defence, finance and external affairs - are on the table. BJP is also likely to keep education, parliamentary affairs, culture and I&B, while ensuring that the Speaker is from its own ranks.Allies may have representation of 12-15 ministers and talks are also under way with Shiromani Akali Dal.TDP (16 MPs) and JD-U (12) have been asked to settle for a Cabinet berth and a junior minister slot. Shiv Sena (7) and LJP (5) have each been offered a Cabinet berth. RLD (2 MPs) chief Jayant Chaudhary is expected to be part of the Cabinet. Although the BJP brass is keen to accommodate Pawan Kalyan, founder of Jana Sena (2), it's not clear whether the willingness will extend to his colleagues if the Telugu cine star refuses to shift to Delhi. Sources said a call on Jana Sena's representation may be taken in consultation with TDP boss and Kalyan's ally N Chandrababu Naidu.BJP's old ally Anupriya Patel, the Apna Dal chief who served as a minister in the earlier Modi dispensations, is seen as a certainty.The claims of both Jitan Ram Manjhi, former Bihar CM who is the sole representative of Hindustan Awam Morcha, the Mahadalit outfit that he founded, as well as NCP for Cabinet berths are considered to be strong, and will be settled by Narendra Modi.While those involved in negotiations were tight-lipped, sources said three-term Srikakulam MP Ram Mohan Naidu could be a probable for the Cabinet berth from TDP's quota. Though only 34, Naidu, son of former Cabinet minister, the late Yerran Naidu, and nephew of TDP's AP unit chief Kinjarapu Atchannaidu, is seen as a rising OBC face. Chandrasekhar Pemmasani, a doctor from the Kamma community with assets of over Rs 5,000 crore who has been elected from Guntur, could be the party's choice for the junior minister berth.Former JD(U) president Rajiv Ranjan Singh 'Lallan' and Bihar CM Nitish Kumar's confidant Sanjay Jha are considered favourites for the Cabinet berth, in that order.Although Rajiv Ranjan Singh is senior, former Bihar water resources minister Sanjay Jha is also a strong contender. Besides chief minister Nitish Kumar's trust, he also enjoys goodwill in BJP for the role he played in facilitating JD(U)'s return to NDA.For the junior minister berth, JD(U) is likely to consider someone from the MBC bloc, an important constituency for the party. Rajya Sabha member Ramnath Thakur, whose father, the late Karpoori Thakur, was awarded a Bharat Ratna by the Modi govt, is likely to get the nod, although the party has an array of choices to pick from.For the Shiv Sena quota, it is likely to be a toss-up between Shrirang Barne, the three-term winner from Maval, and Prataprao Jadhav, the winner from Buldhana, while Modi may be keen to bring in Chirag Paswan, whose claim to be the legatee of his father, late Dalit leader Ram Vilas Paswan, has been fortified with LJP sweeping the five seats allotted to it.Modi's choices are being looked forward to also for the clues they may offer regarding his response to the setback that the party suffered in Uttar Pradesh and elsewhere and the success of the opposition's claims that BJP was anti-Dalit and had sought a super majority to change the Constitution to scrap caste quotas.While the suspense over inductions from among allies is expected to end on Sunday evening, when the swearing-in is scheduled, speculation over ministry-making may persist until the portfolios are announced. Whether the portfolios of CCS ministers are going to be shuffled remains a matter of intense discussion in political and bureaucratic circles which are also waiting with keen anticipation for the picks for crucial positions like principal secretary, cabinet secretary, foreign secretary, home secretary, Army chief, ED director and SBI chairman.Likely assignments for former chief ministers like Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Manohar Lal Khattar will also have a bearing on the pecking order and indicate their standing, besides being a pointer to the govt's priorities.Several new faces from BJP are also expected, with over 20 of the 71 ministers having lost the elections.",TDP (16 MPs) and JD-U (12) have been asked to settle for a Cabinet berth and a junior minister slot.

"4-member panel to review NEET-UG results of 1,563 candidates",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/4-member-panel-to-review-neet-ug-results-of-1563-candidate/articleshow/110825527.cms,"NEW DELHI: The ministry of education has constituted a four-member panel headed by a former Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) chairperson to review the grace marks awarded to more than 1,563 candidates in the medical entrance exam National Eligibility Entrance Test-undergraduate ( NEET-UG ). This was informed by the National Testing Agency ( NTA ) announced on Saturday.The medical/ dental entrance test results were announced on June 4, and thereafter aspirants have been alleging multiple issues, including irregularities in the exam demanding fresh examination. - Meanwhile, Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, the student wing affiliated to the RSS, on Saturday demanded a CBI inquiry into the allegations on the NEET-UG.Many aspirants have also approached courts for relief on the matter. Meanwhile a political slugfest commenced between AAP and BJP on the exams which recorded over 24 lakh registration and 97% attendance. Earlier Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra criticised the government on purported irregularities in the medical entrance examination demanding a thorough investigation.According to NTA officials, the four-member panel is being mandated to submit its recommendations within a week and the results of these candidates might be revised accordingly.The move comes amid allegations of inflation of marks leading to 67 candidates sharing first rank in the exam including six from the same centre in Haryana.Demanding re-exam candidates are alleging that the grace marks awarded to make up for the loss of time at six exam centres have led to the inflation of marks and tampered with the chances of other candidates. These centres are from Meghalaya, Bahadurgarh in Haryana, Dantewada and Balodh in Chhattisgarh, Surat in Gujarat and Chandigarh.“A high-powered committee has been set up to review the results of over 1,563 candidates. The four-member panel headed by a former UPSC chairman will submit its recommendations within a week and the results of these candidates might be revised,” said Subodh Kumar Singh, director general, NTA.Singh added, “The awarding of grace marks has not impacted the qualifying criteria of the exam and the review of results of the affected candidates will not impact the admission process.”The issue also took political turn with several opposition parties raising the issue. While AAP demanded a Supreme Court-monitored SIT probe into the alleged irregularities, Congress alleged paper leaks, rigging and corruption have become an integral part of many examinations and accused the BJP of cheating youngsters and playing with their futures. The Congress in Kerala alleged that results have raised concerns about the authenticity of the national exam for medical courses, with many students casting doubt on the procedure.Responding to AAP’s allegations, Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor questioned that “The people of Delhi want to know how minister Atishi took credit for the 100% results of Delhi's six specialized excellence schools in the NEET exam, while today Jasmine Shah called the emergence of six toppers from a centre in Jhajjar, Haryana, a scam?”The NTA however, denied any irregularities and said the changes made in the NCERT textbooks and grace marks for losing time at the examination centres were some of the reasons behind the students scoring higher marks.On whether the exam will be re-conducted for certain students, Singh said: “It will be decided depending upon the committee’s recommendations. The idea is to ensure that students who lost time or other students are not at any disadvantage,” while denying any paper leak and irregularities in the exam and reiterated that the integrity of the crucial test had been compromised.ABVP in a statement said that irregularities were reported on the very day of the examination from different parts of the country and solvers were caught at different places, and at some places irregularities were also found in the distribution of question papers etc. Vidyarthi Parishad stands with the legitimate demands of the NEET candidates. ABVP's national general secretary Yagyavalkya Shukla said that there is suspicion of irregularities among the candidates regarding the NEET-UG exam results, this entire episode should be investigated by CBI and strict action should be taken against the culprits.","The ministry of education has constituted a four-member panel to review the grace marks awarded to more than 1,563 candidates.

NEW DELHI: Narendra Modi will take oath as India's Prime Minister on Sunday for the third time at the Rashtrapati Bhawan . The oath-taking ceremony of Modi and his cabinet will be held in the presence of a large gathering of national and international dignitaries. On Friday, the President of India appointed Modi as the prime minister-designate after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief JP Nadda presented her with a letter regarding Modi's election as the leader of the BJP Parliamentary Party. Notably, NDA leaders also submitted their letters of support. The President will administer the oath of office and secrecy to the Prime Minister and other members of the Union Council of Ministers at 7.15 pm.The spotlight remains on allies N Chandrababu Naidu and Nitish Kumar who have played an impactful role in the government formation of the NDA for the third as the BJP failed to get to the majority mark on its own. Naidu with 16 MPs and Nitish Kumar with 12 hold ace up their sleeves and are expected to bag plum posts in the NDA government. The BJP, however, is expected to keep key portfolios with itself.Meanwhile, the INDIA Bloc has claimed that the Opposition leaders have not received invites for the swearing-in ceremony . Congress general secretary KC Venugopal claimed they have not received any information from the government requesting them to attend Narendra Modi's swearing-in ceremony.“So far we have not received any information from the government. We have not received any invitation...foreign leaders have been invited. Being the principal opposition party and the INDIA bloc leadership, we have not been informed. I do not know what the mood of the government is,” the senior leader said.The swearing-in ceremony will be attended by leaders from India’s neighbourhood and Indian Ocean region.They include the President of Sri Lanka Ranil Wickremesinghe, vice president of Seychelles Ahmed Afif, Prime Minister of Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina, Prime Minister of Mauritius Pravind Kumar Jugnauth, Prime Minister of Nepal Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’ and Prime Minister of Bhutan Tshering Tobgay.Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu will also attend the ceremony amid strained ties. Accepting the invite, he said he would be honoured to attend the swearing-in ceremony and his visit to India for the historic event would demonstrate that bilateral ties between the two countries are heading in a positive direction. Like 2019, India has not sent an official invite to Pakistan this time.In addition to participating in the swearing-in ceremony, the leaders will attend a Banquet hosted by President Droupadi Murmu at Rashtrapati Bhavan, on the same evening.The visit of the leaders to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi for his third consecutive term is in keeping with the highest priority accorded by India to its ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy and ‘SAGAR’ vision.The Rashtrapati Bhawan will be under a five-layered security blanket on June 9 for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's swearing-in ceremony. The security measures will include paramilitary personnel, NSG commandoes, drones, and snipers. As dignitaries from SAARC nations have been invited, Delhi will remain on high alert.Designated routes will be provided to the attending dignitaries for their travel between their hotels and the venue. Top leaders from Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, Bhutan, Nepal, Mauritius, and Seychelles are expected to attend the ceremony. Several hotels in the city, such as Leela, Taj, ITC Maurya, Claridges, and Oberoi, are already under security cover.The President's house and various strategic locations will have SWAT and NSG commandoes deployed.

Electoral setbacks and BJP’s strategic win

Uncertain future for Kamal Nath and Congress

Indira ke do haath, Sanjay aur Kamal Nath

NEW DELHI: Kamal Nath, the former chief minister and a prominent Congress leader in Madhya Pradesh , is now facing challenges following two consecutive electoral defeats. These setbacks, including the defeat of his son Nakul Nath in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections from the Chhindwara seat and his own failure to secure the people’s mandate in the 2023 assembly polls diminished his political stature in the state despite his long-standing influence and strong candidacy. Nakul Nath’s loss by a margin of 113,618 votes in a constituency historically dominated by the Nath family underscores the declining support for Kamal Nath and the Congress party in a region that was once their stronghold.A series of recent events have weakened Nath's control over the Congress party in Madhya Pradesh. In a significant development, former minister and close ally Deepak Saxena left the Congress party on March 22, coinciding with his son Ajay Saxena's defection to the BJP along with 400 other Congress members from Nath’s stronghold of Chhindwara.Further compounding Nath's troubles, six corporators from his camp defected to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), adding to the ongoing political turbulence in the state. This defection coincided with the 'Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra,' led by Congress MP Rahul Gandhi, which aimed to unify and energize the party base.In the recent Lok Sabha elections, Kamal Nath’s influence in Chhindwara was critically undermined when his son Nakul Nath lost by a notable margin. Chhindwara, a seat historically dominated by the Nath family, fell to the BJP, marking a shift in the political landscape. This defeat is a clear indicator of the diminishing support for Kamal Nath and the Congress party in a region once considered their stronghold.In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, Bunty Vivek Sahu secured 644,738 votes (49.41%) against Nakul Kamal Nath's 531,120 votes (40.7%), reflecting a decisive swing in favor of the BJP. This contrasted sharply with the 2019 results, where Nakul Nath narrowly retained the seat with a 3.01% lead over his BJP rival.The BJP's strategy to field Bunty Sahu, a long-time rival of Kamal Nath, paid off. Sahu, despite never having defeated Kamal Nath in previous contests, posed a consistent challenge and ultimately emerged victorious in 2024. The BJP's aggressive campaign in Chhindwara, which included the induction of thousands of Congress defectors, significantly bolstered their position.In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, Bunty Vivek Sahu secured 644,738 votes (49.41%) against Nakul Kamal Nath's 531,120 votes (40.7%), reflecting a decisive swing in favor of the BJP. This contrasted sharply with the 2019 results, where Nakul Nath narrowly retained the seat with a 3.01% lead over his BJP rival.Moreover, Kamal Nath, who was the chief ministerial candidate for the Madhya Pradesh Assembly elections, failed to secure a mandate from the people. Despite exit polls predicting a favorable outcome for him, Nath was defeated by a significant margin in a surprising turn of events. The BJP won an overwhelming victory, securing 163 seats, while the Congress was limited to just 66 seats.The recent electoral outcomes have highlighted a decline in support for the Congress party in Madhya Pradesh. The BJP's clean sweep, securing all 29 seats in the state, underscores the fading influence of Kamal Nath, a once formidable figure in Madhya Pradesh politics. Kamal Nath, once celebrated as a close confidant and third son of Indira Gandhi, dubbed “,” now faces the potential of political marginalization. His reputation, once bolstered by his unwavering loyalty and close association with the Gandhi family, is now overshadowed by recent setbacks and diminishing political clout.Adding to the challenges, rumors of Kamal Nath and his son Nakul Nath defecting to the BJP further eroded their credibility and allegiance to the Congress party during the crucial phase of the Lok Sabha elections. Despite these rumors, the lack of a clear denial only fueled speculation, contributing to a dent in their political standing. As the political landscape in Madhya Pradesh continues to shift, Kamal Nath’s future in active politics appears increasingly uncertain. He now faces the arduous task of reassessing his political strategy and addressing the internal challenges within the Congress party if he hopes to remain a relevant force in the state’s evolving political arena.","Kamal Nath, the former chief minister and a prominent Congress leader in Madhya Pradesh, is now facing challenges following two consecutive electoral defeats. Nakul Nath’s loss by a margin of 113,618 votes in a constituency historically dominated by the Nath family underscores the declining support for Kamal Nath and the Congress party in a region that was once their stronghold.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110820493,imgsize-857100,width-400,resizemode-4/110820493.jpg"

They said his leadership will boost the voice of the party members. Interestingly, according to sources, Kharge underlined that over 200 MPs will be standing behind him when he takes on the government.The perch will place Rahul at the head of the opposition bloc which has returned to the 18th Lok Sabha with a boosted tally after a decade, and the coming together of the anti-BJP parties under the INDIA bloc is likely to boost cohesion too.Kharge said Congress has posted a good performance, and increased its seats in SC/ST/OBC/minority dominated areas and in rural regions, but the party has to win in urban areas too. He pointedly noted that Congress has underperformed in the states where it had won assembly elections, in a reference to Karnataka, Himachal and Telangana.Thanking the INDIA allies for fighting well in different states, the CWC singled out Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra for special mention.At the same time, Kharge told party members that elections will be held in important states in coming months, a reference to Haryana and Maharashtra, and the party should defeat the rivals at any cost. ""People want a change, and we have to become their strength,"" he said.Congress members lamented the absence of a level playing field in the elections, or else the BJP would have got 100-150 seats fewer.

Challenges ahead for BJP-led NDA government with secular allies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/challenges-ahead-for-bjp-led-nda-government-with-secular-allies/articleshow/110826236.cms,"NEW DELHI: The new BJP-led NDA government , dependent on its allies , since on its own the saffron party is short of 32 votes from the simple majority mark of 272 in a House of 543 Lok Sabha seats, will find it difficult to push for BJP’s hard Hindutva line, since its main support comes from secular parties like TDP and JD(U).Among the NDA partners, substantial support to BJP which finished with 240 seats, comes from N Chandrababu Naidu ’s TDP representing Andhra Pradesh and Nitish Kumar ’s JDU representing Bihar.With that equation holding the Narendra Modi-led government, it will be difficult for BJP to push its hard Hindutva line, since Naidu and Kumar have both to cater to its minority voters in their respective states. Both seasoned, veteran leaders have been known for wooing minority voters and hence would have to take care to see minority citizens are not offended.Even before the swearing-in, TDP general secretary and Naidu’s son Nara Lokesh on Friday made a public statement saying his party is committed to the current 4% reservation for Muslims under the OBC list, as it is meant to expose the under-represented to opportunities.Naturally the previous Modi government’s policies of bringing CAA and NRC or approving UCC in some states and other such RSS-driven policies that hurts interests of minorities, are bound to hit a roadblock for now, if the government has to function.Even BJP’s hard Hindutva party line will have to be blurred, to create a comfort zone for the allies, who have become crucial for the survival of Modi’s third term at office.Kumar has been pushing for a national caste census, that RSS-BJP are uncomfortable with, hence it is to be seen whether it becomes a sticky point in the new coalition or the Modi government agrees to it.The minority population in Andhra Pradesh is 36.63 lakh (excluding Christians) as per the 2011 census of which Muslims 36.17 lakhs, Sikhs 0.10 lakhs, Buddhists 0.04 lakhs, Jains 0.27 lakhs and Parsis 0.04 lakhs. That Naidu will also head the state government in Andhra Pradesh, makes it more significant for him to be able to address the issues of the minorities.Bihar is home to almost 17% Muslims apart from other minorities and hence Kumar’s JD(U) has traditionally opposed anti-minorityism. In fact, for a long time before Kumar accepted working with Modi, even as there has been many flip-flops since, it was Modi’s anti-minority image during his chief ministership days in Gujarat, that created a political divide between the two leaders.While it is a matter of the past, it would not be easy for Kumar to accept hard-Hindutva agenda that was the mark of the last terms of Modi’s majority government.","N Chandrababu Naidu ’s TDP representing Andhra Pradesh and Nitish Kumar’s JDU representing Bihar.

Not interested in cabinet berth: Shrikant Shinde,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/not-interested-in-cabinet-berth-shrikant-shinde/articleshow/110825355.cms,"Shrikant Shinde

MUMBAI: Even as newly elected Shiv Sena MPs urged Kalyan MP and CM Eknath Shinde’s son Shrikant Shinde to take up a ministerial position at the centre, Shrikant said that the ultimate decision (about cabinet berths) will be taken on merit by CM Eknath Shinde . Shrikant said that CM Shinde always takes decisions on merit and will nominate MPs who have experience and have worked for the party. Shrikant said that he was not interested in becoming a minister and instead wanted to work for the party organisation at the grassroots level.

“I want to see how the party can grow. In the Lok Sabha polls, in just two years since the party split, we have got very good results in Mumbai also and outside Mumbai also. Out of the 19% Shiv Sena vote share, we have got 14.5% vote share. People have shown faith in us and those who left Balasaheb’s ideology got only 4.5% vote share. In the days to come, even this vote share will come to us in the assembly polls,” Shrikant said.

Shinde led Sena Shrikant as its group leader in the Lok Sabha and Maval MP Shrirang Barne as the party’s Chief Whip. CM Shinde is likely to nominate MP Barne and Prataprao Jadhav (Buldhana) for cabinet and Minister of State (MoS) berths at the centre. Senior Sena functionaries said that Barne was a front runner if the party gets only one berth in the union cabinet adding that CM Shinde was not hard bargaining with the BJP for any portfolios nor demanding any specific departments. There was speculation that CM Shinde could pick his son third time MP Dr Shinde for a ministerial berth but the functionary said that Shrikant would not be the choice. CM Shinde met his newly elected MPs at Varsha, his official residence where possible names for cabinet berths were discussed on Thursday. The MPs left the final decision of choosing a ministerial nominee for CM Shinde. The Sena is likely to get one cabinet berth and one Minister of State (MoS). In the outgoing PM Narendra Modi led govt, the Sena led by Shinde didn’t have any minister.

BJP: UP Elections Analysis: How BJP Lost Ground from Phase 1 and INDIA Bloc Emerged Strong,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/analysis-of-bjps-performance-in-different-phases-of-up-elections/articleshow/110779804.cms,"Top Picks For You Lok Sabha election results: In 72 UP seats, BJP got less votes in 2024 than in 2019

LUCKNOW: INDIA bloc emerged a gainer in UP right from the first phase. BSP was the loser in all phases while BJP managed to match its 2019 performance only in the second phase. The factors that made INDIA gain and BJP lose were common in every phase , unrest against candidates and local issues could have added to the resentment among voters against the ruling party in some seats.Phase 1BJP could win just one seat in the season opener -- Pilibhit. SP bagged maximum (4 of the 8 seats), Congress and RLD one each while Azad Samaz Party chief Chandrashekhar Azad won the Nagina seat. This phase had seats with high Muslim concentration and significant Dalit numbers. BSP was the biggest loser in this phase, as it lost all three seats from 2019. The reserved seat of Nagina, which has more than 20% Dalits, was won by Mayawati’s bete noire Azad while Saharanpur went to Congress’s Imran Masood, who was also with BSP till Mayawati expelled him last year. Bijnor, the third seat that BSP won in 2019, went to RLD, a BJP-ally. BJP, on the other hand, could retain only Pilibhit, having lost Kairana and Muzaffarnagar to SP. It was the consolidation of Muslim votes in favour of the INDIA bloc and Jatavs also shifting towards Congress that went in favour of the alliance. The articulate fielding of candidates by alliance in the seats and strong anti-incumbency against sitting BJP MPs in the seats also helped the opposition gain.Phase 2This phase was more about BSP’s loss. It could not retain Amroha, the fourth seat in west UP that it had won in 2019. BSP had expelled its sitting MP in Amroha, Danish Ali, last year for his proximity with Congress. He contested the seat as Congress candidate this time. Though he did not win, Ali drew more Muslim votes than BSP’s Mujahid Hussain. RLD, which did not win any seat in 2019, was a gainer this time as it won Baghpat. BJP swept the remaining seats. This phase was in favour of BJP because of the demography of the constituencies that went to the polls in the phase. Ghaziabad is a BJP stronghold and was won by Atul Garg despite resentment over VK Singh’s replacement as the candidate in the seat. The constituency has around 28 lakh voters, still the margin of win got reduced. Baghpat was a comfortable win for RLD due to consolidation of Jats.Phase 3SP got its tally increased from two to six in this phase, while BJP tally was reduced to half — from eight in 2019 to four in 2024. The four seats (Etah, Badaun, Firozabad and Aonla) BJP lost were won by SP. Firozabad and Badaun are the strongholds of Yadav clan. BJP lost Etah and Aonla because of strong anti-incumbency against Rajvir Singh aka Raju Bhaiyya (son of late Kalyan Singh) and Dharmendra Kashyap, respectively. In Bareilly, where BJP had replaced veteran Santosh Singh Gangwar with Chhatrapal Gangwar, the party won.Phase 4In this phase again, the INDIA bloc gained. Both SP and Congress did not win any seats in 2019 but in 2024, SP got four and Congress one. BJP came down to eight in 2024 from winning all 13 seats in 2019. It lost Sitapur to Congress and Kheri, Dhaurahra, Kannauj and Etawah (reserved seat) to SP. By fourth phase, INDIA bloc had already become active and SP chief Akhilesh Yadav’s candidature from Kannauj, which was announced quite late, had galvanized the party’s poll machinery in the state. Anti-incumbency against BJP MPs was far more clear now.Phase 5SP was the biggest gainer in the phase. It won Mohanlalganj (SC), Jalaun (SC), Hamirpur, Banda, Fatehpur, Kaushambi (SC) and Faizabad while it won none in 2019. Congress, too, increased its tally from one in 2019 to three in 2024. BJP won only Lucknow, Jhansi, Gonda and Kaiserganj. In 2019, BJP had lost only Rae Bareli and won all. It came down from 13 in 2019 to four in 2024. SP gained seven seats from zero in 2019. This phase had maximum reserved seats going to polls. In Kaushambi, Vinod Sonkar lost after a strong Rajput leader from Kunda, Raghuraj Pratap Singh aka Raja Bhaiya, decided to stay neutral in the elections. Among the major losses was also Faizabad where Lallu Singh lost to SP veteran Awadhesh Prasad. Among other major losses in this phase were Amethi, where Smriti Irani lost to Gandhi family loyalist KL Sharma.Phase 6SP got a maximum of 10 seats in phase 6. It won a single seat in 2019. BSP lost all four while Congress gained one, from zero in 2019. BJP suffered loss of six seats, coming down to three from nine. The four seats BSP won in 2019, Ambedkarnagar, Shravasti, Lalganj (SC) and Jaunpur went to SP. Anti-incumbency against BJP MPs and Akhilesh Yadav’s smart choice of candidates with focus on non-Yadav OBCs affected the results in the phase. Eight-time MP Maneka Gandhi from Sultanpur, Sangam Lal Gupta from Pratapgarh, Ritesh Pandey from Ambedkarnagar, Saket Misra (son of Ram temple construction committee chairman Nripendra Misra) from Shravasti, Harish Dwivedi from Basti, Praveen Nishad from Sant Kabir Nagar, Neelam Sonkar from Lalganj, Kripa Shanker Singh from Jaunpur, Dinesh Lal Yadav Nirahua from Azamgarh and BP Saroj from Machhlishahr lost. BJP also lost Allahabad to Congress candidate Ujjwal Raman Singh.Phase 7SP was the gainer again, from zero seats in 2019 to six in 2024, in this phase. BJP lost three from 2019, and won only six. BSP lost two it won in 2019, Ghosi and Ghazipur. AD(S) was confined to only Mirzapur after losing Robertsganj (SC) to SP. PM Modi’s margin came down from 3.8 lakh in 2019 to 1.6 lakh in 2024. The phase also saw upper caste and backward votes split, because of which SP won Ghosi, as upper caste voters preferred SP’s Rajeev Rai over BJP-ally SBSP’s Arvind Rajbhar. In Chandauli, Union minister Mahendra Nath Pandey faced defeat. BSP lost Ghazipur, where SP Afzal Ansari was contesting after the death of his brother and mafia-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari, though it won Gorakhpur, Maharajganj, Bansgaon, Deoria and Kushinagar, the five seats considered part of CM Yogi Adityanath's home turf.","BJP could win just one seat in the season opener -- Pilibhit. SP bagged maximum (4 of the 8 seats), Congress and RLD one each while Azad Samaz Party chief Chandrashekhar Azad won the Nagina seat.

Actor-politician Suresh Gopi’s maverick attitude cause of BJP Kerala unit’s worry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/actor-politician-suresh-gopis-maverick-attitude-cause-of-bjp-kerala-units-worry/articleshow/110810742.cms,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Actor-politician Suresh Gopi , who finally broke BJP's jinx in LS polls from Thrissur , is likely to become a Union minister in the Narendra Modi govt . But the worry before the party state leadership, amid the jubilation, is the maverick ways of the MP during public interactions and his refusal to publicly own up his party's ideology.Though he never crossed swords with the state leadership, Gopi stayed away from BJP's organizational affairs ever since he joined the party in 2016. He did not hesitate to publicly declare that his first allegiance was to PM Modi and Amit Shah and that he will obey them.But state leaders feel that their efforts to increase the voter base and widen the party's acceptance in Thrissur and other constituencies must be acknowledged duly.Unlike disgruntled leaders, such as Sobha Surendran, Gopi's cold approach to state unit stems mainly from his failure to fathom the dynamics of party politics and the importance of the organisation, they said.Of late, what irked the leaders was Gopi's response to the reception planned for him along with Rajeev Chandrasekhar and V Muraleedharan at BJP state headquarters after the result declaration. Gopi said that people have started adopting an 'apolitical' stand and his victory in Thrissur was a testimony to the same.""We really don't know whether he used the word 'apolitical' after fully understanding its meaning. Hope he did not. I wonder how a person, who is a member of a political party and now a people's representative, could say so and that too at a function at the party's state headquarters. It would be a tough task for state leaders to rein in the new Union minister,"" said a senior BJP leader.If Gopi continues his puerile public statements and refuses to publicly endorse the politics of BJP, it could pose serious problems to the state unit. Already, a section of leaders with RSS background are waiting for the emergence of another power centre in the state unit to settle the score with Surendran and Muraleedharan.Several senior leaders dismissed the possibility of Gopi emerging as a parallel power centre in the party as he had no axe to grind with any leader. They said he isn't ready to meddle in internal politics. But many pointed out the ominous similarities in the victory of Gopi and former BJP leader O Rajagopal who won Nemom assembly seat in 2016. Rajagopal also tried to project his win as a personal triumph but failed to take care of the constituency. BJP also failed to retain the seat in 2021 assembly election.",Actor-politician Suresh Gopi finally broke BJP's jinx in LS polls from Thrissur.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to take oath his third successive term on June 8.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) secured victory in the recent Lok Sabha elections, clinching 240 seats. However, this figure falls significantly short of the impressive 303 seats the party had won in the 2019 elections, meaning it has been unable to convert its vote share into seats this time.Several factors contributed to the loss of over 60 seats. The Samajwadi Party, led by Akhilesh Yadav, made substantial gains in Uttar Pradesh, a crucial state that had played a pivotal role in the Prime Minister's two previous victories. The Samajwadi Party emerged as the star performer of the Congress-led alliance, delivering its best-ever Lok Sabha performance. The BJP's seat count in the state fell from 64 in 2019 to 33, while the NDA's tally dropped to 34.In Maharashtra, the effective collaboration among Congress, Uddhav Thackeray, and Sharad Pawar resulted in a setback for the ruling party's performance. In West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee successfully defended her stronghold.The following is a state-wise breakdown of the election results:","Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to take oath on June 8.

VISAKHAPATNAM/VIJAYAWADA: The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) emerged victorious in the Lok Sabha election in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, securing 31 out of the 42 seats, a significant improvement from their tally of just four seats in the 2019 polls. This success helped the BJP compensate for some of its losses in other parts of the country. N Chandrababu Naidu , the former chief minister of the erstwhile undivided state of Andhra Pradesh, spearheaded the NDA's impressive performance. His party, the Telugu Desam Party ( TDP ), won a remarkable 16 out of the 25 seats in Andhra Pradesh. The BJP, which contested six seats in the state, managed to secure three seats, while actor-politician Pawan Kalyan's Janasena Party won two seats.The ruling YSRCP faced a setback, managing to win only four seats in the state.The Congress-led INDIA alliance suffered a complete defeat, failing to secure a single seat in Andhra Pradesh, mirroring their performance in the 2019 polls.In the state of Andhra Pradesh, Daggubati Purandheshwari , the BJP state party president, emerged victorious in Rajahmundry, despite facing accusations of being an ""outsider"" from her political opponents. Meanwhile, in Nellore, Vemireddy Prabhakar Reddy , the TDP candidate, secured a win against V Vijaysai Reddy of the ruling YSRCP. Vemireddy had recently switched allegiance from the YSRCP to the TDP, citing chief ministerYS Jagan Mohan Reddy 's alleged disregard for his self-respect as the reason for his defection.The Kadapa Lok Sabha constituency, known as a bastion of the ruling family, saw an intense rivalry between siblings during the elections. YS Sharmila, the sister of chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, contested from the region on a Congress ticket, going up against her cousin and YSRCP candidate, YS Avinash Reddy. Sharmila was unsuccessful in her bid, with Avinash Reddy securing the seat for the YSRCP.In 1996, after the BJP was invited to form the government, Chandrababu Naidu became the convenor of the United Front, which governed the Centre from 1996-98 with the outside support of the Congress, following Vajpayee's resignation after a 13-day stint. In mid-April 1997, when the Congress withdrew its support from the UF government led by then Prime Minister H D Deve Gowda, Naidu played a crucial role in the selection of the next Prime Minister.Now, 27 years later, as the election results poured in on Tuesday, it became evident that Naidu, at the age of 74, has returned to his role as a kingmaker. The TDP has emerged as the second-largest party in the NDA, securing 16 Lok Sabha seats in Andhra Pradesh. This outcome means that while the BJP requires Naidu's support at the Centre, he does not need them in the state, solidifying his position as a kingmaker.In the lead-up to the assembly elections, Naidu had a clear understanding of his political vote bank. The TDP was aware of the popularity of the freebies offered by former chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy, particularly among women voters. Consequently, the party made a concerted effort to win over this constituency. Naidu's son, Nara Lokesh, specifically reached out to women voters during his Yuva Gallam Yatra. The TDP enjoys the support of the politically influential Kamma community, but to secure victory, Naidu needed to win over the Kaapu community, which also supports Jagan Reddy. By forming an alliance with Pawan Kalyan's Jana Sena Party, Naidu gained the crucial support of the Kaapus, and this arithmetic worked in his favor in both the parliamentary and assembly elections.","The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) secured 31 out of the 42 seats. N Chandrababu Naidu spearheaded the NDA's impressive performance. His party, the Telugu Desam Party ( TDP ), won a remarkable 16 out of 25 seats in Andhra Pradesh. The BJP, which contested six seats in the state, managed to secure three seats.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110727866,imgsize-47996,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/110727866.jpg"

It made a huge difference in winning the polls. The home minister addressed a very powerful meeting there.

""Chandrababu ji, your prophecy has come true. Modi ji, you truly inspire the nation. As long as you are PM, our country will never bow down to anyone,"" he said. Modi's response to the actor-turned-politician, ""yeh pawan nahi hai, aandhi hai,"" has gone viral on the internet.Speaking earlier, Naidu called for collective effort towards a ""zero poverty nation"", and described the moment as a ""crucial juncture in our nation's history"".","N Chandrababu Naidu praised Narendra Modi's leadership for transforming India into a ""global powerhouse"" He acknowledged the ""huge difference"" the latter made to TDP's sweep of Andhra Pradesh.

Undeterred by the opposition, Khaira sticks to his proposal, arguing an HP-like law will protect Punjab 's demographic composition and prevent non-Punjabis from “encroaching upon” the state govt jobs.To explain why this law was necessary, he cited the migration of 75 lakh of Punjab’s 3 crore population over the past few decades along with similar active laws in Gujarat and Uttarakhand that had forced Punjabi farmers out of those states.

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan , currently jailed, invoked the case of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal receiving bail ahead of Lok Sabha elections as he protested his mistreatment in jail before the Supreme Court of Pakistan.Appearing on Thursday before a five-member bench led by Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa, Khan decried the ""victimisation"" he has faced since being ousted from power in April 2022.The bench, which included Justices Aminuddin Khan, Jamal Khan Mandokhel, Athar Minallah, and Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, heard Khan's grievances regarding amendments to the National Accountability Ordinance (NAO). Justice Minallah expressed sympathy, acknowledging the misfortune of Khan being in jail despite leading a major political party with millions of supporters, as per reports.Khan, 71, argued that his conviction within five days was a deliberate attempt to sideline him from the general elections held on February 8. He contrasted his situation with that of Kejriwal, who was granted bail by India's Supreme Court, enabling him to campaign. Khan contended that Pakistan is operating under an undeclared ""martial law,"" further oppressing his political activities.Expressing disappointment over the Supreme Court's rejection of a request from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's government for live streaming the case, Khan questioned the judgment's implication that he was engaging in political point-scoring. Chief Justice Isa responded that a judge need not explain their verdicts, advising Khan to file a review petition instead.Khan urged the Supreme Court to appoint a chairman for the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), criticizing the current appointment process as being influenced by a ""third umpire"" when consensus between the Opposition and government fails. Justice Minallah countered, stating there was no justification to invalidate the NAB amendments.The PTI founder called for reforms in NAB, citing ongoing inquiries against him. Justice Minallah's reminder about the Chief Election Commissioner appointment led Khan to argue that restoring the amendment would benefit his NAB cases but potentially bankrupt the country.Chief Justice Isa prohibited Khan from referencing the Islamabad High Court (IHC) verdict in the cipher cases, as appeals might be pending in the Supreme Court. Justice Rizvi questioned Khan's failure to oppose the NAB amendments in Parliament, to which Khan replied that his government was overthrown through a conspiracy, making it futile to engage with the current ""conspiratorial government.""Khan also sought a comparison of his jail conditions with those afforded to former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. In response, Justice Mandokhel humorously noted that Sharif is not currently in jail, asking if Khan wished for his incarceration. Chief Justice Isa concluded the session by mentioning the possibility of a surprise visit by a judicial officer to inspect Khan's jail conditions.",Imran Khan appeared before the Supreme Court of Pakistan on Thursday. The former Pakistan Prime Minister is currently jailed for contempt of court. Khan argued that his conviction within five days was a deliberate attempt to sideline him from the general elections held on February 8. The bench heard Khan's grievances regarding amendments to the National Accountability Ordinance.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110799336,imgsize-1004244,width-400,resizemode-4/110799336.jpg"

Labour pledges fresh inquiry into Thatcher's role in 1984 Operation Blue Star,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/labour-pledges-fresh-inquiry-into-thatchers-role-in-1984-operation-blue-star/articleshow/110776077.cms,"LONDON: The Labour party , which is forecast to win the July 4 UK general election, has pledged to hold an inquiry to investigate the role Britain played in storming the Golden Temple in June 1984 to remove Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and other Sikh militants, which triggered the assassination of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and the anti-Sikh riots.

Deputy Labour leader Angela Raynor said, “As we mark the 40th anniversary of the raid on the Golden Temple, Labour stands with the Sikh community in calling for an inquiry into the historic role Britain played. A Labour govt will work to determine the best way to find out the truth.”

Labour candidate for Coventry South Zarah Sultana said: “The role Thatcher’s govt played in this has been shrouded in secrecy. I stand with the Sikh community in calling for an inquiry to reveal the truth.” Labour candidate for Slough Tan Dhesi wrote on X: “40 years since Indira Gandhi ordered attack on Golden Temple complex…Still no justice for victims, nor UK inquiry (but Labour have promised) into Thatcher govt involvement!”

There has been no independent public inquiry into Margaret Thatcher’s involvement in Operation Blue Star , despite the release of classified documents in Jan 2014 implicating the UK govt.

Those files revealed that Britain had sent an SAS officer to India in Feb, ahead of Operation Blue Star, to draw up a plan to “remove Sikh extremists from the Golden temple”, having been asked to do so by Indira Gandhi.

The Heywood Review, commissioned by former PM David Cameron and published in Feb 2014, found no record of any UK assistance to the June 1984 operation other than the “limited military advice provided in mid-February”. The review, based on over 23,000 documents, said: “The recommendation and decision to agree this request were based on advice from the British high commission that it would be good for the bilateral relationship, whereas refusal would not be understood by Mrs Gandhi. There were significant differences between the actual June operation, and the advice from the UK military officer in Feb. The actual operation implemented by the Indian Army differed significantly from the approach suggested by the UK military officer.”

Many British Sikhs believe the Heywood Review is a whitewash and are calling for an independent judge-led public inquiry.
