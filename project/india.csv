‘Jealousy?’ BJP asks why Cong didn’t pick Tharoor

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor ’s acceptance of the government nomination to lead a global outreach team , coming close on the heels of his comments about the conflict with Pakistan, including a defence of PM Modi government on the Pahalgam attack , and complaints at the Congress Working Committee meeting that he was straying from the party line, tantamount to daring the party, if not defying it.Congress has a lot to mull while deciding about Tharoor, crucial being the upcoming elections in Kerala where it is facing a tough challenge from the ruling Left front as well as from BJP’s bid to cut into Congress’s vote bank.In a democratic system, when individual MPs are sent on an official delegation, MPs should seek the concurrence of the party,” Jairam Ramesh said, calling it “dishonest” and “downright mischievous” for the government to request nominees after possibly deciding them on its own.However, its protest lost the sting with Tharoor gladly accepting the nomination. Formerly a senior functionary with the UN, Tharoor has also served as junior external affairs minister and was recommended by Congress last year to head the standing committee on foreign affairs. “It is an honour,” he said, adding that the issue involved national interest and should not be seen through the prism of partisan politics.Significantly,Congress’s partners in INDIA alliance — DMK ’s Kanimozhi and NCP ’s Supriya Sule — did not turn down invitations to be part of the delegations. Other delegations will be led by Ravi Shankar Prasad (BJP), Sanjay Jha (JDU), Shrikant Shinde (Shiv Sena) and Baijayant Panda (BJP).Government had on Friday rejected Congress’s claim that it had the sole prerogative of deciding who from the party should be part of the delegations. “This has not to do with party politics,” minister for parliamentary affairs Kiren Rijiju is learnt to have told the Congress leadership, sources said.Congress’s stand drew an angry response from BJP. “ Congress choices to represent India at diplomatic meetings are not just intriguing — they are deeply questionable. Take, for instance, the inclusion of Syed Naseer Hussain. Let’s not forget — it was his supporter who raised ‘Pakistan Zindabad’ slogans inside the Vidhana Soudha while celebrating his Rajya Sabha victory. Bengaluru police arrested three individuals in connection with the incident...,” Amit Malviya, head of party’s IT cell, said on X. He added “the less said about Gaurav Gogoi, the better”, pointing out that the deputy leader of Congress in LS had spent 15 days in Pakistan, with his departure and arrival duly logged at the Attari crossing.Malviya also said, “No one can deny Shashi Tharoor’s eloquence, his long experience as a UN official, and his deep insights on matters of foreign policy. So why has the Congress Party — and Rahul Gandhi in particular — chosen not to nominate him. Is it insecurity? Jealousy? Or simply intolerance of anyone who outshines the ‘high command’?”",Congress has a lot to mull while deciding about Tharoor. The party is facing a tough challenge from the ruling Left front as well as from BJP.

VADODARA: Police in Gujarat Saturday arrested the elder son of minister of state for panchayats Bachu Khabad in connection with an alleged Rs 71 crore scam tied to MGNREGS in Dahod district. Balwant Khabad was taken into custody near Bathwada toll plaza after weeks of evading arrest.Police alleged that he was linked to Shri Raj Construction Co, which received payments for supplying materials for Nrega projects despite not qualifying through bidding. His younger brother Kiran Khabad, connected to Shri Raj Traders, remains at large. Both firms received funds without securing contracts, police added.The scam, unearthed in April by Dahod’s district rural development authority (DRDA), involved 32 firms supplying materials in Devgadh Baria and Dhanpur talukas. None had emerged as lowest bidders, a requirement under procurement rules. DRDA’s inquiry revealed several projects were either never initiated or inflated, yet payments were cleared.Khabad, an OBC heavyweight of BJP and a four-term MLA, has not responded publicly to his son’s arrest. Balwant and Kiran had filed anticipatory bail applications in Dahod court but later withdrew them.Balwant and co-accused Darshit Patel, a taluka development officer currently posted in Kheda, were produced in Dahod court and remanded in police custody for five days. Patel was earlier posted in Devgadh Baria, one of the talukas named in the investigation.Seven people have been arrested so far in the scam, which came to light following multiple representations to DRDA, including Congress legislators. Leader of opposition Amit Chavda, of Congress, demanded formation of an SIT, alleging: “This scam could be much larger. Only an honest investigation can uncover full details.”","Balwant Khabad was taken into custody near Bathwada toll plaza after weeks of evading arrest.
