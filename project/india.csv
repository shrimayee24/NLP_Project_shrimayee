Jaya Amitabh Bachchan | Short Duration Discussion on the recent tragic incident of death of students

NEW DELHI: Bollywood veteran and Samajwadi Party MP Jaya Bachchan on Monday got annoyed at the Rajya Sabha deputy chairman as he called her to speak by saying 'Jaya Amitabh Bachchan.In no time after deputy chairman's address, she raised a strong objection to ""being identified with her husband's name"".""Sir, sirf Jaya Bachchan bolte to kaafi hojata (Saying only Jaya Bachchan would have sufficed),"" the Samajwadi leader said.Laughing at the remark, Harivansh Narayan Singh , who was in chair at that time said, ""Your full name was written here, I just repeated the same.""""Ye jo hain kuch naya tarika hain ki mahilaayen apni pati ke naam se jaani jaye. Unka koi astitva nahi. Unki koi upalabdh hi nahi hain, apne mein aur astitva nahi hain. (This is a new method that the women will be known by the names of their husbands, they do not have any identity of their own),"" Bachchan said.""They (Women) do not have any achievement of their own, they do not haqve any identity of your own,"" she said.Singh, however, tried to calm the situation by saying, ""You have many achievements.""Bachchan, after this, continued her speech on the recent deaths of three students at a Delhi coaching centre. She asked political parties to rise above petty politics over such matters.After Nirbhaya incident, she said, it's the first time she was witnessing such a heated discussion over an issue.Meanwhile, five people were sent to 14-day judicial custody on Monday in the case.Senior police officials said the coaching centre's basement got flooded mainly because the civic authority failed to clear the roadside drain before the onset of Monsoon and there was no provision for draining out water at the basement where a library was running illegally.The IAS aspirants who died in the incident have been identified as Shreya Yadav (25) of Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh, Tanya Soni (25) from Telangana and Nevin Delvin (24) from Ernakulam in Kerala.","Bollywood veteran and Samajwadi Party MP Jaya Bachchan got annoyed at the Rajya Sabha deputy chairman as he called her to speak.

"On Rahul Gandhi's 'halwa ceremony' photo charge, BJP says 'Gandhi legacy'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/on-rahul-gandhis-halwa-ceremony-photo-charge-bjp-says-gandhi-legacy/articleshow/112112927.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) on Monday countered the leader of the opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi 's charge over ""no SC, ST, and OBC"" in ' halwa ceremony ' of this year with "" Gandhi legacy "".Minutes after Rahul Gandhi's fierce attack on the Modi government 3.0 over the Union budget , BJP IT head cell head Amit Malviya said, ""If there are no OBC officers at the top echelons of the Govt, it is Third Time Fail Rahul Gandhi’s father Rajiv Gandhi and grandmother Indira Gandhi’s legacy.""""The Congress has been anti SC/ST and OBCs since Independence.Jawaharlal Nehru had written to the Chief Ministers, explicitly opposing reservations for SCs and STs ... The Congress did not even implement Mandal Commission recommendations, made in 1983. Finally, it was a BJP supported Govt that implemented it in 1990. Rajiv Gandhi vehemently opposed OBC quota in 1990,"" Malviya said in a post on X.""Under Sonia Gandhi (between 2004-10), the Congress tried to defraud the OBCs in Andhra Pradesh by giving away a chunk of their quota to Muslims. They even tried to include Muslims under the central OBC quota in 2011, which would have reduced the OBC share in central institutions and jobs. More recently, in Karnataka, the Congress has included the entire Muslim community in the OBC list. So, Balak Buddhi Rahul Gandhi should know, that Congress’s history is replete with instances of obstructing reservation for SC/ST and OBCs. It is an anti-Hindu party,"" he added.Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju also questioned Rahul Gandhi's speech and criticised him for ""attacking the Speaker and speaking beyond the rules"".""In the Lok Sabha, the way LoP Rahul Gandhi attacked the Speaker and spoke beyond the rules, I condemn it. Being the Leader of the Opposition is a responsibility, but he is being irresponsible. The House works according to the rules and Speaker is the custodian of the House but Rahul Gandhi kept attacking the Speaker,"" Rijiju said.""The representatives of 140 crore people of the country sit in the Parliament. Rahul Gandhi has always been to speak according to the rules but he has always been breaking the rules. Since Rahul Gandhi has now become the LoP, he will have to work according to the rules of the Parliament. No one is above the rules or the Constitution,"" he added.Union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw targeted Gandhi's ""language"" and said, ""... It is sad that Rahul Gandhi's behaviour as the leader of the opposition and the language he uses in Parliament, questioning the constitutional post of the Lok Sabha Speaker, is an action to undermine democracy and the Constitution.""Recalling 2013 incident, Vaishnaw said, ""There is a history behind this when Rahul Gandhi publicly tore the ordinance brought by his government, so I do not see any intention of him to follow the limits of the Constitution.""BJP's national general secretary BL Santhosh, shared images on X (formerly Twitter) featuring the board members of the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation. The list included prominent Congress leaders such as Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, former prime minister Manmohan Singh, and P Chidambaram. Santhosh posed a question to the public, asking them to identify which of these board members belong to the OBC, SC, and ST categories.""Rajiv Gandhi Foundation Board for your perusal. Identify OBCs, SCs and STs for the use of the Congress and its troll army,"" Santhosh wrote In his post on X. Along with this message, he shared a screenshot taken from the foundation's website, clearly displaying the names and photographs of its board members.BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla also lashed out Rahul saying, ""If hypocrisy had a face! Today, Rahul Gandhi says help MSME, not big business.

A chakravyuha has violence and fear. Abhimanyu was trapped and killed in the chakravyuha,"" he said.Gandhi's reference was to the Mahabharat legend according to which Abhimanyu was killed in a chakravyuha -- a multi-tiered maze and formation -- in which he was trapped.He said the chakravyuha is also called a 'Padmavyūha' which is a multi-tiered formation that looks like a lotus (the BJP symbol).""You build a chakravyuha, and we break the chakravyuha,"" Gandhi said, asserting that the opposition would break this cycle by carrying out a caste census.","BJP IT head cell head Amit Malviya said, ""If there are no OBC officers at the top echelons of the Govt, it is Third Time Fail Rahul Gandhi's father Rajiv Gandhi and grandmother Indira Gandhi’s legacy"" The Congress has been anti SC/ST and OBCs since Independence, he added.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112112943,imgsize-1030043,width-400,resizemode-4/112112943.jpg"
Supreme Court notice to Ajit faction in NCP feud over MLA disqualification,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-notice-to-ajit-faction-in-ncp-feud-over-mla-disqualification/articleshow/112118257.cms,"NEW DELHI: The feud between the rival factions of Nationalist Congress Party has returned to the Supreme Court, which on Monday issued notice to the Ajit Pawar group, recognised by Election Commission has as the real NCP, on a petition challenging Maharashtra Speaker 's decision not to disqualify its MLAs for joining the Sena (Shinde) and BJP in the ruling coalition.After hearing senior advocate A M Singhvi, a bench of CJI D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra said the petition by Jayant Patil, belonging to Sharad Pawar faction of NCP, could be tagged along with Sena (UBT)'s petition challenging Speaker's order rejecting disqualification pleas against Sena (Shinde) faction MLAs.This was protested by senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi and N K Kaul, who said the two issues are separate and should not be tagged. To assuage the feeling, the bench said though the issues raised in both petitions - by Sena (UBT) and NCP (Sharad Pawar) - are similar, it would list them one after the other.Singhvi said despite the Supreme Court ruling that the Speaker cannot decide disqualification pleas against rebel MLAs based on their numbers, or majority in the legislative assembly, the Speaker has done just that and subverted the Supreme Court dicta. As the assembly elections are round the corner, the Speaker deliberately delayed his decision to frustrate the operation of the anti-defection law, Singhvi alleged.Maharashtra assembly speaker Rahul Narwekar had rejected cross petitions filed by both factions of NCP for disqualification of MLAs belonging to the opposite camps. ""The NCP constitution and leadership structure of the party doesn't provide any clue to decide which is the real faction, hence, I have gone by the third yardstick which is legislative majority to decide the issue,"" he had ruled, adding, ""the Sharad Pawar faction hasn't challenged the claim of legislative majority enjoyed by the Ajit Pawar faction"".Sharad Pawar group said that NCP was founded, created, and taken to the present height politically through the efforts of the founder and that it was preposterous on Speaker's part to assume that Ajit Pawar faction is the real NCP. It alleged that the Speaker has rendered provisions of the Tenth Supreme Court hedule (anti-defection law) otiose by his ruling and put premium on defection.","The feud between the rival factions of Nationalist Congress Party has returned to the Supreme Court.

"Farmers, youth trapped in ‘chakravyuh’, but will break free: Rahul in Lok Sabha",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/farmers-youth-trapped-in-chakravyuh-but-will-break-free-rahul-in-lok-sabha/articleshow/112117817.cms,"Budget has done nothing on paper leaks & unemployment, says Rahul



NEW DELHI: Leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi on Monday said the middle class that “beat thalis and lit mobile phone torches with gusto during Covid-19 on one order of PM Modi” are set to desert BJP and support opposition because the recent Budget has “stabbed them in the back and chest” by removing indexation and raising capital gains taxes.Speaking in Lok Sabha, Rahul said under Modi’s regime, the entire country — farmers , youth, soldiers, backward classes and MSMEs — are trapped in a vicious “chakravyuh”.“But BJP should not mistake Indians for Abhimanyu. They are Arjun and will break free,” he said. Rahul said he had expected that the finance minister would heed farmers’ demand for legal guarantee on MSP, and the caste census clamour.Rahul said INDIA bloc would fulfil these demands. It was an iteration of Congress ' Lok Sabha election pledge with an eye on coming state polls in which farmers and backward classes constitute key vote banks. Rahul claimed the Budget has done nothing on unemployment and paper leaks, and has pushed education allocation to its lowest in 20 years, while providing no money for pension for Agniveers.The speech was accompanied by interventions by top ministers. Defence minister Rajnath Singh charged Rahul with misleading LS on the sensitive issue of Agniveers, and said he was ready to give a statement whenever asked. Interestingly, at one point, Rahul flashed the photograph of finance ministry's Budget ritual of ""halwa ceremony"" to point out that not one of the officers in the photo belonged to the 73% population - SC/ST/OBC - at which Sitharaman was seen laughing. Rahul took exception, saying ""caste census was not a laughing matter, and the exercise would change the country"".Rahul's address was replete with religious symbolism and analogies. After employing ""hum do, hamare do"", ""suit boot ki sarkar"", ""daro mat"", ""abhay mudra"" as buzzwords over the years, Rahul on Monday used the theme of ""chakravyuh"" in which ""Abhimanyu was killed by six persons"", adding that Kurukshetra's mythological episode was being re-enacted in the 21st century by the ""trap"" controlled by PM, home minister, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, Gautam Adani, Mukesh Ambani and NSA Ajit Doval.After painting a grim picture of the ""trap"" run by top ""establishment"" principals and underpinned by ""financial power, deep state and political executive"", Rahul sought to hang it around BJP by stating that a synonym of ""chakravyuh"" is ""padmavyuh"" (lotus formation) - BJP's symbol that he said Modi has pinned to his chest.Amid guffaws and furore alike, he went about describing what he called was govt's ""trap"" on different sections - unemployment and paper leak on youth, debt on farmers, tax on middle class, tax terrorism on MSMEs, Agnipath on soldiers and lack of representation on backward classes. He said the counter to ""chakravyuh"" (restriction) is ""shiv ki barat"" (which welcomes all). ""It is a fight between 'chakravyuh' and 'shiv ki barat'. The former cannot beat the latter. You (BJP) call yourself Hindus, but you don't understand it. We will break the 'chakravyuh',"" Rahul said, adding it would be done through MGNREGA, freedom, Constitution, caste census, MSP law and other policies.""My expectation was that this Budget would weaken the power of this Chakravyuh, but the aim of this Budget is to strengthen the framework of big business, monopoly business, of a political monopoly that destroys the democratic structure and of the deep state, or the agencies,"" he said.","Rahul Gandhi: Budget has done nothing on paper leaks & unemployment.

MUMBAI/AKOLA/SAMBHAJINAGAR: Sharad Pawar must apologise to Union home minister Amit Shah for his statement that Shah had been externed by SC for misusing the law, Union minister and BJP MP from Mumbai North Piyush Goyal said on Saturday. While BJP state president Chandrashekhar Bawankule said the courts had given Shah a clean chit, BJP minister Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil said Pawar should refrain from making personal attacks.Pawar had made the “externment” taunt after Shah called the NCP (SP) chief the “kingpin of corruption.”Addressing a press conference at the BJP state headquarters, Goyal said it was the UPA govt, of which Pawar was an important part, which had filed a false and baseless case against Shah, which was ripped apart by Supreme Court.Goyal said, ""Sensing the increasing popularity of then Gujarat CM Narendra Modi and aware it was losing the next elections, the UPA govt tried to make out a false case against Shah so it could also ensnare Modi. Pawar was a cabinet minister and was part of this conspiracy.”Bawankule said, “The court has already given Shah a clean chit and therefore, Sharad Pawar’s statement is uncalled for. The allegations against Shah were made during the Congress era.”He alleged the Congress and Pawar’s political ideology revolves around power and money. “Amit Bhai does not speak unless he has concrete information. Criticising him is like showing a lamp to the sun,” Bawankule said.Responding to this, Pawar said, “The lamp (diya) they are alluding to, we have witnessed him in Maharashtra’s prisons.”Vikhe Patil said Pawar’s criticism was out of frustration. He further stated, “There are also allegations against Sharad Pawar on issues related to bomb blast accused which people know about. But that doesn’t mean we should keep on discussing the issues politically.”Vikhe Patil added that the SC had given a clean chit to Amit Shah on the issue. “Amit Bhai is our leader… He was Union home minister in the past and is the minister in the current govt of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In his tenure, he has done away with Article 370. Wonder why it could not happen earlier.” Pawar had said on Friday, “We have a home minister who was banished by the Supreme Court. It is astonishing that the individual responsible for the country’s security and who is helming the home ministry was once expelled from Gujarat by the Supreme Court.”",Sharad Pawar faced backlash from BJP leaders after making accusations against Amit Shah.
