"Reservation is Modi’s guarantee, Rahul telling lies: Amit Shah",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/reservation-is-modis-guarantee-rahul-telling-lies-amit-shah/articleshow/109672518.cms,"GANDHINAGAR/AGRA/ETAWAH: Union home minister Amit Shah , at a rally in Ahmedabad on Sunday – and later in rallies in western Uttar Pradesh -- said PM Narendra Modi has guaranteed people that as long as the BJP is in power, nobody would be allowed to tamper with reservation for members of the SC , ST and OBC communities.Shah was responding to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s post on X which said that the BJP intends to “snatch away reservation of Dalits, backward castes and tribals and end their participation in running the affairs of the country”.“By making baseless comments, Rahul Gandhi has been attempting to mislead people of the country. The BJP has formed the Union govt for 10 years with full majority. If the BJP had any such intentions, reservation would have been abolished,” Shah said, adding, “Modi has given a guarantee to the people that as long as the BJP is in power, nobody can tamper with reservation.”Shah said it is the Congress party that has attacked reservation for SCs, STs and OBCs. “When the Congress came to power in Karnataka, it implemented 4% reservation for minorities. The reservation of OBCs was reduced. Then in Andhra Pradesh, Congress implemented 5% reservation for minorities. The share of SCs, STs, and OBCs got reduced,” Shah said.In Jamia Millia and Aligarh University, those from SC, ST and OBC communities are bereft of reservation even today, he said.“The Congress opposed backward castes, caused problems for Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar and did not do justice to tribals,” he said, adding that it was the Narendra Modi govt which did justice to the tribal community when Droupadi Murmu was named the President of India.In UP, Shah hit out at Samajwadi Party (SP) over its stand on Ram temple and giving the ‘Pran Prathistha’ ceremony a miss. “This election is between those who shot at Ram devotees and those who built Ram Mandir,” he said at an election rally in Mainpuri. BJP has fielded Jaiveer Singh against SP chief’s wife, Dimple Yadav, from the seat.“Should the Ram temple have been built in Ayodhya or not? After Congress, SP and BSP governed UP for years. They kept this issue aside but Modi ji won the case and did bhoomi pujan in five years. Akhilesh ji and Dimple ji were invited for Pran Pratishtha. But they did not attend. Who were they afraid of? Were they were afraid of losing their vote bank?” Shah asked.Attacking SP for practising “nepotism”, he said, “SP claims to represent Yadavs. This time Akhilesh is contesting from Kannauj, Dimple Yadav from Mainpuri, Akshay Yadav from Firozabad, Aditya Yadav from Budaun and Dharmendra Yadav from Azamgarh. I want to ask Akhilesh, why don’t you find other ‘Yadavs’; why only those from your family? The time has come to end the nepotism and let lotus bloom in Mainpuri.”","Shah was responding to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s post on X which said that the BJP intends to “snatch away reservation of Dalits, backward castes and tribals” “By making baseless comments, Rahul Gandhi has been attempting to mislead people of the country.

'Not joining any political party': Arvinder Singh Lovely after resigning as Delhi Congress chief,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/have-only-resigned-as-delhi-congress-chief-not-joining-any-political-party-arvinder-singh-lovely/articleshow/109666460.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Congress party 's Delhi unit chief, Arvinder Singh Lovely , has tendered his resignation ahead of the Lok Sabha polls . He cited the alliance with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) as one of the reasons. He said the Delhi Congress unit was against the alliance but the party high command went ahead with it.He clarified that he has only resigned as chief of the Congress' Delhi unit and is not joining any other political party.His clarification came after Congress ex-MLA Asif Mohammad Khan claimed that the BJP would field Lovely from the East Delhi constituency, replacing Harsh Malhotra.""I have only resigned as Delhi Congress chief and I am not joining any political party,"" he said at a press conference at his residence.Lovely said his resignation reflected the pain of Congress workers saddened by the fact that the ""ideals they had been fighting for during the last seven to eight years"" were being compromised.In his resignation letter addressed to Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, Lovely expressed his ""handicap"" in the role, as all unanimous decisions taken by senior Delhi unit leaders have been ""unilaterally vetoed"" by AICC Delhi in-chargeDeepak Babria .Lovely's discontentment stems partly from the Congress' decision to form an alliance with the AAP, a move that he claims the Delhi Congress unit opposed.In his letter to Kharge, Lovely said, ""It is with a heavy heart that I write the present letter to you finding myself handicapped and unable to continue as the President of the Delhi party unit.""""I had gratefully accepted the role as the DPCC President with the sole objective of supporting the local Congress party workers with whom I have an extremely close connection and life-long association.""However, since I cannot protect the interests of the party workers, I see no reason to continue in the said post. Therefore, with great regret and an extremely leaden heart, I, Arvinder Singh Lovely, do hereby tender my resignation from the post of DPCC President,"" he said.Furthermore, Lovely criticized the selection of candidates for the Lok Sabha elections, particularly targeting North East Delhi candidate Kanhaiya Kumar for praising Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, currently embroiled in a money laundering case.""The candidate from North East Delhi has also been giving media bytes falsely praising the Delhi CM, in direct contravention of the party line and the local party workers' beliefs,"" Lovely said.""In direct contradiction to the true factual position and the misery of Delhi Citizens, he endorsed the false propaganda of AAP in regard to the supposed works done by them in education, health, road and electricity sectors,"" he said.""Such ill-thought and factually incorrect statements have not gone down well"" with the Delhi Congress unit since ""the local party workers had an inherent understanding that the alliance was not done in appreciation of AAP's false propaganda of the development of Delhi,"" he said.The resignation comes amidst mounting dissatisfaction within the Congress ranks over ticket distribution and leadership decisions. Delhi BJP chief Virendra Sachdeva attributed Lovely's resignation to growing discontent among party members, while senior AAP leader Saurabh Bharadwaj viewed it as an internal matter of the Congress.The Congress and the AAP are constituents of the INDIA bloc formed by opposition parties to take on the BJP in the Lok Sabha elections. While the AAP is contesting four Lok Sabha seats in Delhi, the Congress has fielded candidates on three.The BJP had won all the seven Lok Sabha seats in Delhi in the 2014 and 2019 general elections.Sandeep Dikshit, a Congress leader, acknowledged the concerns raised by Lovely and emphasized the need to address them. With Lovely's departure, the Congress faces challenges in maintaining unity and addressing internal dissent, particularly as the Lok Sabha elections progress.Lovely, a seasoned politician, previously served as a minister in the Sheila Dikshit government and contested the 2019 Lok Sabha elections from East Delhi constituency against BJP's Gautam Gambhir and AAP's Atishi.","Congress party's Delhi unit chief, Arvinder Singh Lovely, has tendered his resignation ahead of the Lok Sabha polls.

We will transfer Rs 8,500 per month to her account,” Rahul said, while addressing an election rally at Salipur in Odisha.Rahul claimed Modi snatched money from the poor and gave it to the corporates, making some of them billionaires. “Uncle ji (Modi) stole the money meant for the poor and gave it to some 22/25 people, making them billionaires. Modi also waived off the loan of his billionaire friends to the tune of Rs 16 lakh crore,” Rahul said.He said if Congress returns to power in Delhi, it will give back the money to the poor. “If Modi made a handful of people billionaires in the last 10 years, we promise that the Congress will make crores of people millionaires across the country, if given an opportunity to serve. Modi waived off the loans of his billionaire friends. If Congress forms the govt at Centre, we will cancel the debts of farmers,” Rahul said.Recently, Modi had taken potshots at the Congress for its alleged plan to carry out a wealth survey and then redistribute assets to minorities, especially Muslims, if the party is voted to power. Modi linked Congress’s manifesto pitch of socio economic and caste survey to former PM Manmohan Singh’s 2006 speech in which he had allegedly said that if Congress is voted to power, it will take away people’s wealth and redistribute it among Muslims.Responding to Rahul’s charges, BJP said people of the country have rejected the Congress. “The Congress has lost the confidence and trust of the people.

Both the BJD and BJP are together. In Delhi, you find uncle ji running the govt for 22/25 billionaires. Naveen babu’s govt in Odisha is also for a handful and select people only,” Rahul said.The former Congress president also took a dig at Naveen, alleging his close aide and former bureaucrat V K Pandian has been running the show in Odisha. “Uncle ji and Naveen babu have given Odisha PANN — Pandian, Amit Shah, Narendra Modi, Naveen Patnaik. They have cheated the people of the country and Odisha, and looted their money. Pandian is running the state,” Rahul said, adding that just as the Congress formed the govt in Telangana by exposing the alleged nexus between BRS and BJP, the party will do the same in Odisha and come to power in the state.Reacting to the charges, BJD leader and Cuttack Lok Sabha candidate Santrupt Misra said, “People of the state have been blessing Naveen Patnaik for his good governance and development agenda since 2000, and will continue to elect him for a record sixth term.”Speaking to reporters, BJD Rajya Sabha member and party’s national spokesperson Sasmit Patra said, “Rahul’s visit will not have any impact on the electoral fortunes of Odisha Congress. It may only motivate Congress cadres who have been consistently losing in elections.”Refuting Rahul’s allegation of BJD-BJP partnership, BJP said the Congress leader’s election rally will have little impact on the electorate. “People of Odisha have decided to vote BJP to power in the state and at the Centre. People of the state want double-engine sarkar (BJP govt in state and Centre) for a speedy growth,” state BJP president Manmohan Samal said.Rahul made a host of promises at the public meeting, including crop loan waiver for farmers and replication of Karnataka’s Gruha Laxmi scheme, offering a monthly assistance of Rs 2,000 to women heads of households, if the party forms the govt in Odisha.Highlighting the party’s election manifesto, Rahul promised bonus for farmers along with minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 3,000 per quintal for paddy. Besides waiver of agricultural loan, the Congress also offered a monthly pension of Rs 2,000 for farmers. Reiterating Congress’s plan of launching ‘pehli naukri pakki’ in the country, Rahul said the party, if voted to power, will ensure guaranteed apprenticeship of all degree/diploma holders with a stipend of Rs 1 lakh per year.","Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Sunday branded Narendra Modi and Naveen Patnaik as ‘ partners ’ who are committed to work for the welfare of the rich.

Saying that the BJD’s days are numbered, Nadda said there is a need to dislodge the Naveen govt and elect the BJP.“BJD govt stands for corruption.

Other members of the CEC also supported the UP request. It was said there is a strong sentiment among workers that Rahul and Priyanka should take charge.The meeting was chaired by Kharge and attended by Sonia Gandhi, KC Venugopal, Madhusudan Mistry, Salman Khurshid, Uttam Reddy, Amee Yajnik. The CEC also discussed the pending five seats of Punjab with state president Amarinder Warring and leader of opposition Partap Bajwa.A similar plea for Rahul and Priyanka was made in the CEC meeting on March 21, and it was decided that the Gandhi family and the party brass will take a call on the issue. Sources said the proposal presented on Saturday was an updated version of what was earlier submitted to the CEC, with revised information about the “current public sentiment and party’s preparedness” on the high-profile seats. The UP unit assured the CEC that the cadres and the party unit are “all set” to launch the campaign the moment the leaders decide on contesting.Interestingly, Rahul is likely to visit Amethi on May 2 or 3, which is the last date of nomination. This has only heightened the anticipation in the party.Party leaders rate the chances of Rahul contesting very high, but uncertainty prevails over Priyanka’s electoral plunge. What is also being speculated is the party pitching Priyanka from Amethi against local MP and Union minister Smriti Irani, who defeated Rahul in 2019.While it was expected that Congress will release the list of candidates on Saturday night after the CEC meeting, sources said the suspense may linger on for a few more days.

He also expressed displeasure over the choice of Kanhaiya Kumar as Congress candidate from North East Delhi and Udit Raj from North West Delhi.This is not the first time that Lovely has sprung a surprise. In 2017, he quit the party and joined BJP, but later returned to Congress in 2018.Lovely said all unanimous decisions taken by senior Delhi Congress functionaries had been unilaterally vetoed by AICC general secretary Delhi in-charge (Deepak Babaria), and the state unit was not even intimated about the decisions, including the Lok Sabha candidate selections. Lovely, who was appointed state president last year, said even though the Delhi Congress unit was against the alliance with AAP, he publicly backed it and ensured that the entire unit ""fell in line with the high command's final order"". ""The Delhi Congress unit was against an alliance with a party that was formed on the sole basis of levelling false, fabricated, and mala fide corruption charges against Congress... half of the cabinet ministers (of AAP) are currently in jail on corruption charges. Despite that, the party (Congress) made a decision to ally with AAP in Delhi. We respected the party's final decision... I even went to the extent of visiting CM (Arvind) Kejriwal's residence on the night of his arrest along with Subhash Chopra and Sandeep Dikshit, despite the same being against my position on the matter,"" he said.As alliance partners in Delhi, AAP is fighting for four seats: East, New Delhi, South, and West, while Congress is contesting the remaining three—North East, North West, and Chandni Chowk.""Since my appointment as DPCC president, the AICC general secretary Delhi in-charge has not allowed me to make any senior appointments in DPCC. My request for appointment of a veteran leader as media head of DPCC was blatantly rejected. Till date, he has not allowed DPCC to appoint all block presidents in the city. Resultantly, more than 150 blocks in Delhi do not have a block president,"" Lovely said.He alleged that Babaria forced him to suspend senior party functionary Raj Kumar Chauhan. “Instead of calming the situation, he further, at public meetings, entered into numerous heated exchanges with Sandeep Dikshit, (ex-MP), Raj Kumar Chauhan (ex-Delhi minister), Bhisham Sharma (ex-MLA) and Surender Kumar (ex-MLA),"" he wrote in his letter.AAP functionaries were in a wait-and-watch mode and largely refrained from commenting on the developments. Minister Saurabh Bharadwaj, however, said, ""Congress is our alliance partner, and this is the internal matter of the party; hence, I believe it's better that they (Congress) speak about it.""Lovely also criticised Congress’s North East Delhi candidate Kanhaiya Kumar for heaping praise on CM Kejriwal, who has been arrested in an alleged money laundering case related to Delhi excise policy.""The candidate from North East Delhi has also been giving media bytes falsely praising Delhi CM, in direct contravention of the party line and the local party workers' beliefs. In direct contradiction to the true factual position and the misery of Delhi citizens, he endorsed the false propaganda of AAP regarding the supposed work done by them in education, health, road, and electricity sectors,"" he said.""Such ill-thought and factually incorrect statements have not gone down well with the Delhi Congress unit since the local party workers had an inherent understanding that the alliance was not done in appreciation of AAP's false propaganda of the development of Delhi… but (as) a compromise to improve the chances of victory for Congress in the Lok Sabha polls.”Lovely added: ""It appears that the North East Delhi candidate is unaware of the fact that, admittedly, the condition of schools, hospitals and public infrastructure in Delhi, under AAP govt, has severely worsened compared with the development work done under the late Sheila Dikshit Ji's Congress regime,"" Lovely said.","Delhi Congress chief Arvinder Singh Lovely quit his post Sunday.

MYSURU: While beneficiaries are thrilled, BJP is crying foul over the state’s decision to pay two instalments of monetary assistance under the Gruha Lakshmi scheme in April, insisting it was done to sway voters ahead of Friday’s (April 26) Lok Sabha elections in South Karnataka Many Gruha Lakshmi beneficiaries say they got Rs 2,000 on April 13 and again on April 23.A beneficiary said, normally, assistance for the previous months is released around the 13th of the subsequent month.P Maramkaiah, Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha functionary, said many women got assistance for March and April in April. “It is not an election issue. However, many are thankful to the state govt for launching such a scheme,” he said.A beneficiary said: “Because of school holidays, household expenses have increased. The govt’s decision to release money early is very helpful. It has nothing to do with elections.”But BJP said it amounts to malpractice and questioned the timing of the release. The argument comes in the wake of data showing more women than men voted in three Lok Sabha constituencies in the Old Mysuru region.In Hassan , about 20,000 more women than men voted, while in Mysore, 7.4 lakh women voted against 7.3 lakh men. In Mandya, 11,983 more women cast their votes compared to their male counterparts.Pushpa Amarnath, vice-president, Guarantee Scheme Implementation Committee, said there was “no connection” between voting and release of assistance. “The govt makes allocations when funds are available,” she said. “This sum has become a lifeline for women especially, the poor. They need the money to face challenges posed by drought.”She dared BJP to announce a pro-people scheme like slashing rates of LPG refills. “Who stopped BJP from ensuring that its central govt was propeople?” she asked.But BJP insisted that it is nothing but “election malpractice”. “Releasing Rs 2,000 just before voting day is nothing but corruption ,” said CT Ravi, former MLA.","Many Gruha Lakshmi beneficiaries say they got Rs 2,000 on April 13 and again on April 23.

"Too little, too late: Congress on drought relief to Karnataka",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/too-little-too-late-congress-on-drought-relief-to-karnataka/articleshow/109676356.cms,"Double standards: BJP

BENGALURU: A day after the Narendra Modi-led Union govt announced drought relief of Rs 3,454 crore, Congress members, led by chief minister Siddaramaiah and his deputy DK Shivakumar , held protests in Bengaluru calling it “too little, too late”.Congress functionaries pointed out that the BJP govt at the Centre delayed relief by nearly seven months and it released funds only because of a nudge from the Supreme Court .“As per our memorandum submitted to the Centre in September, losses our farmers and people suffered were pegged at Rs 35,000 crore,” said Siddaramaiah. “We had sought drought relief of Rs 18,174 crore. But the Union govt did not provide any relief and now they have released a meagre amount. We are protesting this injustice.” Siddaramaiah said the amount “was not even 20%” of the demand which Karnataka had placed.In a response to BJP jibes, Shivakumar said Karnataka was “not begging for money” and insisted that it was only Congress’ guarantee schemes that was helping people tide through “this time of crisis”.“I assure you that the four-crore people of Karnataka can survive primarily on Congress’ guarantees that provide Rs 2,000 per month to women heads of families, 200 units of free power, 10kg of rice and free bus travel for women,” he said.BJP hit back with opposition leader R Ashoka on Sunday saying the Siddaramaiah-led Congress govt had handed “a beggar’s bowl” (chippu in Kannada) to the people of Karnataka, while the Modi-led govt at the Centre was “generous” with its drought relief.“Siddaramaiah has become Sulluramaiah (lying Ramaiah),” Ashoka said. “Like Ravana, who had 10 heads, Siddaramaiah has 10 tongues. He had earlier said the state govt had sought Rs 4,860 crore drought relief from the Centre based on guidelines. After the Centre granted Rs 3,454 crore, he is now leading a protest seeking Rs 18,172 crore. Both Siddaramaiah and DK Shivakumar are resorting to double standards. The Congress govt should go, otherwise the state will be ruined.”He said the state govt had sought Rs 1,147 crore drought relief in 2004-2005, but the then Congress govt led by Manmohan Singh granted only Rs 63 crore. He said the state govt had sought Rs 406 crore in 2007-2008 for flood relief, but the Centre did not grant any money.","Congress members, led by chief minister Siddaramaiah and his deputy DK Shivakumar, held protests in Bengaluru calling it “too little, too late’ Shivak Kumar said Karnataka was “not begging for money” and insisted that it was only Congress’ guarantee schemes that was helping people tide through ‘this time of crisis’","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109676395,imgsize-150706,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/109676395.jpg"

ED lied in court about insulin requirements of Arvind Kejriwal, says Delhi minister Atishi

At a press conference, Atishi accused ED of misinforming about Kejriwal's insulin needs, referencing an AIIMS diet chart. Tihar arranged a 40-minute consultation for suggestions and reassurance on medications.

NEW DELHI: Hitting out at Election Commission of India for asking the party to modify its campaign song, AAP minister Atishi on Sunday claimed that it didn’t not violate any rules. She accused EC of being “another political weapon of BJP” and stated that this was probably the first time in India’s history that a party's election campaign song had been banned.Atishi accused EC of “inaction” when BJP “violates the model code of conduct on a daily basis”. She further claimed that EC objected to the song mentioning fraudulent arrests but didn’t take action to prevent attacks on the opposition or change the heads of investigative agencies during elections. “You (EC) would not change the head of CBI, you would not change ED's director or IT's director during elections, you would not do anything to stop the attack on the opposition. But if someone mentions in their campaign that fraudulent arrests are being made, then EC takes objection to it,” Atishi said.Atishi highlighted that AAP's campaign song didn’t mention BJP by name, yet EC believed that talking about dictatorship was a criticism of the party at helm at Centre.
