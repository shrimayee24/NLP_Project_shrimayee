NDA has option to fill 4 more nominated seats

NEW DELHI: NDA will further improve its tally in the Upper House of Parliament as resignation of one more YSRCP Rajya Sabha member, V Vijayasai Reddy - the fourth since the party's rout in 2024 assembly elections - would give the BJP-led alliance one additional seat in the imminent by-election. Reddy, leader of the party in the House, resigned on Saturday.Earlier, three resignations had helped NDA partner TDP open its account last Dec with two seats in Rajya Sabha. Its strength had reduced to zero after its dismal performance in the previous assembly polls in 2019. One of the three vacant seats went to BJP, which currently has 98 MPs in Rajya Sabha.Though NDA has already crossed the majority mark in the Upper House with the help of two Independents and six nominated members, gain of an extra seat will further cement its position in the Rajya Sabha whether it goes to TDP or its partner in the state assembly Jana Sena Party or BJP.Besides, the ruling alliance at Centre still has an option to get four more nominated members on board if govt decides to fill those four vacant seats under the nominated category.Nominated members invariably go with govt during passing of any legislation or resolution. There are provisions of 12 nominated members in Rajya Sabha.Since two — Gulam Ali and Satnam Singh Sandhu — of the eight nominated MPs in the current House had joined BJP after being nominated by the President, they are counted under the party’s head in the list and have to go by its whip.Another round of vacancies will arise in June-July when two Rajya Sabha members from Assam (one from BJP and other from AGP) will retire in June and six members from Tamil Nadu (three from DMK and one each from AIADMK, PMK and MDMK) will retire in July.BJP will retain its seat from Assam while DMK may improve its tally by gaining one extra seat in by-election in June/July. AIADMK will also be able to retain its seat.","V Vijayasai Reddy, leader of the party in the House, resigned on Saturday.

"Uttarakhand MLA & predecessor gun for each other, bullets fly",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/uttarakhand-mla-predecessor-gun-for-each-other-bullets-fly/articleshow/117586586.cms,"Champion, Kumar in bitter rivalry since 2022 U’khand polls

ROORKEE/DEHRADUN: Making a mockery of the law, two senior politicians in Uttarakhand - Kunwar Pranav Singh Champion , former MLA from Khanpur and a BJP member, and the independent MLA from the same seat, Umesh Kumar - went at each other with loaded weapons, even as their supporters clashed, spreading fear and panic in the region on Sunday.A video of the incident, which evoked widespread condemnation, showed Champion, along with more than two dozen supporters, storming the camp office-cum-residence of Kumar in a gang-war style shootout, firing gunshots, heckling the MLA's staff and beating up people. Champion could be seen in the footage loading an assault rifle, firing shots and walking around Kumar's office premises with a rifle in one hand and a pistol in the other.A member of Kumar's staff, Rao Imran, allegedly sustained head injuries in the scuffle and was taken to hospital. Before cops could arrive, Champion and his supporters had left the spot. Later in the day, Kumar's personal secretary, Zubair Kazmi, lodged a complaint against Champion at Roorkee's Civil Lines police station alleging that around 100 rounds were fired, of which 70 empty bullet covers had been recovered. The ex-MLA and four of his supporters were subsequently arrested from Dehradun. Doon SSP Ajai Singh told TOI that they were in the process of being handed over to Haridwar police under whose jurisdiction the area falls.Meanwhile, soon after the attack at his camp office, Umesh Kumar, who was not present during the altercation, reached the spot.Police officers had also reached by then. The already-tense situation intensified when Kumar’s supporters began shouting slogans against Kunwar Pranav Singh Champion, and Kumar attempted to rush toward Champion’s residence, barely 300 metres away from his place, wielding a pistol.Police officers had to intervene and restrain him physically, all of which was captured on video.The incident, coming barely days before the scheduled visit of PM Narendra Modi to attend the opening ceremony of the 38th national games in Dehradun on Tuesday, has stirred up the political environment in the hill state, where such brazen acts of violence amongst lawmakers are rarely seen.Both Champion and Kumar have been engaged in bitter rivalry since 2022 when Kumar wrested the Khanpur seat from the control of the BJP legislator, who had represented it for four terms, and had fielded his wife against Kumar in the assembly polls.The duo had often been engaging in verbal slug-fests on social media besides fighting cases against each other in court. A couple of days ago, Champion had put up a post referring to Kumar as “an illegitimate child”.Soon after, Kumar and his supporters stormed into Champion’s ancestral home in Landaura, hurling abuses and challenging him to come outside and face them.After his arrest from Nehru Colony in Dehradun, Champion told mediapersons that he was forced to react since Kumar had “challenged him”.","Kunwar Pranav Singh Champion, former MLA from Khanpur and a BJP member, and the independent MLA from the same seat, Umesh Kumar - went at each other with loaded weapons.

Hakim’s comments

Parents' allegations

Background

NEW DELHI: West Bengal minister Firhad Hakim on Sunday accused the parents of the RG Kar hospital victim of maligning Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for political motives. His remarks followed similar allegations by Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader Kunal Ghosh, who claimed that the parents were being ""used"" by groups aiming to discredit the Mamata Banerjee government.Speaking at a Republic Day event, Hakim expressed sympathy for the parents but criticized their statements against the chief minister. ""I share the parents’ pain and anguish but targeting the CM without reason is unacceptable. The CM was elected by popular mandate, not by those using the parents as puppets for their agenda,"" said Hakim, who also serves as the mayor of Kolkata.He further alleged that the parents were ""mouthing scripted lines"" provided by vested interests.The victim's parents have publicly accused the Kolkata Police and hospital authorities of attempting to destroy evidence in their daughter’s rape and murder case . They also criticized the CBI for failing to uncover a larger conspiracy behind the crime.""We believe the CM has utterly failed. We have every right to express our feelings,"" the victim's father said at a meeting organized by the 'Abhaya Manch' platform.The case concerns the rape and murder of a 31-year-old post-graduate trainee doctor at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital in August last year. Her body was found in a seminar hall. On January 20, a trial court sentenced Sanjay Roy, the lone convict, to life imprisonment.While the victim's family continues to demand justice and allege systemic failure, ruling party leaders have dismissed their claims as politically motivated.","West Bengal minister Firhad Hakim accused parents of maligning Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.
