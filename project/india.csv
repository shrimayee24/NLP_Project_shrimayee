NEW DELHI: The Karnataka High Court dismissed a ""frivolous"" criminal case on Tuesday against a man accused of stealing a cat named 'Daisy'.During the post-lunch hearing, Justice M Nagaprasanna commented with amusement: ""Cat named Daisy has driven everyone crazy"".The proceedings against Taha Husain were terminated after he stated that his neighbour had lodged a false police complaint accusing him of taking her cat.The petitioner approached the high court in 2023 to dismiss the case, which was heard on July 23, 2024. Justice Nagaprasanna provided temporary relief by suspending all legal actions against Husain.The court stated: ""Permitting further proceedings in such frivolous cases will clog the criminal justice system.""In July 2024, police filed a chargesheet following the FIR. Husain faced charges under Sections 504, 506 and 509 of the Indian Penal Code for criminal intimidation, breach of peace, and insulting the modesty of woman. The police cited CCTV evidence showing the cat inside Husain's residence at a particular time.The defence lawyer argued that cats naturally enter and leave houses through windows, which should not be considered a criminal act.","Karnataka High Court dismisses a ""frivolous"" criminal case against a man.

'Is This Your Achievement?': Oppn Trashes Development Claims As BJP Celebrates 11 Years Of Modi Govt

Poll Do you believe the position of Deputy Speaker should be filled promptly? Yes, it's essential for democracy No, it's not a priority right now

NEW DELHI: Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge , who is also the Rajya Sabha leader of opposition, wrote to PM Narendra Modi on Tuesday, urging him to hold the election of the Lok Sabha Deputy Speaker.Highlighting the vacant status of the position for the two consecutive Lok Sabha terms, Kharge said this ""does not augur well for India's democratic polity and is also in violation of well-laid-out provisions of the Constitution"".""From the First to the Sixteenth Lok Sabha, every House has had a Deputy Speaker. By and large, it has been a well-established convention to appoint the Deputy Speaker from among the members of the principal opposition party,"" Kharge wrote on X with a letter he wrote to the PM.He further wrote: ""No Deputy Speaker was elected during the Seventeenth Lok Sabha, and this concerning precedent continues in the ongoing Eighteenth Lok Sabha.""The Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha is a key constitutional position in India’s lower house of Parliament.The Deputy Speaker is elected by the members of the Lok Sabha, usually from among themselves, soon after the Speaker is elected. The primary role of the Deputy Speaker is to preside over the proceedings of the Lok Sabha in the absence of the Speaker and to ensure the smooth conduct of the House. The Deputy Speaker has the same powers as the Speaker when presiding, including maintaining order, deciding on points of order, and managing debates.Importantly, the Deputy Speaker is expected to function in a non-partisan manner, similar to the Speaker, despite being elected from a political party. Traditionally, this post is often offered to a member of the opposition or another party to maintain a balance, although this is not mandated by the Constitution.The position is significant for upholding the parliamentary process and ensuring continuity in the functioning of the Lok Sabha when the Speaker is unavailable.The last Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha in India was M. Thambi Durai from the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK). He served as the Deputy Speaker during the 16th Lok Sabha (2014–2019).","Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge wrote to PM Narendra Modi on Tuesday, urging him to hold the election of the Lok Sabha Deputy Speaker.

Meghalaya honeymoon murder: Social media post from Raja Raghuvanshi's account confirmed cops' suspicions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/meghalaya-honeymoon-murder-social-media-post-from-raja-raghuvanshis-account-confirmed-cops-suspicions/articleshow/121765516.cms,"GUWAHATI/SHILLONG: A honeymoon without a single photo. That was the first clue.Meghalaya Police SIT began suspecting foul play when they noticed newlyweds Raja & Sonam Raghuvanshi hadn't posted any pictures from their scenic trip to the northeast. That silence online opened the lid on what turned out to be a planned murder - a case codenamed unofficially by police as Operation Honeymoon.Raja Raghuvanshi, 28, a transporter from Indore, was found dead on June 2 in a gorge near Weisawdong Falls in Meghalaya's East Khasi Hills. He had disappeared on May 23 along with 24-year-old Sonam, who reappeared at a roadside dhaba in UP's Ghazipur in the early hours of June 9. She was arrested, brought to Shillong Tuesday, and will be produced before a court on Wednesday.he couple had married on May 11 and left days later for Guwahati, telling family they planned to visit the Kamakhya temple. On May 20, they reached Meghalaya. Three days later, both vanished. A rented scooter, abandoned near Shillong-Cherrapunji route, was found on May 24. It would take a nine-day search to locate Raja's body. A ""dao"" (machete) and phone lay nearby, with a blood-stained raincoat found a few km away.As SIT sifted through 42 surveillance videos and behaviour profiles, suspicions deepened. Footage placed Sonam meeting the alleged killers just 10km from the crime scene. The clincher came when a social media post appeared on Raja's account at 2.15am - hours after his death. Police said it was a red herring, likely posted by someone else to throw investigators off track.The conspiracy began well before the trip. Sonam, who returned to her parental home on May 15, allegedly resumed contact with her alleged lover Raj Kushwaha. Next day, Raj allegedly met three childhood friends - Akash Rajput, Vishal Singh Chauhan, and Anand Kurmi - at a restaurant in Indore. The murder plan was allegedly sealed that evening.Raj stayed behind in Indore. The three boarded a train to Guwahati via Delhi and arrived in Shillong on May 21, police said. For the next two days, they allegedly tailed the couple with help from Sonam, who kept sending live locations. She is accused of luring Raja to secluded spots for photos, giving her co-conspirators the window they needed.Sonam's raincoat, handed to Akash, was found at crime scene.","Raja Raghuvanshi, 28, a transporter from Indore, was found dead on June 2 in a gorge near Weisawdong Falls in Meghalaya's East Khasi Hills.
