NEW DELHI: Stepping up its attack on govt over the rollback of MGNREGA , Congress held protests at its district headquarters Sunday. This came a day after Congress Parliamentary Party chairperson Sonia Gandhi , in a video message, accused the Modi govt of ""bulldozing"" MGNREGA and asserted that the ""black law"" that seeks to repeal it will be defied by lakhs of party workers across the country.Earlier in the day, Congress leaders accused the Modi govt of ""effectively dismantling MGNREGA - by converting it from a right to a favour"" and ""desecration of this groundbreaking law in Parliament over the last week"". Meanwhile, the Left parties - CPI(M), CPI, CPI(ML) Liberation, Revolutionary Socialist Party and All India Forward Bloc - have given a call for a joint protest on Monday.In a post on X, Congress general secretary (organisation) KC Venugopal said that the party held nationwide protests in solidarity with ""workers whose livelihoods and dignity are under attack"".""MGNREGA was a legal right to work, not a welfare handout. By capping funds, centralising control and altering its demand-driven nature, BJP has turned this right into a budget-dependent scheme, pushing crores of rural families into insecurity and distress,"" Venugopal said, adding Congress Working Committee on Dec 27 will decide the future course of action.Calling MGNREGA ""a lifeline for the poor"", party president Mallikarjun Kharge accused govt of ""purposely destroying the Act"" and alleged that the ruling dispensation ""wants to make the poor villagers and farm labourers slaves of the rich"".","Congress held protests at its district headquarters Sunday.

30 Dead, Several Injured in Jammu as Heavy Rains Trigger Landslide After Chenab River Overflowed

A court in J&K’s Reasi district dismissed a plea seeking an FIR against Vaishno Devi shrine board officials for the death of 35 pilgrims in a landslide on the tracks to the site on Aug 26, ruling that a natural disaster was responsible for the tragedy.The PIL urged the registration of a police case under BNS Sections 105 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) and 106 (causing death by rash or negligent acts) against the shrine board CEO and other officials for allegedly ignoring “adverse weather” warnings and red alerts in the state, which amounted to criminal negligence.JMFC Katra Sidhant Vaid nixed the plea, noting that the pilgrimage had been halted from time to time when required and SOPs were followed to ensure public safety. “The case of criminal negligence is not made out, and no cognisable offence is prima facie made out,” he said.The judge, however, clarified that the court’s observations would not have any bearing on the inquiry ordered into the mishap by Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha days after the accident.Following the Aug 26 landslide, the Vaishno Devi pilgrimage remained suspended for 22 days.",A court in J&K’s Reasi district dismissed a plea seeking an FIR against Vaishno Devi shrine board officials for the death of 35 pilgrims in a landslide.

Maharashtra local body election: Mahayuti reinforces dominance; BJP storms 2 Shiv Sena bastions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thane/maharashtra-local-body-election-mahayuti-reinforces-dominance-bjp-storms-2-shiv-sena-bastions/articleshow/126113293.cms,"The BJP-led Mahayuti alliance asserted dominance in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region following local election victories

THANE/NAVI MUMBAI:

BJP-Led Mahayuti Sweeps Maharashtra Local Body Polls; PM Modi, CM Fadnavis Hail Victory

The BJP-led Mahayuti alliance’s decisive local election victory on Sunday reinforced its political dominance in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) after the 2024 assembly elections.BJP trumped deputy CM Eknath Shinde’s Shiv Sena in its bastions of Ambernath and Badlapur in Thane district by wresting control of the municipal council president posts. BJP’s Tejashree Karanjule Patil defeated exmunicipal council president Manisha Walekar of Sena by a margin of more than 6,000 votes. BJP candidate Pawan Walekar, whose office was targeted in a firing incident three days before Ambernath went to polls, defeated his cousin, Nikhil, an ex-corporator and the son of Shiv Sena city president Arvind Walekar.Although Sena improved its tally to 27 seats from 24 in 2015, the loss of the directly elected president’s post has effectively shifted control of the council to BJP. According to political observers, Sena’s defeat in Ambernath, which is represented by Shinde’s MP son Shrikant Shinde, was due to deep-rooted factionalism within the party and Congress cutting into its traditional vote base in key pockets.Congress showed improved performance in Ambernath, increasing its seat count from eight in 2015 to 12 seats under the leadership of city president Pradeep Patil.NCP (SP) snatched Uran and neighbouring Karjat from the Mahayuti, dealing a blow to BJP MLA Mahesh Baladi in Uran and Sena MLA Mahendra Thorve in Karjat.In Palghar district, Sena secured the municipal council president posts in Palghar and Dahanu, while BJP captured Jawhar municipal council and Wada nagar panchayat. In Dahanu, Shiv Sena candidate Rajendra Machhi defeated BJP’s Bharat Rajput by 4,055 votes.In Badlapur, BJP’s Ruchita Ghorpade secured a decisive victory in the direct presidential election, defeating Shiv Sena leader Waman Mhatre’s wife Veena by a margin of over 7,000 votes. The result was seen as a prestige battle, especially as Sena contested the election on its own,while BJP fought in alliance with the Ajit Pawar-led NCP.While both BJP and Shiv Sena won 23 seats each in the 49member council, BJP’s capture of the president’s post has tilted the balance of power in its favour.","BJP trumped deputy CM Eknath Shinde’s Shiv Sena in its bastions of Ambernath and Badlapur in Thane district.

MUMBAI: Thanking the people of Maharashtra for BJP’s resounding victory in the municipal council and nagar panchayat elections on Sunday, CM Devendra Fadnavis told the media in Nagpur: “I had predicted that 75% of the nagar [council] presidents will be from Mahayuti and the poll results endorse it. Nearly 3,300 corporators are from the Mahayuti.Once again BJP is the number one party with 48% of the nagar presidents.” Pointing out that the Mahayuti alliance has repeated the assembly results, he predicted: “We shall do much better in the municipal corporation elections.”Describing the poll outcome as a “trailer” for the larger civic battles ahead, deputy CM and Shiv Sena chief Ekanth Shinde said Sunday’s results signalled that BJP would “score a century”, while Shiv Sena would notch up a “half-century with a strong strike rate” in the upcoming polls.Shinde said the mandate proved that Shiv Sena was no longer confined to Thane or Mumbai, but had expanded its footprint across Maharashtra, including smaller towns and regions like Konkan and Raigad. In an apparent swipe at Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray, Shinde said voters preferred leaders who work onthe ground and “those sitting at home met the same fate”.He added that the total number of seats won by the opposition was even less than the tally secured by Shiv Sena alone in the recent local body elections.Deputy CM and NCP chief Ajit Pawar, who proved his dominance over Baramati and Pune district as the polls delivered a clear win for his faction in the first civic contest sincethe party’s split, said one must see whom the people are standing with.Crediting Fadnavis’s transparent governance and peopleoriented decisions as having played a decisive role in BJP’s resounding win, state party chief Ravindra Chavan said the opposition was visibly missing on the ground during the campaign.He said the quick compensation paid by govt to farmers was acknowledged, as they ensured Mahayuti’s win.","BJP-Led Mahayuti Sweeps Maharashtra Local Body Polls; PM Modi, CM Fadnavis Hail Victory.
