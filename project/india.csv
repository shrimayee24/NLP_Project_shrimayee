BJP: Opposition looks negatively towards backward states,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-opposition-looks-negatively-towards-backward-states/articleshow/111997565.cms,"NEW DELHI: BJP on Wednesday slammed Congress and other opposition parties for criticising the Union budget , saying that it revealed their political frustration and negative attitude towards ""some backward states "" that need special focus and assistance for development.BJP spokesperson and former Rajya Sabha MP G V L Narasimha Rao said Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led govt's Budget has been welcomed by ""one and all"" but the opposition parties are coming out with ""immature and negative reactions"" against it.Party's reaction comes against the backdrop of Congress and other constituents of the opposition INDIA bloc accusing govt of presenting a ""discriminatory"" Budget towards opposition-ruled states after finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman made a host of budgetary announcements for Andhra Pradesh and Bihar on Tuesday.JD(U) and TDP, which rule Bihar and Andhra Pradesh respectively, are key constituents of BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) govt at the Centre.""The entire country looks at this as a progressive, pro-people, pro-poor, pro-farmer and pro-employement budget. It is a Budget which has actually laid out a vision for 'Viksit Bharat',"" Rao said at a press conference.With more than Rs 48 lakh crore overall budgetary expenditure, the Union Budget 2024-25 has kept its focus on every section of the society and every state in the country, he said, adding special focus has been given to backward states, particularly eastern regions, for their development.""But, allocations have been made to some states keeping in view their developmental needs and long neglect,"" Rao said in an apparent reference to budgetary announcements made by the finance minister for Bihar and Andhra Pradesh.He said Andhra Pradesh certainly needed special financial assistance because of the ravages of the division and bifurcation the state suffered due to Congress.Rao said Congress, which is criticising the budget, had in its manifesto mentioned that it would give special category state status to Andhra Pradesh if voted to power.""They make such kind of hollow promises because they do realise that they betrayed the people of Andhra Pradesh and they cannot get out of it. They have been reduced to 1% vote share party in Andhra Pradesh (in recent elections),"" the BJP functionary said.","BJP says opposition parties are coming out with ""immature and negative reactions"" against it. Party's reaction comes against the backdrop of Congress and other constituents of the opposition INDIA bloc accusing govt of presenting a ""discriminatory"" Budget towards opposition-ruled states.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111997567,imgsize-56884,width-400,resizemode-4/111997567.jpg"

You people have been protesting since Tuesday while we have been fighting for it (special status) since 2010.""The CM also reminded everyone that the hike in reservation wouldn't have happened had he not taken the initiative.""It was at my behest that you all agreed to a caste survey, after which quotas for SCs, STs, OBCs and the extremely backward classes were hiked to 65% in govt jobs and educational institutions,"" he said.""Your protest has no meaning.

"CM’s proactive approach surprises many: Amid talk of rift, Yogi Adityanath moves ahead of party in UP bypoll preparations",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/amid-talk-of-rift-yogi-moves-ahead-of-party-in-bypoll-preparations/articleshow/111997279.cms,"Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath

LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath has taken the lead in preparations for upcoming byelections to 10 assembly seats, expected to be held later this year. He has formed a team of ministers to look after preparations even before the BJP organisation has started its own groundwork.This proactive approach has surprised many but analysts believe the outcome of the bypolls , after the party's lacklustre showing in the Lok Sabha elections, will have a direct impact on Yogi's image, and hence he is leading from the front.At the first meeting of 16 ministers, he tasked them with winning all 10 seats.Although the appointments have been made in consultation with the UP BJP leadership, including its chief Bhupendra Chaudhary and general secretary (organisation) Dharampal Singh, insiders emphasise that Yogi's decision to form the team should be seen as a proactive approach to improve BJP's tally. A couple of days after Yogi put the ministers in charge, BJP held a meeting and appointed its own in-charges. Analysts believe the bypolls will be a litmus test for Yogi's governance and UP BJP's organisational strength. It will also provide an opportunity to quell rumours of differences between the govt and organisation in UP before central leadership takes action in view of the LS poll debacle.Yogi's proactiveness is evident as he has not only appointed the ministers in charge but has also taken stock of the situation in these seats after receiving feedback from ministers. BJP is not in a comfortable position in the 10 seats where bypolls are to be held if one goes by its performance in the 2022 assembly polls. Of the 10 seats, Samajwadi Party had 5, BJP had 3, and its alliance partners NISHAD Party and RLD had one each.",Yogi Adityanath has taken the lead in preparations for upcoming byelections to 10 assembly seats.

The opposition offensive against the Budget seeks to paint the governing party as beholden to its demanding allies TDP and JDU from Andhra and Bihar at the cost of others.

Sources said Rahul specifically told the members to focus on what their respective states have not got in the Budget, rather than speaking about what others have got. The party decided to accommodate maximum states through MPs in its allocated four hours discussion time. The choice of Haryana veteran Kumari Selja as the lead speaker and then Praniti Shinde of Maharashtra was to showcase the election states.

The party has 11 Rajya Sabha members and four Lok Sabha MPs at present.Given the situation, the INDIA bloc of parties did not waste an opportunity on Wednesday to reach out to YSRCP, which can be seen as an attempt to increase numbers in the opposition benches, instead the treasury benches gaining from it.That the ruling NDA stands short of majority in Rajya Sabha at present, makes it inevitable for BJP to try for the extra numbers from the unaligned parties, to pass Bills and motions in the House.While Naveen Patnaik’s BJD like YSRCP, had remained unattached from ruling or opposition coalitions earlier, and voted with the BJP government, after the June 4 defeat, for both parties in their respective states, BJD has announced going with the opposition parties.With the recent trend of MPs jumping ship from opposition to ruling sides, YSRCP is also alert on keeping its flock together, and not lose them to TDP or BJP, who would want to increase its strength in the House.Speaking at the dharna, Yadav said, ""I would not have known the truth had I not seen the photographs and videos. Those in power should maintain simplicity, listen to others, and not take their lives."" Raut called for an “independent investigation” and several leaders, including Haq and Chaturvedi, urged the governor of Andhra Pradesh and the Supreme Court to take note of the matter.In response, TDP MPs held a press conference and accused Reddy of ""diversion politics"".
