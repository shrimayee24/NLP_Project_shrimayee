""Union home minister Amit Shah never said there would be a coalition govt in Tamil Nadu after the election. We only said we are part of an alliance. We never said we would form a coalition govt. Why is DMK irritated when we form an alliance? DMK is afraid. Even Amit Shah didn't mention coalition governance. He said, 'Modi for Delhi' and referred to me for Tamil Nadu (to lead the alliance),"" Palaniswami said.Meanwhile, responding to Palaniswami's remarks, Tamil Nadu BJP state chief Nainar Nagenthran said the BJP brass would decide the issue of forming a coalition govt in Tamil Nadu. ""Decision of forming a coalition govt will be taken by Amit Shah and the AIADMK secretary at the right time,"" Nagenthran said.During a visit to Chennai, Shah had said decisions regarding seat-sharing and ministry allocations would be made ""at an appropriate time"" in consultation with alliance partners.Palaniswami said political parties must respect each other's autonomy and their right to make decisions in their own best interests. He said alliances are a natural part of democratic politics and should not be a source of undue controversy. ""Governing party's discomfort reflects its lack of confidence in its governance and electoral prospects. Instead of focusing on AIADMK's strategic decisions, DMK should concentrate on its own performance,"" he said.

NEW DELHI: As former Jammu and Kashmir CM Farooq Abdullah cries 'betrayal' over former RAW secretary and 'friend' A S Dulat 's claim in his latest book that the senior Abdullah had privately supported the abrogation of Article 370 in J&K, the ex-spymaster has clarified that all that he meant to convey is that Farooq always wanted to be on the right side of Delhi, albeit on his own terms.""If he is saying I have betrayed him, he possibly has not read the book. The book is not a critique but praises Farooq Abdullah for the leader he is. As former Intelligence Bureau (IB) chief and my ex-boss M K Narayanan says in the foreword of 'The Chief Minister and The Spy', Abdullah is one of the tallest leaders in Kashmir and the country. And I stand by that,"" Dulat told TOI on Thursday.In the chapter 'Abrogation and its Aftermath', Dulat writes that Farooq Abdullah was terribly hurt by the Modi govt's Aug 5, 2019 decision to nullify Article 370 in J&K. ""Just as the BJP had never hidden its intentions towards Kashmir as far as Article 370 was concerned, so, too, had Farooq been extremely open about his willingness to work with New Delhi. Maybe, he said, the National Conference could even have had the proposal passed in the legislative assembly in Jammu and Kashmir. 'We would have helped,' he told me when I met him in 2020. 'Why were we not taken into confidence?"" wrote the former spy.Farooq, as per Dulat, was however shattered by his house arrest in wake of the abrogation. Dulat's latest account, published by Juggernaut, is replete with rhapsodies of praise for the NC veteran; the writer claims that Farooq and he, sent to Kashmir to head the IB office there, hit if off from the word go and would often set protocol aside to sit and discuss Kashmir affairs over drinks and dinner. IB reports to the Union home ministry.Another interesting revelation by Dulat relates to the abduction of then Union minister Mufti Mohammed Sayeed's daughter Rubaiya Sayeed in 1989. Dulat, who was then heading the IB office in Kashmir, said JKLF had initially planned to abduct Safia, eldest daughter of then chief minister Farooq Abdullah, but dropped the idea due to the high security around their Gupkar Road residence. In the meantime, Dulat wrote, V P Singh was sworn in as PM on Dec 2, 1989, and Mufti was made India's first home minister. This is when JKLF got a brainwave: ""Why not pick up Rubaiya?"". Mufti was then seen as Delhi's man, with no real connection to the Valley.Farooq initially opposed the Centre's decision to release militants in exchange for Rubaiya, but eventually acquiesced, having told Mufti earlier ""not to worry"".Farooq had also voiced reservations to the release of Mushtaq Zargar, a Kashmiri militant, as part of the IC-814 hostage swap deal, while being okay with freeing Masood Azhar and Omar Sheikh. However, then governor Gary Saxena convinced the chief minister - over a drink of ""Black Label"" - that it was the only option, given the circumstances.",Former RAW secretary and 'friend' A S Dulat's claim in his latest book that the senior Abdullah had privately supported the abrogation of Article 370 in J&K.

BHOPAL: A local court in Bhopal has ordered further investigation into the unsolved death of Mahila Congress activist Sarla Mishra in Feb 1997. How can anyone with 90% burns give - and sign - a dying declaration, was one of the key questions asked by the court.Police had filed a closure report in the case in 2000, suggesting it was suicide. Sarla's brother Anurag Mishra, however, wasn't convinced and moved court to reopen the investigation. The court accepted his plea Thursday, observing the investigation was incomplete.Sarla was found burnt at her home in Bhopal on Feb 14, 1997. She was transferred to Delhi's Safdarjung Hospital where she died five days later. It triggered a political storm in MP with fingers being raised at even then CM Digvijaya Singh for 'hushing up' the case.Around six months ago, Anurag filed a 'protest petition' in MP HC against closure of the case. HC asked a Bhopal court to record the statements of witnesses in the case, including the complainant, and examine whether closure of the case was in accordance with law. After recording statements and examining the case diary, judicial magistrate first-class Palak Rai concluded that the police probe was ""incomplete"" and asked police to further investigate the case and present a final report in court.","Sarla Mishra was found burnt at her home in Bhopal on Feb 14, 1997.
