NEW DELHI: Hitting out at Rahul Gandhi for his “hypocrisy” on the caste census issue, key NDA constituent Janata Dal (United) on Sunday accused the Congress member of maintaining silence when Bihar CM Nitish Kumar raised the matter in INDIA bloc meetings. The Kumar-led JD(U), which was part of the INDIA bloc before he snapped ties with the opposition alliance and joined hands with BJP, also asked why Congress govt in Karnataka has not released the state’s caste data.JD(U) working president and MP Sanjay Jha ’s attack on Gandhi came a day after he slammed the caste survey carried out by the Kumar-led govt as a fake exercise at an event in Patna, while pitching for a nationwide caste census.“There cannot be a bigger hypocrisy than this. I was a witness to Gandhi maintaining silence while Kumar strongly and logically spoke in favour of caste census at INDIA bloc meetings in several places,” Jha told reporters.Incidentally, Bihar’s caste survey was carried out and its findings were released when Congress was a partner in the govt led by Kumar. Jha said Kumar was the only leader who raised the issue of caste census, and all INDIA bloc members were a witness.Defending caste survey in Bihar , he said Kumar is the only leader since 1931, when a nationwide caste census was held last, who decided to count population of different castes in a scientific manner to further social justice .Taking a swipe at Gandhi, he said the leader of opposition in Lok Sabha should be more specific and tell people if he believes that Bihar’s caste survey has overcounted some communities and undercounted some others.Jha said Kumar has used the figures to expand the scope of reservations, though the issue is currently sub-judice. Slamming Congress, he said its govt in Karnataka has been sitting over the caste-wise population data in the state for several years.","JD(U) working president and MP Sanjay Jha ’s attack on Gandhi came a day after he slammed the caste survey carried out by the Kumar-led govt as a fake exercise.

Govt has said the water authority would supply water to the unit, while people are struggling for drinking water.”Congress MLA VD Satheesan called the minister the propaganda manager for the company. “The owners of this company are involved in the Delhi liquor policy case, and were charged by central and state pollution control boards for contaminating groundwater in Punjab. Why was permission granted to such a company?” he asked.Satheesan also questioned the transparency of the approval process: “Did any distillery operating in Kerala know about govt’s decision to change the liquor policy and allow alcohol production? No other company in the country, apart from this one operating in MP and Punjab, knew about the policy change.”Rajesh said the brewery had received preliminary approval following compliance with existing laws and regulations. “Facts will be presented before the public. No exploitation of water will be allowed. Approval was given after examining all these factors,” he said.

BHUBANESHWAR: Nearly two years since former Odisha health minister Naba Das’ assassination, BJP and BJD on Sunday were involved in a verbal spat over the murder investigation with a member of the governing party — BJP — alleging that a person who wanted to succeed Naveen Patnaik as Odisha CM played a key role in Naba’s murder, a charge denied by the opposition.Without naming the person, Bargarh BJP MP Pradeep Purohit said, “He is the main conspirator. The state crime branch investigation shielded the conspirator. Gopal Das (an Odisha police officer accused in the case), is just a pawn.”Senior BJP MLA Jayanarayan Mishra also saw BJD role in Naba’s murder along with the involvement of an IAS and an IPS officer. “An IAS and an IPS officer, along with two BJD politicians, plotted Naba’s murder. The IPS officer visited Jharsuguda a few days ahead of Naba’s murder. Coal business and political dealings led to the murder. A CBI investigation can unravel the mystery,” Mishra said.On Jan 29, 2023, Naba, who was then health minister in BJD govt, was gunned down by assistant sub-inspector Gopal Das in Odisha’s Jharsuguda district.Purohit also questioned the delayed demand for a CBI probe by Naba’s family, suggesting they remained quiet to safeguard its political and business interests.BJD rubbished allegations, defending the crime branch investigation. “The investigation into the cabinet minister’s killing was on the right track. The main and lone accused Gopal Das was arrested the same day. Chargesheet has already been filed and trial commenced. If the BJP govt wants, they are welcome to transfer the case to CBI,” senior BJD neta Bhupinder Singh said.","BJP MP Pradeep Purohit alleges that a person who wanted to succeed Naveen Patnaik as Odisha CM played a key role in Naba’s murder.

It also proposed reinstating the provision for a referendum to amend the constitution and introducing a bicameral parliament - a lower house (national assembly) and upper house (senate) - to ensure representation for all.Both houses will have terms of four years, meaning govt's and the PM's term will also be four years, the commission has suggested. It has recommended reforms to ensure that the PM can face a no-confidence motion in parliament.To prevent the concentration of power in the hands of an individual or institution, it has proposed the creation of a constitutional body - national constitutional council (NCC) - to establish a system of checks and balances between the three branches of the state and the two executive positions - PM and president.This council would include the president, chief justice, PM, leaders of opposition of both houses, speakers and deputy speakers from the opposition, and a representative of other parties. The commission has recommended decentralising the judiciary by maintaining the unitary structure of Supreme Court, while establishing permanent high court benches with jurisdiction in all divisional cities.It has also provided a framework for an interim govt to be formed after the dissolution of parliament, and recommended that selection of advisers to such govts should be solely the NCC's responsibility.",The Constitution Reform Commission has recommended introducing a two-term limit on the PM's tenure.

They had previously been sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment in the case, which SC termed ""malicious"".Following the verdict, there are now no legal barriers preventing the two-time former PM from contesting the upcoming national elections. Khaleda and her son are currently residing in London.SC overturned the judgments delivered during the regime of ousted PM Sheikh Hasina by the high court and trial court. The trial court had sentenced Khaleda to five years' imprisonment, while Tarique and the other accused received 10 years each. Later, HC doubled Khaleda's sentence to 10 years while upholding trial court's verdict for the other accused.In its ruling, SC observed that the prosecution of the Zia Orphanage Trust case was ""malicious"" and noted that the accused, who did not appeal the HC verdict, would also benefit from this judgment ""restoring their dignity as innocent individuals"".A five-member bench of the appellate division, led by Chief Justice Syed Refaat Ahmed, delivered the unanimous verdict. The ruling came after hearings on two appeals filed by Khaleda and individual appeals made by Kazi Kamal and businessman Sharafuddin Ahmed. Khaleda had initially been jailed on Feb 8, 2018 after a special court in Dhaka sentenced her to five years in prison for her involvement in the case. The other accused - Kazi Kamal, Sharafuddin, Kamal Uddin Siddique and Mominur Rahman - were sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment for misappropriating over BDT 2.1 crore, which was intended as foreign grants for orphans.","Khaleda Zia, her son and BNP acting chairman Tarique Rahman were acquitted on Wednesday by the appellate division of Bangladesh Supreme Court.
