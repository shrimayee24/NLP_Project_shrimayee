a front-on attack on Modi-Shah

NEW DELHI: The much-awaited showdown between Narendra Modi and Rahul Gandhi unfolded in dramatic fashion in Lok Sabha on Monday with the newly-appointed leader of opposition saying, ""those who call themselves Hindus indulge in hatred, violence and untruths 24x7"", drawing a strong rebuttal from the PM.Rahul's remarks, during the debate on the motion of thanks on the President's address, inflamed what was already building up as an intense duel.Modi immediately got up to protest, saying, ""Calling the entire Hindu community violent is a serious issue.""Rahul shot back, ""Modiji, BJP , RSS are not the entire Hindu community... A Hindu can never spread violence or fear or hatred."" As treasury benches protested, he said, ""Aap Hindu ho hi nahi"".The exchange was one of many which marked Rahul's maiden speech as leader of opposition. While he appeared charged, targeting govt over Manipur, Agniveer, NEET and MSP, an indication of BJP's combative intent came right at the outset in the form of the PM's riposte to Rahul's jibe about his face betraying no expression. ""I have been taught by the Constitution and democracy to take the LoP seriously,"" Modi said.The PM got support from his senior colleagues. Home minister Amit Shah supported Modi's charge that Rahul had insulted Hindus. ""Crores of people in country proudly call themselves Hindus. Are they all speaking about violence? Linking violence to any religion, that too by somebody holding a constitutional position... I believe he should apologise,"" Shah said. With the treasury benches up in arms, Rahul retorted, ""Aap Hindu ho hi nahin.""Rahul said when opposition was ""violently crushed"", with two CMs put in jail, they sought refuge in ""Shiv ji"", as he flashed a poster of the deity. The Speaker and BJP members objected to it. He said the snake around Shiva's neck, trident behind his left shoulder and ""abhay mudra"" taught fearlessness, non-violence and courage.He said BJP brass spent 10 years spreading ""hate, fear and violence"" against anyone who opposed their policies, calling such actions contrary to the teachings of Lord Shiva and precepts of other religions. He said the two BJP tenures witnessed relentless assault on the foundational ideas of India and the Constitution, with farmers, students, small businessmen, opposition and soldiers bearing the brunt of whimsical policies and ""vendetta"". He also repeatedly mocked PM as ""non-biological"" who has ""direct connection with the almighty"", ribbing Modi on his campaign-time claims.Rahul also referred to Ayodhya, saying BJP MP Anurag Thakur had spoken on the topic. ""Anurag had talked about the attack on Sanatan Dharma, that's why I have done this. I want to show what happened in Ayodhya, what was the truth of Ayodhya..."" Gandhi said people of Ayodhya have given a message by defeating BJP.Rahul's speech on the motion of thanks to the President's joint address, his first as the leader of opposition in Lok Sabha, was a biting, front-on attack on Modi and Shah, who along with defence minister Rajnath Singh occupied the front row for the address.Rahul also congratulated BJP on winning 240 seats and promised support. ""Opposition is not your enemy. We are here to make your job easier,"" he said. However, he also urged them to ""not spread fear and hatred"".","Rahul's remarks inflamed what was already building up as an intense duel.

BJP's all-out counter attack

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday took repeated digs at Prime Minister Modi and unleashed an all-out attack on the BJP as his first speech as leader of opposition in Lok Sabha gave a glimpse of the new power equation in the Lower House after Lok Sabha elections 2024 which has changed the number dynamics.Rahul's remark ""Those who call themselves Hindu only talk about violence, hatred and untruth ..."" targeted at the BJP triggered a massive uproar in Lok Sabha from the treasury benches and saw a rare faceoff between the Prime Minister and the leader of the opposition.From the Agniveer scheme to the NEET row, Rahul fired several salvos at the government amid strong rebuttals from several Union ministers. The Congress leader did not spare Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla as well, citing his differential treatment to leader of opposition and PM Modi after they together escorted the Speaker to his chair.Rahul made several references to Lord Shiva, whose picture he showed to the House despite several requests by the Speaker, to drive home what appeared to be the central theme of his speech 'Don't be scared and don't scare others (daro mat, darao mat)'.Holding up pictures of Lord Shiva, Guru Nanak and Jesus Christ, he referred to Hinduism, Islam, Sikhism, Christianity, Buddhism and Jainism to underline the importance of fearlessness.When the treasury-bench members protested, Rahul slammed the BJP, saying, ""Aap Hindu ho hi nahi (You are not Hindus). It is clearly written in Hinduism that one should stand with the truth and not back down from the truth or be scared of it."" When PM Modi intervened, Rahul shot back and said BJP, RSS or Modi do not represent the entire Hindus.Later when Rahul alleged that ministers do not greet him due to the fear of Modi, the Prime Minister intervened once again and said democracy and the Constitution have taught him to take the leader of opposition seriously.The impact of changed numbers in Lok Sabha was clearly visible as a united opposition was ready to match the lung power of the treasury benches all through Rahul's speech.Rahul Gandhi was unsparing in his attack on Prime Minister Modi. Citing one of Prime Minister's remarks made during campaigning, Rahul said ""Parmatma speaks directly to Modiji's atma.""He then went on to take a dig at another remark on how a movie had revived Mahatma Gandhi. Rahul said Prime Minister Narendra Modi stated that Mahatma Gandhi was revived by a movie but the Father of the Nation was always alive.Rahul alleged that the BJP was spreading fear among every section of society.""You scare the minorities ... you spread violence, hatred against minorities, against Muslims, against Sikhs, against Christians. And what have the minorities done? They represent India in every sphere, they make India proud,"" the leader of opposition said.""They stand steadfast with India like mountains, they are patriots and you attacked all the minorities, spread violence and hatred against them,"" he added.Rahul then went on to attack the government on issues like Manipur violence, the Agniveer scheme which he called the brainchild of PMO and not the Army. He called Agniveers “use and throw labourers,” evoking strong objection from defence minister Rajnath Singh. Rahul attacked government over medical entrance test NEET and said it is not a professional exam but a ""commercial"" one that has been designed for the rich and not for meritorious people. On Manipur, he again targeted PM Modi and said for the government it seems Manipur is not part of India.Rahul's aggressive speech evoked very strong reactions from several leaders and ministers of the BJP. They not just slammed Rahul but also sought an apology from the leader of opposition for making baseless allegations and ""peddling lies.""The RSS hit out at Rahul for his ""not Hindus"" jibe at the ruling BJP and said it was ""unfortunate"" that the leader of opposition linked Hindutva with violence.Reacting to the Congress leader's remarks, senior Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) functionary Sunil Ambedkar said, ""People occupying important positions linking Hindutva with violence is unfortunate.""""Whether it is the Hindutva of (Swami) Vivekananda or (Mahatma) Gandhi, it is a symbol of harmony and brotherhood,"" he added.Many Hindu saints also condemned Rahul Gandhi's ""not Hindus"" jibe at the BJP and demanded an apology from him.(With inputs from agencies)","Rahul's remark ""Those who call themselves Hindu only talk about violence, hatred and untruth..."" triggered a massive uproar in Lok Sabha from the treasury benches.

I am calling him a martyr, but govt doesn't acknowledge him as a martyr. The family won't receive a pension or compensation, nor will their son be recognised as a martyr.""Rajnath Singh reacted promptly, saying that the Congress leader was speaking a blatant lie.Rahul also claimed that the Agnipath scheme was imposed on the Army by the PMO and it didn't have enough acceptance in the armed forces.The defence minister, in a strong rebuttal to LoP's charges, informed the House that govt held direct consultations with at least 158 organisations before rolling out the project and added that their views and suggestions were factored in.""LoP must understand the scheme first,"" Singh said and demanded that Rahul's references to Agniveers be expunged from the House proceedings.Later, Shah urged Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla that the statements made by Rahul and the defence minister should be scrutinised and the country must be told the truth. ""This House is not for spreading lies. Rahul should apologise to the House, to the country and to Agniveers,"" he said.The former Congress chief also slammed govt over farmers' issues, saying it did not want to give a legal guarantee to the minimum support price (MSP) for crops.

"Acerbic Rahul spares none, attacks even LS Speaker Birla",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/acerbic-rahul-spares-none-attacks-even-ls-speaker-birla/articleshow/111413268.cms,"NEW DELHI: In his first speech as the leader of opposition, Rahul Gandhi spared none in Lok Sabha , with targets of his combative charge being PM Narendra Modi , Amit Shah , Rajnath Singh, and even Speaker Om Birla.Urging ""fairness"" in the House, Rahul recalled he along with Modi had walked Birla to the Chair on his election as Speaker last week. Addressing Birla, he said ""you"" were straight when you shook hands with ""me"", but you bowed when you shook PM's hand.A shocked Shah alleged Rahul was levelling allegations against the Chair. When Birla clarified it was ""his culture"" to bow to elders (Modi) and be equal with contemporaries, Rahul shot back that ""nobody is above Speaker"" and all should bow to the Speaker. ""We are subservient to the Speaker. Some may feel they are not,"" he said.Rahul was particularly acerbic on Modi, whom he repeatedly teased as ""non biological"" - we all are born and we die, but ""parmatma"" speaks to ""atma"" of Modi. He laughed that Modi had claimed that Mahatma Gandhi was dead and was revived by a movie. It was a reference to Modi's claim in an interview that he was ""non biological"" and messenger of the divine. He mocked that demonetisation and order to give Mumbai airport to Adani were also God's messages.Rahul said SP's Faizabad MP Awadhesh Prasad told him that Modi commissioned three surveys with the idea of contesting from ""Ayodhya"", but his surveyors told him that he would lose. He then went to Varanasi, and barely escaped defeat.To demonstrate his point about ""abhay mudra"" and religions preaching fearlessness, Rahul showed pictures of Lord Shiva, an Islamic motif, Jesus Christ, Guru Nanak, Mahatma Buddha and Mahaveer. When he picked Shiva's photo again, he pointed to the giant screens in the House and complained that the camera was not on him, an echo of an old complaint. The cameras returned to him, but when he picked the photo again, the focus went back to the Chair. It led to laughter in the House.Poking fun, Rahul said Modi not only spreads fear outside but has also intimidated the BJP functionaries, pointing out that Rajnath who had earlier greeted him with a smile was now sitting seriously in the PM's presence. Then, Rahul lectured BJP on ""internal democracy"", stating that opposition parties have it, even mentioning Congress' ginger group - ""G-22, G-23"".When Shah made a stray quip to his account of a Gujarat trip, Rahul said, ""I keep going to Gujarat, and this time we will defeat you there. Take it in writing, INDIA will defeat you.""Once, Shah objected to Rahul alleging that BJP had called farmers ""terrorists"". But Rahul pointed to Akali Dal MP Harsimrat Badal, and said ""your ally is nodding, she also agrees with us.""","Rahul was particularly acerbic on Modi, whom he repeatedly teased as ""non biological"" He laughed that Modi had claimed that Mahatma Gandhi was dead and was revived by a movie.

BJP is not the entire Hindu society, RSS is not the entire society, this is not BJP's contract,"" he said.""Abhayamudra is the symbol of Congress...The Abhayamudra is the gesture of fearlessness, is the gesture of reassurance and safety, which dispels fear and accords divine protection and bliss in Hinduism, Islam, Sikhism, Buddhism and other Indian religions....All our great men have spoken about non-violence and finishing fear...But, those who call themselves Hindu only talk about violence, hatred, untruth...Aap Hindu ho hi nahi,"" the Congress leader added.In reaction to Rahul Gandhi's remark, Union Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said that the latter has taken up a position of Leader of Opposition for the first time and has made very irresponsible statements thus bringing the level of politics down.He said that Rahul Gandhi has degraded the position of the Leader of Opposition, which was once handled by prominent leaders.""The position of the Leader of the Opposition (LoP) is a highly responsible one. Leaders like Atal Ji, Advani Ji, and Sushma Ji have handled this responsibility with great care. Today, Rahul Gandhi has taken up a position for the first time and has made very irresponsible statements. Rahul said that no compensation is given to the martyrs under the Agniveer scheme. This is the biggest lie. Today, the Defence Minister clearly stated in Parliament that martyrs under the Agniveer scheme receive a compensation of Rs 1 crore. Rahul Ji should check his facts before making such statements. Congress has always raised such questions about the army and tried to mislead the country,"" Vaishnaw said.""Rahul Gandhi insulted the constitutional position of the Speaker. This is not the first time; remember when Rahul Gandhi tore up his own government's ordinance. During the UPA government, the constitutional position of the Prime Minister was undermined by the unconstitutional body called the National Advisory Council (NAC), which was run by Sonia Gandhi,"" he added.Further, the BJP leader added that the Congress has always aimed to weaken constitutional structures.","Rahul Gandhi said in the lower house today that the BJP is not the entire Hindu society.
