"‘Daro mat,’ Modi taunts Rahul as he picks Rae Bareli",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/daro-mat-modi-taunts-rahul-as-he-picks-rae-bareli/articleshow/109826271.cms,"NEW DELHI: For the past few days, Rahul Gandhi would consistently claim that PM Narendra Modi was running scared and was on the verge of breaking down. On Friday, it was the PM’s turn to tell the Congress leader that the taunt was on him. With Rahul choosing to vacate Amethi for the ""safer Rai Bareli"", Modi led BJP leaders in mocking him, spraying him with ""daro mat (don't be afraid), bhaago mat (don't run away) barbs that Rahul had hurled against him.“Today, I want to tell him (Rahul), daro mat, bhaago mat,” Modi said at a rally in Bardhaman in Bengal soon after Rahul gave in to relentless persuasion from his colleagues to contest from Rai Bareli.Modi quickly projected Rahul’s decision to vacate Amethi, which he had lost to Smriti Irani in 2019, as a pointer to BJP’s third consecutive landslide, while also saying that the decision to contest from Rai Bareli showed the Congress leader's jitters about his prospects in Wayanad in Kerala. “Many media personalities and experts continue to speculate about the election outcome. There is no longer any need for opinion polls or exit polls, the country's voice is clear. The only question that still remains unsettled is whether we are going to cross the 400 mark,"" he added.Modi asserted that Congress’s tally in the Lok Sabha polls would be an “all-time low”, and the party would struggle to cross even the “half century” mark. Congress’s lowest tally was in 2014 when it bagged 44 seats. In 2019, it managed 52.Taking a swipe at Sonia Gandhi for moving to the Rajya Sabha, the PM said he had mentioned earlier that the most prominent opposition leader would be too afraid to contest and she fled in fear. “She ran off to Rajasthan and entered Rajya Sabha from there,” he said. “I had already predicted that Congress's ‘shehzada’ would lose in Wayanad and, fearing defeat, he would immediately start looking for another seat once voting in Wayanad concluded,” he added.Continuing BJP’s onslaught, home minister Amit Shah said at a rally in Chikkodi in Karnataka that Sonia’s bids to “launch” Rahul had failed in the past and would happen again. “Sonia Gandhi tried to launch Rahul 20 times but failed every time. This time around, he is going to be launched for the 21st time. He is contesting from Rae Bareli instead of Amethi out of fear of loss. I am going to predict the mandate here. Rahul Gandhi is going to face a crushing defeat in Rae Bareli,” he said.BJP also took a dig at Congress for not fielding Priyanka Gandhi from Amethi. “It is clear as daylight that Rahul Gandhi’s camp doesn’t want his sister to rise, lest she outshine him. How this sibling struggle for power within Congress plays out remains to be seen. But for now, Priyanka has lost out again,” BJP IT department chief Amit Malviya said.","Rahul Gandhi claimed that PM Narendra Modi was running scared and was on the verge of breaking down.

He has been recognised as a pivotal political figure contributing to the BJP's success in the District Panchayat elections.He has also been elected as a member of the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Council thrice in 2010, 2016, and 2022.Reports suggest that Dinesh has been actively engaging with various segments of the electorate within the constituency for several days, garnering support from local BJP organisational units.With Dinesh Singh's nomination alongside Karan Bhushan Sharan Singh, BJP has now fielded a total of 13 Rajput candidates.

Lok Sabha elections: Why Rahul Gandhi opted for Rae Bareli and not Amethi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lok-sabha-elections-why-rahul-gandhi-opted-for-rae-bareli-and-not-amethi/articleshow/109824406.cms,"'No prestige battle'

'Safe seat for Congress'

Alliance with Samajwadi Party

NEW DELHI: The suspense around Congress’s picks for Amethi and Rae Bareli Lok Sabha seats finally ended on Friday. And yes, one of the Gandhis is in the fray in politically crucial state of Uttar Pradesh, as a senior party leader A K Antony had stated almost a month back. But there are some twists to the tale. As was widely expected, Rahul Gandhi has decided not to return to Amethi and Priyanka Gandhi will not be making her poll debut from Rae Bareli.Instead, the Congress has fielded Rahul from Rae Bareli, a seat vacated by his mother Sonia Gandhi , who opted out of electoral politics and is now a member of Rajya Sabha from Rajasthan. There was anticipation that a member of the Gandhi family would be fielded to take forward Sonia’s legacy in Rae Bareli, which she represented for 20 long years.So, why did Rahul opt for Rae Bareli and not Amethi?Rahul Gandhi is already in the middle of tackling perhaps what can be called his toughest political challenge. After leading the grand old party to two humiliating successive Lok Sabha defeats, the former Congress chief faces a daunting task of ensuring that the party rebounds in these elections and increases its seat tally to a respectable level. In 2014, the Congress won 44 Lok Sabha seats – the lowest ever by the party and in 2019 the party could manage only 52 seats.Amethi, which for long was a Gandhi bastion, is no more a cakewalk for the Congress. In 2019, Smriti Irani defeated Rahul Gandhi to bring to an end his 15-year stint in the constituency. The BJP has fielded Smriti again, and in her, Rahul and the Congress would have had a tough challenger. If Rahul had decided to contest from Amethi, it would have turned into a ""prestige battle"" and the Congress leader would have had to focus all his energy and resources on the seat. A second successive defeat in Amethi would have meant a great loss of face for the leader and the party.Rae Bareli has been represented by Sonia Gandhi for 20 long years. It was the only seat that the Congress had won in Uttar Pradesh in 2019 Lok Sabha elections . In fact, after Independence, barring three occasions, the Congress has been continuously winning the seat. Rahul would hope that the voters of Rae Bareli continue with their support for the party. He has already called Rae Bareli the ""karmabhoomi of the family"" and has sought the love and blessings of voters.Uttar Pradesh is one of the few states where the Congress could manage a tie-up well in advance and without much of trouble. The party is contesting 17 Lok Sabha seats in the state in alliance with Samajwadi Party. Rahul Gandhi and the Congress would hope that tie-up with Akhilesh Yadav helps the grand old party in this important seat. Of the five assembly seats that come under Rae Bareli, four -- Bachhrawan (SC), Harchandpur, Sareni and Unchahar -- are held by the Samajwadi Party.It remains to be seen if Rahul Gandhi's strategy of opting for Rae Bareli proves to be successful. For now, he is under intense opposition fire for dumping Amethi for Rae Bareli.","The suspense around Congress’s picks for Amethi and Rae Bareli Lok Sabha seats finally ended on Friday.

Congress wanted

Rahul Gandhi

and

Priyanka Gandhi

to contest. Why did Rahul eventually decide to contest from Rae Bareli and Priyanka stayed away from the contest?

Since you say that she is a superstar campaigner, would it not have been better if she contested the polls?

Don’t you think holding up the announcement of candidates till the last day of nomination sends out a message that there was reluctance or indecisiveness on the part of Rahul and Priyanka?

Congress has been under attack from BJP on issues ranging from redistribution of wealth, inheritance tax, religion-based quota and Muslim appeasement. What do you have to say?

May consider interim bail for Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/may-consider-interim-bail-for-delhi-cm-arvind-kejriwal-supreme-court/articleshow/109826049.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday said it may consider if interim bail could be granted to Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal or not in view of polling in the capital in three weeks, as deciding on the AAP chief ’s plea challenging his arrest in the excise policy case may take time given that it involved larger issues related to action under Prevention of Money Laundering Act .At the end of the day's proceedings, which remained inconclusive, a bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Datta indicated that it may have to consider interim bail for Kejriwal but made it clear to both Enforcement Directorate and the CM that it was not expressing a view one way or another. “We are going to hear you both. We must be open to you, because neither side should be taken by surprise. Do not assume anything, do not read anything into it,” the bench said and asked both sides to come prepared on May 7.It asked additional solicitor general S V Raju to seek instructions from ED regarding the conditions which should be imposed if interim bail is granted. “This case may take time… we may consider the question of interim bail, because of the elections,” the bench told the ASG. The court is left with only two weeks before going into summer recess. Opposing the proposition of interim bail, Raju told the bench that AAP MP Sanjay Singh, who was earlier granted bail in the excise case, was making all sorts of statements after coming out of jail.The court said it would hear the ASG before grant of any relief and asked senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi whether Kejriwal would be signing any files as he’s Delhi CM.Voting for the seven Lok Sabha seats in Delhi is scheduled for May 25, while polling in Punjab is in the last phase on June 1. Kejriwal, who was arrested on March 21, has questioned the timing of his arrest and accused the Centre and ED of trying to disturb AAP’s campaign. Kejriwal's petition raised a larger issue on interpretation of Section 19 of PMLA, which says if an ED officer, on the basis of material in his possession, has reason to believe (that reason for such belief to be recorded in writing) that any person was guilty of money laundering, then he may arrest such person and inform him of the grounds for such arrest.The bench said it has to be examined how far the court can go to examine whether the objective materials are sufficient enough to trigger arrest and the subjective decision of the officer. The court said there was a higher-than-normal threshold of arrest under PMLA.",The Supreme Court on Friday said it may consider if interim bail could be granted to Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal.

Jingle vs jungle jibe: Tejashwi Yadav’s musical counter to PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jingle-vs-jungle-jibe-tejashwis-musical-counter-to-modi/articleshow/109825922.cms,"PATNA: During the 2019 poll campaign, Congress MP Rahul Gandhi had gone to voters with the “Chowkidar **** ***” slogan, which ultimately proved counterproductive for the opposition alliance. This time round, his ally and RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav has been taking on Prime Minister Narendra Modi with a 1990s’ Bollywood number, “Tum to dhokebaaz ho, wada karke bhool jaate ho.”And, he appears to be striking a chord with voters.Dressed in his trademark white kurta-pyjama with a big RJD election symbol (lantern) embossed on it, Tejashwi has been singing this popular number from the GovindaKarisma starrer, ‘Saajan Chale Sasural’, at almost every election rally. Not only this, he has been playing audio clips of the PM’s past speeches promising to “grant special attention to Bihar, giving two crore jobs to youths every year, bringing back black money allegedly stashed in foreign banks and taming surging inflation” to drive home his point.Unlike Rahul’s ‘chowkidar’ jibe, Tejashwi has been successful in attacking Modi without getting too personal. Such has been its impact that people are attending his rallies in large numbers, braving the scorching sun. At the moment, Tejashwi, 35, seems to be waging a lone electoral battle against the army of mighty NDA leaders like PM Modi, Amit Shah, Rajnath Singh, J P Nadda, Yogi Adityanath and Bihar CM Nitish Kumar , who went to the NDA fold after breaking with the Grand Alliance barely three months ago.Only two top Congress leaders — Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi — have come here since the elections started, leaving the responsibility of opposition poll campaign solely on the shoulders of Tejashwi. Although RJD president Lalu Prasad figures among the list of the party’s 40 star campaigners, he was seen sharing stage only with his daughter, Rohini Acharya, who is making a poll debut from Saran Lok Sabha seat this time. In fact, Lalu’s multiple health complications do not permit him to walk freely and address rallies in this hot and humid weather, with the temperature rising to 45 degrees Celsius.On the other hand, Nitish has been unsparing in his attacks on Lalu, questioning his move to bear so many children, promoting his family in politics and indulging in corruption. However, Tejashwi has preferred not to hit back. “Nitish ji mere liye adarniya hain, abhibhawak hain. Wo kuchh bhi kah sakte hain. Wo jo bhi kahenge, mere liye ashirwad hoga (Nitish is like a guardian. I consider his words a blessing),” is all that Tejashwi says when asked about Nitish’s comments about his family. Apparently, Tejashwi’s focus on granting government jobs during his 17-month tenure in the second Nitish-led Grand Alliance govt, where he was deputy CM, has made him the darling of young voters.However, Nitish says the jobs were given because of him. Such is Tejashwi’s popularity that every Grand Alliance candidate wants him to campaign for them. According to RJD spokesperson Shakti Singh Yadav, Tejashwi has so far addressed 92 election rallies in the state. At his rallies, Tejashwi has been focusing on three key issues giving jobs to youths, taming inflation and putting a check on migration. Although there is no official data available about people working outside the state, Bihar govt had transferred Rs 1,000 each to the bank accounts of around 35 lakh migrant labourers during the nationwide lockdown due to Covid in April 2020. The figure amply explains the pangs of migration.Analysts say Tejashwi became the party’s star campaigner due to certain political compulsions. First, he had to lead the poll campaigns single-handedly in 2019 as his father was in jail after his conviction in the multi-crore fodder scam cases. Tejashwi shone during the 2020 Bihar assembly elections when he launched intensive poll campaigns and took on the mighty Nitish and his NDA colleagues then, addressing as many as 16-19 election rallies in a single day.The end result was startling as RJD emerged as the single-largest party in the 243-member Bihar assembly, while Nitish’s JD(U) was relegated to a distant third, marking the beginning of JD(U)’s downfall that still continues. Tejashwi was first seen sharing stage with party leaders during the 2009 LS polls when Lalu was facing the toughest battle of his political career from Saran LS seat and his wife Rabri Devi, former Bihar CM, joined the poll campaign in his support.Saran was earlier known as Chhapra before delimitation in 2009. It was then that Tejashwi started following his mother at election rallies. At that time, Tejashwi was often spotted following his mother on the stage and standing silently behind her.He graduated into politics after the party fielded him from Raghopur in the 2015 assembly elections. He won and became deputy CM in the first Nitish-led Grand Alliance govt formed in the state in Nov 2015. But the govt fell barely 20 months later as Nitish went back to NDA camp. The setback sharpened Tejashwi, and the change was palpable in his speech during the trust motion. The rest is history","Tejashwi Prasad Yadav has been taking on Prime Minister Narendra Modi with a 1990s’ Bollywood number, ‘Tum to dhokebaaz ho, wada karke bhool jaate ho’ He appears to be striking a chord with voters and people are attending his rallies in large numbers.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109825916,imgsize-1452677,width-400,resizemode-4/109825916.jpg"
"Congress's DK Shivakumar let fellow Vokkaliga Prajwal flee, says Amit Shah",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congresss-dk-shivakumar-let-fellow-vokkaliga-prajwal-flee-says-amit-shah/articleshow/109825833.cms,"NDA

will cross 400 by 1pm on June 4, Amit Shah says

NEW DELHI: Seeking to turn the tables on the opposition alliance over the Prajwal Revanna case, Union home minister Amit Shah on Friday accused Karnataka deputy chief minister D K Shivakumar of allowing the JD(S) MP to leave the country as he reckoned that taking immediate action could cost Congress .“We have taken a clear stand. We must take the strictest steps and if Karnataka govt cannot, then let it be.We will take action. Until the vokkaliga voting was done, they suppressed the whole thing. And as soon as voting was over, they brought it out, and by then he had fled. I am telling you, if they had taken steps in time, he wouldn’t have been able to flee and would have been arrested,” Shah said.He pointed out that Shivakumar, the deputy CM, was a vokkaliga like Revanna. “The agency actually belongs to whom, in Karnataka it’s with Congress. They were supposed to investigate and would have known. I am clearly accusing. They suppressed it until the Vokkaliga voting was over,” he added.In an interview with Times Now Navbharat, Amit Shah justified the police investigation against those accused of circulating a video which was doctored to make it appear that he had called for scrapping Dalit quota, saying those who edit and distort videos to influence elections must be ready to face the consequences. “Police will investigate, and everyone should cooperate with the investigation. And then they will say no, no, no, the agencies have come upon us, and they start crying, so brother why did you edit? You cooperate now,” he said.Shah mocked the opposition for its allegations about EVMs being faulty, and said the voting machines were highly secure and could not be tampered with by any external force.“If they lose, they blame EVMs and if they win, they accept it wholeheartedly. Don’t take the oath after winning. After all, it is the same EVM? The faulty EVM . Should they be taking oath after winning with faulty EVMs? Rahul Gandhi should say whether he will take oath as the winner from Wayanad?” he added.To a question about BJP “playing politics” on alleged sexual oppression of women in Sandeshkhali in Bengal by TMC functionaries, Shah emphasised HC had ordered a CBI probe into the incident. “Is HC playing politics?” he asked, adding that it was the “height of appeasement” that the culprit accused of exploiting hundreds of women right under the nose of a woman CM was not arrested until the court order.He also justified former Calcutta HC judge Abhijit Gangopadhyay contesting the poll as a BJP candidate. He said hundreds of people, ministers in Indira Gandhi’s ministry had done this. “Any judicial officer, after leaving their job, can join any party. This is not the first time this has happened. But if we do it, the question only arises then,” he said.Asked about NDA’s ambitious aim of winning 400 seats, Shah said the alliance would definitely win 400 seats. “By 1pm on 4th June, the people will bless Narendra Modi for the third time as PM with a majority of over 400 seats,” he added.On the opposition’s allegations of foul play after BJP candidates got elected unopposed, he said so far 37 people had been elected unopposed, most of them from Congress. “What about when Yashwantrao Chavan won, when Farooq Abdullah won, when Dimple Yadav (SP boss Akhilesh Yadav’s wife), was elected unopposed. They cannot handle even people in their own parties and describe every defeat as an attack on democracy,” he said.About the party’s explorations in the south, Shah said BJP would be a bigger party than Congress. “In Tamil Nadu, BJP will open its account. We will also be elected in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka,” he said.","Amit Shah accuses Karnataka deputy chief minister D K Shivakumar of allowing the JD(S) MP to leave the country. “We have taken a clear stand.

A tale of ‘nowhere people’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/a-tale-of-nowhere-people/articleshow/109825188.cms,"Out of sight is out of mind. That’s precisely the tragic story of a Purvanchal

village

lost in its odd

location

between two districts.

Healthcare is scarce too

There is no piped water here

The oddity of its location makes Siura Gopalpur locus classicus – a classic place. It’s barely five kilometres from the Mau district border and 20 from Mau town. But the village of 1,600 voters presses the button for the Salempur Lok Sabha constituency, which is 50 km away in Deoria district.The fast-flowing Ghaghara, the second largest tributary of the Ganga, has long kept the electors from the elected. Few here remember which MP or MLA visited them the last. To exacerbate matters, the village doesn’t officially belong to either Mau or Deoria district – it is part of the Ballia district.The connection to three districts – through proximity, Lok Sabha and district administration – has been a bane. Village head Manoj Kumar said, “This is our dilemma. We are the ‘nowhere people ’.” Life for the residents of nearly 300 houses is challenging.The village has power cables, but no power. “Connections were provided on paper to people under Saubhagya Ujjwala on the basis of their Aadhaar cards in 2018. But many had no idea such a thing had been done. Mayhem followed when people later received power bills up to Rs 40,000. Villagers have stayed away from using power since then. And most people can’t even afford it,” said Kumar.Batteries are used to charge a few mobile phones people have here.The village has a road that was laid in 2007 under Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana and has since vanished. In the rainy season, villagers are cut off from the rest of the civilization for days in the absence of a metalled road.There is a primary health centre, five km away in Kasaundar, but no doctor. “A compounder administers medical advice at the PHC when any patient is brought in. In case of serious illness, patients need to be taken to the district govt hospital, which is in Ballia town. There is no good private hospital either in a radius of 30-40 km,” said Rohan Singh who lost his father a decade ago to complications arising out of typhoid and hepatitis that went undetected for days.There is no employment here and agriculture is mostly unreliable.Many years ago, a villager had gone to work in a factory in Chennai. Many have followed him since. A few other youngsters have also gone to the Middle East as skilled labourers.“For ages, we have not seen any MP or MLA visiting our village, not even for election campaigns. We don’t exist, we don’t matter,” said Bahadur Singh (71), grandfather of six. His two sons, Ram Milan and Raju, are semi-skilled labourers working in Saudi Arabia for a couple of years now. His third son is waiting for his elder brothers to arrange for a visa and help him land a job there.Vishal Chauhan (28), who is preparing to become a teacher, said, “The groundwater in the village has heavy metals, like iron, and arsenic. But villagers do not have a choice. We stop using water from hand pumps that give out coloured water and instead use water that appears relatively cleaner. Nobody from the district administration has ever come to the village to inspect which hand pumps are providing drinkable water.”Ironically, the former Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar’s village Ibrahimpatti is just 18 km from Siura Gopalpur, and his son Neeraj Shekhar is Rajya Sabha member from BJP. Before that, he twice made it into Lok Sabha from Ballia constituency on the Samajwadi Party ticket after Chandra Shekhar’s death in 2007. He is now the BJP candidate from Ballia constituency this time. But that’s irrelevant in Siura Gopalpur – pretty much like the village itself that plunges into darkness soon after dawn. Nights here are longer.","Siura Gopalpur is barely five kilometres from the Mau district border and 20 from Mau town.

KL Sharma , a trusted aide of Sonia Gandhi, the former Congress president, served as her representative during her tenure as the member of Parliament from Rae Bareli.

Kishori Lal, a dedicated member of the Congress party, has been diligently overseeing the party's activities and operations in Amethi and Rae Bareli for a long time period. Kishori Lal has played a crucial role in maintaining the party's presence and influence in both the constituencies.

Kishori Lal Sharma, a native of Ludhiana, Punjab, was first introduced to Amethi by Rajiv Gandhi in approximately 1983.

Following Rajiv Gandhi's tragic demise in 1991, the Gandhi family stopped participating in elections from this constituency. However, Sharma remained steadfast in his support and continued to actively campaign for Congress party candidates in the area.

Nothing to chance |

Anti-incumbency |

Rebellion, dissidence |

An obligatory seat in Parliament. This is something women have been demanding for decades, but despite enacting legislation, reservation for women is still a long way off. But Davanagere Lok Sabha constituency is certain to send a woman to the Lok Sabha this time as both major parties have nominated a woman candidate.Skeptics might frown and say the two women were propped up by their respective families which have been engaged in a three-decades long battle for electoral supremacy in the district.Optimists might say the all-woman battle could be the harbinger of change, a trend not entirely unfamiliar in Davanagere.Once called the Manchester of Karnataka, a moniker attributed to its thriving cotton mills, Davanagere is now an educational and real estate hub. The change has reflected in its politics too with communist functionaries from humble backgrounds paving the way for rich businessmenturned-politicians like Shamanur Shivashankarappa and GM Siddeshwara.Although the Shivashankarappas and Siddeshwaras are related, the families have been bitter political rivals for generations. Both families are now engaged in another faceoff in the May 7 Lok Sabha elections . Shivashankarappa’s daughter-in-law and minister SS Mallikarjun’s wife Prabha is contesting on a Congress ticket. She faces Siddeshwara’s wife Gayathri of BJP.The Shivashankarappa family has seen much success in assembly elections with Shamanur and Mallikarjun pretty much sewing up Davanagere South and North seats.But in Lok Sabha elections, it is always Siddeshwara’s family that has had the upper hand. They have won six of the past seven elections (two by G Mallikarjunappa, Siddeshwara’s father and four by Siddeshwara) — four against Shamanur’s family members. The only time the Shamanur family defeated Mallikarjunappa was in 1998, that too by a slender margin.“We don’t know why BJP has become the favourite of the people of Davanagere but it has always been the first choice in Lok Sabha elections. Probably it is due to a shift in loyalties of Lingayats towards BJP because of former chief minister BS Yediyurappa,” said Nagaraj, a businessman pointing to the concentration of Lingayat community members in the constituency.This time, the Shamanur family is leaving no stone unturned to break the chain. It is hoping to cash in on the popularity of Mallikarjun and Prabha, a dentist, known for her social work and affable nature. They are also relying big time on the state govt’s five guarantees.But some say Prabha’s candidature has created a rift in the Shamanur family as other members are said to be upset with political opportunities being given only to Mallikarjun and Prabha.Be that as it may, Congress is riding high on the party’s success in last year’s assembly polls. It won five of eight assembly seats that fall under Davanagere Lok Sabha seat .On the other hand, Siddeshwara, who fielded his wife Gayathri after being instructed by the party high command not to contest due to anti-incumbency, is also going all out to ensure his family’s winning streak.Siddeshwara, who represented the seat four times on the trot, is banking on Lingayats’ loyalty to BJP and PM Modi’s popularity among the youth and the middle-class.But rebellion and dissidence haunt both parties. The problem appears more acute in Congress. This is largely due to the presence of GB Vinayakumar, who runs ‘Insight’, an extremely successful coaching centre for IAS aspirants and other competitive exams in Bengaluru, in the fray. Vinayakumar had brushed aside appeals from CM Siddaramaiah and his deputy DK Shivakumar to withdraw.Vinayakumar is a Kuruba, a community that commands about two lakh votes. He has been aggressively campaigning in the constituency, unexpectedly drawing huge crowds, especially youngsters. It has Congress worried.“He is attracting more crowds than Congress and BJP in rural areas,” said Ninganna, a Congress worker. “The fate of our candidate depends on how many votes Vinayakumar gets.”Siddeshwara and BJP also have troubles with many former MLAs and ex-ministers including MP Renukacharya and SA Ravindrakumar openly expressing their displeasure over Gayatri’s candidature, owing to their soured relations with Siddeshwara.After keeping themselves away from campaigning for over a week Renukacharya and Ravindrakumar were persuaded by Yediyurappa to work for Gayatri. But sources say they are not campaigning wholeheartedly.",Davanagere Lok Sabha constituency is certain to send a woman to the Lok Sabha this time as both major parties have nominated a woman candidate.

North Karnataka

region reaching a crescendo, TOI looks at five issues/factors which have dominated electioneering.

MAHADAYI DRINKING WATER PROJECT

NEHA MURDER

MODI & LINGAYATS

KHARGE, AHINDA VOTE BANK AND DEVELOPMENT

INFIGHTING IN BJP

Although the Mahadayi tribunal pronounced its verdict in 2018, and the central govt published it in its gazette in 2020, the project — seeking to provide drinking water to Dharwad, Belagavi and Gadag districts — has not moved an inch forward.The main reason for this is non-issuance of clearance by the Union forest and environment ministry. Congress has been highlighting the issue in constituencies of Mumbai Karnataka and is holding BJP responsible for the delay. BJP is countering it saying the project is mired in legal hurdles arising from Goa’s petition seeking nonissuance of environmental clearance and the Centre has no role to play.The murder of MBA student Neha Hiremath on a college campus in Hubballi in broad daylight has kicked off a political debate with BJP touting it as another incident of ‘love jihad’ and a result of what it calls ‘Muslim appeasement’ by Congress. Every single functionary of BJP from PM Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah down, have been referring to the murder in their election rallies to drive home the point that women are not safe under Congress in the state. BJP functionaries made a beeline to Neha’s house to offer condolences. Congress is highlighting its decision to set up a special investigation team to probe the incident and a speedy trial by a special court.Ever since Modi was made BJP’s PM candidate just before the 2014 elections, North Karnataka has been extending overwhelming support to him. In 2014, BJP won 11 of the 14 seats and in 2019 it swept the region. This has been in large part to Lingayats who have shown unflinching loyalty to the saffron party in parliamentary elections. Belgaum, Dharwad, Haveri, Shimoga, Davanagere and Bagalkot — all Lingayat dominated constituencies — have been electing BJP MPs since 2004 although they voted Congress in assembly elections 2013 and 2023. While BJP claims the Modi factor is at play this time too, Congress has dismissed it.A section of political functionaries suggest AICC president Mallikarjun Kharge stands a chance to head the INDIA bloc if it wins these elections. This could help Congress consolidate votes, especially in the four reserved constituencies in the region.Implementation of Congress’ five guarantees and its promise of providing Rs 1 lakh each to women head of families if it wins the national elections is another factor that can sway voters. Despite its inclusion in the Article 371 (J) of the Constitution and claims by successive govts of spending crores of rupees on development, the KalyanaKarnataka region continues to be backward in terms of infrastructure and on human development indices. This lack of development is another issue that may linger on voters’ minds on polling day.Unlike in 2019 when BJP appears a perfect picture of unity, the saffron party this time is battling dissidence in many seats. In Uttara Kannada, fire brand incumbent MP Anantkumar Hegde, who is upset over being denied ticket, is not campaigning for party candidate Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri. In Kalaburagi, former minister Malikayya Guttedar deserted BJP a few days ago and joined Congress. Another prominent leader Baburao Chinchansur is already in Congress. Both Guttedar and Chinchansur contributed majorly to Kharge’s defeat in 2019. In Bidar, BJP MLAs Prabhu Chavan and Sharanu Salagar have not been working for the party candidate and Union minister Bhagwanth Khuba. In Koppal, BJP’s incumbent MP Sanganna Karadi joined Congress after being denied the party ticket.","Campaigning for Tuesday’s second phase of elections covering 14 Lok Sabha segments mainly in North Karnataka is reaching a crescendo.

A convoy of vehicles swiftly navigates the narrow streets of Mahdan Hipparga.Stepping out of his airconditioned SUV, Sagar Khandre , a slender figure clad in an untucked white shirt and black pants, receives a warm welcome from the assembled villagers.They have congregated at the invitation of local Congressman RK Patil.Demonstrating his commitment to villagers and strategically acknowledging the significant Lingayat community, Sagar, 26, visits the local Lingayat mutt where he seeks blessings from elders.At 2pm, undeterred by the heat, Khandre, a BBA LLB graduate from a prestigious university in Bengaluru, embarks on his fourth campaign of the day within the taluk. With folded hands, he greets both youngsters and elderly as he walks briskly from group to group. His retinue struggles to keep up.The taluk’s status as a stronghold of Lingayats is emphasised with another visit to a local temple, dedicated to Khandeshwar, an epithet often associated with Lord Shiva.Locals announce his arrival to a small gathering of villagers who are eager to catch a glimpse of the young candidate. Both Khandre and local Congressmen are garlanded. He extends his wishes to everyone, urging them to vote for him in Tuesday’s poll.Asked about his chances of winning, Khandre responds in flawless English, “I am confident our party’s guarantees and the lack of work by the local BJP MP will assist me.”But Khandre isn’t taking anything for granted as his diligent work suggests. He says from the day his candidature was announced, he has covered 80% of the constituency. He plans to cover the remaining 20% by polling day.Moving from one small town to the next, traversing dusty, underdeveloped roads, Khandre’s convoy of Innovas and Fortuners highlights the vastness of the segment and the extensive travel required for introductions.Crackers go off when he arrives in Hadalgi and he then takes his place on a stage in a modest community hall. A significant crowd gathers to hear the young man speak. Most sit on the ground.As local functionaries set the stage, praising Khandre’s youth, commitment, legal background, and association with retired Supreme Court judges, he rehearses his speech as he waits his turn.Taking the mic, Sagar addresses the crowd in formal Kannada. He could easily be mistaken for his father, fourtime Bhalki MLA Eshwar Khandre. He points to the crowd and asks, “Have you seen our local MP? Has he done anything for Aland’s development?”He then promises to be accessible day or night, pledging to personally address all their concerns. He touches on issues like unemployment and the lack of industries. He assures the audience, “Regardless of the issue’s size, I will be there to resolve it,” he says.","Sagar Khandre is a BBA LLB graduate from a prestigious university in Bengaluru.

Sunak’s party suffers heavy losses in UK local elections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/sunaks-party-suffers-heavy-losses-in-uk-local-elections/articleshow/109829279.cms,"LONDON: Britain’s governing Conservative Party suffered heavy losses in local election results Friday, further cementing expectations that Labour Party will return to power after 14 years in a UK general election that will take place in the coming months. Labour won control of councils in England that the party hasn’t held for decades and was successful in a special by-election for Parliament that, if repeated in the general election, would lead to one of the Conservatives’ biggest-ever defeats.Though the results overall, admittedly on a low turnout, make for grim reading for PM Rishi Sunak , he was able to breathe a sigh of relief when Conservative mayor of Tees Valley in the northeast of England was reelected, albeit with a depressed share of the vote.The victory of Ben Houchen , who ran a very personal campaign, may be enough to cushion Sunak from any revolt by Conservative lawmakers.For Keir Starmer , Labour Party leader, it’s generally been a stellar set of results, with the only real negative coming in some areas with large Muslim populations, such as Blackburn and Oldham, where the party’s candidates appear to have suffered as a result of the leadership’s pro-Israel stance in the conflict in Gaza.","Britain's governing Conservative Party suffered heavy losses in local election results Friday.

Similarly, 454 aspirants will test their electoral fortunes from the 25 Lok Sabha segments of AP, marking a 42% increase compared to the 319 contestants in the 2019 polls.In 2019, since there was no alliance, the BJP , TDP, and Jana Sena each fielded their candidates from different constituencies. However, even after these three parties formed an alliance for the 2024 polls , the number of candidates in the fray has increased.While 173 BJP candidates were in the fray from the 175 assembly constituencies in 2019, TDP contested all 175 seats. On the other hand, the then-new entrant to electoral politics, Jana Sena, nominated 137 candidates on its own. Now, these three parties have formed an alliance and collectively fielded only 175 candidates, in accordance with their agreement. Despite expectations of the alliance reducing the number of contestants, there was actually a surge in nominations. The Election Commission of India ( ECI ) recently concluded the withdrawal and rejection process.The increase could be partially attributed to the surge in the number of registered unrecognised political parties (RUPPs). Five to 10 candidates from these little-known parties filed their papers from each constituency. Several independent political aspirants also entered the 2024 political arena. For instance, there are 46 contestants from the Tirupati assembly segment after withdrawals and rejections. Among these 46 candidates, 29 are independents alone, while thirteen belong to RUPPs. Only four candidates belong to recognised state or national political parties, including YSRCP, Jana Sena, Bahujan Samaj Party, and the Communist Party of India.Andhra Pradesh has witnessed a steady increase in the number of candidates with each passing election. For instance, in the erstwhile united Andhra Pradesh, 165 candidates entered the fray for the 1977 Lok Sabha election. By the 2014 polls, this number surged to 598. It further increased to 762 in the 2019 LS elections, with 319 aspirants from AP and 443 from Telangana . This has increased to 454 in the ongoing election.A similar trend is observed with the assembly constituencies. From 581 contestants in 1955 to 1,067 in 1967, the number skyrocketed to 2,118 by 2019. This has further increased to 2,387 in the ongoing election.The elections held in the 1950s and 1960s in Andhra Pradesh were characterised by the competition among three to four candidates within each constituency. However, this figure increased to an average of 12 candidates in the 2019 polls. As many as 34 candidates contended for victory in Guntur West in 2019, establishing a new benchmark back then. Nominations filed by 46 candidates for Tirupati assembly constituency for 2024 polls were accepted, which has set a new record in AP.

As a minister in [Prime Minister] Narendra Modi’s cabinet, I’ve managed the ministry efficiently, leaving no room for corruption. I’ve upgraded more than 700 govt schools in my constituency.■ No comments on that.■ I haven’t marginalised or disrespected any Lingayat leader. I prioritise unity across communities. In my constituency, all four MLAs are from Lingayat community, demonstrating our inclusivity. Both district presidents are also Lingayats. I value the blessings of all communities, including Lingayats, who have consistently supported me. Shettar hasn’t made any such allegation. It’s not true.■ We, the BJP, prioritise humanitarian values over electoral gains. In the case of Neha’s murder, despite her father’s political affiliation (Congress), I sought justice. I urged chief minister Siddaramaiah to establish a fast-track court and transfer the case to CBI, respecting the family’s wishes. While the state govt treated it lightly, we insisted on an independent investigation. Our commitment to victims transcends politics, we stand by them, combating injustice even beyond elections.■ Guarantee schemes won’t sway our poll prospects. Thousands of women attended our poll rallies despite the heatwave, suggesting they were backing us. People prioritise PM Modi for the nation, not guarantees.■ I want to focus on industrial growth, develop the complete Hubballi-Ankola rail line, and develop the Tadadi-Belekeri port, which will attract more investors.

RAE BARELI: Weeks of ‘will-he-won’t-he’ culminated Friday in Congress naming Rahul Gandhi as the candidate in the family bastion of Rae Bareli on the final day for nominations, setting the stage for the Gandhis and an entourage of loyalists to air-dash to the UP constituency just in time for the Wayanad MP to file his second set of papers this election.had reported in Friday’s edition that amid suspense over Rae Bareli and Amethi, Rahul was veering around to contesting from the former seat.Congress’s nomination for Amethi, the other party fortress that Rahul contested and lost to BJP’s Smriti Irani in 2019, also went down to the wire. Gandhi loyalist Kishori Lal Sharma made the cut in a last-minute announcement, infusing some drama into the exercise as two Congress teams headed in different directions to beat the deadline.“My mother has entrusted me with the responsibility of serving the constituency with great faith and has given me the opportunity to serve the community,” he wrote on X.“In the fight against injustice, I seek the love and blessings of my loved ones. I believe that in this fight to save the Constitution and democracy, all of you are standing with me.”AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra quoted her mother Sonia Gandhi as telling her a few days ago, “My family in Delhi is incomplete; it becomes complete only in Rae Bareli.”Sonia has been MP from Rae Bareli, first represented by her father-in-law Feroze Gandhi, since 2004.Rahul arrived at Amethi’s Fursatganj by a charter plane at 10.30am, accompanied by Sonia, Priyanka, brother-in-law Robert Vadra, AICC president Mallikarjun Kharge, and Congress veterans KC Venugopal and Ashok Gehlot.The team split into two groups, with Priyanka and Gehlot going to Amethi while the rest proceeded to Rae Bareli.In Amethi, Priyanka joined nominee Sharma’s roadshow and appealed to people to vote for “those who speak the truth and stand for justice”.Rahul and others reached the Bhuyemau guesthouse for a final check of his documents and waited for Priyanka to join them for the formality of the nomination. Around 1.30pm, Rahul’s cavalcade reached the Rae Bareli collectorate.Samajwadi Party functionaries, including two sitting MLAs, were with the Gandhi family throughout the process.About 30 minutes later, as confirmation arrived that Rahul had submitted his papers to the returning officer, Congress supporters erupted in celebration. Rahul left the collectorate around 2.45pm.His next stop was a house in the heart of town. As in every election, the family of Gaya Prasad Shukla had organised a puja for the well-being and victory of the Gandhi family’s representative.Gaya Prasad’s grandson Ramji Shukla toldthat Indira Gandhi started the tradition in 1967 when she reached Rae Bareli for her nomination.","Congress's nomination for Amethi, the other party fortress that Rahul contested and lost to BJP’s Smriti Irani in 2019, also went down to the wire.

"Sriramulu plays sympathy card in fight for survival against 'humble, accessible' rival",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/lok-sabha-elections/lok-sabha-election-news/sriramulu-plays-sympathy-card-in-fight-for-survival-against-humble-accessible-rival/articleshow/109830299.cms,"Anti-incumbency wave?

The contest in Bellary (ST reserved) Lok Sabha constituency has virtually been reduced to the Narendra Modi factor and the Congress govt's guarantee schemes. Though Congress holds six of eight assembly segments here, it is facing a formidable task in countering the Modi factor.BJP has fielded senior functionary and former minister B Sriramulu, while Congress nominated incumbent MLA of Sandur, E Tukaram.The constituency received ST reserved tag after the delimitation in 2008. The seat was a Congress pocket borough from 1952 to 2000, hitting national headlines when former AICC chief Sonia Gandhi defeated BJP's Sushma Swaraj from there in 1999. BJP wrested the seat from Congress in 2004 when Karunakar Reddy won, marking the start of the Reddy brothers' influence in the constituency. The party retained the seat from 2004 to 2019, barring the bypoll in 2018 when Congress' VS Ugrappa won.There is palpable anger among voters as most of the roads are still in bad shape, the long-pending Hospete-Gutti national highway work is progressing at a slow pace, there is water scarcity and an absence of air connectivity.Five Congress MLAs have plunged into campaigning to ensure their Sandur colleague goes to the Lok Sabha, invoking their party's guarantees to win over voters. Chief minister Siddaramaiah, his deputy DK Shivakumar, minister Santosh Lad, and other seniors are working aggressively to end the BJP's dominance in the constituency. Tukaram, who is into a record fourth consecutive term as MLA from 2008 and is known as a humble and accessible leader, is facing an election to the Upper House for the first time.Sriramulu, who had won the 2014 Lok Sabha election , is trying his luck again after his defeat in the 2023 assembly polls. The BJP's star campaigners, starting from Modi, are backing him to the hilt. The saffron party is banking on the Modi wave, development works by the Centre, and its own work when its govt was in power in the state.This election is certain to decide the political future of Sriramulu, who is looking for a rebirth after his humiliating defeat in 2023. He is playing the sympathy card and trying to strike an emotional chord in voters by asking them to elect him as it is a question of his survival. However, BJP is also facing an anti-incumbency wave as its sitting MP Devendrappa has restricted himself to Vijayanagara district after the division of Ballari and isn't active in the election now.Both candidates have completed the first phase of campaign, covering all eight assembly segments.The JD(S), which holds Hagaribommanahalli seat, is now supporting BJP. Sriramulu is also getting moral support with the merger of Kalyana Rajya Pragathi Paksha, floated by mining baron and MLA G Janardhana Reddy, with BJP. Although Reddy is restricted from entering the undivided Ballari district, his followers are with Sriramulu.Meanwhile, Congress is heavily banking on its guarantee schemes, its manifesto, and what is describes as the failures of BJP at both at the Centre and state level.With Ballari having the highest number of women voters, Congress is wooing them by highlighting its guarantee schemes like Shakti and Gruha Lakshmi.Sriramulu said there is a strong Modi wave which will help him win the seat, and people are fed up with the guarantee schemes since they have affected the state's development. He also mentioned the collapse of law and order in Karnataka and a lack of safety.However, a senior Congress functionary said there is no Modi wave, as people know the PM is an ""expert in spreading lies"". The Congress govt's guarantee schemes will help the party win Bellary seat, he asserted.Meanwhile, keen on scoring brownie points, both parties have taken note of the travails of Ballari city's jeans industry that is facing an unprecedented challenge from apparel makers of Gujarat. There are 500-600 jeans units in the city and they employ, directly and indirectly, a lakh people. Modi said he'll ensure that jeans becomes a 'Make in India' product, while Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has announced the development of a jeans apparel park in Ballari.","BJP has fielded senior functionary and former minister B Sriramulu, while Congress nominated incumbent MLA of Sandur, E Tukaram.

Rahul Gandhi 's candidature from Rae Bareli has brought back focus on political legacy being passed on from one generation to the next. Rahul has replaced mother Sonia Gandhi, who had represented the seat since 2004 until her election to Rajya Sabha this year. It was represented by Rahul's grandfather Feroze Gandhi (1952 & 1957)and later by his grandmother Indira Gandhi (1967 & 1971).This trend is also seen in Kaiserganj, Bahraich, Kairana and Bijnor where parents have passed on the baton to children.: Chandan Chauhan, the sitting RLD MLA from Meerapur, is seeking to make his Lok Sabha debut from Bijnor. He is the son of former MP Sanjay Singh Chauhan, who had won the seat in 2009, when RLD had a tie-up with BJP.BJP has replaced incumbent MP Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh with his younger son Karan, who is making his political debut. Karan's elder brother Prateek Bhushan is an MLA from Gonda. Brij Bhushan was elected MP from Kaiserganj thrice in 2009, 2014 and 2019. However, in view of sexual harassment controversy involving wrestlers, he was asked by BJP to make way for his son.BJP has replaced sitting MP Akshaibar Lal Gond with his son Anand Gond, whose educational qualifications include an MBA and PhD. Anand is involved in social activities. Akshaibar, a BJP veteran, has been a five-term MLA. Even though he was denied a ticket this time, considering Akshaibar's long association with the party, BJP rewarded his loyalty by fielding his son from Bahraich.Ikra Hasan, sister of Kairana's SP MLA Nahid Hasan, is in the fray from the LS seat that was once represented by her mother Tabassum Begum. Tabassum had won Kairana in the 2018 bypoll as he RLD candidate following the demise of BJP veteran Hukum Singh. Backed by SP, she had defeated Singh's daughter Mriganka, and was the first Muslim candidate to get elected to the Lok Sabha from UP after 2014.","Rahul Gandhi's candidature from Rae Bareli has brought back focus on political legacy being passed on from one generation to the next.

"Lok Sabha election Phase 4: Like 2019, it may not be a cakewalk for BJP in 5 reserved seats",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/lok-sabha-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/lok-sabha-election-phase-4-like-2019-it-may-not-be-a-cakewalk-for-bjp-in-5-reserved-seats/city/lucknow/lok-sabha-election-phase-4-like-2019-it-may-not-be-a-cakewalk-for-bjp-in-5-reserved-seats/articleshow/109830494.cms,"Elections in the fourth phase in Uttar Pradesh will see 13 seats up for grabs, of which five, the maximum in any phase, are reserved constituencies .In 2019, all five were won comfortably by BJP which gathered over 50% of the total votes cast in all the seats. This year, however, while the verdict is divided on whether BJP wins all seats or not, Dalit scholars and those following backward politics say that the ruling party is set to lose some of its support.Badri Narayan, an expert on Dalit politics , says that while Dalit votes will be divided among the candidates, the party which has support of the other communities will emerge victorious.""Traditionally, BSP does not do well in reserved constituencies as the Dalit vote gets divided among the candidates. This year, however, BSP has worked hard and may add 5-7% more votes to its kitty,"" he said, adding that with BSP chief Mayawati having raised the question of the party's very existence through this election, Jatavs are rallying behind her more strongly. He said that some Dalit votes may also go to the INDIA bloc but there is non-Jatav mobilisation in favour of BJP. The recent attempts at polarisation are likely to have worked, especially among Valmikis and Pasis, so BJP may still pull off all five seats,"" he said.Others believe that the issue of the Constitution and the fear that BJP may alter it if it returns to power, an issue which the Opposition is raising vociferously against the ruling party, has become more deeply embedded in the psyche of the backward and scheduled caste communities and will drive their decision on the party to vote for. This, they say, is evident in the change in BJP's campaign strategy which has moved from development to majority politics. Ravikant, associate professor at the department of Hindi, Lucknow University, believes that BJP could lose as much as 70% of the backward vote which propelled it to power in the 2019 elections.""This is a segment which looks at social engineering and is not moved by Hindu Muslim issues,"" said Ravikant, adding that Samajwadi Party 's selection of candidates this time has helped it in cementing support for itself even though Dalits are usually wary of voting for SP.""Valmikis and Sonkars among Dalits may vote on religious lines but not others. The only mistake made by the INDIA bloc members, SP and Congress, is that no tickets were given to people from the Kori and Dhobi communities. That said, SP has still given tickets to many other Dalit communities, of which there are 66 in UP, and very less to Yadavs,"" he said.Professor MP Ahirwar from the Banaras Hindu University says that in the last 10 years, this is the first time he believes BJP is on the defensive. However, he says, BJP's loss will be BSP's gain.""We are not hearing of 'Modi Guarantee' anymore and the discourse has moved to Hindu-Muslim politics. This is not cutting ice with Dalits, except for maybe a couple of communities. The election this time is on jobs and inflation, not religious politics. The fear of the Constitution being changed, in whatever way, of reservation under threat, is a bigger worry for Dalits. We are looking at a triangular fight where BSP is likely to be the biggest gainer,"" he said.","In 2019, all five seats were won comfortably by BJP which gathered over 50% of the total votes cast in all the seats.

West Delhi Parliamentary Constituency: Local issues big deal for biggest constituency,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/lok-sabha-elections/lok-sabha-election-news/local-issues-big-deal-for-biggest-constituency/articleshow/109830536.cms,"NEW DELHI: The West Delhi parliamentary constituency , the largest in Delhi with the highest number of voters , encompasses demographics and geographies, from the affluent neighbourhood of Dwarka and the bustling Rajouri market to the remote villages bordering Haryana and the humble lower middle class colonies.While the 2019 gave BJP 's Parvesh Sahib Singh Verma a grand majority with over 60% of the electors pressing the lotus on the EVMs, this time, the battle between BJP's Kamaljeet Sehrawat and AAP’s Mahabal Mishra, a former MP from the constituency who switched from Congress to AAP , could be fought on more than just party lines.The constituency's 25.7 lakh voters include OBCs (20.8%), Punjabis and Sikhs (20.8%), SCs (12.9%), Brahmins (9.9%), Jats (9.4%), Muslims (6.8%), Vaish (6.5%) and Yadavs (3.7%) and a significant number of Poorvanchali voters. The electorate has enumerated several poll issues, ranging from crime, inflation and traffic congestion to water and power outages, end-mile connectivity, employment and skill education.Ratnesh, who runs a general store in Dichaun Kalan, fretted about power supply. “We experience electricity cuts almost every alternate day, sometimes for six hours,” he grumbled. A young voter, Minku, who lives in Hari Nagar and works as a conductor in Delhi Transport Corporation, worries about govt jobs. “I just learnt that four DTC bus depots are being shut down. We will be relegated to working for private ride aggregators,” he sighed.Sita, a housewife in Matiala village, like all housewives, talked of the rising cost of living. “Everything is expensive now. We are finding it difficult to pay our children’s school fees. Basic groceries have also become costly. I want a government that will check the rising costs,” she said.Alongside household concerns are other issues. Contractor Sairam in Tilak Nagar said, “The news frightens us. An elected CM has been put behind bars right before the elections. We can’t support a regime which doesn’t have our interests at heart.”Several voters, disappointed by their MPs remaining inaccessible, declared that these polls need to be more than just Modi vs Rahul Gandhi or Kejriwal. As Kartar Singh, social worker in Najafgarh, remarked, “No doubt Modi has beefed up national security and lifted India’s image internationally, but when the local MP is missing, it angers us. Also, several good works done by the earlier Congress MP Mahabal Mishra were scrapped. People will definitely have that in mind while voting.”Meanwhile at Janakpuri, 19-year old Mohit Kumar, a first-time voter, says his career is uppermost and expects the next govt to boost employment. “I am doing an ITI diploma course and hope to get a job. While there are jobs in the market if you have the right skills, the rising cost of living makes me wonder if I can make it in the city with a fresher’s salary. The present govt is promoting skills, but it must also focus on wages,” said Kumar.Some voters have decided to vote for a party rather than the candidate. “BJP’s candidate used to be a municipal councillor. I think voting for such a candidate makes sense given there are more chances that BJP will form the govt at the Centre again,” reasoned Aman Agarwal at Sanyog Vihar near Dwarka.Political analysts expect the varying opinions to make the elections “absorbing”. Professor Chandrachud Singh of Hindu College commented, “In West Delhi, there are a sizable number of Poorvanchali voters. With Parvesh Verma not being renominated, I understand there is some discontent. But I see Mahabal Mishra rising due to several other issues, including anger among some Jats, price rise and unemployment.”Singh added that there was a huge difference between the last election and this. In 2019, he said, there was the Pulwama factor and Modi buzz. “That buzz seems much diminished this time,” the professor said. “So, there are chances that a non-BJP party will get past the post on the seat this time.”","The West Delhi parliamentary constituency is the largest in Delhi with the highest number of voters. The electorate has enumerated several poll issues, ranging from crime, inflation and traffic congestion to water and power outages.
