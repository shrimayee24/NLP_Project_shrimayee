Purvanchali influence in Delhi politics

The JDU seeks action from the BJP's leadership against Poonawalla for his comments.""The controversy started during a heated TV debate on Wednesday, in which Poonawalla made a jibe about AAP MLA Rituraj Jha's surname. The remark, which came after Jha used Poonawalla's surname to take a dig at him, was labeled abusive by the AAP.While Poonawalla has denied abusing anyone, accusing AAP of spreading lies and engaging in character assassination, the incident drew criticism even from within the BJP.BJP MP and prominent Purvanchali leader Manoj Tiwari expressed disapproval of Poonawallaâ€™s comments, urging him and AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal to apologise for using offensive language against the Purvanchali community.In a video posted on X, Tiwari said, ""I strongly condemn the words spoken by Shehzad Poonawalla (in the TV debate). No matter how much anyone provokes you, the party expects its workers to remain sensitive and maintain decorum.

Their concerns are particularly relevant as assembly polls approach, scheduled for February 5 with results to be declared on February 8.The upcoming election is widely viewed as a direct contest between the ruling AAP, in power since 2015, and the BJP, with the Congress striving to regain its earlier dominance in the capital.The incident has added a new layer of tension to an already charged political environment, with parties vying for support from the influential Purvanchali vote bank.",Janata Dal (United) demands action from ally BJP against its spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla.

Lingayat concerns add new twist to caste census row in Karnataka,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lingayat-concerns-add-new-twist-to-caste-census-row-in-karnataka/articleshow/117311327.cms,"BENGALURU: Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah announced Thursday that the much-anticipated Socio-Economic and Education Survey report - commonly called ""caste census"" - will be taken up for discussion at the next cabinet meeting. The report, currently sealed, will be opened in the cabinet hall two hours before the meeting, he added.This decision comes after govt faced criticism for deferring the report's release at Thursday's cabinet meeting, reportedly under pressure from various caste groups.The date of the next cabinet meeting is still undecided. Law and parliamentary affairs minister HK Patil defended the delay, citing administrative concerns. ""We will certainly open the sealed cover at the next cabinet,"" he said.State industries minister MB Patil, a prominent Lingayat face in the governing Congress, meanwhile said that excluding Lingayat sub-sects from the caste census report would amount to a grave injustice, comments that could trigger a political storm. ""Many Lingayat sub-sects have registered as Hindus due to reservation policies, but they remain part of the Lingayat community,"" Patil said. ""We need to bring these sub-sects under one umbrella. Only then will the true picture emerge. If they are left out, it's a mistake. If the report is correct, we are fine; if not, we will ask the CM to rectify it,"" MB Patil said. ""People belonging to Lingayat subsects have identified themselves as Hindu Ganiga, Hindu Sadhu, Hindu Banajiga, Hindu Reddy, and others to avail of reservations under categories 2A and 3A. This does not mean they are not Lingayats,"" MB Patil said. ""They must be counted as Lingayats regardless of what they have written; everyone knows these are Lingayat sub-castes.""State law and parliamentary affairs minister HK Patil dismissed reports that govt feared a backlash from dominant communities over alleged leaked numbers. ""This is just speculation. The report remains sealed and safely deposited in the treasury. No numbers from the official report have been made public,"" he added.The caste census, commissioned during Siddaramaiah's first tenure as CM in 2014, has been a topic of debate since its completion in 2016. Conducted at a cost of Rs 169 crore under the Backward Classes Commission led by H Kantharaju, the census findings remained in cold storage during successive govts, including the Congress-JD(S) coalition and BJP administrations. The final report, submitted by commission chief Jayaprakash Hegde in Feb 2024, is yet to be opened.RDPR minister Priyank Kharge stressed that the document is a socio-economic survey, not a caste census.

It has recommended reforms to ensure that the PM can face a no-confidence motion in parliament.To prevent the concentration of power in the hands of an individual or institution, it has proposed the creation of a constitutional body - national constitutional council (NCC) - to establish a system of checks and balances between the three branches of the state and the two executive positions - PM and president.This council would include the president, chief justice, PM, leaders of opposition of both houses, speakers and deputy speakers from the opposition, and a representative of other parties. The commission has recommended decentralising the judiciary by maintaining the unitary structure of Supreme Court, while establishing permanent high court benches with jurisdiction in all divisional cities.It has also provided a framework for an interim govt to be formed after the dissolution of parliament, and recommended that selection of advisers to such govts should be solely the NCC's responsibility.",The Constitution Reform Commission has recommended introducing a two-term limit on the PM's tenure.
