But the voter participation is considered high as opposition parties AIADMK and BJP had boycotted the bypolls, leaving the field open to just two main contenders - DMK and NTK.The Milkipur bypolls were a political grudge match in UP's Hindutva heartland of Ayodhya, giving BJP a shot at redemption after a shock Lok Sabha defeat in Faizabad just over eight months ago and Samajwadi Party a chance to close the contest.The bypolls were necessitated by incumbent Awadhesh Prasad vacating the seat after being elected to Parliament from Faizabad, of which Milkipur is an assembly segment.

NEW DELHI: Exit polls on the Delhi assembly election received expected reactions from the leaders across the political spectrum after most of the pollsters predicted a strong comeback for Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Delhi after 27 long years.The poll of exit polls gave a clear majority to BJP which is predicted to win 43 seats while the AAP may end up a distant second with only 26 seats.

"Delhi elections exit polls: Poll of polls predict shock AAP exit, return of BJP to Delhi after 27 years",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-elections-exit-polls-poll-of-polls-predict-shock-aap-exit-return-of-bjp-to-delhi-after-27-years/articleshow/117953759.cms,"Several exit polls conducted on Wednesday forecasted a win for the BJP over the ruling AAP in the Delhi assembly elections, while Congress was expected to gain little compared to previous elections. However, two exit polls indicated a potential victory for AAP, with several others suggesting a tight race favouring the BJP.A poll of polls suggests that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will regain power after 27 years, with predictions suggesting it may secure around 40 seats in the 70-member assembly. This would allow them to surpass the majority mark of 36 seats required to form a government.In contrast, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which has held power for two consecutive full terms, is forecasted to win approximately 30 seats. Meanwhile, the Congress party is expected to struggle significantly, with projections indicating they may secure only 0 to 1 seat.The Election Commission will release official results following the counting on February 8. Exit polls are predictions made by election survey agencies based on voter interviews immediately after they cast their votes, but they can differ significantly from actual outcomes. In the 2020 Delhi elections, many exit polls miscalculated their forecasts.Among those predicting a BJP victory, People's Pulse estimated that the NDA could secure between 51 and 60 seats, while AAP might obtain 10-19 seats, with Congress failing to win any. People's Insight suggested the NDA would get 40-44 seats, AAP 25-29 seats, and Congress 0-1 seat. The P-Marq poll projected 39-49 seats for BJP and allies, 21-31 for AAP, and 0-1 for Congress. JVC's exit poll indicated BJP and allies would achieve 39-45 seats, AAP 22-31 seats, and Congress 0-2. Poll Diary anticipated 42-50 seats for BJP and allies, while assigning AAP 18-25 seats and Congress 0-2. Chanakya Strategies forecasted BJP and allies at 39-44 seats, AAP at 25-28, and Congress at 2-3.Two surveys predicted AAP's success: Wee Preside estimated AAP at 46-52 seats against BJP's 18-23 and Congress's 0-1; Mind Brink Media projected AAP at 44-49 seats with BJP at 21-25 and Congress at 0-1.Matrize suggested a close contest with BJP-led NDA at 35-40 seats and AAP at 32-37, giving Congress 0-1 seats.DV Research anticipated AAP would secure between 26-34 seats while BJP and allies would get 36-44, again predicting zero for Congress.In the Delhi assembly of 70 members, a majority requires 36 seats. Currently, AAP holds 62 MLAs, BJP has eight, and Congress has none. The assembly elections took place on Wednesday, with results due on February 8. Approximately 58% of Delhi's 1.55 crore voters participated by 5pm on Wednesday.Several AAP leaders dismissed the exit polls' predictions, while BJP officials expressed confidence in their anticipated victory.The political dynamics in Delhi have shifted dramatically since the rise of AAP in 2013, which disrupted Congress's long-standing dominance in the region. The last two elections saw AAP winning decisively, with substantial majorities. However, recent trends suggest that voter sentiment may be changing, possibly influenced by various factors including governance issues and allegations of corruption against AAP leaders.Historically, exit polls have had mixed accuracy in predicting outcomes in Delhi elections. For instance, while they correctly anticipated AAP's victories in previous elections, they often underestimated the scale of those wins. In 2015 and 2020, exit polls projected closer contests than what ultimately transpired.","Several exit polls conducted on Wednesday forecasted a win for the BJP over the ruling AAP in the Delhi assembly elections.

If the BJP does win, it will end a near three-decade drought - 27 years, to be precise - for the saffron party in the state.The Matrize poll estimated that BJP would likely cross the majority mark, but only just, with a projected range of 35-40 seats in the 70-member House. P-Marq gave the saffron party a somewhat better range of 39-44 seats while People's Pulse put the figure at 51-60, a sweep nearly as comprehensive as AAP's in the last two assembly polls in 2015 and 2020.In contrast, WeePreside predicted AAP would win 46-52 seats, with BJP at best getting 23 seats. All four polls put the Congress tally at no more than one seat and even that was not a sure shot. For Congress, which was in office in Delhi for 15 years before AAP unseated it, that would mean its hopes of a significant revival in the national capital would once again be dashed.For AAP, a defeat at this stage where its most prominent leaders are facing cases, would be a body blow. If, on the other hand, BJP were to lose again, it will feel it missed out on a real opportunity to regain office in a small but politically high-profile territory.A few established pollsters like Axis My India, CVoter and Today's Chanakya, some of which have at various points in the recent past acquired a reputation for being accurate in their predictions, did not release any exit poll results on Wednesday.

DCP (South East) Ravi Kumar Singh, however, said a flying surveillance team was called to the spot to verify the allegations, but nothing was found.""We received a complaint... the FST team also responded to it and the allegation was verified, nothing of this kind was found,"" he said.AAP Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh alleged that a leader of the Valmiki community, Harish, was ""arrested"" at South Avenue police station.

I have spoken with the election observer, DCP and SHO. But Uday Gill has not been released yet,"" he added.Police, however, claimed Harish was detained on a complaint of ""distributing freebies and transporting voters to polling booths"".

Chaos erupted at Angelic Convent School in Maujpur after a voter, Poonam, claimed someone cast a vote in her name. The situation quickly escalated, with BJP workers involving the police.""It is happening at several other schools. People have been brought in from UP's Loni to vote in large numbers without proper photo verification. There are women in burqas whose identities aren't being checked,"" a BJP worker alleged.Police denied the charges, pointing to security deployed in the area.

He shared a video on X showing a woman sitting alone in an auto- near a barricade, alleging the obstruction was placed to prevent access to the polling station. DCP (South) Ankit Chauhan said only the elderly and those who can't walk were allowed to go to booths in vehicles while others were stopped 200 metres before the polling station.Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva alleged that AAP had stooped to ""fake voting"" as it was rattled by its ""imminent defeat"". He urged people to be wary of AAP's ""manipulations"".The New Delhi district election office said in a post on X that some alleged instances of relievers of polling agents not being allowed inside polling booths were reported by political parties. ""On-ground verification revealed that polling agents inside were unwilling to come out. Sector officers and presiding officers were sensitised to ensure the smooth relieving of polling agents,"" it said.Accusing Sisodia of resorting to ""hooliganism"", BJP's New Delhi candidate Parvesh Verma shared a video on X purportedly showing the AAP functionary angrily demanding action against BJP workers. ""Scared of defeat, AAP leaders are now showing pettiness,"" he posted.In Kasturba Nagar, police said they received information that two men allegedly attempted fake voting at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Andrews Ganj area. They were caught by Delhi Police and were being interrogated, according to sources.At a polling station near ITO, AAP's polling agents alleged the mock poll took place in their absence.

He does not believe in the constitution nor does he believe in constitutional institutions,"" Bihar deputy CM said.Adding that Kejriwal flip-flops between ""arrogance"" and ""discrediting constitutional institutions."" Deputy CM Sinha said, ""When this person (Arvind Kejriwal) wins the election. So he will sing his celebratory song in his arrogance. When he loses, he will stigmatize and discredit the constitutional institution and such people are not friendly to the nation. Punjab is an example of this.""His remarks come amidst Kejriwal's alleging on February 4 that the election commission and the Delhi Police are supporting hooliganism against AAP and protecting the BJP 's wrongdoing.Kejriwal took to social media to express his outrage, stating that the ECI and Delhi Police are working together to disrupt the electoral process and favour the BJP and claimed that their primary focus is to engage in hooliganism, protect the interests of BJP and distribute liquor and money.Meanwhile, voting in the Delhi Assembly elections concluded on Wednesday at 6 pm in all 11 districts of the national capital territory.The Bihar deputy CM also hit out at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi , while Gandhi is on a visit to Patna.Deputy CM Sinha claimed that just like Congress is being ""wiped out"" from the country, they will be defeated in the upcoming Bihar Assembly election too.""Today was Rahul Gandhi's visit. They (Congress) are being wiped from all over the country. In Bihar too, they are afraid...they discredited the word Bihari and abused the word Bihari with the same group of people. They cannot provoke the people of Bihar,"" Sinha said.During his visit to Patna, Gandhi accused the Bharatiya Janata Party of tokenism in Dalit representation .He claimed that while Dalits are being given representation, they are being denied any real power in decision-making processes.""In India's power structure today, whether it is education, health, corporate, business, judiciary, how much is your participation?... Dalits have been given representation but it means nothing if there is no participation in the power structure.

Today, it has become a fashion to give tickets to people from different castes, PM Modi also did this,"" Rahul Gandhi said during his programme in Patna, on the occasion of Jaglal Choudhary Jayanti.But then, you (PM Modi) snatched the powers of the MLAs.
