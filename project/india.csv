HYDERABAD: Telugu superstar Allu Arjun was released from Chanchalguda prison in Hyderabad early Saturday after spending a tense night behind bars, despite being granted interim bail by Telangana high court in connection with a stampede at Sandhya Theatre during the premiere of his film Pushpa 2 on Dec 4.The movie hall drew a massive crowd to see the actor, leading to chaos and the death of 37-year-old Revathi and critical injuries to her son. The stampede sparked widespread public outrage and raised questions about safety protocols at large public events. Arjun was arrested Friday along with three others in connection with the overcrowding at the theatre and the subsequent stampede. Two other accused were also granted interim bail.While HC granted interim bail for four weeks late Friday night, jail authorities delayed his release, citing procedural norms. ""The court's order reached the prison almost at midnight. However, it is the established practice in all state jails to release prisoners the same day only if the bail order is received before 8pm. Any order received after 8pm is processed the next morning at 5am,"" said a prison official. His lawyer said: ""We will pursue legal action against this illegal detention."" Prison officials said they would provide an explanation if the court sought one. Arjun exited the jail through the rear gate to avoid the crowds of fans gathered at the main entrance. Jail sources said Arjun was treated like any other inmate during his detention. He shared accommodation with two other accused, ate regular prison food, and made no special demands.Arjun said: ""It is unfortunate that a woman lost her life. I will personally support the family."" Telangana Congress chief Mahesh Kumar Goud defended the police action and dismissed claims of favouritism, despite Arjun's family connection to CM Revanth Reddy. ""Everyone is equal before the law,"" he said.","Allu Arjun was released from Chanchalguda prison in Hyderabad early Saturday.

NEW DELHI: BJP and its ally Shiv Sena Saturday countered Rahul Gandhi 's criticism of VD Savarkar , reminding the Congress neta that his grandmother and former PM Indira Gandhi had hailed the Hindutva ideologue as a ""remarkable son of India"" and issued a postage stamp in his honour.Launching a scathing attack on Congress, Shiv Sena MP Shrikant Shinde wondered whether Indira Gandhi was also anti-Constitution as she had praised Savarkar as a ""remarkable son of India"". He read out a letter written by Indira to Pandit Bakhle of the Swatantryaveer Savarkar Rashtriya Smarak on the occasion of the freedom fighter 's birth centenary celebrations. ""Was your grandmother also anti-Constitution? You have the habit of speaking nonsense about Savarkarji... But we revere Savarkarji, we are proud of him,"" Shinde said.The House witnessed tumultuous scenes when the Leader of Opposition sought to respond to Shinde's remarks, but was disallowed by the Chair.Shinde wondered whether Sena (UBT) agreed with Congress' views on Savarkar.Earlier, Rahul referred to Savarkar's criticism of the Constitution that there was ""nothing Indian about it"" to mount an attack on BJP. He said BJP is defaming and ridiculing its own ""supreme leader"" when it talks about protecting the Constitution.Hitting back, BJP's Nishikant Dubey said Rahul cannot be Savarkar in his entire lifetime. ""Indira Gandhi had issued a postage stamp in the honour of Veer Savarkar. In 1979, Indira made a donation of Rs 11,000 from her personal account to the Savarkar Trust.

""Rahul Gandhi can never be Savarkar and he should apologise to his grandmother,"" he said.BJP's Ravi Shankar Prasad suggested Rahul visit the Cellular Jail in Andaman and Nicobar Islands to understand the sufferings Savarkar underwent as a prisoner there. ""He has issues with Savarkar. He should visit the Cellular Jail where Savarkar was incarcerated for 11 years,"" Prasad said. ""One can speak anything to further one's politics, but one should not say such things for a person who made great sacrifices for the nation,"" he added.",Shrikant Shinde wondered whether Indira Gandhi was also anti-Constitution.

Nehru amended statute even before first poll was held: PM

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi Saturday slammed the Nehru-Gandhi family, calling them habitual violators of the Constitution, as he said his government's decisions in the past 10 years were aimed at boosting India's strength and unity in line with the Constitution's vision .""There is one family which has caused maximum damage to the Constitution. They spared no effort to undermine it. It started with the first PM Pandit Nehru and has since been running in the family,"" said Modi. ""They developed a taste for blood and turned the Constitution into a prey...""The attack came during his valedictory address to the two-day special session in Lok Sabha to mark the 75th anniversary of the promulgation of the Constitution. Modi used the occasion for a vigorous espousal of Uniform Civil Code , to highlight his decisions, and aggressively justify steps like Citizenship Amendment Act , and scrapping of Article 370.Modi turned the occasion into an opportunity to repulse the criticisms opposition had subjected him to through the LS campaign and afterwards. Some opposition MPs protested the PM's remarks but had to endure the assault perhaps because, with the Constitution being the subject, the option of staging a walk out was not available.In what was perhaps his first statement on CAA, the PM asserted that the law had been inspired by the concern of Mahatma Gandhi and other stalwarts for minorities in neighbouring countries. Modi also said that although Dr Ambedkar and other veterans, after intense deliberations, ruled out religion-based quota, Congress has tried to introduce it and has not given up even after being rebuffed by courts.The Nehru-Gandhi family, however, bore the maximum brunt. Though it looked like a riposte to leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi 's consistent attack on him for an alleged plot to scrap the caste quotas subverting the Constitution, Modi explained that he could not help mentioning the family which had been at the helm for 55 of the first 70 years since Independence. ""I am focused on the Constitution and have not strayed from the subject,"" said the PM repeatedly as he listed the amendments carried out by govts under Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi.""In fact, it started in 1951 when the first election had not even taken place. Nehruji was heading only an interim govt but that did not stop him from amending the Constitution through an ordinance to put curbs on freedom of press provided for by the stalwarts in the Constituent Assembly after due deliberation,"" the PM said. Modi said Nehru was convinced the Constitution could not be a restraint on him and even put this across to chief ministers, saying, ""Constitution cannot be allowed to be an impediment and should be cast aside if it comes in our way"".He said that the extra-constitutional tendency remained entrenched in the succeeding generations of the family. Modi listed the amendments carried out by Indira Gandhi during Emergency and the law enacted by Rajiv Gandhi to nullify the Supreme Court verdict in the Shah Bano case. ""This was a blow to attempt to do justice with a poor old lady and marked the capitulation to the hardliners because of vote bank considerations.""Recalling Emergency as the darkest chapter in the country's history, the PM said, ""Democracy was suspended and thousands were thrown into jail. It was imposed because Indira Gandhi wanted to stay in power despite having been unseated as an MP by the court. It is a blot that Congress will never be able to erase.""He gave the example of Rahul Gandhi tearing up the decision of the cabinet while also referring to former PM Manmohan Singh's reported admission about the Congress chief being the centre of power. ""It is sheer misfortune that Union Cabinet which is the supreme decision-making body accountable only to Parliament was forced to reverse itself because of an arrogant person,"" the PM said recalling UPA's dumping of the legislation it moved to protect convicted netas from being disqualified.Modi said it is because of the Constitution that he, despite his humble background, got to serve thrice as PM and said the entire range of his policies - from healthcare for all, construction of toilets and provision of free gas connection to one nation-one ration, creation of public digital infrastructure and expansion of physical infrastructure across the country - were all moulded by the vision that underpins the Constitution.",The attack came during his valedictory address to the two-day special session in Lok Sabha to mark the 75th anniversary of the promulgation of the Constitution.

'Garibi hatao' biggest 'jumla' in India's history'

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during a debate on the Constitution in Lok Sabha, tore into the Congress, saying the party ""will not be able to wash away the sin of Emergency"".In a reference to the national Emergency that was imposed by PM Indira Gandhi in 1975, PM Modi on Saturday said the Constitution was torn apart when it was completing 25 years as the rights of the citizens were snatched.""The Constitution was torn apart when it was completing 25 years; the Emergency was imposed (in 1975), all constitutional rights were snatched and the country was turned into a jail. All the rights of the citizens were snatched and there was a clampdown on media. Congress will never be able to clear this stain,"" PM Modi said.""I expected a good debate on the Constitution, but some decided to grieve their losses,"" PM Modi said in an attack on the Congress party.Narrowing his attack on the Gandhi family, the PM said: ""One family of Congress left no stone unturned in hurting the Constitution"".The family, having ""tasted blood"", repeatedly undermined the Constitution, he said, citing several decisions of Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi when they held the office of prime minister.Their next generation is also into the same game, he said in a swipe at the leader of opposition in the House Rahul Gandhi and his MP sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.""One Congress family changed the Constitution to attack freedom of expression, it insulted the founders of the Constitution. Nehru wrote to chief ministers that if the Constitution comes in the way it should be changed,"" PM Modi claimed in the Lower House.PM Modi said the Congress government under the Gandhi family over the years advocated to ""committed judiciary"" and even ""punished"" Justice HR Khanna , who ruled against Indira Gandhi's decision during the period of Emergency.""Seeds sown by first PM Nehru in changing the Constitution were followed up by Indira Gandhi who even overturned the SC decision. Indira Gandhi clipped the wings of courts through Constitutional amendments to capture judiciary,"" PM Modi asserted.PM Modi also hailed India's journey since the adoption of the Constitution in 1949 as ""extraordinary"", asserting that the country's ancient democratic roots have long been an inspiration for the world.India is not only a big democracy but it is the mother of democracy, he said in the Lok Sabha replying to a two-day debate on the 75 years of the adoption of the Constitution.""Our Constitution is the basis of our unity,"" he said.The PM said the biggest 'jumla' in the history of India was 'Garibi Hatao', a slogan given by former prime minister Indira Gandhi.""Our friends in the Congress use this term day and night. But this country knows, the biggest 'jumla' in India, which has been used by four generations, is 'garibi hatao',"" the PM Modi said, referring to the popular slogan given by Indira Gandhi.""It was a 'jumla' which helped them politically, but did not help the poor,"" Modi said.Garibi Hatao Desh Bachao (remove poverty, save the country) was the theme and slogan of Indira Gandhi's 1971 election campaign.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi tore into the Congress during a debate on the Constitution in Lok Sabha.

MUMBAI: Central Railway (CR) on Saturday stayed demolition of five unauthorised temples outside Dadar station amid escalating opposition from Sena UBT, later leading to protests from BJP members as well.Sena UBT criticised the demolition notices soon after they were issued on December 4. On Friday, party chief Uddhav Thackeray raised the pitch by accusing BJP of ""electoral Hindutva"" and saying it failed to protect Hindu temples, including a 80-year-old Hanuman temple on CR premises. He announced a 'maha-aarti' at the temple Saturday.However, Saturday afternoon, BJP MLA Mangal Prabhat Lodha announced a stay on the demolition. As party workers gathered outside the Hanuman temple, BJP functionaries, including Lodha and Kirit Somaiya, offered prayers. In the evening, a maha-aarti was conducted by Sena UBT's Aaditya Thackeray, who was accompanied by senior party members, including Sanjay Raut.With BMC polls approaching and Hindutva issue on electoral agenda, both parties tried to take credit for the stay. ""Mumbai BJP chief Ashish Shelar and I spoke to railways minister Ashwini Vaishnaw. Members of Bajrang Dal and VHP also spoke to him. A stay has been issued, and prayers can continue at the temple,"" said Lodha. Taking a dig at Sena UBT, he said, ""What is the need for a maha-aarti when a stay has already been issued? This is nothing but politics.""After emerging from maha-aarti, Aaditya said, ""The demolition was stayed because Uddhav Thackeray made it an issue. You can see what happens when our party puts its strength behind something. We have exposed the double-face of BJP, which uses Hindutva on a use-and-throw basis. They are responsible for demolition of many ancient temples."" He said builders bought land at profitable rates around Ayodhya temple. He added that the demolition order cannot only be stayed, but has to be withdrawn.The demolition notices, dated Dec 4, were issued by CR's assistant divisional engineer (Mumbai division), directing removal of the five temples within seven days for obstructing commuter movement and delaying redevelopment of Dadar station.","Sena UBT criticised the demolition notices soon after they were issued on December 4.
