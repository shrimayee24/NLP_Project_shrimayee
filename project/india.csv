"Ekal Patta case: SC revisits probe against Dhariwal, govt officials",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ekal-patta-case-sc-revisits-probe-against-dhariwal-govt-officials/articleshow/115068314.cms,"JAIPUR: A division bench of the Supreme Court on Tuesday overturned the Rajasthan high court ’s decision to dismiss the criminal proceedings against former UDH minister Shanti Dhariwal and senior UDH and Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) officials in the “Ekal Patta” case, which involves alleged corruption and procedural violations in the issuance of a lease deed for valuable land in Jaipur.The bench, comprising Justice Surya Kant and Justice Ujwal Bhuyan, has ordered the high court to re-evaluate the case from all angles. The order came a day after the Bhajan Lal Sharma-led BJP govt, altering its stance, requested to set aside the previous high court judgement in this case.Additional advocate general (AAG) Shiv Mangal Shar-ma, who represented the state govt, told TOI, “Former JDA officials granted approval for a land lease to one M/s Ganpati Constructions, which was earlier rejected by the UDH department. It was alleged that the rules were overlooked and the land deed was issued and rejected a few times.”During the hearing, the apex court examined whether the Rajasthan high court’s quashing of the proceedings and its permission to withdraw prosecution were justified. Sharma, during the proceedings, argued that the high court’s orders should not be sustained and that the case required adjudication based on merit as significant facts and allegations remained unresolved.“We requested the Supreme Court to get a comprehen-sive review of the case done as the Rajasthan high court, while granting relief to Dhariwal and others, including the then UDH principal secretary GS Sandhu, lacked a comprehensive review of the facts,” Sharma added.After hearing the arguments, the Supreme Court, setting aside the previous two orders of the high court, directed it to conduct a fresh, unbiased review of the entire case, including all evidence and procedural details. The apex court has also requested the chief justice of the Rajasthan high court to ensure meticulous handling of the re-evaluation, reinforcing the judicial stance on transparency and accountability . “The high court has been directed to complete its re-examination in six months,” Sharma said.","The bench, comprising Justice Surya Kant and Justice Ujwal Bhuyan, has ordered the high court to re-evaluate the case from all angles.

BJP MLAs marshalled out in J&K assembly bedlam over Article 370,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-mlas-marshalled-out-in-jk-assembly-bedlam-over-article-370/articleshow/115062107.cms,"This is a representational image

SRINAGAR: The J&K assembly resembled a fight club Thursday as BJP MLAs clashed with marshals after speaker Abdul Rahim Rather ordered the eviction of opposition members who were protesting the passage of a resolution on restoring the former state’s special status — revoked in 2019 with the abrogation of Article 370 The commotion began when independent MLA Sheikh Khursheed of jailed Baramulla MP Engineer Rashid’s Awami Ittehad Party displayed a banner advocating for Article 370 and 35A. BJP lawmakers stormed the well and tore the banner. The speaker briefly adjourned the House, but the BJP members continued their protest, refusing to heed calls for order.Upon resuming, leader of opposition Sunil Sharma of BJP opposed the assembly passing Wednesday the resolution — calling it a “drama”. This fuelled dissent among members in the treasury bench.Slogans filled the House as BJP MLAs chanted in support of Kashmir's integration with India: “Balidaan huway jahan Mukerjee woh Kashmir hamara hai.” National Conference (NC) members retorted by emphasising their allegiance to J&K: “Jis Kashmir ko khoon say seencha, woh Kashmir hamara hai.” CM Omar Abdullah looked grim and watched the yelling match silently.As tempers flared, speaker Rather directed marshals to remove BJP members, resulting in physical altercations. BJP MLA Shagun Parihar’s protest by standing on a table led woman marshals to intervene, intensifying the ruckus. Eventually, the speaker adjourned the proceedings for the day.The disruption stemmed from the resolution that urged the Union govt for a dialogue to restore the special status and constitutional protections afforded to J&K by Article 370.Later, J&K BJP president Sat Sharma said: “NC has brought the resolution. NC knows all too well that even if it is brought 100 times, they won’t succeed as long as PM Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah are at the Centre. They are doing this to distract people, disturb peace.”His predecessor Ravinder Raina said BJP will not allow Article 370 to be restored. “Article 370 has become history and it can never return,” he asserted.While deputy CM Surinder Choudhary and food minister Satish Sharma accused BJP of “driving a wedge between Kashmir and Jammu”, Peoples Conference chief and MLA Sajad Lone alleged that NC is playing a “fixed match” with BJP by passing a watered down resolution.“We demand the immediate rollback of Article 370, the restoration of statehood, and the complete nullification of the reorganisation act,” Lone said.Cabinet minister Sakina Itoo responded, saying Lone was a minister in the previous PDP-BJP govt through the “Nagpur quota”. “PM Modi used to be his elder brother,” said Itoo, referring to Lone’s earlier alliance with BJP.",J&K assembly resembled a fight club Thursday as BJP MLAs clashed with marshals.

Resolution to restore Article 370 an attempt to divide India: BJP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/resolution-to-restore-article-370-an-attempt-to-divide-india-bjp/articleshow/115062594.cms,"Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Smriti Irani (Pic credit: ANI)

NEW DELHI: BJP on Thursday said the resolution passed by the “INDI alliance” in the Jammu and Kashmir assembly to restore the special status of the erstwhile state was akin to “waging a war against the Indian constitution, Supreme Court and Parliament”.“I ask INDI alliance parties to explain who has given them rights to defy Supreme Court, Indian Constitution and Parliament. The resolution is a tactical support of Congress and its allies to terrorists and separatists,” BJP leader Smriti Irani said at a press conference. She said passage of the resolution seeking restoration of special status was an “attempt to divide India” by the INDIA bloc parties and added that BJP would not let them succeed in their effort.“I want to assure all leaders of the INDI alliance and citizens of the country that the abrogation of Article 370, passed by Parliament, will not be restored. And their effort to divide India will not succeed,” she added.Slamming the National Conference-led coalition govt for the resolution, Irani said, “The govt, elected through the democratic framework, is giving evidence of breaking India instead of working on development issues and uniting India.” After abrogation of Article 370, J&K witnessed a decline in terror incidents by 70& and deaths in such incidents came down by 80%, the former Union minister said.Irani also took on Congress over the resolution and asked the party leadership if it stood for terrorism.She also asked if the Congress-led “INDI alliance” stood against the “economic and constitutional interests” of J&K as well as the rights that the tribal population, Dalits, OBCs, women and children have got with the revocation of Article 370.“What they seek is special status for themselves, not the people of J&K,” she said.","BJP leader Smriti Irani said the resolution was akin to “waging a war against the Indian constitution, Supreme Court and Parliament’ Irani also took on Congress over the resolution and asked the party leadership if it stood for terrorism.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115062638,imgsize-929081,width-400,resizemode-4/115062638.jpg"
"Station master's 'OK' sends train, his life on wrong track",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/station-masters-ok-sends-train-his-life-on-wrong-track/articleshow/115064393.cms,"Train’s journey into Maoist-hit area cost Railways Rs3cr

RAIPUR: A train chugged off where it wasn't supposed to, railways suffered a Rs 3-crore loss, a station master was suspended, and a divorce battle dragged on for 12 years from Visakhapatnam to Supreme Court and Chhattisgarh's Durg - because of a cursory 'OK'.The station master had ended an angry phone call with his wife with the word, but it was mistaken for a go-ahead to send a train into Maoist territory, triggering this stranger-than-fiction chain of events.The station master hails from Visakhapatnam and his now divorced wife is from Durg. Court evidence shows they married on Oct 12, 2011, but the bride was unhappy due to her past relationship with another man, and her confession that she wasn't over it. This led to friction at home.The stationmaster appealed to her parents, who gave assurances, but the woman never stopped communicating with her lover. She would call him even with her husband sleeping right next to her.The marriage was already hanging by a thread when, one night, she called the stationmaster when he was on duty and they again quarrelled. Since he was at work, he ended the call by saying, ""We'll talk at home, OK?""He didn't realise that his work microphone was on. His colleague on the other end only heard the 'OK' and mistook it as the green signal to dispatch a freight train down a restricted route in a Maoist-affected area. Thankfully, there was no accident, yet it was a violation of night-time restrictions, and caused railways a loss of Rs 3 crore.The stationmaster was suspended. The punishment worsened his marital woes and the officer, now at the end of his tether, filed for divorce in a Visakhapatnam family court. His wife filed a complaint under IPC section 498A (cruelty and harassment) against him, his 70-year-old father, his elder brother, who is a govt employee, sister-in-law and maternal cousins.Saying she feared for her life, the woman moved Supreme Court and managed to get the case transferred to Durg. When the Durg family court rejected his divorce petition, the railwayman appealed to Chhattisgarh high court, his counsel Vipin Kumar Tiwari said.In a recent judgment, a division bench of Justices Rajani Dubey and Sanjay Kumar Jaiswal deemed the wife's actions ""cruelty"", reversed the family court judgment and granted the man divorce.HC found that the wife had falsely accused her husband of having an affair with his sister-in-law. The dowry and cruelty complaint also turned out to be false. The wife failed to give specific details of the dowry. Also, the cruelty charge against the in-laws could not be proved as they did not live with the couple.The division bench granted the husband divorce while noting that the wife's arguing with him on the phone, which led to the 'OK' incident, the filing of false reports, and making baseless accusations constituted mental cruelty towards him.","The station master had ended an angry phone call with his wife with the word, but it was mistaken for a go-ahead to send a train into Maoist territory.

The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections , which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases. The results will be declared on November 23, along with Maharashtra.In the Tribal-dominated state, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and CM Hemant's Soren Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) are in a direct fight, while the Congress party and Lalu Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) are in alliance with the JMM.The JMM-Congress-RJD alliance are also reportedly seeking to deal with Left parties, Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party and other tribal outfits that have been contesting the elections in the state as independent entities and make efforts to field candidates against the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) on all 81 seats collectively.In the last assembly polls in 2019, the JMM-Congress-RJD alliance won a comfortable majority of 47 seats in a House of 81.The BJP slipped to 25 seats from 37 it held in 2014. The poor performance was perceived to be the outcome of its decision to contest alone backfiring. The party did not foster an alliance with the Ajsu in the 2019 polls when Raghubar Das, currently the Odisha governor, was serving the state as CM.In this year's Lok Sabha polls in Jharkhand, the BJP-led NDA secured nine out of the 14 seats, with the BJP winning eight and its alliance partner, the Ajsu (All Jharkhand Students Union) Party, retaining its single seat.On the other hand, the opposition India bloc improved its tally, increasing its seat count from two in 2019 to five in the parliamentary polls.BJP and JMM have spruced up their pace of campaigning from the ground zero to social media. BJP and JMM leaders are actively rebutting and challenging each other on a range of issues, including illegal immigration, youth welfare, employment and housing.INDIA bloc parties in Jharkhand slammed the EC for holding assembly elections in the state along with that of Maharashtra but claimed that they were ready to slug it out with BJP-led NDA, which has welcomed the announcement of poll dates.JMM, Congress, and CPI (ML-L) said the announcement showed that EC was in a hurry to conduct elections though the assembly tenure was due to end in January next year.Also, both the INDIA bloc and BJP-led NDA are expected to get into huddles to discuss the modalities of seat-sharing which is going to be a challenge for both the competing teams.","The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections, which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra. Elections in Maharashtra will be held in single phase on November 20. The counting of votes will be on November 23.Maharashtra is gearing up for elections as the two major political alliances—the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) and the Mahayuti—prepare to face each other for the first time in a Vidhan Sabha election.The Maha Vikas Aghadi, comprise of the Congress, the Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray), and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) under Sharad Pawar, will go head-to-head with the Mahayuti , which includes the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Shiv Sena faction led by Eknath Shinde, and the NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar. This will be the first electoral contest between these two alliances since the splits within the Shiv Sena and NCP.The MVA is hopeful of replicating its recent Lok Sabha success, while the Mahayuti aims to retain power by leveraging its populist schemes targeted at women and youth. Both alliances have set their sights on winning the state.Narayan Rane, a former Union Minister and the victor in the Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg Lok Sabha constituency, is poised to be a key figure for the BJP in the Konkan region during the forthcoming elections. Meanwhile, two constituencies are expected to be critical battlegrounds: chief minister Eknath Shinde's Kopri-Pachpakdi seat in Thane City and Worli in Mumbai, where Aaditya Thackeray, a leader of the Shiv Sena (UBT), is seeking reelection.In the last Vidhan Sabha elections in 2019, the BJP secured 26.1% of the votes, the Congress 16.1%, the NCP 16.9%, and the Shiv Sena 16.6%. The BJP and the Shiv Sena (then united) formed the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which secured a majority. However, the coalition soon crumbled due to disagreements over government formation, plunging the state into a political crisis.After no party could establish a government, Maharashtra was placed under President's rule. Devendra Fadnavis was briefly sworn in as chief minister, with Ajit Pawar as deputy chief minister. However, both resigned just days later before a scheduled floor test.By November 28, 2019, a new coalition emerged, with the Shiv Sena (Uddhav faction), NCP (Sharad Pawar faction), and Congress forming the Maha Vikas Aghadi government, led by Uddhav Thackeray as chief minister.The state's politics took another turn in June, 2022, when Uddhav Thackeray resigned following a rebellion within the Shiv Sena, led by Eknath Shinde, who then allied with the BJP. Eknath Shinde assumed the role of chief minister, with Devendra Fadnavis returning as deputy chief minister.",The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra.
