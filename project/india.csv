'Rahul Gandhi's politics has changed': Smriti Irani dissects his new 'white T-shirt strategy',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rahul-gandhis-politics-has-changed-smriti-irani-dissects-his-new-white-t-shirt-strategy/articleshow/112894719.cms,"NEW DELHI: BJP leader Smriti Irani pointed out a noticeable shift in Congress leader Rahul Gandhi 's political strategy. Dissecting the evolution of Rahul's approach, Irani suggested that his newfound focus on caste politics and symbolic gestures marks a significant departure from his earlier tactics.In a recent podcast, Smriti Irani said, ""There has been a change in Rahul Gandhi's politics."" Highlighting that the Congress leader appears to believe he has finally tasted success after years of struggling to find his footing, she said, “When he (Rahul Gandhi) speaks about caste, he for the first time in his political career, speaks as an instrument.When he wears white T-shirt in Parliament, he knows what message he is trying to send to the youth.”She also noted that every gesture and statement from Gandhi is part of a broader, more calculated strategy. ""They're planning a different game in politics now, and these guys are far from naive,"" she added.Irani highlighted that Rahul's recent emphasis on caste politics is a deliberate move, a first in his career where he is using such a sensitive issue to resonate with the masses.Rahul's shift towards caste-based rhetoric is a response to his earlier failures in garnering mass appeal through other means. ""Rahul Gandhi couldn't gain traction by visiting temples, it was being ridiculed. Many people thought that it was deception,"" she said.Irani argues that this led him to pivot towards caste as a new strategy to gain political momentum. “He then thought if this isn't helping him gain traction. What else could work, caste could. So this is a part of his political strategy. If he had a political mindset, we would have seen it reflected in his political journey already”, Irani said.In the Lok Sabha election 2019, Irani emerged victorious against Rahul Gandhi, securing a lead of 55,120 votes. However, in the 2024 election, Congress candidate Kishori Lal Sharma managed to unseat Irani by a substantial margin of 1.67 lakh votes.","BJP leader Smriti Irani points out a noticeable shift in Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's political strategy.

Azad’s absence likely to impact his fledgling party in J&K,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/azads-absence-likely-to-impact-his-fledgling-party-in-jk/articleshow/112905459.cms,"SRINAGAR: The Democratic Progressive Azad Party ( DPAP ), founded by former Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad just two years ago, has virtually downed its shutters after Azad stepped back from campaigning for party candidates, citing bad health.Azad formed DPAP in Sept 2022 after resigning from Congress, when the Group of 20 within the party resented Congress’ style of functioning and demanded inner party democracy.Azad returned to his home ground Jammu & Kashmir with the impression that he would make waves in the Union Territory. However, he began to be considered BJP’s ally, which dented much of his credibility.Azad had won the Lok Sabha elections in 1980 and 1984 and was CM of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir from 2005 to 2008.Otherwise, he has been nominated to Rajya Sabha, along with a berth in the ministry, by Congress. But Azad criticised the Gandhi family in his recently published autobiography “Azad”, which soured his relationship with the Gandhis.People close to Azad say, his drawback is his inaccessibility. While Azad lost to BJP leader and Union minister Jitendra Singh from Udhampur in the Lok Sabha elections in 2014, the DPAP candidate was a distant third in 2024. His other candidates too could not win any of the seats in Jammu & Kashmir.Azad began losing his loyalists one by one, who wanted to return to Congress. Azad’s biggest shock came when GM Saroori, who contested against Jitendra Singh in the Lok Sabha polls this year, filed nomination as an Independent from Inderwal constituency, after his name did not figure in DPAP’s first list for the assembly elections. Saroori had resigned from the Congress along with Azad in Aug 2022.On Aug 25, Azad had issued a statement and stepped back from campaigning citing health issues. He said he developed chest pain and left for Delhi on Aug 26 and was admitted to AIIMS.Azad’s absence will impact seats like Doda and Bhaderwah, which get a significant number of votes from Azad’s native areas of Gundoh and Bhallessa.While DPAP candidate Abdul Majeed Wani would have gained advantage in Doda from Azad’s presence, on Bhaderwah seat, party candidate Muhammad Aslam Goni would be facing a tough time ahead in an already tight contest where Congress, BJP and National Conference have fielded their candidates.In other seats of Chenab Valley in the Jammu region where DPAP has fielded candidates, the party will have to garner votes without any known face.Azad, however, has made it clear that candidates should decide whether they can continue without his presence. “Candidates should assess whether they can continue without my presence. If they feel my absence would impact their chances, they have the freedom to withdraw their candidacy,” a DPAP statement said, quoting Azad.","Former Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad has stepped back from campaigning for party candidates, citing bad health.

Don't show us bloodshot eyes. Don't try to set India on fire with your politics of failure,"" Sarma said in a post on X.Sarma also said that divisive language does not suit Banerjee.Manipur chief minister N Biren Singh also condemned Banerjee's remarks and demanded a public apology to the Northeast and the rest of the nation.In a post on X, he wrote, ""How dare Didi threaten the Northeast? I condemn such irresponsible remarks in the strongest terms.

She threatened to stage a dharna outside Raj Bhavan if the governor delayed the bill's approval, with women at the forefront, accompanied by their brothers.The incident that sparked this controversy was the rape and murder of a trainee doctor at Kolkata's RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on August 9.
