PM should clear stand on 50% quota cap on reservations: Congress,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/clear-stand-on-50-quota-cap-congress-to-pm-modi/articleshow/109769291.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Congress on Wednesday asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to clear his stand on whether he will support an amendment to the Constitution to remove the 50% cap on reservation for SC/ST and OBCs to give them their rightful due.Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh accused the PM of distorting the Congress party manifesto by trying to give a “communal colour to it”.He said the party was categorically clear and said so in its manifesto too that it will do away with the 50% cap on reservations for SC/ST and OBCs. He denied the PM’s allegation about religion-based reservation saying it was a fake charge.Rubbishing the BJP brass’ denials, Congress said changing the Constitution has been the usual practice of BJP and highlighted that after the draft Constitution was adopted on November 26, 1949, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh said that it rejected the Constitution.Ramesh quoted an article from November 30, 1949 issue of RSS mouthpiece ‘Organiser’ to prove his point. Reading from the article, he said that “the RSS ideologues opposed the Constitution because it was neither inspired nor based on Manusmriti.”Ramesh alleged that when BJP is talking about “400 paar”, they are basically seeking the right to change the Constitution as the BJP and RSS are against “secularism and social justice"".He demanded that the PM clarify his stand instead of “constant diversion, distortion and defamation” of the opposition party. ""I want to ask the prime minister, who wants to give a communal colour to our Nyay Patra and wants to mislead, that will he remove the cap of 50% reservation for SCs, STs and OBCs?,"" Ramesh said.“We have always said that social and economic backwardness is the only basis for giving reservations. Because the Supreme Court has fixed the cap at 50% and some states have crossed this limit so we want to bring an amendment to the Constitution so that in states where the limit has been crossed they can get the legal status,” he explained.",Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh accused the PM of distorting the Congress party manifesto. He said the party was categorically clear and said so in its manifesto too that it will do away with the 50% cap on reservations for SC/ST and OBCs.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109763127,imgsize-2115564,width-400,resizemode-4/109763127.jpg"

Samajwadi Chhatra Sangh leaders

LUCKNOW: Leaders are born on campuses, they say. Taking a cue, hundreds of students, affiliated with different student wings, are busy contributing their bit in the Lok Sabha elections, despite the statewide ban on student union elections in universities and colleges.While some of these student leaders are excellent poets and slogan writers, others are shouldering the responsibility of war room, mobilizing youth vote or acting as foot soldiers of their respective political outfits.There are many who are handling social media platforms of politicians or have been entrusted with the task of conducting door-to-door campaigns.TOI talked to a few of these student leaders.Clad in dhoti and kurta, Vindhyavasni Shukla, 21, attends classes in Lucknow University's defence studies department and then rushes back to the party office to make a framework for how all ABVP student leaders will divide themselves and move in different directions of the state to strengthen party's vote bank, with special focus on youth.“I will be doing door-to-door campaigning in Mohanlalganj, Salempur, Unnao and Shravasti Lok Sabha seats. I wear dhoti and kurta to university to make students understand our party's message that advocates staying connected to roots and popularising Indian tradition and beliefs across the country,” said Vindhyavasni, who almost held a month-long protest for student union election revival.He said that recently PM Narendra Modi had also urged content creators to share stories on India's culture, heritage, and traditions with the world and I feel by adopting Indian traditional attire I am also doing my bit.“I have been working in the interest of students, be it of Lucknow University or any other college or university. Have been on a hunger strike and continuously protested for student issues like fees, scholarship problems and others which no other student outfit affiliated with other political parties did. Hence through my work, I am adding youth votes for my party,” he added.Like Shukla, other active student leaders have also been assigned their role.“I am shouldering the responsibility of communicating all govt schemes, working on statistics on how BJP government schemes benefited society at large,"" said BA student Abhijeet Kumar.ABVP student leaders Shashi Prakash Mishra and Utkarsh Tiwari who have good oration and writing skills are busy working on taglines, social media messages and poems for the party.“All NSUI student representatives in universities and colleges of different districts are setting up booth brigades, the members of which will not just be deputed at voting booths but will also campaign to bring youth to the booth to exercise their franchise,” said LU NSUI president Prince Prakash.“In war rooms, we have already assigned tasks to student leaders, while some are sending Rahul Gandhi's message, others are highlighting BJP's anti-democratic work or popularising the party through Facebook and Instagram reels, and YouTube videos,” he said.“Not just boys but girl NSUI representatives are also busy making slogans and caricatures advocating how Congress will be a people's party which guarantees employment for youth, zero religion and caste politics, development goals for the country and others,” he added.Another NSUI student leader and MA (sociology) student Vishal Singh said, “I along with other student leaders will campaign for our leader in Lok Sabha constituencies like Barabanki, Moradabad and Varanasi and will work towards connecting people with the party by highlighting the work done in Congress regime in the past.”“We have made slogans and posters of our leader Rahul Gandhi highlighting his efforts to empower the youth, farmers, women and laborers through Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra,” he said.“Be it Ekana cricket stadium, Lucknow Metro or Lucknow riverfront, all became a possibility during Samajwadi Party rule in Uttar Pradesh. We will run a picture campaign of these places on our social media platforms highlighting that opposition party rule failed to do such development which is visible and needs no evidence,"" said SCS student leader Mahendra Yadav.He said that apart from these student leaders have already left for campaigning in different directions, and our war rooms, booth in-charges and door-to-door student campaigners list are ready.","Hundreds of students, affiliated with different student wings, are busy contributing their bit in the Lok Sabha elections.

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Wednesday accused the Congress government in Karnataka of deliberately delaying action against suspended JD-S leader Prajwal Revanna in the obscene video case until after the voting in Vokkaliga-dominated areas concluded.""You did not initiate any action till the elections in the Vokkaliga belt were over.

Voting for TMC means voting for BJP, so it's better to vote for BJP only.

Only a Bangla-Birodhi can campaign for the BJP, which has repeatedly insulted Bengal's icons,"" the TMC said.TMC Rajya Sabha MP Saket Gokhale also criticized the Congress leader for his statements. In an X post, he said, ""Finally - from the B-team horse's mouth! Congress Bengal chief Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury publicly asks people in his rally to vote for the BJP and not the TMC. While Mamata Banerjee fights against the full might of Modi+Central Agencies machinery, Bengal Congress is openly asking votes for the BJP.""In response to Adhir's remark, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh stated that his party's objective is to reduce the BJP's numbers in West Bengal and that the TMC is a member of the INDIA bloc .""I haven't seen the video and don't know in which context he has said this but I want to make it clear that Congress party has just one aim that is to heavily decrease the number of seats of the BJP that it has got in 2019,"" said Ramesh.In West Bengal, a three-way contest is unfolding between the TMC, the Congress-Left alliance, and the BJP.Currently, the TMC holds 22 out of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in the state, while the BJP has 17, and the Congress has two MPs.","The Trinamool Congress (TMC) has accused Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury of being the ""B-team"" of the BJP.

(Today the relationship between Congress is clear- Congress’ hand is with Pakistan)”.“Pakistani leader – someone who has spewed venom against Bharat is promoting Rahul & Congress. Earlier Hafiz Saeed had said Congress is his favourite party.. Mani Aiyer went to Pakistan for support to depose PM Modi! We remember Pakistan Zindabad slogans were raised recently by Congress leaders & BK Hariprasad openly batted for Pak. Time & again Congress leaders defended Pakistani terrorists too,” Poonawalla said.“From Muslim League manifesto to becoming Muslim League that created Pakistan!

Such updation in many cases is not complete even till midnight as some parties from the remote stations may take more time to return.Thus it is only on the next day after polling (P+1), and in some cases two days (P+2) that the returning officers scrutinise Form 17, including any complaints and concerns, in the presence of candidates and their agents and enter the polling station-wise turnout data.Even this data may further get updated for any constituency where repoll is being conducted, on conclusion of repoll and arrival of parties.After complete data entry, the returning officers submit the constituency-wise data which is instantly visible on the voter turnout app.This time, for both the phases, the station-wise data was submitted on P+1 day. So while the turnout shown by the app at 12 midnight on April 19 and April 26 was 65.4%and 65.37%, respectively, the updated data submitted after all Form 17 records were scrutinised the evening after polling day was 66.14% for Phase 1 and 66.71% for Phase 2.“There was absolutely no delay in such disclosure on poll day... the narrative about non-disclosure of data is completely unfounded, without proper appreciation of the system in place,” a senior EC functionary said. “ Leave alone constituency, even booth data of votes polled is available with the candidates and cannot be changed at any stage.

Except Rajasthan and east Madhya Pradesh, elections remain to be held in most of the high heat impact states.Though north and central India could escape heatwave days in April due to five western disturbances (WDs), India faced two spells of heatwaves last month - from April 5 to 7 and April 15 to 30 — affecting mainly eastern India and southeast Peninsular.The number of heat wave days in April was the highest during 2010- 2024 (15 years) over Gangetic West Bengal and highest over Odisha during 2017- 2024 (9 years). Records show that Odisha faced the longest spell of heatwaves during 15-30 April (16 days) after April 2016 when it prevailed for 21 days.Mohapatra attributed the prolonged heat wave in April in these two states to the absence of thunderstorms and a persisting anticyclone at lower levels over the west central Bay of Bengal and the adjoining eastern coasts of India.On the rainfall front, IMD predicted the average precipitation over the country as a whole in May to be normal. “The normal to above-normal rainfall is likely over most parts of northwest India, some parts of central, peninsular and northeast India. The below normal rainfall is likely in remaining parts of the country,” it said.Although there are some exceptions, where ‘normal’ to ‘below normal’ max temperatures are likely, a vast area coinciding with nearly 200 LS seats which will vote over the next 4 phases is likely to face intense hot weather","In many states/UTs including Delhi, four of the remaining phases of parliamentary elections this month are likely to be held amid peak of hot weather.

Today, we don’t send dossier but give a dose to those harbouring terrorists inside their home,"" Modi said.The PM said, “Till Modi is alive, no one will be allowed to indulge in the dirty game of giving out quotas based on religion.”After days of upbraiding Congress for seeking to “snatch” reservations from Dalits , tribals and backward classes and offer these to Muslims, PM Narendra Modi vowed Wednesday that “till Modi is alive, no one will be allowed to indulge in the dirty game of giving out quotas based on religion”.Modi, whose poll caravan hit his native Gujarat ahead of the third phase of Lok Sabha polls on May 7, said at rallies in Deesa town of Banaskantha and Himmatnagar in adjoining Sabarkantha that Congress had been spreading canards about reservation and resorting to scare-mongering by saying the Constitution was under threat from BJP-led NDA.“I challenge them (Congress and INDIA bloc) to give in writing that they will never extend reservation on religious grounds, and that reservations for SC/STs andOBCs won’t be taken away. But they won’t accept this challenge as something fishy is going on,” the PM said in Deesa.On the opposition’s insinuation that NDA would abolish reservations in the long run, Modi said nothing could be farther from the truth. “Are they unaware that NDA has a clear majority (in Lok Sabha)? But we are not born to commit such a sin (as changing the Constitution).”The PM said it was Congress that posed a threat to the Constitution by attempting to change the structure of reservation by reducing quotas for Dalits and others as part of its “appeasement” policy.“They experimented with this in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. In Karnataka, they declared all Muslims as OBCs and took away a portion of OBC reservations. Is this acceptable?” he asked the crowd.Modi pointed out that despite being in office for so many years, Congress couldn’t implement constitutional safeguards for Dalits and OBCs in J&K. “But this is Modi. I nullified Article 370 and implemented the Constitution in J&K, after which people got their rights.”The PM dubbed Congress MP Rahul Gandhi’s “mohabbat ki dukaan” as “a factory for fake videos”. “Not just Congress’s videos, but their slogans, intentions and promises are all fake. The party that governed for 60 years, giving so many PMs, just can’t speak the truth now. Stop this game of fake videos. You can mislead people momentarily, but they will punish you heavily.”In Himmatnagar, Modi said INDIA bloc’s strategy was to cause anarchy and instability, and find new ways to insult him. In a riposte to Rahul’s charge that India would “burn” if Modi retained the reins, he asked why Congress didn’t honour Supreme Court’s judgment in the Shah Bano case if it respected the Constitution. “Muslim women were the worst sufferers of Congress’s vote-bank politics. We scrapped the triple talaq law that had ruined lakhs of families and gave them protection. Congress never showed the courage to do so.”The PM said Congress clearly hadn’t learnt its lessons from the 2014 and 2019 poll defeats. He predicted that the grand old party would suffer its “worst-ever” performance this election.","PM Narendra Modi hit out at the Congress-led UPA govt for going soft on terrorism. “Till Modi is alive, no one will be allowed to indulge in the dirty game of giving out quotas based on religion’, he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109763068,imgsize-1474776,width-400,resizemode-4/109763068.jpg"

With six candidates, BSP enters Lok Sabha poll fight in Delhi

Delhi's Lok Sabha seat contest involves AAP, Congress, BJP, and BSP. BSP declared candidates for six seats; South Delhi candidate pending. Mayawati's rally sought. Akash Anand to address. BSP confident in independent contest.

Incumbent BJP MP Mahesh Sharma faces a tough triangular contest in Gautam Budh Nagar. Rural discontent and strategic campaigning by opposition parties may pose challenges in the upcoming polls.

Lok Sabha elections Phase 2: Over 1200 candidates in fray for voting on 88 seats in 13 states

1,203 candidates contest across 88 seats in 13 states in the ongoing Lok Sabha elections. Key states like Kerala, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh impact the electoral landscape. The second phase of polling is pivotal in determining electoral outcomes.

AGRA: The Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), showcasing its influence in the initial phases of the Uttar Pradesh Lok Sabha elections, now braces for a daunting task in the third of the seven-phase elections encompassing 10 seats in western UP and the Rohilkhand region. BSP has historically faltered in securing victories in these constituencies, presenting a formidable challenge ahead.Since its peak in 2007, BSP’s electoral performance has been on a downward trajectory (see graphic). The 2014 general elections saw the BSP emerge as the third-largest national party in terms of vote percentage, but without a win in a single seat. In the 2019 Lok Sabha election, BSP in alliance with SP registered won 10 seats, all from UP.Despite this, the unwavering support of the Jatav community maintains BSP’s significance in UP politics. On May 10, Sambhal, Hathras, Agra, Fatehpur Sikri, Firozabad, Mainpuri, Etah, Badaun, Aonla, and Bareilly, will go to the polls, with BSP contesting on nine seats. Key constituencies like Mainpuri, Firozabad and Etah lean heavily on Yadav and OBC votes respectively, posing formidable challenges The third phase hinges significantly on Muslim and OBC votes, constituencies where BSP has placed its contenders. However, hurdles loom large due to the Yadav stronghold and a dearth of vote bank cadre. BSP’s plight in Bareilly is exacerbated as its candidate’s nomination stands rejected, effectively removing them from contention. Previously, in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, BSP secured victories in Sambhal and Fatehpur Sikri.While Agra and Fatehpur boast significant Dalit voter bases, Firozabad, Badaun and Mainpuri present tough contests with candidates closely associated with SP chief Akhilesh Yadav. Despite the hurdles, BSP remains cautious in candidate selection.In a strategic move, BSP challenges the SP-Congress alliance in Sambhal, Aonla, Etah, Firozabad, and Budaun by fielding Muslim candidates. Nonetheless, victories in these seats have historically eluded the party.The disqualification of BSP’s candidate in Bareilly tilts the scales in favour of BJP, particularly as the Gangwar vote bank holds sway. In Agra, BSP’s nomination of Pooja Amrohi, daughter of veteran Congress leader Satya Behn, adds intrigue to the contest. In Fatehpur Sikri, nomination of a Brahmin candidate spices up electoral dynamics. Mainpuri witnesses BSP’s challenge with a Yadav candidate, potentially disrupting SP candidate Dimple Yadav’s prospects.","The Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) now braces for a daunting task in the third of the seven-phase elections encompassing 10 seats in western UP and the Rohilkhand region.
