SRINAGAR: The resounding mandate for the INDIA bloc in J&K failed to hide the tame failure of Congress to live up to its pre-poll expectation of taking on BJP in its Hindu stronghold of Jammu. Congress won a lone seat in Jammu region, and that too via a minority candidate in the reserved Rajouri constituency. This is the worst performance of Congress in the region.Though Congress won five seats in Kashmir , it was expected to boost the alliance in Jammu, with better ground presence and appeal.Given the polarised nature of J&K after 2014, NC has taken a back seat while expecting Congress to fill the vacuum with Hindu voters and the middle class. The Lok Sabha trends showed an improvement in Congress's standing as its Lok Sabha candidates sharply cut the margins of victory of BJP nominees in Jammu and Udhampur seats.With Congress performing better nationally than was forecast in the 2024 LS contest, the party came to believe it was on a comeback trail, and Jammu became its target. In the alliance with NC, Congress got - seats to contest in Jammu. But the hopes fell by the wayside. Ally and NC chief Omar Abdullah had sounded the warning during the campaign by publicly stating that Congress was not focusing on Jammu where it was expected to do the heavylifting and thereby given the lion's share of seats. ""It does not matter what Congress does in Kashmir, what matters is how Congress fares in Jammu,"" Abdullah had remarked bitterly, slamming the ally for wrongly focusing on Kashmir.Congress' working presidents Raman Bhalla and Tara Chand, former MP Lal Singh, former state president Vikar Rasool Wani among others failed to win, though some of them lost by smaller margins. BJP gained directly from the Congress failure and boosted its tally to 29, the number of segments it led in the Lok Sabha polls.","Congress won a lone seat in Jammu region, and that too via a minority candidate in reserved Rajouri constituency.

SRINAGAR: PDP has been reduced to just three assembly seats but the picture to emerge in post-370 J&K is confusing, and may just give the party a lifeline to fight in future.PDP would have hoped for at least a double-digit tally to be a viable opposition. It's single digit finish is made worse by the fact that no member from the Mufti family would be in assembly - Mehbooba having skipped the contest and daughter Iltija losing from the home seat of Bijbehara.But with a small group confronting the govt in assembly, and a party with a name recall and known faces outside, PDP can try to reconnect with the masses and try to make a comeback.It will have to hold on to its MLAs who've proved fickle in the past. The fact is that PDP, in its 24th year of existence, faces a real existential threat.Putting up a brave front, Mehbooba said, ""These ups and downs are part of a party's political journey. But PDP has a vision and an agenda, and that will help us go forward with hope.""It leaves BJP with a decent contingent, but limited to Jammu, playing opposition. While the ruling combine would be hoping for early restoration of statehood and some sort of special status, the overwhelming mandate in its favour would nudge the alliance to challenge the Centre to restore powers of state govt that have been delegated to the LG.","PDP would have hoped for at least a double-digit tally to be a viable opposition.

NEW DELHI: BJP 's dreams of forming its first govt in J&K remains unfulfilled but it emerged the second largest party by winning 29 constituencies in the maiden assembly polls post nullification of Article 370 , improving on its all-time high of 25 seats recorded in 2014 elections.The party had expected a better performance of independents against the mainstream parties in the Valley and form the govt with their support, but the NC-Congress combine swept the polls, gaining a clear mandate.However, there is a sense of satisfaction among the BJP brass over a substantial rise in poll percentage across the region as they consider it as an endorsement of the Modi govt's decisions.""BJP has delivered its best performance so far. We have won 29 seats, and it is satisfying that we fought this election solely on the issue of development,"" said Union minister Jitendra Singh , MP from Udhampur.BJP suffered a setback with its Union Territory president Ravinder Raina losing from Nowshera constituency at the hands of National Conference . Also, the party failed to win any seat in Kashmir where most of its nearly two dozen candidates lost their security deposit.The party failed in its attempt to make inroads in Pir Panjal region of Rajouri and Poonch districts by fielding several turncoats from Gujjar and Pahari communities, including two former ministers - Choudhary Zulfikar Ali (Budhal) and Syed Mushtaq Bukhari (Surankote) - who lost by huge margins of 18,908 votes and 10,428 votes. Incidentally, 75-year-old Bukhari passed away on Oct 2.Besides the two former ministers, four ex-legislators, including Raina, lost to their rivals.However, 12 former legislators, including seven ministers, successfully contested the elections and mostly retained their seats. The rest of the party winners are new faces, including a former police officer, a university professor and an ex-bureaucrat took retirement recently to contest the elections.","The party had expected a better performance of independents against the mainstream parties in the Valley.

Faith and politics: NC's double-engine spiritual drive unified Muslim votes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/faith-and-politics-ncs-double-engine-spiritual-drive-unified-muslim-votes/articleshow/114059919.cms,"SRINAGAR: Some call it religious appeal. Some call it ""Peer-Mureedi"". Whatever it may be, the presence of two spiritual guides of different Muslim sects in National Conference's campaign consolidated the mood for the Omar Abdullah outfit and put it beyond the fight that PDP, newbies and independents could put up.Lok Sabha MPs Mian Altaf Ahmad of Anantnag-Rajouri and Syed Aga Ruhullah Mehdi of Srinagar are respected clerics, who were inseparable from Omar's travels across J&K in the cut-throat campaign that lasted over a month.The Mian family represents the revered spiritual seat of Gujjar-Bakarwal communities across J&K. While the community has a presence in parts of Kashmir, they are in good numbers in Jammu region as well. Interestingly, Mian Altaf's son Mehar Ali debuted from his erstwhile assembly seat of Kangan, which impeded the MP's movement in the party's campaigning. He addressed many rallies in Poonch and other regions of Jammu by video call, while apologising for being hobbled by his son's contest.Aga Ruhullah is a young and respected cleric of Shia sect which has a good presence in Srinagar-Budgam pockets, both of which have been swept by NC. In fact, Budgam that Omar chose as his second seat after Ganderbal this time was Aga's earlier assembly turf.Observers point out that beyond being representatives of individual sects, the two are also respected by the vast swathe of the Kashmiri community as also by Jammu Muslims. It works twofold - in taking the political campaign to individual groups, as also appealing to the larger religious umbrella.The strong mandate for NC is also reflective of the magic woven by the two MPs, whose families have had political roles besides their religious duties for decades.The Mian family has represented Kangan in Kashmir since 1951, going back to the MP's grandfather. In 2024 LS polls, Ahmad defeated PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti from Anantnag.At the same time, Aga Ruhullah's family has been active in Budgam politics for decades, and his father was assassinated by the militants. He himself was a three-term MLA and minister in the NC govt, before he became the MP in 2024.The NC decision to field its religious faces in the 2024 LS polls was shrewd. With PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti as candidate from Anantnag-Rajouri, Ahmad's candidature brought in the Gujjar-Bakarwal votes of Rajouri in Jammu to the NC base in Anantnag in Kashmir, delivering the party a big win over a star rival.At the same time, Ruhullah's candidature aggregated the average Srinagar voter, angry over abrogation of special status, with his sect that is in good strength in Srinagar. Aga became popular with his speeches against the reading down of Article 370 in 2019.Four months later, their status as star MPs raised them to the position of lynchpin of the NC campaign .",Lok Sabha MPs Mian Altaf Ahmad of Anantnag-Rajouri and Syed Aga Ruhullah Mehdi of Srinagar are respected clerics.

NEW DELHI: Wrestler-turned-politician Vinesh Phogat , contesting on a Congress ticket, won Julana constituency by a margin of 6,000 votes defeating Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate Yogesh Kumar, according to the Election Commission of India.The party last emerged victorious in Julana constituency in 2005. Phogat's victory marks a notable achievement as the party reclaimed the seat after 19 years.Julana assembly constituency is one of the 90 Legislative Assembly constituencies in Haryana , India.It is located in the Jind district. The Julana Assembly constituency falls under the Sonipat Lok Sabha constituency.The Election Commission rescheduled the polling date in Haryana to Oct 5 and accordingly revised the counting date for Haryana to Oct 8.The main candidates for this election were Yogesh Bairagi representing the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Vinesh Phogat from the Indian National Congress (INC).Indian freestyle wrestler Vinesh Phogat participates in the 53 kg weight category and hails from a family of wrestlers.

The protest targetted Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, the chief of the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI), who faces allegations of sexual harassment and criminal intimidation from seven female wrestlers. The alleged incidents reportedly occurred over a decade, from 2012 to 2022. The wrestlers demanded that a police complaint be filed against Singh and that he be arrested under the POCSO Act since one of the complainants is a minor.Vinesh announced her retirement from sports, a day after being disqualified from the ""Paris Olympics"" stating she no longer had the strength to continue. She was disqualified after being found 100 grams overweight during the weigh-in ahead of her gold medal match.Several political parties had announced their candidates for the Haryana Assembly Elections 2024 , specifically from the Julana constituency. The prominent parties fielding candidates included Bharatiya Janata Party, Indian National Congress, Indian National Lok Dal, and Aam Aadmi Party.Here is the list of 12 candidates who had contested in Haryana Assembly Elections 2024 from Julana constituency:Yogesh Kumar of Bharatiya Janata Party; Vinesh Phogat of Indian National Congress; Kavita Rani of Aam Aadmi Party; Surender Lather of Indian National Lok Dal; Amarjeet Dhanda of Jannayak Janta Party; Jogi Sunil Rashtriya of Garib Dal; Amit Sharma of Independent; Inderjeet of Independent; Coach Jasvir Singh Ahlawa of Independent; Prem of Independent; Bijender Kumar of Independent; Ramrattan of Independent.In the 2019 Haryana Assembly Elections, the Julana constituency had a total of 173,645 electors, with 126,375 valid votes cast.

NEW DELHI: The Congress has failed yet again in a direct electoral contest with the BJP - this time in Haryana. The grand-old-party which was confident, rather overconfident, of sweeping the Haryana assembly elections riding on anti-incumbency against 10 years of BJP rule, could manage to win only 37 seats. The ruling BJP, on the other hand, scripted history by scoring a record hat-trick in the state.Led by chief minister Nayab Singh Saini , the BJP has registered its best-ever performance in the state winning 48 seats, one more than its tally in 2014.So, what went wrong for the Congress?There could be many factors that led to party's dismal show. However, one of the biggest reasons was perhaps the factionalism in the state unit. The Congress leadership allowed former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda to take complete control of election strategy and campaign. In the process, it ignored the claims of other senior leaders of the state - particularly Kumari Selja , who is a prominent dalit face of the Congress. Selja was clearly unhappy with the dominance of Hooda in ticket distribution and stayed away from party's campaign for most part of the elections. The BJP leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, were quick to cite ""sulking Selja"" to accuse the Congress of disrespecting dalits in the party. At one point there were even reports of Selja dumping the Congress to join the BJP. However, Selja put these rumours to rest and asserted her loyalty to the grand-old-party after a meeting with Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge.But while Selja announced to stay with the party, her presence in the campaign lacked energy and was limited to photo-ops. The Congress high command did little to bridge this gap between the two top leaders. Little wonder, even before the final results were announced, knives were out in the Congress. Selja called for introspection and in a strong message said ""it will not be business as usual after the disappointing loss.""""The Haryana poll results are disappointing and I am pained at the disappointment of the Congress workers in the state who have worked very hard and were looking forward to forming their government after 10 years. It will not be business as usual in Haryana and I am sure the Congress high command would identify those who negated the efforts to bring the party to power after 10 years,"" Selja said in her first reaction.In a clear reference to Hooda's dominance, Selja also referred to factors affecting the organisation like taking everyone along and ensuring coordination among all the leaders in the state.This is not the first time that the Congress leadership has allowed state leaders to take complete control during assembly elections and suffer in the process. In Madhya Pradesh, Chhattigarh and Rajasthan - the three states which the Congress lost to BJP last year, the Congress leadership relied heavily on state leaders. In Madhya Pradesh, it was Kamal Nath who called the shots. He was the one who openly spurned alliance request of Samajwadi Party, leading to bitterness between the two parties. Fortunately for Congress, Akhilesh Yadav was not vindictive when it came to UP assembly elections and the two parties could manage to forge alliance for Lok Sabha polls and make impressive gains.In Rajasthan, it was Ashok Gehlot who dominated all party decisions from deciding tickets to planning strategy for the polls, much to the disappointment of Sachin Pilot. Sachin, who had revolted against Gehlot, stayed with the Congress after the intervention of the high command but could never get a complete say in party affairs in the state.Similarly, in Chhattisgarh it was Bhupesh Baghel who was at the centre of Congress's campaign. The Congress high command did try to address factionalism in state unit by making his rival TS Singh Deo deputy CM. But it was Baghel who dominated the Congress campaign in the state.The Congress would do good to learn its lessons from the Haryana verdict especially when it comes to assembly elections. Having strong state leadership is definitely an asset for parties, as Nayab Singh Saini was for the BJP in Haryana. But the BJP did a timely course correction and did not hesitate to remove the experienced Manohar Lal Khattar and bring in Saini to lead the party into elections.The Congress perhaps needs to take a leaf out of the BJP book and learn to bet on the winning horses. It could have at least prevailed upon Hooda to ensure more say for Selja in Haryana so that both leaders and their supporters could have worked together for the party's return to power in the state after 10 years.","The Congress has failed yet again in a direct electoral contest with the BJP.

NEW DELHI: As other politicians and party members switched on their televisions to see the assembly election results on Tuesday morning, former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister and National Conference (NC) vice president Omar Abdullah went on a 7km run. Posting some selfies on X, he wrote: ""Counting day 7K done. Last time around it didn’t end well for me personally. InshaAllah this time around it will be better.""It was indeed better for him this time.Just few months ago, Omar Abdullah contested Lok Sabha elections but lost the Lok Sabha elections to jailed Engineer Rashid from Baramulla constituency.This time, however, things have changed for both Omar Abdullah and his party.The NC leader, who initially refused to contest assembly elections till statehood of Jammu and Kashmir was restored, finally threw his hat in the race and contested from two seats. For the better part of the last five years, the 54-year-old former Union minister had ruled out his participation in the assembly polls in a Union territory set up. He had gone to the extent of saying that he would not humiliate himself by entering the Vidhan Sabha of a Union Territory.On the state level, his party emerged as the single largest party with 41 seats, according to Election Commission website at 5 pm. The party's alliance partner Congress secured 6 seats.It was also a prestige battle for Omar Abdullah. The significance of Abdullah's re-election bid from Ganderbal, the constituency he represented during his tenure as chief minister, was evident from his emotional appeal to the people when he filed his nomination. At a workers' meeting in the party office, the NC vice president removed his cap and held it in his hands, imploring the people to vote for him, saying, ""my honour lay in your hands"".Abdullah's sons, Zahir and Zamir, also actively campaigned for their father, while NC president Farooq Abdullah also addressed rallies to support his son's candidacy. When Omar Abdullah took over the leadership of the NC from his father in 2002, he contested the assembly polls from Ganderbal but lost to the PDP's Qazi Mohammad Afzal. However, he regained the seat from Afzal in the 2008 polls and became the youngest chief minister of the former state of Jammu and Kashmir.As elections were held after a decade in Jammu and Kashmir, Omar Abdullah's bet finally paid off as his party along with ally Congress secured 48 seats of 90, with NC emerging the single largest party with 42 seats.Farooq Abdullah has already announced that his son Omar will be the next chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir.The assembly election, held for the first time since the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019, is perhaps a redemption of sorts for the National Conference leader.And he has emerged a winner on both the seats -– Ganderbal and Budgam.","Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister and National Conference (NC) vice president Omar Abdullah went on a 7km run.

JAMMU: At just 29 years old, Shagun Parihar made history as the youngest winner of the 2024 J&K assembly elections . But her victory in Kishtwar , a district often marred by militancy, is more than just a political triumph — it is deeply personal.Shagun’s candidacy is poignant, rooted in personal tragedy. Hizbul Mujahideen terrorists gunned down her father and BJP functionary Ajit Parihar and her uncle Anil Parihar near their home before the panchayat elections on Nov 1, 2018.In a heartfelt speech Tuesday, she emphasised the heavy toll that years of conflict have taken on her community. “We have lost a large number of our soldiers. I have lost my father, and some have lost their brothers and sons. My first effort will be to ensure that every child here has the shadow of a father over his head, that there is peace and prosperity in the area. My efforts will be to bring happiness to every home.”Initially focused on her academic pursuits — she is currently pursuing a PhD —Shagun had no intentions of joining politics. Yet, her family legacy, combined with a sense of duty to her community, led her to step into the political arena.Shagun is one of just three women to have won in these elections. But her victory was no easy feat. She triumphed over Sajjad Ahmed Kichloo, a former minister and a prominent figure from NC and Firdous Ahmed Tak from PDP. In a tightly contested race, she secured 29,053 votes, defeating Kichloo by a slim margin of just 521 votes.By fielding Shagun, BJP made a strategic move to broaden its appeal in Kishtwar’s diverse religious landscape. With a large Muslim population and a smaller Hindu community, the district has long been a stronghold for NC, which had won the seat five times. BJP had first claimed the constituency in 2014, when Sunil Sharma won, but this latest win by Shagun has a deeper resonance for the people of Kishtwar.During the campaign, PM Narendra Modi acknowledged the gravity of Shagun’s personal history. Referring to her slain father and uncle, he said: “She is not just our candidate; she is the living example of BJP’s resolve to finish off terrorism .”As Shagun begins her new role, her focus remains clear: the safety, security, and prosperity of her community. “This victory is not just mine.

"BJP 1, NC-Congress 1, pollsters 0: Swings momentum back in BJP's favour ahead of slew of state battles",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-1-nc-cong-1-pollsters-0-swings-momentum-back-in-bjps-favour-ahead-of-slew-of-state-battles/articleshow/114057945.cms,"NEW DELHI: BJP snatched a record-making victory from the jaws of a widely predicted defeat in Haryana , returning for a third term. In Jammu and Kashmir, in its first election as a union territory, Omar Abdullah led National Conference to an emphatic win. Pollsters got both sets of predictions wrong, more dramatically in Haryana.It was BJP’s best-ever performance in Haryana.And it looked even more impressive because it came despite 10 years of incumbency, in the wake of a underwhelming performance in the Lok Saha polls and near-unanimous pundit opinion that Congress was going to score a win of landslide proportions.If the Haryana result, which enabled BJP to wrest back the momentum, once again underlined the hazards of predicting Indian elections, the performance of Omar Abdullah-led NC was no less impressive. The party swept the Muslim-dominated Kashmir, winning in 35 seats. These handsome pickings compensated for Congress’s failure to eat into BJP's Hindu votes in Jammu. NC’s big Valley win also pre-empted the much-apprehended possibility of the saffron party seeking to manufacture a majority by winning over independents and smaller parties, along with the help of five MLAs with voting rights that Lieutenant Governor is to nominate.NC's success came at the expense of its old rival, PDP, as well as new challengers, mainly Engineer Rashid, who had crushed Omar in Lok Sabha elections in Baramulla. This also put paid to the widely discussed BJP plan to appoint a Hindu from Jammu as CM of the Muslim-majority UT.But BJP has a lot to cheer about its performance in Jammu, where it made a near-clean sweep of the Hindu seats despite 10 years of double incumbency. The success achieved at Congress's expense, as Omar underlined in his post-verdict remarks, demonstrated the continued appeal of Modi and BJP's Hindutva-nationalist pitch as well as Congress's continuing inability to effectively challenge BJP in direct contests. Especially so when majoritarian sentiments are in play.In his post-verdict address to BJP workers, Modi celebrated free and fair polls in J&K as a victory of Indian democracy and congratulated the winner. Omar was equally conciliatory, describing PM and home minister as “men of honour” who would keep their promise for restoring statehood, emphasizing his intent to take along Jammu despite BJP 's “overwhelming performance” in the region and acknowledging the need to have a friendly Centre.However, BJP is not going to shy away from a fight should NC try to raise the ante over its pledge for the resurrection of Articles 370 and 35-A. If anything, such an NC posture will work to BJP’s advantage in the rest of the country.On Tuesday, the party led by PM focused on delighting in Congress's debacles in Haryana and Jammu. These results appear to have undercut the aura Rahul Gandhi had acquired after Congress improved its LS tally to 99. Congress swiftly switched to its default position of blaming EVMs, this time identifying batteries of ballot units as the villain.But it will have to contend with the reality that some of its pitches deployed in LS polls (attacks on Agnipath, promise of legally-guaranteed MSP, caste census, and the allegation about the Constitution and caste quotas being endangered under Modi) may have lost their punch.In the process, Congress also lost the “frontrunner” tag for the coming contests for Maharashtra and Jharkhand. In both states, it will have to deal with bigger seat sharing claims from allies. Never comfortable about being asked to follow Congress as junior alliance partners, INDA allies signalled their intent by not reinforcing Congress’s faulty EVM claims. Instead, they offered advice on the importance of taking everyone along and not getting complacent.","BJP snatched a record-making victory from the jaws of a widely predicted defeat in Haryana, returning for a third term.

Jammu & Kashmir results a victory for democracy; Haryana a befitting reply to Congress' lies: PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jammu-kashmir-results-a-victory-for-democracy-haryana-a-befitting-reply-to-congress-lies-pm-modi/articleshow/114058111.cms,"NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Tuesday launched a scathing attack on Congress and its “cronies”, accusing them of joining an international conspiracy to defame and destabilise the country and create social divisions, while following the “politics of falsehoods”.“For some time now, conspiracies are being hatched to weaken India’s democracy and social fabric.International conspiracies are being hatched. National parties like Congress and their cronies (chatte-batte) are involved in this game. Today, Haryana has given a befitting reply to every such conspiracy,” the PM said while he made a veiled reference of Rahul Gandhi, as someone born not with a silver but gold spoon being involved in the conspiracy.“Congress wants to build a nation where people hate its culture, don’t trust its institutions. Whether it is the Election Commission, defence forces, police or judiciary, Congress is trying to tarnish every institution. Till the Lok Sabha results came, they created a ruckus and even during elections , they along with allies and urban Naxal friends went up to the Supreme Court to raise doubts over the conduct of EC. Even today, Congress sought to mislead the people. Every time, they try to raise doubts over the objectivity of our institutions. It is their habit. Congress shamelessly has been doing this,” he said after the party’s historic third consecutive term in Haryana.Modi said the mandate was a befitting reply to Congress, describing it as a party that was against Dalits, OBCs and tribals.He said its leaders saw power as their birth right and behaved like a fish out of water when not in govt. “Desperate to return, they’ve resorted to spreading divisive caste politics, pitting the poor against each other. In Haryana, Congress rejected Dalit and OBC participation and openly threatened to end reservations. Their game is clear: trade the rights of the marginalised for votes,” he said.Modi said Congress aimed to weaken India by sowing discord among its people, inciting farmers and Dalits against the BJP. “Attempts to undermine our Army and youth have also failed, as Haryana’s youth rejected these divisive tactics. The message is clear: anti-national politics will not prevail. Despite ongoing conspiracies against India’s democracy, economy and social fabric, Haryana has responded decisively,” he said.He described Congress as a “parasite party”, which he said was further established after the poll verdicts in Haryana and J&K. “In the Lok Sabha polls too, most of Congress's wins came due to allies. Wherever allies trusted Congress, they sank. Congress has now become a liability, dragging down its own partners,” he said. Without naming National Conference, he added that in J&K, Congress’s partner feared it would lose seats due to the alliance. Modi said that across states, voters had rejected a second term for Congress with the last time this happened being in 2011 in Assam. In contrast, BJP had won consecutive terms in Gujarat, MP, UP and Uttarakhand with Haryana also on the list.Asserting that the unprecedented mandate will echo far and wide, the PM said, “In Haryana, development has triumphed over lies. This marks a new chapter in Haryana's political history.”Modi said after decades, J&K saw peaceful elections, with results marking a victory for India's Constitution and democracy. “While National Conference gained more seats, BJP emerged as the largest party by vote share,” he said as he extended congratulations to all winners.“Some said Kashmir would burn after Article 370’s removal, but instead, it blossomed. The massive voter turnout was heartening. For the first time, from MLAs to BDCs and DDCs, elected representatives are now shaping the future. We've restored the true spirit of the Constitution in J&K — what better tribute to Dr Babasahab Ambedkar than this?” he asked.Modi said the Haryana verdict would give a boost to efforts being taken to make India a developed country. He said farmers, youth, women and poor were the pillars of development in the country.","PM Narendra Modi accuses Congress of joining an international conspiracy to defame and destabilise the country.

Hoodannit? Haryana results mystery leaves Congress clueless,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hoodannit-haryana-results-mystery-leaves-congress-clueless/articleshow/114057998.cms,"Rahul Gandhi with Bhupinder Hooda and Kumari Selja on stage during an election rally in Haryana

CHANDIGARH: Till Monday evening, it was like a Test match with a predictable end. On Tuesday, Haryana election results turned into a T20 bout, swinging wildly from a perceived Congress sweep to a winning show by BJP , which beat strong anti-incumbency, a buoyant opposition following a good Lok Sabha outing and exit polls to be back in governance for a record third straight term in the state.BJP secured 48 seats, eight more than its 2019 result, achieving a comfortable majority in the 90-member assembly. The party surpassed its 2014 score, when it formed the govt on its own for the first time with 47 seats. Congress claimed 37 seats, Indian National Lok Dal ( INLD ) two, and Independents won in three constituencies.Congress increased its vote share by 11 percentage points and its overall share of 39.09% was almost at par with BJP’s 39.89%.Yet, the results came as a rude shock for Congress, which had been in celebratory mood since exit polls predicted its return with a huge majority. The party was outmanoeuvred by BJP’s strategy of focusing on OBC voters and division in Dalit votes.Congress had its own share of problems too — from overconfidence in its ranks and internal factionalism, particularly between former CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda and its Dalit face Kumari Selja, to making Hooda (and by default his son Deepender) responsible for all decisions in the state unit. Miscalculations in ticket distribution and lack of an organised grassroots cadre, added to the dismal show. As many as 15 sitting Congress MLAs were defeated in the election.The result also ended the “Hooda mystique” as, despite being given a free hand in choosing candidates and managing nominations for 72 of his supporters, he failed to capitalise on anti-incumbency against the 10-year BJP governance in Haryana.Hooda, who retained his seat by over 71,000 votes, said on Tuesday evening that the results have come as a surprise for the BJP too. “We are surprised by the results, and it’s not just us — even BJP is surprised by this mandate. This is how democracy works. We lost some seats by very thin margin, but it has been a shocking and unexpected outcome for us. At some places, there were complaints of problems in EVMs for which a Congress delegation would meet EC,” he said.Sirsa MP Kumari Selja, who was at loggerheads with Hooda during the campaign, described the Haryana results as “extremely disappointing.”“Our workers put in long hours, went to villages with the message of Rahul Gandhi. But, with these results, it looks like all their efforts have gone to waste. The party needs to take note of this. The party will have to introspect. Such an outcome should not have happened,” she said.The BJP narrative of ‘parchi and kharchi’, accusing Congress of planning to fill govt jobs by favouritism or corruption, appeared to have worked. On the contrary, issues highlighted by Congress and Rahul Gandhi — from farmers’ agitation and wrestlers’ protest to OPS and Agniveer — failed to bring dividends.In contrast, Congress highlighting these issues during the Lok Sabha polls earlier this year helped them win five out of 10 seats. Wrestler Vinesh Phogat, however, managed to win in Julana by over 6,000 votes.INLD, which saw a minor surge in its vote bank this time, also became a stumbling block for Congress, especially where its candidates lost by a thin margin due to INLD nominees.The Congress high command has called a meeting of party MLAs on Wednesday, Rajya Sabha MP Randeep Surjewala said. “Congress president and senior leadership called me to discuss some aspects,” Surjewala said.PM Narendra Modi thanked the people of Haryana for reposing their trust in the BJP. “I salute the people of Haryana for giving a clear majority to the BJP once again. This is the victory of the politics of development and good governance,” he posted on his X handle. The BJP govt would work tirelessly for the people of Haryana, he said, adding: “We will leave no stone unturned to fulfil their aspirations.”The results completely decimated Dushyant Chautala-led Jannayak Janata party (JJP) and AAP, which could not even open its account on any seat. Abhay Chautala led INLD, however, managed to secure two seats in its home district of Sirsa and emerged the third party in the assembly. However, both Dushyant and Abhay lost their elections.","BJP secured 48 seats, eight more than its 2019 result, achieving a comfortable majority in the 90-member assembly.

NEW DELHI: The exit polls have got it wrong once again. In Haryana, the BJP has scored an emphatic victory over the Congress, while in J&K, the National Conference-Congress alliance has won a majority. Both these results are contrary to what the pollsters had predicted in the exit polls.The poll of exit polls in Haryana had predicted a clean sweep for the Congress with most of the pollsters giving the grand-old-party above 50 seats and the BJP under 30.In J&K, the pollsters had predicted a hung assembly with the National Conference-Congress alliance ahead of the BJP.The exit polls had predicted a good show by the Congress in Haryana. Matrize gave 55 to 62 seats to the Congress, and only 18 to 24 seats to the ruling BJP. People's Pulse gave Congress 49 to 61 seats while the BJP 20 to 32 seats. Dainik Bhaskar predicted 44 to 54 seats for the Congress and 15 to 29 seats for the BJP. Dhruv Research gave 50 to 64 seats to the Congress and 22-32 seats to the BJP. However, the actual results are way off the mark, raising questions on the reliability of the exit poll process.In J&K, all the exit polls had given the National Conference and Congress alliance advantage but had predicted a hung assembly. The C-Voter-survey had projected the National Conference-Congress alliance would win 40-48 seats, while the BJP 20-25 seats. Dainik Bhaskar predicted the National Conference (NC)-Congress alliance to win 35-40 seats and the BJP to secure 20-25 seats. Axis My India polls predicted the NC-Congress alliance to win between 35 and 45 seats and the BJP 24-34 seats. However, the final results show a comfortable majority for the Congress and NC alliance.National Conference vice-president Omar Abdullah was not off the mark when he had called the exit polls ""just time pass"". ""I'm amazed channels are bothering with exit polls especially after the fiasco of the recent general elections. I'm ignoring all the noise on channels, social media, WhatsApp Etc because the only numbers that matter will be revealed on the 8th of Oct. The rest is just time pass,"" Abdullah had posted on X despite the fact that most of the exit polls had given his party an edge.In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, all exit polls had failed to catch the pulse of voters as they predicted landslide victory for the ruling BJP-led NDA. However, as it turned out, the NDA finished with just 293 seats when the actual results came. Unlike 2014 and 2019, the BJP failed to win simple majority on its own and ended up with 240 seats. This was 63 seats less from the 303 seats they had previously won in 2019. The Congress-led INDIA bloc bagged 235 seats proving most of the exit polls inaccurate. In the past also, there have been several elections when exit polls have failed to predict the results correctly.","In Haryana, the BJP has scored an emphatic victory over the Congress.

NEW DELHI: The victory in the Haryana assembly elections has been snatched from the Congress party and the system has been misused, MP Jairam Ramesh said on Tuesday and added that the party has been made to lose but it ""has not lost. ""As the BJP seems to retain Haryana, the Congress again blamed the system and the EVM machine for their loss in the election.At the press briefing, Jairam Ramesh said, ""Whatever analysis we have to do about Haryana, we will definitely do it.But first of all, we have to send the complaints that are coming from different districts to the Election Commission . What we did, what we did not do, where did we go wrong, there will definitely be an analysis of this. A committee will also be formed, this has been the practice in the Congress party and the analysis will be done after talking to everyone. But now is not the time for analysis. The most important thing right now is that the victory has been snatched from us, the system has been misused. The sentiments of the people and everyone felt that the ground reality was in favour of change but the result that has come today does not reflect that. There will definitely be an analysis.""""As far as the results are concerned Haryana result our first priority is to collate consolidate all the complaints that have come from candidates from the three districts today there will be other complaints and we hope to submit this to the Election commission tomorrow evening or day after. That is our immediate priority. Simultaneously of course we will sit and introspect why the result went the way it did. It was everybody's expectation that the Congress would win comfortably in Haryana. I think all I can say is that the Congress has been made to lose Congress has not lost. Congress has been made to lose in Haryana and you have not heard the last of the Haryana,"" the Congress MP said on being asked about the Haryana polls.In the Haryana election, the trends showed that the ruling BJP has crossed the majority mark in the Haryana assembly, while the Congress won 33 seats and leading on 4, till 6:00pm.Meanwhile, the Congress leaders also talked about the Jammu and Kashmir elections and expressed their dissatisfaction with the performance of their party. Jairam Ramesh reminded that the Congress party was in first place in Maharashtra during Lok Sabha elections.""In Jammu and Kashmir, we hope that soon NC and INC alliance government will be formed, a common program will be prepared and we will make every effort to fulfil the expectations of the people..."" he said.He further added, ""The chapter in Jammu and Kashmir, of course, there will be a coalition government. And as I said till yesterday, various attempts were being made to ensure that the majority will not come to the Congress-NC coalition but the people of Jammu and Kashmir have given a very clear mandate for this coalition government.""Congress leader Pawan Khera, who was also there at the press briefing said that after the 10 years of gap, an ""historical"" election was held in Jammu and Kashmir.""I congratulate the people of Jammu and Kashmir, they participated in this election with great enthusiasm and gave a befitting reply to those who had left no stone unturned in trampling the dignity of Jammu and Kashmir. Taking away the status of a full state and making it a Union Territory was unexpected in itself."" he said.","Congress MP Jairam Ramesh says the party has been made to lose but it ""has not lost"" The trends showed that the ruling BJP has crossed the majority mark in the Haryana assembly.

NEW DELHI: AAP sprang a surprise winning the Doda assembly seat in J&K but failed to open its account in Haryana despite contesting 88 seats, a major setback in Arvind Kejriwal ’s home state. AAP bargained hard in seat-sharing talks with Congress in Haryana but its candidates lost deposit in 87 seats months before Delhi assembly polls . Its vote share was 1.8%. In Doda, Mehraj Malik defeated BJP’s Gajay Singh Rana by 4,538 votes.The party got 0.5% vote share. & 19Tuesday’s poll outcome was a significant loss for AAP in Haryana, as it not only failed to open its account, but also ended up with a vote share of less than 2%. This was despite party supremo Arvind Kejriwal, who hails from Bhiwani’s Siwani, leading over a dozen roadshows and outreach events on his home turf after being released on bail and seeking votes for ‘Haryana ka Lal’.Kejriwal’s call to vote for him if he was honest and AAP’s emotive campaign failed to stir voters. The party carried out a high-voltage campaign, with all its netas — from Manish Sisodia to MPs Sanjay Singh and Raghav Chadha, along with Kejriwal — hitting the trail to intensify their attacks on BJP. They focused on issues ranging from corruption and misuse of agencies to unemployment, but their efforts failed to resonate with voters.Also AAP’s slew of “guarantees” like free electricity and healthcare, quality education, along with mohalla clinics and solutions to address unemployment didn’t have impact on people’s mindset. Except AAP candidate Adarsh Singh who ended up third with 43,813 votes in Jagadhri, all its 87 candidates are set to forfeit their security deposit.After alliance talks with Congress failed, AAP decided to contest 88 out of 90 seats in Haryana exuding confidence that it will be “key player”. In his campaigns, Kejriwal also asserted that no party can form govt in Haryana without AAP’s support. But the results tell another story. AAP got 2.48 lakh (1.8%). Its vote share was 0.5% in 2019 when it had contested 46 seats.Given that Congress snubbed AAP when it sought to ally with it in Haryana after numerous rounds of talks on seat-sharing, the result day saw AAP despite its poor performance send out a strong message to Congress with Kejriwal stating that the results show that no one should be over-confident. Without naming anyone, Kejriwal said, “Delhi assembly elections are around the corner. The first thing to keep in mind is to not take any election lightly. Today’s election results show that one should never be overconfident.”","The party got 0.5% vote share. In Doda, Mehraj Malik defeated BJP’s Gajay Singh Rana by 4,538 votes.

A king maker in 2019, Dushyant Chautala ’s JJP came a cropper. Chautala himself finished fifth in Uchana Kalan with less than 5% votes and was among 65 party candidates who lost their deposit.In the previous BJP-led govt in Haryana, Dushyant Chautala was deputy CM, a post he retained until six months ago when his party, Jannayak Janata Party or JJP, severed ties with the BJP.A majority of his MLAs left him soon thereafter, but the state polls were his big hope for a comeback. As the results rolled out on Tuesday, it became clear that this grandson of ex-CM Om Prakash Chautala and great-grandson of ex-deputy PM Devi Lal had lost even his deposit from the Uchana Kalan seat. Worse, the JJP has not won a single seat, and its vote share has dropped from 15% to less than 1%.Some consolation for dynastic democracy, though, is that the state’s three influential families of former CMs — Devi Lal, Bansi Lal, and Bhajan Lal — have managed to secure berths in the assembly. One member from each of the Bansi Lal and Bhajan Lal families and two members from Devi Lal’s family have made it to the legislature.Former CM Bhajan Lal’s son Chander Mohan (Panchkula), former deputy PM Devi Lal’s grandson Aditya Devi Lal (Dabwali), great-grandson Arjun Chautala (Rania) and former CM Bansi Lal’s grand-daughter Shruti Chaudhary (Tosham) emerged victorious.The Bhajan Lal family, however, suffered a major setback as Bhavya Bishnoi, grandson of Bhajan Lal and Kuldeep Bishnoi’s son, lost family’s traditional Adampur seat this time. Adampur had been represented by the Bhajan Lal family for more than five decades from 1968.As many as 14 members of famous Lal families were in the fray this time. These included three members each from the families of Bansi Lal and Bhajan Lal and eight members of Devi Lal’s family.","Dushyant Chautala was deputy CM in the previous BJP-led govt in Haryana.

CHANDIGARH: The famous phrase "" Aya Ram Gaya Ram "" widely used across the country for politicians switching loyalties has its origin from Haryana and it was because of one person, ' Gaya Lal ,' whose son Udai Bhan Singh is chief of Congress' Haryana unit at present. It was actually Gurgaon MP Rao Inderjit Singh's father and former Haryana CM, Rao Birender Singh who coined this term 57 years ago in 1967.Haryana had its first elections for state assembly in 1967 and Congress dissident Gaya Lal had contested and won as an Independent candidate from Hasanpur (reserved), now Hodal seat in Faridabad.In that election, a total of 16 independent candidates had won. At that time, the United Front as well as the Congress were eying support of Independent MLAs to form government.It was at that point Gaya Lal first joined the United Front but after a while, his heart changed, and he joined Congress. Again, within a few hours, he re-joined the United Front. With this, he switched his loyalty thrice in one day.On Gaya Lal switching his loyalty for the third time, Rao Birender Singh, former Haryana CM (March 24, 1967 to Nov 2, 1967) who was heading United Front, presented him before the media in Chandigarh and said: ""Jo Gaya Ram The, Wo Aaya Ram hao Gaye Hain"" (The person who had left earlier has come back). It was after Rao Birender Singh's announcement the phrase ""Aya Ram Gaya Ram"" became popular in politics, and was used for turncoats.Although several other legislators or politicians in Haryana changed their loyalties many times in their political career until the anti-defection law came into force, the maxim ""Aya Ram Gaya Ram"" is still linked with Gaya Lal. In 1972, Gaya Lal joined Arya Sabha and then jumped to Charan Singh's Bhartiya Lok Dal. He also joined Janata party before contesting his last assembly election in 1982 as an independent candidate.After 1967 polls, Gaya Lal was elected again in 1977 for one more time. He died in 2009.Interestingly, his son Udai Bhan, who is currently head of Haryana PCC, also faced charges under the anti-defection law for allegedly joining the Congress in 2004. At that time, he was an independent MLA from Hasanpur seat, having been elected in the 2000 state assembly elections.During the poll campaign, Ashok Tanwar switched over to the Congress hours after being part of a BJP poll rally.","Haryana had its first elections for state assembly in 1967 and Congress dissident Gaya Lal had contested and won as an Independent candidate from Hasanpur (reserved), now Hodal seat in Faridabad.

NEW DELHI: It was a small get-together organised by civic authorities in Chandigarh in the 1990s. The star attraction was a Congress stalwart who would later handle important responsibilities at Centre. While all eyes were focused on him, the Congress neta was struck by an unknown figure quietly seated in the last row with BJP figures. Curious, he inquired from his BJP contacts about the man sporting a salt-and-pepper beard.""He is Narendra Modi . It is not surprising that you don't know him. But soon, you will find yourself dealing with him,"" the BJP person said to introduce the man who had just taken over as general secretary in charge of Haryana It was the beginning of Modi's dizzyingly successful political innings as he worked to consolidate BJP's footprint in Haryana politics, boosting the morale of cadres that they should strive to win on their own and not live in a comfort zone, playing second fiddle to others.Modi dedicated himself to building a support base from ground up and Haryana is one region where he has worked extensively since 1999 when he was a BJP general secretary.The result of his lifelong dedication is reflected in the historic mandates he and BJP have received poll after poll and the 2024 elections is the latest addition to his tally of triumphs.Modi addressed four rallies in the state, including the last one in Palwal where the tent was jam-packed and the responsive crowd chanted, ""Bharosa dil se... BJP phir se.""BJP's hat-trick in Haryana came after the party's below-par performance in LS polls prompted a section of political pundits to draw a hasty conclusion that BJP's days were numbered and that Modi's popularity was on the wane. However, the party under Modi not only won the LS polls but registered victories in eight assembly polls in the last 12 months of which Haryana is the latest.""You all know Haryana is my second home,"" Modi said at an event in Haryana. His 'second home' hasn't disappointed him.",Modi dedicated himself to building a support base from ground up.

CHANDIGARH: After Congress staged a strong comeback, winning five of 10 Lok Sabha seats in Haryana, former CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda had emerged as the man of the moment for his party. Now, his inability to secure a majority for Congress to return to office in Haryana after a 10-year hiatus is likely to have a major impact on his political career , especially as his detractors have already started criticising his leadership.Given a free hand in ticket distribution and to lead the poll campaign, Hooda managed to get tickets for 72 of his loyalists but Congress fell short of the 46 seats needed to form govt.In 2019, Hooda's supporters and aides had said that had he been given full control of ticket distribution he could have ensured Congress's return in Haryana. In that election, Congress fell just 15 seats short of forming govt; this time, it was nine seats from a comeback.The results of the latest state polls have provided Congress's central leadership with a compelling reason to reassess and re-strategise. Hooda's critics within Congress have pointed to his centralisation of power in the state unit leadership as a key contributor to the setback. They argue that the departure of senior netas like Kiran Chaudhary & Kuldeep Bishnoi from the party in the recent past (they had accused Hooda of monopolising control) has now become a focal point for renewed criticism.Interestingly, Congress' leadership had picked Bhupinder Hooda as the party's new face in state politics by dislodging the stalwart Bhajan Lal in 2005. Hooda, then 57, had no administrative experience, was not an MLA in the state, and represented Rohtak Lok Sabha seat. He had become a star of Haryana politics in 1991 when he had defeated former deputy PM Devi Lal from Rohtak.By choosing Hooda, a Jat, the party high command sent a clear message that it wanted to give Haryana's populace a strong alternative to the Chautala family, whose stronghold lay in the rural belt and which led INLD, the most influential regional party in Haryana.However, within months of taking the reins of the state, Hooda not only took control of the party's state unit but also became a mass leader, demolishing his opponents in Congress as well in opposition INLD. He sidelined the Bhajan Lal family and their politics and even forced the former Congress stalwart to form his own outfit, Haryana Janhit Congress, led by his son Kuldeep Bishnoi. However, he shattered Kuldeep's dreams when, after the 2009 assembly polls, he managed to convince five of Kuldeep's MLAs to defect and merge with Congress to give an otherwise Congress minority govt a majority.Hooda has also faced several CBI & ED cases and has been accused of extending benefits to the Gandhi family, to Robert Vadra's companies, and of providing plots to Associated Journals Ltd, publisher of ""National Herald"" newspaper.",Bhupinder Singh Hooda had emerged as the man of the moment for his party. His inability to secure a majority for Congress to return to office in Haryana is likely to have a major impact on his political career.

"Infighting, Jat tilt put paid to Congress hopes in Haryana",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/infighting-jat-tilt-put-paid-to-congress-hopes-in-haryana/articleshow/114059225.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Haryana result reflects that Congress 's singular focus on employment, Agnipath, development and law and order failed to take into account the persistence of Jat vs non-Jat politics in the state. While the party believed people's issues, with the added impetus of populist announcements, would sway voters beyond caste appeal, the poll result has belied its expectation.After exit polls made Congress hopeful of a sweep in Haryana, result day was marked by a dramatic turn of events as the early trends soon got reversed.What appeared to be a close fight when counting started soon turned into a BJP show . It was nothing short of a shock defeat for Congress with its leaders alleging a conspiracy and saying that ""democracy had lost and the establishment had won"" in Haryana.The Lok Sabha results in May, where Congress managed to win five of the 10 seats in the state, had shored up its organisation but it also raised the possibility of greater infighting as Bhupinder Singh Hooda emerged from the success as the Congress's sole face. The insecurities among other leaders pushed them into a sulk or led them to focus on their kin.Hooda's failure to reach out to in-house rivals and accommodate them in the campaign and strategy created a gulf which, in the ultimate analysis, impacted the average Haryana voter. Kumari Selja's reported sulk was the talk of the campaign, as was the claim to the CM's post by multiple leaders. By all accounts, Hooda cornered the lion's share of candidates, pushing out the claims of other members.But where the party also missed a trick is in how it designed its campaign. The overt focus on wrestlers' protest was also seen to impress the Jat tilt of Congress, and the decision to field Olympian Vinesh Phogat may have been ill timed. Additionally, the absence of big Yadav or Punjabi faces in the Congress team, that could have undercut the BJP campaign on Jat vs non-Jat issue, also proved a major chink in the party's armour.","Congress's singular focus on employment, Agnipath, development and law and order failed to take into account the persistence of Jat vs non-Jat politics in the state.

JIND: Congress candidate and wrestler Vinesh Phogat won the Julana seat by a margin of close to 6,000 votes, defeating BJP 's Captain Yogi Bairegi in a closely contested election.Phogat's victory was marked by fluctuations, as she trailed in some of the 15 rounds of counting. She briefly left the counting centre when she was behind but returned after gaining a lead.Julana is considered a Jat-dominated seat, with around 1,85,000 voters, 50% of whom are Jat community members.Vinesh registered victory at 65,080 votes while BJP's Bairegi lagged behind at 59,065.Meanwhile, INLD-BSP Surender Lather also recorded 10,158 and JJP scored an abysmal 2,477 votes.Phogat's loss in the Olympics had evoked sympathy from the public, which likely contributed to her decision to contest the election and ultimately emerge victorious. While Phogat's win is significant, it came with a narrower margin than expected.Soon after the victory, Vinesh thanked the voters of Julana, calling it a victory for women.""This is the victory of my long struggle. This is a victory for women, and I am committed to serving the people of my constituency. I will work for the well-being of people and am committed to carrying out development works,"" she added.""This is the fight of every girl, every woman who chooses the path of struggle.

CHANDIGARH: Nayab Singh Saini is man of the match for BJP in Haryana, having helped it overcome 10 years of anti-incumbency to return it to power with an absolute majority and with its highest seat count.Replacing Manohar Lal Khattar with Saini as CM was seen as a desperate move to polarise Scheduled Castes (SC) and backward classes in March. Six months later, the experiment, it turns out, has worked well for the saffron party.BJP was able to capture a good chunk of SC/BC votes in addition to those of communities in the general category; OBCs and SCs have traditionally gone with Congress or regional parties.Khattar's alleged controversial statements that landed BJP in a spot, an untamed bureaucracy and issues like Parivar Pehchan Patra (PPP) and property IDs and inaccessibility of bigwigs had led to resentment among the party's cadre. Another threat came in the form of Congress consolidating votes, especially after BJP's loss in five seats in Lok Sabha elections.Picked by Khattar, Saini was initially dubbed as ""weak"" to be the CM. Both had started their political careers from RSS, with Saini being a computer operator. However, decisions taken by Saini during his 56 operational working days and coordination with RSS members helped the party.The early backing of Saini as CM face by the BJP high command, which included PM Modi, home minister Amit Shah and BJP president J P Nadda, induced confidence among party workers. Certain moves like the announcement of raising the limit of the creamy layer, correction of PPPs, property IDs, reservation for backward classes for promotion of employees and special packages for SCs too played their part.Donning the role of an aggressive politician, Saini countered the Congress's ""Haryana Maange Hisab"" campaigning by raking up alleged corruption during the previous Hooda govt, citing the ""parchi-kharchi"" system.In his personal capacity, Saini's gesture of attending to all those visiting him or being accessible till late evening hours and giving a patient hearing to workers and visitors made a difference, according to party office-bearers.",Nayab Singh Saini is man of the match for BJP in Haryana.

CHANDIGARH/NEW DELHI: BJP 's response to what seemed to be very strong anti-incumbency working against the Manohar Lal Khattar-led BJP-JJP coalition govt started early, even before the Lok Sabha polls, and was ruthless: it dropped its CM (in March), who had been at the helm for nine and a half years, and JJP, its ally of over four years, to appoint Nayab Singh Saini as CM.Saini (54), who like Khattar has an RSS background, belongs to an OBC community. This led to a consolidation of non-Jat votes that pushed BJP ahead of Congress in Haryana this assembly election.BJP hasn't just notched its highest seat tally, it has also bagged its best vote share of 39.9%, beating the Modi wave performance of 2014 when it first formed govt in Haryana on its own. Its vote share then was 6 percentage points lower.BJP had made clear that Saini would lead the party to the assembly polls as it focused on consolidation of non-Jat votes under its OBC leader. The Jat votes got split and INLD candidates hurt Congress nominees in many Jat heartland seats.BJP leaders involved in the polls said the appointment of an OBC CM had allowed them to successfully win back a section of Dalits who had voted against the party in the parliamentary elections. ""One of our successes was that we succeeded in changing the narrative of the Lok Sabha polls,"" a BJP leader said on condition of anonymity.BJP also targeted Congress as being ""anti-Dalit"" and used the sidelining of Congress MP Selja by former CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda to highlight the ""treatment"" of the Dalit politician, so much so that there was strong speculation that she would switch to BJP. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah, and other senior BJP politicians repeatedly highlighted ""how Congress was mistreating a Dalit leader and woman"". The Sirsa MP keeping her distance from the Hooda camp and not actively campaigning reduced Congress's appeal among Dalit voters.Congress relied excessively on Hooda, granting him control over ticket distribution, which led to 72 of his supporters getting party nominations, crowding out Selja and Randeep Surjewala's supporters. This alienated sections within the party, causing dissatisfaction.Hooda ignored strong opposition against some sitting MLAs and re-nominated unpopular candidates like Kuldeep Sharma and Jagbir Malik, which led to a backlash: 15 of the party's sitting MLAs were unable to retain their seats. BJP, in contrast, was ruthless, dropping sitting MLAs and ministers and nominating fresh faces.Rivalry between Selja and Hooda over ticket distribution and candidature for CM created divisions within Congress, weakened its campaign, and sent the wrong impression to voters.Congress had strong leadership but lacked the grassroots activists and micromanagement that BJP used to mobilise voters. RSS, which had kept away from the Lok Sabha polls, pitched in to help BJP.Both BJP and Congress faced rebellions from candidates not granted nominations, but the saffron party managed to get more disgruntled candidates to withdraw their nominations.After winning five of 10 Lok Sabha seats in June, Congress politicians had grown complacent and seemed to have assured themselves of victory. This led to a lacklustre campaign. BJP, however, was active, and support from Modi, Amit Shah, and a host of Union ministers and CMs of neighbouring states, imparted critical momentum to the state unit.BJP's historic third consecutive win in Haryana against the narrative of a Congress comeback comes as a much-needed respite for the party, allowing it to regain momentum and reinvigorate its cadres ahead of crucial assembly polls in Maharashtra and Jharkhand this year, followed by Delhi and Bihar in 2025.","BJP hasn't just notched its highest seat tally, it has also bagged its best vote share of 39.9%. The saffron party focused on consolidation of non-Jat votes under its OBC leader. The appointment of an OBC CM allowed them to successfully win back a section of Dalits who had voted against the party in the parliamentary elections.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114058780,imgsize-154330,width-400,resizemode-4/114058780.jpg"

JAIPUR/ALWAR: Seven cops in Rajasthan’s Bhiwadi have been suspended for allegedly tracking the location of their own woman SP for a month without authorisation.The cops from the cyber cell used SP Jyeshtha Maitreyi ’s mobile number to monitor her location and activities. Sources said the SP received confidential information about this on Oct 6. She did her own investigation and confirmed the tracking before suspending the cops Monday and reporting the matter to state police headquarters .The suspended officers include sub-inspector (SI) Shravan Joshi, in charge of the cyber cell, head constable Avneesh Kumar, and constables Rahul, Satish, Deepak, Bhim and Rohitash. They reportedly used cyber resources to trace the SP’s movements.State police chief UR Sahoo said he had sought a report from senior range officers on the matter. Jaipur Range IG Ajay Pal Lamba called such activities “very unfortunate” while expressing surprise about why the cops had been tracking the SP through her own district’s cyber cell. “For now, the policemen have been suspended, but if any criminal intent behind tracking the location is revealed, we will lodge an FIR and take further action,” Lamba told TOI.Maitreyi expressed disappointment. “I never expected that officers and staff from my own department would disappoint me in this way.

GUWAHATI: Nagaland CM Neiphiu Rio sought EAM S Jaishankar’s immediate intervention to halt the UK auction of a “19th-century horned Naga human skull”. Rio described the auction as an “act of dehumanisation that is considered as continued colonial violence upon our people”.Tetsworth-based Swan Fine Art’s website had listed the skull as among the items to go under the hammer on Wednesday but it was removed from the auction catalogue late Tuesday evening.It remains unclear whether the auction has been officially cancelled or the skull only removed from the website. Oxford University’s Pitt Rivers Museum — which houses anthropology and archaeology collections from various world cultures — posted on X that “the Naga ancestral remains have been withdrawn from sale”.A California-based Naga professor of anthropology, Dolly Kikon, had flagged this auction on X on Monday saying: “Naga ancestral human remains continue to be collector’s item in the 21st century!”In his letter to Jaishankar, Rio stated he has been informed by an organisation of Church leaders and representatives of a civil society group, Forum for Naga Reconciliation (FNR), about the auction of “Naga human remains”.“You will agree that the human remains of any deceased person belong to those people and their land. Moreover, the auctioning of human remains deeply hurts the sentiments of the people, is an act of dehumanisation and is considered as continued colonial violence upon our people,” Rio wrote to the external affairs minister.FNR informed Rio that skull value is estimated at £3,500-4,000 — Rs 3.85 lakh to Rs 4.4 lakh.",Nagaland CM Neiphiu Rio sought EAM S Jaishankar’s immediate intervention to halt the UK auction of a “19th-century horned Naga human skull” Rio described the auction as an “act of dehumanisation that is considered as continued colonial violence upon our people” The skull was removed from the auction catalogue late Tuesday evening.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114058665,imgsize-14586,width-400,resizemode-4/114058665.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The decisive mandate in Haryana and J&K rendered irrelevant smaller regional parties in the fray-JJP, INLD , AAP, in Haryana, and Mehbooba Mufti 's PDP, the Jamaat-e-Islami in J&K and newly formed outfits like Engineer Rashid's Awami Ittehad Party (AIP) in J&K.With decisive results in both states, there remains little scope for smaller players to play any part in either govt formation or in the opposition space.Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) that had emerged kingmaker in the last state polls was decimated this time, while Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) failed to create any impact, with key faces Dushyant Chautala and Abhay Singh Chautala losing their seats. While JJP failed to win any seats, down from 10 it won in 2019, INLD won two one more from what it had managed in the last state polls. JJP and Chandrashekhar Azad-led Azad Samaj Party (Kanshi Ram) together contested in Haryana, while INLD contested in alliance with Bahujan Samaj Party.In J&K, seven independents emerged victorious, marking an increase from the 2014 polls when three had won. PDP, which had formed govt in alliance with BJP in 2014, went down to just three, making it a difficult task to be back in the reckoning. The results have also culminated in a significant rejection of separatist candidates.","Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) that had emerged kingmaker in the last state polls was decimated this time.

NEW DELHI: Celebrations that started with bursting crackers, supporters distributing sweets, and the thumping beats of dhols at the Congress office, shifted venue as trends of Haryana assembly polls veered towards BJP , which scored its third consecutive win in the state on Tuesday.Initial trends showed BJP trailing behind Congress, leading to jubilation at the latter's headquarters, while that of BJP wore a sombre look, with a few people on its premises.The scenes changed around 10 am.Defying widespread perception of a Congress wave in the Jat-dominated state and pollsters' predictions, the saffron party surged ahead as votes were counted.Arrangements were made, and supporters thronged the headquarters.

NEW DELHI: In a landslide victory, the Jammu and Kashmir National Conference (JKNC) has secured 42 seats out of 90 constituencies in Jammu and Kashmir, marking a significant comeback after their previous win in 2015.This election is notable as it is the first in the Union Territory since the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019 and comes after a decade-long hiatus. Following the results, JKNC chief Farooq Abdullah stated, “People have given their mandate, they have proven that they don't accept the decision that was taken on August 5...Omar Abdullah will be the chief minister.”Omar Abdullah himself won the Budgam constituency by a margin of 36,010 votes and the Ganderbal constituency by 10574 votes. BJP leader G Kishan Reddy commented on the party's performance, stating, “This has been the BJP's best-ever performance since independence.” He further added, “INC tried its best to divide people on religion. They even took Pakistan's name during their campaign, saying they want an LOC trade with Pakistan and even hold talks. Despite all this, we won a good number of votes and seats. This has been the BJP's best-ever performance since independence... Haryana and J&K have become 'Congress mukt'... No party has won a majority in J&K so far... We will hold a meeting with the state representatives and the national leadership on our next step.”Meanwhile, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) celebrated its first victory in the Jammu and Kashmir assembly polls, with party candidate Mehraj Malik winning the Doda Assembly seat, defeating BJP's Gajay Singh Rana.People's Conference president Sajad Gani Lone remarked, “...I am thankful to the people of Handwara. There was a different wave all around but I am thankful to the people for this grand victory...I think there was an undercurrent, NC played its cards right...They also got help with the 3 years of misrule here...We want statehood to be restored and that Delhi stops experimenting...I think they (JKNC) will be able to form the government on its own...Our vote is for Opposition, not to sit with anyone. We have contested against NC, how can we go with them?”",Here are the winners from Jammu and Kashmir election: Jammu & Kashmir National Conference (JKNC) and Haryana Alliance.
