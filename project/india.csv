They had formally aligned themselves with BJP after being nominated to Rajya Sabha. Another such member in the nominated category who is part of BJP is Gulam Ali.

Rao later joined Congress.Election to these 11 seats in the coming months will possibly give eight seats to NDA and three to the INDIA bloc, including one from Telangana to Congress, bringing the party's tally to 27 — two more than what it needs to retain its leader of opposition post in Rajya Sabha.","Rakesh Sinha, Ram Shakal, Sonal Mansingh and Mahesh Jethmalani are the four nominated members who retired on Saturday.

This is in addition to Nitish Kumar-led Janata Dal (United)'s demand to accord 'special category' status to one of the most backward states in the country, something that the Bihar chief minister is unrelenting on despite BJP ministers maintaining that this kind of a dispensation is no longer possible.JD(U) functionaries said rules can be tweaked to address a long-pending concern of the state, especially after the creation of Jharkhand more than two decades ago.""It is within the realm of powers of any govt to devise policies to address the imbalance,"" a party source told TOI.While Andhra Pradesh too had similar demands, CM Chandrababu Naidu is now seeking specific projects and a package for the backward regions of the state which too was bifurcated to create Telangana. He gave a long list of projects from an oil refinery to a push for petrochemicals when he recently met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and top Union ministers.The special status issue flagged by two major constituents of NDA will be dealt with by the 16th Finance Commission chaired by economist Arvind Panagariya when it presents its report towards the end of 2025 as several other states have been demanding the tag as well.For the time being, Bihar govt has sought finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman 's intervention to deal with the flood problem especially because it involves Nepal. Any restriction of flow of water will have to be dealt with bilaterally with the neighbouring country, but the state govt's proposals are meant to build infrastructure to address the issue domestically, as far as possible, a source familiar with the discussions told TOI. The state govt is hoping for some announcements in the Budget.Along with infrastructure-related proposals, the state has also asked for support in centrally sponsored schemes, suggesting that the Centre should take over the state's contribution as well. Bihar, however, is focused on driving the best bargain given the current political situation at the Centre with representatives from BJP as well as JD(U) knocking on the Centre's doors.JD(U) is studying Naidu's proposals and is expected to have a more detailed wish list in the months ahead with party representatives suggesting that the coalition with BJP is a long-term partnership and everything cannot be delivered through one Budget.",Bihar government has approached the Centre with a demand to announce flood mitigation measures.

The potholes are now filled with rainwater.In Feb this year, NHAI had agreed to pay Rs 4.9 crore for the repair of the highway to PWD. But the work is yet to start.“The repair work was supposed to be done before the Lok Sabha elections. Till now, only some patchwork has been done, which doesn’t even last for a day.The rain has just started, god knows how we will commute in the coming days,” said Vicky, a resident of Loni.About 10kms of DelhiSaharanpur Highway 709B came under NHAI, but was handed over to PWD. Due to the lack of timely repair work on this route, it has become dilapidated. Vehicular movement on this highway has become taxing especially during the monsoon. Due to potholes, vehicles often overturn and crash.“ L o n i M L A N a n d Kishore Gurjar had also raised the issue in the Assembly for the repair of the highway. At the same time, officials had also raised this issue with the local MP and Union minister of state for road transport. But nothing seems to be working out for this road, which is a lifeline for the commuters” said Arun Panchal, another resident of Loni.For commuters, using this road has become more difficult during the monsoon as vehicles are often not able to spot the potholes. The lack of a proper drainage network, clogged sewers and restricted traffic flow have further aggravated the problem.Ram Raja, assistant engineer, PWD, said, “Repair work on the road was done and potholes were filled. However, due to the lack of a proper drainage system, the sewer water overflows on the roads, which is the reason why the repair work does not last for a long time. We have spoken to the concerned authorities to address this problem.”","In Feb this year, NHAI had agreed to pay Rs 4.9 crore for the repair of the highway to PWD. But the work is yet to start.

BJP to stage protest

BENGALURU: The govt is expected to introduce key legislation , including Gig Workers Social Security bill, SC/ST outsource reservation bill, and Greater Bangalore Authority bill among others in what is expected to be a stormy nine-day monsoon session of the legislature beginning Monday.Despite Congress ’ overwhelming majority in the Lower House, the govt led by chief minister Siddaramaiah is likely to face a reinvigorated NDA opposition comprising BJP and JD(S).In previous sessions, the opposition failed to put the govt on the mat, but this time it has gained solid grounds to attack the govt.The primary focus will likely be on the Mysuru Urban Development Authority (Muda) site ‘scam’, which directly implicates Siddaramaiah’s wife Parvathi. She allegedly obtained 14 alternative sites. The Valmiki welfare corporation scam, which led to the resignation and arrest of former ST welfare minister B Nagendra by Enforcement Directorate (ED), will provide added ammunition.But both opposition parties will miss some of their seasoned frontrunners. JD(S) is likely to pick either HD Revanna or GT Devegowda as its floor leader since HD Kumaraswamy has moved to the Lok Sabha and has been elevated Union minister. Revanna’s candidacy though may be hindered by recent rape and sex assault scandals involving his sons, who are currently in jail.BJP too will miss former CM Basavaraj Bommai , now an MP. It will be led by opposition leader R Ashoka, even while the party’s central brass deliberates on his continued leadership in the Lower House. BY Vijayendra , party’s state president, will play a pivotal role in anchoring the alliance’s efforts in challenging the govt over the scams.In the Upper House, the NDA alliance will seek to fill the void left by opposition leader Kota Srinivas Poojary’s election as MP. They may turn to new entrant and former MLA CT Ravi with former chief whip N Ravi Kumar offering support until a new floor leader is elected. Overall, three MLAs and an MLC were elected as MPs in May.The solid performance in the Lok Sabha elections, including the defeat of deputy CM DK Shivakumar’s brother DK Suresh, is expected to rejuvenate the NDA alliance.Meanwhile, Congress is likely to target BJP over delayed drought relief from the central govt and the sex scandals involving the first family of JD(S). They may also ply a narrative that BJP has lost the confidence of the people nationwide, after its poor show in the Lok Sabha polls. Siddaramaiah on Sunday assessed the govt’s readiness to face the opposition’s challenges on financial and administrative issues.Ahead of the session on Monday, BJP will stage a dharna at Legislature House to protest the Maharshi Valmiki development corporation scam. Protesters will gather at Maharishi Valmiki statue in a symbolic protest.",The nine-day monsoon session of the legislature begins Monday. The govt led by chief minister Siddaramaiah is likely to face a reinvigorated NDA opposition.
