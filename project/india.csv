BJP attacks Rahul Gandhi

NEW DELHI: Congress on Sunday stopped short of agreeing with its senior leader Digvijay Singh after he gave example of Rashtriya Swayamseva Sangh ( RSS ) to call for organisational reforms within Congress.Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera, reacting to former Madhya Pradesh chief minister's remarks said that an organisation known for Godse can not teach anything to a organisation founded by Gandhi.""There's nothing to learn from the RSS. What can an organisation known for Godse teach an organisation founded by Gandhi?"" Khera said.Earlier on Saturday Digvijay praised the organisational strength of RSS and shared a black-and-white photograph from a social media platform that showed Prime Minister Narendra Modi seated back on the ground while BJP veteran Lal Krishna Advani sat on a chair in the background, acknowledging how the RSS shapes leadership within the organisation.""I found this image on the Quora site. It’s very impressive. How an RSS grassroots swayamsevak and Jan Sangh BJP worker sat on the floor at the feet of leaders and became the state’s Chief Minister and the country’s Prime Minister. This is the power of the organisation.""However, he issued a clarification, saying, ""I've been saying this from the beginning: I am opposed to the ideology of the RSS. They neither respect the Constitution nor the country's laws, and it's an unregistered organisation.""""But I admire their organisational capacity because an organisation that isn't even registered has become so powerful that the Prime Minister says from the Red Fort that it is the world's largest NGO. If it's an NGO, then where have your rules and regulations gone? But I admire their organisational capacity,"" he added.Earlier this week, Singh had also praised Rahul Gandhi for his stance on socio-economic issues, giving him ""full marks"" while calling for internal reforms within the Congress. Drawing a parallel with Rahul Gandhi’s push for Election Commission reforms, Singh argued that the party itself needed similar changes.In another post on X, he wrote, ""Rahul ji you are absolutely ‘Bang On’ in matters of Socio-Economic Issues. Full Marks. But now please look at Congress also. Like Election Commission needs Reforms, So Does Indian National Congress. You have started with 'संघटन सृजन' But we need more Pragmatic Decentralised Functioning.""He added, ""I am sure you would do it because I know you can do it. Only problem is that it is not easy to ‘Convince’ you!!""Meanwhile, BJP alleged that Digvijay's praise for the organisational power of the BJP and the RSS was an ""open dissent"" against Rahul Gandhi's leadership in the party.BJP national spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi alleged that Rahul was bringing his party ""upside down"" because he had been sidelined in the party.""It's because our Narendra Modi is 'guddri ke lal' (diamond in the rough) and their leader is 'Jawahar ke lal' (great-grandson of Jawaharlal Nehru). Since our Narendra Modi has risen to top from bottom, he is taking the party (BJP) also to the top from bottom,"" Trivedi told a press conference at the BJP headquarters here.In a swipe to Rahul, he said, ""Since their leader is 'Jawahar ke lal' who is now 'side down from up', he is bringing his party upside down.""This comes after the Congress held the CWC meet in Delhi on Saturday under the chaimanship of party chief Mallikarjun Kharge -- first after the party suffered a huge loss in Bihar assembly elections.After the CWC meet, Kharge announced that the grand-old-party launch a nation-wide protest against the Centre for replacing rural employment scheme - MGNREGA - with VB G-RAM-G law from January 5.""In the meeting, we took an oath. We decided to launch a massive movement across the country, making the MNREGA scheme the central point. Indian National Congress party, taking a leading role, will launch the Save MNREGA Campaign from January 5th,"" Kharge said.","Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said that an organisation known for Godse can not teach anything to a organisation founded by Gandhi. BJP alleged that Digvijay's praise for the organisational power of the BJP and the RSS was an ""open dissent"" against Rahul Gandhi's leadership.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126212213,imgsize-908259,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"
'IO colluded with ...

NEW DELHI: The Unnao rape case victim levelled serious allegations against the investigating officer in the case saying that IO ""colluded with the judge"" to ensure that the ""other party won"". The charges came as the Delhi high court granted bail to the convict and expelled BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar and suspended his life sentence.The survivor and her mother met the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) officials on Saturday and submitted a complaint regarding the same.""The complaint is that the investigating officer has wronged me. He colluded with the judge to ensure that the other party won, so that the rape victim would lose, her courage would be broken, and she would not be able to pursue the case further,"" ANI quoted the survivor as saying.""Had the CBI stood with my lawyer, we wouldn't have had to see this day. We would have won, and they would have lost,"" she further said.The CBI has approached the Supreme Court to challenge the Delhi high court’s order staying the life sentence of former Uttar Pradesh MLA and granting him bail. The high court’s ruling sparked strong backlash from the survivor’s family and opposition parties, escalating calls for the Supreme Court to step in.Reacting to this, the survivor's mother said: ""If CBI meets us, only then will we trust them. How can we trust them otherwise? We have not discussed CBI. We have only said that the Investigating Officer met them. He was talking to Kuldeep Sengar's daughter. When we asked him whether he knew the victim, he said, 'Why would I know her?' He said this in a crowded court.""Sengar was found guilty in the Unnao rape case in December 2019 and sentenced to life imprisonment along with a Rs 25 lakh fine. Despite being granted bail in this matter, he will remain incarcerated as he is serving a separate 10-year sentence in another CBI case linked to murder.Delhi witnessed protests on Saturday over the suspension of the life sentence of Sengar, with police detaining several demonstrators near the Parliament complex. Activist Yogita Bhayana, Congress leader Mumtaz Patel and others were taken into custody after they staged a sit-in to oppose the Delhi high court’s recent order granting Sengar bail.","The Unnao rape case victim levelled serious allegations against the investigating officer in the case.

CWC Meet: Top Congress Leaders Huddle Up In Delhi, Discuss Action Against Govt On G RAM G Law

NEW DELHI: The BJP on Saturday targeted the Gandhi–Vadra family, alleging that ""their hate for Dalit is so open."" The charge from the saffron party came shortly after the Congress held a press conference in which party president Mallikarjun Kharge initially said he would not read the full note aloud and would instead circulate it to the media, before being interrupted moments later by the party's general secretary, who urged him to read it out.Sharing a clip of the exchange, BJP spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari accused the Congress leadership of disrespecting Kharge. He wrote on X, ""Be it Rahul Gandhi Priyanka Gandhi or Jairam Ramesh, their hate for a 'DALIT' is so open! Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge clearly stated that he would not read the full note and would circulate it to the press instead. Within seconds, Jairam Ramesh cut in and directed him to read it out. And Kharge ji complied. This is how Gandhi - Vadra family treats their own President!""At the press conference, the Congress announced a nationwide protest against the Centre's decision to replace the rural employment scheme MGNREGA with what it called the VB G Ram G Act.Following the Congress Working Committee meeting, Kharge said replacing a scheme named after Mahatma Gandhi amounted to an insult to the Father of the Nation.Meanwhile, leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi took the decision to scrap MGNREGA without consulting relevant ministers or even the Union Cabinet.The LoP also pledged to oppose the move, saying, ""As Kharge ji has said, we are going to resist it. We are going to fight it. And I'm confident that the entire opposition is going to be aligned against this action.""","BJP accuses Congress leadership of disrespecting Mallikarjun Kharge.
