"Wine traders accuse Karnataka mantri of graft, BJP seeks his resignation",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/wine-traders-accuse-karnataka-mantri-of-graft-bjp-seeks-his-resignation/articleshow/114997206.cms,"Wine merchants should correct themselves: Excise minister

BENGALURU: The Congress government in Karnataka is facing another huge embarrassment as state excise minister RB Timmapur is accused of corruption and bribery in his department. The Karnataka Wine Merchants' Association has accused his office of demanding Rs 16 crore in bribe from officials within the excise department.The allegations have heightened calls for accountability, with BJP calling for Timmapur's resignation amid growing concerns over corruption within the state's excise administration.In a letter to governor Thaawar Chand Gehlot, the chief secretary and the Karnataka Lokayukta, the Association outlined extensive bribery and money-laundering practices allegedly orchestrated by the minister's office, particularly concerning the transfer of excise officials in Bengaluru.However, TOI couldn't independently verify the authenticity of these allegations. According to the letter, Rs 16 crore was reportedly collected in just one day from various levels of the excise department, including deputy commissioners, superintendents, and inspectors, as their tenures came to a close.Timmapur has denied the allegations, saying, ""You must ask them why they went to pay money. Why would anyone pay if everything is in order?""The letter from the Association paints a grim picture of systemic corruption, alleging that ""huge bribes and money-laundering"" are common in the excise minister's office. It suggests that these illegal activities are aimed at facilitating illicit collection of funds for electoral purposes. Notably, the document claims that substantial sums have been extracted over the past two to three and a half years, coinciding with the conclusion of various officers' tenures.It further details that one deputy commissioner allegedly took between Rs 25 lakh and Rs 40 lakh from each officer for easy transfers, leading to a total of Rs 2.5 crore to Rs 3 crore reportedly collected from deputy commissioners operating in Bengaluru alone.Amid these allegations, minister Timmapur, who was campaigning in Shiggaon, pledged to take action against officials involved in corrupt practices. ""When these people (wine merchants) do something wrong, then they (officers) harass them. The wine merchants should correct themselves,"" he said, attempting to counter the accusations and suggesting that they may be motivated by personal grievances.Timmapur further said: ""These allegations are baseless and politically motivated. While I have approved some promotions through proper channels, I did not authorise any transfers for monetary gain. Transfers were not executed, but routine promotions were processed appropriately. The licence renewal process was conducted without undue pressure or monetary demands... Instead of making such unfounded accusations, the association should identify who actually received the payments.""Opposition leader in the assembly and senior BJP MLA, R Ashoka, alleged a wider ""Rs 700-crore liquor scam"" operating within the state. He alleged that Thimmapur is implicated in ""blatant extortion and bribery,"" linking this controversy to other scandals, including those involving the alleged Maharshi Valmiki ST Development Corporation and Muda land scams.","The Karnataka Wine Merchants' Association has accused excise minister RB Timmapur of bribery and money-laundering practices.

Failure to follow Vajpayee’s ‘road map’ led to J&K’s downgrade: Omar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/failure-to-follow-vajpayees-road-map-led-to-jks-downgrade-omar/articleshow/114990649.cms,"Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah (Pic credit: PTI)

SRINAGAR:

Jhamoriyat, Kashmiriyat aur Insaniyat

Chief minister Omar Abdullah showered fulsome praise Tuesday on “great visionary” Atal Bihari Vajpayee in the assembly while lamenting that J&K “would not have been where it is at present had the former PM’s road map” for the region been followed.Alluding to the BJP-led Centre’s 2019 abrogation of Article 370 and statehood, Omar suggested J&K wouldn’t have been downgraded if Vajpayee’s road map had been adhered to in spirit. “Unfortunately, the path shown by Vajpayee has been left mid-way and instead of connecting people, distances are being created,” National Conference (NC) vice-president and CM said on the second day of the inaugural assembly session of J&K as a Union territory (UT).Speaking during obituary references to 57 leaders who passed away in the past decade, Omar struggled to find words to eulogise the former BJP stalwart. “What should I say about the late Vajpayee. He was a towering personality who started the Lahore bus and went to Minar-e-Pakistan. He always tried to build friendly ties with Pakistan. He was the one who continuously said friends can be changed, not neighbours,” Omar said.The CM recalled Vajpayee’s slogan of “(Democracy, Kashmiri ethos and humanity)” as an example of the ex-PM’s unmatched vision. “Perhaps, he was the first and the last leader who raised this slogan,” Omar said.The CM reminisced about another instance when the J&K assembly had passed a resolution over two decades ago calling for greater autonomy, only for it to be returned by the Vajpayee-led cabinet. “But later, Vajpayee realised the decision was taken in haste. He asked the then law minister to hold talks with (then governing) NC leaders. But progress couldn’t be made further. When Vajpayee passed away, things changed drastically,” Omar said.Monday’s obituary references mentioned lawmakers from Ladakh and Kargil. Omar noted this was, perhaps, the last time the assembly was paying tributes to such members as Ladakh and Kargil were not part of Jammu and Kashmir anymore after the Aug 2019 abrogation cleaved the erstwhile state into two UTs -- Ladakh and J&K.Meanwhile, BJP’s Udhampur-East MLA RS Pathania referred to Monday’s controversial move by PDP member Waheed Para to move a resolution challenging the abrogation of Article 370, sparking bedlam in the House. Pathania demanded to know how media had covered the row when a “copy of the resolution hadn’t reached the Speaker”. Speaker Abdul Rahim Rather of NC admitted he hadn’t received the document but requested Pathania to stick to obituary references. CM Omar termed Parra’s move an attempt “to play to the gallery”.",Chief minister Omar Abdullah showered fulsome praise on “great visionary’ Atal Bihari Vajpayee in the assembly.

The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections , which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases. The results will be declared on November 23, along with Maharashtra.In the Tribal-dominated state, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and CM Hemant's Soren Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) are in a direct fight, while the Congress party and Lalu Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) are in alliance with the JMM.The JMM-Congress-RJD alliance are also reportedly seeking to deal with Left parties, Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party and other tribal outfits that have been contesting the elections in the state as independent entities and make efforts to field candidates against the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) on all 81 seats collectively.In the last assembly polls in 2019, the JMM-Congress-RJD alliance won a comfortable majority of 47 seats in a House of 81.The BJP slipped to 25 seats from 37 it held in 2014. The poor performance was perceived to be the outcome of its decision to contest alone backfiring. The party did not foster an alliance with the Ajsu in the 2019 polls when Raghubar Das, currently the Odisha governor, was serving the state as CM.In this year's Lok Sabha polls in Jharkhand, the BJP-led NDA secured nine out of the 14 seats, with the BJP winning eight and its alliance partner, the Ajsu (All Jharkhand Students Union) Party, retaining its single seat.On the other hand, the opposition India bloc improved its tally, increasing its seat count from two in 2019 to five in the parliamentary polls.BJP and JMM have spruced up their pace of campaigning from the ground zero to social media. BJP and JMM leaders are actively rebutting and challenging each other on a range of issues, including illegal immigration, youth welfare, employment and housing.INDIA bloc parties in Jharkhand slammed the EC for holding assembly elections in the state along with that of Maharashtra but claimed that they were ready to slug it out with BJP-led NDA, which has welcomed the announcement of poll dates.JMM, Congress, and CPI (ML-L) said the announcement showed that EC was in a hurry to conduct elections though the assembly tenure was due to end in January next year.Also, both the INDIA bloc and BJP-led NDA are expected to get into huddles to discuss the modalities of seat-sharing which is going to be a challenge for both the competing teams.","The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections, which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra. Elections in Maharashtra will be held in single phase on November 20. The counting of votes will be on November 23.Maharashtra is gearing up for elections as the two major political alliances—the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) and the Mahayuti—prepare to face each other for the first time in a Vidhan Sabha election.The Maha Vikas Aghadi, comprise of the Congress, the Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray), and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) under Sharad Pawar, will go head-to-head with the Mahayuti , which includes the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Shiv Sena faction led by Eknath Shinde, and the NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar. This will be the first electoral contest between these two alliances since the splits within the Shiv Sena and NCP.The MVA is hopeful of replicating its recent Lok Sabha success, while the Mahayuti aims to retain power by leveraging its populist schemes targeted at women and youth. Both alliances have set their sights on winning the state.Narayan Rane, a former Union Minister and the victor in the Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg Lok Sabha constituency, is poised to be a key figure for the BJP in the Konkan region during the forthcoming elections. Meanwhile, two constituencies are expected to be critical battlegrounds: chief minister Eknath Shinde's Kopri-Pachpakdi seat in Thane City and Worli in Mumbai, where Aaditya Thackeray, a leader of the Shiv Sena (UBT), is seeking reelection.In the last Vidhan Sabha elections in 2019, the BJP secured 26.1% of the votes, the Congress 16.1%, the NCP 16.9%, and the Shiv Sena 16.6%. The BJP and the Shiv Sena (then united) formed the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which secured a majority. However, the coalition soon crumbled due to disagreements over government formation, plunging the state into a political crisis.After no party could establish a government, Maharashtra was placed under President's rule. Devendra Fadnavis was briefly sworn in as chief minister, with Ajit Pawar as deputy chief minister. However, both resigned just days later before a scheduled floor test.By November 28, 2019, a new coalition emerged, with the Shiv Sena (Uddhav faction), NCP (Sharad Pawar faction), and Congress forming the Maha Vikas Aghadi government, led by Uddhav Thackeray as chief minister.The state's politics took another turn in June, 2022, when Uddhav Thackeray resigned following a rebellion within the Shiv Sena, led by Eknath Shinde, who then allied with the BJP. Eknath Shinde assumed the role of chief minister, with Devendra Fadnavis returning as deputy chief minister.",The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra. Elections in Maharashtra will be held in single phase on November 20. The counting of votes will be on November 23.
