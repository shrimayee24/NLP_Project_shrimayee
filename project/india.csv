That is why I consider it my duty to thank the Prime Minister.""BJP, which on its own had received 20-plus seats in the last two polls, struggled to get even 10 seats in Maharashtra this year. BJP 's vote share in Maharashtra stood at 26.18%. In contrast, Congress managed to slightly improve its performance, winning 13 seats in the state and Shiv Sena contributed nine seats.Speaking at the same press conference, Congress leader Prithviraj Chavan and Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Uddhav Thackeray, who faced a major political crisis in his party when the Shiv Sena split in 2022, declared that the doors are shut for all his former party members who abandoned his faction and joined the camp of his rival, Eknath Shinde.When asked if he would welcome back the leaders who had deserted his faction, Thackeray firmly stated, ""Absolutely not. Those who left me will not be taken back."" Sharad Pawar, when posed the same question, responded, ""There is no question of taking them back.""Regarding the acceptance of new leaders into his party, Thackeray said, ""We will move forward with all those people who stayed with us, and struggled with us.

""When three parties come together, it means everyone is together and everyone will fight together,"" he affirmed.Across the country, BJP's victory count fell short of their previous achievements.

""People were expecting Rs 8,000 into their accounts by Rahul Gandhi, on the contrary, they have been hugely burdened by petroleum products,"" he said.BJP leader BY Vijayendra said, ""Faced by defeat in Lok Sabha polls, the chief minister is not ready to accept that the financial situation of the state has deteriorated, but the hike in fuel prices proves it. The government is unable to run the administration because of guarantees, they are unable to get proper resources. The government should withdraw this decision (of fuel price hike). ""On Monday, we are going to organise protests across Karnataka,"" he added.The price surge has been linked to the state government's decision to adjust the sales tax on petroleum products, according to the Petroleum Dealers Association.

He also alleged that the Congress government ordered the commission of inquiry with a clear political motive and also to discredit the earlier govt.“An inquiry of this nature expects the chairman to show and practice neutrality and bring out the truth after examining the issues from different angles. After such an exercise, the report ought to be submitted to responsible persons. But I am constrained to observe that your way of functioning is contrary to the well enunciated principles and processes. It is very clear that you have formed a predetermined opinion that mistakes were committed and it is indicative of your biased view that could be reflected in the final report. It is as if you have determined that a mistake has been committed and now all it remained to calculate the extent of financial loss as per your statements,” KCR said in his letter to the inquiry commission on Saturday.He said “it is as if you are delivering the judgement even before conducting the inquiry and it does not behave the stature of a retired Chief Justice of the Patna High Court. An inescapable conclusion after considering all these facts, is the futility of deposing anything before this commission of inquiry. Hence considering all these facts, I humbly request you to recuse yourself from the responsibilities of heading the commission of inquiry,” the former CM said.The inquiry commission was constituted by the Congress govt in March this year under the Commission of Inquiry Act, 1952 to probe into power purchase agreements (PPA) entered during BRS govt period and also Yadadri and Bhadradri power plants, served notices on the former chief minister to clarity on power purchase agreement with Chattisgarh govt and construction of power plants especially Yadadri which was given on nomination basis.Though the ex-CM asked time till the end of July to submit his argument to the commission, the inquiry commission asked him to submit his oral or written argument or clarification before June 15.

slams BJP-Ajit Pawar tie-up

NCP's claims ignored

The corruption tag

Waiting for Rajya Sabha boost

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra is one of the key states which helped the opposition puncture Prime Minister Modi's claims of ""abki baar, 400 paar"" in the just-concluded Lok Sabha elections. The BJP ended up with just 9 seats, which is less than half of 23, the number of seats it had won in the state 5 years ago. Unfortunately BJP's ""engineered"" allies also failed to contribute to the NDA target.While the split Sena, now the actual Shiv Sena, performed reasonably well, the split NCP, now the official NCP - stares at a tense future. According to news agency IANS, BJP is conducting an internal survey to assess the possibilities of contesting the upcoming assembly elections aloneNCP chief and Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, who had rebelled against his uncle Sharad Pawar and walked out of the party with most of the MLAs and MPs, finds himself in the wilderness after a disastrous showing in Lok Sabha polls. Ajit Pawar 's NCP contested 4 Lok Sabha seats and managed to win only one. Contrast this to the performance of Eknath Shinde , who had rebelled against Uddhav Thackeray, split the Shiv Sena, joined hands with the BJP and went on to become the chief minister of Maharashtra. Shinde's Sena contested 15 seats and won 7 with a strike rate better than the BJP.What's worse - the RSS has come out in the open questioning BJP's wisdom in joining hands with Ajit Pawar. An article in ""Organiser"" magazine, which is linked to the RSS, slammed BJP's move and called it ""unnecessary politicking."" It said the induction of Ajit Pawar's NCP into NDA had reduced the brand value of BJP.""Maharashtra is a prime example of unnecessary politicking and avoidable manipulations. NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar joined BJP though BJP and split SS (Shiv Sena) had a comfortable majority. Sharad Pawar would have faded away in two-three years as NCP would have lost energy with infighting between cousins,"" RSS lifelong member Ratan Sharda said in the article.""Why was this ill-advised step taken? BJP supporters were hurt because they had fought against this Congress ideology for years and were persecuted. In a single stroke, BJP reduced its brand value. After years of struggle to become numero uno in Maharashtra, it became just another political party without any difference,"" he added.The NCP leaders have tried to play down the criticism calling it the personal opinion of the RSS leader. They claim that their alliance with BJP would continue. But the party's reduced bargaining power post elections was evident when PM Modi formed his council of ministers.The NCP is one of the allies who does not have a minister in Modi 3.0. When the contours of the NDA government was being discussed, NCP was the first party to go public with its disappointment over portfolio allocation. Ajit Pawar's party refused to accept minister of state with independent charge post that was being offered for its leader Parful Patel. Pawar said it was a conscious decision taken unanimously as Praful Patel had been a Cabinet minister at the Centre earlier and the offered post would be demotion for him.""I was earlier a Cabinet minister in the Union government, so this will be a demotion for me. We have informed the BJP leadership and they have already told us to just wait a few days, they will take remedial measures,"" Patel had then told reporters.BJP's decision to take Ajit Pawar on board also gave the opposition an opportunity to mock PM Modi over his much-talked about crusade against corruption. This was because the Prime Minister and top BJP leaders had in their earlier rallies accused Ajit Pawar of corruption in the state's irrigation scam.Marginalised after Lok Sabha polls, Ajit Pawar now appears to be waiting for the Rajya Sabha boost to make bigger claims within the NDA. With bulk of NCP MLAs with him, Ajit Pawar will see an increase in the party's tally of MPs in the Upper House. He has already fielded his wife Sunetra Pawar, who had lost Lok Sabha elections to Sharad Pawar's daughter Supriya Sule in Baramati, as NCP candidate for Rajya Sabha elections.Clearly, as BJP now gears up for the assembly elections in the state due later this year, Ajit Pawar may face testing times ahead. Shinde has proved that he will be more valuable as a partner to the saffron party than Ajit Pawar.(With inputs from agencies)",NCP chief and Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar finds himself in the wilderness after a disastrous showing in Lok Sabha polls.
