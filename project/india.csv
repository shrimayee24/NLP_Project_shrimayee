NEW DELHI: The Speaker of the 18th Lok Sabha is likely to be elected on June 26 but speculation over who will be the candidate of the ruling alliance shows no signs of abating.Days after the opposition INDIA bloc insisted that the Lok Sabha Speaker 's post must be allocated to the 'kingmakers' of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) -- the Janata Dal (United) and the Telugu Desam Party -- different opinions have cropped up in the BJP-led bloc.The BJP won 240 Lok Sabha seats – 32 short of the majority mark. With 16 and 12 Lok Sabha seats respectively, N Chandrababu Naidu's TDP and Nitish Kumar's JD(U) emerged as the kingmakers, becoming indispensable for the formation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's third government.While the JD(U) has said it will back the BJP's pick for the Speaker post, the TDP suggested that the partners of the ruling alliance must finalise a consensus candidate.""The NDA partners will sit together and decide who our candidate for the Speaker is going to be. Once a consensus is reached, we will field that candidate and all partners, including the TDP, will support the candidate,"" TDP national spokesperson Pattabhi Ram Kommareddy said.The contest for the position as of now seems to be between Daggubati Purandeswari, the BJP's Andhra Pradesh president, and GM Harish Balayogi, a first-time TDP MP from the Amalapuram constituency. Both are considered strong contenders for the post.The of the Speaker is crucial as it will determine how the Lok Sabha functions.Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut on Sunday said all partners of the opposition INDIA bloc would ensure support for the TDP if it fields a candidate for the Lok Sabha Speaker's election. Raut said the Lok Sabha Speaker's election is crucial and alleged that if the BJP gets the post, it will break the TDP, JD(U) and the political outfits of Chirag Paswan and Jayant Chaudhary.""We have the experience that BJP betrays the people who support it,"" Raut said, adding: ""I hear the TDP wants to field its candidate. If that happens, INDIA bloc partners will discuss the issue and we will try to ensure that all the INDIA alliance partners extend support to the TDP.""Senior Congress leader Ashok Gehlot also claimed that if the BJP gets the Speaker's post, it would start horse-trading of JD(U) and TDP MPs.Raut further said that the the opposition should get the deputy Speaker's post as per rule.INDIA bloc has expressed its intention to field its own candidate for the Speaker position, but political commenters suggested that the opposition alliance may step back from the post if the position of deputy Speaker is given.The deputy Speaker's post has been vacant for the past five years, and the opposition hopes that this time it will be filled. Historically, the deputy Speaker's post has been filled by opposition parties, which strengthens democratic norms and ensures the continuity of the Speaker's officeThe Speaker has significant powers, including the ability to decide when a question can be asked, expunge remarks of MPs, disqualify or suspend members, and pass Bills based on voice votes.

Dhankhar inaugurates 'Prerna Sthal' in Parliament complex; Congress slams relocation of statues as 'unilateral' move,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dhankhar-inaugurates-prerna-sthal-in-parliament-complex-congress-slams-relocation-of-statues-as-unilateral-move/articleshow/111041458.cms,"Previously situated statues were protest points inside Parliament

Relocation decision unilateral, violates the basic spirit of our democracy: Congress

Held discussions with stakeholders: LS speaker on relocation

NEW DELHI: Rajya Sabha chairperson and vice president Jagdeep Dhankhar on Sunday inaugurated the 'Prerna Sthal' in the Parliament complex. This newly established site now hosts statues of national icons and freedom fighters that were previously scattered across the premises.Dhankhar stated that the 'Prerna Sthal' aims to inspire and motivate people. This comes amidst the Congress party's criticism over the relocation of the statues from their original spots.""Imagine the contribution of these great personalities in the history of India. In which period were these great people remembered? I saw such a situation in the Central Hall. I became an MP in 1989, after that the change happened continuously,"" he said, seemingly alluding to the era of coalition governments at the Centre.The event was attended by Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, Rajya Sabha deputy chairman Harivansh, Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju, and his deputies Arjun Ram Meghwal and L Murugan. Information and broadcasting and railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw was also in attendance.The statues of Mahatma Gandhi and Ambedkar, previously situated at prominent locations within the Parliament premises, were often gathering points for opposition protests against the government.Previously, the outer lawns of Parliament housed statues of various national icons such as Ambedkar, Mahatma Gandhi, Mahatma Jyotiba Phule, Chhatrapati Shivaji, Maharana Pratap, Hemu Kalani, Mahatma Basaveshwara, Kittur Rani Channamma, Motilal Nehru, Maharaj Ranjit Singh, Durga Malla, Birsa Munda, Rajarshi Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj, and Chaudhary Devi Lal.These statues have now been relocated to the newly created enclosure at the 'Prerna Sthal.'Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said that the purpose behind the relocation and its grandiose naming was to ensure the statues of Mahatma Gandhi and Dr. Ambedkar were not placed conspicuously in front of Parliament House, where MPs could hold peaceful democratic protests as needed.Congress accused the govt of making the decision without any consultation and said that it violates the essence of democracy. There are around 50 such statues or busts throughout the Parliament House.Releasing a statement on X, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge said that previously, the statues of Mahatma Gandhi and Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar were thoughtfully placed in prominent spots. These locations, he said, were chosen after careful deliberation.""The statue of Mahatma Gandhi in a meditative posture located right in front of old Parliament building held immense significance for India’s democratic polity. Members paid their respects at the statue of Mahatma Gandhi imbibing within themselves the spirit of Mahatma. It is at this place that members often conducted peaceful and democratic protests, drawing strength from their presence,"" wrote Kharge.Kharge said that even the statue of Ambedkar had been placed at a vantage point conveying the powerful message that he is extolling the generations of parliamentarians to steadfastly hold on to values and principles enshrined in the Constitution of India. ""Incidentally, during my student days in mid 60s, I was in the forefront demanding for installation of statue of Babasaheb in the precincts of the Parliament House,"" he further wrote. ""All this has now been brought to a naught in an arbitrary and unilateral manner.”Congress said that there is a designated committee known as the 'Committee on the Installation of Portraits and Statues of National Leaders and Parliamentarians in the Parliament House Complex.' This committee includes MPs from both Houses. However, this committee has not been reconstituted since 2019.""Such decisions made without any proper discussion and deliberation with relevant stakeholders are against the rules and traditions of our Parliament,"" added Kharge.Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla said that the change came after discussions with various stakeholders, adding that the statues’ relocation is part of a broader effort to enhance the landscaping and beautification of the premises.Addressing the media, Birla said that the relocation involved continuous discussions with different stakeholders. He noted that this decision falls under the responsibilities of the Lok Sabha Speaker.""None of the statues have been removed, they have been relocated. There is no need to indulge in politics on this,"" Birla stated in response to opposition criticism regarding the move.He added, ""From time to time, I have been discussing these issues with different stakeholders. People were of the view that having these statues at one place will help disseminate information about their lives and achievements in a better way.""",Rajya Sabha chairperson Jagdeep Dhankhar on Sunday inaugurated the 'Prerna Sthal' in the Parliament complex.

It will be followed by meetings with functionaries of states that will go for assembly elections in coming months.

Sources said Congress will effect an organisational reshuffle in AICC and state units after the string of meetings where the role of party chiefs and managers will also be assessed. Of special concern is the sub-par performance in Karnataka and Telangana, where the party recently came to office with a solid performance, and Himachal Pradesh, where the party won a good majority but failed to win any of the four seats in the parliamentary elections. The party also performed poorly in Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Delhi, Uttarakhand, Andhra Pradesh and Jammu, in a repeat of 2014 and 2019 polls.

The review is likely to start later this month. The issue came up for discussion in the recent CWC meeting held to discuss the 2024 election results. The party also wants to quickly finalise the strategy for Haryana, Maharashtra and Jharkhand, which will go for assembly elections in the coming months.

Party sources said J&K may go for polls later, and it is crucial that the unit readies itself on the difficult turf.

We have issued notice to mid-day newspaper under sections 499, 505 of the Indian Penal Code for defamation and spreading false news,"" Suryavanshi said in a press conference on Sunday.As per Vanrai police in the city, Waikar's brother-in-law Mangesh Pandilkar was booked on Wednesday under IPC section 188 (disobeying official order) for allegedly using a mobile phone at a counting centre in Goregaon on June 4, when results of the general elections were announced.Speaking at the press conference, Suryavanshi said the personal mobile phone of one Dinesh Gurav, the data entry operator of Jogeshwari assembly constituency, was found in the hands of an unauthorised person and action is being taken in this regard.","Eknath Shinde wondered if doubts were being raised over EVM's sanctity in connection with the Mumbai North West constituency. He was responding to a report about a relative of Sena's Ravindra Waikar, who defeated Shiv Sena (UBT)'s Amol Kirtikar by just 48 seats from the seat.

slams BJP-Ajit Pawar tie-up

NCP's claims ignored

The corruption tag

Waiting for Rajya Sabha boost

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra is one of the key states which helped the opposition puncture Prime Minister Modi's claims of ""abki baar, 400 paar"" in the just-concluded Lok Sabha elections. The BJP ended up with just 9 seats, which is less than half of 23, the number of seats it had won in the state 5 years ago. Unfortunately BJP's ""engineered"" allies also failed to contribute to the NDA target.While the split Sena, now the actual Shiv Sena, performed reasonably well, the split NCP, now the official NCP - stares at a tense future. According to news agency IANS, BJP is conducting an internal survey to assess the possibilities of contesting the upcoming assembly elections aloneNCP chief and Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, who had rebelled against his uncle Sharad Pawar and walked out of the party with most of the MLAs and MPs, finds himself in the wilderness after a disastrous showing in Lok Sabha polls. Ajit Pawar 's NCP contested 4 Lok Sabha seats and managed to win only one. Contrast this to the performance of Eknath Shinde , who had rebelled against Uddhav Thackeray, split the Shiv Sena, joined hands with the BJP and went on to become the chief minister of Maharashtra. Shinde's Sena contested 15 seats and won 7 with a strike rate better than the BJP.What's worse - the RSS has come out in the open questioning BJP's wisdom in joining hands with Ajit Pawar. An article in ""Organiser"" magazine, which is linked to the RSS, slammed BJP's move and called it ""unnecessary politicking."" It said the induction of Ajit Pawar's NCP into NDA had reduced the brand value of BJP.""Maharashtra is a prime example of unnecessary politicking and avoidable manipulations. NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar joined BJP though BJP and split SS (Shiv Sena) had a comfortable majority. Sharad Pawar would have faded away in two-three years as NCP would have lost energy with infighting between cousins,"" RSS lifelong member Ratan Sharda said in the article.""Why was this ill-advised step taken? BJP supporters were hurt because they had fought against this Congress ideology for years and were persecuted. In a single stroke, BJP reduced its brand value. After years of struggle to become numero uno in Maharashtra, it became just another political party without any difference,"" he added.The NCP leaders have tried to play down the criticism calling it the personal opinion of the RSS leader. They claim that their alliance with BJP would continue. But the party's reduced bargaining power post elections was evident when PM Modi formed his council of ministers.The NCP is one of the allies who does not have a minister in Modi 3.0. When the contours of the NDA government was being discussed, NCP was the first party to go public with its disappointment over portfolio allocation. Ajit Pawar's party refused to accept minister of state with independent charge post that was being offered for its leader Parful Patel. Pawar said it was a conscious decision taken unanimously as Praful Patel had been a Cabinet minister at the Centre earlier and the offered post would be demotion for him.""I was earlier a Cabinet minister in the Union government, so this will be a demotion for me. We have informed the BJP leadership and they have already told us to just wait a few days, they will take remedial measures,"" Patel had then told reporters.BJP's decision to take Ajit Pawar on board also gave the opposition an opportunity to mock PM Modi over his much-talked about crusade against corruption. This was because the Prime Minister and top BJP leaders had in their earlier rallies accused Ajit Pawar of corruption in the state's irrigation scam.Marginalised after Lok Sabha polls, Ajit Pawar now appears to be waiting for the Rajya Sabha boost to make bigger claims within the NDA. With bulk of NCP MLAs with him, Ajit Pawar will see an increase in the party's tally of MPs in the Upper House. He has already fielded his wife Sunetra Pawar, who had lost Lok Sabha elections to Sharad Pawar's daughter Supriya Sule in Baramati, as NCP candidate for Rajya Sabha elections.Clearly, as BJP now gears up for the assembly elections in the state due later this year, Ajit Pawar may face testing times ahead. Shinde has proved that he will be more valuable as a partner to the saffron party than Ajit Pawar.(With inputs from agencies)",NCP chief and Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar finds himself in the wilderness after a disastrous showing in Lok Sabha polls.

Swara Bhasker Condemns CISF Constable's Assault on Kangana Ranaut: 'But at least she is alive, and has her security around...'

CHANDIGARH: More than a week after newly elected MP from Mandi Kangana Ranaut was allegedly slapped by a CISF woman constable at Chandigarh airport, a Sikh cop with UT police faced the wrath of locals and Himachal Police at Dalhousie in HP over the slapping incident .ASI Paramjit Singh, who had gone to Dalhousie to enjoy a vacation with his family, firstly encountered taunts from locals who allegedly commented, “You hit our MP at the airport in your state and now expect us to welcome you here.” The matter turned uglier when a constable with Himachal Police also allegedly misbehaved with the UT cop.An ASI with HP police also supported the locals and did not listen to Paramjit. After the incident, Paramjit returned to the city the same day and filed a complaint with the DGP of HP Police via an email against the cops who allegedly misbehaved with him.In his complaint to the HP DGP, ASI Paramjit said he had gone to Khajjiar near Dalhousie for 2-day vacation in his personal car on June 9. Paramjit said he parked his car at Khajjiar where already other taxis and cars were also parked. Later, he sent his son to bring spectacles from his car, who later called him on his phone and said the local people were objecting to his parking the car at the current spot.Paramjit said other cars were also parked in the area, but nobody listened to him and locals started quarreling with him. The locals allegedly were angry over the slapping incident involving BJP MP Kangana Ranaut at Chandigarh airport. Later, one constable of Himachal Police also reached the spot and started arguing with Paramjit and told him to park his car somewhere else. When Paramjit moved his car from there, ASI-ranked cop Madan Paul of HP Police also reached there and started arguing with him, saying that he was driving in a wrong lane. The constable also tried to pull out his car keys, but Paramjit rolled up his windows to stop the cop.Later, ASI Madan Paul left the spot and other locals reached there and started quarreling with him and kept saying that “you people had slapped our woman at your area,” the UT cop said. Paramjit alleged that both the ASI and constable of Himachal police were not ready to listen to him and supported the locals without knowing the facts.The Himachal policemen also misbehaved with him in front of his family despite knowing that he was also from Chandigarh police, Paramjit claimed. The ASI also hit his hand when Paramjit was trying to record the act on his mobile phone. In the process, his phone fell on the ground and got switched off, the UT cop alleged.After this incident, Paramjit cut short his two-day vacation plan in Dalhousie and returned home on the same day. Paramjit Singh said he and his family members are somewhat in shock since the incident occurred.No response has been received from Himachal Police so far on his complaint, ASI Paramjit Singh said.",ASI Paramjit Singh had gone to Dalhousie to enjoy a vacation with his family.

BJP has also planned to hold a protest against the petrol price increase on Monday.The Karnataka government announced a hike in petrol and diesel prices by Rs 3 per litre and Rs 3.02 per litre respectively, effective immediately, garnering strong reactions and concerns from opposition leaders and residents.BJP Spokesperson S Prakash called out the Siddaramaiah-led Congress government for substantially raising petrol prices in the state immediately after the parliamentary elections concluded. ""People were expecting Rs 8,000 into their accounts by Rahul Gandhi, on the contrary, they have been hugely burdened by petroleum products,"" he said.BJP leader BY Vijayendra said, ""Faced by defeat in Lok Sabha polls, the chief minister is not ready to accept that the financial situation of the state has deteriorated, but the hike in fuel prices proves it. The government is unable to run the administration because of guarantees, they are unable to get proper resources. The government should withdraw this decision (of fuel price hike). ""On Monday, we are going to organise protests across Karnataka,"" he added.The price surge has been linked to the state government's decision to adjust the sales tax on petroleum products, according to the Petroleum Dealers Association.

Delhi water crisis: Atishi alleges BJP sabotage; wants police protection for pipelines,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhi-water-crisis-atishi-alleges-bjp-sabotage-wants-police-protection-for-pipelines/articleshow/111047822.cms,"NEW DELHI: Delhi water minister Atishi wrote to police commissioner Sanjay Arora on Sunday, requesting deployment of personnel for protection of major pipelines for the next 15 days as a Delhi Jal Board patrol team had found signs of sabotage at several spots of the water network.Later in the day at a press conference, the minister alleged the possibility of BJP's hand in the damage to the pipelines.Atishi's letter to the police commissioner said that production of treated water had reduced by about ""70 MGD"".She wrote that Delhi Jal Board had deployed patrol teams to check the main distribution network that carries raw water to the treatment plants, and from there to the main underground reservoirs in different parts of the city. ""In addition, we have deployed teams under the supervision of ADMs to support this work,"" she wrote.The minister said that on Saturday, DJB's patrol team found a major leakage in the main pipeline that carries water from the Sonia Vihar treatment plant to south Delhi. ""This (the leak) was near the DTL substation in Garhi Medhu. Our patrolling team found that several large 375 mm bolts and one 12-inch bolt had been cut from the pipeline, causing leakage. The fact that several large bolts had been cut seems to indicate foul play and sabotage,"" the letter said.Atishi requested Arora to deploy police personnel to prevent ""miscreants or people with ulterior motives"" from ""tampering with the water pipelines "".About the damaged pipeline, she mentioned that a team worked for six hours and repaired the leak. ""But this meant that we had to stop pumping water for 6 hours, and 20 MGD was not pumped during this time. As a consequence, a further 25% of water shortage will be experienced in south Delhi,"" she added.Minister Saurabh Bharadwaj mentioned that several areas in south Delhi such as Greater Kailash, Kalkaji and Chirag Delhi, had got less water because the Sonia Vihar pipeline had been tampered with. ""There are plates to join the pipelines and bolts to clamp the plate. Some miscreants had cut them, leading to the leakage. For repairs, the line had to be shut down,"" he said in a video message.Bharadwaj denied claims that the leaks were not being addressed. He said miscreants were deliberately damaging the pipelines and then making videos to defame Delhi govt.At her news conference, Atishi wondered aloud how BJP functionaries had reached the broken pipelines. ""They click photos. Yesterday, the pipeline that supplies water to south Delhi from Sonia Vihar was found broken. Was this pipeline broken intentionally This would not have happened on its own. This is also a part of the conspiracy,"" she said.Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva said that it was regrettable that instead of working to fix leaks in pipelines and check water theft, Atishi was trying put blame BJP. ""Tomorrow BJP workers will hold protests across the city in 52 places against Kejriwal govt's failure to check leaks and water theft,"" he said.Later on Sunday, AAP MLA Dilip Pandey, along with his supporters, reached the residence of Union water minister CR Patil, demanding his intervention. ""We have written to Union water minister CR Patil, asking him to intervene and solve the problem. Today, we came to meet him regarding the matter. Although we did not meet him, we have given him the letter through his office,"" he said.BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said the AAP MLAs were refusing to follow Atishi's order that MLAs should go to Patil's home. ""Hardly 8 MLAs turned up outside his house, forcing AAP to abandon its agitation,"" he said.","Delhi Jal Board patrol team found signs of sabotage at several spots of the water network.
