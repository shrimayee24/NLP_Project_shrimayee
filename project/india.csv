SRINAGAR: Ladakh lieutenant governor Kavinder Gupta Saturday promised strict action against those who had defaced the national emblem on a plaque placed inside Srinagar's revered Hazratbal shrine on Friday, while J&K CM Omar Abdullah said ""the plaque should not have been placed inside the shrine"".Gupta's social media post that he was ""deeply anguished"" by the ""vandalism"" came after Omar said the emblem is used for govt functions, not at religious places. Jammu and Kashmir LG Manoj Sinha, who heads law and order has not issued any statement on the issue so far.Jammu and Kashmir's governing NC demanded that Waqf Board chairperson Darakhshan Andrabi be sacked and that they would ask the Assembly to constitute a House committee to probe alleged bungling in the Waqf Board from 2022, when the minority affairs ministry had appointed the BJP politician (Andrabi) as waqf board chairperson.On Saturday evening, NC legislators held a press conference at the party headquarters where they accused Andrabi of ""planting the crisis in Kashmir"" to help her party win polls in Bihar. NC legislator Tanvir Sadiq said J&K police have filed an open FIR in the case. ""I'm hopeful that it is against Darakhshan Andrabi for violating the Constitution regarding placing the national emblem,"" Sadiq said. NC legislators Salman Sagar said BJP has deliberately appointed a BJP politician as waqf chairperson to ""control our religious places. ""BJP's J&K unit backed Andrabi as party spokesperson Altaf Thakur linked those involved in defacing the emblem with Osama bin Laden.

'Only Mistake I Made Was...': Prajwal Revanna Tells Court Before Life Sentence In Rape Case

Poll Do you think protests will effectively change the political situation in Punjab? Yes No

PATIALA: AAP MLA Harmeet Singh Pathanmajra has allegedly escaped police custody while being taken to a local police station after his arrest.According to Punjab Police sources, Pathanmajra and his accomplices fired at police officers during the escape and even ran over one personnel, leaving him injured.According to reports, Pathanmajra and his accomplices ran over police personnel with an SUV.The Sanour MLA was arrested a day after publicly criticising his party’s Delhi leadership.His detention in Patiala was linked to a rape case filed against him, sparking political uproar in the region.In a social media post, Pathanmajra claimed the case related to his former wife and alleged that the fresh charges of rape were politically motivated.“I was booked because I raised my voice against my own government, especially the Delhi leadership,” he wrote.His brother, Hardev Singh, said the MLA was taken into custody under Section 376 of the IPC despite already having been granted bail by the Punjab and Haryana High Court. “He was arrested from Dabri in Haryana in a case where bail was already granted. This is clearly an attempt to silence him,” he alleged.CIA Patiala confirmed that three weapons have been recovered and one accomplice of MLA Pathanmajra has been arrested.The arrested individual has been identified as Balwinder Singh, while the search for MLA Pathanmajra continues.Police said two officers were injured when stones were thrown at them during the MLA’s escape attempt.Authorities added that supporters of the MLA not only pelted stones but also opened fire at the police team.Before his arrest, Pathanmajra had appealed to colleagues and supporters via Facebook to protest outside the Patiala SSP’s office at the Mini Secretariat. He urged people to reach “in tractors, trolleys, and cars” to demand his release. “I will not be silenced even if more cases are registered against me. Will AAP’s Delhi leadership rule Punjabis now? Even Congress and BJP did not interfere to this extent,” he said.The MLA has repeatedly accused the party’s central leadership of sidelining Punjab leaders and “remote-controlling” the state. Recently, he criticised officials of the Irrigation Department over flood relief efforts in his constituency. Soon after, his security cover was withdrawn and police officers in the area were reshuffled — moves that raised eyebrows.“This is retaliation. They looted Punjab more than Abdali. Now they want to sell Punjab,” Pathanmajra declared.","Harmeet Singh Pathanmajra allegedly escaped police custody while being taken to a local police station after his arrest.
