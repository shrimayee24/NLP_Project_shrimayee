'Not much scope ...': Why Congress said 'no' to alliance with Arvind Kejriwal's AAP in Haryana,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/not-much-scope-why-congress-said-no-to-alliance-with-arvind-kejriwals-aap-in-haryana/articleshow/111494075.cms,"Haryana faceoff

Failed experiment

First Mamata, now Kejriwal

No pan-India formula for INDIA bloc

United at Centre, divided in states

NEW DELHI: The Congress has formally announced the end of its uneasy and unsuccessful alliance with Arvind Kejriwal 's Aam Aadmi Party. The two parties, which had joined hands for Lok Sabha elections in Delhi, Haryana, Gujarat and Goa as part of opposition's INDIA bloc , will now faceoff as rivals in upcoming assembly elections.""There does not appear to be much scope for an alliance between the Congress and the AAP for the assembly polls in Haryana and Delhi but the INDIA bloc will fight elections together in Maharashtra and Jharkhand,"" Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh said on Thursday.AAP had already announced a month back that it will not extend its alliance with the grand old party in the assembly elections.The first fallout of this political separation will be felt in Haryana, which goes to polls later this year. The Congress fancies its chances in the state elections after an impressive performance in the Lok Sabha polls. The grand old party, which could not open its account in 2019, won five out of the 10 Lok Sabha seats in the state with a vote share of 43.67%. The Congress managed to severely dent the BJP , which could win only 5 seats - half of its 2019 tally, despite a change in state leadership and a higher voteshare of 46.1%. Kejriwal's AAP, with 3.94% of voteshare, was a distant third in the state in the national elections.In the 2019 assembly elections, the Congress had put up an impressive show winning 31 out of 90 seats with a vote share of 28.08%. This was more than double its 2014 tally of 15 assembly seats. The BJP, on the other hand, could not manage to win majority on its own and managed only 40 assembly seats with a vote share of 36.49%. In 2014 assembly elections, the BJP had won 47 seats. The Aam Aadmi Party could not win any seat in 2019 and managed only .48% of vote share in the state.The Congress, which has seen its performace improve in the state since the last assembly elections, is perhaps confident of further gains and does not want to accommodate Kejriwal's party. Aam Aadmi Party’s Haryana unit has already drawn a 90-day roadmap for an aggressive promotion of party's achievements in Punjab and Delhi in all the 90 constituencies of the state. The BJP, on the other hand, will hope that a divided opposition will help it regain some lost ground in the upcoming assembly elections.The short-lived Congress-AAP alliance failed to make any impact in Lok Sabha elections. In Delhi, the two parties could not even open their account. They failed to prevent third consecutive clean sweep by the BJP which won all the 7 seats in the national capital. The Congress went ahead with the alliance despite a very strong opposition from its state leaders and in the process even lost some of them to the BJP. In other states also where the two parties contested together there was not much of gains. On the contrary, in Punjab, where the two parties decided to contest as rivals, Congress won 7 seats out of 13 and the AAP managed 3. This despite the fact that AAP has a government in Punjab and its chief minister Bhagwant Mann had all along claimed that it will sweep out the Congress in the state.For the Congress, strong regional leaders present both an opportunity and also a challenge. In Lok Sabha elections, the Congress successfully aligned with the likes of Akhilesh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh, MK Stalin in Tamil Nadu, Tejashwi Yadav in Bihar and Hemant Soren in Jharkhand. However, the grand old party failed to join hands with Mamata Banerjee in West Bengal. In fact, the two parties engaged in open war of words through the elections. Mamata fought the elections alone and defeated not just the BJP but also decimated the Congress. Kejriwal will be second key leader of INDIA bloc with whom the Congress has now refused to stich an alliance. Both Congress and AAP, which has gained the status of a national party, have high stakes in assembly elections and feel going solo will be more beneficial for them.The Congress today made it clear that alliances in states under the INDIA banner would be on a case-to-case basis and there will be no one formula for tie-up. Where state Congress leaders and the respective alliance parties agree, there will be an alliance, the grand old party said outlining the principle for future tie-ups. ""In states where the circumstances are such that our leaders of the state and leaders of our alliance partners want, the alliance will remain. In Maharashtra, the alliance will be there with Shiv Sena (UBT) and NCP (SCP). In Jharkhand, we have an alliance with the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha,"" Jairam Ramesh said.The internal contradictions of the INDIA bloc are already in display in states like West Bengal, Kerala and Punjab - where Congress is a political rival of its national alliance partners. All these states have seen the INDIA bloc partners attack and target each other - giving fodder to the BJP which has all-along called the INDIA bloc an opportunistic alliance.","The Congress has formally announced the end of its uneasy and unsuccessful alliance with Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party. The two parties had joined hands for Lok Sabha elections in Delhi, Haryana, Gujarat and Goa as part of opposition's INDIA bloc.

However there is a risk he could lose his seat, becoming the first serving PM to lose a general election and his seat at the same time.In 2019, Sunak (44) won the Richmond and Northallerton seat with a majority of 27,210 and 63% of the vote.Political consultancy electoral calculus gives the Tories a 50% chance of holding onto the seat and Labour a 47% chance of gaining it.No incumbent prime minister has ever lost their seat at a UK general election.There is speculation Sunak may return to working in the financial sector, whether or not he stays on as MP, and spend more time in California, where he has a home. Sunak has flatly denied he plans to quit as MP and move to California if he wins his seat but loses the election and vowed to continue to represent his Yorkshire constituents. If the Tories are the second-largest party Sunak will be leader of the opposition.A major survey for the Daily Telegraph by Savanta and Electoral Calculus last month suggested the Conservatives would be reduced to just 53 seats, their worse result in modern history, and Sunak himself would lose his constituency, which he has held since 2015 and where he is known as the “Maharajah of the Yorkshire Dales”.The study projects a gigantic 382-seat majority for Labour, with Labour winning a staggering 516 constituencies.A leadership election is likely to take place within the party even if Sunak keeps his seat. Priti Patel, Boris Johnson, David Cameron, Kemi Badenoch, and Suella Braverman are among those expected to stand. But Braverman and Patel are also in tight races for their seats.Three Indian-origin MPs, Shailesh Vara and Gagan Mohindra, both Tories, as well as Labour’s Thangam Debbonaire, are predicted to lose their seats at this election, according to Electoral Calculus.Other big Tory names whose seats are vulnerable include Jeremy Hunt, Liz Truss, James Cleverly and Penny Mordaunt.Pro-India Tory MPs Bob Blackman and Theresa Villiers who have consistently defended India in the House of Commons are also forecast to lose their seats.","UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is expected to stay on as a backbench MP if his party does not win the general election.

However, traffic police cleared the site allowing the restoration of vehicle movement smoothly in a few minutes.According to BMC the flyover which is currently under the civic body fostered maintenance was constructed by the Public Works Maintenance (PWD) along with the contractor on a Build and Operate basis. The appointed contractor after constructing the flyover was to operate commercial spaces like shops, and offices below it. “This failed to take off and the matter is currently under litigation. The BMC maintains the flyover and a portion of the structure below it which fell fortunately did not injure any person. We have already begun works of removing any loose parts around the crashed structure,” said a civic official.It has also been learned that the BMC had proposed repairs to the flyover and structural strengthening of the structure.

Keir Starmer is on the brink of becoming the next prime minister of Britain on Friday, as his Labour Party is projected to achieve a landslide victory in the UK election.The Conservatives, led by Rishi Sunak , are expected to suffer unprecedented losses. According to predictions, the centre-left Labour Party is set to secure an impressive 410 out of the 650 parliamentary seats, representing a significant comeback from their abysmal result five years ago, which was their worst performance since 1935.Should the exit polls prove to be correct, the Labour party would hold a commanding majority of 170 seats, indicating the conclusion of a 14-year era of Conservative-led government in the United Kingdom.The outgoing House of Commons featured 15 MPs of Indian origin, and this number is anticipated to rise. In the UK General Election 2024, a total of 107 British-Indian candidates are vying for the 680 available seats.Here are the British Indians who won:Shivani Raja has won Leicester East gaining the seat from Labour party. The fight in Leicester East had a host of heavyweights in the fight including former MPs Claude Webbe and Keith Vaz who contested as Independents. Shivani Raja, a Leicester-born who studied in the city at Herrick Primary, Soar Valley College, Wyggeston and Queen Elizabeth II college. She also graduated with First Class Honours in Cosmetic Science from De Montfort University (DMU).Former Welsh Sec Alun Cairns loses out to Labour's Kanishka Narayan, of Indian origin who becomes Wales' first MP from a minority ethnic background. Narayan was born in India and moved to Cardiff when he was 12. He got into Eton on a scholarship, went on to study at Oxford and then Stanford before becoming a civil servant.Indian-origin Suella Braverman has won the Fareham and Waterlooville seat.Braverman was replaced by James Cleverly as interior minister in the last re-shuffle of the last Sunak cabinet. She had courted controversy after suggesting that the Metropolitan Police were too lenient with pro-Palestine protesters.","Labour Party is projected to achieve a landslide victory in the UK election.

"Nigel Farage’s Reform UK secures first-ever Parliamentary seat, marks major shift in British politics",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/nigel-farages-reform-uk-secures-first-ever-parliamentary-seat-marks-major-shift-in-british-politics/articleshow/111501617.cms,"Nigel Farage 's right-wing populist party, Reform UK, is set to become a significant player in British politics, securing its first-ever parliamentary seat and eroding the Conservative vote share in the results. Farage himself clinched Reform UK 's second victory of the evening in Clacton, overturning a substantial Tory majority of more than 25,000.Lee Anderson, a former Conservative who joined Reform in March, emerged victorious in Ashfield, East Midlands, garnering 34% of the vote and relegating the Conservatives to fourth place with a mere 8.2%.Anderson had previously been elected as a Conservative in the same seat in 2019 with a 39% vote share.Preliminary outcomes in constituencies comfortably won by Labour revealed Reform's robust performance, often pushing Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's Conservatives into third place. Reform secured 29% and 27% of the vote in the first two counts, prompting Farage to express his astonishment, staying, ""That is way more than any possible prediction or projection, it's almost unbelievable.""Reform, originally established as the Brexit Party in 2018 and rebranded in 2022, had not previously secured any seats in an election. Farage is contesting in Clacton, an Essex town that recorded one of the highest votes in favor of leaving the European Union in the 2016 Brexit referendum.The party aims to revolutionize British politics, much like Marine Le Pen's National Rally is doing in France, by adopting a stringent stance on immigration and demanding the return of illegal migrants arriving in small boats from France.Although challenging to implement, this focus has exposed a vulnerability for the Conservatives, who have failed to fulfill Sunak's promise to ""stop the boats."" The Conservative plan to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda also failed to materialize before the election was called.Based on the exit poll, Reform UK was projected to secure 13 out of the 650 seats in the House of Commons. Although this represents a small fraction of the total seats, Farage aspires to utilize this as a stepping stone to challenge the Conservatives and establish his party as the primary right-of-centre alternative to Labour.","Nigel Farage's right-wing populist party, Reform UK, secured its first-ever parliamentary seat.
