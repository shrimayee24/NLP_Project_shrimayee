""He's timed it perfectly - like hitting a ripe mango with a stone.""

This plea shouldn’t have been filed: SC to Varma,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/this-plea-shouldnt-have-been-filed-sc-to-varma/articleshow/122962411.cms,"Constitutional matter politicised, says Sibal

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday told Justice Yashwant Varma, facing removal motion in LS for discovery of sacks of currency notes at his residence premises on March 14 night, that he should not have filed the petition challenging the procedure adopted by the in-house committee after participating in it.As senior advocate Kapil Sibal , appearing for Justice Varma, began his arguments asserting it is 'matters of moment', a bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and A G Masih said ""It is a matter of moment only for the benefit of lawyers who are involved in this petition. This petition must not have been filed."" Sibal took the bench through several SC rulings that barred discussion in public and in Parliament of alleged misconduct of a judge prior to the debate on removal motion. He said by uploading video of burning currency notes and communications between the then CJI and Delhi HC CJ (related to Justice Varma's explanations) on the SC website, the petitioner has been vilified, subjected to media trial & pronounced guilty without an inquiry.While arguing against 'public debate and media trial' over Justice Yashwant Varma, who has identified himself as 'XXX' in his petition before Supreme court, his counsel Kapil Sibal and other MPs have gone public on Allahabad HC's Justice Shekhar Yadav's controversial remark and have signed a notice of motion in Rajya Sabha seeking his removal.Senior advocate Sibal said politics has been introduced into a purely constitutional matter by sending inquiry report by the then CJI to the President and PM with a recommendation to initiate removal motion against the judge. Justice Datta-led bench asked, ""President is the appointing authority, and PM is the head of the executive on whose advice the President acts. Sending the report to them does not mean it amounted to influencing Parliament, where the process is independent of the in-house inquiry report. ""Sibal said, ""How could the in-house inquiry committee conclude that it was a misbehaviour on my part when the cash was found in the outhouse? The committee did not find that the cash belonged to the judge. The judge's staff who were there were not told that the cash was found. The entire procedure of in-house inquiry was flawed and hence the report should be quashed.""Justice Datta said, ""What is the worth of the in-house inquiry report. It is not going to be treated as evidence by the inquiry panel to be set up (by Lok Sabha Speaker) under the Judges Inquiry Act. What are you aggrieved by? If you are aggrieved by the procedure adopted by the in-house committee, why did you participate in its proceedings?""""You are a constitutional authority well versed with the in-house procedure. You could have moved the SC challenging the setting up of the committee or even sought removal of the videos and communications from the SC website. Why did you not do that,"" the bench said and asked as to why the judge in his petition has not attached the inquiry committee report.The bench adjourned hearing a writ petition by advocate Mathews J Nedumpara, who has sought a direction to the Delhi police to register an FIR against Justice Varma for the discovery of unaccounted cash in his official residence premises during a minor fire incident. ""We would like to read the report. You file it. We will take up the matter on Wednesday,"" said the bench.","Supreme Court tells Justice Yashwant Varma he should not have filed the petition challenging the procedure adopted by the in-house committee after participating in it.

New Delhi :

Neither of the three Congress MPs who were part of the multi-party delegations on the govt’s global outreach against Pakistans ponsored terrorism may speak in the Lok Sabha debate on the Pahalgam attack Operation Sindoor issue.Shashi Tharoor and Manish Tewari are not in the shortlist of speakers, while there is no clarity yet on Amar Singh. The party apparently reached out to Tharoor over the weekend but he is said to have turned down the offer to participate in the discussion. He had not expressed adesire on his own till then.Tharoor’s absence provided BJP an opening to needle Congress.BJP MP Baijayant Panda asked Congress to give a “free hand” to its MPs and claimed that Congress leadership was not allowing Tharoor to speak. But, Panda said, he was happy nobody could stop Tharoor from speaking in the country’s interest.Sources said Tharoor has expressed a wish to speak on Indian Ports Bill, with local interest being the Vizhinjam port in his constituency Thiruvananthapuram, recently inaugurated in a high-profile ceremony attended by the PM and netas across party lines.Tewari will speak on the twin legislations related to sports that are to come up soon for discussion in LS.Apparently, the Chandigarh MP had expressed desire to speak initially on the Pahalgam-Sindoor issue, but later plumped for the sports legislations.Sources said as per the inhouse system that includes “performance assessment”, an MP is named to speak on only one big issue to give chance to maximum members.The absence of Tharoor and Tewari has been noticed given they were eager participants in global outreach delegations. Tharoor’s repeated remarks in favour of govt’s claims about Operation Sindoor against Pakistan, and his contradiction of US President Trump’s “ceasefire” claims embarrassed Congress, and led to public arguments with the Congress managers.","Shashi Tharoor and Manish Tewari are not in the shortlist of speakers, while there is no clarity yet on Amar Singh.

CHENNAI/TRICHY :

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s two-day visit to Tamil Nadu has come as a morale booster not just for BJP workers but also for AIADMK rank and file.His meeting with AIADMK netas, including Edappadi K Palaniswami , at the airport is being seen as a reaffirmation of the BJPAIADMK alliance amid recent public disagreements over power-sharing. Modi’s decision to not engage with O Panneerselvam has further reassured AIADMK cadres that BJP values its partnership ahead of the 2026 polls.For BJP workers, Modi’s participation in Aadi Thiruvathirai festival, highlighting Chola glory, served as a cultural counterpoint to DMK’s Keeladi narrative, which accuses BJP of trying to whitewash Tamil Nadu’s rich past.AIADMK is upbeat, especially since not only EPS but also second-rung netas like K P Munusamy, S P Velumani, and Thalavai Sundaram were permitted to receive Modi at the airport. “By rejecting OPS’s request, Modi has sent a signal — only those parties we are comfortable with will be part of alliance,” said senior AIADMK neta S Semmalai.BJP functionaries, too, say the visit has helped build agrassroots-level bond. Some AIADMK cadres who earlier felt EPS was being arm-twisted now see the partnership as voluntary and valued.“AIADMK mobilised cadres for PM’s Trichy roadshow, showing their commitment.We’ll reciprocate in all ways possible,” said Sriram Shankar, BJP’s Trichy district chief. Netas say they are more cautious about their remarks, aware that their actions impact alliance chemistry.Likewise, AIADMK workers in Trichy say their hesitations about working with BJP have eased after the visit. Many now want more such visits to smoothen ties. “We’ll join BJP roadshows in future too,” said one functionary.To cement this rapport further, BJP state chief Nainar Nagenthran will host a feast in Tirunelveli for EPS and AIADMK netas during EPS’s statewide tour. Initially scheduled for Aug 3, the feast was postponed due to Modi’s visit but will soon take place.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s two-day visit to Tamil Nadu has come as a morale booster for BJP workers.
