Mandir-masjid row: ASI says Madhya Pradesh's Vidisha temple is a mosque,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/asi-statement-sparks-mandir-masjid-row/articleshow/112385063.cms,"Hindu groups sought permission to hold puja inside the site on August 9, but ASI cited a 1951 notification classifying it as the 'Bijamandal Mosque.' The permission was denied, causing outrage among Hindu groups.

Vidisha MLA wants survey to prove 'ownership of temple'

BHOPAL: After Bhojshala , a new controversy has emerged in Madhya Pradesh , this time around the ancient Vijay Surya Mandir in MP's Vidisha that is managed by Archaeological Survey of India ( ASI ). Pictures of this temple had gone viral some time ago for its uncanny resemblance to the new Parliament building.For decades, Hindu devotees have observed religious rituals outside the site on Nag Panchami .This year, however, Hindu groups sought permission to enter the premises and hold puja on August 9.District collector Buddesh Vaishya forwarded their request to ASI, which responded by citing a 1951 gazette notification categorizing the site as ' Bijamandal Mosque '. The collector then denied permission for worship, sparking outrage among Hindu groups.They oppose ASI's classification of the site as a mosque, asserting that it has been a place of Hindu worship since 1972.They oppose ASI's classification of the site as a mosque, asserting that it has been a place of Hindu worship since 1972.The Vijay Surya Mandir / Bijamandal mosque site - around 60km from Bhopal and barely 10km from Sanchi Stupa - has had a tumultuous history. The ASI-Bhopal circle website says the mosque was constructed on ruins of a Hindu Temple, and one of the inscriptions found on the pillar says it was a temple of Goddess Charchika.It is believed to have been built in 11th-12th Century to honour Sun God. The temple suffered significant damage during Mughal rule, particularly under Aurangzeb, after which it was repurposed as a mosque in the 17th Century. However, under Maratha rule, the mosque was relocated, and the site fell into disrepair, say locals.In 1934, the discovery of temple ruins sparked a movement, led by Hindu Mahasabha, for its preservation. It had a significant political impact, resulting in the election of Hindu Mahasabha candidates to local offices. Since then, the temple has been opened for worship only once a year, on Nag Panchami.To address communal tensions in 1965, the then chief minister, Dwarka Prasad Mishra, established a separate Idgah for Muslims.With controversy erupting again, Hindu organizations have appealed to PM Narendra Modi to reopen 'Bijamandal Vijay Temple' for regular worship. Collector Buddesh Vaishya told local media everything would be done according to ASI rules. Muslim representatives refrained from speaking to media on controversy.Vidisha BJP MLA Mukesh Tondon has proposed a survey to establish the temple's ownership. This survey, he believes, will confirm the temple's status and potentially lead to ""restoration of its full use for worship"".Tondon acknowledged the Muslim community's stance, noting that they have ""expressed no dispute over the land"". He highlighted the mutual respect between the communities, and cited the district administration's efforts to accommodate Muslim religious practices, particularly on Eid.""The lock placed on the temple by ASI has sparked concerns among Hindus,"" he told reporters, adding that the ASI says the lock is meant to protect some idols that are stored there.""There is no provision for a lock in your rules,"" Tondon said, referencing the legal framework established in 1951 for monument protection. A meeting was held with the district administration to resolve the confusion about the lock, he said, urging ASI to unlock it, especially during the Nag Panchami worship. The MLA intends to raise the issue in assembly and is organizing a team to visit Delhi to meet PM Modi, and minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat.The MLA recounted a similar situation in April 1992, when a protest led to a successful negotiation with ASI and district officials, allowing a team of 11 people to perform puja at the temple. He noted that Hindu families have continued to worship at the site, with no restrictions imposed by ASI. TNN","Hindu groups sought permission to hold puja inside the site on August 9.
