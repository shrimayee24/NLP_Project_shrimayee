Union Minister Giriraj Singh on Saturday expressed confidence that the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is set for a decisive victory in the upcoming Bihar Assembly elections , while criticising the opposition bloc, Mahagathbandhan, for being fragmented. Singh said, ""dil ke tukde hazaar huye, koi yahan gire, koi wahan gire.""He further asserted, ""In 2010, JD(U) and BJP made a record together when they won 206 seats. This time, we will go higher than that. We have 'neta' (leader), 'netritva' (leadership) and program. There is no such thing as 'mahagathbandhan', there is no trust in Tejashwi Yadav. They are not ready to consider each other leaders. They neither have 'neta' nor 'netritva'.""Taking a dig at the opposition, Singh added,as quoted by ANI, ""Mahagathbandhan is in the condition of 'dil ke tukde hazaar huye, koi yahan gire, koi wahan gire.' They are facing each other on 4 dozen seats...Their 'gathbandhan' proved to be 'thugbandhan'. They are deceiving each other. This shows that they are dejected and frustrated.""The Mahagathbandhan, comprising the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Indian National Congress (INC), and Left parties including the Communist Party of India (CPI), Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Liberation-CPIML (Liberation), and Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPIM), is yet to finalise its candidates and seat distribution.In contrast, the ruling NDA has shared its seat distribution list and has already begun groundwork across key constituencies.Earlier today, Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) leader Chirag Paswan met Union Home Minister Amit Shah in Patna to discuss the NDA’s preparations and strategy for the upcoming polls.Polling for the Bihar Assembly elections 2025 is scheduled for November 6 and 11, with results to be announced on November 14.","Union Minister Giriraj Singh expressed confidence that the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is set for a decisive victory in the upcoming Bihar Assembly elections.

CHANDIGARH: In another dramatic twist in IPS officer Y Puran Kumar’s suicide, Rohtak police on Wednesday registered an FIR of abetment to suicide and criminal conspiracy, naming all those mentioned in the final video of ASI Sandeep Kumar Lather, who allegedly shot himself on Tuesday after accusing Puran Kumar of corruption.The FIR (number 305) was registered at Sadar police station in Rohtak a few hours after Haryana CM Nayab Singh Saini visited Sandeep’s family in Ladhot village on Wednesday morning and promised justice.The FIR had not been made public at the time of filing this report, but according to highly placed sources, four persons are named in it — including the deceased IPS officer’s wife Amneet P Kumar, an IAS officer of 2001 batch, her brother Amit Rattan, who is an AAP MLA in Punjab, and head constable Sushil Kumar, who was Puran Kumar’s PSO and is now in jail remand in a corruption case.The FIR was registered under BNS sections 108 (abetment to suicide) and 61 (criminal conspiracy) on a complaint submitted by Sandeep’s wife Santosh. TOI contacted Amit Rattan but was yet to get any response till midnight.Sources say Virendra Badkhalsa, OSD to Haryana CM, informed Sandeep’s family about registration of FIR on Wednesday evening. TOI has spoken with two of the negotiators who were present when the contents of the FIR were read out to the family.Only then did Sandeep’s family agree to an autopsy. Around the same time, Puran Kumar’s body was being cremated in Chandigarh, 230km away, after eight days of stalemate.Sandeep’s body, which was so far kept in a hired freezer by the family, was taken to PGIMS Rohtak at night. Cremation will follow postmortem on Thursday morning, said sources in the family.Sandeep was part of the team that was investigating the case allegedly involving Puran Kumar, and was also involved in the arrest of Puran Kumar’s former PSO on Oct 5.It was this FIR, registered on Oct 6, that’s alleged to be the trigger for Puran Kumar’s suicide as Sushil was alleged to have given a statement that he was demanding money on behalf of Puran Kumar, who was then Rohtak IG.Haryana govt found itself battling on two fronts. Amneet and other members of the family had refused to allow autopsy until action was taken against DGP Shatrujeet Kapur and then Rohtak SP Narendra Bijarniya, who were among those named by Puran Kumar in his suicide note. Bijarniya was transferred on Oct 10 and Kapur was sent on leave on Monday midnight.Less than 12 hours after Kapur was sent on leave, Sandeep shot himself after releasing a final video in which he called Kapur honest and accused Puran Kumar of corruption. In the video, he said Puran Kumar’s suicide was due to “humiliation from corruption charges” and had “nothing to do with caste issues”.Sandeep’s family took away his body, kept it in a freezer in Ladhot, and refused to allow autopsy or cremation until an FIR was registered against all those he had named in the video and his four-page suicide note.The Haryana CM, accompanied by ministers Krishan Lal Panwar and Mahipal Singh Dhanda, rushed to the village on the outskirts of Rohtak on Wednesday morning to console the family. Sandeep’s sisters tearfully asked Saini what was their brother’s fault, and pleaded for justice, said a source.The CM assured the grieving family that appropriate action would be taken, and justice would be delivered.Apart from the FIR, the family wanted a job for a relative and financial assistance, to which govt agreed.","Haryana CM Nayab Singh Saini visited Sandeep Kumar Lather's family in Ladhot village on Wednesday morning and promised justice.
