HC closes Amritpal's plea for temporary release after Punjab facilitated him in filing nomination for LS Polls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hc-closes-amritpals-plea-for-temporary-release-after-punjab-facilitated-him-in-filing-nomination-for-ls-polls/articleshow/110024931.cms,"CHANDIGARH: The Punjab government on Friday informed the Punjab and Haryana High Court that it has facilitated the radical Sikh preacher Amritpal Singh in filing his nomination papers for the Lok Sabha seat from the Khadoor Sahib parliamentary seat in Punjab.In its detailed reply, the state government informed the Punjab and Haryana High Court on Friday that two sets of nomination forms and other paperwork were filled out and signed by Amritpal on May 9, and he was allowed to meet his proposer and advocate at Dibrugarh Central Jail at that time.This information was provided before the High Court by the state in response to a petition filed by Amritpal Singh seeking directions to grant him seven days' release from jail so that he can file his nomination papers for the Khadoor Sahib Lok Sabha seat. He had also sought directions to facilitate him in getting some photographs taken and opening a bank account for the purpose of filing the nomination paper.The High Court has also directed the Superintendent of Central Jail Dibrugarh to administer the oath to the detenue (Amritpal) as per the provisions of the law, including the Handbook for Candidate 2023, and issue a Certificate for Receipt of Oath, sending the original form of Oath to the Returning Officer, Khadoor Sahib, Punjab.It was also stated that the necessary steps had already been taken on May 9, and all relevant documents, signatures, and photographs placed before the Superintendent of Central Jail Dibrugarh stand attested.With these submissions made by the state, the petition filed by Amritpal was rendered infructuous.Amritpal, currently lodged in Dibrugarh Jail in Assam, was arrested on April 23 and detained under the National Security Act (NSA) Act, 1980.

Further directions have also been sought to facilitate him in several other activities, including getting his latest photograph taken and opening a new bank account, to ensure he completes all formalities regarding contesting the election.",Punjab government says it has facilitated radical Sikh preacher Amritpal Singh in filing his nomination papers for the Lok Sabha seat from the Khadoor Sahib parliamentary seat in Punjab.

Will mythological Misrikh see saffron surge once again?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-mythological-misrikh-see-saffron-surge-once-again/articleshow/110024903.cms,"A mixed bag for saffron

Poll dynamics

Situated around 100km away from Lucknow, Misrikh-Neemsar is a land steeped in mythology where the pantheon of 33 Hindu gods and goddesses reside.Just like Kashi, Mathura, and Ayodhya, Neemsar (or Naimish Dham) draws huge crowds throughout the year and provides employment to thousands of people.The Misrikh Lok Sabha constituency, which is among the most backward, is going to polls in the fourth phase on May 13.A part of Sitapur district, Misrikh comprises five assembly constituencies out of which three are in Hardoi (Sandila, Balamau and Bilgram-Mallawan), one in Kanpur (Bilhaur) and the fifth, Misrikh in Sitapur.The campaign pitch is getting shriller in the religious town as candidates are going all out to woo voters.In a direct battle, sitting BJP MP Ashok Kumar Rawat (49) will take on SP contender Sangita Rajvanshi. A three-term MP (twice with BSP), Rawat has the backing of the saffron symbol, presence in local events and support from various caste groups.Sangita (41), daughter-in-law of former minister, three-time MLA and Samajwadi Party veteran Rampal Rajvanshi, is banking on the support of Muslims who play a crucial role in the constituency, besides the support of fellow community members and Dalits.A reserved seat, Misrikh has about 30% SC voters. Both Rawat and Rajvanshi come from Pasi (Paswan) community and are reaching out to both Jatavs and non-Jatavs to stand behind them instead of BSP. BSP candidate BR Ahirwar (61) is dubbed as an outsider (since he is from Kanpur) and would try to consolidate the cadre vote. Interestingly, before switching over to the saffron camp, Rawat has twice been elected as BSP candidate from Misrikh in 2004 and 2009. During the 2022 assembly elections , BJP won all the five seats while BSP could not finish second in any of the five constituencies.Though BJP still enjoys considerable support, unlike previous elections, it might not be a cakewalk for the saffron party as voters give a mixed reaction on the party’s prospects.Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath ’s rally on Tuesday had some impact on voters. Local traders in Neemsar said that the number of tourists and business opportunities had increased ever since Ram temple was opened in Ayodhya. A lot of families from other states coming to Ayodhya have been visiting Neemsar as well.“The BJP govt has shown strong commitment for religious tourism. The makeover of Ayodhya and Mirzapur (Vindhyavasini corridor) under Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s watch has been witnessed by everybody. Yogi has been saying that the focus would now be on Neemsar,” said Shiv Prakash Mishra (56) from Chawan, a village dominated by upper caste.Yogi’s assurance to provide four-lane connectivity, helicopter service, electric bus service and makeover of Lalita Mata Mandir, which has a lot of scope for religious tourism, rings a bell with lower caste members as well.However, there are a few issues which have left voters apprehensive.“We have been hearing that if BJP comes to power, it will snatch away reservation which is being provided to Dalits. I do not know BJP’s intention as it has not clearly said what it would do after forming the govt again. A sense of insecurity is palpable among ‘bahujans’,” said Baijnath Raidas from Amkherwa village who works as a help in a mango orchard. “Finding a farm labourer is getting increasingly difficult with time and the ones who get ready to work during harvest are demanding Rs 300- 400 a day. This reflects growing inflation. It will not be easy for BJP this time,” said Kalicharaj Rajvanshi from Kohrava village.Anun Kumar Maurya (25) of Ambkerwa village near Naimish Dham is disappointed over cancellation of police recruitment drive due to paper leak. “A limited number of jobs are available for youths. If 80 out of 100 youths do not find jobs, they will always complain about unemployment. We have enough to survive in the village but our expenses would go up substantially if we move to a city,” said Maurya.Though any wave in favour of Narendra Modi is not evident, the rural population of Misrikh is not unhappy with the present dispensation either.Supporters of Sangita have been unable to corner Rawat over local issues and are instead confident that voters in Machhrehta (Rajvanshi family is from the same place) and other Muslim dominated pockets within Sandila, Bilgram and Mallawan would vote en masse for Akhilesh Yadav.The party office in Misrikh is abuzz with activity. Gearing up for the day’s schedule, Mohd Yusuf (65) from Nibha village in Gondlamau block, draped in saffron ‘gamchha’ and BJP party cap over his head, was ready to get on the convoy of motor vehicles. “I have been associated with the local MLA for the last 15 years. I have a lot of expectations from BJP. I do not own any land and need financial assistance to sustain myself,” said Yusuf, adding he would convince minority voters to look at the bigger picture. Barely 300 metres away, workers of Samajwadi Party were getting their motor vehicles refuelled at a gas station before starting the day’s campaign. Ranjeet, a youth at the wheels of an SUV, said: “Quality of water being drawn through hand pumps is deteriorating. Condition of roads has worsened in the last five years.”One of the common grouses in the local community was the absence of industry and economic activity.","The Misrikh Lok Sabha constituency, which is among the most backward, is going to polls in the fourth phase on May 13.

‘Poll fight will be between son of Sonia Gandhi & Rae Bareli ka beta’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/poll-fight-will-be-between-son-of-sonia-gandhi-rae-bareli-ka-beta/articleshow/110024378.cms,"A minister in the Yogi Adityanath govt and BJP candidate against Congress’s Rahul Gandhi from Rae Bareli constituency, Dinesh Singh, claims that the Gandhis have no right to seek support citing good deeds of their ancestors. In conversation with Shailvee Sharda, he says that Rae Bareli is no longer a Congress bastion as people have aligned themselves with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Excerpts

You are a challenger to Rahul Gandhi, the face of India’s opposition in this election . How do you see your candidature?

Why is the opposition meaningless to you?

You also defy the notion that the Gandhi family has a legacy in Rae Bareli. Why?

What is your main argument to the voters?

What edge do you have over Congress party’s pitch?

Priyanka Gandhi is camping here for Rahul’s campaign. How much do you see that translating into votes?

Why do you keep mentioning Rahul’s grandfather in your statements?

MLA Aditi Singh was not seen in your nomination. Is there any infighting?

I have already thanked my party for showing faith in me in this crucial battle. I am a committed sepoy of the BJP and will take on the overrated opposition with all my might. On this seat, I don’t see them as an opposition at all.Sonia Gandhi is not the true representative of the people of Rae Bareli. She has barely faced any opposition in elections.In 2019 too, she was technically a candidate of four parties – Congress, SP, Apna Dal (Krishna Patel group) and BSP. Though Congress may have won the seat, that was far from being a moral victory. She did not even bother to come and collect her certificate.I am not denying their connection with Rae Bareli. There was a time when Rahul’s grandfather (Feroze Gandhi) and his grandmother Indira Gandhi made Rae Bareli their home. But then, there were years when people of Rae Bareli chose others. Things change and if one cannot accept that, one becomes redundant. As far as political presence is concerned, the Congress doesn’t have an MLA, MLC, block pramukh, pradhan or a single elected representative. What legacy are they claiming?I am the son of this soil. I am available to people unlike Sonia Gandhi or Rahul Gandhi. Sonia did not come to Rae Bareli even once in five years even in time of crisis like Covid-19 pandemic or a railway accident, but when her son was to file the papers, she braved the sun for hours. But I am here for anyone in need. So, this election will be ‘Sonia ka beta’ versus ‘Rae Bareli ka beta’.Development. The work done by the double engine govt will speak for itself. Four-lane highways connect Rae Bareli with Prayagraj, Ayodhya and Kanpur. It is being linked to Ganga Expressway. The railway station has been redeveloped with entry and exit on two sides. AIIMS finally got functional. The kind of development that Modiji has brought for Rae Bareli is way more than what Sonia Gandhi could bring even as ‘super PM’.Her presence is a non-issue to us and people of Rae Bareli. She attracts media but has little impact. In 2022 assembly polls too, she stayed here and asked for votes in every nook and corner. She could gather barely 16,000.He was the first MP from Rae Bareli in independent India. And another fact is that ‘jo apne baba ka nahi hua woh Rae Bareli ka kya hoga’. They are in the habit of calling a place their home and then forgetting it. They called Amethi their family but forgot it. They say Wayanad is family, they would forget it too. They also say Rae Bareli is their family. In Indian culture, you can’t change family like clothes.Her absence from my nomination doesn’t mean that she is against me or not with the Congress. She is my sister and was unwell that day. She also called me up to tell me that she was available for party as and when required.","Dinesh Singh is a minister in the Yogi Adityanath govt and BJP candidate against Congress’s Rahul Gandhi from Rae Bareli constituency.

‘We are more religious than BJP but don’t mix faith with politics’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/we-are-more-religious-than-bjp-but-dont-mix-faith-with-politics/articleshow/110024699.cms,"Congress-backed SP candidate and former MP Annu Tandon claims that the opposition parties are more religious than BJP, but they do not mix religion with politics . Talking to Pankaj Shah amid her hectic campaign, she says that the SP-Congress ‘gathbandhan’ was a formidable alliance which the BJP will have to reckon with this time. She maintains that SP is certainly surging ahead because of the mass base that it has cultivated over the years. Excerpts:

Samajwadi Party has been emerging as a potent rival of the BJP. Is it really posing any challenge?

What about the Congress which you represented as an MP from Unnao in 2009? The party is now your alliance partner.

Was prompted you to leave the Congress which you represented as an MP from Unnao?

Don’t you think that BJP’s organisational strength and popularity of PM Narendra Modi and CM Yogi Adityanath is overshadowing opposition?

The opposition has been accusing the BJP of using religion as a political tool. Your views.

Is BJP politically smarter than opposition?

Why should people look for a change this time?

Yes. The party has a huge mass base because of party founder Mulayam Singh Yadav who earned the sobriquet of ‘dhartiputra’ (son of the soil). And that he was. Now, his son and party president Akhilesh Yadav is following in his father’s footsteps by not only taking forward the party’s ideology but also doing what needs to be done. He is not only educated and progressive but also down to earth.Congress has lost a lot of ground over the last few years, especially in UP. That could have been because of the lack of management or control over the party. Another factor is that it is a very old party. The older generation which was once highly motivated seems to have been sidelined and the younger generation does not have that enthusiasm, ideological bent and attachment towards the party.I was not able to help my people the way I wanted to. Congress was not able to fight.What happened in 2014 and thereafter was not because of BJP’s strength but because of just one person who was pitched as someone who would destroy the Congress and bring about a complete political revolution uprooting corruption. BJP made statements which were baseless. But now their claims are exposed. People have started understanding the BJP’s ploy.We are not against religion. We are very religious. But for us, religion and looking after the people are different things. In India, people are primarily gullible and God-fearing. The issue of ‘aastha’ (faith) is something which is very big. Using religion as a political tool is unfortunate. People are poor and desperate and when someone says there will be a magic and ‘Ram Rajya’ would usher in, people fall in the trap.That is not smartness. It is devious. It is like using the name of God to achieve your political goal. I know what people want. Hindu want a ‘mandir’, Muslims want a ‘masjid’, Christians want churches. Besides that, people also want employment and growth. But the BJP is trying to satisfy the people with just 5kg of ration. Actually, 80 crore people getting free ration sends a very bad message to the world.Farmers are in a bad condition. They are not getting adequate prices for their produce. The problem of stray animals is another issue which has been squarely left out. They say there are ‘gaushalas’ but they are there just for the sake of it. Education and employment are also important. There are no jobs in govt or private sector.","Annu Tandon is the Congress-backed SP candidate in the Uttar Pradesh elections.

"In Teni’s Kheri, farmers’ killings a closed chapter for many",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-tenis-kheri-farmers-killings-a-closed-chapter-for-many/articleshow/110024476.cms,"LAKHIMPUR KHERI

:

The blood that was spilled in Tikunia village on Oct 3 three years ago is like the spot on Lady Macbeth’s hand. Some swear they see it even today, others don’t.It was here, a little distance away from the Kaudiyala Sahib gurdwara, on the T-point just in front of a power sub-station’s billing counter, that four protesting farmers and a local journalist were felled when a vehicle owned by junior home minister Ajay Mishra ‘Teni’ — and allegedly driven by his son Ashish — ploughed through them.In quick retaliation, three members of the convoy – two BJP workers and a driver – were killed by the villagers.Echoes of that violent afternoon are still heard in Lakhimpur Kheri as Mishra seeks re-election for the third time, having won convincingly from the seat twice – in 2014 and 2019. As one travels onward from Shahjahanpur, passing by a belt in the Terai considered so fertile that old timers say you can water a stone and it will sprout leaves, talk about the polls is invariably punctuated by references to the tragedy in Tikunia. It’s al ways “that incident” addressed variously by locals as “woh hadsa…kand…durghatna”.Sitting by a field in Palia where stubble is being burnt for a quick “satha dhaan” — literally a paddy crop grown in 60 days after farmers sandwich it between harvests of sugarcane and wheat, a practice banned in some states because of the enormous quantities of water that must be used — Prabhjot Singh says he won’t vote this time. “It’s pointless,” he said. “Teni is likely to win again.”Almost 40km beyond Palia, there is a line of fragile, tottery shacks on the mouth of the Sharda Barrage in Dhaurahara that sell aloo tikki and chai and cold drinks in luminescent yellow and orange bottles. Jayprakash Sahu owns one of the shops. He is busy as a group of people returning from Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav’s rally have stopped for nashtapani (refreshments). “There will be floods soon. Sharda will drive us away,” he said. “Life is tough. But benefits have reached us. We won’t lie. I think Teni is ahead again though the ballot is mostly for the BJP, not the candidate.”In Lakhimpur Kheri Lok Sabha constituency, SCs and STs make up the biggest chunk, with about 25%, followed by Kurmis and Brahmins. Muslims, at roughly 14%, and Sikhs, together with Thakurs, Yadavs, Vaishyas and Kayashthas complete the other half. Up against Teni, a Brahmin, are the SP’s Utkarsh Verma and the BSP’s Anshay Kalra, a Punja bi. At a recent meeting in the district, Mayawati said this is an opportunity for the people to avenge the blight of Tikunia.But if there is anger against Teni, it will be splintered. “What can we do,” asked Kulvinder Singh, a farmer from Naurangabad village. “Chaudhary (RLD leader Jayant Singh) should not have joined the NDA. Of course, we will fight and defeat Ajay Mishra. There are a lot of people unhappy with him.”It may not be easy. Months after the happenings in Tikunia, the BJP in 2022 swept not just the assembly seat of Lakhimpur but four others in the vicinity, stamping with authority its hold in the constituency. And this was after thousands of farmers had converged — representatives coming in from 75 districts of UP and each Indian state along with a bunch of opposition leaders – for the antim ardas (last rites) of the four dead villagers and the journalist, Raman Kashyap. They had then vowed to overthrow Teni and demanded his sacking as minister.Mishra himself has been somewhat subdued in his campaign this time, as if unwilling to tempt fate. It hasn’t helped that the Supreme Court a few days ago expressed serious concern at reports that Ashish Mishra , a prime accused in the Tikunia case who’s out on bail, violated conditions to canvass for his father.Importantly, some of the BJP legislators have refused to be seen with Mishra, complaining about his “highhandedness”. An MLA in Lakhimpur Kheri, requesting anonymity, told TOI, “If people don’t vote for him despite the Modi factor, the party shouldn’t be surprised. They can’t stand his arrogance. We had given feedback about a negative wave against Teni, but the brass decided to give him another chance, maybe because of the caste factor.”Another MLA said, “I have been talking to people in my constituency and many say that they won’t support him. They love the BJP but they equally dislike Teni.”Acharya Sanjay Mishra, VHP’s prant pracharak, said, “It’s true. Barring one MLA, the rest aren’t backing Teni. But the BJP will triumph because the vote is for PM Modi and (CM) Yogi Adityanath .”Sprawling Lakhimpur Kheri, the biggest UP district in terms of size, with bountiful rivers crisscrossing it and giant forests forming a canopy over its head – is poised for a fight. In the district that borders Nepal – motorbikes from that country with their red registration plates whizz by frequently — one of those with high stakes in the battle is Pawan Kashyap, brother of the journalist who died in Tikunia.“It’s been three years since bhai (brother) passed on. Of the 208 witnesses, only five have been examined. I’ve filed petitions to fast-track the case many times in the Supreme Court. It’s hard, but I get courage from those who’ve stood behind me. There is great resistance to Teni. Let’s see.”",Ajay Mishra 'Teni' is seeking re-election for the third time in Lakhimpur Kheri. He won convincingly from the seat twice – in 2014 and 2019.

Why Lalu is both right and wrong about Muslim reservation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-lalu-is-both-right-and-wrong-about-muslim-reservation/articleshow/110020598.cms,"Lalu Prasad has intensified the

Muslim reservation

debate that was triggered by PM Modi’s allegation that

Congress

aims to slice up the OBC quota for its minority vote bank. Prasad says Muslims should get reservation but then adds a caveat. The Constitution does not endorse reservation in jobs and education along religious lines. However, some govts have interpreted its provisions to extend reservation benefits to certain Muslim communities

Inputs from Rajesh Sharma

Should Muslims get reservation in jobs and higher education in India? This question has become a subject of intense political debate after Prime Minister Narendra Modi targeted Congress, accusing it of acting against “the spirit of the Constitution” by attempting to create quota for Muslims.In his recent speeches, Modi alleged that Congress tried a “pilot project” in Andhra Pradesh; the PM then went on to include the Karnataka quota row in the debate.On Tuesday (May 7), RJD chief Lalu Prasad, who has been a strong votary of reservation in jobs and higher education for those socially and economically backward, answered the question in affirmation. “Reservation to milna chahiye Musalmanon ko, poora (Muslims should get reservation),” said Prasad during the swearing-in ceremony of 11 new MLCs, including his wife and former Bihar CM Rabri Devi.The issue became a hot political debate during the ongoing Lok Sabha election after Modi told a rally in Rajasthan’s Tonk in April, “As soon as Congress formed the govt at the Centre in 2004, one of its first tasks was to reduce the SC/ST reservation in Andhra and give the quota to Muslims. Between 2004 and 2010, Congress made four attempts to introduce Muslim reservation in that state, but it could not succeed because of legal impediments and Supreme Court’s alertness.” Modi later also alleged that Congress gave a separate quota for Muslims in Karnataka along religious lines through their inclusion in the OBC list in the state. The allegations came just before Karnataka voted in the LS election on April 26.In the political back and forth between the two rival camps, RJD’s Prasad added his bit, drawing strong reactions from BJP and its allies. At a rally in Bihar’s Darbhanga, Modi said, “Shocking statement by Lalu Ji on snatching reservation from SC, ST and OBC communities in favour of petty vote-bank politics. We will never let this happen.”Finding himself in the line of fire as Modi pitted Prasad’s once core vote bank – Muslims – against the other – backward class communities – the RJD patriarch realised his remarks might confuse Hindus and boomerang on his party’s or alliance’s prospects, and sought to clarify his statement.He said, “The basis for reservation is social backwardness. Narendra Modi wants to finish reservation. Religion cannot be a basis for reservation. I am senior to Narendra Modi...”Prasad also said, “The Mandal Commission report was implemented by us [during the VP Singh govt]. No one should lecture us on it.”Earlier, Modi’s comments saw National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC) chief Hansraj Ahir seeking clarification from the Karnataka chief secretary regarding the categorisation of the OBC quota and “blanket reservation” to Muslims under Category II-B.The NCBC data shows Muslims form about 13% of Karnataka’s population. The state provides 32% reservation for OBCs in jobs and higher education. A sub-category comprising 4% is reserved for Muslims in Karnataka.The story goes back to 1975Set up by the Devaraj Urs-led Congress govt, the LG Havanur-led Karnataka Backward Classes Commission presented its report in 1975, recognising Muslims as eligible for reservation. Muslims were categorised under backward communities alongside other groups like SCs and STs. Havanur was a legal luminary who shuttled in politics from Congress to BJP (his last political association, ending in 1999), and was also invited to the body framing the South African constitution in 1991.Subsequently, in March 1977, the Karnataka govt issued a directive granting reservation to backward classes, including Muslims. However, the OBC list excluded Lingayats but included Vokkaligas, leading to protests by Lingayats, who subsequently moved the court.SC backed the Havanur report’s recommendations and a Constitution bench said depravations of poverty are aggravated by the consideration of castes.The two Janata panelsTwo more backward commissions were set up by Karnataka govt during the 1980s by the Ramkrishna Hegde-led Janata Party govt. The T Venkataswamy Commission was set up in 1984. The second backward commission’s report differed from the first as it excluded both Vokkaligas and Lingayats from the backward classes category while recognising Muslims as socially and educationally backward.Vokkaligas now felt offended and enraged. Being the backbone of the political base of the Janata Party in Karnataka, the Hegde govt decided to reject the Venkataswamy Commission report.It then set up the third backward commission under Justice O Chinnappa Reddy in March 1988. The panel submitted its report to the Veerendra Patil govt of Congress in April 1990 and the report was placed before the assembly in June 1990. This commission also recognised Muslims as eligible for reservation based on backwardness.However, the report led to huge protests as it excluded the Lingayats, Vokkaligas, Catholic Christians, Ganigas and Devangas from the list of backward classes.Finally, Muslim reservationThe Reddy commission proposed placing Muslims in Category 2 of the OBC list. In 1994, the Veerappa Moily-led Congress govt decided to implement the recommendations. It announced a 6% quota in Category 2B, labelled ‘More Backward’, for Muslims, Buddhists, and SC converts to Christianity. Muslims were given a 4% reservation, while the remaining 2% was reserved for Buddhists and SC con verts to Christianity.But the govt order was challenged in court, and in September 1994 SC passed an interim order limiting overall reservation to 50%. This was also a time of huge political turmoil in Karnataka, leading to the collapse of the Moily govt in December 1994 – even before it could act on the top court’s interim order.HD Deve Gowda of Janata Dal became the Karnataka CM, and in February 1995 he implemented the new quota plan with some adjustments as per SC’s interim verdict. Muslims were given 4% reservation in educational institutions and govt jobs under the 2B quota. Interestingly, Deve Gowda is now an ally of BJP, contesting the LS election in Karnataka under PM Modi’s leadership.BJP’s attemptThis reservation scheme stayed in place with minor tweaks until the Basavraj Bommai govt of BJP proposed to revoke it in March 2023, months ahead of the Karnataka assembly election. BJP suggested the creation of two new categories 2C and 2D for Vokkaligas and Lingayats— each getting a 2% reservation in jobs and higher education. The move aimed to remove the 2B category for Muslims and in cluding them under the 10% quota for economically weaker sections.This proposal sparked fierce political opposition and a court battle, forcing the govt to shelve the proposal. In April 2023, SC also prima facie observed the Bommai govt’s decision to scrap the 4% quota for Muslims as OBC beneficiary “shaky and flawed”.The Andhra experimentIn Andhra, Muslims make up around 9.5% of the population, according to the 2011 Census. Here, specific Muslim communities like the Dudekula, Laddaf, Noorbash, and Mehtar have OBC quota benefits of up to 10%. These groups were found to be poorer and lagging behind even SCs in terms of educa tion and socio-economic conditions.This reservation falls under the BC-E category, distinct from the existing OBC quota, ensuring no overlap. However, there’s a campaign to include all Muslims in the OBC category, on the lines of Karnataka and Kerala.After the 2004 parliamentary and assembly polls, with Congress in office at the Centre and in the state, it asked the Commissionerate of Minorities Welfare to look into the “socio-economic and educational conditions of the Muslim community” in then united Andhra for their inclusion in the OBC list.Based on the Commissionerate recommendation, a 5% reservation was given to “Muslim minorities in employment, educational and other fields on par with the Backward Classes” in Andhra, fulfilling Congress’ promise in its poll manifesto. The scheme was implemented in July 2004. But it was subsequently challenged in court. A five-judge bench of Andhra Pradesh HC in Sept 2004 struck down this quota for all Muslims as unconstitutional. It said the reservation was implemented without consulting the state’s Backward Classes Commission as statutorily mandated.HC also found that the quota for Muslims did not exclude the “creamy layer”, disregarding SC’s directives in the Indra Sawhney judgment of 1992. HC directed Andhra govt to reconstitute the Commission for Backward Classes and formulate its quota plan based on the panel’s recommendations.Subsequently, Andhra govt brought out an ordinance —Andhra Pradesh Reservation of Seats in the Educational Institutions and of Appointments or Posts in the Public Services under the State to Muslim Community Ordinance — in 2005. It was later replaced by a law providing for 5% quota for Muslims in higher education and jobs. This was based on Backward Classes Commission’s finding that the Muslim community was “socially, educationally and economically backward” and therefore entitled to affirmative action.But the law took the total quota in the state to 51%, breaching the 50% quota ceiling fixed by SC, as existing reservations were not changed. Andhra Pradesh HC again struck down the Act for being based on “unscientific and defective criteria”.The YS Rajasekhara Reddy-led Congress state govt then promulgated another ordinance providing 4% reservation to 14 categories of poor Muslims, thereby bringing reservation under the 50% cap. This too was challenged and struck down by HC in 2010.The HC ruling was subsequently challenged in SC.In an interim order in 2010, SC directed that the quote continue till the court had heard the issue. The case was subsequently referred to a Constitution Bench. Thus, the Muslim quota law remains unaffected in Andhra. The case has not come up for hearing in SC.Do Muslims have an all-India reservation?Contrary to the popular perception, Muslims are not a homogenous group. Several Muslim communities get reservation under OBC category at the central and state levels, stemming from Article 16(4), which guarantees quota for a “backward class of citizens”. If a Muslim caste is classified as socially and economically backward, it gets reservation at central and state levels.Currently, 36 Muslim communities listed in Categories 1 and 2A are included in the central OBC list. However, families earning more than Rs 8 lakh a year are considered in the creamy layer and not considered for quota benefits. At least a dozen states and Union territories have a quota for one or more Muslim communities in some form Andhra, Assam, Bihar, Gujarat and MP, to name a few.What about those who have converted to Islam?Apart from the provisions discussed above, Muslims are not entitled to reservation benefits. There have been arguments about extending the quota benefits to persons belonging to SCs if they convert to Islam or Christianity. This is currently guided by Scheduled Caste Order of 1950, amended several times over decades. The 1950 SC order says no person professing a religion different from Hinduism or Sikhism or Buddhism can be deemed an SC. However, this top court order acknowledges the presence of Dalits among Muslims.National Commission on Minorities in 2008 recommended extension of reservation benefits to Dalit Muslims and Dalit Christians. A petition has been pending before SC seeking reservation benefits for converted SCs.BJP and PM Modi have spoken against granting reservation benefits to SC Muslims or SC Christians. The issue may see a closure with a top court judgment whenever it comes as the SC order of 1950 is categorical on the issue of conversion. It says, “A convert or re-convert to Hinduism and Sikhism shall be accepted as a member of Scheduled Caste if he has been received back and accepted as a member of the concerned Scheduled Caste.”","Lalu Prasad says Muslims should get reservation but then adds a caveat. The Constitution does not endorse reservation in jobs and education along religious lines. However, some govts have interpreted its provisions to extend reservation benefits to certain Muslim communities.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110024226,imgsize-1766560,width-400,resizemode-4/110024226.jpg"

It said the charges were meant to “create confusion, misdirection and impediments in the conduct of free and fair polls”.Refuting allegations of discrepancies point by point, EC detailed the process to argue that there was no room for interference in the procedure and nothing could go unnoticed by the candidates or their representatives.It said political parties know the number of voters at every stage, with the booth-wise number available to candidates. Besides, it said, there was no scope for any deviation with the number of votes polled, which was recorded in Form 17C, and a signed copy was made available to candidates at the close of voting. Also, on the day of counting, the votes polled in the EVM were tallied with Form 17C in the presence of the candidates or their agents. It said no instance of deviation from the norms was flagged by any Congress candidate in any of the 283 seats that went to the polls in the first three phases.“A trend of irresponsible statements attacking or attempting to degrade the credibility of elections in terms of men and material by a national political party is disconcerting,” EC said, while “advising” Kharge to refrain from such comments.Responding to Kharge questioning the increase in turnout by around 5.5 percentage points in the first phase and about 5.7 percentage points in the second, and delay in publication of voter turnout data, EC said there was no delay and pointed out that the updated turnout data has always been higher than what was released on polling day. To back this, it shared the ‘factual matrix’ of figures from elections, beginning with the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.The commission accused Kharge of pushing a “biased narrative” under the guise of seeking clarifications and pointed to his party colleague Randeep Singh Surjewala’s attempts to spread rumours around the use of EVMs from South Africa during last year’s assembly elections in Karnataka.“The commission has come to notice a design/pattern in creating a false narrative during election period, which unfortunately appears to be continued by your letter,” it said.“As a senior parliamentarian, a very seasoned politician, with experience of 52 years in electoral politics and electoral process, and as the head of a prominent national political party, you must be aware that EC follows most transparent process of preparation of electoral roll and well designed and well tested participation of political parties/candidates at every stage of the process,” EC said.","Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge questioned the increase in turnout by around 5.5 percentage points in the first phase.

said ""Mani Shankar Aiyar is telling us to respect Pakistan as it possesses an atomic bomb.

Few days ago, INDIA alliance leader Farooq Abdullah said do not talk about PoK as Pakistan has an atomic bomb. I want to tell the Congress and INDIA alliance that PoK belongs to India and no force can snatch it,"" Shah said at an election rally in Jharkhand's Khunti.

In the interview, Aiyar, a confidant of Nehru-Gandhi family, argued that muscle flexing against Pakistan could be counter-productive considering the possibility of ""crazy guys over there"" deciding to use nuclear weapons against India. ""They have got their muscles in Kahuta"", Aiyar said in a reference to the Pakistan nulcear plant which produces weapon-grade uranimum.

Shah was scathing in its response. ""I do not know what has happened to the Congress.

A resolution was passed unanimously in Parliament that PoK is part of India. You (Congress) are now putting a question mark on PoK by talking about the atom bomb.

The home minister said that instead of taking back PoK from Pakistan during their regime, Congress is now seeking to unnerve India by talking about atom bombs. At a press conference, Union minister Rajeev Chandrashekhar said that the Congress party has turned into an 'apologist' and 'defender' of Pakistan and terrorism while Pakistan's foreign minister is backing Rahul Gandhi

""The statement of Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar actually exposes the ideology and policies of Rahul Gandhi and the entire Congress party, which shows their closeness with Pakistan which sponsors terrorism and works as propagandist for Pakistan,"" the Union minister said.

He said that it has become a pattern with Congress to try to provide a shield for Pakistan's terrorism and then seek to disassociate itself from the remarks in the face of controversies. ""Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar claimed that India should be fearful of Pakistan,"" he added.","Home minister Amit Shah said that every inch of PoK belongs to India and no force can snatch it.

In an unusual move, the EC on Friday responded to Kharge's letter to fellow INDIA bloc leaders that was also posted on X, and rejected his allegations.Congress general secretary, Jairam Ramesh said, “EC is a Constitutional body entrusted with the responsibility of being an impartial body that ensures, and is seen to ensure, a level-playing field to all political parties.” “Both the content and intent of the letter will be a permanent blot on the reputation of an institution that can boast of luminaries like Sukumar Sen, TN Seshan, JM Lyngdoh and others,” he said adding that the approach of ECI to addressing these issues is “deeply regrettable”.Addressing the media after the INDIA bloc leaders met the EC, Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi said that they raised two key issues, ""Issue number one was one of great trust deficit and a feeling of alarm and distress that 11 complaints by Congress alone, and more that 15 complaints by all parties put together against the Prime Minister and Home Minister, starting from early April, have not been addressed.""Singhvi said that “if they (EC) don't act promptly, it will be a complete abdication of Constitutional duty.” He also hinted that the opposition parties may approach the Supreme Court with the issue. ""It is no joy for us to go to the Supreme Court and get directions saying why don't you decide. We are distressed and there is no satisfactory answer why these people are not touched,"" he said.Singhvi said they also raised the issue of ""non-publication or publication with extreme delay of the voter turnout percentages."" The delegation raised three points - the difference of voter percentage increase is 5.74% or 5.5%. The comparable figure in the 2019 election in the first three phases was 2%, 1%, 2.5%, this time it is double.The INDIA bloc has demanded that since the “stamp of approval of a published absolute figure and a percentage figure by the EC carries its own constitutional weight” that should be provided.","Congress calls EC’s response to Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge ‘s letter as a “permanent blot” on the face of a body.

India means ‘Mother of democracy’. Today, idea of India is ‘International Yoga Day’, ‘Shiva Shakti point on Moon’. All this that represents the ‘idea of India’ is today not limited to mere customs but represents India’s identity and its voice in the world.”Without taking Pitroda’s name, he said: “The tutor of the shehzada (Rahul) gives him very dangerous ideas. The tutor informed him that construction of a Ram temple is against the idea of India. They even objected to me going to the Ram temple. Tell me, are we traitors to the country? Will you allow this type of disrespect to Lord Ram?”Modi dubbed Congress an ‘anti-Hindu party’ which never cared for the majority community. “Despite knowing that religion-based reservation is unconstitutional and Ambedkar did not support it, they want to bring Muslim reservations across the country like they did in undivided Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. Muslim reservations will pave the way for conversions in the country. Will you allow your quota to be taken away like that?” he said.Recalling that “bomb blasts used to take place in the country during the Congress-led UPA regime”, he said such terror attacks did not take place now and appealed to elderly voters to tell first-time voters in their families about blasts such as the one in Dilsukhnagar in Hyderabad.“In those days, news of blasts used to be everywhere. One family goes to a restaurant for dinner, there would be bomb blast. One family goes to watch a movie in a theatre, there would be bomb blast. Blasts happened while travelling in buses. I want to warn people that voting for Congress would mean sending the country back in the grip of terrorism. They have taken a soft stance on terrorism,” Modi said.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi emphasised that Lord Ram is at the core of ‘my idea of India’ He said that Congress is divorced from the ‘idea of India, which encapsulates civilisational history spanning thousands of years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110019931,imgsize-102424,width-400,resizemode-4/110019931.jpg"

Trinamool-NCW spat over Sandeshkhali reaches Election Commission,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/trinamool-ncw-spat-over-sandeshkhali-reaches-election-commission/articleshow/110020001.cms,"KOLKATA: The Sandeshkhali videos and retraction of rape allegations by two of three “survivors” triggered a fresh row Friday involving Trinamool Congress and National Commission for Women ( NCW ), culminating in the latter writing to Election Commission about West Bengal’s governing party “compelling women to withdraw cases”.The missive to EC came hours after TMC threatened to move the poll panel against NCW chairperson Rekha Sharma for allegedly “forcing and deceiving women from Sandeshkhali into filing fake rape complaints to malign Bengal”.At a TMC presser on Friday, the party demanded a police probe and criminal proceedings against the NCW chief for “misusing her chair” and being “one of the main conspirators” in the Sandeshkhali unrest.Four videos have emerged in the last few days, each suggesting that the rape allegations — or at least some of them — might have been concocted . A video from a purported sting in which BJP’s Sandeshkhali Block-II chief Gangadhar Koyal says the “Sandeshkhali movement” was MLA Suvendu Adhikari's brainchild is among them.There are two other videos, each showing a different “survivor” alleging she had been made to sign a blank sheet of paper, and an older clip featuring BJP's Basirhat candidate Rekha Patra telling a TV channel she suspected some of the “survivors” taken to Delhi to meet President Droupadi Murmu may have been “paid to impersonate”.TMC minister Shashi Panja said, “We will approach EC against the NCW chairperson, who coerced these women to file fake rape complaints. The BJP ecosystem started false stories for political agenda and then brought in various commissions. It is becoming clear now that these commissions were part of the conspiracy .”Sharma refuted the claims. In its letter to the poll panel, NCW alleged that TMC workers were “instilling fear in the minds of Sandeshkhali women and stopping them from coming forward with their complaints and potentially impacting the election process in the area”.The letter urges the EC to investigate the matter “on priority and direct the authorities to take appropriate measures”.“In recent developments surrounding the Sandeshkhali case, NCW has noted that a few women have suddenly taken their complaints back regarding Sheikh Shahjahan. NCW finds this turn of statement deeply concerning, particularly amid the backdrop of the general elections of 2024,” NCW said in a statement.","Four videos have emerged in the last few days, each suggesting that the rape allegations — or at least some of them — might have been concocted.

He has also told the cadres that the PM and BJP are aware that the EC will not act against them for provoking people in the name of religion and caste.Kharge has said the first three phases of voting have seen an overwhelming response for Congress, and there should be extra effort to ensure that BJP does not succeed in distracting the nation’s attention by their bid to raise communal issues in an effort to “divide the poor on religious and caste lines”.Interestingly, in the wake of repeated controversies triggered by comments from party functionaries, Kharge has urged them to be extra careful about what they speak to the press. At the same time, he has asked Congress functionaries, especially seniors, to refrain from speaking on sensitive issues, especially on national security, over which the party stand is already clear.“BJP and its handlers will go to any length to manipulate your words by taking them out of context or by editing your speeches or by manipulating them using technology,” he has said in the missive, forwarded by AICC general secretary K C Venugopal to state units, office-bearers and public representatives. The party has urged the state units to disseminate the instructions down to the grassroots level.While lamenting what he has called the EC’s indulgent attitude towards the governing camp, Kharge advised party functionaries and workers to not worry about the EC’s inaction and to aggressively take the initiative in filing cases against BJP functionaries whenever there is a violation, assuring them that law will catch up with BJP soon.“It is the poor who have suffered the most in the last 10 years due to unemployment and price rise. We should not allow ourselves to be distracted by the efforts of BJP and the PM to communalise this . BJP is now trying to divide the poor on the basis of religion and caste.

Letters to governor

A 'confident' Nayab Saini

Experts' opinion and role of governor

NEW DELHI: The Haryana government , led by Nayab Singh Saini, has been thrown into turmoil after three independent MLAs withdrew their support. This development comes just two months after the BJP ended its alliance with the Jannayak Janata Party (JJP), led by Dushyant Chautala. The BJP also replaced its chief minister, with Saini taking over from Manohar Lal Khattar, as the party faces challenges in the ongoing Lok Sabha polls.The Congress, which gave the BJP a tough fight in the 2019 assembly polls by winning 31 seats compared to the BJP's 40, has gained fresh momentum following the independents' threat to bring down the Nayab Saini government.Although JJP leader Dushyant Chautala claims to have 10 MLAs, six of them have already indicated their separation from Dushyant's party. Even Dushyant may be unaware about the loyalty of his MLAs during a potential floor test. Two of them openly supported BJP candidates in the Lok Sabha polls, while at least three reportedly met Khattar and they might support the current state government.""The opposition is doing vague calculations. During the floor test, if they can retain even 23 of their MLAs, it will be a big deal. I don't see any no-confidence motion being moved anytime soon, but if any such situation arises, we will have a floor test... Many JJP MLAs have given support to BJP. This is what I'm saying, they need to think beyond what meets the eye,"" said Khattar, while talking to news agency ANI.The Haryana assembly, which has 90 members, currently has a strength of 88 after an independent MLA, and former CM Khattar resigned to contest the Lok Sabha election from Karnal. The BJP has 40 MLAs, Congress 30, JJP 10, INLD 1, Gopal Kanda's Haryana Lokhit Party (HLP) 1, and 7 independents. With only 43 MLAs supporting the Nayab Saini government, it has clearly become a minority.Both the Congress and JJP have sought the governor's intervention. Bhupinder Singh Hooda, the leader of the opposition, has requested a meeting with the governor to present a memorandum regarding the current political situation and has called for the imposition of President's Rule . Dushyant Chautala, in his letter, stated that his party does not support the current government and is open to backing any other political party to form a new government. He demanded a floor test to determine the majority of the incumbent government.INLD leader Abhay Chautala demanded imposition of the President’s Rule in the state in case BJP fails to prove its majority in the House.Despite the challenges, Haryana CM Nayab Saini remains confident, citing the vote of confidence he received a month ago. He questioned Dushyant's timing and dismissed his concerns as election-related stress.The current BJP govt seems secure for the time being. As per established rules, a no-confidence motion against a government cannot be initiated within a six-month period following the previous one. The BJP government in Haryana had already faced a no-trust motion in February, making it ineligible for another such challenge at present.However, legislative experts have said that there is no codified rule preventing the introduction of a motion for a floor test in the House. In the current situation, the governor's role becomes crucial, as he can decide on convening the House for the floor test. The Constitution grants the governor the authority to summon, prorogue, and dissolve the state legislative assembly, and the Supreme Court has emphasized the governor's constitutional obligation to act judiciously and impartially in such matters.Haryana governor Bandaru Dattatreya, a native of Andhra Pradesh, was an RSS pracharak until 1989 before joining the BJP. He has served as a Union minister in both the Vajpayee and Modi governments and has been an MP for four terms. In 2019, he was appointed as the governor of Himachal Pradesh and later shifted to Haryana in 2021.The state is scheduled to go to assembly elections in October this year.","Haryana governor Bandaru Dattatreya was an RSS pracharak until 1989.

Lok Sabha elections: Arvind Kejriwal hits trail running with roadshow today,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lok-sabha-elections-arvind-kejriwal-hits-trail-running-with-roadshow-today/articleshow/110024119.cms,"NEW DELHI: The campaign of Aam Aadmi Party and INDIA bloc for Lok Sabha elections in Delhi and other states has got a shot in the arm with Arvind Kejriwal set to join it from Saturday.Given interim bail by Supreme Court solely for the purpose of elections, the Delhi chief minister is losing no time in hitting the campaign trail. He will participate in a roadshow in south Delhi on Saturday along with his Punjab counterpart, Bhagwant Mann.Kejriwal draws big crowds to his public events and will be the star campaigner for his party. In his absence, the party’s Delhi state convener, Gopal Rai, and his cabinet colleagues, Saurabh Bharadwaj and Atishi, had stepped in. His wife Sunita’s roadshows were drawing crowds but couldn’t compare with Kejriwal’s chemistry with audiences.An important constituent of INDIA alliance , AAP has fielded 22 candidates in five states. The party is contesting on four seats in Delhi as part of a seat-sharing arrangement with Congress and on two each in Gujarat and Assam and one in Haryana. It has gone solo in Punjab and is contesting all 13 seats.While voting in Assam and Gujarat is over, Delhi and Chandigarh will go to polls on May 25 and Punjab on June 1. A senior party functionary said Kejriwal is likely to spend most of his time campaigning till May 23 – the last day of campaigning for the sixth phase of elections on May 25 – and will also go to Kurukshetra in Haryana. Since Punjab will go to polls in the seventh phase on June 1, the AAP chief may address rallies and participate in roadshows there after May 23.“To show solidarity with the INDIA bloc, Kejriwal may intermittently go to other states where the alliance partners are giving a tough fight to BJP and campaign for them,” said the party functionary. “We will soon draw up a plan for his campaign after speaking to other alliance partners and keeping their requirements in mind. The leaders of other parties would surely like to come to Delhi and campaign for AAP and Congress here.”The party is also likely to coin a new name for the campaign. After Kejriwal’s release on interim bail, AAP functionaries started using “Modi can’t stop Kejriwal” as a catchphrase.Another AAP functionary said Kejriwal coming out of jail will prove to be a “gamechanger” for the INDIA group. He claimed the Delhi CM is much in demand in other states as well and his joining the alliance partners will bolster their campaign.Minutes after the SC order, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee said in a post on X said it will be “very helpful” in the context of the Lok Sabha polls. NCP (SP) chief Sharad Pawar welcomed SC’s decision, saying, “India remains steadfast in the pursuit of democracy”. Aaditya Thackeray of Shiv Sena (UBT) said justice and relief to Kejriwal against the “dictatorial regime” in the country was a huge sign of winds of change.","Aam Aadmi Party and INDIA bloc for Lok Sabha elections in Delhi and other states has got a shot in the arm with Arvind Kejriwal set to join it from Saturday.

This ride is no forest safari.It is the road to Nadkem, where at least 150 tribals reside.It is the road the children of Nadkem tread by foot to attend school. The hamlet is separated by just a 3-km forest stretch from Karnataka.“During the monsoons, when the water levels in the forest streams rise, the children cannot go to school. None of us can go anywhere,” says Anand Gaonkar, 52, who acts as the de facto village head.Not even an ambulance can get to Nadkem in case of medical emergencies.At this Lok Sabha polls, the villagers have only heard of candidates or parties holding meetings, but no candidate has roughed it out yet to reach them.In the past, candidates like Francisco Sardinha have travelled to Nadkem, but only to seek votes.“They come once and don’t show their faces once elected,” said Anand.There are 137 votes at Nadkem in all, including 59 at Keri, a hamlet worse off, with even no power at the four homes, a one-hour walk uphill from Nadkem.“So many MLAs and MPs have come and gone, but our issues remain. For 20 homes, we have only two toilets, one provided by govt. The nearest hospital is at Chaudi, 25km away. We have no tap water in homes because we were told we would be charged by govt to draw our spring water into the houses,” said another villager, Yeshwant Gaonkar.Their only jobs are as daily wagers.MLA Ramesh Tawadkar, a tribal himself, has promised to construct a road and the villagers remain hopeful.“We had decided to boycott the last zilla panchayat elections. But there are other villages here like Keri and Yeda whose residents decided to vote any way. Later, the mamlatdar and deputy collector urged us to vote too, and the boycott could not achieve its purpose,” said Mahadev Velip.As a result of the boycott probably, the village balwadi was turned into a polling booth and for the first time this Lok Sabha election, Nadkem residents will not have to trek 5-6km through the jungles to cast their vote.The village received an electricity connection in 2012 and streetlights were provided only last Diwali.“For water supply, one common tap has been provided from where the women still have to carry water home every day for the entire family’s requirement. It would make life much easier for us women if the water is supplied to the homes,” said Anand’s wife Amita, who recollects a much more convenient life prior to marriage in her maternal home in Gaondongorim village.Anand’s son has finally managed to complete his graduation, a big feat in the remote village, after his daily-wager father gathered the funds for a rented premises in Canacona.Women due for deliveries too have to be shifted to relatives' homes because Nadkem is no place for emergencies.The village head has now purchased a four-wheeler that acts as the entire hamlet’s emergency service.“How will we leave this village? This is our home. If we could only be provided a road, we would not ask for anything else,” says Anand.","At least 150 tribals live in Nadkem, 100km from Panaji and 25km from Canacona. The hamlet is separated by just a 3-km forest stretch from Karnataka. For 20 homes, we have only two toilets, one provided by govt. The nearest hospital is at Chaudi, 25km away.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110017710,imgsize-305684,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/110017710.jpg"
"Little by little, villagers of Vainguinim dig a road to civilization",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/little-by-little-villagers-of-vainguinim-dig-a-road-to-civilization/articleshow/110017639.cms,"Survival expert Bear Gryll would probably shy away from their everyday lives. The daily routine of the 50-odd residents of Vainguinim is a physical challenge.Sattari, over 50km from Panaji, is considered Goa’s rural taluka. And Vainguinim begins where Sattari nearly ends. It is a mere 5km from the Karnataka border.Only off-roading on a two-wheeler across three streams can take one to this tribal hamlet, inside the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary.Decades of scraping with their own hands have allowed the residents to create this mud road.The state forest department’s recent efforts to even out this path have helped, but there is much more left to be done before these villagers can claim to live a normal life.“Through solar panels on our thatched rooftops, govt provided us with electricity in 2022. But none of the houses have toilets yet. We dug wells on our own to access drinking water. Until 12 years ago, we would use stream water for drinking. With no road, our children must stay with relatives outside the village to study, or they don’t go to school at all,” says Rama Gaonkar.It is not surprising that no Lok Sabha candidate has ever turned up here for campaigning, but that will not stop the villagers from exercising their franchise by walking 5km through the forest to their polling booth at Codal village. “It is our vote, and we have to cast it,” says Laxman Gaonkar.“Road, water, and electricity are what we need. MLA Vishwajit Rane summoned us for a meeting at Satre and has promised to meet our demands. Things will improve gradually, as they have since our childhood,” says Yesso Gaonkar.While the adults of the village live outside Vainguinim for daily-wage jobs, the elderly remain cut off from the world during the monsoon as water in the streams rises.“If someone falls ill, they will have to die with no medical treatment,” says Rama. “If possible, the sick are taken pillion on bikes. Cellphones have been a boon. At least someone can be summoned with a bike. Until 15 years ago, there was no road, and there was no way to get here.”Rama’s son has been fortunate to have earned a priced govt job in the police department, and that has provided hope to others, like Rajendra Gaonkar. They seek daily-wage jobs to afford the rent to live in Valpoi so that their children can complete their graduation.“Those with children have to stay on rent and work for daily wages so that the kids can go to school. There is no way to attend school if we stay in Vainguinim. If you live in the village, betelnut and cashew are the only other sources of income,” says Rajendra, who has two sons.Hope is their best bet.","Vainguinim, over 50km from Panaji, is considered Goa’s rural taluka.

"As taps run dry in arid Aurangabad, candidates go on and on about booze",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/as-taps-run-dry-in-arid-aurangabad-candidates-go-on-and-on-about-booze/articleshow/110021570.cms,"CHHATRAPATI SAMBHAJINAGAR: In the heart of Maharashtra lies Aurangabad , a city grappling with parched throats and dry taps. However, the talk here isn't about quenching thirst but spirits of a different kind. As the political arena heats up, liquor has become the toast of conversations, overshadowing even the most pressing issues - the chronic water scarcity plaguing the region.It began when CM Eknath Shinde's Shiv Sena named Sandipan Bhumare as the candidate for Aurangabad - the Lok Sabha seat retains the old name of the city, now known as Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar. Bhumare's rivals wasted no time in levelling accusations against him, alleging that he owns nine liquor shops in Paithan, a charge he vehemently denies.As the mudslinging intensifies, Bhumare advises his opponents to peruse his poll affidavit, where he claims his wife is the owner of two liquor shops. ""The details are clearly outlined in my affidavit, readily available to everyone. I dutifully pay taxes for the establishments,"" he says.Deputy CM Ajit Pawar, an adversary turned ally now with BJP-led Mahayuti, previously spearheaded the attack against Bhumare when he was in the undivided NCP. However, in the shifting landscape of alliances, where partnerships are as fleeting as shadows at dusk, Ajit's voice has faded into silence, but others carry on the onslaught against Bhumare's alleged liquor empire.The Sena faction under Uddhav Thackeray has been particularly vocal, labelling Bhumare a ""liquor baron"". Sena (UBT) candidate Chandrakant Khaire emphasised his own track record at a recent rally, saying, ""I served as an MP for 20 years, always with a clear priority. While my opponent held the MLA position for five terms, his attention seemed fixed on opening liquor shops. The choice lies with you, the people.""Even All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi has composed a catchy jingle borrowed from Aziz Nazan's iconic qawwali often heard in dive bars - it goes something like ""Jhoom re, Bhumare; jhoom barabar jhoom re.""Amid this cacophony, voters lament that the sparring over liquor, rather than the water crisis, is a ""mockery of democracy"". As the blame game ensues over delayed water projects, voters are disillusioned with the circus.Renuka Beedkar, a homemaker, remarked, ""Neither the ruling Mahayuti nor the opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) addresses the water woes in our so-called metropolis. Opting for NOTA seems the only way to express our exasperation.""Swapnil Bhoomkar, a resident of Padegaon, said they have to rely on borewells and private tankers. ""We shell out a small fortune every week for water. Our predicament surpasses even that people in rural areas face.""There's a triangular contest in Aurangabad this cycle. In 2019, Imtiaz Jaleel of AIMIM surprised analysts with a razor-thin victory by 4,492 votes, expanding the party's footprint beyond Telangana.Five years on, he anticipates another multi-cornered battle that may fragment non-minorities votes. However, unlike the previous , AIMIM is without the support of Prakash Ambedkar-led Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi, which has fielded its own nominee, Afsar Khan.Jaleel, however, remains confident in his ability to bridge divides and serve all constituents, irrespective of religion. He places his confidence in his endeavours, particularly in bolstering public health infrastructure in the area. ""It wasn't just Muslims, but also Hindus and people from other communities who backed me in the previous elections. I delivered on their expectations and fostered unity instead of discord.""Among the six assembly segments in the LS seat, three are held by Shiv Sena and two by BJP, providing an edge to Bhumare, who was selected over Maratha activist Vinod Patil. Says Bhumare, ""The nation is experiencing rapid progress under PM Narendra Modi. Once again, the voters of Aurangabad will stand with him, and thus, they will elect me to the Lok Sabha.""Meanwhile, for Khaire, a seasoned campaigner, this marks his last stand. With the backing of former corporators and a section of workers, Khaire hopes to reclaim his seat, banking on past achievements and party loyalty. Despite the party split, the Sena (UBT) candidate still garners support from a group of former corporators and a segment of workers.He also relies on the endorsement of the leader of the opposition in the council, Ambadas Danve. Notably, Danve had eyed a Lok Sabha ticket but reluctantly accepted the party's decision. ""My defeat in the previous polls was an anomaly. I trust that the people will choose me once more,"" he says.Yet, the political arena extends beyond the primary contenders. Former Kannad MLA Harshwardhan Jadhav, now an Independent candidate, seeks to disrupt the prevailing order. Additionally, with Prakash Ambedkar's Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi fielding Afsar Khan, the stage is primed for an ideological showdown.As the campaign intensifies, Ambedkar's call for change resonates with many disenchanted voters. Amid the rhetoric and promises, one undeniable reality persists: water, not liquor, is the lifeblood of Aurangabad. As Monday's poll approaches, the spotlight intensifies on Aurangabad, a city torn between thirst for change and intoxicating allure of status quo.","Sandipan Bhumare is the Shiv Sena's candidate for Aurangabad Lok Sabha seat.

"Low turnout, not BJP, Owaisi’s biggest worry",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/low-turnout-not-bjp-owaisis-biggest-worry/articleshow/110024280.cms,"Most parties leave

BJP main target this time

Falling turnout a concern

BJP very much in this race

HYDERABAD: Hyderabad Lok Sabha seat has been an Owaisi family bastion since 1984, and a fifth win here would put Asaduddin Owaisi ahead of his father, Sultan Salahuddin Owaisi, who represented it for 20 years until 2004.Asad has won every election here with a huge margin, representing AIMIM , the party his father joined after winning his first seat as an Independent.He’s also become the Muslim community’s most visible and vocal face in his 20 years as MP. But the triangular contest with BJP and Congress might not be so easy this time. Although 60% of Hyderabad constituency is Muslim, and Asad is the front-runner, he’s up against BJP’s K Madhavi Latha, who revels in controversy, and Congress’s Mohammad Waliullah Sameer, who might split Asad’s Muslim votes .Him Alone Political observers say AIMIM keeps winning Hyderabad because it projects itself as the voice of weaker sections, especially Muslims, in 45 Telangana assembly seats where they make up 8-20% of the population.Other parties, which need these Muslim votes, go easy in Hyderabad to keep AIMIM on their side. In fact, local Congress leaders complain cosying up to AIMIM since the days of undivided Andhra has almost finished their party in the old city of Hyderabad, and their leaders and cadres are not encouraged to put up a strong contest.It’s not that Congress and Telugu Desam Party, which governed undivided Andhra at different times, didn’t try to challenge AIMIM (Congress last won the seat in 1980), but they soon realised it was better to keep the party on their side by leaving 7-8 assembly segments and one Lok Sabha constituency for it. And AIMIM mostly confined itself to the old city, barring a few occasions when the party in office rubbed it the wrong way. For example, AIMIM-Congress ties turned sour after the events that unfolded from Nov 2012 to Jan 2013. When five AIMIM MLAs were placed in preventive custody over the Charminar-Bhagyalakshmi temple issue, and Asad’s younger brother Akbaruddin Owaisi was arrested for an alleged hate speech, AIMIM sided with K Chandrasekhar Rao-led Bharat Rashtra Samithi (then TRS). This bonhomie lasted until BRS lost the 2023 assembly elections.This time, the talk is that Asad and Akbar are extending seat-wise support to the party — BRS or Congress — that’s in a position to defeat BJP. In fact, Asad has declared that their main objective is to defeat BJP. Outside Telangana, however, AIMIM candidates will take on Congress and other parties in some seats. The AIMIM-Congress patch-up started after Congress got only four seats over the half-way mark in Telangana. State Congress president and now chief minister A Revanth Reddy extended an olive branch to AIMIM by laying the foundation stone for metro rail works in old Hyderabad and promising overall development. Owaisi responded by assuring that his seven MLAs would back Congress if it lost majority.Then, Akbar and Revanth hit it off in London in Jan while visiting the Thames river project, in the backdrop of the CM’s plan to revive Musi river that flows through Hyderabad. The proposed Musi riverfront development would cost Rs 50,000 crore.He has the alignments worked out, but Asad still needs to worry about voter fatigue and his seat’s falling turnout. In 1999, when his father last contested, 69.2% of the electorate voted, but in 2019 the number plummeted to 44.8%, despite AIMIM cadres pleading with people to go out and vote. Nobody knows for sure why Hy derabadis have become ballot-shy. Experts say it might be that Muslims expect Asad to win, whether they vote or not. Or they may be disheartened, feeling their vote makes no difference nationally.So, Asad has been campaigning relentlessly through the streets of the old city, riding his Triumph Bonneville bike sometimes, and walking through the narrow lanes on others. He tells people to not stay home on voting day, for their safety.While it has never won Hyderabad, BJP does have a big presence here. Its candidates have finished second in four out of five Lok Sabha elections to this seat, with decent vote shares, while Congress has always finished third or fourth. BJP’s Bhagwant Rao got 32.1% of the votes polled in 2014, and 26.8% in 2019. Experts say this is because sharp rhetoric from AIMIM and BJP leaders has deeply divided the Hyderabad electorate. The seat’s Goshamahal assembly segment is a bastion of T Raha Singh, BJP’s most aggressive Hindutva face in the city. The party once suspended him along with Nupur Sharma for comments on Prophet Mohammed. On the other side, Akbar has a police case against him for threatening an inspector who told him campaign time was over.","Asad has won every election here with a huge margin, representing AIMIM.

Andhra Pradesh high court pulls up Election Commission over cash benefit transfer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/amaravati/andhra-pradesh-high-court-pulls-up-election-commission-over-cash-benefit-transfer/articleshow/110018735.cms,"VIJAYAWADA: The Andhra Pradesh high court on Friday pulled up the Election Commission of India (ECI) for seeking clarification from the AP state govt over disbursal of amount under various welfare schemes even after its directions. The high court questioned lack of uniformity in ECI orders pertaining to welfare schemes in different states. However, the high court did not grant any relief to the state govt and posted the matter for further hearing after summer vacation.The state govt and a few beneficiaries of welfare schemes moved the high court challenging the directions issued by the ECI refraining the govt from depositing money into the accounts of beneficiaries of various schemes.After a day-long hearing over the petitions, the high court had on Thursday kept the directions of ECI in abeyance for one day till May 10. The high court, however, directed the state govt not to deposit any money from May 11 till May 13.The high court had further directed the state govt not to publicise in any form about depositing money into the accounts of beneficiaries. Challenging the single judge orders, Navataram Party moved an appeal petition on Friday and pressed for urgent hearing by way of lunch motion.Arguing on behalf of the petitioner, senior counsels NS Nadkarni and Meenakshi Arora said that the single judge orders are unusual. While ordering the state govt not to deposit money from May 11 till May 13, the single judge facilitated the govt to deposit the amounts on May 10 which is nothing but vitiating the level playing field. They have said that the orders of a single judge are in favour of the ruling party and against the interest of opposition parties contesting the election. Allowing the govt to deposit Rs 14000 crore of money, two days before the polling would give undue advantage to the ruling dispensation, they have said.Arguing on behalf of the state govt, advocate general S Sriram said that the govt has sought no objection certificate (NOC) from ECI after the single judge orders. Without giving the NOC, the ECI has raised further clarifications. The chief secretary has submitted an explanation to the queries raised by the ECI. However, as the NOC is not granted by the ECI, the govt could not deposit the money into the accounts of beneficiaries, he said.Sriram further said that the ECI has violated the orders of the single judge by not giving NOC. He said that in 2019, the ECI allowed the then govt to give post-dated cheques to the beneficiaries but this time took a contrarian view on the same issue. He said that an in-depth hearing is required on the contrarian decisions taken by the ECI and requested to keep the appeal petitions open.Arguing on behalf of the ECI, senior counsel Avinash Desai said that the single judge neither said to deposit money into the accounts of beneficiaries nor mentioned any reasons for giving such orders. He said that the ECI has clarified that the schemes can be implemented after the polling date. The ECI has sought additional clarifications from the govt for issuing of NOC.The high court bench headed by Chief Justice Dheeraj Singh Thakur and Justice R Raghunandan Rao asked ECI as to why it has chosen to sit on single judge orders instead of filing an appeal if it has any apprehensions over the same. The bench asked as to why the ECI sought clarifications from govt even after the orders of the high court. The bench asked whether the ECI thinks that it is above the high court.However, the bench observed that no further orders need to be passed as the govt has in any case not disbursed the amount for want of clearance from the ECI and in the disbursal of amount will not take place on Friday. As the single judge orders will come into force from Saturday refraining the govt from depositing the amounts till May 13, on May 14 the amount may be disbursed as submitted by the ECI, said the high court and posted the matters for further hearing on September 2.",The high court questioned lack of uniformity in ECI orders pertaining to welfare schemes in different states.

Pakistan SC suspends Peshawar HC order denying reserved seats to Imran-backed party,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-sc-suspends-peshawar-hc-order-denying-reserved-seats-to-imran-backed-party/articleshow/109898987.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s Supreme Court suspended on Monday a high court verdict that a political party aligned with candidates backed by incarcerated former prime minister Imran Khan was not eligible for reserved seats for women and minorities in the national and provincial legislatures.Since the Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) was barred by the top court from contesting the Feb 8 elections under its traditional electoral symbol of a cricket bat on technical grounds, the party had subsequently struck an alliance with another party, Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), in an attempt to secure reserved seats in parliament.Under Pakistan’s election rules, political parties are allotted reserved seats — (there are 60 for women and 10 for minorities in the National Assembly) — in proportion to the number of parliamentary seats they win in the election. This completes the NA’s total strength of 336 seats.In March, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had ruled that SIC was not eligible for reserved seats and decided to distribute the seats among other parliamentary parties, with the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) becoming major beneficiaries. The verdict was rejected by PTI as unconstitutional and the alliance had filed a plea against the electoral watchdog’s decision in the Peshawar HC, but it rejected the appeal.In response, SIC moved the Supreme Court last month urging it to allot the party the reserved seats in the national and provincial assemblies and set aside the Peshawar HC ruling.Accepting SIC’s appeal for a hearing, the apex court clarified that the Peshawar HC order upholding ECP’s decision was suspended to the extent of the remaining reserved seats distributed among other parties.After losing the extra reserved seats, PM Shehbaz Sharif’s coalition government had lost its two-thirds majority in the National Assembly.","Pakistan’s Supreme Court suspended on Monday a high court verdict that a political party was not eligible for reserved seats for women and minorities.
