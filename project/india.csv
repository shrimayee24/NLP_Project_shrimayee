"Bihar elections: Smallest member of opposition bloc, but with victory under its belt",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-elections-smallest-member-of-opposition-bloc-but-with-victory-under-its-belt/articleshow/125374479.cms,"Bihar Assembly Poll Results: NDA Touches 200-Seat Lead, Congress Intensifies SIR, Vote Chori Attacks

NEW DELHI: The smallest member of Mahagathbandhan in Bihar has made its presence felt in an otherwise trainwreck of an election for the opposition. In a state crowded with sub-regional satraps who are identified with their castes, I P Gupta of Indian Inclusive Party has come into the limelight by successfully mobilising members of castes that have long been on the margins.Gupta (55) won from Saharsa by defeating his BJP rival by over 2,000 votes, marking a successful electoral debut for his party which had contested three seats as an MGB constituent.It was an outcome that eluded better-known parties helmed by much bigger names. Jan Suraaj Party of Prashant Kishor and Vikashsheel Insaan Party of Mukesh Sahani, the latter an RJD ally like Gupta, are two such examples. While Kishor fielded candidates in over 235 seats, VIP contested 12. Both parties drew a blank.Gupta quit Congress in 2023 to champion the cause of Tanti-Tatwa, which falls under Extremely Backward Classes and is estimated to be 1-2% of the population, and pushed for a separate quota for them along with members of the Paan community. He blamed the state's NDA govt for the Supreme Court verdict that had overturned the move to grant SC quota to Tanti-Tatwa (historically weavers) and put the community back in the EBC category.He showed a knack for mobilisation by organising a successful rally in Patna's huge Gandhi Maidan in April, coming to the notice of parties of all hues in the election year. He said he was contacted by formations from across the political spectrum, from NDA to AIMIM and MGB, before he reached a deal with the opposition alliance. He held meetings with Rahul Gandhi and Tejashwi Yadav and accused NDA of trying to sabotage his politics while holding talks with him.An engineer who ran a business before plunging into politics, Gupta's stock is likely to rise in a state where mobilisation along caste lines is central to political shifts.","I P Gupta of Indian Inclusive Party has come into the limelight by successfully mobilising members of castes that have long been on the margins.

'Disowned Tejashwi': Rohini says father stands by her; Lalu Yadav family feud gets murky,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/disowned-tejashwi-rohini-says-father-stands-by-her-lalu-yadav-family-feud-gets-murky/articleshow/125365403.cms,"‘Nitish Still X-Factor’ Pavan Verma Decodes Why Jan Suraaj Couldn’t Break Through in Bihar Polls

Rohini jo bolti hai, sach bolti hai

NEW DELHI: Rohini Acharya, daughter of Rashtriya Janata Dal ( RJD ) chief Lalu Prasad Yadav , on Sunday recounted what she says unfolded during the family feud that erupted after the Mahagathbandhan’s crushing defeat in the Bihar assembly elections, stressing that she is “not lying about any of the events. ”She added that her parents — former Bihar chief ministers Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi — as well as her sisters “cried” for her following Saturday’s developments.“Whatever I had to say, I have already said on my social media. I have not lied about anything that happened.(Whatever Rohini says is the truth). You may go and ask Tejashwi Yadav , Sanjay Yadav, Rachel Yadav, and Rameez. My father has always stood by me. My parents and my sisters were crying for me yesterday. I am blessed to have parents like them,” she told reporters.Rachel Yadav is Acharya’s sister-in-law — her brother Tejashwi's wife, who adopted the name Rajshree after their marriage. Sanjay Yadav and Rameez Nemat have been accused by Rohini of being behind the events that made her “disown” her family and quit politics. Sanjay Yadav is a close confidante of Tejashwi and an RJD Rajya Sabha MP.Rameez, also an RJD leader and Tejashwi’s childhood friend, is the son-in-law of Rizwan Zaheer, a former MP from the Balrampur Lok Sabha seat in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh.“I feel fortunate to have parents like mine. In a family, why is it that only daughters are expected to make sacrifices, especially when there are brothers? When questions were asked of the brothers, they told me to go to my in-laws’ house. As a result, I have decided to disown my brother (Tejashwi),” she added.The former RJD leader mentioned that she is now heading to Mumbai to stay with her mother-in-law. “She is worried and has been crying since yesterday,” Acharya noted.On Saturday, a day after the results were declared and the RJD and its allies suffered a rout — dashing Tejashwi Yadav’s hopes of becoming the third chief minister from the family — Rohini Acharya announced on social media that she was “disowning” her family and quitting politics. She blamed Sanjay Yadav and Rameez Nemach for the situation.“Yesterday, a daughter, a sister, a married woman, a mother was humiliated; abuses were hurled, shoes were raised to kill her… I did not compromise on my self-respect, I did not give up on truth… and because of that, I faced insults. Yesterday, a daughter left her crying parents and siblings out of helplessness… she was forced to leave her parental home… she was made an orphan. I pray that none of you ever have to walk my path, and no home should ever have a daughter-sister like Rohini,” she wrote on X earlier on Sunday.","Rohini Acharya, daughter of Rashtriya Janata Dal ( RJD ) chief Lalu Prasad Yadav, on Sunday recounted what she says unfolded during the family feud.

BJD cries foul after Nuapada defeat: Party alleges booth rigging; cites high voter turnout,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjd-cries-foul-after-nuapada-defeat-party-alleges-booth-rigging-cites-high-voter-turnout/articleshow/125367242.cms,"Snehangini Chhuria with Naveen Patnaik (File photo)

NEW DELHI: BJD on Sunday rejected the Nuapada by-poll results after finishing third behind the BJP and the Congress, accusing the Election Commission of India of failing to stop “rigging” by the ruling BJP.The by-poll was held after the death of the sitting BJD MLA. His son, Jay Dholakia, was expected to contest as the BJD candidate but switched to the BJP and became its nominee. The BJD then fielded its women’s wing chief, Snehangini Chhuria.At a press conference at the party headquarters, Chhuria said, “I completely reject the Nuapada by-poll results and condemn the ECI and the district administration for failing to conduct a free and fair election.”Dholakia won the seat with over 1.23 lakh votes. Congress candidate Ghasiram Majhi came second with 40,121 votes, and Chhuria finished third with 38,408 votes.Chhuria alleged that the BJP “manipulated” the election using administrative machinery and police support. She claimed the Nuapada district collector, the district election officer, and the SP acted like “BJP agents” and failed to act on complaints of electoral malpractice. She also said the high voter turnout in 41 booths, crossing 90 per cent for the first time, was “suspicious”.Also read: Bihar polls similar to those seen in North Korea, Russia & China, says Digvijaya Singh She accused the ECI of changing voter turnout figures multiple times.According to her, the commission first announced 75 per cent turnout at 5 pm on 14 November, later raised it to 77 per cent, then 81 per cent the next morning, and finally revised it to 83.45 per cent.Chhuria said the BJP gained from “rigging” carried out with help from local officials. She claimed that BJD leaders followed the ECI’s 48-hour silence rule and left the district, but BJP leaders stayed back and “distributed money”.She also alleged that a BJD worker who filed a complaint was detained under the Arms Act, while complaints about BJP workers entering booths were ignored.BJP general secretary Biranchi Tripathy rejected all allegations and said the BJD should “introspect” instead of questioning the voters’ decision.""The BJD should realise that the people of Odisha have now completely lost faith in them. For the first time, the entire election process was conducted under full CCTV surveillance, so the opposition's allegations carry no truth,"" news agency PTI quoted Tripathy as saying.","BJD accuses Election Commission of failing to stop 'rigging' by the ruling BJP.

Kerala BLO's suicide triggers unrest: Unions call statewide boycott; family blames SIR-related job stress,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kerala-blos-suicide-triggers-unrest-unions-call-statewide-boycott-family-blames-sir-related-job-stress/articleshow/125365815.cms,"EC To Launch SIR in 12 States and UTs in Phase 2, CEC Gyanesh Kumar Says Zero Complaints in Bihar

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: The Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of Kerala’s electoral roll is expected to be severely affected on Monday after multiple trade unions announced that Booth Level Officers (BLOs) across the state will boycott work. The decision follows the death of a BLO in Kannur, whose family and colleagues allege he was under intense work pressure linked to the SIR process.The Action Council of State Government Employees and Teachers, the Joint Committee of Teacher Service Organisations, and the Kerala NGO Association said on Sunday that their members would not report for duty. They have also announced joint protest marches at the office of the Chief Electoral Officer and at collectorates in all districts.According to the organisations, BLOs are burdened with unrealistic targets as part of the SIR and the preparations for the upcoming local body elections. “Instead, it imposed an unrealistic workload with high targets in a very short period. This pressure is pushing BLOs toward suicide,” their statement said.Tension escalated after the death of Aneesh George, 44, a BLO from Payyannur, Kannur, who was found hanging in his home on Sunday.His family and local residents have alleged that he took the extreme step due to the heavy workload associated with the SIR. Police records also state he had been under stress related to his duties.His father said George had been tense for days. “I never expected that things would reach this level… He took the extreme step out of this tension,” he said. A family acquaintance, Shyam, also said the deceased had spoken about the pressure to complete SIR-related work.Leader of Opposition V D Satheesan demanded a thorough probe, saying the workload faced by BLOs must be examined. “SIR was initiated by the central government. The ongoing process is more intensive than even the preparations for the Assembly elections,” he said.CPI(M)’s M V Jayarajan said George “might have felt that there was no option other than to end his own life,” and urged that the SIR be halted until the local body polls. Congress leader Rijil Makkutty alleged that George was a victim of the Election Commission’s attempt to advance the process “to fulfil the BJP agenda”.Chief Electoral Officer Rathan U Kelkar said a report from the district collector has been sought. He added that BLOs are only required to handle SIR-related work for 31 days and “normally there is no chance of any work pressure”. The police probe and collector’s report, he said, will clarify the circumstances.","Multiple trade unions announce that Booth Level Officers (BLOs) across the state will boycott work.
