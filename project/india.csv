"Complaint filed against Sonia, Rahul, and Priyanka Gandhi over remarks on President Murmu",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/complaint-filed-against-sonia-rahul-and-priyanka-gandhi-over-remarks-on-president-murmu/articleshow/117852946.cms,"NEW DELHI: A complaint has been filed against Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra over remarks made about President Droupadi Murmu. The complaint, lodged by Muzaffarpur-based lawyer Sudhir Ojha, accuses them of disrespecting India's highest constitutional authority and seeks legal action under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS). The case will be heard in a Bihar court on 10 February.The controversy erupted following Sonia Gandhi’s comment after the President’s address to Parliament to mark the beginning of the Budget session. Speaking to reporters, the former Congress chief remarked, “The President was getting very tired by the end… she could hardly speak, poor thing.” Rahul Gandhi, in a separate clip, dismissed the speech as “boring,” while Priyanka Gandhi Vadra was also present during the exchange.The Rashtrapati Bhavan responded strongly, calling the remarks “unacceptable” and asserting that Murmu was not tired. In an official statement, the President’s office said, “Some prominent leaders of the Congress party have made comments that clearly hurt the dignity of the high office, and therefore are unacceptable.” The statement further clarified that Murmu was fully composed throughout her speech and that speaking for marginalised communities “can never be tiring.”The remarks triggered a sharp political backlash, with the BJP launching an all-out attack against the Congress. Prime Minister Narendra Modi accused the party’s “shahi parivar” (royal family) of insulting Murmu, a tribal leader. Speaking at a rally in Delhi, he said, “One member called her speech ‘boring,’ and another went further, calling her ‘poor’ and ‘tired.’ This is an insult to 10 crore tribal brothers and sisters and every poor person who has risen from the ground.” BJP chief JP Nadda also criticised Sonia Gandhi’s choice of words, calling them “deeply disrespectful.”Several NDA ministers demanded an apology from Sonia Gandhi, with Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju leading the charge. “The Congress must apologise to the nation and the President for this insult,” Rijiju said.Congress leaders, however, defended Sonia Gandhi, alleging that the BJP was twisting her words for political gain. Party president Mallikarjun Kharge countered by pointing out that the government had disrespected President Murmu by not inviting her to the inauguration of the new Parliament building and the Ram temple in Ayodhya. “The BJP had deliberately kept our current President and the previous President away from these historic moments,” Kharge said.Priyanka Gandhi also came to her mother’s defence, insisting that Sonia Gandhi had the “utmost respect” for Murmu and that her comments were being misrepresented. “My mother simply said that the President must have been tired after such a long speech. It is unfortunate that the media twisted her words,” she stated.As the political storm intensifies, the Bihar court’s decision on 10 February will determine the legal course of action against the Congress leaders. Meanwhile, the controversy continues to be a focal point in the BJP’s ongoing campaign against the opposition.","Complaint filed against Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.

"Most pro-middle class Budget in history, says PM Modi",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/most-pro-middle-class-budget-in-history-says-pm-modi/articleshow/117870756.cms,"NEW DELHI: Exuding confidence about BJP 's prospects in Delhi polls, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the Union Budget presented a day earlier ""the most pro-middle class in India's history"", highlighted measures announced by the finance minister and wooed govt employees by pointing to the announcement of the new Pay Commission.""See you at the victory celebrations on Feb 8,"" Modi said, as he addressed a public meeting, his last before the polls, in the middle-class colony of R K Puram on Sunday, claiming that AAP was headed for a defeat. ""Today is Basant Panchami. With Basant Panchami, the weather starts to change. In three days, on Feb 5, a new spring of development is about to arrive in Delhi. AAP-da party of Delhi has ruined the last 11 years here. Now, let's not allow them to ruin the next five years,"" he said.In a hardsell of the middle class-friendly budget, Modi said, ""Earlier, the country's hard-earned money went into scams, and a few people pocketed it. But BJP govt is dedicating this budget for the welfare of citizens. To build a 'Viksit Bharat', I gave guarantees to strengthen four key pillars - farmers, youth, poor and women. This budget ensures that my guarantees are fulfilled.""He made a jibe at AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal who is engaged in an outreach to the middle class . ""Those who live in 'Sheesh Mahal' can't relate to the jhuggis of the poor or the 2BHKs of the middle classs,"" he said.Stating that only BJP respected the middle class, Modi said, ""I want to present a picture to you. If you earned Rs 12 lakh during the time of Nehru, the govt would take back one-fourth of your salary as tax. Under Indira Gandhi's govt, Rs 2 lakh of it would go in taxes. Even 10-12 years ago, under Congress govt, if you earned Rs 12 lakh, you would have to return Rs 2,60,000. But now, under BJP govt, someone earning Rs 12 lakh won't have to pay a single rupee in extra tax.""Modi also made a pitch for govt employees who are an important part of the electorate in the South Delhi constituency. ""After the setting up of the 8th Pay Commission, salaries of govt employees and who help me implement plans for the development and pensions of those who have retired, are going to rise.""Targeting AAP, the PM accused the party of spreading falsehoods. ""No jhuggis will be demolished in Delhi and no welfare schemes will be shut if BJP comes to office,"" he said, as the crowd erupted in cheers. The air was filled with chants of 'Modi hai toh mumkin hai' and 'Bharat Mata ki jai'.Calling Kejriwal's party AAP-da (disaster) once again, the PM said, ""Even before voting in Delhi, the jhaadu (AAP symbol) is falling apart as AAP-da leaders are abandoning it, realising the growing discontent among the people.""""People from AAP-da even indulge in scams with your treatment and medicine... they loot you. I promise, those who looted Delhi will have to return what they've taken. AAP has given Delhi diseases - pollution is causing harm, respiratory diseases are on the rise, and look at the state of the Yamuna. There is no section of society that hasn't been negatively impacted. The BJP govt will bring an end to all of this. This is Modi's guarantee,"" he added.In the middle of the address, the PM paused twice to admire sketches made by children in the crowd. The kids were holding up their artwork for him, prompting him to ask them their names and addresses so he could write to them.Reaching out to people from Poorvanchal, the PM said, ""Poorvanchalis made me an MP, they also made me the PM. But AAP and Congress have a problem with them. They work in Delhi and contribute to its development. But when Covid hit, AAP spread lies and forced our brothers and sisters from Poorvanchal to leave Delhi. The BJP govt will support the people of Poorvanchal in every possible way.""","PM Narendra Modi addressed a public meeting, his last before the polls, in the middle-class colony of R K Puram on Sunday.
