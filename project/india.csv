LG invites Omar Abdullah to take oath as CM Wednesday,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lg-invites-omar-abdullah-to-take-oath-as-cm-wednesday/articleshow/114231381.cms,"SRINAGAR: J&K lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha invited National Conference (NC) vice president Omar Abdullah to take oath at 11.30am Wednesday as the first CM since the state became a Union territory in 2019.Monday’s invitation followed the Centre’s decision to revoke six years of President’s rule in J&K after the collapse of PDP-BJP govt in 2018. “I am pleased to invite you to form and lead the govt of J&K,” Sinha said in his letter, informing that he received a communication on Oct 11 from NC president Farooq Abdullah confirming Omar’s unanimous election as leader of the legislature party.Sources said Omar is set to be sworn in along with a council of at least nine other members.Though the names of the ministers are yet to be announced, sources said the ministry is likely to include at least one independent MLA. NC spokesperson and MLA Tanveer Sadiq said: “It is the prerogative of the CM to choose his council. It is not wise to speculate about the new cabinet.”Omar will lead a coalition govt, with NC holding 42 seats, Congress six, one each from CPM and AAP, and support from five independent MLAs — making up 55 legislators in the 95-member assembly, which consists of 90 elected and five nominated members.The LG also received letters of support from J&K Congress president Tariq Hameed Karra, CPM secretary GN Malik, AAP national secretary Pankaj Kumar Gupta, and independent MLAs Payare Lal Sharma, Satish Sharma, Choudhury Mohammad Akram, Rameshwar Singh, and Muzafar Iqbal Khan.AAP is lobbying for a cabinet berth for Mehraj Malik, its lone MLA who defeated BJP’s Ganjay Singh Rana in Doda. “We have appealed to the alliance partners to ensure our MLA is given a space in govt,” AAP MP Sanjay Singh said Monday.The appeal followed AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal’s visit to Doda, where he expressed gratitude to the people for electing Malik as the party’s first MLA in J&K.J&K Congress chief Karra said restoration of statehood, land rights, and job-related issues are more important than seeking ministerial positions in the Omar-led govt. “We have not yet discussed the distribution of ministerial berths with NC,” he said.This will be 54-year-old Omar’s second stint as CM, having first held the position in 2009 when the NC-Congress alliance formed a govt.However, unlike his previous tenure, Omar must now operate under a centralised governance structure where the LG controls crucial areas such as police, public order, the transfer of officials, and the power to nominate five assembly members.The changes limit the elected govt’s autonomy, raising concerns about the ability to deliver on campaign promises, including job creation, free electricity, and food distribution. “The LG’s extensive powers — far greater than those in other Union territories — will complicate governance,” a political analyst said.While senior NC member Aga Syed Ruhullah Mehdi said the party will continue advocating for the restoration of J&K’s statehood and special status, Omar might opt to defer these demands to avoid friction with BJP-led central govt, sources said.",J&K lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha invited National Conference (NC) vice president Omar Abdullah to take oath at 11.30am Wednesday as the first CM since the state became a Union territory in 2019.

Haryana elections: Ties worsen as Congress claims AAP-BJP plot for farm crisis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ties-worsen-as-congress-claims-aap-bjp-plot-for-farm-crisis/articleshow/114228004.cms,"NEW DELHI: The relationship between Congress and AAP, which were already strained following the Haryana poll results, worsened with Congress accusing the Bhagwant Mann-led govt in Punjab of conspiring with BJP govt at the Centre to trigger a ""crisis"" in regards to the storing of paddy crop which could potentially destroy the state's economy. Leader of the opposition in the Punjab assembly Partap Singh Bajwa also claimed Mann misled farmers to use hybrid varieties of paddy which was also responsible for the situation.""I hold Arvind Kejriwal, Mann and central govt responsible for this crisis, which will also create a law and order situation,"" Bajwa said at a press conference in New Delhi. He sought the immediate intervention of the Centre, alleging that 185 lakh metric tonne of paddy was expected to arrive in mandis (markets) but there was no space available in godowns across the state, as previous stocks had not been cleared.Bajwa alleged the CM, like a ""brand ambassador"", propagated the use of PR-126 and similar hybrid varieties of paddy which farmers sowed at his instance ultimately leading to the present crisis.""Now it has been revealed that this variety yields about 5kg less rice per quintal after milling, as compared to traditional varieties. This will cause losses to rice millers to the tune of Rs 6,000 crore. They refuse to mill the paddy till they are compensated,"" Bajwa said and asked who will compensate the millers.He referred to the issue of commission for the 'arhtiyas' (commission agents). He said the arhtiyas were protesting and refusing to purchase the produce in the mandis.Congress's attack on AAP and BJP for allegedly waking up too late to speed up procurement and clear stocks came on the same day Mann met Union food minister Pralhad Joshi in Delhi. Bajwa cautioned of an ""impending agrarian crisis that could spiral out of control"".Bajwa said Mann should have met PM Narendra Modi and Joshi six months ago. Making accusations of a ""well thought out conspiracy"" by BJP and Mann, Bajwa alleged that the crisis was being created with an intention to force farmers to go for distress sale and help the industrial house of Adani buy the produce at cheap prices as ""he has massive storage capacity with silos in Moga, Raikot and Kathunangal in Punjab"".Accusing Mann of playing a double game, Bajwa alleged, ""He is inexperienced... he is a stand-up comedian, Punjab is paying a price for it. His one hand is with Kejriwal and the other with home ministry."" He alleged Mann was powerless and the Punjab govt was run from Delhi by Kejriwal.",Congress accuses Bhagwant Mann-led govt in Punjab of conspiring with BJP govt at the Centre.

'Gross misuse of power': Supreme Court on SP government's land lease to Azam Khan's trust,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gross-misuse-of-power-supreme-court-on-sp-governments-land-lease-to-azam-khans-trust/articleshow/114227827.cms,"Azam Khan

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday upheld the UP BJP govt's decision in Feb 2023 to cancel the allocation of a prime land plot and a building in Rampur that had been leased at a nominal rent to the ' Maulana Mohd Ali Jauhar Trust ', run by the family of SP leader Azam Khan, while terming the 2012 allocation by the Akhilesh Yadav govt ""a gross misuse of power"".Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for the Trust, told a bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra that the Feb 2023 decision was a gross illegality as the Trust was not intimated about the alleged grounds of irregularities and no opportunity was accorded to it to respond to the allegations.""There was a complete breach of principles of natural justice by this unilateral and arbitrary decision of the state govt,"" he said.The CJI-led bench said Azam Khan, who is the founder trustee, was minister for urban development and minority affairs (in the Akhilesh Singh govt). ""He allotted the land and building to the family trust in which he is a member. How can land belonging to a govt body be transferred to a private body? This is a gross case of misuse of power by the minister,"" the bench said.Sibal said, ""I do not dispute the facts. If the allotment was mala fide, the cancellation of the lease too was mala fide and politically motivated. The trust was operating a school which provided education to poor students and charging an annual fee of Rs 20. It was not used for profiteering. There are 300 students in the school who have not been able to take admission in other schools.""Refuting the allegation that Khan had played a pivotal role in the allocation of land and building to his family trust, Sibal said, it was a cabinet note approved by the cabinet headed by the then CM (Akhilesh Yadav - March 15, 2012, to March 19, 2017).The bench dismissed the trust's appeal against an Allahabad HC order validating the cancellation of leasing out of govt land and building to the private trust but requested the education department of the state to examine the grievance of students not getting admitted to other schools and ensure that their rights under the RTE Act are not violated.HC had said, ""Khan himself approved the cabinet note and played an active role in getting it approved. Also, he himself determined and fixed the premium of Rs 10,007 for the valuable property, valued at Rs 20.44 crore, and a paltry sum of Rs 100 as annual lease. Being minister in the same department, he had full control over the file and its movement. He regretfully used his influence at every stage, camouflaging it behind public interest in a brazen misuse of power to perpetuate personal gains.""","The Supreme Court upheld the UP BJP govt's decision in Feb 2023 to cancel the allocation of a prime land plot and a building in Rampur.

Manippady, they said, also made an appeal to Muslims not to oppose the bill, which too was out of line.However, a senior BJP MP argued that the matter should be left to be decided by either the chairman, BJP’s Jagdambika Pal, or be allowed to be settled by vote, which was not accepted by the opposition and they boycotted the meeting. An opposition MP said allegations cannot be levelled against someone who is not there to defend himself.Pal overruled the objections and allowed Manippady to continue. A BJP member said the deposition was relevant as Manippady’s claims pertained to Waqf properties.Opposition MPs, including Congress’ Gaurav Gogoi and Imran Masood, A Raja of DMK, Arvind Sawant of Shiv Sena (UBT), AIMIM’s Asaduddin Owaisi, SP’s Mohibbullah & AAP’s Sanjay Singh, stormed out of the meet and expressed strong sentiments against its proceedings.The committee is not functioning in accordance with rules and regulations, Sawant told reporters.

The FIR stated that an amount of Rs 23 crore was credited from govt treasury to the bank account of Kumar, which he subsequently withdrew.JMM alleged the raids were part of “political vendetta” and that BJP had unleashed the central agency to target its opponents in view of upcoming elections. “We are going ahead with our people-centric work and they are doing their part of preparations,” CM Hemant Soren said without naming BJP.Thakur termed it a pressure tactics. “Since I refused to join BJP, the central agency has been pressed into action.

RAIPUR: The wife and 16-year-old daughter of a head constable in Chhattisgarh ’s Surajpur town were brutally murdered, allegedly by a history-sheeter who “hates police” so much that he had poured boiling oil on a patrol party a few hours before.The head constable was part of the team searching for the suspect, Kuldeep Sahu , after the oil attack. He returned home at 1am on Monday and walked into a scene of horror — blood splatters on the walls and ceilings and puddles on the floor.His wife and daughter were missing. The bodies were found 7km away in separate ditches, said Surajpur SP M R Ahire.Police fear the mother and daughter were raped because they were found nude. A mob torched Sahu’s house and gheraoed Kotwali PS.A police team saw him trying to speed away in a car and shot out its tyres, but he got into another vehicle and fled. SP Ahire said the first getaway vehicle had blood stains.On Monday, a mob of 500 gheraoed Kotwali police station in Surajpur, 350km from Raipur, demanding to know why Sahu hadn’t been arrested yet. They marched to his house, burned it down, and chased and thrashed an SDM when he tried to prevent the arson. The mob also set fire to a warehouse belonging to Sahu’s relative, triggering explosions as several LPG cylinders were stored there.Surajpur town was in shutdown mode all day. Sahu’s family was shifted to a safe place. Surguja range IG Ankit Garg is camping in town. It’s not clear if more than one person was involved in the double murder . Several police teams are out looking for Sahu. “He is a habitual and dangerous offender. Action had been taken against him in the past,” the IG said.Sahu is notorious for carrying grudges against police, which he acts out brazenly. He seemed to particularly target the head constable for reasons police are yet to understand. The latest round of attacks seem to have been triggered by arrest of his brother Sandeep, who allegedly threw a relative from the terrace of his house, say police. On Sunday evening, when a police team was patrolling the streets during a Durga puja procession, Sahu allegedly hurled a cauldron of boiling oil at them, which fell on a constable, severely burning him.Sahu escaped in the chaos and soon, police teams were all over town, looking for him. Sahu knew the head constable was among them and his wife and daughter would be alone at home, say police. The family lived on the first floor of a two-storey house, whose ground-floor occupants were on vacation. He managed to sneak into the house unchallenged and unleashed a horrific attack, say police.BJP alleged that Sahu was associated with Congress, which the opposition party has denied.

He claimed that under the influence of Sonia and Rahul Gandhi, Congress leaders are now engaged in what he called a ""bhu-hadap"" (land grabbing ) campaign.BJP national spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla also condemned the Kharge family’s actions, following reports that they had returned five acres of land allotted to them by the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board ( KIADB ) in Bengaluru's Aerospace Park, which was intended for Scheduled Caste entrepreneurs.

NEW DELHI: Encouraged by the decision of the family of Mallikarjun Kharge to return five acres of state-owned land in Bengaluru allotted to it, BJP on Monday went on the offensive against the Congress chief by demanding his resignation, while also alleging that the controversial deal is yet another confirmation of the obsession of politicians of the opposition party with land-grab .""From land donations that Gandhian leader Vinobha Bhave campaigned for to land grabbing... that has been Congress's trajectory,"" said BJP spokesperson Sudhansu Trivedi Monday while stressing that the decision of the Kharges was forced by a campaign launched by BJP which has filed a complaint with the Lokayukta .Talking to reporters here, Trivedi noted that the return of land by the Kharges follows a similar decision taken by Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah 's wife to return plots she had received from Mysuru Urban Development Authority. ""Congress's first family is involved in the National Herald scam which was essentially taking control of land and buildings allotted in different cities to the newspaper, the family's son-in-law is engaged in dubious land deals, and the party president and the CM and deputy CM (D K Shivakumar) grabbed state-owned lands,"" he said.Trivedi said that because of their own involvement in land scams, Congress leadership lacks the moral authority to take action against party netas who are encouraged by their example and are also grabbing public land. ""As a result, the opposition party has been reduced to a real estate firm, a group of property dealers,"" he added.",Mallikarjun Kharge's family to return five acres of state-owned land in Bengaluru.
