"In battle for Haryana's Ambala, BJP banks on pro-women schemes; Congress leans on its 'pillars of justice'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-battle-for-haryanas-ambala-bjp-banks-on-pro-women-schemes-cong-leans-on-its-pillars-of-justice/articleshow/110379386.cms,"AMBALA: The Ambala Lok Sabha constituency of Haryana, which goes to polls in the penultimate phase on May 25, is set to see a fierce bipolar contest between the ruling BJP and the Congress.The BJP's Banto Devi Kataria (59), the wife of late MP Rattan Lal Kataria who won the previous two elections in 2014 and 2019 by handsome margins, is seeking a fresh term in the Lower House this year. However, he faces a doughty rival in the form of sitting Congress MLA from Mullana (reserved) assembly and the son of veteran Congress leader Phool Chand Mullana, Varun Chaudhary (44).The reserved seat for Scheduled Caste candidates comprises the entire Ambala and Panchkula districts as well as part of Yamunanagar district.Nine assembly segments come within the ambit of the Ambala Lok Sabha seat. Of these, five--Panchkula, Ambala Cantt, Ambala City, Jagadhri and Yamunanagar--are currently with the BJP. The remaining four--Kalka, Naraingarh, Mulana-SC and Sadhaura-SC--are held by the Congress.The last two elections for the constituency saw Rattan Lal Kataria coast to victory by a big margin of votes. The Congress stood second in both these elections.In 2019, Kataria won Ambala by a margin of 3.42 lakh votes, trouncing the then-Haryana Pradesh Congress Committee president Kumari Selja. He secured 57 per cent of the votes polled.It is believed that the lingering effects of the farmers' protest of 2020 against the now-withdrawn farm laws by the Centre, which spilt over into the following year, and the more recent stir by the annadatas, demanding a law guaranteeing MSP (minimum support price), among a host of other demands, could hurt the prospects of the BJP candidate this year.However, the BJP is counting on the undiminished charisma, popular appeal and electoral goodwill of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to offset the lingering sentiment, if any, of the farmer protests. The flagship welfare schemes of the Centre, including those aimed at farmer welfare, also give the BJP hope of a hat-trick of wins in the constituency.Banto Kataria, who is contesting her maiden Lok Sabha elections , has also set her hopes of keeping the BJP flag flying in the constituency on the legacy of her husband and late former MP.Rattan Lal Kataria, her husband, was the BJP's Dalit face in Haryana who represented Ambala in the Lok Sabha thrice in an illustrious political career.On the campaign trail, she has also been highlighting the Centre's pro-women initiatives such as the passage of the Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam or women's quota Bill in Parliament, by virtue of which a third of seats in the Lower House and state legislative assemblies are to be reserved for women. She has also built her campaign pitch around the Centre's flagship Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana and the 'Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao' scheme.Just days before the election schedule was announced, the BJP changed its leadership in the state, replacing Manohar Lal Khattar with state unit president Nayab Singh Saini as the chief minister. The decision could help the party's chances of retaining the constituency, which is home to a sizeable population from the Saini caste.The BJP leadership also believes that having Saini, an OBC leader, as the chief minister will help in the consolidation of the non-Jat vote in the state in its favour.On the other hand, the Congress's Varun Chaudhary, in his campaign, has been going loud on his party's manifesto for the Lok Sabha polls, especially the part about the five 'pillars of justice' and the 25 guarantees each of them comprise. He has also been highlighting local issues such as the alleged drug menace and transportation woes in the constituency, accusing the BJP of failing to address these issues.There are a total of 14 candidates in the fray, including Jannayak Janta Party's Kiran Punia and Indian National Lok Dal's Gurpreet Singh. However, the BJP and the Congress are being seen as the main combatants in the battle for Ambala.","The Ambala Lok Sabha constituency of Haryana goes to polls in the penultimate phase on May 25.

Voters’ Profile



SP Banking On Verma’s Popularity



BJP Banks On Development



Issues That Matter



In Shahzadpur market of Akbarpur, the birthplace of Ram Manohar Lohia, stands a statue of the socialist ideologue, left unattended. It was two decades ago, in 2004, when the Samajwadi Party last won the Lok Sabha election from Ambedkarnagar .The constituency has been a BSP bastion since 1996, which the party president Mayawati represented thrice in 1998, 1999 and 2004. The BSP fort was breached only twice – by SP’s Shankhlal Majhi in 2004 by-elections and BJP’s Hari Om Pandey in 2014. In 2019, BSP’s Ritesh Pandey wrested the seat by securing over 52% votes, recording victory against BJP’s Mukut Bihari Verma by a margin of over 1 lakh votes.He is the son of veteran BSP leader Rakesh Pandey, now an SP MLA from Jalalpur. Rakesh had won the parliamentary seat on a BSP ticket in 2009.However, in March this year, Ritesh joined the saffron fold and is contesting the seat as a BJP candidate. He is facing another BSP turncoat, Lalji Verma , who had joined the ‘samajwadi’ camp in 2021 and was elected SP MLA from Katehari in the 2022 assembly polls. BSP has fielded Qamar Hayat Ansari.For Manoj Kumar Gaur, a sweet shop owner in Jalalpur area, Mayawati was the one who brought development to Ambedkarnagar.“Whatever you see here today is the result of the efforts of ‘Behenji’ (Mayawati). Any politician coming to seek votes here cannot give Jalalpur a miss. This is the road that takes you to Ambedkarnagar,” Gaur says. Another resident, Lal Bihari Yadav, says: “Only God knows who will win from here. I think it will be a close contest between Ritesh Pandey and Lalji Verma.” On BSP’s campaign, another resident observes, “Forget about someone campaigning for BSP, it is difficult to spot even party flags here.”Shankar Dayal Sharma, a voter from Akbarpur, says: “Mayawati made Ambedkarnagar a separate district in 1995. Mahamaya medical college, two engineering colleges, a diwani court, collectorate, agriculture research centre, three power plants, eight ITI colleges, Eklavya stadium, women’s degree college, Ambedkar villages, housing for poor under Kanshiram Awas Yojana, overbridge and roads are some of the major works done by BSP. She should have herself contested the election to ensure the party’s victory.” “The candidates that ‘Behenji’ fields in elections now have no recall value. The candidate that she has fielded in Ambedkarnagar is a local leader, who won local civic body’s chairman elections and is hardly known beyond Jalalpur,” he adds.BSP’s Qamar Hayat Ansari, has been the chairman of Jalalpur Nagar Palika thrice. The post has also been held twice each by his wife and father.Ambedkarnagar has around 18.7 lakh voters, of which SCs (Dalits) constitute over 26% (around 5 lakh), and Jatavs, BSP’s core voters, form the biggest chunk of around 3.8 lakh. There are around 5 lakh OBCs which include Nishads, Rajbhars, Kurmis, and Pals. Muslims constitute over 16% of voters, which is around 3.5 lakh.“In Muslim-dominated Tanda and Jalalpur, Rakesh Pandey has influence which may benefit his son Ritesh,” says Shivram Mishra, a local resident. Mohd Sultan Siddiqui from Tanda, which has over one lakh Muslim voters, says: “Muslims have no ‘rehnuma’ (leader). We will vote for the party that talks about our welfare.”The constituency also has over 1.7 lakh Kurmis who may support Lalji Verma. Ambedkarnagar has over 1.6 lakh Brahmins who traditionally vote for BJP. Yadavs, at around 1.3 lakh, and Thakurs at around 86,000, are also significant. “Rajputs could be among floating voters this time,” says Narendra Verma, an SP functionary.In the land of Lohia, Samajwadi Party is banking on the popularity of Lalji Verma, a prominent Kurmi leader, who has a long standing in politics. He has represented Tanda assembly constituency for four terms and Katehari twice.In 2007, when BSP formed a majority govt in UP, Verma was the state head of the party. He served as a cabinet minister in Mayawati govt in 2007 and held significant portfolios. In 2017, he was BSP’s legislature party leader in the UP assembly. His daughter, Chhaya Verma, was fielded by BSP in Jalalpur byelections in 2019, after the seat was vacated by BSP’s Ritesh Pandey, who won Ambedkarnagar Lok Sabha seat. However, she lost to Ritesh’s father, Rakesh Pandey, who contested as an SP candidate.SP had won Ambedkarnagar two decades ago, and since then, it has been making gains on BSP’s losses. Over a period, Lalji Verma, Ram Achal Rajbhar, Tribhuvan Dutt, Ram Murti Verma and Rakesh Pandey quit BSP to join SP. In the 2022 assembly elections, four out of five SP MLAs in Ambedkarnagar’s assembly segments were once with the BSP. However, what may give SP a tough time in 2024 is the fact that SBSP’s OP Rajbhar, Pallavi Patel of Apna Dal (K), Swami Prasad Maurya and Dara Singh Chauhan, who were with it in 2022, have moved on which could leave an impact on OBC and MBC votes.Beyond Ram temple and Modi magic, BJP is reaching out to voters with the projects that have been sanctioned in the district in the last 10 years. Land has been acquired for two industrial corridors in Katka, Jalalpur and Bivana. “Our welfare schemes have benefited everyone, irrespective of caste lines. Since there are a lot of farmers here, schemes catering to them have a huge impact,” says a BJP leader.Jobs, education and farmers’ uplift are the key areas which need the govt’s attention. “Ambedkarnagar has two cement plants and a unit of NTPC which generate jobs but the young population needs more job avenues,” says Rehan (20). “Quality of education in schools should also be improved,” adds his sister, Ruby, who aspires to be a doctor. Ambedkarnagar has a large rural population and has fertile land for agriculture. Cane growers abound in the region. “Many people are involved in the weaving industry which needs to be promoted,” says Shobhit Pal, who works in Urdu Bazaar locality.","The constituency has been a BSP bastion since 1996, which the party president Mayawati represented thrice in 1998, 1999 and 2004.

As compared to the 2019 and 2022 elections, what challenges are you facing in retaining this seat?

Based on poll equations, SP is confident of getting full support of Muslims after Shah Alam alias Guddu Jamali joined the party. How is BJP tackling the Guddu Jamali factor?

Muslim voters are dominant in Azamgarh. How will the BJP face this challenge?

SP is banking on caste equations. How do you see the prospects of the party?

Many people claim that they have not received the benefits of the development works claimed to be done by the BJP. Your take.

What do you have to offer to the people of Azamgarh?

With sour and sweet experiences of losing 2019 Lok Sabha against Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav and then wresting Azamgarh seat from SP by defeating Dharmendra Yadav in 2022 Lok Sabha by-poll, Bhojpuri actor-turned-politician and BJP MPis confident that he would retain the seat. In an interview with, he says people are extending unflinching support to BJP. Excerpts:There is no challenge from anyone because people have seen how we did not leave Azamgarh even after losing the 2019 Lok Sabha poll and intensified development works after winning the 2022 byelection. People have seen that they ensured SP’s victory, but they were nowhere to be seen in their celebrations or sorrow. I stood with the people of Azamgarh when they needed me the most. A large number of people, who supported SP with full dedication, are now with us for various reasons.Guddu Jamali had the support of Muslim voters and crossed the 2 lakh mark in last elections because he was a BSP candidate. Now, he has joined SP in his individual capacity and BSP is not in alliance with the SP. SBSP and Janwadi Party and many others, who stood with the SP in the 2022 assembly election, have now joined hands with us.Muslims have availed maximum benefits of the schemes launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. As they have witnessed the execution of all schemes and plans without any discrimination, a large number of Muslims will support us.SP might be contesting the election on caste and communal equations, but the majority of people are standing solidly behind us as they don’t need a ‘bhagoda neta’ (a deserter). They got nothing in return for their support to SP president Akhilesh Yadav and Dharmendra Yadav. They need an MP, who stays with them and ensures development.SP had gifted jail to Azamgarh. Our double-engine govt ensured the establishment of Maharaja Suheldev State University, a music institute in Hariharpur, an airport, and rail and road network. Development works being done by BJP are evident and being experienced by the people of Azamgarh.Proper planning is needed to develop Azamgarh on the lines of Varanasi and Gorakhpur. We have ensured the implementation of the master plan for the planned development of Azamgarh. The city will also get a ring road in the coming years.","Bhojpuri actor-turned-politician and BJP MP is confident that he would retain the seat.

'Can plant doubts in the mind of voters and political parties'

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: The Congress criticised the Election Commission (EC) on Thursday for withholding voter data from the public and accused the poll panel of failing to fulfill its constitutional obligations as well as exhibiting a biased inclination.Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi accused the EC of attempting to act as the ""election department"" of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) by not addressing complaints of model code violations by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah. Instead, the EC has been issuing generalized directions to political parties, which Singhvi referred to as ""false equivalences.""Singhvi's remarks followed the poll panel's submission of an affidavit to the Supreme Court , in which the commission stated that the ""indiscriminate disclosure"" of polling station-wise voter-turnout data and its publication on the EC website would lead to chaos in the ongoing Lok Sabha election machinery. Singhvi argued that the EC's actions regarding complaints against top BJP leaders and its refusal to disclose voter data are not befitting of a high-level constitutional institution.""This is against the constitutional responsibilities of the institution. This is the Election Commission, not the election agent of any party. When a constitutional institution does not follow the Constitution and shows inclination towards power, then it should be understood that this is the end of democracy,"" Singhvi said.""We are not asking the EC about EVMs (electronic voting machines) but about disclosure of data. Through this stand in its ridiculous affidavit, the EC is falling into the BJP's trap to orchestrate decimation and destruction of electoral democracy,"" he added.Singhvi alleged that the reply filed by the EC in the apex court is just an 'escape mechanism'""This reply of the Election Commission is just an escape mechanism. Whereas anyone can get this data by paying money to the Election Commission,"" Singhvi alleged.Earlier, EC had filed a counter affidavit in the Supreme Court, opposing the demand made by an NGO to upload polling station-wise voter turnout data on its website within 48 hours of the conclusion of polling for each phase of the Lok Sabha elections. The NGO, 'Association for Democratic Reforms', has also sought a direction to the poll panel to upload scanned legible copies of Form 17C Part-I (Account of Votes Recorded) of all polling stations immediately after the polls. The matter is scheduled to be heard by a vacation bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and Satish Chandra Sharma.The Election Commission's 225-page affidavit said, ""It is submitted that if the reliefs sought by the petitioner is allowed, it will not only be in teeth of the aforesaid legal position but will also cause chaos in the election machinery which is already in motion for the ongoing General Elections to the Lok Sabha, 2024.""""This indicates that the allegation of discrepancies in voter turnout data made by the petitioner in the main petition as well as the present application is misleading, false and based on mere suspicion,"" it added.The poll panel had earlier also refuted the grand old party's claims of delaying in the release of the final voting percentages for the initial phases of the Lok Sabha elections, suggesting that such delays cast doubts on the credibility of the data provided by the poll panel.“Through innuendos and insinuations, the contents of the post tend to create disharmony in respect of the delicate space of election management, can plant doubts in the mind of voters and political parties…” EC said in response to a letter written by Congress president Kharge questioning the rationale behind EC's delay in releasing the voter turnout data for the first two phases of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.","Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi accused the EC of attempting to act as the ""election department"" of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Singhvi's remarks followed the poll panel's submission of an affidavit to the Supreme Court in which it stated that the ""indiscriminate disclosure"" of polling station-wise voter-turnout data would lead to chaos.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110372004,imgsize-1607936,width-400,resizemode-4/110372004.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The campaigning for the sixth phase of the Lok Sabha elections ended on Thursday amid the sweltering heat and high-pitch political rhetorics and promises by contestants in fray. Elections in this phase is set to take place on May 25 Saturday, with the voting scheduled in 58 constituencies across six states and two Union territories.In the sixth phase polling will be held in all seven seats in Delhi, 14 seats in Uttar Pradesh , all 10 seats of Haryana , 8 seats each in Bihar and West Bengal , six seats in Odisha, four seats in Jharkhand and one seat in Jammu and Kashmir.The prominent candidates in the sixth phase of Lok Sabha polls are Dharmendra Pradhan (BJP) from Sambalpur (Odisha), Manoj Tiwari (BJP) and Kanhaiya Kumar ( Congress ) from North East Delhi, Maneka Gandhi (BJP) from Sultanpur (Uttar Pradesh), Mehbooba Mufti (PDP) from Anantnag-Rajouri (Jammu & Kashmir), Abhijit Gangopadhyay (BJP) from Tamluk (West Bengal), and BJP 's Manohar Lal Khattar (Karnal, Haryana), Naveen Jindal (Kurukshetra) and Rao Inderjit Singh (Gurgaon).Prime Minister Narendra Modi held rallies in Punjab and Haryana on the last day of campaigning, taking a swipe at the INDIA bloc saying the ""cow hasn't given milk but the fight over ghee has started"" as the alliance is ""talking about having five PMs in five years"".PM Modi also argued that the Indian public in this election are not only electing a Prime Minister but also are deciding upon the ""country's future.""""Till Modi is alive, no one can snatch the reservation for Dalits and tribals,"" he added.The day before, addressing an election meeting here PM Modi said, ""Just today, the Calcutta High Court has given a big slap to this INDI alliance. The court has cancelled all OBC certificates issued since 2010. Why? Because the West Bengal government issued unwarranted OBC certificates to Muslims just because of the vote bank.""In Delhi, the BJP's poll campaign featured rallies by PM Modi and canvassing by union ministers Amit Shah, defense minister Rajnath Singh, Nitin Gadkari, Smriti Irani and Piyush Goyal and chief ministers of BJP-ruled states, including Yogi Adityanath (Uttar Pradesh), Pushkar Singh Dhami (Uttarakhand) and Pramod Sawant (Goa).The Congress's campaign was spearheaded by its chief Mallikarjun Kharge, senior leader Rahul Gandhi , and Sachin Pilot, among others. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, released on interim bail till June 1, held roadshows in support of Congress candidates, while Pilot campaigned for AAP 's South Delhi candidate Sahi Ram Pahalwan.AAP's campaign received a boost with Kejriwal's release from Tihar. When he was in jail, his wife Sunita Kejriwal held roadshows for party candidates, and senior party leaders conducted various outreach activities under the party's 'Jail Ka Jawab Vote Se' campaign. Following his release the AAP supremo and Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann led roadshows in some constituencies, with Sunita also joining her husband for poll meetings.During the campaigning in Odisha, BJP's Puri candidate Sambit Patra sparked controversy by saying that ""Lord Jagannath is a devotee of Modi,"" later expressing regret for his remark. The ruling Biju Janata Dal (BJD) reacted strongly, saying Patra's ""offensive"" comment deeply hurt the sentiments of Odias worldwide. The party also filed a complaint with the EC against Patra for using an image of Jagannath temple in a local media advertisement issued by him.While campaigning in Uttar Pradesh, PM Modi accused the Congress and the Samajwadi Party of prioritising their vote bank over the Kumbh mela. BSP chief Mayawati labeled both the Congress and the BJP as anti-Dalit and anti-backward, claiming their intentions and thoughts oppose reservationUnion home minister Amit Shah in his rallies said that in the five rounds of polling till now, BJP has ""crossed 310"" and the Congress is ""not even getting 40 seats"".Addressing a rally in Sant Kabir Nagar in Uttar Pradesh, Amit Shah accused several opposition party leaders of nepotism saying , ""Lalu Prasad Yadav wants to make his son the chief minister, Uddhav Thackeray wants to make his son the chief minister, Sharad Pawar wants to make his daughter the chief minister, Stalin wants to make his son the chief minister, Mamata Banerjee wants to make her nephew the chief minister and Sonia Gandhi wants to make her son Rahul Gandhi the prime minister.""As the campaigning reached fever pitch, the Election Commission intervened star campaigners on Wednesday directing BJP leaders to refrain from making speeches on religious and communal lines and cautioning the Congress against potentially divisive statements regarding the socioeconomic composition of the armed forces.With the conclusion of Phase 5, polling for general elections had crossed the halfway mark as it was completed in 25 states and Union territories and 428 constituencies out of 543. The last phase of polling is scheduled on June 1 and counting of votes will be taken up on June 4.","The campaigning for the sixth phase of the Lok Sabha elections ended on Thursday.

Kejriwal voiced his concerns during a press briefing in the capital and claimed that his old and ailing parents were being targeted to ""break"" him. He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi by doing this has ""crossed all limits"".Expressing deep anguish, Kejriwal said that his mother is battling multiple ailments, while his father is grappling with hearing issues. ""I have a message and appeal for PM Modi. You arrested my MLAs but I did not break. You arrested my minister but you could not make me bow. You arrested me and I was harassed in jail,"" he said.""But today you crossed all limits. To break me you targeted my old and ailing parents. My mother is suffering from multiple ailments. The day I was arrested (March 21), she had returned from hospital. My father is 85 years old and has hearing issues. Do you think my parents are guilty? Why are my parents being harassed? God will not forgive you,"" Kejriwal, who was arrested in the Delhi excise policy-linked money laundering case, said.This comes after the Delhi Police announced that it will not record the statement of the chief minister's parents today in connection with the assault case involving Swati Maliwal, a Rajya Sabha MP from the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). Sources within the Delhi Police cited the need for further time to gather statements, highlighting the circumstances leading up to the incident.Kejriwal, earlier in response, conveyed his readiness to cooperate with the authorities, expressing his uncertainty regarding the police's forthcoming actions.""I am waiting for the police with my parents and wife. Yesterday the police called my parents and asked for time for interrogation. But they have not given any information yet whether they will come or not,"" the Delhi CM stated.The AAP, in a show of solidarity with Kejriwal, has vehemently criticized the perceived targeting of his parents by the Delhi Police. Atishi, a prominent AAP leader and Delhi minister, condemned the actions as politically motivated and called upon the people of Delhi to respond through their votes.""Has our PM stooped so low as to persecute elderly and ill parents? I don't think politics in the country has ever sunk this low,"" Atishi said.Highlighting the frail health condition of Kejriwal's parents, Atishi emphasized the gravity of the situation and appealed for public support.The AAP leader further accused the Delhi Police of being aligned with the BJP's political agenda, alleging a conspiracy orchestrated by the ruling party.""The whole incident is a BJP conspiracy, and BJP should also be asked now because deals have been made with Swati Maliwal under which a whole conspiracy has been hatched,"" Atishi said.The case involving Swati Maliwal and Bibhav Kumar has garnered significant attention, with a Special Investigation Team (SIT) formed to probe the matter. Bibhav Kumar, who was arrested by the Delhi Police, has lodged a counter-complaint against Maliwal.As the situation unfolds, the political landscape in Delhi remains charged, with ramifications likely to extend beyond the immediate context of the assault case.(With inputs from agencies)",Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal questions the rationale behind what he perceives as targeting his elderly and ailing parents.

How confident are you of your victory in Azamgarh. Are caste equations working in your favour?

How will you stop the division of OBC who traditionally support

SP

in Azamgarh?

Your rival parties are questioning why SP prefers Yadav candidates only from Saifai family. Your take.

BJP is claiming that it will defeat SP in Azamgarh based on development works done by it?

What is SP doing to stop BJP from repeating a performance like that in 2019 general elections?

Samajwadi Party candidate from Azamgarh,, says that those trying to become well-wishers of the Yadav community should first ensure the release of innocent youths languishing in jails and stop “fake encounters”. In an interview with, Yadav says that he is confident of his victory as people are looking at INDIA bloc with great expectations. Excerpts:This election is no longer about caste and communal equations. People from all sections of the society, including OBC, Dalits and minorities, who have faith in democracy, Constitution , and development, are now united. The young generation is upset over paper leaks, unemployment and Agniveer scheme, and has high expectations from the INDIA bloc.There is no division of traditional votes. More than 90% of the people from all sections of the society are extending support to INDIA bloc. People do not want scrapping of the Constitution, reservation, and democracy.If they are trying to prove that they are well-wishers of Yadavs, they should stop fake encountersof Yadavs, and release those who are in jail on fake charges. In fact, they are upset with SP’s PDA formula given by party chief Akhilesh Yadav. They are making an issue out of five tickets to a family. We fought elections in these constituencies in 2014 and 2019, and we will continue to do so in future.BJP has given nothing for Azamgarh. Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited recently and opened a room in the name of the airport, which had already been developed by ‘netaji’ (SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav) before 2007. And, 33 days after its opening by PM, the same room caught fire. They are trying to take credit for the works already done by SP.Today, BJP has nothing to offer to the people. They are claiming that they will win over 400 seats. But as the election is progressing, it is becoming clear that they will stay below 200 seats.","Samajwadi Party candidate from Azamgarh says those trying to become well-wishers of the Yadav community should first ensure the release of innocent youths languishing in jails.

Why Naveen factor is Pradhan concern in west Odisha fight,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-naveen-factor-is-pradhan-concern-in-west-odisha-fight/articleshow/110378392.cms,"SAMBALUPUR: Sambalpur , the gateway to western Odisha , is witnessing a high-profile battle with BJD expecting a favourable mandate for a “job well done” in the state and BJP counting on anti-incumbency .Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan , 54, is back for a Lok Sabha contest after 20 years while BJD has deployed its No.2, Pranab Prakash Das, tagged publicly as the regional party’s senapati (commander), to challenge him.Sambalpur constituency spans three districts: Deogarh, Sambalpur, and parts of Angul. BJP’s Nitesh Ganga Deb emerged victorious in 2019. BJP had won all five Lok Sabha seats in western Odisha back then but could manage only eight of the 35 assembly segments. BJP expects Sambalpur to set a pan-Odisha momentum even in Vidhan Sabha contests. The saffron party is also banking on PM Narendra Modi’s popularity. “The trust in the PM is very high in Odisha. Moreover, people are angry with BJD and there is strong anti-incumbency. We are not only winning big in Lok Sabha but going to form a govt in Vidhan Sabha,” said Pradhan.BJP did better in western Odisha than in the state’s coastal areas last time. And the party is drawing strength from the region’s proximity to Chhattisgarh, which has a BJP govt. More than 100 BJP functionaries from Chhattisgarh, including the entire Cabinet led by its CM Vishnu Deo Sai, have been campaigning in western Odisha.BJP’s manifesto includes several key promises aimed at attracting voters in western Odisha. One of the most significant among them is the establishment of a second AllIndia Institute of Medical Sciences in Sambalpur. Furthermore, the party has announced its intention to initiate a proposal to grant central university status to Sambalpur University. The party’s commitment to buying paddy at Rs 3,100 per quintal, up from the current minimum support price of Rs 2,183, is also expected to resonate with the farmers in Hirakud command area.As chief minister Naveen Patnaik seeks a sixth straight term, anti-incumbency may be a threat for BJD in western Odisha. Union home minister Amit Shah in his rally in Sunda rgarh last week complained of the state govt’s step-motherly treatment of western Odisha.Claiming that the BJD govt had failed to bring development to the state in its 25 years in office, pushing it back by 50 years, Shah said, “Step-motherly treatment has been meted out by this (BJD) govt, particularly to the western region.”BJD candidate Das begged to differ, saying there is a strong sentiment in favour of Patnaik across the state. “People have decided to bring Naveen Patnaik back as they want him to continue the good work he’s been doing. Under Naveen babu’s leadership, BJD results get better in poll after poll,” he said.But what does the common man think? Near the 160-year-old sarsatia shop in Budhima Gali in Kunjelpada, owner Rinku dada claims Patnaik gets the Sambalpur delicacy from his establishment given that not many places have continued the art of making this sweet. A picture of Pradhan having sarsatia is seen at the shop. A local, who did not want to be named, said, “Naveen is still popular in the assembly, but there is now a real fear that he will hand over the CM post to some nonOdia.” Her reference could be to BJD strategist VK Pandian.Tinku Nayak, a cab driver from Bolangir, said: “BJD is not going to have it easy, if at all it wins. In Lok Sabha, BJP will get most seats. Naveen babu didn’t do anything for us (drivers). The govt hospitals in Sambalpur don’t even have doctors.”Sambalpur has been the focal point of a long-standing demand for a separate bench of the Orissa High Court in the region. The lawyers’ agitation, which had been going on for decades, came to a sudden halt in 2022 following a violent turn of events and strong objections from Supreme Court.Pradhan, a prominent OBC leader belonging to the Chasa caste, has consolidated support within the community, which has a significant presence in Sambalpur. In the previous election, Odisha witnessed a split voting pattern. For instance, in Bargarh, BJP failed to secure any of the seven assembly seats but managed to win the Lok Sabha seat. This time, BJP’s campaign strategy focuses on prioritising assembly seats and then targeting the Lok Sabha with the goal of achieving a “double engine” govt.","Sambalpur constituency spans three districts: Deogarh, Sambalpur, and parts of Angul.

Lok Sabha elections: Absolute no. of votes down in 88 seats from 5 years ago,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/absolute-no-of-votes-down-in-88-seats-from-5-yrs-ago/articleshow/110375046.cms,"In

, 25% of seats saw fewer votes cast than in '19

After five rounds of polling, an analysis of turnout shows that of the 409 seats where data can be compared with 2019, nearly two-thirds, or 258, have witnessed a lower percentage turnout this year and 88 (more than one in five) have seen even the absolute number of votes drop from five years ago.Seats with lower turnout or lower absolute vote numbers are not evenly spread but bunched in some states. For instance, all 20 of Kerala's seats saw the turnout drop and 12 of them recorded fewer votes in EVMs than in 2019. In Uttarakhand, too, all five seats saw lower turnout and three of the six had fewer people voting this time.In Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu, nearly half the seats saw the absolute number of voters declining and almost 90% of the seats in these states recorded lower turnout. Three-quarters of seats in UP and Madhya Pradesh also saw lower turnouts, but only about a third of the seats in these Hindi heartland states recorded fewer votes than in 2019.In Gujarat and West Bengal, turnouts were lower than in 2019 in all but one seat in each case, but not a single Bengal seat had fewer voters with the increase in the electorate more than offsetting the drop in turnout. In Gujarat, about a quarter of the seats saw fewer votes cast. Similarly, in Bihar, 21 of the 24 seats recorded lower turnouts than 2019, but only one saw the absolute number of votes go down.In Maharashtra, 20 of the 48 seats had lower turnouts but only six had fewer people turning up to vote on polling day. Interestingly, of the six seats across the country that had a lower electorate than in 2019 among the 409 being analysed here, five were in Maharashtra and included Pune and Mumbai South. However, only three of the five had fewer votes being cast this time.Andhra Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Odisha, Telangana and West Bengal had no seats with fewer votes this time than in 2019, though all of them had some that recorded lower turnouts. Chhattisgarh was the only major state in which both turnout and absolute vote counts were higher in every seat.While EC has not put out data on the absolute number of votes cast in each seat, the fact that the electorate is known and the turnout percentage is also known to two decimal places means it is possible to work out an approximate value for votes polled. This analysis is based on that approximation. Of the 428 seats that have polled, only 409 are comparable with 2019 since the 14 seats in Assam and five seats in Jammu & Kashmir have been redrawn since then.","Of the 409 seats where data can be compared with 2019, nearly two-thirds, or 258, have witnessed a lower percentage turnout. 88 (more than one in five) have seen even the absolute number of votes drop from five years ago.

In the first phase, only Jamui saw higher percentage of women electors casting their votes.In Jharkhand too, where polling has been completed for eight seats in the fourth and fifth phases, a higher percentage of females turned up at polling stations across all constituencies. In the case of Odisha, five out of the nine constituencies where polling has been completed saw a similar trend. In West Bengal, 18 out of the 25 constituencies that have gone to polls have also reported higher percentage of registered women electors casting their votes.The trend was no different in nearly half of all the seats in Kerala and Tamil Nadu, while all the LS constituencies in Gujarat and Maharashtra saw higher percentage of male voters exercising their franchise than women.Ranjana Kumari, director of Centre for Social Research, said, ""We are observing a similar pattern where women are voting more in numbers in many constituencies in this election. Women have largely been the beneficiaries (lavarthis) of welfare programmes. The political aspiration among local women has also increased since 1993 when Panchayati Raj Act was passed and women became elected representatives. That's also helping women make their own decisions and there is more political consciousness.""Prasanna Mishra, a Bhubaneswar-based former bureaucrat and public policy analyst, said more women voting indicates better social mobility. ""There is a spontaneous desire of women folk to express their entitlement. But it may not be necessary that they are supporting the incumbent govt for creating a large number of women self help groups,"" he added.","In nearly 32% of Lok Sabha constituencies - 137 out of the 427 seats for which voter turnout data has been released - females have accounted for higher percentage of votes cast in the first five phases of elections.

The builder faces charges for allowing his underage son, who lacks a valid driving licence and proper training and consumed alcohol, to drive the car.Police also arrested Naman Bhutada and Sachin Kaatkar, owner and staffer of a Pune pub, and Sandip Sangle, an assistant manager at another pub.They were charged with serving liquor to minors without verifying their age.

Where is Prajwal?

NEW DELHI: HD Kumaraswamy, JD(S) Karnataka president, has once again urged his nephew and Hassan MP Prajwal Revanna to return from overseas and cooperate with the investigation into the sexual abuse allegations against him.Kumaraswamy acknowledged that Prajwal's delayed return has tarnished the image of both the party and the HD Deve Gowda family .""I openly appealed to him that if he has any respect for the party, its karyakartas, and Deve Gowda, he should come back from wherever he is.If he has not done anything wrong, he can prove it; if he has done wrong, then he must face the punishment.""The JD(S) leader implored the MP not to ""take advice from advocates on the matter"". ""To save his morality, he must come back from wherever he is. This is my demand,"" Kumaraswamy stated, expressing hope that Prajwal will pay heed to his appeal.The primary issue is that Revanna's whereabouts are currently unknown.Revanna, the grandson of former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda, is the central figure in a sexual abuse case . He departed from India on a diplomatic passport, reportedly to Germany, just one day after the Lok Sabha elections took place in his constituency.Numerous women have accused the MP of violating their modesty and recording the acts on camera.On April 27, at the request of the State Commission for Women, the Karnataka government formed a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to investigate the alleged video clips of sexual abuse and exploitation involving the Hassan MP.Although the probe was ordered a day after the second phase of polling in the state, pen drives containing thousands of explicit video clips featuring multiple women had been circulating in Hassan and nearby areas well before the election.The case has become a political flashpoint during the ongoing Lok Sabha elections, with the Congress criticising the BJP for aligning with a ""tainted"" MP and his party. The opposition parties have also targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi for campaigning for him.The BJP, on the other hand, has accused the Congress of allowing the accused to escape from the state.Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah has once again written to PM Modi, requesting the cancellation of the MP's diplomatic passport.The Interpol has already issued a 'Blue Corner Notice' to gather information on Prajwal Revanna's whereabouts, following a request from the SIT through the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).A Special Court for Elected Representatives has also issued an arrest warrant against Prajwal Revanna, based on an application filed by the SIT.Kumaraswamy, while addressing media persons on Wednesday, stated that Prajwal was not in contact with his father and MLA H D Revanna or anyone else.""Where will I go search for him? If I go abroad, they will say I have gone to save Prajwal... he is not in contact with anyone... with the advice of some advocates, all these things have happened. In case, I had come to know about him leaving for abroad on April 27, I would have stopped him,"" he said.""Prajwal had sought a week to appear before SIT, but it was denied and another rape case was filed against him. With all this he might be afraid (to come back),"" he added.Earlier this month, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal confirmed that Revanna traveled to Germany on a diplomatic passport without seeking political clearance for the trip.""No political clearance was either sought from or issued by MEA in respect of the travel of the said MP to Germany,"" Jaiswal had stated.","HD Kumaraswamy, JD(S) Karnataka president, has urged his nephew and Hassan MP Prajwal Revanna to return from overseas.

During the reception, he had Ghoomar dancers perform, a traditional Rajasthani dance.



Some members of the Samaj objected to this performance.



On February 20th, the Samaj, led by Sadar Shahabuddin, expelled Rashid Khan and his family from the organization.



Rashid Khan filed an FIR against Sadar Shahabuddin under sections 135 A and 135B, which deal with promoting enmity between different groups and interfering with religious practices.

BHOPAL: A case has been registered against key members of the Muslim Marwari Lohar Samaj in Harda, Madhya Pradesh , for allegedly ostracizing a family over a ‘ Ghoomar dance ’ performance at a wedding reception .Rashid Khan , a member of the Muslim Marwari Lohar Vikas Committee, reportedly organized a reception for his son and included a performance by Ghoomar dancers, a traditional Rajasthani art form.However, some members of the Samaj objected to the performance, leading to a meeting on February 20th where Khan and his family were expelled from the organization.Khan, considering this expulsion a form of ostracization and interference with his religious practices, filed a complaint against Sadar Shahabuddin , leader of the Samaj, under sections 135A and 135B of the Indian Penal Code. These sections deal with promoting enmity between different groups and interfering with religious practices of any community.Only after intervention by Chief Minister Dr Mohan Yadav, did the police register a case against Sadar Shahabuddin and others involved in the decision to expel Khan's family. He has expressed his gratitude to the Chief Minister for his intervention in the matter.Police said Rashid Khan had organized a wedding reception for his son. The celebration included a DJ procession, a Ghoomar dance performance by a troupe from Rajasthan, and a feast for over 3500 guests.The Samaj committee subsequently called a meeting and, without prior notice to the [Khan family], imposed sanctions which included eviction from the society and barring them from attending social gatherings for the next 11 months. The family was also reportedly fined Rs 1 lakh.Khan contested the society's actions, arguing that the celebration was organized within their means and did not violate any previously communicated rules.Before filing a police complaint, Khan had appealed to the society committee to reconsider the sanctions. Khan's family believe they are being targeted due to jealousy and social hierarchy within the society. They point out their past contributions to society events, including a Rs 3 lakh donation for a mass conference in 2021.However, the office bearers of the Muslim Marwari Lohar Samaj society president, while talking to a section of local media, maintained that the Khan family was not evicted but rather banned from attending society-organized meals. He justifies this action by citing a pre-existing rule against DJs and dance performances at weddings. The Khan family has filed a complaint with the police.","Rashid Khan, a member of the Muslim Marwari Lohar Vikas Committee, organized a wedding reception for his son Moin.
