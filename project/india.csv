PATNA: Nitish Kumar is the leader and CM of NDA govt in Bihar and people trust him and PM Narendra Modi to deliver on their promises in the state, BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad said Thursday while NDA tore into INDIA bloc after the opposition named RJD ’s Tejashwi Prasad as its chief ministerial face before elections in Nov. NDA called the bloc’s move a “shameful alliance of corruption and opportunism”.“Charges have already been framed against Tejashwi in the IRCTC case. The court has stated that this is a very serious case of corruption. Tejashwi is an accused in this case under Section 420 of the IPC,” Prasad said. When reporters asked him who will be the NDA’s CM face, Prasad said: “Where is a vacancy?”BJP, JDU, and LJP (Ram Vilas) functionaries — joined by political strategist-turned-activist Prashant Kishor — accused the opposition bloc of pushing Bihar toward a “return of jungle raj” under the shadow of the alleged scam. Bihar deputy CM Samrat Choudhary of BJP said RJD was “torturing even its allies”. “This is a day of shame for Bihar that Grand Alliance promised to make the son of a thief the CM for sake of power. Everyone knows when Lalu was in office, criminals were encouraged. They want to bring back the same govt, and Congress is encouraging this.”The IRCTC land-for-jobs scam dates back to the period when RJD chief Lalu Prasad, as railway minister during first UPA govt of 2004-2009, allegedly awarded contracts for two railway hotels in exchange for land plots transferred to a firm linked to his family.Both Lalu and Tejashwi have denied wrongdoing, calling the case politically motivated.UP deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya said RJD-Congress tie-up was “a mismatched game”, recalling that Lalu was jailed during Congress’s tenure. “Now he is aligned with the same Congress. This alliance will not work in Bihar,” Maurya said.Union minister and LJP (RV) chief Chirag Paswan mocked the alliance for sidelining Congress. “After so many controversies, what would they do if they accepted your face? Congress was insulted as the face of just one man was visible in the entire press conference,” he said.JDU targeted both Tejashwi and INDIA bloc’s social arithmetic, taking a swipe at reports VIP chief Mukesh Sahani was promised the deputy CM post. “Laddoos for 2.60% of the Mallahs, pumpkins for 18% of the Muslims. Are Muslims there only to scare them to vote?” JDU wrote on X.Jan Suraaj founder Prashant Kishor ridiculed Tejashwi’s promise to provide govt jobs to one member of every family. “The one who promises three crore jobs isn’t saying what he did when his parents were in power. Now all that’s left to hear is that Tejashwi will make Bihar a golden Lanka in a few days,” he said.BJP national spokesperson Ajay Alok said Congress had “sold its self-respect” by agreeing to Tejashwi’s projection. “Sitting on a stage where Rahul Gandhi’s photo was not even on the poster, Ashok Gehlot exposed his party’s helplessness by declaring Tejashwi as CM face.... Let Nov 14 come, they will be seen fighting each other,” he said, referring to the date of poll results.","BJP, JDU, and LJP functionaries accuse the opposition bloc of pushing Bihar toward a “return of jungle raj” under the shadow of the alleged scam.

""Congress Only Party To Respect Him..."" Pappu Yadav Alleges BJP Sidelining Nitish Kumar in NDA

Poll Do you believe Nitish Kumar's return to NDA is a positive move for Bihar? Yes, it's a great decision No, it's not beneficial

NEW DELHI: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday reflected on his past alliances with the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), saying he had joined the party “because of circumstances.” Reaffirming his commitment to the NDA , he said he is “back in NDA for good.” He also criticised the RJD’s rule before his 20-year tenure as chief minister, saying, “pehle bahut bura haal tha,” and highlighted the shortcomings of the Lalu-Rabri governments, taking aim at their administration.Addressing his first election rally in Minapur, Muzaffarpur, Kumar took a dig at his rival Lalu Prasad and said, “Because of circumstances, I had to tie up with those people, but it did not take me long to realise that they were good for nothing. Now I am back (in NDA) for good.”Kumar recalled that his earlier alliances with the RJD in 2015 and 2022 both lasted less than two years. On both occasions, Lalu’s son Tejashwi Yadav, now leader of the opposition in Vidhan Sabha, served as his deputy chief minister.He highlighted his government’s focus on improving infrastructure, education, and healthcare in Bihar, and praised the Narendra Modi government at the Centre for its support.Talking about law and order, Kumar said, “An atmosphere of terror had prevailed in Bihar because of poor law and order and alleged patronage to criminals by the powers that be, until I took over. But now, it is for all to see how much things have changed.”He added that communal harmony has also improved. “Even disputes between Hindus and Muslims have come down because we were sensitive to needs like fencing of religious places of both faiths,” he said.Taking a swipe at Lalu Prasad, Kumar accused him of ignoring women’s welfare during his tenure. “Did the ones in power do anything for women? They could not have cared less. Only when, after seven years of chief ministership, a situation came where stepping down could not have been avoided, the wife was installed,” he said, referring to Rabri Devi’s appointment as chief minister in 1997.Kumar contrasted this with his own government’s focus on women’s empowerment, citing the success of self-help groups and the Mukhyamantri Mahila Rojgar Yojana, under which Rs 10,000 each has been transferred to over one crore women beneficiaries.Seeking a record fifth consecutive term, Nitish Kumar said he was disillusioned with the RJD after two short-lived alliances and has now decided to stay with the NDA for good.","Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar reflected on his past alliances with the Rashtriya Janata Dal.

Deletions took place using VoIP between Dec 2022 & Feb 2023





BENGALURU: Karnataka police’s special investigation team probing the alleged voter deletion scam in Aland constituency during the 2023 assembly polls has reportedly uncovered evidence of attempts to remove names from the electoral rolls, and identified six suspects.Sleuths said deletions were carried out at a cyber centre in Aland, where operators were allegedly paid Rs 80 per application. SIT sources said they suspect accused paid Rs 4.8 lakh to those who facilitated the deletions. Officials are probing how the centre gained access to EC’s portal to file fake voter deletion requests. The probe was carried out by CID cyber crime unit before SIT took over. “At least 6,000 votes have been allegedly deleted,” a CID official said.According to CID sources, preliminary findings show that the deletions took place between Dec 2022 and Feb 2023 using voice over internet protocol (VoIP). “There were requests to delete 6,994 votes. While a few were genuine, most were bogus. The applications allegedly targeted Dalit and minority voters. The deletions were halted after the Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) ordered a status quo,” CID officials said.The irregularities have been traced to local resident Mohammed Ashfaq, who was questioned in Feb 2023 and let off. He is currently in Dubai and a blue corner notice is being processed to locate him.Aland, part of Kalaburagi district, is represented by Congress MLA B R Patil. He along with Kalaburagi district minister Priyank Kharge were the first to flag the irregularities to the CEO.

Opposition gathbandhan an unruly alliance of netas out on bail: PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/opposition-gathbandhan-an-unruly-alliance-of-netas-out-on-bail-pm-modi/articleshow/124771949.cms,"PATNA/NEW DELHI: Hours after the Mahagathbandhan named Tejashwi Yadav as its CM face, PM Modi on Thursday raised the pitch of ‘jungle raj’, saying people will not forget the 15-year RJD govt for 100 years and never allow its return, however hard the opposition alliance may try.‘Jungle raj’ was the constant theme in his interaction with five youths associated with BJP as he slammed the opposition’s gathbandhan as “lathbandhan” (unruly alliance), in what was seen as allusion to the lawlessness that characterised RJD’s 15 years in office under Tejashwi’s parents, Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi, and the aggression that many associate with RJD. Its one specialty is that its netas, whether from Patna or Delhi — a reference to the RJD and Congress brass — are on out bail in corruption cases, he further said, in what was a dig at the legal troubles of both Tejashwi and Rahul Gandhi. The virtual interaction, Modi’s second, conducted as part of BJP’s “Mera Booth Sabse Mazboot” programme, was scheduled the morning ahead of the joint press conference of opposition politicians, amid indications they may name former deputy CM Tejashwi as their choice for CM.Modi will kick off his Bihar campaign on Friday with a visit to the late Karpoori Thakur’s village in Samastipur district. Thakur, a socialist neta, was a messiah of EBCs, and the NDA govt had conferred on him the Bharat Ratna last year.Lauding CM Nitish Kumar-headed NDA govt for bringing the state out of the darkness of RJD’s alleged ‘jungle raj’ and ushering in the light of development, he said the assembly polls will write a new chapter of state’s prosperity. “Now jan vishwas (people’s trust) and not ‘jungle raj reigns in the state.”A thief finds it difficult to steal in light, so he sneaks in with a lantern, Modi said, in reference to RJD’s poll symbol and the power shortages the state used to suffer under its govt. “People are not going to forget jungle raj for the next 100 years,” he said, asking BJP’s young members to invite older voters, who lived under RJD govt during 1990-2005, to share their experiences with others. Future of young generations was destroyed in that period, Modi said. “Bihar is waiting with renewed expectation for NDA govt to return to office with a bigger majority.” The state’s young population is saying that “raftaar pakar chuka Bihar, phir se NDA sarkar”.Reaching out to women, Modi said they were confined to their homes during the RJD’s long stint in office. But under the present govt’s self-employment scheme, Rs 10,000 each had been given to over 1.21 crore women and those left out will be included after Nov 14, the day of poll result, when a new era of women empowerment will begin, he added.The PM said stable govts in Bihar and the Centre have ensured implementation of development work in the state and stressed that all-round infra projects and a host of development schemes have led to the emergence of new opportunities for the youth. With Tejashwi making a string of populist announcements, including a govt job for every household, Modi asked voters not to fall for the false promises and said Bihar will be developed as a tech hub in the years ahead. “The coming years are of unprecedented opportunities for youngsters. They won’t have to leave Bihar (for jobs),” he said. “Development not fear, progress not migration are part of conversations in Bihar now.”Saying that Naxalism had wreaked havoc in Bihar, Modi suggested that RJD had received help from Maoists.",PM Modi says people will not forget the 15-year RJD govt for 100 years. ‘Jungle raj’ was the constant theme in his interaction with five youths associated with BJP.

The main allegations are of seeking bribe in lieu of getting the change of land use (CLU) cleared or clearance of project for consideration.The controversy pertains to period when the state was ruled by Bhupinder Singh Hooda-led congress government.Rao Narender Singh, who had also served as health minister of Haryana, was booked by Haryana police on January 29, 2016, on the basis of a sting operation in lieu of granting CLU.He, along with four other leaders, was booked following the directions of the Lokayukta Haryana, where a complaint was filed seeking registration of an FIR against them after a sting operation was released in which all these leaders were found demanding money in lieu of CLU permission.On November 9, 2013, the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) had released a video CD in Chandigarh claiming that it featured the then Haryana health minister and Narnaul MLA Rao Narender allegedly negotiating for money to get change of land use (CLU) permission for a piece of land in Palwal district.He was later booked in January 2016 after an inquiry.Even after his appointment as Haryana congress chief by the Congress high command in September, the INLD had released the old video clip of Rao Narender Singh negotiating for CLU in a sting operation.In August 2024, the Haryana police claimed before the Punjab and Haryana High Court that the investigation in this matter was completed against them and soon a charge sheet would be filed after following the legal process.
