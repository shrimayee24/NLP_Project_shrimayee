Why BJP-Shiv Sena alliance talks fell apart in 2014? Devendra Fadnavis reveals what happened,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-bjp-shiv-sena-alliance-talks-fell-apart-in-2014-devendra-fadnavis-reveals-what-happened/articleshow/119451321.cms,"NEW DELHI: Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis explained why the Bharatiya Janata Party and Shiv Sena decided to part ways in 2014 state assembly elections. The saffron party leader revealed that seat-sharing disagreements were the primary reason behind the failure of alliance talks with Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena.""When the talks of alliance started, the Shiv Sena of that time had decided in its mind that it had to contest only 151 seats. Whereas our proposal was that we would contest on 127 seats and Shiv Sena would contest on 147 seats, we would give the remaining seats to our smaller alliance partners,"" he said speaking at an event in Mumbai.Fadnavis later revealed that the BJP had proposed a power-sharing arrangement where Shiv Sena would retain the chief minister's post. However, according to him, Shiv Sena was unwilling to compromise, leading to a deadlock in the negotiations.""Due to this reason, the matter could not move forward even though we explained to them a lot that we would contest on 127, and you contest on 147, you would have the chief minister, and we would have the deputy chief minister... They were not ready to have a settlement...,"" he added.In the 2014 Maharashtra assembly elections, both the BJP and the Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena contested separately.The BJP secured 122 seats, paving the way for Devendra Fadnavis to become the state's chief minister. Although the BJP and Shiv Sena had contested separately, they later joined forces post-election, with Shiv Sena becoming a key ally in the government.Thackeray's move to break ties with the BJP and form alliance with the Congress and NCP sparked internal dissent within Shiv Sena, ultimately fueling a rebellion led by Eknath Shinde.With the backing of BJP’s Devendra Fadnavis, Shinde orchestrated a split within the Shiv Sena in 2022 and aligned with the BJP to establish an NDA government.","Devendra Fadnavis says seat-sharing disagreements were the primary reason behind the failure of alliance talks with Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena. The BJP had proposed a power-sharing arrangement where Shiv SenA would retain the chief minister's post.

BJP members reacted vociferously to what they called Congress's conspiracy to change the Constitution to give religion-based quota to appease the minority community.Congress and Shivakumar denied that he had made such a statement and said govt functionaries were peddling lies to stall Parliament, but BJP's protests continued.Raising the issue in Lok Sabha, parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju said, ""A senior member of Congress, who is sitting on a constitutional position, has said that Muslims will be given reservation by changing the Constitution."" Amid uproar from opposition benches, the speaker adjourned the House for the second time since it assembled in the morning, till 2 pm.Rijiju said there was no place for reservation in the Constitution based on religion, and cited the demands made by the Muslim League in 1947 when Sardar Patel and the entire House had rejected religion-based quota. The minister demanded removal of the Congress member. .Ruckus continued in Rajya Sabha post-lunch as leader of the House J P Nadda and leader of opposition Mallikarjun Kharge engaged in a verbal duel over the issue.Nadda accused Congress of trying to create reservation for Muslims through the back door by cutting into the OBC quota, an allegation denied by Kharge, who said Shivakumar had never made any such statement.In a way, it was a re-run of the fight between the two sides during the campaign for 2024 LS polls where PM Modi had alleged that Congress was planning to smuggle in a Muslim quota, while Congress had accused of him of seeking a 400-plus tally so that the Constitution could be amended to get rid of caste quotas.The post-lunch sitting of RS, which followed two adjournments in the first half, started with Congress MPs raising a din and accusing the govt of misleading the House and twisting Shivakumar's words.An incensed Nadda got up to protest Karnataka govt's decision to give Muslims 4% reservation in public contracts, reminding the opposition benches that both B R Ambedkar and Sardar Patel had spoken against extending reservation on the basis of religion.""Earlier, Telangana assembly approved quota for Muslims by depriving SCs/STs/OBCs of their entitlement.

This is meant to assuage the feelings of Allahabad HC Bar Association against his repatriation.The collegium stuck to its decision to repatriate Justice Varma to Allahabad HC, despite criticism of the move, to insulate the inquiry from any attempt by the judge to interfere in the work of the three-judge panel, comprising Punjab and Haryana CJ Sheel Nagu, Himachal Pradesh CJ G S Sandhawalia and Karnataka HC's Justice Anu Sivaraman.

Bulldozers will target more buildings soon: Nagpur official

‘Remove dog statue at Shivaji memorial’

NAGPUR: Municipal bulldozers rolled into two Nagpur localities Monday morning, flattening two houses linked to suspects behind the riots on the night of March 17, including alleged mastermind Fahim Khan . The action, carried out under a security blanket of more than 150 police personnel and anti-riot squads, came just hours before Bombay high court's Nagpur bench halted demolitions of homes tied to the accused.Hours after the demolition began in the morning, Nagpur bench of HC issued a stay on demolitions and criticising the administration for its ""high-handedness"".The court's intervention followed petitions challenging Nagpur Municipal Corporation's action as unlawful and in violation of an SC ruling against punitive demolitions based on criminal allegations.By the time the Bombay high court's stay order was issued, alleged riot mastermind Fahim Khan's two-storey house near Raza Masjid in Sanjay Bagh Colony was already reduced to rubble. Another targeted property - owned by Abdul Hafiz Sheikh Lal in Johripura slum - had part of its structure demolished for unauthorised extensions. NMC cited violations under Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning (MRTP) Act, issuing 24-hour demolition notices on Sunday.Authorities are pushing ahead with their bulldozer policy after CM Devendra Fadnavis warned Saturday that properties of those responsible for the violence would be demolished. The clashes in central Nagpur left one dead, over 40 wounded and more than 50 vehicles damaged. Khan was taken into custody on March 19. A burqa seller and son of a cycle repair shop owner, he had contested the 2024 Lok Sabha elections against Union minister Nitin Gadkari, securing 1,000 votes.Khan has been charged with two cases of sedition. Police alleged that he spread inflammatory content through viral videos in the hours leading up to the riots, which erupted after demonstrations demanding the removal of Aurangzeb's tomb from Maharashtra's Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar district.In Sanjay Bagh Colony, NMC's anti-encroachment squad arrived at 8am, backed by a police cordon that locked down the neighbourhood. ""Despite the plot's lease expiring in 2020 and the layout being handed over to NMC, Khan built the multi-storey house without approval from the civic town planning department,"" an official said. By 10.40am, as the 24-hour deadline expired, the demolition began. Within two hours, Khan's home - registered under his 69-year-old mother Mehrunissa Khan - was gone. In the high court, petitioners led by Mehrunissa, said the structures had all necessary approvals dating back to 2003 and had never faced objections from municipal authorities - until now.""The NMC's demolition notice is not only arbitrary but also unconstitutional and amounts to targeted harassment and selective enforcement, which is legally impermissible,"" the petitioners claimed. They pointed to Supreme Court guidelines requiring the civic body to rebuild sanctioned homes if demolished unlawfully. The division bench of Justice Nitin Sambre and Justice Vrushali Joshi sought an explanation from the NMC commissioner for the razing of properties.A senior official said the crackdown followed a list provided by police, identifying 51 suspects in the riots, including eight top-priority targets. However, authorities struggled to directly link properties to the accused, as many were registered under family members. Authorities have issued a demolition notice to Aziza Begum Shaikh Salim, whose property in Yadav Nagar allegedly includes illegal extensions. Police linked the building to a relative accused in the riots. Officials said more properties will be targeted in the coming days as teams work to identifyunauthorised constructions linked to those accused of last week's violence.Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati, a descendant of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and former BJP RS MP, has called for removal of a dog’s statue near the Maratha king’s Samadhi at Raigad fort in Maharashtra.

Boxing Federation of India elections ‘paused’ due to legal hurdles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/boxing/boxing-federation-of-india-elections-paused-due-to-legal-hurdles/articleshow/119330505.cms,"Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

NEW DELHI: Facing legal hurdles after disgruntled member state associations approached courts, the Boxing Federation of India ’s ( BFI ) forthcoming elections were on Friday “paused” by Returning Officer RK Gauba after incumbent Ajay Singhled governing body informed the RO that it is seeking urgent intervention against the “contradictory orders” issued by the judiciary.The BFI’s elections are scheduled for March 28 in Gurugram.“The president of the BFI has communicated...since these orders have the potential to disrupt the ongoing electoral process/schedule, we are taking steps to approach the superior courts for urgent intervention. Therefore, it’s requested that further orders be awaited before the conflicting orders of the high courts are acted upon,” Gauba quoted Singh as saying in his order.The RO – a former Delhi high court judge – said that the election process would remain paused until the federation informs him of the steps taken in response to the court orders.“Thus, the process is paused till BFI informs of the action taken in the wake of the court orders,” Gauba wrote.Two days ago, the Delhi High Court had stayed the federation’s March 7 directive signed by Singh that “only duly-elected members of BFI’s affiliated units are authorised to represent their respective states in the elections”.The court had ruled on a petition filed by the Delhi Amateur Boxing Association (DABA), paving the way for its office-bearers Rohit Jainendra Jain and Neeraj Kant Bhatt to vote in the BFI’s annual general meeting (AGM) as Delhi boxing body’s representatives.On Thursday, another ruling by the Himachal Pradesh High Court allowed former sports minister Anurag Thakur to contest the BFI’s presidential election by staying his disqualification from the electoral college based on the March 7 circular, and directed Gauba to include the senior BJP leader’s name as one of the representatives from the Himachal boxing body to enable his candidature.It’s been learnt that the Maharashtra state boxing association has also filed a writ petition before the High Court of Judicature at Bombay, impleading the RO to stay the elections.",Boxing Federation of India ’s forthcoming elections were on Friday “paused’ by Returning Officer RK Gauba.

NEW DELHI: Boxing Federation of India’s (BFI) elections are heading towards an intriguing finish.Incumbent Ajay Singh and the opposing faction challenging his presidential candidacy are exercising every conceivable strategy to outmanoeuvre each other in this high-stakes electoral contest.After the initial triumph of having rejected former sports minister Anurag Thakur ’s bid to contest the federation’s elections following an unexpected office directive and suspending secretary general Hemanta Kalita and treasurer Digvijay Singh on allegations of corruption and favouritism, Singh-led BFI has been compelled to confront successive setbacks within a span of two days through various court orders, yielding the advantage to their opponents.On March 7, the Delhi high court had stayed the federation’s directive that only bonafide and duly-elected members of BFI’s affiliated units are authorised to represent their respective states in the forthcoming elections, scheduled for March 28 in Gurugram. The court had ruled on a petition filed by the Delhi Amateur Boxing Association (DABA), paving the way for its office bearers Rohit Jainendra Jain and Neeraj Kant Bhatt to vote in the BFI’s annual general meeting (AGM) as Delhi boxing body’s representatives.On Thursday, another ruling by the Himachal Pradesh high court allowed Thakur to contest the BFI’s presidential election by staying his disqualification from the electoral college based on the March 7 circular and directed Returning Officer – former Delhi high court judge R K Gauba – to include the senior BJP leader and four-time Lok Sabha MP’s name as one of the representatives from the Himachal boxing body to enable his candidature.A single judge bench of Justice Ajay Mohan Goel directed the BFI to extend the last date of submission of nominations so that Thakur can file his papers whilst permitting him to represent the Himachal Pradesh Boxing Association (HPBA) in the AGM and “fully participate therein”.Justice Goel ruled that the electoral college approved by the RO on March 12 and 13, which left out Thakur, “is prima facie bad and not sustainable in law”“In this backdrop, balance of convenience is also in favour of the petitioners and if interim, as prayed for by the petitioners is not granted, then irreparable loss shall be caused to them. As an ad-interim measure, this court stayed the operation of notice, dated 07.03.2025, as well as the rejection of nomination of one of the two nominated members namely, Mr. Anurag Singh Thakur. It also goes without saying that the election process will be subject to the final outcome of this writ petition or any other order that may be passed by the court in this application,” the order stated.The court ruled that prima facie, it was evident that the March 7 order by Singh was issued “without any authority and without any power”.Thakur was declared ineligible on the grounds that he wasn’t an elected member of the HPBA and can’t represent the state in the BFI’s AGM. The HPBA maintained that Thakur was an elected member of the state unit since 2008 and served “in different capacities, including chairman”.HPBA’s president Rajesh Bhandari will be another representative from the state, along with Thakur.Reacting to the development, a BFI source close to president Singh’s camp said that the next course of action will be decided after going through the 34-page order. “A lot will now depend on the RO. We have received both the court orders and the BFI’s legal team will go through them. We will certainly challenge them in the respective courts,” added the source.",Boxing Federation of India’s (BFI) elections are heading towards an intriguing finish.
