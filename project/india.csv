Supreme Court seeks Election Commission response on EVM verification SOPL,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-seeks-election-commission-response-on-evm-verification-sopl/articleshow/118161210.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amidst continued criticism of Electronic Voting Machines by opposition parties, the Supreme Court on Tuesday asked the Election Commission to explain whether it scrupulously followed the SC-laid down SOP for verification of authenticity of EVMs by engineers after the completion of polls.Asking the Election Commission not to delete data from the concerned EVMs, a bench of Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Dipankar Datta sought an affidavit from the EC by March 3 as Congress candidate Sarv Mitter, who lost to INLD candidate Arjun Chautala in the Rania assembly constituency of Haryana, complained through senior advocate Devadatt Kamat that the EC was “reluctant to allow scrutiny of burnt memory/microcontroller of EVMs"" and alleged that one EVM which was taken up for scrutiny showed the data empty.The same bench in its April 26, 20024 judgment in Association of Democratic Reforms had ordered that on the written request of candidates coming second and third in an election within seven days of declaration of results, “the burnt memory/microcontroller in 5% of the EVMs, that is, the control unit, ballot unit and the VVPAT, per assembly constituency/assembly segment of a parliamentary constituency shall be checked and verified by the team of engineers from the manufacturers of the EVMs, post the announcement of the results, for any tampering or modification.”The SC had also directed that “The District Election Officer, in consultation with the team of engineers, shall certify the authenticity/intactness of the burnt memory/microcontroller after the verification process is conducted. The actual cost or expenses for the said verification will be notified by the ECI, and the candidate making the said request will pay for such expenses.”Kamat said the SC in its April 2024 judgement had directed EC to devise a mechanism for checking and verification of the burnt memory and microcontroller of the EVMs but the EC “has completely failed to devise a proper mechanism and on the contrary issued directions contrary to the SC decision.”For the EC, senior advocate Maninder Singh said the SC has time and again reposed faith in the EVMs and their working and repelled attempts to take the country back to the days of paper ballot, which saw massive rigging and booth capturing by goons employed by politicians.He said the EC has scrupulously followed the SC-laid down mechanism for testing authenticity of the EVMs and argued that the other petitioner, Congress candidate Karan Singh Dalal who was defeated from Palwal assembly constituency, has filed another petition despite withdrawing an identical petition. The bench agreed with Singh and refused to entertain Dalal’s petition.Kamat said when Mitter sought verification of authenticity of EVMS in nine polling stations in Rania assembly constituency, the district election officer resorted to conducting a mock poll on the EVM used for the constituency and testing its burnt memory/microcontroller.The petitioner sought a direction to the EC to lay down a policy/memorandum for the checking and verification of original burnt memory/ microcontroller of the four components of the EVM (Control Unit, Ballot Unit, VVPAT and Symbol Loading Unit) in terms of the April 2024 judgment.","The Supreme Court asked the Election Commission to explain whether it scrupulously followed the SC-laid down SOP for verification of authenticity of EVMs. A bench of Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Dipankar Datta sought an affidavit from the EC by March 3.

SC refuses to test validity of state laws against cow trafficking and slaughter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-refuses-to-test-validity-of-state-laws-against-cow-trafficking-and-slaughter/articleshow/118161110.cms,"Supreme court

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to entertain a PIL, which alleged spiraling incidents of violence against Muslims by cow vigilante groups, saying it has already laid down mandatory guidelines for police to act against incidents of mob-lynching and that aggrieved persons must move jurisdictional High Courts for relief.“Sitting in Delhi we cannot monitor incidents happening in different areas of various states of the country. Such micromanagement is not feasible,” said a bench of Justices B R Gavai and K Vinod Chandran.However, it said that infraction of the guidelines to deal with incidents of mob-lynching laid down in the 2018 judgment in Tehseen Poonawalla case , which is bound to be implemented in letter and spirit by police and all other concerned authorities, then the aggrieved parties can move the concerned HCs seeking redressal of their grievances.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said the Bhartiya Nyaya Samhita has incorporated mob-lynching as a specific offence and it is the responsibility of the states to implement the criminal laws. “For every incident happening in the nook and corner of the country, a Pil cannot be filed directly in the Supreme Court bypassing the jurisdictional HCs,” he said.Appearing for petitioner National Federation of Indian Women, the women’s wing of CPI, advocate Nizamuddin Pasha told the bench that after the petitioner pointe out large number of incidents of cow vigilante groups targeting Muslims and the police registering cases against Muslims and not against those who indulged in violence, the court had sought affidavits from all states. The responses show non-implementation of Tehseen Poonawala guidelines.The bench turned to the other plea of the petitioner demanding minimum uniform compensation for victims of mob-lynching. It refused to do so saying the compensation cannot be the same for those suffering minor and grievous injuries. Fixing a minimum uniform compensation would take away the discretion of the courts and authorities to provide adequate amounts to victims, it said.The petitioner had also challenged provisions in laws enacted by 13 states which authorize even private persons to inspect premises on the suspicion of it being used for cow slaughter or cattle smuggling. It said statutory duties cannot be delegated to private people.However, the bench said each statutory provision must be tested individually and that the SC cannot enter an exercise for generic testing of validity of all these laws. Those aggrieved by the provisions these laws would have to move concerned state HC to challenge their validity.","Supreme Court refuses to entertain a PIL alleging spiraling incidents of violence against Muslims by cow vigilante groups.

No, it's just political talk Yes, it seems likely

NEW DELHI: Is Arvind Kejriwal , who suffered a humiliating defeat in the just-concluded Delhi assembly elections, planning a rejig in Punjab? Well, both the BJP and the Congress claim that the incumbent Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann is under pressure after the party's Delhi debacle.BJP leader and Union Minister Ravneet Singh Bittu on Tuesday took digs at Bhagwant Mann after the Punjab chief minister and his 91 MLAs met AAP chief Kejriwal in the national capital. ""A meeting was called to change the chief minister, but today’s media frames tell a different story. Have you ever seen Bhagwant Mann with his cabinet ministers? He used to speak alone in front of the media. For three years, no minister was ever seen with him in any media frame, but today, there was a large gathering with ministers standing proudly. This photo reveals what’s happening within the Aam Aadmi Party in Punjab,"" Bittu said.BJP's newly-elected MLA from West Delhi's Rajouri Garden, Manjinder Singh Sirsa also took a dig at Kejriwal for holding a meeting with Punjab MLAs despite AAP's defeat in Delhi. ""He is dreaming of becoming Punjab chief minister. Just like a fish out of water, Kejriwal can not live without power and luxury,"" Sirsa said. ""The people of Punjab are self-respecting and have mellowed the arrogance of many, so, Kejriwal should stop dreaming about becoming Punjab's CM,"" he added.The Congress also targeted Kejriwal and claimed that the AAP government in Punjab may soon see a change. Congress MP Gurjit Singh Aujla wondered why Punjab MLAs were called for meeting after a loss in Delhi.""He has lost Delhi, so he should call Delhi leaders and brainstorm, but Punjab MLAs have been called. Both his models, Punjab and Delhi, have failed. Arvind Kejriwal wants to become the chief minister or wants some changes. The people of Punjab are fed up with him, no matter how many meetings he holds, it will not make any difference,"" Congress MP Gurjit Singh Aujla said.Congress MP Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa claimed that the meeting shortly after the elections only showed that AAP would break soon. ""The results were declared on February 8 and the movement has already started. Calling a meeting so soon shows that they will break soon. There will be mid-term polls in Punjab. When a party loses, there is a discussion within the state, other states are not called. They are worried that what happened in Delhi may be repeated in Punjab,"" Singh said.Kejriwal's meeting with Punjab MLAs took place amid rumours of dissent within the state unit of the party.Bhagwant Mann, speaking to reporters after his meeting with Kejriwal, dismissed speculation about dissent within AAP's state unit, asserting that Congress leaders have a history of switching parties while AAP leaders remain dedicated. Mann's remarks came after Punjab Congress leader Partap Singh Bajwa claimed that over 30 AAP MLAs were in touch with his party.""Switching sides is Congress' culture; they talk about others but do not worry about themselves. I will ask Pratap Singh Bajwa how many MLAs they have in Delhi."" Mann said.""Bajwa has made such claims for years, let him say it ... He should not count our MLAs and instead, see how many MLAs Congress has in Delhi,"" he said.After losing Delhi, AAP has government only in Punjab. There are speculations that Kejriwal may play a bigger role in Punjab politics. AAP leaders have dismissed such reports.AAP, which ruled Delhi for a decade, suffered a major setback in the February 5 elections, losing 40 seats and its government in the national capital. The AAP could win only 22 seats in the 70-member assembly, while the BJP with 48 seats is all set to form its government in Delhi.Assembly elections are due in Punjab in about two years time in 2027.

NEW DELHI/CHANDIGARH: AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal has called Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann, ministers and party MLAs to Delhi for deliberations on Tuesday, in a move that was not only seen as aimed at insulating its government but also termed by rivals as ""preparation"" for the removal of Mann from the top post.Although AAP termed it an ""organisational meeting"" for feedback and acknowledging work done by Mann and Punjab MLAs in Delhi polls, it intensified speculation about unrest in the party over failure to deliver its poll promises and growing tensions between Kejriwal and Mann. AAP Punjab netas will attend along with party members from Delhi.Stirring the pot, BJP's Tarun Chugh claimed ""countdown for Mann's government has started"", while party MLA Majinder Sirsa cautioned the CM on ""plans afoot to remove him"".Congress talked about the imminent prospect of mid-term polls in Punjab. ""More than 30 AAP MLAs in Punjab are in touch with us,"" said leader of opposition in Punjab, Partap Singh Bajwa, while Congress MP from Gurdaspur Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa predicted mid-term polls. ""It depends on how many AAP MLAs switch sides. Congress is the only option for AAP MLAs as BJP has no future in state,"" he said.AAP senior spokesperson Neel Garg, however, accused Sirsa of ""rumour mongering"" to please BJP leadership as he was in race for Delhi CM's post.

NEW DELHI: BJP scored a spectacular victory in all parliamentary constituency areas to win 48 of the 70 assembly seats in the capital. In particular, it was the party's performance in outer Delhi, areas bordering Haryana, that helped it rout AAP and storm back to power after 27 years. AAP, for its part, continued its impressive run in Muslim- and Dalit-dominated seats apart from winning isolated pockets with a higher number of JJ clusters and unauthorised colonies.BJP triumphed in nine of the 10 seats in the West Delhi parliamentary constituency, eight each in North West Delhi and East Delhi and seven in New Delhi. The remaining seats came from Chandni Chowk, where six of its candidates emerged victorious, and five each in South Delhi and North East Delhi.In the 2020 assembly polls, when BJP tallied just eight seats, the party had failed to win a single seat in New Delhi, West Delhi, South Delhi and Chandni Chowk. While one BJP candidate was elected from North West Delhi, three each returned from East Delhi and North East Delhi.BJP, thus, not only made inroads in urban pockets of central Delhi and New Delhi this time, but also almost swept the outer Delhi areas and rural parts of the city. ""Of the 13 seats that share a border with Uttar Pradesh, we got seven while of the 11 constituencies on the border with Haryana, we won nine,"" smiled a BJP functionary.Narela, Mundka, Badli, Najafgarh, Palam, Bijwasan, Matiala, Chhatarpur and Mehrauli were some of the prominent rural seats where BJP had failed to do anything impressive in the last two elections but where it performed extremely well this year. Surender Solanki, chief of Palam 360 Khap, said the rural voters came out in large numbers to support BJP. ""The villages, be it rural or urban, were completely ignored by Delhi govt. We ran a campaign, visited every single city village, interacted with the residents and prepared a list of demands. We approached all political parties. While AAP continued to ignore us, the PM called us as did the Union home minister and assured us our issues will be addressed. The Khap, accordingly, supported BJP,"" said Solanki.The Khap chief added that BJP managed to wrest several seats with the support of the villagers from AAP, which itself had grabbed them from Congress in 2013.AAP held on to its support base in reserved constituencies. While the party had won all 12 SC seats in 2015 and 2020, it retained eight seats this time. Similarly, people came out in large numbers in constituencies dotted with unauthorised colonies in its support. Gokalpur, Ambedkar Nagar, Kondli, Okhla, Badarpur, Tughlaqabad, Deoli, Kirari, Burari and Sultanpur Majra are known for having large clusters of unauthorised colonies.An AAP functionary explained why. ""In our campaign, we highlighted the work done by our govt to improve the amenities in the city's 1,797 unauthorised colonies. We connected these colonies with sewer and water pipelines, laid down roads, built drains and improved overall living conditions. The support we got from the residents of some of such colonies is a validation of our work.""While the Muslim vote showed signs of division in a couple of constituencies, it largely went in the favour of AAP, getting big victories for its candidates. Except Mustafabad, where the Hindu votes consolidated against a trifurcation of Muslims votes, AAP won comprehensively in Okhla, Seelampur, Matia Mahal and Ballimaran. It also performed reasonably well in areas where Muslims live in large numbers but are not the deciding force, such as at Kirari and Seemapuri.Despite being the partners in the INDIA bloc, a grouping of opposition parties at the national level, AAP and Congress contested the assembly election separately. This was to BJP's advantage. According to an analysis, there are 14 seats that BJP won because Congress garnered more votes than the margin between the winner and the closest rival. These seats are Timarpur, Badli, Nangloi Jat, Madipur, Rajendra Nagar, New Delhi, Jangpura, Kasturba Nagar, Malviya Nagar, Mehrauli, Chhatarpur, Sangam Vihar, Greater Kailash and Trilokpuri.Some political observers believed that had Congress and AAP contested the election as alliance partners, the results could have been different. Although the vote cutting by Congress was evident in its candidates saving their security deposits only in Kasturba Nagar, Badli and Nangloi Jat, a Congress functionary refused to accept the theory. ""We contested the Lok Sabha election jointly and the result was we failed to win a single seat. Theoretically, one can say that the alliance could have prevented the BJP juggernaut, but the results could have been totally different too,"" the Congress member argued.","BJP scored a spectacular victory in all parliamentary constituency areas to win 48 of the 70 assembly seats in the capital.

violated: SC

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has ruled that investigating agencies are duty-bound to inform grounds of arrest to the accused while taking them into custody and failure to comply with it would render the arrest illegal. It said the requirement to inform the grounds of arrest is not a ""formality but a mandatory constitutional requirement"".A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and N K Singh quashed an arrest made by Gurgaon police, saying the accused had not been not informed of the grounds of his arrest. Though the court refrained from passing an order on the mode of communication of grounds of arrest, it said it would be better if it was communicated in writing as the burden would be on the police to prove that the grounds of arrest were communicated.In a concurring but separate order, Justice Singh said the requirement of communicating the grounds of arrest in writing is not only to the arrested person, but also to friends, relatives or such other person as may be disclosed or nominated by the arrested person.. The court said the right to be informed about the grounds of arrest flows from Article 22(1) of the Constitution and any infringement of this fundamental right would vitiate the process of arrest and remand. It said a police officer cannot ""casually"" arrest a person in a cognisable offence, and that it could be done only when credible information was received.The bench said, ""Thus, the requirement of informing the person arrested of the grounds of arrest is not a formality but a mandatory constitutional requirement. Article 22 is included in Part III of the Constitution under the heading of Fundamental Rights . Thus, it is the fundamental right of every person arrested and detained in custody to be informed of the grounds of arrest as soon as possible.""If the grounds of arrest are not informed as soon as may be after the arrest, it would amount to a violation of the fundamental right of the arrestee guaranteed under Article 22(1). It will also amount to depriving the arrestee of his liberty. The reason is that, as provided in Article 21, no person can be deprived of his liberty except in accordance with the procedure established by law.""It further said, ""The procedure established by law also includes what is provided in Article 22(1). Therefore, when a person is arrested without a warrant, and the grounds of arrest are not informed to him as soon as may be after the arrest, it will amount to a violation of his fundamental right guaranteed under Article 21 as well.""The court said the grounds of arrest must be informed in a language which the arrestee understands and held that it is the duty of the courts to ascertain whether compliance with Article 22(1) and other mandatory safeguards has been made while remanding the accused.""When a violation of Article 22(1) is established, it is the duty of the court to forthwith order the release of the accused. That will be a ground to grant bail even if statutory restrictions on the grant of bail exist. The statutory restrictions do not affect the power of the court to grant bail when the violation of Articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution is established,"" it said.","Supreme Court quashed an arrest made by Gurgaon police, saying the accused had not been not informed of the grounds of his arrest.

NEW DELHI: Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann on Tuesday dismissed claims by Congress and BJP of unrest brewing among AAP MLAs, tamping down speculation that the ripples from AAP's Delhi debacle may pose a risk to his govt.Talking to reporters after the surprise move of party boss Arvind Kejriwal to summon Punjab CM, ministers, MPs and MLAs to Delhi, Mann took on Congress and said ""switching sides is Congress's culture"" and reminded Partap Singh Bajwa, the leader of opposition in Punjab, that his party drew a blank in Delhi.Ahead of the meeting, which AAP said was attended by all 92 Punjab MLAs, Bajwa had alleged that the party was preparing the ground to oust Mann from the CM's post. He had also claimed that over 30 AAP MLAs were in touch with his party.Instead of counting our MLAs, he should see how many Congress candidates won in Delhi,"" Bhagwant Mann said. Kejriwal and other senior functionaries held a meeting with Punjab functionaries to ostensibly thank them for their involvement in Delhi campaign.According to AAP, the meeting at Kapurthala House saw all MLAs from Punjab and MPs from the state come together in what the party projected as a show of solidarity and normalcy amid the gloom of the Delhi loss. Besides Kejriwal and former deputy CM Manish Sisodia, national organisational secretary and Rajya Sabha MP Sandeep Pathak and RS MP Raghav Chadha were present.Kejriwal is learnt to have asked the Punjab MLAs to reconnect with voters while working unitedly to pave the way for AAP's return to office in 2027. The timing of the meeting following AAP's defeat in Delhi had sparked speculation about instability in the party's Punjab unit. Asked about Bajwa's allegation that he could quit AAP with a group of MLAs, Mann said, ""Let them say so. We cultivated the party with hard work by going to every nook and corner of the state. They don't worry about their own party and find fault with others. It is Congress that has a culture of switching parties.""BJP's newly-elected Rajouri Garden MLA Manjinder Singh Sirsa claimed Mann's ""nervousness and body language"" after the meeting ""supports the conspiracy theory"" that he had spoken of on Monday.
