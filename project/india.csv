In keeping with the trend seen since the Lok Sabha elections, after AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal’s name, his wife Sunita is firmly pitched at No.2 on the list of campaigners submitted for approval to the Election Commission on Saturday.One finds Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann’s name next on the list followed by former deputy CM Manish Sisodia who came out on bail earlier this month in the Delhi excise policy scam case and has since been out among people holding 'padyatras'. According to the party he will be stepping out of the Delhi more and more now for campaigning now.The list of seven seats in J&K for which candidates were announced by party general secretary (organisation) Sandeep Pathak include Pulwama, Rajpora, Devsar, Dooru, Doda, Doda West and Banihal.The list of 40 star campaigners announced later in the evening on Sunday also includes senior AAP leaders Pankaj Gupta, Rajya Sabha MPs Sanjay Singh, Sandeep Pathak, Raghav Chadha, ND Gupta and Delhi ministers Gopal Rai, Atishi, Saurabh Bhardwaj, Imran Hussain, Kailash Gehlot and former health minister Satyendar Jain.On Sunita Kejriwal continuing to stay at the top of the list of star campaigners even after Lok sabha polls as is being seen in Haryana and now in the J&K list, AAP sources say that this is strategically aimed at conveying to the people that Arvind Kejriwal is very much listening to their concerns through his wife who shares what the public feels with him when she visits him in Tihar jail. Kejriwal was arrested and is in jail in connection with a money laundering case related to the now scrapped Delhi liquor policy. The Supreme Court will be hearing his bail pleas on Sep 6.“The party feels that public feedback reflects that people see Arvind Kejriwal as the face of AAP and his wife as a star campaigner helps establish that connect which people are looking for with the Delhi CM and AAP national convenor,” sources said.Party leaders also feel that Sunita Kejriwal’s prominence on the star campaigner list is in no way a reflection on the status of other top leaders like Sisodia who, party sources say, is firmly stepping up the outreach among people since he came out on bail. On Sunday, Sisodia visited Punjab for the first time since his release from jail. He was seen offering prayers at Golden Temple with his family and visiting Wagah border along with Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann.","Aam Aadmi Party on Sunday also shared its list of 40 star campaigners for the state.

It was seen to have worked for Congress in Himachal Pradesh , where govt employees have traditionally wielded disproportionate influence.The party, however, escaped any damage in Madhya Pradesh as it comprehensively won both Lok Sabha and assembly polls in the state.Although it was less of an issue in the Lok Sabha polls, the unhappiness of a section of vocal govt employees was palpable. Many observers speculated that it could be a factor in upcoming poll battles.Nearly 18 months in the making, the decision to implement the Unified Pension Scheme ( UPS ) has come ahead of assembly polls in Haryana and Jammu and Kashmir, dates for which have been announced. Assembly polls in Maharashtra and Jharkhand are also due this year.Although Congress had vigorously advocated OPS in assembly polls, it was silent on OPS after the electoral setback in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, and did not even mention it in the LS poll manifesto.Union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, while elaborating upon the Cabinet decision on the scheme, referred to how Congress made it a big poll issue in Himachal and Rajasthan, but OPS was never implemented by the party in the states, making it ""an illusion"".""Congress has always been insensitive towards employees, which is reflected in Himachal and Rajasthan. The party made promises in both the states but failed to implement the OPS... their politics of creating illusions was once again exposed,"" Vaishnaw said.He further said that the UPS, on the other hand, was a well thought through scheme under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi as it is fully funded by the state and promises intergenerational equality. ""Besides, funds will be provided based on the current requirement, leaving nothing for future, unlike what Congress did in Himachal and Rajasthan,"" the minister said, while dismissing suggestions that it was a political call.","Bhartiya Janata Party expecting political gains from govt employees.
