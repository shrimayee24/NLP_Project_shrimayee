ED plans to raid me: Rahul. Bid to hide Wayanad inaction: BJP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ed-plans-to-raid-me-rahul-bid-to-hide-wayanad-inaction-bjp/articleshow/112233880.cms,"NEW DELHI: Congress MP Rahul Gandhi on Friday claimed the Centre was planning an Enforcement Directorate raid on him because it was angry with his "" chakravyuh "" comment, a claim which triggered day-long speculation and commentary besides leading BJP to jibe that the leader of opposition's charge was a gimmick aimed at distracting attention from the criticism he is facing over the Wayanad tragedy .Rahul wrote on X, ""Apparently, 2 in 1 didn't like my chakravyuh speech. ED 'insiders' tell me a raid is being planned. Waiting with open arms, director, ED... chai and biscuits on me.""The ""2 in 1"" was widely viewed as a reference to PM Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah. Rahul, who is on bail in a money laundering case related to the National Herald scam, had used the ""chakravyuh"" metaphor in a scathing attack on the Modi govt and BJP during a speech on Budget on Monday.BJP's response was swift and hard-hitting. Former Union minister Anurag Thakur said Rahul's ""wild claim"" was a gimmick and accused the Congress MP of glossing over the fact that he is on bail in the National Herald case, with the court rejecting his claim of innocence after examining evidence. ""By claiming to have been tipped off by ED insiders, he has reduced himself to be a clone of Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal who was notorious for trying similar PR gimmicks. He should pause and see what happened to Kejriwal's credibility,"" he said.Thakur's colleague, former Union minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar, charged Rahul with raising an ""imaginary issue"" to avoid questions related to Wayanad. ""Rahul Gandhi might have been told that people are asking questions about his accountability so he has sought to create a new narrative. The local MP is the last person to reach there,"" he told reporters.Immediately after Rahul's tweet, Congress whip in Lok Sabha Manickam Tagore submitted an adjournment motion on ""BJP govt's misuse of agencies like ED, CBI, and income tax department for political harassment"". The notice said despite BJP's reduced numbers from 303 to 240 seats and its reliance on TDP and JDU, the govt was not giving up on its policy of using agencies for ""political intimidation"".BJP also fired volleys through the day. ""As MP of Wayanad for five years, you (Rahul) did nothing to save the people from potential landslides. In Feb 2023, Isro placed Wayanad at 13th place in a list of 147 districts on the Landslide Atlas of India. It still didn't move you. Now, don't shed crocodile tears,"" BJP's IT department head Amit Malviya said on X.The saffron party also shared a video of Rahul's visit to Wayanad where he was stopped by locals who said, ""Brother, ask him to stop the car. We are the people who voted for him and made him win... He was the MP of this place. If he is so concerned about not getting out of the car and dirtying his feet in the mud, why has he come here? What is there to see here?""""Angry protestors accost third time fail Rahul Gandhi on his visit to Wayanad,"" Malviya said in another post.Congress was tight-lipped about the possible provocation behind Rahul's claim, with MP Shashi Tharoor saying the leader of opposition must have got some information which prompted him to put out the social media post. ""He keeps saying 'daro mat'. He is not worried,"" the Kerala MP said.","Rahul wrote on X, ""Apparently, 2 in 1 didn't like my chakravyuh speech. ED 'insiders' tell me a raid is being planned. Waiting with open arms, director, ED... chai and biscuits on me"" The ""2 in 1"" was widely viewed as a reference to PM Narendra Modi and Amit Shah.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112233925,imgsize-975994,width-400,resizemode-4/112233925.jpg"

To ensure this, we shall implement the recommendations of the high-level committee of experts as soon as they are submitted,"" Pradhan added.BJP's Amit Malviya said, ""Third time fail Rahul Gandhi must apologise to the nation on the floor of Parliament. He purposely used the opportunity to destroy the confidence of students' in the country's examination system for political gain... just like he is trying to weaken people's faith in other institutions like the armed forces, judiciary and EC. He must apologise to the student community and keep them off his sinister, ugly politics.""On July 22, Rahul had said in Lok Sabha, ""There are millions of students who are extremely concerned, and they are convinced the Indian examination system is a fraud. They believe that if you are rich and have money, you can buy the examination system.""

They added that K V Thomas took over the post after the BJP came to power in 2014, and Kharge succeeded him only in 2017 because of ""practical reasons"".The PAC chairman gets an office in the Parliament along with secretarial staff, which the LOP too is entitled to.
