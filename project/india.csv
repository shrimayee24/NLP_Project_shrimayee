LIVE: AAP Convenor Arvind Kejriwal PC | BJP | Amit Shah | Delhi | Election 2025 | Jhuggi Basti

NEW DELHI: AAP supremo and former Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal launched a sharp attack on Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday, challenging him to withdraw cases against slum dwellers and guarantee housing for them. Kejriwal said that he would not contest the upcoming Delhi assembly elections if Shah fulfilled his demands.“Withdraw all the cases filed against slum residents and submit an affidavit in court guaranteeing that they will receive houses on the same land from which they were evicted. If you do this, I will not contest the elections. I challenge you to accept this. Otherwise, let it be clear—Kejriwal is here to stay,” he said during a press conference in the Shakur Basti area.Accusing the BJP of prioritising land acquisition over the welfare of slum residents, Kejriwal alleged that the saffron party was only seeking votes while planning to displace residents after the elections. “They are after your votes now, but after the elections, they’ll be after your land,” he said.The AAP leader also targeted the BJP’s 'Jahan Jhuggi Wahan Makaan' scheme as a hollow promise, claiming that only 4,700 flats had been constructed for slum dwellers over the past five years. He accused the BJP of intending to clear slums without addressing the residents’ housing concerns. “They want to grab the land and have no regard for the people living there,” he said.Kejriwal was joined by senior AAP leader Satyendar Jain , who is contesting from the Shakur Basti constituency for the fourth consecutive time. Jain previously won the seat in 2013, 2015, and 2020.The Delhi assembly elections are set for February 5, with results to be announced on February 8. AAP, which won 62 out of 70 seats in 2020, is aiming for a third consecutive full term in office.",AAP supremo and former Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal launched a sharp attack on Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: In an attack from within the party ahead of the Delhi elections , sitting BJP MLA Mohan Singh Bisht on Sunday openly criticized his party's decision to field Kapil Mishra from the Karawal Nagar assembly seat .“Clearly the party thinks it's a BJP seat and they think ""BJP mei kisi aira gaira natthu khaira- kiso ko bhi lada denge who jeet jaayega (they will field anyone from BJP and he will win)"". This is a big mistake,"" Bisht remarked in a statement to ANI.He further called out the BJP saying, ""In the coming days, the party will know the importance of ground workers' existence in these elections."" ""Not just this election, be it Burari, Karawal Nagar, Ghonda, Seelampur, Gokalpuri and Nand Nagri seats; what'll happen on all these seats, only time will tell"" he added, talking about the consequences of the party's decisions.Further declaring his loyalty to Karawal Nagar, Bisht asserted, “I will not contest from any other seat. I will file my nomination from the Karawal Nagar seat, before January 17.” He also said that he'll not ask the party to reconsider the decision and will not take any incentive to fight from any other seat.However, later in the evening, BJP released a third list with just Bisht's name, fielding him from Mustafabad.Meanwhile, despite his discontentment with BJP, the MLA still ruled out any possibility of joining Congress.This comes as BJP on Saturday nominated ex-AAP member Kapil Mishra as their candidate for Karawal Nagar constituency instead of five-time and incumbent MLA Bisht.

NEW DELHI: Delhi BJP chief Virendra Sachdeva on Sunday launched a sharp salvo at AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal , accusing him of attempting to incite ""religious conflict"" in the capital ahead of Delhi assembly elections . Sachdeva alleged that Kejriwal wrote to the Election Commission, requesting the removal of Dalit voters from the Valmiki Temple area in Gol Market.""Arvind Kejriwal wants to incite religious conflict in Delhi. He has requested the Election Commission to cut the votes of 44 Dalit voters near Valmiki Temple. Why? Because they are Dalits,"" Sachdeva claimed, adding that Kejriwal had previously insulted Purvanchalis and was now targeting Dalits to further caste politics.Sachdeva also highlighted alleged bias in Kejriwal's approach. ""There is a Mazar near the Valmiki Temple with 60 registered voters, none of whom live in the area, but Kejriwal has not requested their removal. He is targeting Hindu Dalits instead,"" he alleged.BJP Patel Nagar candidate Raaj Kumar Anand echoed these sentiments, claiming Kejriwal was under pressure.

Anand asked.BJP national general secretary Tarun Chugh also launched a scathing attack, calling Kejriwal the ""kingpin"" of the alleged liquor scam.
