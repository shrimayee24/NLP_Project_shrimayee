"TMC LS chief whip Kalyan Banerjee attacks colleagues, no holds barred",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tmc-ls-chief-whip-kalyan-banerjee-attacks-colleagues-no-holds-barred/articleshow/120108085.cms,"KOLKATA: Stoked by veteran Trinamool MP Sougata Ray 's ""he should be removed as (party's Lok Sabha) chief whip and none (in the party) likes him"" comment and his WhatsApp texts in a closed group being gleefully shared by Bengal BJP, TMC MP and senior lawyer Kalyan Banerjee launched an unprecedented fusillade against a party MP, whom he did not name. In subsequent attacks, Banerjee did not spare Ray, and Kirti Azad, another TMC MP.In a no-holds-barred attack, Banerjee questioned how a woman MP could ask BSF personnel at Nirvachan Sadan ""to arrest him"" and refer to him as a ""chhotolok"". Banerjee also referred to Ray's role in the Narada sting tapes and hit out at Azad for ""advocating for a sweet shop"". He said he had complained to the party's ""top leadership"".The issue referred to the April 4 deputation by TMC MPs to EC on the duplicate EPIC issue. Party MP Mahua Moitra , who was to be part of the delegation, arrived there to find her name missing from the list of signatories.Banerjee claimed he did ""only as instructed"" and said he asked Moitra not to make it an issue. ""She shouted at me, and so did I,"" he added.""The allegations that I denigrated her (as a woman) and abused her are false. There can be heated arguments among colleagues too, that is not the issue, but she asked the BSF (posted at EC) to arrest me. How can she say that? I am in politics for 40 years. I have all along fought against CPM, Congress and now BJP. She only speaks of Adani-Modi and not against a single BJP functionary. I protested that strongly, and yes, I spoke loudly,"" Banerjee said.Moitra, in Nadia, couldn't be reached for comment. Since the controversy, she has not spoken about it in public.On April 4, Banerjee apparently wrote about this in a WhatsApp group that only TMC MPs have access to. On Tuesday, BJP's Amit Malviya, and later Bengal BJP, shared on X WA screenshots and videos on the incident.The videos showed Banerjee shouting at his colleagues while entering EC office as party netas tried to calm him down. In the WA chats, Banerjee was seen having a tiff with Azad with the former referring to an unknown ""versatile international lady."" In the purported chats, Banerjee had posted a message saying he had reached Kolkata.Then he added, ""Send your BSF and Delhi Police to arrest me. Your home ministry connection is very strong international great lady.""If this was the first trigger for Banerjee's outburst, the second was Ray when he confirmed the BJP allegations. Ray told reporters Banerjee should be removed as the chief whip of TMC in LS. ""But I leave it to Mamata Banerjee's judgment. That Kalyan is not fit to be in the post is apparent to me. I've not said it so far, but because of his behaviour and his incorrect English... I think the time has arrived to see into it,"" Ray said.Banerjee was belligerent in his attack on Ray, referring to the fact that the MP had accepted Narada cash and questioned his integrity.","Kalyan Banerjee launched an unprecedented fusillade against a party MP, whom he did not name.

A third is on the run.Police said they were acting at the behest of an ISI-backed terror module involving Zeeshan Akhtar, an associate of jailed gangster Bishnoi, and Pakistan-based Shahzad Bhatti.BJP neta Manoranjan Kalia, who was at his Jalandhar home when the grenade attack occurred around 1.03am on Tuesday, initially mistook it for a transformer blast.It was only when he saw dust and smoke in the courtyard that the BJP functionary realised something was amiss.The ex-minister's Innova, a parked motorbike, an aluminium door and some glass windows were damaged in the explosion.""I called the commissioner of police and the ACP, but they did not take my calls. So, I sent my security guard to the police station barely 300 yards from my home to report the blast,"" Kalia said.Suspected mastermind Zeeshan, whose roots are in Shankar village of Jalandhar's Nakodar subdivision, is an accused in the Oct 12, 2024 murder of former Maharashtra minister and NCP functionary Baba Siddique in Mumbai.He is also a suspect in a March 16 grenade attack on the house of UK-based social media influencer Navdeep Singh Roger Sandhu's in-laws in Jalandhar's Raipur Rasoolpur. On that occasion, the grenade didn't explode.Bhatti named Zeeshan and gangster Happy Passia, who is believed to be based in the US and has links with Babbar Khalsa International (BKI) terrorist Harwinder Rinda, as his accomplices in the attack targeting the house of Sandhu's in-laws. He accused Sandhu of producing social media content denigrating Islam.In June 2024, a purported video call between Bhatti and Bishnoi surfaced online, reinforcing suspicions about their collaboration. This Feb, another video showed Zeeshan addressing Bhatti as ""an elder brother"" and thanking him for assisting in his escape from India.A senior police officer said Zeeshan was possibly in Europe.Before allegedly orchestrating the grenade attack on Kalia's residence, Zeeshan had at least 10 criminal cases filed against him between Sep 3, 2021, and March 16 this year for offences ranging from murder to violation of the Arms Act. Zeeshan, whose aliases include Mohammad Jaseen, Jaisy Silander and Jazzy, is 21 and has served time in jails in Punjab.At a presser in Chandigarh, Punjab's special DGP (law & order) Arpit Shukla said police cracked the grenade attack case within 12 hours. He said investigators were verifying leads about the suspects having links with Pakistan-based BKI and gangster Happy Passia.An FIR was registered under sections 109 (attempt to murder), 324 (3) (mischief causing loss or damage to any property) and 61(2) (criminal conspiracy) of the new penal code BNS and the Explosive Substances Act.BJP and AAP jousted over the attack on Kalia's home, with the saffron party demanding CM Bhagwant Mann's resignation. BJP workers staged a protest in Patiala to condemn the attack. Minister Mohinder Bhagat, who visited the BJP national executive member's house, blamed the Union govt for ""activities orchestrated by Lawrence Bishnoi from jail in collaboration with Pakistan"".Late Tuesday, Praveen Kumar Sinha, a 1994-batch IPS officer and additional DGP, was named as Punjab's new intelligence chief.

'Just because the woman MP speaks fluent English doesn't mean she can insult anybody'

'He misbehaves and insults everyone'

NEW DELHI: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has an onerous task at hand. The Trinamool chief needs to identify the black sheep in the party who leaked videos and purported chats of an ugly spat between her senior MPs - first at the office of Election Commission and then on the WhatsApp group of the party MPs.Mamata and her party have been left embarrassed after BJP leader Amit Malviya shared story of alleged infighting between leaders of the Trinamool Congress along with video clips and WhatsApp chats on his X handle.Read also: Feud within TMC? Kalyan Banerjee blames Kirti Azad for leaking 'infighting' WhatsApp chats The BJP leader claimed that two Trinamool MPs had a public spat in the precincts of the Election Commission of India on April 4, 2025 - the day a Trinamool delegation had gone to the EC office to submit a memorandum.""It all started after one MP, who was carrying the memorandum, went to the EC office directly ignoring party's instruction to first meet other members of the delegation at party's Parliament office to get the document signed by all of them. This angered the other MP, who confronted him when they came face to face at the commission office,"" Amit Malviya wrote in his post on X.""Later the fight continued in the ‘AITC MP 2024’ WhatsApp group with MPs trading barbs at each other,"" he added.Read Also: 'Just because she speaks fluent English ...': Kalyan Banerjee blames 'woman MP' for public spat The leaked video shows a visibly agitated TMC MP Kalyan Banerjee taking out his anger while other party leaders try to pacify him and calm him down.Kalyan Banerjee continues with his rant even when prodded that the media is watching his actions. ""So what! I want the media to see this,"" says Kalyan Banerjee when he is warned about media presence. The TMC MP goes on to say that he will not tolerate such things as he has not come through quota or from any other party.Then the fight spilled on to the WhatsApp group of the Trinamool MPs where Kalyan Banerjee and Kirti Azad - who joined Mamata's party in 2021, engage in an ugly spat.Ironically, the purported WhatsApp conversations not just brings to fore the infighting within the party, but also indicate that not two but three MPs were involved in the incident.In the chat, Kalyan Banerjee refers to a ""versatile international lady"" and makes several strong comments on her. When Kirti Azad confronts him, he vents out his anger against him.Later, speaking to reporters in Kolkata, Kalyan Banerjee admitted that an altercation did take place, but pinned the blame on a woman MP - whom he did not name.""I have been in politics for the last 40 years. This woman MP was asking the security personnel outside the EC office to arrest me. Who are they to send me to jail? She hurled abuses towards me. It is I who fight in Parliament; I am not someone who is only obsessed with a specific industrial house,” he said.""Just because the woman MP speaks fluent English doesn't mean she can insult anybody,” added Kalyan Banerjee, who is also the party's chief whip in the Lok Sabha.Following the altercation, the woman MP exited the WhatsApp group and sent letters to both Mamata Banerjee and TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee, news agency PTI said citing sources.A senior TMC leader, who requested anonymity, told PTI the argument occurred last week when a party delegation had gone to the EC to submit a memorandum.“After the TMC delegation arrived at the EC office, Kalyan Banerjee had a verbal spat with the woman MP over the signing of the memorandum. She then asked the security personnel to intervene and demanded his arrest, alleging misconduct towards a woman parliamentarian,” he said.The matter further escalated when Kalyan Banerjee and Kirti Azad had an argument on the MPs' WhatsApp group.""It was Kirti Azad who provoked me and was lecturing me on what to do. He has leaked the WhatsApp chats,"" Kalyan Banerjee claimed.Reacting to the controversy, senior TMC MP Sougata Roy blamed Kalyan Banerjee for tarnishing the party's image.“What he has done has maligned the party. Party should immediately remove Kalyan Banerjee from the post of chief whip. He misbehaves and insults everyone in the party. It must take stern action against him,” Roy told reporters.Roy also said that he saw Mahua Moitra crying after the spat. ""I was not there when this altercation between Kalyan Banerjee and Mahua Moitra took place. I was at Vijay Chowk and the spat took place in front of the Election Commission office. I saw Mahua crying and complaining to several MPs, of other parties also, about Kalyan's behaviour.""Clearly, for Mamata Banerjee, who is gearing up for the assembly elections next year, this public display of infighting within the party is the last thing she would want. More so, when the school jobs scam has already given the BJP a strong weapon to nail her and the Trinamool.",BJP leader Amit Malviya shared story of alleged infighting between leaders of the Trinamool Congress along with video clips and WhatsApp chats on his X handle.

NEW DELHI: A defiant V Senthil Balaji , who was reappointed as minister in the M K Stalin govt after being released on bail, has told Supreme Court that he could continue to be part of the Tamil Nadu cabinet because ""he enjoys popular mandate and he cannot be chastised for seeking a political office in pursuance of the popular mandate"".Responding to the court's query on how he could take charge of a ministry immediately after being granted bail as his holding the post could influence witnesses, Balaji, who is facing serious corruption charges , asserted that courts could not read into the Constitution a disqualification in appointment of a minister.In an affidavit, the TN minister said he had been scrupulously following bail conditions fixed by the court and no case was made out to recall the order granting him bail. Opposing the contention that his continuation as minister may influence witnesses in the case, he said, ""The entirety of criminal prosecution (state as well as by ED) came to be instituted against Respondent No.2 (him) while he was a minister in power and he even suffered adverse judicial orders. If the alleged influence of the minister was so strong, the prosecution would not have come to be launched and continued against him.""The case takes on significance as ministers in many other govts, including former Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, held on to their positions during the period they were in jail. Balaji's affidavit further said, ""Even this court was acutely aware of the magnitude of the scheduled offence trials, and that they would take many years to conclude, and by its own estimation, at the very least three to four years or even more. Therefore, any exercise to modify the bail conditions would necessarily have to consider that Respondent No.2 enjoys popular mandate and he cannot be chastised for seeking a political office in pursuance of the popular mandate. This would not only be contrary to the popular mandate but would also be violative of his cherished right under Article 21 of the Constitution to participate in public life.""Balaji said there was not even a whisper of violation of any bail condition meriting interference by the court and the contention of influencing witnesses was specifically argued before and addressed by the SC in its judgment while granting him bail. He said he had been appearing before the trial court on every date after his release on regular bail and there was no ground whatsoever to suggest that he was either delaying the ED trial or attempting to influence any witnesses.","V Senthil Balaji was reappointed as minister in the M K Stalin govt after being released on bail.
