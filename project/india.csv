Madras HC calls for revamp of medical edu curriculum to tackle 'LGBTQIA+ phobia',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/madras-hc-calls-for-revamp-of-medical-edu-curriculum-to-tackle-lgbtqia-phobia/articleshow/117900515.cms,"CHENNAI: Sexual orientations and gender identities of persons who are part of the LGBTQIA+ community are natural; it is not a disorder, the Madras high court (HC) asserted on Monday. While questioning the usage of the term ' gender identity disorder ', HC called for a reform in medical education curriculum .""Somehow, the impression is given that LGBTQIA+ identities are a disorder. Why should we use the term 'gender identity disorder'? It shows the mindset,"" Justice N Anand Venkatesh said, adding, nature decided to create someone this way.The court made the observations on a 2021 plea moved by a lesbian couple seeking protection from police torture and opposition from their parents. The judge expanded the scope of the plea to revamp the curriculum in medical colleges to tackle 'LGBTQIA+ phobia' and recognise their legal rights.Justice Venkatesh censured National Medical Commission for dragging its feet on the court's suggestion to change the curriculum of medical education to do away with outdated notions about the LGBTQIA+ community. The commission is yet to amend its regulations to classify conversion therapy as professional misconduct, as the revised 2023 regulations are yet to be notified, the judge noted.Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu govt informed HC that it was proposing to come up with two policies - one for welfare of transgender and intersex persons, and another for persons who are part of the LGBTQIA+ community.To this, Justice Venkatesh wondered why the state had decided to come up with two different policies, and directed it to report difficulties, if any, in having a unified policy. Court adjourned the hearing to Feb 17.","Madras high court: Sexual orientations and gender identities of persons who are part of the LGBTQIA+ community are natural.

SC to decide validity of new law on CEC & ECs appointment on February 12,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-to-decide-validity-of-new-law-on-cec-ecs-appointment-on-february-12/articleshow/117900416.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Monday refused to entertain a plea for interim stay on the selection of the next chief election commissioner after Rajiv Kumar retires on Feb 18, saying it would rather test the validity of the CEC and other ECs (Appointment, Conditions of Officer and Terms of Office) Act, 2023, and give a finding.For one of the petitioners, advocate Prashant Bhushan requested a bench of Justices Surya Kant and N K Singh to stay the process for the selection of a new CEC on the grounds that the 2023 law breached the SC judgment, which had included the CJI in the selection committee along with the PM and the leader of opposition in Lok Sabha, intending to make the panel independent of the executive.Bhushan said that by substituting the CJI with a Union cabinet minister in the three-member selection committee, the independence of the process has been breached. The absence of independence of the Election Commission, the CEC and the election commissioners (ECs) would pose grave danger to holding free and fair elections , which are vital to democracy.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said similar arguments were raised by the same counsel before a bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Datta, which by a well-reasoned interim order had last year refused to stay the operation of the 2023 law providing the mechanism for selection of the CEC and the ECs.He said SC had provided the composition of the selection panel but had categorically said that the interim arrangement would be operational till Parliament enacted a law, which it did in Dec 2023.The bench said instead of hearing the merits of pleas seeking interim stay on the operation of the 2023 law, it is better to hear the matter fully and decide it. It posted it for further hearing on Feb 12.By Feb 2024, Election Commission was reduced to a one-man commission with CEC Rajiv Kumar. The panel comprising PM Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah and then leader of opposition Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury (who dissented) had appointed IAS officers Gyanesh Kumar and Sukhbir Singh Sandhi as ECs on Mar 16 last year, ahead of the Lok Sabha elections.","Supreme Court refused to entertain a plea for interim stay on the selection of the next chief election commissioner after Rajiv Kumar retires on Feb 18.

"Most pro-middle class Budget in history, says PM Modi",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/most-pro-middle-class-budget-in-history-says-pm-modi/articleshow/117870756.cms,"NEW DELHI: Exuding confidence about BJP 's prospects in Delhi polls, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the Union Budget presented a day earlier ""the most pro-middle class in India's history"", highlighted measures announced by the finance minister and wooed govt employees by pointing to the announcement of the new Pay Commission.""See you at the victory celebrations on Feb 8,"" Modi said, as he addressed a public meeting, his last before the polls, in the middle-class colony of R K Puram on Sunday, claiming that AAP was headed for a defeat. ""Today is Basant Panchami. With Basant Panchami, the weather starts to change. In three days, on Feb 5, a new spring of development is about to arrive in Delhi. AAP-da party of Delhi has ruined the last 11 years here. Now, let's not allow them to ruin the next five years,"" he said.In a hardsell of the middle class-friendly budget, Modi said, ""Earlier, the country's hard-earned money went into scams, and a few people pocketed it. But BJP govt is dedicating this budget for the welfare of citizens. To build a 'Viksit Bharat', I gave guarantees to strengthen four key pillars - farmers, youth, poor and women. This budget ensures that my guarantees are fulfilled.""He made a jibe at AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal who is engaged in an outreach to the middle class . ""Those who live in 'Sheesh Mahal' can't relate to the jhuggis of the poor or the 2BHKs of the middle classs,"" he said.Stating that only BJP respected the middle class, Modi said, ""I want to present a picture to you. If you earned Rs 12 lakh during the time of Nehru, the govt would take back one-fourth of your salary as tax. Under Indira Gandhi's govt, Rs 2 lakh of it would go in taxes. Even 10-12 years ago, under Congress govt, if you earned Rs 12 lakh, you would have to return Rs 2,60,000. But now, under BJP govt, someone earning Rs 12 lakh won't have to pay a single rupee in extra tax.""Modi also made a pitch for govt employees who are an important part of the electorate in the South Delhi constituency. ""After the setting up of the 8th Pay Commission, salaries of govt employees and who help me implement plans for the development and pensions of those who have retired, are going to rise.""Targeting AAP, the PM accused the party of spreading falsehoods. ""No jhuggis will be demolished in Delhi and no welfare schemes will be shut if BJP comes to office,"" he said, as the crowd erupted in cheers. The air was filled with chants of 'Modi hai toh mumkin hai' and 'Bharat Mata ki jai'.Calling Kejriwal's party AAP-da (disaster) once again, the PM said, ""Even before voting in Delhi, the jhaadu (AAP symbol) is falling apart as AAP-da leaders are abandoning it, realising the growing discontent among the people.""""People from AAP-da even indulge in scams with your treatment and medicine... they loot you. I promise, those who looted Delhi will have to return what they've taken. AAP has given Delhi diseases - pollution is causing harm, respiratory diseases are on the rise, and look at the state of the Yamuna. There is no section of society that hasn't been negatively impacted. The BJP govt will bring an end to all of this. This is Modi's guarantee,"" he added.In the middle of the address, the PM paused twice to admire sketches made by children in the crowd. The kids were holding up their artwork for him, prompting him to ask them their names and addresses so he could write to them.Reaching out to people from Poorvanchal, the PM said, ""Poorvanchalis made me an MP, they also made me the PM. But AAP and Congress have a problem with them. They work in Delhi and contribute to its development.
