My protocol does not come in my way. I go directly to the people, listen and talk to them... I believe that the farmers have the first right to our government's treasury. We gave Rs. 15000 crores in 2 years to compensate for the losses... The Opposition asks if this is the work of the CM, to go on the road. I ask if it is the CM's job to sit at home, is his job only to go live on Facebook. We are people who work face-to-face. Ours is not a deaf and dumb government. I am proud that within a short time, people have started saying that this is their government. My Ladli Yojana has become a super hit, is that wrong? People's money should be spent to save people's lives. Wherever I am, in the ministry, at home, in the car, in a programme, anywhere, if a slip of CM Relief Fund comes, I immediately sign it. One lakh lives have been saved, this is a matter of great fortune for me,"" he said.The Shiv Sena leader also played down reports of him being projected as the CM candidate by the Mahayuti alliance.""Work, development of the state, lifestyle change, our government has done all of this. In the Lok Sabha elections, the vote share moved towards the Shiv Sena. The same will be repeated in these elections also. I am the team leader as of now. Our team is working. Everyone in our team is equal. Our goal is to bring the Mahayuti government and develop the state.""While the BJP has been keen on not fielding a candidate against Raj Thackeray's son in Mahim, Eknath Shinde remained non-committal. Shinde has put up strongman Sadav Sarvankar on the seat.""He (Raj Thackeray) was with us in the Lok Sabha elections. I had a conversation with him as to what is his strategy, and he said to let Shiv Sena, BJP and NCP decide first. But they directly fielded their candidates. We also have an MLA there. I talked to him. The workers should also be looked after while contesting elections. We should not let the morale of the workers down. Certainly, today we have an alliance of Shiv Sena, BJP and NCP Ajit Pawar. We are contesting the elections under the same alliance, we have RPI's Athavale and Jan Suraaj... We will contest the elections and will win with a majority,"" he said.Eknath Shinde also tore into Congress after its Chief Mallikarjun Kharge had warned the party of not promising freebies beyond the state budget.""He (Kharge) is correct because they do not have the intention to give. They dont know how to give, they know how to take. If PM Modi sends one rupee then the entire rupee goes into the DBT (Direct Bank Transfer). They have not learnt to give. We followed the guidelines of the RBI and the Central Government. We can take a loan of 25% of the GDP. Our loan is 17.5% and we are within the 3% of FRBM (Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act). We follow every guideline, we have not violated anything, therefore we have kept the entire year's budget for it, therefore this scheme will not be stopped. No one will stop the Ladli Behen Yojana ,"" he said.The Ladli Behen Yojna has been one of the strongest campaign points for the Yuti alliance and Shinde is confident that it will yeild results for the Yuti in the elections.""All of this was unexpected for the Opposition, they think we're just puppets. They did not know that we would run such a big scheme and take development forward. The industry is also trusting us. Our government works for the people and the previous government used to work for itself, to build its property, for its own benefit. Some of their leaders used to say, khata khat, khata khat, not even a single rupee was given. Our government put the money in people's accounts, pat pata, pat. The money for the Ladli Behen scheme should not be stopped because of the Model Code of Conduct, that is why we gave the November money in October. Elections are on November 20, results are on 23. After that, we will give the money for December in November. I belong to a poor farmer family. I have seen poverty. I used to think that whenever I would get the power, I would do something for my beloved sisters, mothers, farmers, brothers and senior citizens... As soon as I got the power, I told both my deputy CMs what we had to do and we did. The Opposition has not been able to digest this. They are going to lose, they have started defaming it,"" Shinde said.The Maharashtra assembly elections are scheduled for November 20 with the results for Maharashtra and Jharkhand to be declared on November 23.",Eknath Shinde says that he believes in going directly to the people and listening to them.

"Congress slams Election Commission for ‘lack of neutrality’, panel hits back",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-slams-ec-for-lack-of-neutrality-panel-hits-back/articleshow/114867915.cms,"NEW DELHI: Accusing the Election Commission (EC) of replying to its complaints pertaining to 20 seats in recent Haryana polls with attacks on Congress netas and the party, and of adopting a “condescending” tone, Congress said, “If the current EC’s goal is to strip itself of the last vestiges of neutrality, then it is doing a remarkable job at creating that impression”.EC responded by saying Congress’s statement seemed more like criticism directed at the commission than a counter to core issues clarified by EC in its letter to Mallikarjun Kharge on October 29.The letter to EC, written by senior Congress functionaries K C Venugopal, Ashok Gehlot, Ajay Maken, Abhishek Singhvi, Jairam Ramesh and Pawan Khera, says, “Judges who write decisions don’t attack or demonise a party raising issues. However, if the EC persists, we shall have no choice but to seek legal recourse to expunge such remarks.”Election Commission is familiar with this remedy since it unsuccessfully sought to do the same with a high court’s unflattering but accurate observations after Covid.Congress sent a scathing reply to EC after the watchdog dismissed its complaints pertaining to 20 constituencies in Haryana elections as designed to bring the entire results under a cloud.Congress’s letter said the party had raised specific issues in Haryana but the “EC response is generic and focused on diminishing the complaints and the petitioners”. It said that the “EC has given a clean chit to itself... the answer given to the question of the machines’ fluctuating batteries seeks to confuse rather than clarify”.The Congress letter took exception to EC calling its engagement with the party as “exceptional”, arguing the constitutional watchdog with quasi-judicial functions was only doing its duty by hearing a political party — adding that “the commission seems to have forgotten” the fact.“We do not know who is advising or guiding the commission,” the letter said, adding that the party can take legal recourse if EC refuses to engage with it over its complaints.In fact, Congress slammed as “disingenuous” EC’s bid to identify a pattern in its complaints, arguing that most of its petitions pertain to the short duration of elections where causes of action arise quickly.It said EC has not taken action in any of the over 100 complaints against PM Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah, while acting against Congress’ Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi for their speeches.Reacting to the letter, an EC official told TOI, “EC had made three points. First, that the allegations relating to EVM battery and electoral processes in Haryana were unfounded and baseless, with Congress candidates or their agents being involved at every stage. Second, EC had pointed to a ‘pattern’ in raising of unfounded doubts by Congress on ‘core’ aspects of the electoral process over past 5-6 elections, on which too the party has maintained silence.“Third, EC had said raising unfounded doubts on electoral processes during polling or counting, while the anxiety of the public and political parties is already at its peak, leads to public unrest and turbulence... this point also appears to have been accepted by Congress,” the official added.Another official further said, “Congress seems to be in a dilemma after its allegations of irregularities in Haryana were rejected by EC. It had the option to file an election petition in the high court, since the result was already declared. But Congress chose to petition EC despite being aware of the rules.”Congress can still challenge the result as an election petition can be filed within 45 days from the result.",Congress sent a scathing reply to EC after the watchdog dismissed its complaints pertaining to 20 constituencies in Haryana elections. EC responded by saying Congress’s statement seemed more like criticism directed at the commission than a counter to core issues clarified by EC.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114867978,imgsize-95864,width-400,resizemode-4/114867978.jpg"

Congress badly exposed due to unreal promises: PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-badly-exposed-due-to-unreal-promises-pm-modi/articleshow/114865312.cms,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi

NEW DELHI: :Latching on to recent remarks of Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge on poll sops, PM Modi on Friday claimed the opposition party “is realising the hard way that making unreal promises is easy but implementing them properly is tough or impossible”. Modi cautioned people to be “vigilant” against Congress’s “culture of fake promises”.“Campaign after campaign they (Congress) promise things to people, which they also know they will never be able to deliver. Now, they stand badly exposed in front of people,” Modi said in a series of posts on X with the hashtag #FakePromisesOfCongress. Kharge, remarking on Karnataka deputy CM D K Shivakumar’s statement acknowledging problems in carrying on with a scheme, had emphasised the need to take into account fiscal constraints while making promises.K harge urged careful consideration and warned that an unplanned approach could lead to financial difficulties and negatively impact future generations. Underscoring the importance of fiscal responsibility, he said that if the central govt failed to deliver on its commitments, it could result in a bad reputation and hardship for the community. BJP , which has been critical of Congress and other rivals for making “irresponsible promises”, treated the remark as a validation of its charge. “Check any state where Congress has govts today — Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka and Telangana — the developmental trajectory and fiscal health is turning from bad to worse,” PM Modi said as he expanded the attack on Rahul Gandhi’s “khata khat” promises.“Their so-called guarantees lie unfulfilled, which is a terrible deceit upon people of these states. The victims of such politics are the poor, youngsters, farmers and women, who are not only denied the benefits of these promises but also see their existing schemes diluted,” Modi further said, his remarks set to further inflame the political rivalry during the campaign for Maharashtra and Jharkhand polls.Kharge responded to Modi by alleging that the PM was guilty of not keeping scores of his promises. Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah also stepped in to assert that his govt was committed to implement the five guarantees. However, his intervention fed into the perception of the widening divergence between him and his deputy, with Modi suggesting that people and the state are suffering because of the relentless feuding between Congress functionaries.Making a veiled reference to the schism in Karnataka Congress, Modi said the party is busy in intraparty politics and loot instead of delivering on development. “Not only that, they are also going to roll back existing schemes,” he added.PM Modi said even in Himachal Pradesh, salaries of govt employees were not paid on time; in Telangana, farmers were waiting for the promised waiver. The PM said people will have to be vigilant against Congress’s culture of fake promises .“We saw recently how people of Haryana rejected their lies and preferred a govt that is stable, progress-oriented and action driven. There is a growing realisation across India that a vote for Congress is a vote for non-governance, poor economics and unparalleled loot. People of India want development and progress, not the same old,” he added.Earlier, BJP’s Ravi Shankar Prasad mockingly asked if Kharge had given his first “gyan” to Rahul, noting the former Congress president often boasted of “khata khat” (immediate) transfer of money to different population segments during elections in case his party came to office.","PM Modi warns people to be “vigilant’ against Congress’s “culture of fake promises” “Campaign after campaign they (Congress) promise things to people, which they also know they will never be able to deliver.

KOLKATA: A murder convict who spent seven years in jail was acquitted last month by Calcutta HC , which, after going through evidence, found serious lacunae in establishing beyond doubt that he had committed the crime.The incident dates to April 23, 2015, when Kolkata resident Ranadip Banerjee , alias Rinku, was accused of murdering his elder brother, who suffered from a neurological disorder. A cousin of the two brothers, Joydeep Banerjee, had registered a case with Gariahat police station. In 2017, Ranadip was convicted of murder by a trial court under IPC Section 302 .Ranadip challenged his conviction before a division bench of Justice Soumen Sen and Justice Uday Kumar citing discrepancies and inconsistencies in evidence. ""Chain of circumstances has been fabricated by police as per their whim and fancy in absence of any evidence to commission of offence whatsoever,"" his counsel stated.The state's counsel contended that it had been established that the relationship between the brothers was bitter and the accused used to assault the victim. On the day of murder he caused injury to the victim and prevented him from receiving proper treatment, leading to his death.However, after going through the case details, HC bench observed that while courts can ignore trivial inconsistencies, material contradictions are fatal and demolish a case that is based on circumstantial evidence due to failure to establish links.The bench expressed surprise at the investigating officer not recording statements of immediate neighbours and tenants on the premises in which the crime was committed. It pointed out that while the prosecution had claimed that a blood-stained rod recovered from the room was the murder weapon, no forensic examination was conducted to ascertain if the blood on it matched that of the victim or whether the accused's fingerprints were present on it","Ranadip Banerjee was accused of murdering his elder brother, who suffered from a neurological disorder.

The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections , which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases. The results will be declared on November 23, along with Maharashtra.In the Tribal-dominated state, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and CM Hemant's Soren Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) are in a direct fight, while the Congress party and Lalu Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) are in alliance with the JMM.The JMM-Congress-RJD alliance are also reportedly seeking to deal with Left parties, Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party and other tribal outfits that have been contesting the elections in the state as independent entities and make efforts to field candidates against the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) on all 81 seats collectively.In the last assembly polls in 2019, the JMM-Congress-RJD alliance won a comfortable majority of 47 seats in a House of 81.The BJP slipped to 25 seats from 37 it held in 2014. The poor performance was perceived to be the outcome of its decision to contest alone backfiring. The party did not foster an alliance with the Ajsu in the 2019 polls when Raghubar Das, currently the Odisha governor, was serving the state as CM.In this year's Lok Sabha polls in Jharkhand, the BJP-led NDA secured nine out of the 14 seats, with the BJP winning eight and its alliance partner, the Ajsu (All Jharkhand Students Union) Party, retaining its single seat.On the other hand, the opposition India bloc improved its tally, increasing its seat count from two in 2019 to five in the parliamentary polls.BJP and JMM have spruced up their pace of campaigning from the ground zero to social media. BJP and JMM leaders are actively rebutting and challenging each other on a range of issues, including illegal immigration, youth welfare, employment and housing.INDIA bloc parties in Jharkhand slammed the EC for holding assembly elections in the state along with that of Maharashtra but claimed that they were ready to slug it out with BJP-led NDA, which has welcomed the announcement of poll dates.JMM, Congress, and CPI (ML-L) said the announcement showed that EC was in a hurry to conduct elections though the assembly tenure was due to end in January next year.Also, both the INDIA bloc and BJP-led NDA are expected to get into huddles to discuss the modalities of seat-sharing which is going to be a challenge for both the competing teams.","The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections, which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra. Elections in Maharashtra will be held in single phase on November 20. The counting of votes will be on November 23.Maharashtra is gearing up for elections as the two major political alliances—the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) and the Mahayuti—prepare to face each other for the first time in a Vidhan Sabha election.The Maha Vikas Aghadi, comprise of the Congress, the Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray), and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) under Sharad Pawar, will go head-to-head with the Mahayuti , which includes the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Shiv Sena faction led by Eknath Shinde, and the NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar. This will be the first electoral contest between these two alliances since the splits within the Shiv Sena and NCP.The MVA is hopeful of replicating its recent Lok Sabha success, while the Mahayuti aims to retain power by leveraging its populist schemes targeted at women and youth. Both alliances have set their sights on winning the state.Narayan Rane, a former Union Minister and the victor in the Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg Lok Sabha constituency, is poised to be a key figure for the BJP in the Konkan region during the forthcoming elections. Meanwhile, two constituencies are expected to be critical battlegrounds: chief minister Eknath Shinde's Kopri-Pachpakdi seat in Thane City and Worli in Mumbai, where Aaditya Thackeray, a leader of the Shiv Sena (UBT), is seeking reelection.In the last Vidhan Sabha elections in 2019, the BJP secured 26.1% of the votes, the Congress 16.1%, the NCP 16.9%, and the Shiv Sena 16.6%. The BJP and the Shiv Sena (then united) formed the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which secured a majority. However, the coalition soon crumbled due to disagreements over government formation, plunging the state into a political crisis.After no party could establish a government, Maharashtra was placed under President's rule. Devendra Fadnavis was briefly sworn in as chief minister, with Ajit Pawar as deputy chief minister. However, both resigned just days later before a scheduled floor test.By November 28, 2019, a new coalition emerged, with the Shiv Sena (Uddhav faction), NCP (Sharad Pawar faction), and Congress forming the Maha Vikas Aghadi government, led by Uddhav Thackeray as chief minister.The state's politics took another turn in June, 2022, when Uddhav Thackeray resigned following a rebellion within the Shiv Sena, led by Eknath Shinde, who then allied with the BJP. Eknath Shinde assumed the role of chief minister, with Devendra Fadnavis returning as deputy chief minister.",The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra. Elections in Maharashtra will be held in single phase on November 20. The counting of votes will be on November 23.
