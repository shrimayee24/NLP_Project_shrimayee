Congress brass forced to step in as Karnataka faction feud intensifies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/congress-brass-forced-to-step-in-as-karnataka-faction-feud-intensifies/articleshow/111387398.cms,"BENGALURU: A potential cabinet reshuffle and a gag order are among measures Congress has adopted to address a factional feud within its Karnataka unit, which has pitted supporters of chief minister (CM) Siddaramaiah against those of his deputy DK Shivakumar.Congress high command has intervened, issuing a stern warning to maintain discipline as the feud is negatively impacting the state's administration and damaging the party's image, sources said on Sunday.This comes amid demands from several party functionaries to replace Siddaramaiah with Shivakumar as CM, and to appoint more deputy CMs.Although Siddaramaiah denied it, sources said he has been asked to reshuffle his cabinet to include senior legislators who were initially denied ministerial positions. The CM faces pressure from several legislators, led by seniors Vinay Kulkarni and P M Narendra Swamy, to overhaul his council of ministers. Around 40 MLAs are waiting to replace non-performing ministers.On Sunday, Shivakumar met Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge in Delhi, while Siddaramaiah met party MP Rahul Gandhi the day before.""Kharge, Siddaramaiah, and I have arrived at a decision on how to work in interest of the party,"" Shivakumar said. ""There is no need for any minister, MLA, or any individual to talk about it in public. If any functionary continues to talk to the media about the CM or deputy CM posts, then it would be inevitable for both AICC and KPCC to take disciplinary action.""Both Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar issued strict instructions to their supporters to refrain from making public statements on the CM and deputy CM issues. The central brass has also decided to send veteran Madhusudan Mistry to review Congress' performance in Karnataka in Lok Sabha polls and gather legislators' opinions on the leadership dispute.The state unit is planning to send a fact-finding team to all 28 parliamentary constituencies. ""The objective is to hear from all quarters about prevailing issues and restore discipline to prepare the party to face a series of polls ahead,"" said KPCC working president GC Chandrashekhar.Shivakumar's opponents have called for his replacement as Congress state president, citing the party's ""one man, one position"" principle. Shivakumar currently serves both as deputy CM and state party president.However, Shivakumar's brother and former MP DK Suresh dismissed these demands, suggesting that those calling for his resignation should either ""put up or shut up"". Suresh referred to former chief minister Ramakrishna Hegde, who dissolved govt and called for early elections after a poor performance in LS polls, challenging those seeking positions to lead the party to victory before claiming privileges.","Congress high command has intervened, issuing a stern warning to maintain discipline.

BJP's counterattack plan

What INDIA bloc is demanding



NEW DELHI: The second week of the first session of the 18th Lok Sabha, which is set to begin from Monday, is likely to witness heated debates and fiery exchanges between the BJP-led NDA government and opposition bloc INDIA on issues ranging from the NEET-NET paper leaks row to Agnipath scheme, inflation, and unemployment .The opposition, led by the Congress, is pressing for a dedicated discussion on the paper leaks controversy, but the government seems to want to focus the debate on the Motion of Thanks on the President's address first.While in the Lok Sabha, education minister Dharmendra Pradhan has accused the Congress of wanting to ""run away"" from a discussion on NEET and asserted the government is ready for any type of discussion; Vice President and Rajya Sabha chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar has said he was ""constrained"" to not accept the opposition's notices for a discussion under Rule 267 on NEET, as the President's address debate was the priority.The BJP will be initiating the debate on the Motion of Thanks on the President's address in both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, with Anurag Thakur and Sudhanshu Trivedi as the first speakers respectively. In Lok Sabha, the motion will be seconded by first-time MP Bansuri Swaraj, daughter of late BJP leader Sushma Swaraj.The Lok Sabha has allocated 16 hours for the debate on the Motion of Thanks, which will conclude with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's reply on Tuesday. In the Rajya Sabha, 21 hours have been allotted for the debate, with the PM likely to reply on Wednesday.This allows the NDA to set the agenda in Parliament initially in the week.Several media reports citing sources have also suggested that the BJP has compiled an action-taken list against those responsible for NEET anomalies and the government's commitment to CBI investigation of the matter.Many reports also indicate that the BJP plans to ""expose the Opposition"" on issues like corruption and the recent hooch tragedy in Tamil Nadu to counter the NEET allegations. It is expected that the BJP-led NDA will target the DMK government over the Tamil Nadu hooch tragedy and the TMC over post-poll violence in West Bengal, to hold the opposition accountable for their ""selective outrage"".The opposition INDIA bloc has been vocal in its demand for a discussion on the NEET paper leak issue, with Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi and Rajya Sabha LoP Mallikarjun Kharge leading the charge.However, the government has so far refused to provide a separate discussion on this, asking the opposition to raise it during the debate on the Motion of Thanks.The Congress has tried to put pressure on the government by holding nationwide protests demanding justice for students affected by the NEET irregularities. It has also demanded a Supreme Court-monitored investigation into the alleged malpractices, paper leaks, inflated marks, and other irregularities in the NEET-UG 2024 exam.The INDIA bloc has also calling for the removal of the National Testing Agency (NTA) chairman, who the Congress alleges is responsible for the NEET irregularities.The opposition is also likely to corner the government on rising prices and the state of the economy.","The second week of the first session of the 18th Lok Sabha, which is set to begin from Monday, is likely to witness heated debates and fiery exchanges.

Congress demands law to tweak Constitution for quota beyond 50% cap,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-demands-law-to-tweak-constitution-for-quota-beyond-50-cap/articleshow/111387346.cms,"NEW DELHI: Congress has demanded that Parliament pass a law to amend the Constitution to enable reservation for Scheduled Castes , Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes to exceed the Supreme Court mandated 50% cap. The party urged that the bill be brought in the next session of Parliament and asked PM Narendra Modi to clear his stand on the issue.The demand came a day after NDA constituent JD(U) passed a resolution at its national executive meeting urging the Centre to put Bihar's law pertaining to reservations under the Constitution's Ninth Schedule to rule out judicial review of the quota increase beyond 50% in the state.In a post on X on Sunday, Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh questioned the silence of BJP, JD(U)'s ally in the state and at the Centre. He said putting reservation laws beyond the 50% cap in the Ninth Schedule was not a solution, because according to a 2007 SC decision, such laws were also subject to judicial review.Ramesh said the current limit of 50% was not explicitly mandated by the Constitution, but was decided through various SC decisions. He went on to say that in such a situation, a bill to amend the Constitution was the only way out and this was something the Congress had promised in its manifesto for the Lok Sabha polls and remained committed to.Ramesh asked whether the PM would ""clear his stand""? ""Our demand is that such a bill should be introduced in the next session . JD(U) should not be limited to just passing resolutions,"" he added.","JD(U) passed a resolution at its national executive meeting urging the Centre to put Bihar's law pertaining to reservations under the Constitution's Ninth Schedule.

Venkaiah's life showcases public service commitment: PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/venkaiahs-life-showcases-public-service-commitment-pm-modi/articleshow/111387336.cms,"Today, India's former Vice President and respected statesman M Venkaiah Naidu Garu turns 75. I wish him a long and healthy life and also extend my greetings to all his well-wishers. This is an occasion to celebrate a leader whose life journey showcases dedication, adaptability and an unwavering commitment to public service . From his early days in the political arena to his tenure as Vice President, Venkaiah Garu 's career exemplifies his unique ability to navigate the complexities of Indian politics with ease and humility.His eloquence, wit and steadfast focus on developmental issues have earned him respect across party lines.Venkaiah Garu and I have been associated with each other for decades and I have learnt a lot from him. He loves people. He started as a student activist and preferred to work with the Sangh Parivar because he was inspired by its ideology of 'Nation First'. After stints with RSS and ABVP, he joined and strengthened Jana Sangh and BJP He joined the resistance against the Emergency imposed in 1975 and was jailed for inviting Loknayak JP to Andhra Pradesh . His commitment to democracy led him to join the movement against the dismissal of the N T Rama Rao govt by Congress in the mid-1980s.Venkaiah Garu has always been comfortable swimming even against the most formidable tides. In 1978, Andhra Pradesh voted for Congress but he beat the trend and was elected as a young MLA. Five years later, he defied the NTR wave to get re-elected as a BJP MLA, thus paving the way for BJP's growth across the state.All vouch for Venkaiah Garu's oratory skills. He is certainly a wordsmith but he is as much a worksmith. As a young MLA, he distinguished himself as a people's representative and a lawmaker. No less than a stalwart like NTR noted his talent and even wanted him to join his party but Venkaiah Garu refused to give up his core ideology. He went on to play a big role in strengthening BJP in AP. He led the party in the assembly and even became the state BJP chief.Recognising his effort, the BJP leadership appointed him the party's national general secretary, a remarkable achievement for a grassroots worker. He soon rose to become the party president.In 2000, when Atal ji was keen to induct him in the govt, Venkaiah Garu surprised all by expressing his preference for the ministry of rural development. However, being the son of a farmer who spent his early years in villages, Venkaiah Garu was clear about the choice and was involved in the conception and implementation of 'Pradhan Mantri Gramin Sadak Yojana. When the NDA govt was formed in 2014, he handled the crucial portfolios of urban development, housing and urban poverty alleviation. It was during his tenure that we launched the important Swachh Bharat Mission.When I came to Delhi in 2014, I was an outsider and benefited from Venkaiah Garu's insights. He was an effective parliamentary affairs minister - he knew the essence of bipartisanship but at the same time he drew a line when it came to norms and rules.Nominating him as NDA's vice presidential candidate in 2017 involved a dilemma. Finding his replacement in the govt was tough but at the same time, there was no better candidate for the vice presidency than him. I can never forget the speech he gave when he resigned as minister and MP, recalling his association with the party. It showed his commitment.Upon becoming Vice President, he undertook various steps that also enhanced the dignity of the office. He was an outstanding chairman of Rajya Sabha.When the decision to remove Articles 370 and 35(A) were placed on the floor of Rajya Sabha, Venkaiah Garu was in the chair. It must have been an emotional moment for him, the young boy who was drawn to Syama Prasad Mookerjee's dream of a united India was in the chair when this was finally achieved.Venkaiah Garu is a voracious reader and writer too. In Delhi, he is also known as the person who brought the glorious Telugu culture to the city. His Ugadi and Sankranti programmes are clearly among the most cherished gatherings in town. He loves food and also hosting people.Even now, Venkaiah Garu has an active public life and calls me on issues he is passionate about as well as important developments.I wish him once again on this milestone. I hope all those who have a passion for public service learn from his life and imbibe those values. It is people like him who make our nation better and more vibrant.(The author is the Prime Minister of India)",Venkaiah Garu's career exemplifies his unique ability to navigate the complexities of Indian politics with ease and humility.
