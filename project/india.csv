Maharashtra government formation: Signal to Shinde? BJP says Maharashtra government oath on December 5,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maharashtra-government-formation-signal-to-shinde-bjp-says-maharashtra-government-oath-on-december-5/articleshow/115854029.cms,"CM will be from BJP, deputies from

& Sena, says Ajit

NEW DELHI: BJP on Saturday announced that the new Mahayuti govt will be sworn in on Dec 5 in what is being seen as a signal to Eknath Shinde to make up his mind fast about joining the govt led by Devendra Fadnavis.State BJP chief Chandrashekhar Bawankule said in a post on X that the swearing-in ceremony will take place at Azad Maidan and PM Modi would attend it. ""The wait for this historic swearing-in is over. We thank the public for their support,"" Bawankule said.The announcement came after talks had paused after the three Mahayuti netas, caretaker CM Eknath Shinde, Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar met home minister Amit Shah in Delhi. The unambiguous post on X and the timing of it came as a surprise because there has been no communication between Shinde and BJP since he left Delhi and headed to his village in Satara district, after which he has been reportedly unwell.Political circles in Delhi and Mumbai were unanimous that the post was a clear message to Shinde to come around and agree to be part of the Fadnavis govt.During deliberations, Shinde had raised the issue of the awkwardness of him joining govt as deputy CM after having served as CM of Mahayuti govt. Sources said Shah is learned to have told him calmly that even Fadnavis, an ex-CM, had joined him as deputy and it was not a decision Fadnavis took on his own but because he was asked to do so by the party.BJP's confidence is based on the numbers it has in the assembly: 132 plus five independents, which with Ajit's support swells to a daunting 178, putting the ball in Shinde's court.NCP chief Ajit Pawar on Saturday reiterated the CM would be from BJP and there would be two deputy chief ministers, one from NCP and the other from Shiv Sena However, Sena would, in addition to seeking the deputy CM's post, keep up its demand for the home portfolio and for retaining all the nine ministries it held in the Shinde-led govt, a Sena functionary said. These include the industries and urban development departments.Asked about Sena's demand for the home portfolio, Ajit Pawar said, ""It's the CM's prerogative to decide portfolios. There is no tug-of-war regarding portfolios.""Shiv Sena's Sanjay Shirsat justified the party's demand. ""When BJP held the deputy CM's post, they got the home portfolio. So it's only fair that we insist on it. If there is a dashing leader in charge of the home department, it will keep rioters at bay,"" he said.The Sena functionary said there are no backchannel talks or negotiations going on with BJP and any formula will only be discussed when Shinde, Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar meet in person.""Before the meeting with Union home minister Amit Shah in New Delhi, CM Shinde had made it clear he was wholeheartedly accepting of their decision on the next CM. In the Delhi meeting, no name for CM was announced. It was only indicated that the CM will be from BJP. It was decided that the exact formula will be decided by CM Shinde, Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar in Mumbai and then reported to New Delhi. After CM Shinde's return from Delhi there has been no communication with BJP or NCP, and BJP hasn't elected its own legislature party leader,"" the Sena functionary said.In the outgoing govt, CM Shinde headed urban development department. Gulabrao Patil helmed water supply and sanitation, Dada Bhuse led ports and mining, Uday Samant was industries minister and Tanaji Sawant had public health and family welfare portfolio, among others.The Sena functionary said, ""Our ministers got only 2.5 years in this govt so they need more time to perform. Sena is clear on this. Whether CM Shinde is the DCM or he nominates someone else is his decision.""Meanwhile, Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray said, ""Before the MVA govt was formed, they declared President's rule. Now after such a massive majority, the Mahayuti govt has still not been formed. The term of the assembly is over. Why hasn't President's rule been declared?"" Thackeray took a dig at Shinde's trip to his village in Satara on Friday. ""After such a massive majority, some people are going to their fields instead of Raj Bhavan,"" he said.Shiv Sena (UBT)'s Sanjay Raut said, ""Shinde looks uneasy, both mentally and physically. The smile on his face and twinkle in his eyes is gone. It's like he was offered something which has been taken away,"" Raut said.Shiv Sena's Shirsat hit back at Raut, saying, ""After this verdict, it's clear to us whose mental balance has been affected.""","BJP chief Chandrashekhar Bawankule says swearing-in ceremony will take place at Azad Maidan.

However, the leaders have not placed any name in the public even a week after storming back to power with an unprecedented mandate.On Thursday, Mahayuti's leadership, including caretaker CM and Shiv Sena supremo Eknath Shinde , BJP's Devendra Fadnavis and NCP's Ajit Pawar, huddled at Union home minister Amit Shah's house to expedite the state government formation talks.Before the talks at Shah's house, Eknath Shinde had expressed his complete support for the BJP leadership's choice of the next chief minister, stating he would not obstruct the process.However, his visit to his native village in Satara raised eyebrows as it reportedly delayed the finalisation of the government formation process.Speaking on Shinde's visit, Shirsat said: ""Whenever Eknath Shinde thinks that he needs some time to think he goes to his native village.""""By tomorrow evening, he (Eknath Shinde) will take a big decision.

This is 27 seats more than its tally five years back.The Shiv Sena and NCP also outperformed their rival factions in the opposition bloc. Sena with 57 seats and the NCP with 41 seats decimated the opposition, inflicting on the Congress party its worst-ever defeat in the state.","Mahayuti of BJP, Shiv Sena and the NCP won a landslide in Maharashtra completely decimating the opposition's Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) With 236 seats, the ruling coalition has retained power in the state with a thumping two-thirds majority in the 288-member assembly.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115844816,imgsize-1292924,width-400,resizemode-4/115844816.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Ajit Pawar on Saturday said the next chief minister of Maharashtra will be from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), while two deputy CMs will be from the Shiv Sena and his party.Pawar shared what transpired at Thursday's meeting that took place at Union home minister Amit Shah's house in New Delhi.""During the meeting (Delhi meeting of Mahayuti leader) it was decided that Mahayuti will form the government with CM from BJP and the remaining two parties will have DCMs... This is not the first time there has been a delay... If you remember, in 1999, one month was taken for government formation,"" Ajit Pawar told news agency ANI.On Thursday, a day after Eknath Shinde said he would accept the BJP leadership's decision on who should be the next Maharashtra CM, Mahayuti partners got down to working out details of the government, which is to be formed on December 5 . Amit Shah met three chiefs of the alliance — Eknath Shinde, Devendra Fadnavis & Ajit Pawar — on Thursday.The deliberations at Shah's residence late Thursday night saw outgoing CM Eknath Shinde signing up on the logic that BJP, with 132 MLAs of its own and having lined up another five, was the natural claimant for the CM's office, sources familiar with the negotiations told TOI.While Shinde did not spell out whether he would serve as deputy CM along with NCP's Ajit Pawar, BJP sources remained hopeful of persuading him to be part of a Fadnavis team, with NCP sharing the optimism.However, Shine's visit to his native village in Satara raised eyebrows as it reportedly delayed the finalisation of the government formation process.Speaking on Shinde's visit, Shirsat said: ""Whenever Eknath Shinde thinks that he needs some time to think he goes to his native village.""""By tomorrow evening, he (Eknath Shinde) will take a big decision.

She also responded to BJP accusations, which blamed former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal for the removal of the marshals starting in November 2023.Atishi clarified that Kejriwal had, in fact, opposed the removal, referencing a letter from October 2023, in which the CM instructed that the marshals should remain in service, and called for disciplinary action against officials who had withheld their salaries.She accused the LG of removing the marshals without regard for public safety, a decision she said was politically motivated and harmful to the welfare of the marshals and their families.BJP leaders in the assembly dismissed the AAP’s narrative, insisting that the removal of the marshals was carried out under Kejriwal’s direction, and now the AAP was merely playing politics with the issue of their reinstatement.Gupta sought answers from Atishi saying the AAP government deployed bus marshals and then removed them.BJP MLA Abhay Verma questioned the ruling party’s ability to resolve the issue, asking why the AAP government, in power for nearly a decade, had failed to bring back the marshals.Urban development minister Saurabh Bharadwaj, however, highlighted that the regularization of bus marshals fell under the jurisdiction of the LG, as it involved ""services"" and ""law and order"" matters, areas where the Delhi government has limited authority.","Delhi chief minister Atishi says Aam Aadmi Party would not field a candidate against BJP’s leader of opposition, Vijender Gupta.

The commission also agreed to meet a Congress delegation to hear the party's concerns regarding the polling process, EC sources said.While ruling out any discrepancy in turnout data, EC clarified - just as it had when similar doubts were raised by Congress during the 2024 Lok Sabha elections - that the gap in the 5pm data and the final voter turnout was on account of procedural priorities, as presiding officers perform statutory duties near the close of polling before updating voter turnout data.EC underlined in the letter sent to Congress's law, human rights and RTI department, that the poll panel has, starting with the 2024 general elections, made it a standard practice to put out a press statement with updated voter turnout figures as of 11.45pm on polling day, as an ""additional disclosure measure"".Congress had flagged the twin concerns despite the varied results in Maharashtra and Jharkhand - while the BJP-led Mahayuti alliance won a landslide in Maharashtra, UPA recorded a spectacular win in Jharkhand.Even as EC, in its response, tried to allay the concerns raised by Congress, it agreed to get the issues regarding the addition and deletion of voters examined.

It reiterated that total votes polled at each polling booth were given by the presiding officer, before leaving the polling station, to authorised agents of candidates in Form 17C Part 1, at the end of polling in Maharashtra and Jharkhand.
