While Giri was fielded from Manjhi (Saran), Ritesh was fielded from Kargahar in Rohtas district. The JS has also given a chance to Priti Kinner, a transgender who has been fielded from Bhorey (SC) seat in Gopalganj district.The fledgling party has also taken care of maintaining caste equations while finalising tickets for candidates in the state where caste remains a deciding factor. Of the 51 candidates whose names were announced on Thursday, 17 come from the extremely backward class (EBC), 11 from other backward classes (OBC), nine from general category and seven from the Muslim community.A total of seven seats are reserved for scheduled castes and tribes.
