Cutting close to deadline

NEW DELHI: After weeks of suspense, the Congress on Friday finally declared its candidates for the Amethi and Rae Bareli Lok Sabha constituencies of Uttar Pradesh.Rahul Gandhi has been fielded from Rae Bareli while Kishori Lal Sharma will be contesting from Amethi.The Congress, which is contesting 17 Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh as part of the seat-sharing deal with the Samajwadi Party (SP), had announced candidates for all the seats barring Amethi and Rae Bareli.Rae Bareli is also a bastion of the Congress. From 1967 to 1977, the seat was held by former prime minister Indira Gandhi, and from 2004 until her appointment to the Rajya Sabha in 2024, by Sonia Gandhi .Rahul will file his nomination from the constituency on Friday. He will be pitted against BJP's Dinesh Pratap Singh. He had been fielded by the party from the seat in 2019 too.Singh had lost to Sonia by a margin of 1.67 lakh votes.On being selected again to fight from Rae Bareli, Singh said: ""I assure the country that farewell of 'nakli' Gandhis from Rae Bareli is certain. It is certain that BJP's 'lotus' will bloom, and Congress will lose. I have even fought against 4-time MP Sonia Gandhi, so Priyanka Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi are not important to me. Whichever Gandhi comes to Rae Bareli, they will lose.""The announcement comes on the last day for filing of nominations for Phase 5 of the Lok Sabha elections. Both the constituencies are going to the polls on May 20.Rahul's defeat in Amethi, once considered a Congress 'pocket borough', at the hands of Irani in the 2019 polls was seen as a significant blow to the party's national prestige. Irani won the seat by a margin of around 55,000 votes.Rahul represented Amethi in the Lok Sabha from 2004 to 2019. His father and former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi, too, was an elected member of Amethi in the Lower House from 1981 till his death in 1991. Sonia Gandhi contested elections from here in 1999 before passing the baton on to Rahul in 2004.Rahul currently represents Wayanad in the Lok Sabha while Irani is bidding for a fresh term from Amethi.(With inputs from agencies)",Rahul Gandhi has been fielded from Rae Bareli while Kishori Lal Sharma will be contesting from Amethi.

NEW DELHI/LUCKNOW: BJP has persuaded controversial incumbent in Kaiserganj, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, to yield in favour of his younger son, Karan , while also repeating the candidature of UP minister Dinesh Pratap Singh from the Nehru-Gandhi family stronghold of Rae Bareli .By sidelining Brij Bhushan, the former Wrestling Federation of India chief who has been accused of sexual harassment by woman wrestlers, BJP has sought to neutralise the charge that it was soft on the six-time MP.Although the leadership had made plain its intent by withholding the candidature for the seat, Brij Bhushan did not give up hope and had already started campaigning by taking out roadshows.Apart from winning Kaiserganj thrice in a row (2009, 2014, 2019), Brij Bhushan has won from neighbouring constituencies Gonda (1991 and 1999) and Balrampur (2004). His wife, Ketaki, one of the options considered by BJP, had won from Gonda in 1996 while his son Prateek is an MLA. Brij Bhushan exerts clout through nearly 54 educational institutions he owns or is closely associated with. These institutes dot both sides of a roughly 100km stretch of the Ayodhya-Gonda highway connecting four districts — Gonda, Balrampur, Bahraich and Shravasti.In Rae Bareli, this is the second time that Dinesh Singh, a former Congressman who used to be a confidant of the Gandhis, will be contesting. In 2019, he contested against Sonia Gandhi but lost by over 1.7 lakh votes.The contest has taken a turn with Sonia opting out of LS polls and taking the Rajya Sabha route to Parliament from Rajasthan. BJP, according to sources, is banking on Dinesh Singh’s connect with grassroots functionaries, especially at the village and block level.“I assure the country that the farewell of ‘nakli’ Gandhis from Rae Bareli is certain. It is certain that BJP’s lotus will bloom and Congress will lose. I have fought against four-time MP Sonia Gandhi, so Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Rahul Gandhi are not important to me.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday recounted the challenges he has set for the Congress and said that the party's silence in the matter means ""there is something fishy"".Addressing a public rally in Gujarat's Jamnagar, PM Modi said: ""It has been 9 days since I have challenged the Congress, and they haven't given me a reply on the same...They are quiet, which means something is fishy"".Besides challenging the Congress to categorically state that it will reinstate Article 370 and revoke the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, if it comes to power, PM Modi took the Congress to task over religion-based reservation.""My first challenge is, will the Congress give in writing that they will not change the Constitution and give reservations to Muslims based on religion? Second, will they give it in writing that they will not compromise with the rights of the SC, ST, and OBC by giving away their share of the reservation to Muslims? Will they give in writing that their state governments and their leaders will not run a hidden agenda to give reservations to Muslims?"" said the PM.""When Congress released its manifesto, I alerted the country, especially the intellectuals, that the Congress manifesto is a red alert for the country. I clearly said that I could see the image of the Muslim League in their manifesto, which many thought was a mere political statement ... The narratives that had been imposed during the partition of the country by the Muslim League, unfortunately, similar scenes are being seen today. INDI alliance leaders, in their rallies, are asking Muslim voters to go for vote jihad. And these words came from a very senior Congress leader coming from a very well-educated family,"" he added.""Congress is contesting these elections on two strategies. First, dividing society based on caste. Second, uniting their vote bank through politics of appeasement... Congress is now giving its all to its main motive in these elections. Congress wants to take away reservation from SC, ST, and OBC and give it away to Muslims based on religion, by changing the Constitution,"" said PM Modi.Responding to the challenges, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge reiterated the promises made by the Congress party in its public declaration for Lok Sabha elections 2024.In a letter to PM Modi, Kharge challenged PM Modi and the BJP for a debate on the party's manifesto.""The Congress Party would like to challenge you or anyone you depute to debate with us on our manifesto and the points you have made,"" he wrote.Referring to the letter written by PM Modi to NDA candidates ahead of the third phase of voting, asking them to raise awareness about Congress' 'divisive' agenda, Kharge wrote: ""From the tone and content of the letter it seems that there is a lot of desperation and worry in you which is leading you to use language that does not suit the office of the Prime Minister. The letter makes it look like the lies in your speeches are not having the effect you intended and now you want your candidates to amplify your lies. Repeating a lie a thousand times will not make it the truth"".In his response to PM Modi's accusation that the Congress would divert resources from SC, ST, and OBC communities to its ""votebank,"" Kharge clarified that the ""Vote Bank"" encompasses all Indians, including the disadvantaged, women, youth with aspirations, the working class, Dalits, and Adivasis.""Our votebank is every Indian - the poor, the marginalised, the women, the aspirational youth, the labour class, the Dalits and the Adivasis. Everyone knows it is the RSS and BJP who opposed reservations at every stage since 1947. Everyone knows it is the RSS and BJP which wants to change the Constitution to end reservation. Your leaders have openly spoken about it. You need to clarify why you are opposed to reservation to SC, ST and OBCs on the basis of their population as per Article 16 of our Constitution,"" he stated in the letter.",PM Modi challenged Congress to state that it will reinstate Article 370 and revoke the Citizenship (Amendment) Act if it comes to power. PM Modi also took the Congress to task over religion-based reservation.

"Mama, Maharaja & Raja make MP’s Round-3 battle of bigwigs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mama-maharaja-raja-make-mps-round-3-battle-of-bigwigs/articleshow/109798581.cms,"BHOPAL: The third phase of LS elections is a blockbuster round for Madhya Pradesh. It will decide the political future of three bigwigs — ‘ Maharaja ’ Jyotiraditya Scindia , ‘bacchon ke mama and behno ke bhaiyya’ Shivraj Singh Chouhan and ‘raja’ of Raghogarh Digvijaya Singh aka Diggy Raja. Scindia, the Union aviation minister, returns to Guna to try to reclaim the family seat after his shock loss to former aide K P Yadav in 2019.He had won four times from the seat that has traditionally voted for the Scindias — from ‘Rajmata’ Vijayraje to Madhavrao and Jyotiraditya — and hadn’t expected to be the first to lose it. That, too, by over 1.25 lakh votes. The equations have changed since. Scindia quit Congress in March 2020 and is now the BJP candidate . Yadav, hailed as a hero by BJP in 2019, finds himself sidelined and understandably not very pleased. At a rally in Guna, Union home minister Amit Shah called Scindia “Maharaj” and appealed to voters to “not worry about K P Yadav” as BJP will take care of his future.“You will get two leaders,” he told the voters of Guna. “Jyotiraditya and K P Yadav.” “Jyotiraditya is BJP’s candidate. Among us, if any person is totally dedicated to development, then it is this Maharaj. The Scindia family has nurtured this region more than their children,” Shah said.Despite Shah’s campaign, Guna may not be easy for Scindia. One of the major reasons is the predominant Yadav vote bank which turned its back on him in 2019. Also, the Congress candidate , Rao Yadvendra Singh Yadav, is a former BJP worker with a Jan Sangh legacy. His father, Rao Deshraj Singh Yadav, had established the saffron party in Chambal and challenged Scindia in the 2002 LS bypoll, held after the demise of Madhavrao Scindia in an air crash.In the sympathy wave, Jyotiraditya defeated Deshraj by over 4 lakh votes. Deshraj had also contested unsuccessfully against Madhavrao Scindia in 1999. His son, Yadvendra, recently switched to Congress after over two decades with BJP. He is also a member of Ashokenagar district panchayat. It’s again a family vs family contest with the sides switched.In Rajgarh, it’s Digvijaya’s homecoming after 30 years. He contested this seat thrice and won in 1984 and 1991. He was defeated in 1989 by Jan Sangh leader Pyarelal Khandelwal. In 1991, Singh defeated Khandelwal by just 1,470 votes. After becoming CM in Dec 1993, Digvijaya vacated Rajgarh seat. His brother Lakshman Singh won the bypoll that followed, and four more polls from Rajgarh, the last one on a BJP ticket in 2004. To prove his loyalty to Congress, Digvijaya fielded Narayan Singh Amlave as the party’s candidate against his brother in 2009 and personally campaigned to ensure Congress’ win.Amlave beat Lakshman by 24,388 votes. That was the last time Raghogarh royal family represented the seat. The Modi wave caught up with Rajgarh in 2014 and 2019 when BJP’s Rodmal Nagar, a local businessman close to RSS, won by margins of 2.2 lakh and 4.3 lakh. This is Digvijaya’s turf where the 77-year-old is known as Rajasahab. The Raja returned, albeit wounded, from Bhopal in 2019 when he lost to Malegaon blast accused Pragya Singh Thakur, BJP’s candidate.Diggy Raja is running a determined campaign, addressing public meetings and contacting voters in 25 villages a day. But it is a hard fight. Six of the eight assembly segments of Rajgarh have BJP MLAs. The only two Congressheld ones are Raghogarh, where his son Jaivardhan is the MLA, and Susner where Congress’ Bhairon Singh is the MLA. Jaivardhan won by a margin of 4,505 votes in the Nov 2023 assembly elections and Bhairon by 12,645 votes.Compared to Maharaja and Raja, former chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan is sitting pretty in Vidisha — an impregnable BJP fortress last won by Congress in 1984. Before becoming CM, Chouhan represented Vidisha five times in LS from 1991 (when Atal Behari Vajpayee vacated it) till 2006. Chouhan returns to his LS seat after 18 years. Congress has fielded Pratap Bhanu Sharma, the last partyman to win Vidisha in 1980 and 1984. Vidisha is where Sushma Swaraj won by over 4 lakh votes in 2009 and 2014. In 2019, a relatively less known Ramakant Bhargava won by over 5 lakh votes.Mama Shivraj — chief minister for 16 years whose popularity hit the peak with Ladli Bahna Yojana — is targeting a victory margin of 8 lakh votes. If he achieves this, Chouhan will again emerge as the most popular political face of Madhya Pradesh despite not being chief minister anymore. At a public meeting in Betul last Wednesday, PM Modi said he was taking Chouhan to Parliament.“On May 7, there is an election in Vidisha where my brother Shivraj ji is the candidate. Shivraj Singh Chouhan and I used to work together in the organisation. When he was chief minister and I was chief minister, we used to work together. He went to Parliament when I used to work as general secretary. And now again I want to take him with me,” the PM said. This, however, means that Chouhan’s era in Madhya Pradesh is over; he will now return to central politics.","The third phase of LS elections is a blockbuster round for Madhya Pradesh.

"Kharge’s Gulbarga gambit: 1 step back, 2 forward?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kharges-gulbarga-gambit-1-step-back-2-forward/articleshow/109797972.cms,"Kharge-Modi Battle

High Stakes

KALABURAGI: PM Narendra Modi ’s decision to kick-start the national campaign from Karnataka ’s Kalaburagi district was a calculated move, aimed at sending a clear message on Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge ’s home turf, which falls under Gulbarga Lok Sabha seat.At that time, none of the parties had released their list of candidates and speculation was rife that Kharge, who had suffered his first and only electoral defeat since 1972 in the last Lok Sabha elections, would refrain from contesting again.Kharge, 81, a Rajya Sabha member, eventually decided to stay off the ballot, marking a significant departure from his decades-long presence on Congress’s candidate lists for assembly and parliamentary elections from Gulbarga.Kharge not being in fray is being viewed as a significant development, affecting optics not just for Congress but also for the coalition of opposition parties — INDIA — that he was instrumental in stitching together. Some INDIA members had even pitched Kharge as a potential prime ministerial candidate to take on Modi. Some local Congress insiders feel Kharge not contesting in the backdrop of PM Modi challenging him and ensuring BJP won in Gulbarga in 2019 could further impact the party’s image in the region.But Karnataka minister and Kharge ’s son, Priyank, said, “His decision to not contest is strategic to consolidate and focus on other winnable seats for Congress, given his stature as a national leader whose influence transcends the confines of a single constituency.”Kharge, who has fielded his son-in-law, Radhakrishna, reiterated that he is at the forefront in Gulbarga and expressed confidence in INDIA coalition’s prospects nationally. “...These are, more than ever, people’s elections – people of India versus 10 years of antipeople policies of BJP, whose campaign will evaporate just like in 2004,” Kharge had told TOI a few weeks ago.“There’s no doubt about victory,” Radhakrishna says, as he battles BJP attacks and soaring temperatures – it was 45°C on April 30, when TOI visited. Priyank, a key figure in Congress’s campaign, says: “Things have improved with every passing day of our campaign. BJP cannot repeat its 2019 performance. Some communities, especially the Kolis and Kurubas, have now realised why they should vote for Congress.”The possibility of Kharge becoming PM in case of a fractured verdict has been speculated upon after his elevation as the chairman of INDIA coalition. Congress is even nursing ambitions of a post-poll alliance like in 2004. However, BJP has termed such anticipation “farfetched”, confident of returning to the treasury benches of Lok Sabha with greater numbers. Parliament has witnessed engrossing battles of wits and words between Kharge and Modi.On Feb 5, Modi told Parliament: “...Even Kharge ji is saying ‘this time, it’s Modi govt’. Mr Speaker, I usually don’t get caught up in statistics. But I can see the mood of the nation; it will ensure NDA crosses the 400-mark.”On Feb 7, he said: “I couldn’t say it that day, but I express special thanks to Kharge ji... I was listening very attentively to Kharge ji, and I was thrilled... One thing was very pleasing. I respectfully accept the blessing that he gave to NDA for 400 seats.”Kharge, too, has been taking on Modi on a variety of topics, ranging from economic policies and social issues to matters of national security and governance. Modi has been clear with his messaging, launching his first election campaign from Kharge’s Kalaburagi (Gulbarga seat), rather than his own seat (Varanasi) or perceived Congress strongholds, signalling the significance of the region and the challenge posed by Kharge.Former PM HD Deve Gowda had said, “If Congress wanted to make him the PM, it should have fielded him from Gulbarga... They didn’t make him CM even in 2018 when I had suggested it. Will they ever make him PM?”In Gulbarga, Kharge is engaged in a high-stakes battle to reclaim the seat he lost to BJP’s Umesh Jadhav — a friendturned-foe — in 2019.For Kharge, the defeat was an aberration as he held sway as an unbeatable Congress titan in the region until then. The Congress veteran, who played a crucial role in securing special constitutional status for Kalyana Karnataka region under Article 371(J), seems confident of defeating Jadhav, a Banjara who is seeking votes in PM’s name and Hindutva push.BJP is accusing Kharge of pandering to minority interests, while Congress is selling its secular, inclusive agenda, highlighting BJP’s “failures”. After SCs, Lingayats are the largest community in this reserved seat, with around 5 lakh voters, followed by Muslims and land-owning Kolis — Kabbaligas — having 2.5-3 lakh voters each. Both BJP and Congress are vying for the votes of Lingayats and Kabbaligas. A strong performance by Kharge in Gulbarga could reinvigorate Congress’s prospects in the region and prepare the ground for the next assembly polls’ fight.","Kharge, 81, a Rajya Sabha member, eventually decided to stay off the ballot, marking a significant departure from his decades-long presence on Congress’s candidate lists for assembly and parliamentary elections from Gulbarga. The possibility of Kharge becoming PM in case of a fractured verdict has been speculated upon after his elevation as the chairman of INDIA coalition.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109797880,imgsize-938225,width-400,resizemode-4/109797880.jpg"
Sharad-Ajit shadow Pawarplay in Baramati,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sharad-ajit-shadow-pawarplay-in-baramati/articleshow/109797452.cms,"The Rise Of Pawar, & The Other Pawar

The uncle is the unquestionable king of this realm, his calculations never go wrong, and his political acumen is still relied on, overtly or covertly, for almost every decision in Maharashtra . The nephew, who has been quick on the uptake, has learnt every trick from him but his ambitions are clearly not in line with the clan’s precepts.In the last three decades, countless challengers have attempted to breach the Pawar dynasty’s bastion, yet electoral victory has always favoured the patriarch and NCP founder Sharad Pawar , or his chosen heirs.However, this time, the 83-year-old warhorse is not facing an external adversary but a shrewd insider, his nephew Ajit Pawar who seeks to test the limits of his dominance. Once the senior Pawar’s protegé, Ajit has broken away, taking along the party’s name and its symbol — a clock.Reigning over a fractured fortress — now called NCP (SCP) — Sharad Pawar has anointed his three-time MP daughter, Supriya Sule , to lead the charge from Baramati , which is the family’s citadel. Ajit Pawar, currently one of Maharashtra’s two deputy CMs, has fielded his wife, Sunetra Pawar .On the surface, it is a Supriya vs Sunetra battle, but it symbolises a desperate struggle for legitimacy and supremacy within Baramati’s most powerful family. Supriya has inherited splintered support and unfamiliarity among voters with a new symbol — ‘a man playing tutari’, and faces the formidable NCPBJP-Shiv Sena coalition, Mahayuti . While Sunetra has neither the voter connect nor the politician’s charisma. Political analyst Abhay Deshpande says Supriya may leverage the victim card while Sunetra, being a novice, can only bank on her husband’s track record.Additionally, Supriya faces antiincumbency sentiments, he says. Situation on the ground, meanwhile, seems favourable for Sunetra. Of the six assembly segments under Baramati Lok Sabha seat, four are with the governing Mahayuti — two with NCP and two with BJP; and two with Congress which, along with NCP (SCP), is part of the opposition alliance Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA). So, in Baramati LS seat, Sharad Pawar’s faction does not have any MLA while his nephew’s group has two — Baramati assembly seat (which Ajit Pawar himself represents) and Indapur (NCP’s Dattatray Bharne).After former state ministers Harshvardhan Patil (BJP) and Vijay Shivtare (Shiv Sena), who holds sway in Indapur and Purandar and were earlier at odds with Ajit Pawar, declared their support for the deputy CM, he is now hoping to get support in Khadakwasla and Daund, the two assembly segments held by BJP. On the other hand, Supriya is counting on support from loyalists and sympathy for her father, besides votes from the two Congress-led assembly constituencies of Bhor and Purandar.A look at Sharad and Ajit Pawar’s career graphs shows that they both had humble beginnings and meteoric rises. In the early 1960s, Yashwantrao Chavan, the then chief minister, spotted potential in Sharad Pawar during his college days in Pune. Sharad Pawar grew influential in Youth Congress and at 27, he won his first assembly polls from Baramati, followed by becoming Maharashtra’s youngest CM and getting central ministerial berths.Under his uncle’s guidance, Ajit started as a director in a sugar cooperative. In 1991, he made his political debut and won the Baramati LS seat. However, he had to resign later to accommodate his uncle’s central ministerial duties. Rising swiftly, Ajit secured the Baramati assembly seat and became a minister in Sudhakarrao Naik-led Congress govt in Maharashtra. Sharad Pawar splitting from Congress in 1999 and forming NCP further spurred Ajit’s ascent.Becoming a key figure, Ajit extended his influence statewide while his uncle focused on national affairs. Through all of this, the uncle-nephew rivalry, even if subdued, existed, political analysts say. It reached its peak in 2019 when a rebellious Ajit Pawar marched to Raj Bhavan and took oath as the deputy CM, aligning with BJP’s Devendra Fadnavis as the CM. This honeymoon proved shortlived and Ajit returned to the fold. The cracks, however, remained.“Within NCP, there were always two factions. This led to frequent power struggles between the two. The fact that Ajit is scarcely mentioned in his uncle’s autobiography, ‘Lok Maze Sangati’, points to the long-standing differences between them,” says Prakash Pawar, professor of political science at Shivaji University, Kolhapur.In 2023, Sharad Pawar declared he would step down as NCP’s national president, a position Ajit vied for. Later, he reversed this decision following overwhelming demand from followers. Eventually, in July that year, Ajit decided it was time to fulfil his ambitions and joined the Eknath Shinde-led govt, along with a group of MLAs and MLCs. The Baramati seat, with the Pawars since 1996 (Sharad Pawar from 1996 to 2009 and Supriya Sule from 2009 to 2019), is the only Maharashtra seat which will see a woman vs woman battle.","Sharad Pawar has anointed his three-time MP daughter, Supriya Sule, to lead the charge from Baramati, which is the family's citadel. Ajit Pawar, currently one of Maharashtra’s two deputy CMs, has fielded his wife, Sunetra Pawar.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109797426,imgsize-825764,width-400,resizemode-4/109797426.jpg"

ANAND/RAJKOT: PM Modi Thursday slammed an INDIA bloc constituent’s call for “vote jihad” as “an insult to democracy and Constitution”.PM said he found the remark of Maria Alam, SP candidate and niece of Congress veteran Salman Khurshid, at a rally in UP all the more shocking as it came “from a person belonging to an educated Muslim family and not someone who studied in a madrassa”.During his Gujarat campaign, PM also picked on a Pakistan ex-minister’s praise for Rahul Gandhi on X as a reflection of the neighbour’s “desperation to see the shehzada become the next PM so that India gets a weak govt”.“Pakistan is weeping because Congress is dying here,” PM said of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf’s Fawad Hussain Chaudhry sharing a video of the Wayanad MP & commenting, “Rahul on fire...”.We have heard about ‘love jihad’ and ‘land Jihad’ so far. This campaign for vote jihad is the latest. I presume you all know what the meaning of ‘jihad’ is,” PM told a gathering in Anand, Gujarat’s milk city. “Worse, not a single Congress functionary has condemned it yet.”Modi also tore into Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge for his allegedly disparaging remarks about Ram and Shiva devotees, accusing him of trying to create a rift among Hindus in pursuance of his party’s “appeasement” of Muslims.At an election rally in Surendranagar, the PM said, “Congress chief Kharge has made a very dangerous statement with malafide intentions. They (Congress) aim to create differences among devotees of Ram and Shiva so that they fight with each other. Even the Mughals could not break our traditions dating back thousands of years, but now Congress wants to break it?”Modi iterated that the Congress manifesto smacked of “Muslim League’s declarations”, carrying forward its intent to grant reservation based on religion to Muslims for three decades.“Congress betrayed the Constitution...Its manifesto proposes a separate quota for minorities, especially Muslims, in the allocation of all govt tenders,” he said“Govt contracts are not awarded based on caste or religion. But Congress wants to do that for its vote bank. Govt buys arms and ammunition for our Army from private players. So, are we going to give contracts to people from a specific religion or select qualified contractors?”Declaring that nobody would be able to divide the country until he was alive, the PM announced the launch of a nationwide campaign to spread awareness about the Constitution after the vote count on June 4.“I will expose this gang that wants to alter the Constitution. I will reach out to people living in every corner of the country.

Congress altered quota system several times to benefit Muslims: BJP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-altered-quota-system-several-times-to-benefit-muslims-bjp/articleshow/109796042.cms,"NEW DELHI: Responding to senior Congress veteran P Chidambaram’s claim that PM Narendra Modi continued to fight ghosts in his election speeches on the quota issue , BJP on Thursday circulated a long list of occasions when the quota system was altered especially to benefit the Muslim community .“Congress ensured that SC/ST reservation , as mandated by the Constitution, was removed from Aligarh Muslim University (1981) and Jamia Millia Islamia (2011) in favour of Muslims, even though both are govt funded.Congress also ensured that ‘minority’ institutions, even if state funded, don’t have to provide reservations for SC/ST/OBCs,” BJP IT department head Amit Malviya said as he posted a list of times when the quota structure was altered. He said not just this, Congress tried to give reservation to Muslims in Andhra Pradesh five times but the courts struck it down every time.After citing several attempts by Congress to introduce 5% Muslim quota in govt jobs and educational institutions between 2004-14, BJP claimed that in June 2013, then minority affairs minister K Rahman Khan said UPA was committed to implement a 4.5% Muslim quota. “Finally, the UPA govt went to SC to plead for Muslim reservation. The SC clubbed the central Muslim quota case of UPA govt with the Andhra Pradesh Muslim quota case and heard the matter through a constitutional bench,” Malviya said.Rebutting Chidambaram’s claim, Malviya said the 2024 Congress manifesto unequivocally implied Muslim reservation. “For instance, what is the difference between Point 3 and Point 6 in the minorities section of the manifesto? Point 3 says ‘encourage’ minorities to take full advantage of opportunities. If the Congress manifesto had limited itself to just this, it would have been okay. But Point 6 says ‘ensure’ minorities receive ‘fair share’ on exactly the same issues as mentioned in Point 3,” Malviya said.Meanwhile, Baby Rani Maurya, a senior minister in Yogi Adityanath’s cabinet and a known Dalit face, cited the several positions she held, from governor to a senior minister, and said Congress and its allies should respond to Modi’s “challenge” that there will not be any alteration in the quota system to accommodate Muslims for their politics of appeasement and vote bank.","BJP circulated a long list of occasions when the quota system was altered especially to benefit the Muslim community. “Congress ensured that SC/ST reservation was removed from Aligarh Muslim University (1981) and Jamia Millia Islamia (2011) in favour of Muslims,” BJP IT department head Amit Malviya said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109796038,imgsize-2481642,width-400,resizemode-4/109796038.jpg"

Revanth Reddy to voters: Don't let BJP govt 'abolish' quotas,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/lok-sabha-elections/telangana/news/revanth-reddy-to-voters-dont-let-bjp-govt-abolish-quotas/city/hyderabad/revanth-reddy-to-voters-dont-let-bjp-govt-abolish-quotas/articleshow/109800415.cms,"Exposed Delhi sultans’ plan & they’re after me: Revanth Reddy

HYDERABAD: Keeping up the tempo on the quota issue, chief minister A Revanth Reddy accused the NDA govt of deliberately not conducting the 2021 census as part of its ""hidden agenda to abolish the reservations "".Addressing a public meeting in Asifabad on Thursday in support of Congress candidate Atram Suguna, Revanth asked the people not to let the BJP scrap the reservations and instead scrap the BJP altogether from India's map.""If you (people) vote for the BJP, it is a vote to remove the reservations,"" he said.The CM said India had been conducting census regularly since 1881 when it was first done by then British govt.""If a caste-based census is completed, they need to provide more than 50 per cent reservation to SCs, STs and OBCs. Any attempt to eliminate reservations would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament and approval of at least 50% of states' assemblies. For the same reason, the BJP is aiming to secure 400 seats in Parliament to achieve its objectives,"" he said and alleged that the BJP along with RSS was working to implement 'Manu theory' in India.Claiming that he was being targeted by ‘Delhi sultans’ (BJP govt at the Centre), he said: “I have exposed their grand plan. So, they are after me. I am not scared. With your support, Revanth Reddy will fight them and question them. It is not new to me. The previous BRS govt also booked many cases against me. Even if the Delhi sultans attack me, I will not bow down.”Highlighting the achievements of the Congress govt in Telangana, Revanth said five out of the six guarantees had been fulfilled within the first 100 days of coming to power. He criticised the former BRS regime for neglecting the issue of podu land.Meanwhile, Revanth Reddy criticised PM Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah, alleging that they got the jobs they wanted but did not provide jobs to millions of youths. Addressing a street corner meeting in Quthbullapur in support of Malkajgiri Congress candidate Sunitha Mahender Reddy, he said: “When Modi took over as prime minister in 2014, he said he will create two crore jobs every year. By now, we should have 20 crore jobs. On the other hand, India is faring worst in unemployment. At 65% unemployment, our numbers are the most alarming in the world. Why should we vote for him. Time has come to say ‘bye’ to him.”In three meetings at Asifabad, Siddipet and Quthbullapur, Revanth made cadre shout slogans loudly that the Modi govt had delivered only ‘donkey’s egg’ to the state. He carried a symbolic egg with the caption ‘donkey’s egg to Telangana’ at his meetings.","Revanth Reddy accused the NDA govt of deliberately not conducting the 2021 census as part of its ""hidden agenda to abolish the reservations"" He asked the people not to let the BJP scrap the reservations and instead scrap the BJP altogether from India's map.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109800497,imgsize-31104,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/109800497.jpg"

Quota based on religion did not cross our minds: Sharad Pawar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/quota-based-on-religion-did-not-cross-our-minds-sharad-pawar/articleshow/109799974.cms,"KOLHAPUR: NCP (SCP) chief Sharad Pawar said on Thursday that giving reservations on the basis of religion had not crossed the minds of INDIA bloc politicians, adding that the alliance categorically disapproved of the idea of reservation on the basis of religion.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while speaking in a rally in Gujarat on Wednesday, said that under the caste-census, the INDIA bloc would expand the reservation quota and grant reservation to Muslims .The prime minister had said that he would not let that happen so long he was alive, describing it as a dirty game.Addressing press conference on Thursday in Kolhapur, Pawar said the prime minister was coming up with twisted ideas such as reservation for Muslims, Congress snatching mangalsutra etc, which were not discussed in INDIA bloc meetings nor mentioned in the manifesto.Pawar said, ""The idea of reservation on the basis of religion has never touched our minds. We disapprove the idea totally. If somebody tries, even if Modi tries, we will resist.""On Modi targeting the socio-economic census that the INDIA bloc had proposed to carry out, Pawar said that it would be done to understand where the smaller communities stand, and the picture should come to the fore before the country. ""We insist on doing this because we want smaller communities to be brought in the process of development. For that we need to understand their population, where they reside and few more things,"" said Pawar.Modi recently accused INDIA alliance, saying that if INDIA alliance does not have any PM face then alliance leaders will plan to change the prime minister every year if it wins. Pawar said that there is no need to worry who will be PM after INDIA wins.Pawar said, ""We have discussed no such thing. I don't know how Modi comes up with such ideas. There was no discussion regarding PM face during INDIA meetings. In 1977, under Jay Prakash Narayan's clarion call, all opposition united to defeat Congress. The opposition parties later sat together and name of Morarji Our role will be to stay strong behind the leader to ensure that the govt remains stable and completes five-year tenure. Modi is day-dreaming about new PM every year, it is in his mind not ours,"" said Pawar.When asked whether opposition is trying instil fear in the minds of people over his repeat narrative of 'Modi becoming Putin' (Russia's president) and Modi will change the Constitution to remain in power forever, Pawar said, ""His behaviour so far, the decisions taken so far shows that we need to be alert. I will not directly say that he will definitely become Putin like, but leaders and people should be alert.""Pawar said that Sangli remained an exception in the seat-sharing discussion as Shiv Sena (UBT) declared the seat without discussion. ""It is just one such decision among 48 Lok Sabha seats. We saw the candidate declared in the evening on television. We started searching who is the candidate what is his contribution.

It's Lalu's daughter vs Laloo Prasad Yadav in Bihar's Saran Lok Sabha seat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/its-lalus-daughter-vs-laloo-prasad-yadav-in-bihars-saran-lok-sabha-seat/articleshow/109799909.cms,"PATNA:

Rohini Acharya

, the daughter of RJD chief Lalu Prasad, is facing an unexpected challenge in her bid to reclaim the Saran Lok Sabha seat, once held by her father. The challenger is a local farmer from Saran district who shares the same name as the socialist leader -

.

This namesake contestant has a history of participating in various elections.

Laloo Prasad Yadav, the farmer, filed his nomination papers as a candidate of the Rashtriya Jansambhavna Party (RJP) for the Saran Lok Sabha seat on April 26. He had previously filed nominations for the 2022 and 2017 presidential polls, although his papers were rejected in the 2017 election due to a lack of endorsement from the required number of proposers.

The 2017 Presidential polls saw a contest between the then Bihar governor Ram Nath Kovind, who emerged victorious, and former Lok Sabha speaker Meira Kumar, a native of the region.

In a phone interview, Laloo Prasad Yadav expressed his determination to win the election by a comfortable margin.

""I have been contesting Lok Sabha polls from Saran constituency for the last several terms. I had contested against former Bihar chief minister Rabri Devi as well.

This time, I am contesting against her daughter Rohini Acharya,"" he said.

Yadav, who engaged in agriculture and social work, remained undeterred by his opponents labeling him as a 'dharti pakad' (one who clings on to the earth) or a 'vote katwa' (one who divides votes).

According to the affidavit filed by the RJP candidate, Yadav has Rs 5 lakh cash in hand, while his wife has Rs 2 lakh. He owns movable assets worth Rs 17.60 lakh, and his wife owns movable assets worth Rs 5.20 lakh.

Despite the financial disparity between him and his opponents, Yadav remains confident in his ability to secure the support of the Saran electorate.","Laloo Prasad Yadav, the farmer, filed his nomination papers as a candidate of the Rashtriya Jansambhavna Party (RJP) for the Saran Lok Sabha seat on April 26.

Bose asked her on April 19 to meet him with her CV; she went to meet him on April 24 at 12.45 pm, when he ""touched her inappropriately and made untoward advances"", the complaint says. Bose again called her to his office on Thursday but the woman, instead of going alone, asked her supervisor to accompany her. The woman told cops that Bose asked the supervisor to leave after some time, following which he assured her of a promotion and then ""touched her cheek"", prompting her to protest.A video circulating since the evening shows the woman complaining to a senior cop that she had been molested. ""This is not the first time this has happened to me,"" she is heard saying on phone before explaining why she had not complained earlier: ""I had kept quiet as I was scared of losing my (contractual) job."" She felt impelled to complain on Thursday, after the latest incident , to protect others from facing the ordeal she had faced. She is also seen referring to another woman who made similar complaints in the past.""We are duty-bound to register a case and begin a probe since a woman has lodged this complaint,"" a senior police officer said. Other seniors told TOI they had recorded the woman's statement but did not register any FIR. ""Article 361 of the Indian Constitution insulates the governor from any criminal proceeding while in office,"" another senior official said, adding that legal experts would be consulted.Raj Bhavan issued a statement a couple of hours later. ""Truth shall triumph. I refuse to be cowed by engineered narratives. If anybody wants some election benefits by maligning me, God bless them. But they cannot stop my fight against corruption and violence in Bengal,"" it read. Another statement thanked Raj Bhavan staff ""who expressed solidarity against derogatory narratives circulated by two disgruntled employees as political parties' agents"".Yet another release issued after 10pm banned the entry of cops and state finance minister Chandrima Bhattacharya in Raj Bhavan premises. The cop ban was to prevent their entry ""in the guise of conducting unauthorised, illegitimate, sham and motivated investigations to placate political bosses during election"", the statement said, banning minister Bhattacharya's entry in Raj Bhavan premises in Kolkata, Darjeeling and Barrackpore. Governor C V Ananda Bose would not attend any finance department event, the statement said, adding that the attorney-general would be consulted for legal steps against Bhattacharya. PM Narendra Modi reached Raj Bhavan at 10pm, where he stayed the night. He is slated to leave Raj Bhavan on Friday morning for campaigning in East Burdwan, Nadia and Birbhum.The TMC posted on X: ""Appalling and unthinkable! The sanctity of Raj Bhavan, a symbol of our constitutionality, has been tarnished. Hours before the PM was supposed to arrive at Raj Bhavan to spend the night, a woman was allegedly molested by the governor under the false pretext of a job. Such despicable behaviour must be condemned in the strongest terms. Justice must be delivered swiftly for the victim, no excuses, no delays!"" Finance minister Bhattacharya condemned ""the alleged misconduct by the governor"", which she called ""unbecoming of any official, especially the head of State"", before demanding ""an immediate and a thorough investigation"".The BJP response was more nuanced.

Clash of the titans in Raigad to feel impact of split in Sena & NCP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/lok-sabha-elections/maharashtra/news/clash-of-the-titans-in-raigad-to-feel-impact-of-split-in-sena-ncp/articleshow/109800050.cms,"RAIGAD: The coastal district of Raigad in Konkan, around 100km from Mumbai, hosts luxury villas of the city’s elite in its Alibaug belt. But large parts of the district remain underdeveloped and face the brunt of recurring landslides and cyclones. It’s here in a region dominated by farmers and fishermen that sitting MP Sunil Tatkare , the state chief of the NCP led by Ajit Pawar , takes on Anant Geete from the Shiv Sena led by Uddhav Thackeray, who has represented the Konkan region six times.Tatkare had defeated Geete in the 2019 polls by over 31,000 votes, when he had contested from an undivided NCP.Tatkare, who has been in the state cabinet multiple times, had faced several controversies including allegations of irregularities in irrigation contracts and a disproportionate assets case. Geete, a close associate of party founder Bal Thackeray, has had several stints in the Union cabinet, handling the power and heavy industries portfolio.This election will test the impact of the BJP-triggered split in Shiv Sena as well as NCP. In 2019, Geete had the support of BJP , Shiv Sena’s ally. This time, Tatkare is a candidate of the BJP-led Mahayuti. Only one of the six assembly segments in the district has an MLA from Shiv Sena (UBT).On the ground, though, there are strong views about the splitting of the parties in a region which has been a stronghold of the Shiv Sena. “We voted for the NCP’s Tatkare in the last election and now his party has joined hands with the BJP. There is no respect for the voter,” says shopkeeper Gyanchand Jaiswal in Mhasale village.Tatkare will lose the support of the Peasants and Workers Party which commands 2 lakh votes in this region and is part of the INDIA alliance. Also, he is likely to lose a substantial Muslim vote in the region. This is why NCP recently inducted ex-MLC Mushtaq Antulay, son-in-law of former chief minister A R Antulay.However, this has not pacified Muslim voters who are unhappy with Tatkare’s ties with the BJP. “It’s a party that does not think of us and does not have space for us,” said a Muslim vegetable vendor. The large chunk of Kunbi votes here are likely to go to Geete who is from the community.The campaign is seeing the opponents make personal attacks on each other. Tatkare says Geete has largely been missing from the constituency. “There is a lot of anger against Geete. When I lost the polls in 2014, I remained with the people. But after Geete lost in 2019, he went missing. He was not there during the pandemic or during the floods or cyclones,” Tatkare told TOI.Geete says Tatkare’s betrayal of NCP founder Sharad Pawar and corruption charges will go against him. “In 2019, the BJP had called the NCP the National Corrupt Party. Now Tatkare is their ally. People will not accept this,” he told TOI. “This is an election of bhrashtachar (corruption) versus sadachar (good conduct). And sadachar will win,” he said. Having represented the area multiple times, Geete faces charges of failing to uplift the district. Mumbai-Goa highway which is incomplete after a decade is a sticking point. “The highway comes under Central govt. If I am elected, I will pursue it,” says Geete.Tatkare faces allegations of dynastic politics. His daughter Aditi Tatkare is an MLA and state minister while his son Aniket Tatkare is an MLC. Tatkare’s brother Anil Tatkare was an MLC and nephew Avadhut Tatkare was an MLA. For Tatkare, animosity from within is an added challenge. Mahad MLA Bharat Gogawale from the Shiv Sena of chief minister Eknath Shinde has been sulking after he was overlooked for state cabinet.","Sunil Tatkare, the state chief of the NCP led by Ajit Pawar, takes on Anant Geete from the Shiv Sena led by Uddhav Thackeray.
