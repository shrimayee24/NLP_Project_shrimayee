THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Tension gripped Neyyattinkara in Kerala’s Thiruvananthapuram district on Wednesday evening after RSS activists staged a protest against Mahatma Gandhi ’s grandson, Tushar Gandhi during the unveiling of Gandhian representative Gopinathan Nair’s statue at his residence at TB Junction.The protest was triggered by Tushar’s remark during his speech that “the soul of the nation is afflicted with cancer, and the Sangh Parivar is spreading it”.Outraged BJP and RSS activists demanded a retraction and an apology. Tushar, however, stood by his remark, and chanted “hail, Gandhi”, before leaving. The protesters shouted slogans and blocked his car, but Tushar refused to back down and countered with slogans like “down with RSS” and “long live Gandhi”, before exiting the venue.Congress condemned RSS-BJP activists, with party’s state chief K Sudhakaran accusing them of being haunted by “(Nathuram) Godse’s ghost”. He also questioned CPM’s silence on the incident.","RSS activists staged a protest against Mahatma Gandhi ’s grandson, Tushar Gandhi during the unveiling of Gandhian representative Gopinathan Nair’s statue at TB Junction.

PATNA: For the second time in a week, chief minister Nitish Kumar and his predecessor Rabri Devi engaged in a heated exchange in the Bihar Legislative Council on Wednesday.While Nitish said Rabri was the “CM of circumstances”, the former CM accused the JD(U) leader of “insulting the women folks”.Trouble began when CPI-ML member, Shashi Yadav, rose from her seat to submit before the House that she was not satisfied with the govt’s reply to her question. The CM reacted by saying the govt is doing so much for women while the previous govt did nothing. This irked Rabri, who rose to intervene, asking the govt to bring the records of that period to know what was done by the previous govt.Reacting sharply to her observations, Nitish accused RJD chief Lalu Prasad of installing his wife as the CM when he was forced to step down. Rabri hit back, accusing the CM of “disrespecting” all women folk through his words, alleging no substantial work was done under his leadership before staging a walkout with opposition members in protest.Rabri first became the CM in 1997 when her husband Lalu Prasad resigned as CM, after the CBI submitted a chargesheet against him in the multi-crore fodder scam. She ruled the state for eight years.Nitish in his speech had informed the House how his govt had done a lot for every class, including women, who were granted 50% reservation in panchayati raj institutions and how it launched several initiatives to empower the women. He reiterated that he won’t go back to the opposition alliance any more asserting “Ab sab din ke liye saath rahange...idhar-udhar nahin jayenge (I won’t waver, will remain with the NDA always).”","Rabri first became the CM in 1997 when her husband Lalu Prasad resigned as CM, after the CBI submitted a chargesheet against him in the multi-crore fodder scam.

BENGALURU: Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah backed his Tamil Nadu counterpart MK Stalin’s campaign against the proposed population-based delimitation exercise with a call to action on Wednesday, contrasting with his deputy DK Shivakumar calling for a nuanced approach based on the party high command’s “final call”.A Tamil Nadu delegation met Siddaramaiah in Bengaluru and Stalin reached out to him over phone, proposing a joint action committee consisting of representatives of several states to collectively oppose the delimitation move.A statement from the CMO confirmed Karnataka’s alignment with the protest against what the southern states call “an undemocratic stance” to carry out delimitation without everyone on board.Stalin requested Karnataka to nominate a senior Congress representative to coordinate a unified strategy. A preliminary meeting is scheduled for March 22 in Chennai.The delegation led by TN forest minister K Ponmudy and Rajya Sabha member Mohammad Abdullah Ismail discussed with Siddaramaiah the need to challenge the alleged bias against southern states, the CMO said. Siddaramaiah said Congress “unequivocally condemns all actions of the Union govt that are against Karnataka’s interest, weaken democracy and go against the federal principles of the Constitution”.The proposed joint action committee could have members from Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, West Bengal, Odisha and Punjab. DMK has been reaching out to functionaries across party lines, including NDA allies like Andhra Pradesh CM N Chandrababu Naidu.Shivakumar said DMK being Congress’s ally, the party appreciated its stance. “However, as a national party, we must consult our high command and proceed based on their guidance.”DMK member D M Kathir Anand in Lok Sabha on Wednesday said the impending delimitation exercise penalises progressive states like Tamil Nadu which have controlled population growth and asked the govt to ensure equitable representation of all states in Parliament and state assemblies.Flagging the issue during Zero Hour, he said, “ Govt should consider economic performance and vital indices like GSDP, per capita income, infrastructure improvement and not just population while doing the delimitation exercise”.The delimitation issue was also raised by BJP member Nishikant Dubey who flagged instances of Bangladeshi infiltrators entering India through the borders of West Bengal, and said Centre should exclude them when conducting delimitation.",Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah backed his Tamil Nadu counterpart MK Stalin’s campaign against the proposed population-based delimitation exercise.

BENGALURU: Within 24 hours of announcing a CID probe into a police escort being provided to actor Ranya Rao at Bengaluru airport , where she was arrested by DRI sleuths last week for allegedly smuggling 14.2 kg gold from Dubai, Karnataka govt has withdrawn the nod for the investigation.Sources said the U-turn follows pressure from certain quarters, which feared any disclosure by the police constable intercepted by central revenue sleuths while escorting Ranya, daughter of DGP (Karnataka Police Housing Corporation) Ramachandra Rao, could put the police brass in a tight spot. The state home department justified the withdrawal, citing another investigation being carried out by senior IAS officer and additional chief secretary Gaurav Gupta to ascertain the role of the state protocol wing and that of DGP Rao.The head constable, identified as Basavaraj from the airport police station, on Tuesday gave a statement to CBI that he had “only complied with oral instructions from senior IPS officers” regarding receiving and dropping their family members at the airport, and had no clue about gold smuggling.On why the CID probe was withdrawn, a senior IPS officer said cryptically: “The CID probe was ordered by the home department; the decision to withdraw it, too, was made by the home department.”","Karnataka govt withdraws a CID probe into a police escort provided to actor Ranya Rao at Bengaluru airport.

Result shows people’s faith in BJP: Modi

CHANDIGARH: BJP dominated the municipal polls in Haryana, winning nine of the 10 mayoral seats Wednesday and dealing another heavy blow to Congress after the saffron party’s resounding assembly election victory to retain office for a third consecutive term last Oct.BJP’s triumph in the polls held on March 2 extended across key municipal corporations, including Gurgaon, Faridabad, Hisar, Rohtak, Karnal, Yamunanagar, Panipat, Ambala, and Sonipat. The lone exception was Manesar, where Union minister Rao Inderjeet Singh-backed independent candidate Inderjeet Yadav clinched victory.Woman candidates secured seven of the 10 mayoral positions. BJP’s Parveen Joshi won the mayoral post in Faridabad, defeating Congress’s Lata Rani by the largest margin of 316,852 votes.CM Nayab Singh Saini hailed BJP’s sweeping victory as a public endorsement of the party’s governance. “The results show that people want a ‘triple-engine’ govt and approve of our development work,” he said.State local bodies minister Vipul Goel presented the results in assembly, saying BJP also claimed 90% of the councillor seats.Former CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda suffered a setback in his stronghold of Rohtak, where BJP retained the mayoral seat despite Congress holding both LS and assembly seats in the region. Congress MLA Vinesh Phogat also failed to secure a win in Julana, where BJP candidates won the municipal committee polls.Hooda downplayed the defeat, attributing it to a focus on “local issues and bhaichara (brotherhood)” rather than party politics. “If you check the final tally, you may find more Congress councillors this time,” he said.Congress functionary Capt Ajay Yadav pointed to a weak grassroots structure as a key factor in the party’s poor performance.Three members of a Yadav family — Deepak, his wife Rashmi, and his brother Pawan —won as independent candidates in Faridabad’s municipal councillor elections.BJP lost in Kaithal district, where independents defeated the party nominees in Siwan, Kalayat and Pundri municipal committees.BJP’s sweep of urban body polls in Haryana on Wednesday had BJP in a joyous mood, with PM Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah leading the celebrations. This victory is an expression of unwavering faith of the people in the development work being carried out by the Saini govt, Modi said, adding, “I assure the people of the state that we will leave no stone unturned to fulfil their hopes and aspirations.”Shah congratulated CM Saini and state party chief Mohan Lal Badauli for the victory. “Haryana has faith only in Modi ji. After the landslide victory in the Haryana polls, I am very grateful to the people of Haryana for giving their blessings to BJP in the civic poll as well,” he said. Under the leadership of Modi ji, BJP has become the first choice of people from the ward to the Vidhan Sabha, and from the panchayat to Parliament,” he said on X.","Haryana CM Nayab Singh Saini hailed BJP’s sweeping victory as a public endorsement of the party's governance. “The results show that people want a ‘triple-engine’ govt and approve of our development work,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118949888,imgsize-136958,width-400,resizemode-4/118949888.jpg"

JAMMU: The ministry of home affairs (MHA) has returned a proposal for sanctioning the prosecution of three IAS officers of AGMUT cadre allegedly involved in arms licences scam in Jammu and Kashmir, citing missing documents, and directed the chief secretary to resubmit the proposal with all the documents within a week.The IAS officers in question include Yasha Mudgal (2007 batch), Shahid Iqbal Choudhary (2009 batch) and Niraj Kumar (2010 batch).According to MHA’s March 8 directive, the revised submission must include FIR copies, witness statements, investigation reports, recovery memos, and legal department opinions, among other documents.The sanction proposal for two other IAS officers who had served in Ladakh should be sent with administrative approval, it added. Earlier, in a communication on Feb 12, MHA had instructed the J&K chief secretary to forward CBI’s prosecution sanction proposals for M Raju (then DM Kargil) and Prasanna Ramaswamy G (then DM Leh), with the approval of the lieutenant governor of Ladakh.The General Administration Department of J&K had submitted a status report on Dec 27, 2024, informing the J&K and Ladakh High Court that the UT administration’s proposal on the three IAS officers had been forwarded to MHA for a final decision.The case of IAS officer P K Pole was still under review, while clarification had been sought regarding the jurisdictional aspect for Prasanna Ramaswamy and Raju, it was conveyed to the court.The next hearing in the arms licences scam case is scheduled before a division bench on March 20.Since 2019, CBI has been probing irregularities in granting more than 2,78,000 arms licences in J&K between 2012 and 2016, with district magistrates (DMs), deputy commissioners (DCs) and licensing authorities accused of issuing licences for monetary considerations.CBI had sought sanction against a total of eight IAS officers posted in different districts of J&K.On Feb 21 this year, CBI had booked J&K’s labour and employment department secretary Kumar Rajeev Ranjan and his family members for allegedly amassing disproportionate assets more than their known sources of income.A 2010-batch IAS officer, Ranjan, who was earlier Kupwara DC, is under the central probe agency’s scanner over granting of thousands of arms licences to non-residents in J&K. In Nov 2024, the Centre had granted sanction to prosecute Ranjan.The entire racket was unearthed by Rajasthan Police in 2017, which wrote several letters to the then J&K govt but did not receive any response. The Rajasthan Anti-Terrorism Squad claimed 1,32,321 of the 1,43,013 licences in Doda, Ramban and Udhampur districts in Jammu region were issued to those residing outside the J&K. The figure for the entire J&K was estimated to be 4,29,301, of which only 10% of the licences were issued to its residents.","The IAS officers in question include Yasha Mudgal (2007 batch), Shahid Iqbal Choudhary (2009 batch) and Niraj Kumar (2010 batch) The revised submission must include FIR copies, witness statements, investigation reports, recovery memos, and legal department opinions, among other documents.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118946138,imgsize-25834,width-400,resizemode-4/118946138.jpg"
