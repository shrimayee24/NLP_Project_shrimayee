When a person joins the Army, his parents or guardians’ names are recorded as NOK. When that cadet or officer gets married, under Army rules, the name of the person’s spouse is recorded as the person’s NOK instead of the parents.Captain’s father Ravi Pratap Singh and mother Manju Singh, in an interview to a TV channel, said they want change in NOK rules as their daughter-in-law Smriti Singh doesn’t live with them any more and she has changed her address (in office records) and that she now receives most entitlements after their son’s death.“The criteria set to NOK is not correct. I have also spoken to defence minister Rajnath Singh about this. Anshuman’s wife doesn’t live with us now, the marriage was just five months old and there is no child. Though we are the co-recipient of Kirti Chakra. We now just have a photo of our son hanging on the wall with a garland on it. We can’t place the Kriti Chakra on his photo as his wife took it away,” Singh said.Captain Anshuman’s father said some rules were changed after the 1999 Kargil War for the dead soldier’s dependents. Similarly, the NOK rules should be revisited. He also claimed that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has also assured them that he would take up the matter with the defence minister.Captain Singh’s mother said they want govt to revisit the NOK rules so that parents like them and dependents of the dead soldiers don’t have to suffer in future.",Captain’s wife Smriti Singh and mother Manju Singh recently received the Kirti Chakra.

The observance of 'Samvidhan Hatya Diwas' will help keep the eternal flame of individual freedom and the defence of our democracy alive in every Indian, thus preventing dictatorial forces like the Congress from repeating those horrors.”BJP's pushback, which started during the campaign with Modi denying the charge and saying that the boot was on the opposition's foot by pointing to efforts under Congress govts to bring in quotas for Muslims not allowed under the law, has since continued apace.President Droupadi Murmu, in her address to the joint sitting of Parliament, made a detailed reference to the Emergency and Modi spoke about it on multiple occasions, including in his customary media address ahead of the Parliament session and also in his reply to the debate on the President’s address.It can also bring out contradictions among opposition ranks on the issue as some important allies of Congress — from SP and RJD to DMK and CPM — were victims of excesses during Emergency.On the last day of the first session of the 18th Lok Sabha, they did not join Congress's protests against the statement read out by Speaker Om Birla to condemn the Emergency.","The Centre on Friday notified June 25, the anniversary of the imposition of the Emergency in the country in 1975 by the then PM Indira Gandhi, as ‘Samvidhan Hatya Diwas’“(It is)… a tribute to all those who suffered and fought against the gross misuse of power during the period of Emergency,” the Union home ministry stated in its gazette notification.

Each day of last 10 years a murder of democracy: Congress,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/each-day-of-last-10-years-a-murder-of-democracy-congress/articleshow/111698335.cms,"NEW DELHI: Accusing Modi government of celebrating each day of the past ten years as "" Samvidhaan Hatya Diwas "" with ""undeclared emergency"", Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge said PM Narendra Modi has insulted Ambedkar by suffixing ""murder"" to a sacred word like ""Constitution"". He said the usage is reflective of BJP-RSS's desire to replace the Constitution with ""manusmriti"" and targeting the rights of Dalits, tribals and backwards.AICC spokesman Jairam Ramesh mocked it as Modi's ""another headline grabbing exercise in hypocrisy"" since he is smarting from the ""moral, political and personal defeat"" in the polls which will go down in history as ""Modi Mukti Diwas"". ""It is a PM for whom democracy means only demo-kursi,"" he added.Kharge, in an open letter to the PM on X, said, ""Defence of the Constitution does not sound good from your mouth... every moment in power, you have snatched self respect from every poor and deprived section of the country.""The Congress chief said when a BJP functionary urinates on a tribal in MP or when UP govt forcibly cremates a Dalit girl in Hathras, it is the ""murder of the Constitution"". He asked Modi to answer if it is not ""Samvidhaan hatya"" that six Dalit women are raped every day, ""illegal bulldozer justice"" is meted out to minorities with 1.5 lakh houses demolished rendering 7.38 lakh citizens homeless in two years, and when the PM does not like to visit Manipur despite the state being in the grip of violence for past 13 months.As BJP devised the new offensive on emergency as a weapon to counter the opposition which has not let go of its election time charge that the ruling party is conspiring to junk the Constitution, Congress sought to keep the focus trained on Ambedkar and the marginalised sections where it finds the rival vulnerable - a tack that brought rich dividends to INDIA bloc in national polls.Kharge said BJP-RSS-Jansangh never accepted the Constitution and the Organiser on Nov 30, 1949, derided it as bereft of Indianess, arguing that it shows the RSS as standing against Ambedkar and in favour of Manusmriti.","Mallikarjun Kharge said PM Narendra Modi has insulted Ambedkar by suffixing ""murder"" to a sacred word like ""Constitution"" He said the usage is reflective of BJP-RSS's desire to replace the Constitution with ""manusmriti"" and targeting the rights of Dalits and tribals.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111698342,imgsize-473034,width-400,resizemode-4/111698342.jpg"
