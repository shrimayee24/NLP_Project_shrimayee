EC gives losing candidates choice on how they want to check EVMs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ec-gives-losing-candidates-choice-on-how-they-want-to-check-evms/articleshow/111795678.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Election Commission has issued the standard operating procedure ( SOP ) for checking of burnt memory or micro-controller of electronic voting machines ( EVMs ) by the losing candidates , offering them multiple options for random testing rather than verification in a controlled environment.Candidates can select varied test inputs for thorough analysis, including choosing EVMs from any polling station in an assembly segment; mixing & matching ballot unit, control unit and VVPAT from any polling station to make an EVM set; and deciding the sequencing of connection of EVM units as well as the number & sequencing of votes cast in a mock poll.“The procedure is designed with a focus on outcome-based processes…The randomness and enormity of test vectors and expanded choice-based approach instead of controlled environment C&V process of burnt memory eliminates the possibility or apprehension of any bias or hidden functionality in the firmware, by showing the intended outcome(s) under parameters selected by the candidate and at every stage,” a senior EC official told TOI on Tuesday.The C&V process will be conducted under CCTV monitoring and also be videographed. It will be timed between 10 am and 7 pm and preferably completed in a single calendar day.Earlier on June 1, 2024, EC had — honouring the Supreme Court ruling allowing candidates who finish second and third in a poll to seek C&V of burnt memory and microcontroller of up to 5% of EVMs used in an assembly segment — had issued a detailed administrative SOP for the application process for C&V. Subsequently, a total of 8 applications for the recent Lok Sabha and 3 applications for state elections were received for checking/verification.Detailing the C&V choices available to candidates, EC said those who got the second and third highest votes in a recent election can pick EVMs from any polling stations of the constituency for C&V, subject to a maximum of 5% EVMs used in that AC/AS. This will rule out the involvement of a third party or officials, said a source.Candidates can also to mix and match EVM units — ballot unit, control unit of VVPAT — from any polling station in an assembly constituency: simply put, applicant candidate can choose BU from one polling station, CU from another and VVPAT from a third to make an EVM set for C&V process. Even the sequence of connecting the BU, CU and VVPAT may be decided by the candidate.All EVM units shall undergo self diagnosis when switched on. Several electrical parameters will be checked including the fidelity of the burnt memory and only self-diagnosed units will go for C&V. Also, EVM units selected after mix and match shall first undergo self-diagnosis, followed by mutual authentication. Successful mutual authentication takes place only between genuine ECI-EVM units and the result of the self-diagnosis of connected units is displayed on the CU.Candidates can choose any sequence or pattern to cast any number of votes for mock poll, subject to the maximum limit of 1400 votes. “ This latitude of choices ensures creation of a very large number of inputs to the EVMs by way of a combination of number of key presses and the sequence in which the keys are pressed. The CU records a vote only for the key button pressed on the BU(s) in the sequences or combinations in which they are pressed,” said an EC official.Counting of VVPAT slips in the mock poll shall be done as per the normal EC procedure followed in an actual poll.",The Election Commission has issued the standard operating procedure ( SOP) for checking of burnt memory or micro-controller of electronic voting machines.

Now it is the responsibility of BJP to do more for them in return, compared to what it has done already,"" the Union home minister said.BJP surprised pundits when it won a majority on its own in 2014 on the strength of a social bloc comprising OBCs who flocked to its platform because of their resentment against Jat dominance. The setback in the recent Lok Sabha polls where BJP lost five of the 10 seats has widely been attributed to anger among the dominant Jats who feel disempowered.Shah flagged decisions taken by CM Nayab Singh Saini, an OBC himself, for the community, including raising the creamy layer limit from Rs 6 lakh to Rs 8 lakh. ""Similarly, reservations in panchayats too have been reviewed. There was an 8% reservation for group A but from now on, 5% reservation will be given for group D also. The same is going to be applied to municipalities too. These decisions reflect the policies of PM Narendra Modi,"" Shah said.He recalled that when Modi entered Parliament for the first time in 2014, he said his govt would belong to Dalits, poor and backward classes, which has been delivered in the past 10 years.He thanked people of Haryana for blessing BJP in the 2014, 2019 and 2024 LS elections and also in both assembly polls held during this period.Referring to the nomination of Saini as CM, Shah said BJP had made the son of a backward class family chief minister in Haryana too whereas Congress had given the state nothing other than corruption and casteism.He said BJP gave the nation its first PM from the backward classes. ""Today, out of 71 ministers in his govt, Narendra Modi ji has inducted 27 ministers from backward classes, including two from Haryana,"" he said.",BJP surprised pundits when it won a majority on its own in 2014 on the strength of a social bloc comprising OBCs who flocked to its platform.

HC relief for Rahul Gandhi in RSS defamation case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hc-relief-for-rahul-gandhi-in-rss-defamation-case/articleshow/111792066.cms,"MUMBAI: Bombay high court slammed a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) worker for his attempts to delay trial in his 2014 defamation complaint against Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for alleged anti-RSS speech.“ It can be see that the respondent is keeping no stone unturned to thwart the legitimate right of the petitioner (Gandhi) to get the complaint decided on merits as expeditiously as possible in view of Article 21 (Right to Life) …which provides speedy trial, ’’ said Justice Prithviraj Chavan .On July 12 he quashed and set aside the June 3, 2023 order of a junior magistrate first class (JMFC), Bhiwandi, that permitted Rajesh Kunte to produce transcript of Gandhi’s March 6, 2014 speech in which he had allegedly said RSS people killed Mahatma Gandhi.In July 2014 after the magistrate issued summons, Gandhi moved HC to quash Kunte’s complaint. In March 2015 HC dismissed his plea. In Sept 2016 he withdrew his appeal in the Supreme Court. In June 2018 the JMFC framed charges and rejected Kunte’s plea to use the transcript as evidence. Kunte moved HC contending that Gandhi had used the transcript as exhibit to his HC petition and had owned up to the speech. In Sept 2021, HC rejected Kunte’s plea stating that transcript is not a public document and cannot be used as evidence.“The learned JMFC in the teeth of this order should not have exhibited the annexures in the form of a transcript of the contents of the CD containing the alleged speech,’’ said Justice Chavan.He said the transcript annexed with Gandhi’s petition was only for limited purpose to quash Kunte’s complaint and cannot be construed as Gandhi’s admission. He also said an accused has “a right has a right to remain silent.” He agreed with Gandhi’s advocates Sudeep Pasbola and Kushal Mor that Kunte has to prove the CD’s contents.It appears from the overall conduct of the respondent (Kunte) that the matter is being unnecessarily delayed and protracted,’’ Justice Chavan added. He also referred to HC’s June 2022 order upholding the magistrate’s refusal to issue witness summons to a notary who had notarised Gandhi’s petition. “It was another unsuccessful attempt to try and get the documents exhibited…,” said Justice Chavan.“Free and fair trial is a sine qua non of Article 21. It is trite that justice should not only be done but it should be seen to be done,’’ he added. He said the “JMFC appears to have completely disregarded the cardinal principle of criminal jurisprudence while exhibiting the annexures” and also violated HC’s orders. Allowing Gandhi’s petition, Justice Chavan directed the JMFC “to decide and dispose of the complaint as expeditiously as possible given the pendency of ten years.”",Bombay high court slams RSS worker for his attempts to delay trial.

Addressing a 'Backward Classes Samman Sammelan' here, Shah referred to the Kaka Kalelkar Commission formed in the 1950s to provide reservation to Other Backward Classes (OBCs) and said the Congress did not implement its recommendations for years.""In 1980, (the then prime minister) Indira Gandhi put the Mandal Commission in cold storage.In 1990, when it was accepted, Rajiv Gandhi gave a two-and-a-half-hour speech and opposed OBC reservation,"" the Union minister said.""In Karnataka, the Congress snatched reservation for backward classes and gave it to Muslims. The same will happen here if they come (to power) here,"" Shah said.""I want to assure you that we (BJP) will not allow Muslim reservation in Haryana. We will protect the rights of backward classes,"" he said.He asserted that the BJP would form the government in Haryana with a full majority.The Haryana Assembly elections are scheduled to be held later this year.When Narendra Modi became prime minister in 2014, he had said that his government was of Dalits, the poor and backward classes, said Shah.The BJP has given the country its first strong prime minister who comes from a backward class. Twenty-seven Union ministers are from backward classes including two from Haryana, the home minister said.Shah said the Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini-led Haryana government recently took three important decisions for backward classes, including increasing the annual income limit for the creamy layer of Other Backward Classes (OBCs) from Rs 6 lakh to Rs 8 lakh. Salary and agricultural income are excluded from the ambit.Shah said earlier, in panchayats, there was 8 per cent reservation for backward classes in 'Group A'. Now, in addition to this, 5 per cent reservation will be provided in 'Group B'. In municipal bodies as well, 5 per cent reservation will be introduced for 'Group B' while the 8 per cent will remain intact, he said.Shah said these pro-people decisions are in line with Prime Minister Modi's policies of public welfare.According to an official statement, previously, there was a provision of 8 per cent reservation for the BC-A category in Panchayati Raj institutions. Now, an additional 5 per cent reservation will be provided for the BC-B category.Similarly, there is an existing provision of 8 per cent reservation for the BC-A category in urban local bodies. Now, a 5 per cent reservation will be provided for the BC-B category.In Haryana, BC-A and BC-B are sub-categories of backward classes.Shah praised Saini, also an OBC, for his simplicity and said his doors are always open for people.Saini, Union ministers Rao Inderjit Singh, Krishan Pal Gurjar and Dharmendra Pradhan, and many Haryana ministers were also present on the occasion.Targeting senior Congress leader and former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda over the Congress' 'Haryana Maange Hisab' campaign, Shah said, ""Hooda sahab, you have to give an account of 10 years of misgovernance and depriving Haryana of development.""""I am the son of a Baniya, I have come with an account every single penny,"" he said.""You give an account of corruption in jobs, spreading casteism, injustice with the downtrodden and nepotism.""What account do you want? We will give you an account of things and the people of Haryana will seek an account from the Congress,"" he said.The Congress on Monday launched the 'Haryana Maange Hisab' campaign, under which it will target the ruling BJP on several fronts, including unemployment and law and order, ahead of the assembly polls.Shah said the Congress governments in Haryana and at the Centre gave only Rs 41,000 crore for development projects to the state between 2004 and 2014 while the BJP's double-engine government has given Rs 2.59 lakh crore.The minister said that while there was ""ease of corruption"" during the Congress rule, there was ""ease of business"" under the BJP government.Today, Shah said, Haryana is the largest exporter of basmati rice in the country, every 10th jawan in the Army comes from the state and maximum crops are purchased by the state government at minimum support price (MSP).He called on people, including BJP workers, to seek an account of how much money was spent on development works during the 10-year tenure of the Congress.He said BJP workers will visit all 6,225 panchayats to present an account of the development work carried out by the BJP.Addressing the gathering, Chief Minister Saini said the central government has not only worked to secure the rights of backward classes but has also protected them.This was Shah's second visit to Haryana in less than a month. On June 29, he had addressed BJP leaders and workers during a meeting of the party's extended state executive in Panchkula.","Home Minister Amit Shah accuses Congress of being anti-backward classes.
