"'Trinamool trying to break Congress, listen to party workers ... ': Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury's strong message to Delhi leadership",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trinamool-trying-to-break-congress-listen-to-party-workers-adhir-ranjan-chowdhurys-strong-message-to-delhi-leadership/articleshow/112173153.cms,"NEW DELHI: Is Adir Ranjan Chouwdhury on his way out of the Congress? Well, we do not know for now, but the West Bengal Congess leader has surely dropped clear hints of rebellion amid imminent change of leadership in the state unit. The West Bengal Congress leader, who represented Behrampore Lok Sabha constituency for five terms, lost the 2024 Lok Sabha elections to cricketer-turned-politician Yusuf Pathan of the Trinamool Congress.He lost his stronghold of Baharampur by nearly 74,000 votes. Adhir, a staunch critic of ruling Trinamool Congress , resigned as the president of the West Bengal unit after the Lok Sabha elections.In a strongly-worded post on social media, Adhir attacked the Congress high command for reportedly asking the state unit to go soft on Mamata Banerjee 's Trinamool Congress.""Who else other than us will speak on behalf of our party workers who are being beaten up every day by the ruling Trinamool Congress activists in West Bengal? The ruling party in the state is trying to break Congress on a daily basis. Despite officially being a part of the INDIA bloc, they have not stopped oppressing us,” the West Bengal Congress leader said in his post.Asserting that the rank and file of the party at the grassroots is against any tie-up with Trinamool, Adhir said, ""Delhi needs to speak to those party workers in West Bengal who are struggling daily and protesting on the streets to keep the party flag. Their opinion is important and hence they should also be called to Delhi.""""I will be there on the streets with my party colleagues and carry forward their movement. I will not compromise with injustice. I will never do that,"" Adhir added.Adhir has been vocal about his opposition to Trinamool Congress and has openly targeted the West Bengal chief minister, mcuh to the discomfort of the party's high command.A latest example of this was seen when the Congress expressed solidarity with TMC chief Mamata Banerjee over the developments at the NITI Aayog meeting, while on the same day, Chowdhury wrote a letter to President Droupadi Murmu, alleging that West Bengal is in an ""anarchic condition"" and sought her intervention to ""restore law and order"" in the state.In fact, Adhir was instrumental in ensuring that the Congress did not align with the Trinamool in the last Lok Sabha and also assembly elections. However, Congress bid to contest these two elections in alliance with the Left Front failed to make any impact as the party failed to open its account in either of the two elections.After losing his seat and the grand old party's drubbing in Lok Sabha elections in the state, Adhir has been isolated within the Congress, with the high command gradually distancing itself from his acerbic attacks on Mamata. The West Bengal chief minister, on her part, has often accused Adhir of working as an agent of the BJP.Dropping hints at the widening gap with the party leadership, Adhir recently claimed that he got to know during a meeting that he was no longer the state Congress chief. ""I was aware that a meeting had been called under my presidency and I was still the West Bengal Congress president but during the meeting, Ghulam Ali Mir while addressing said that the former president is also here. At that time, I got to know I had become former president (of West Bengal Congress),"" Adhir said.The Congress is in the process of carrying out changes in the West Bengal unit. Congress general secretary, organisation, K C Venugopal recently held a meeting with senior party leaders from the state and discussed several issues, including ties with the ruling Trinamool Congress. The meeting was attended by Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury , general secretary AICC in-charge West Bengal Ghulam Ahmad Mir and Pradip Bhattacharya, among others.Meanwhile, in an interesting twist, Union minister and Republican Party of India (A) leader Ramdas Athavale has extended Adhir an invite to join the NDA.""I request Adhir Ranjan ji that if he is being insulted in Congress, then he should leave Congress. I invite him to join NDA or my party RPI,"" Athavale said. ""It is because he (Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury) lost from West Bengal that he is being ignored and insulted. Due to this attitude of Congress, many people left the party and joined BJP,"" the Union minister added.Clearly, the road ahead for Adhir within the Congress appears to be bumpy. Assembly elections in West Bengal is due in 2026. If the Congress decides to join hands with Mamata, it may lose Adhir and also its alliance with the Left in the state. But that should not be a problem for the grand old party as already they are political rivals in Kerala despite being part of INDIA bloc at the national level.","Adhir Ranjan Chouwdhury lost the 2024 Lok Sabha elections to cricketer-turned- politician Yusuf Pathan.

"Congress moves privilege notice against PM Modi, BJP calls it a joke",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-moves-privilege-notice-against-pm-modi-bjp-calls-it-a-joke/articleshow/112178383.cms,"‘Cong complaint against PM may not pass muster’



NEW DELHI: Even as Congress on Wednesday filed a notice of breach of privilege against PM Modi for tweeting BJP MP Anurag Thakur 's speech with content that had allegedly been expunged, there was little likelihood of the move making any headway, report Akhilesh Singh & Subodh Ghildiyal. Congress notice submitted by Charanjit Singh Channi , ex-CM and a Dalit, claimed PM Modi had shared expunged parts of Thakur's speech.A BJP functionary called the Congress move a ""joke"".A Congress notice said PM Modi had praised Anurag Thakur’s speech that “disparaged the SC/ST/OBC communities for their demand of caste census”. If the notice is accepted by the Speaker, the privilege motion under Rule 222 of the Rules of Procedure would be moved against the PM.Congress submitted records of proceedings and Modi’s tweet of Thakur’s video in which the PM said the “speech by my young and energetic colleague Anurag Thakur is a must hear. A perfect mix of facts and humour, exposing the dirty politics of the INDI Alliance”.Sources in LS Secretariat, however, said that the complaint is unlikely to pass muster. “Congress members’ primary grouse against Thakur’s speech was to his remarks where talked about the lack of clarity about the caste of the leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi. However, that part was not expunged since the BJP MP did not name anyone,” said a source familiar with the procedures.“If Congress’ notice of privilege motion is based on this part of the former Union minister’s speech, it cannot be deemed valid as that portion was never expunged,” said another source even though he said that the final decision on the matter will be that of Speaker Om Birla.Sources said that the only bit in Thakur’s speech which was expunged was his use of the word “lie”, twice, an unparliamentary expression. Amid Congress’ protests, presiding officer Jagdambika Pal, told Thakur that he could not use “lie” and suggested using “falsehood” instead. Thakur heeded the suggestion. “It does not warrant a privilege motion,” said sources in LS secretariat even as they reiterated that Birla will form an opinion after talking to Channi.“It is ironical that those whose own caste is not known are going around demanding caste census?” BJP MP had saidBJP was combative in response to Congress’s move and said there is a history of Congress MPs, including Rahul Gandhi, sharing video links of speeches of which large portions were expunged. Congress’ notice is nothing but politics, they claimed. “Congress functionaries should have done homework before taking such a move, which sounds like a joke as the parts of Thakur’s remarks, about which the party has mentioned, have not been expunged from the proceedings,” a senior BJP functionary said.In the notice, Channi said, “The PM’s tweeting of remarks which had been expunged from the proceedings of LS clearly amounts to a breach of privilege and contempt of the house.” He urged the Speaker to allow his notice to move the motion. Thakur’s speech on Tuesday triggered a furore as his remark about Rahul’s caste, albeit without naming, provoked a reply from the leader of opposition.","Congress filed a notice of breach of privilege against PM Modi for tweeting BJP MP Anurag Thakur's speech with content that had allegedly been expunged.
