'How 450 helipads were constructed to land Naveen Patnaik aide VK Pandian's chopper',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/450-helipads-for-naveen-aide-under-scanner/articleshow/112449927.cms,"BHUBANESWAR: Days after Odisha commerce and transport minister Bibhuti Bhusan Jena called for a thorough probe into V K Pandian ’s helicopter rides, state law minister Prithiviraj Harichandan on Sunday said the govt will investigate how 450 helipads were constructed to land the chopper carrying the bureaucrat-turned-politician.Pandian, a close aide of former chief minister Naveen Patnaik, took helicopter rides between Feb and Sept last year during BJD govt to interact with the public and gather feedback.“We will investigate who covered the cost of the helicopter rides. Clarity must be provided on this matter. It needs a thorough probe. At the govt level, helipads were constructed wherever the helicopter landed, and govt funds were used. He (Pandian) visited 400-450 places. It is not clear who authorized this and how the authorization was issued. A department secretary does not have the authority to use helicopters. How, then, was permission granted?” asked Harichandan. Pandian was the 5T secretary at the time.Harichandan, also the works minister, added that BJP govt will include everything in the investigation. “After the investigation is complete, we will consider the appropriate punishment,” he told reporters.Odisha Soochana Adhikar Abhijan, a group of RTI activists, staged a demonstration on July 24, alleging misuse of helicopters and chartered flights by Pandian, who took voluntary retirement from IAS in October and joined BJD the following month. He campaigned extensively for the party in Lok Sabha and assembly elections.In response to the ministers’ calls for an investigation into the helicopter rides, BJD functionary Sambit Routray said, “BJP and Congress functionaries should focus on whether there has been development across the state. Why are they concerned with who rode what?”Pandian took helicopter rides between Feb and Sept last year, when BJD was in office, to interact with the public. ‘We will probe who covered the cost of the rides,’ Odisha minister Harichandan said.","Odisha commerce and transport minister Bibhuti Bhusan Jena called for a thorough probe into V K Pandian ’s helicopter rides.

Natwar: From Congress’ ‘charmed circle’ to persona non grata,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/natwar-from-congress-charmed-circle-to-persona-non-grata/articleshow/112450066.cms,"NEW DELHI:

He could have been anything and he did become everything. A royal who wore many hats and a diplomat who was witty and also excelled at arts and letters. A politician who had the free pass as someone “close” to four generations of the Gandhi family , starting with Nehru. Natwar Singh achieved so much and more, that his death could have been a glowing celebration across partisan lines.But when Singh did depart at the ripe age of 93, he was remembered as a bitter man who had a sad falling out with the Gandhi family, with a cloud of corruption over his head, and his counter charges against Congress and its leadership. And, as a man who shook hands with “communal forces” out of personal pique.Singh’s journey from Congress towards BJP dominated his obituaries, when the man could have been toasted just for the breadth of his experiences, nicely compressed in his book ‘Profiles and Letters’ about his elite acquaintances, that included EM Forster and Rajagopalachari.Singh was a member of the Congress’s “charmed circle”, since he joined politics and became an MP and minister in 1984, after a rich life as diplomat of IFS who had served key postings in China, the US, Pakistan and the UK. He was close to Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi, and then to Sonia Gandhi. But the dominant and defining chapter of his life came with the Volcker Report and the allegations about his having benefitted from ‘Oil for Food’ programme of the UN by using his acquaintance with then Iraqi strongman Saddam Hussein. That sparked a furore under the initial days of the UPA govt led by Manmohan Singh. Interestingly, the timing of the case in 2001 was when Congress was in the opposition and Singh was the head of the party’s foreign affairs cell.Aniel Matherani, who in 2005 was ambassador to Croatia, and two other Congressmen were said to have gone to Iraq as part of the party delegation. Matherani laid the blame on Singh, and “corroborated” the allegations that the veteran had laid the ground for benefitting his son and son’s friend. Singh contested the claims and pointed out that Congress too was named in the annexures of the Volcker report.Singh left the govt and the party, and quickly turned into a paraiah. The Justice RS Pathak Committee was, as was reported, said to have fixed the responsibility with Singh. He always countered the view and insisted that he had been exonerated, as per his interviews and press reports.From charmed circle to persona non grata, Singh lived his later years with bitterness, his comments about Sonia Gandhi, and even barbs at other members of the family betraying his peeve.On Sunday, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge paid tributes to Singh, writing on X: “Our deepest condolences on the passing away of Former Union minister K Natwar Singh. An acclaimed intellectual and a Padma Bhushan recipient, he made a profound contribution to India’s diplomacy and external affairs. Our thoughts are with his family, friends and followers.”Praising his personality and achievements, Jairam Ramesh said, “He was truly someone who has left behind his ‘footprints on the sands of time’.”","Natwar Singh achieved so much and more, that his death could have been a glowing celebration across partisan lines.

Chirag Paswan reaching out to SC MPs as his party seeks review of apex court's reservation verdict,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/chirag-paswan-reaching-out-to-sc-mps-as-his-party-seeks-review-of-apex-courts-reservation-verdict/articleshow/112444913.cms,"NEW DELHI: Union minister and LJP (Ram Vilas) leader Chirag Paswan is planning to convene a meeting of Scheduled Caste MPs of different parties as he works to mobilise support ahead of his party filing a review plea in the Supreme Court against its judgment allowing sub-categorisation of reservation within the community. The Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) leader has already expressed his disagreement with the verdict and said his party will file a review petition in the apex court .Paswan, sources said, has reached out to Scheduled Caste MPs to gauge their view over the verdict, a judgment of far-reaching political impact over which major national parties have maintained silence while engaging in internal stock-taking deliberations, and may convene a formal meeting soon.It remains to be seen, though, what the response of the Scheduled Caste MPs of different parties will be, many of whom have spoken in different voices depending on the mood of their constituencies.The parties like Paswan's or Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), which draw support from numerically strong SC communities which fare better than other Dalit castes on social and economic metrics, have come out openly against the judgment.However, another Dalit ally of the BJP and Union Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi has lauded the verdict, saying that his community of Manjhis are ""grossly under-represented"" in the benefits brought by quota as better-off SC communities corner most of the positions in jobs and educational institutes on offer.The critics of the verdict have argued that a chunk of vacancies reserved for the SCs often remain open due to a lack of adequately qualified applicants, saying introducing sub-quotas for different castes within the larger quota will only worsen the problem.Both the ruling BJP and the main opposition Congress have not taken a categorical stand on the issue, leaving it to their state leaders to frame their responses based on regional sensibilities.A seven-judge Constitution bench headed by Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud had ruled on August 1 by a 6:1 majority that the further sub-classification of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes by the states can be permitted to ensure grant of quota to more backward castes inside these groups.",Chirag Paswan is planning to convene a meeting of Scheduled Caste MPs of different parties.
