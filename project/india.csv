Gujarat high court upholds judge's dismissal for 'unsuitability',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gujarat-high-court-upholds-judges-dismissal-for-unsuitability/articleshow/112596458.cms,"AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Tuesday dismissed a petition filed by a judge removed from service for 'unsuitability'. Besides the matter of her unsuitability for service, which was the grounds for her termination , the judge was also suspected of having forged the resignation letters of two other judges. However, the HC order did not mention this as a cause of any action against her.She failed to secure anticipatory bail from the higher courts for the alleged forgery .This case involved a civil judge (junior division), Mayuri Panchal, who was inducted in 2013 with a two-year probation period. Her probation was extended till March 2022, when an order simpliciter was issued for the termination of her services, stating that her performance was not satisfactory. During the extended probation period, a departmental inquiry against her over her conduct took place in 2017, but the HC decided not to act against her and her probation was extended further.In 2021, when she was posted at the court in Limbdi in Surendranagar district, the principal district judge received the resignation letters of two judges, who denied having written them. Two FIRs for forgery were lodged and a police investigation pointed to Panchal's involvement. In Dec 2022, she approached the HC for anticipatory bail, claiming that since she had ""issued notices against the collector, range IG, superintendent of police and police inspector, it had resulted in vindictive action against her"".Her anticipatory bail plea was rejected by the HC on the grounds that she should have approached a sessions court in Surendranagar district, which she said would be biased. She approached the Supreme Court but finally withdrew her pleas in May.Meanwhile, in March 2022, Panchal was asked to leave. She challenged her dismissal before the HC with her advocate asserting that the dismissal was based on her unsatisfactory performance till 2018, whereas her performance had improved after 2018. She continued to oppose her sacking as 'stigmatic' because it came after a departmental inquiry.However, the bench of Chief Justice Sunita Agarwal and Justice Aniruddha Mayee turned down the petition, observing that her termination order does not indict her for any misconduct. Merely an inquiry against her on the principal district judge's report doesn't change the nature of the order of termination simpliciter into that of punishment because the HC's standing committee had not taken any action or formed any opinion on the inquiry report.While the issue of forging the resignation letters was discussed during the hearing of Panchal's petition, the HC order does not mention it as a cause of any action against her.","Mayuri Panchal was inducted in 2013 with a two-year probation period.

BENGALURU: Karnataka governor Thaawar Chand Gehlot granted sanction Saturday for the prosecution of CM Siddaramaiah in connection with the alleged Mysore Urban Development Authority (Muda) land allotment scam. The decision led to immediate calls from opposition BJP and JD(S) for Siddaramaiah's resignation on moral grounds.The cabinet convened Saturday evening and pledged to challenge the decision legally and politically.Siddaramaiah declared that ""he (the governor) has no authority, jurisdiction, it is totally unconstitutional"", adding that he would ""fight it out in the court of law"". Siddaramaiah dismissed demands for his resignation, calling the governor's sanction ""anti-constitutional and against law.""The governor's sanction, issued under Section 17A of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, and Section 218 of Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023, followed petitions from three activists - Pradeep Kumar SP, TJ Abraham, and Snehamayi Krishna.The CM has consistently denied allegations that Muda illegally allotted land to his wife Parvathi.Governor's sanction, issued under Section 17A of Prevention of Corruption Act, and Section 218 of Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, followed petitions from three activists - Pradeep Kumar SP, TJ Abraham, and Snehamayi Krishna.CM Siddaramaiah has denied allegations that Muda illegally allotted land to his wife Parvathi. According to opposition BJP, Muda allocated Parvathi 14 sites totalling 38,284 sq-ft in an upscale Mysuru locality as compensation for land in Kesare village. BJP has termed it a Rs 4,000-crore scam, which Siddaramaiah denied, asserting that the land in question was gifted to his wife by her brother.""It is a big conspiracy to dislodge an elected govt. They (BJP) have done this in several states, including Delhi and Jharkhand. Cente, BJP, JDS, and others are involved in this conspiracy,"" Siddaramaiah claimed, accusing opposition of using Raj Bhavan as a political tool.Governor Thaawar Chand Gehlot justified his action and emphasised the necessity of a neutral and non-partisan investigation. He said allegations, along with supporting materials, indicated commission of offences. The petitioners are expected to approach court next week. Abraham, one of the complainants, said: ""We will request the judge to take cognisance of it or refer it under Section 156(3) of CrPC. I will do it Wednesday.""Pradeep Kumar has filed a caveat in Karnataka HC to ensure that the court hears the arguments of the original complainant first before reaching any conclusion. ""Without a caveat, he (Siddaramaiah) might get court relief,"" Pradeep said. Governor's sanction followed a show-cause notice issued to Siddaramaiah on July 26, directing him to respond to the allegations within seven days. Instead of replying to the charges, Siddaramaiah allowed his council of ministers to pass a resolution condemning the notice and seeking its dismissal.BJP and JDS had staged a padayatra from Bengaluru to Mysuru, demanding Siddaramaiah's resignation over the alleged scam.",Karnataka governor Thaawar Chand Gehlot granted sanction for prosecution of CM Siddaramaiah.

"PDP, NC positive reactions to J&K polls signal shift in stand",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pdp-nc-positive-reactions-to-jk-polls-signal-shift-in-stand/articleshow/112595803.cms,"(inputs from Sanjay Khajuria in Jammu)

SRINAGAR: Election Commission’s announcement to hold assembly elections in J&K after a decade-long gap has sparked optimism, with parties such as Mehbooba Mufti ’s People’s Democratic Party ( PDP ) and Farooq Abdullah’s National Conference ( NC ) showing signs of a potential shift in their stand on participating in the electoral process.Until recently, both former CM Mehbooba and NC’s Omar Abdullah had maintained firm positions, stating they would not participate in any elections until J&K’s statehood, stripped after the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019, was restored.However, EC's announcement of elections in three phases from Sept 18 to Oct 1 appears to have altered the political landscape.PDP insiders suggested that Mehbooba is also likely to reconsider her decision to stay away from the elections, as pressure mounts from her party cadre urging her to participate.For his part, NC president Farooq Abdullah asked the party cadre to gear up for the polls, emphasising the need to strengthen its grassroots base. “We are committed to overall development of J&K,” he said Saturday in Jammu, while welcoming J&K BJP’s OBC wing general secretary and others into the NC fold.His son Omar had posted an image of his inked index finger on X, captioned: “The indelible ink mark from the recent elections hasn’t gone & we are back in election mode. Bring it on! We are ready!”Speaking to the media, Omar acknowledged the immense pressure from within his party to join the electoral race, citing concerns about the health of his father Farooq, who continues to lead NC despite advancing age and health challenges. “If I choose not to contest the assembly elections, there is a concern that he might be compelled to contest,” he said.Despite the presence of over 40 political parties in J&K, including Ghulam Nabi Azad’s Democratic Progressive Azad Party (DPAP), many of these parties lack the organisational strength and visibility of PDP and NC, making the upcoming elections a critical battleground for the region’s dominant players.During the recent Lok Sabha polls, BJP had asked Kashmiris to vote for any candidate other than the ‘dynastic troika’ of NC, PDP and Congress. However, the results were surprising. BJP retained two seats in Jammu but failed in Kashmir and Ladakh. Omar lost to jailed independent candidate Engineer Rashid and Mufti to NC’s Mian Altaf, but Farooq Abdullah’s party still won two of the three LS seats in Kashmir."," EC's announcement of elections in three phases from Sept 18 to Oct 1 appears to have altered the political landscape.

""NC and PDP had come together and walk together as People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration. There were claims that north and south poles had joined hands for the people's cause. But when the cause of the people came during Lok Sabha elections, they parted ways. Congress strongly believes the three parties should fight together,"" he told TOI. He warned, ""If they want to fight alone and decide accordingly, it will be their decision. But people will be the judge.""Mir said people did not like the decision of NC and PDP to fight Lok Sabha polls separately, and defeated both Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah.Sections of Congress are concerned about BJP's attempts to corral smaller parties like Apni Party and independents in a ""tactical pact"", and believe it could dent the opposition if PDP and NC fight separately.","Congress general secretary Ghulam Ahmad Mir said NC and PDP should stand true to their earlier stance that the cause of the state is above personal issues.

If anyone has the courage, they should declare their CM face,"" he added.Earlier, speaking at a meeting of the Maha Vikas Aghadi on Friday, Thackeray insisted that the Opposition alliance decide its chief ministerial face first rather than relying on the principle that the chief minister would be from the party which wins the largest number of seats. He would support any candidate decided by the Congress and NCP (SP).""First, decide (the CM's face) and then go ahead but do not go by this policy (those having the most seats will get the CM's post).

Because in the last elections, with the BJP in alliance with us, we experienced that to get the maximum number of MLAs, the allies themselves try to put other ally candidates down. So, I will not favour the party with the most number of MLAs getting the CM post,"" he added further.However, NCP (SP) supremo Sharad Pawar dodged the issue while Congress chief Nana Patole said the decision on the CM's post will be taken by the INDIA bloc leaders.Meanwhile, Shiv Sena (Eknath Shinde) MP took a swipe at Uddhav Thackeray's stance and claimed that Congress will never support him for CM's post.""I knew the Congress' style of functioning very well.

With their backing, Siddaramaiah is likely to dismiss opposition's calls for his resignation. He could argue that similar situations in the past did not lead to the resignation of others.For instance, former CM BS Yediyurappa continued in office even after the then governor sanctioned his prosecution in connection with an alleged mining scam.
