High stakes for BJP in Uttarakhand

AAP eyes a comeback in Punjab

(With agency inputs)

NEW DELHI: Voting for the byelections in 13 Assembly seats across seven states commenced at 7 am on Wednesday. The counting of votes for these bypolls will take place on July 13.The fate of several veteran politicians and newcomers, including the wife of Himachal Pradesh chief minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu Kamlesh Thakur will be decided in the polls.These elections, the first since the Lok Sabha polls, will fill vacancies caused by deaths or resignations of sitting members in legislative assemblies. The constituencies going to bypolls include:In West Bengal, both the ruling TMC and the BJP have high stakes in the bypolls. The TMC aims to capitalize on its improved performance in the Lok Sabha elections, while the BJP seeks to leverage the significant leads it gained in the four constituencies during the parliamentary polls.The TMC won Maniktala in the 2021 West Bengal elections, while the BJP won Raiganj, Ranaghat Dakshin, and Bagda before the MLAs switched to the TMC. The TMC has fielded candidates with strong local connections, while the BJP has nominated prominent figures like the All India Football Federation president Kalyan Chaubey.Himachal Pradesh will witness bypolls in three assembly constituencies - Dehra, Hamirpur, and Nalagarh - after three independent legislators who supported the BJP in the Rajya Sabha polls resigned from the House. The BJP has fielded these former Independent MLAs from their respective seats after they joined the party. The Congress has nominated chief minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu's wife Kamlesh Thakur in Dehra, while former Independent MLAs face Congress candidates in Hamirpur and Nalagarh. The BJP gained leads in all three constituencies during the recent Lok Sabha polls.Uttarakhand's Manglaur constituency will see a three-way contest between the BSP, Congress, and BJP, with the BJP never having won the Muslim and Dalit-dominated seats. The Badrinath assembly bypoll will be a direct fight between the BJP's Rajendra Bhandari, who recently switched from the Congress, and Congress newcomer Lakhpat Singh Butola. Historically, the party in power has an advantage in Uttarakhand bypolls.The Jalandhar West assembly bypoll in Punjab is a crucial test for chief minister Bhagwant Mann and the AAP after their poor performance in the Lok Sabha polls. The multi-cornered fight features candidates from the AAP, Congress, and BJP, with Mann actively campaigning for the AAP candidate. The BJP also aims to secure a victory after failing to win any seats in the recent Lok Sabha elections.","Voting for the byelections in 13 Assembly seats across seven states commenced at 7 am on Wednesday.

NEW DELHI: Hours after the arrest of Shiv Sena leader Rajesh Shah's son Mihir Shah, who mowed down a woman under his BMW, the victim's husband slammed the Maharashtra government and questioned the timing of the man's arrest claiming his blood would now not have any trace of alcohol three days after the incident.""He was arrested after three days, what does this mean? If he wasn't alcoholic , if he hadn't taken drugs, then why did he go into hiding?...why was he absconding for three days?

He is a big person who can buy anyone...who is there on our side? Did Fadnavis or Shinde come to our house to know what happened? Did Ajit Pawar come?

The claim is that the accused reversed the car...had he reversed the car, wouldn't she have survived?According to police, Kaveri Nakhwa was dragged for around 1.5 km by the speeding car before Mihir pulled it over, swapped the seat with his driver, and fled in another vehicle.Nakhwa said today he (Mihir) went to jail, day after tomorrow he will be produced in court and subsequently everything will cool down paving the way for his bail.""We are poor, who will give justice to us?

In his first speech in Parliament as leader of the opposition, the Congress leader accused BJP leaders of dividing people along communal lines during the debate on the Motion of Thanks for the President's address.In response, Prime Minister Narendra Modi claimed that Gandhi had referred to the ""entire Hindu community as violent."" To this, Rahul Gandhi replied, “Narendra Modi ji is not the entire Hindu community, the BJP is not the entire Hindu community, the RSS is not the entire Hindu community”.Swami Avimukteshwarananda, in a now-viral video, asserted that Gandhi's speech did not contradict Hinduism , stating, ""We heard Rahul Gandhi's entire speech. He is clearly saying that there is no place for violence in Hinduism."" ""I saw his entire video and found out that he had not said anything wrong,"" Swami Avimukteshwarananda replied when a journalist sought his views on Rahul's remarks in Parliament.Prashant Bhushan, senior lawyer and activist, posted the video on X, and said, ""Shankaracharya pointing out that Rahul didn’t say anything against Hindu religion. The channels & BJP IT cell spreading disinformation against him should be prosecuted.""The Shankaracharya also pointed out that spreading only a part of Gandhi's statement was incorrect and called for the punishment of those responsible for doing so. “Spreading half-truths by editing speeches is a crime, and such people should be punished, whether they are from a newspaper or a channel … Later, Rahul Gandhi clarified that his statement was directed at the party led by the Centre, alleging that they are promoting violence under the guise of religion,” the Shankaracharya added.Priyanka Gandhi, Congress MP, also defended her brother, saying, ""My brother (Rahul) can never speak against Hindus. He has spoken about BJP and about BJP leaders.""The remarks by Rahul Gandhi had caused an uproar in the Lok Sabha, leading to several statements being struck off the record by the Speaker.","Swami Avimukteshwarananda, the 46th Shankaracharya of Jyotir Math in Uttarakhand, came out in support of Rahul Gandhi's comments in Lok Sabha.

NEW DELHI: The Congress has continued with its offensive against Prime Minister Narendra Modi's reply to the Motion of Thanks on the President's address in Parliament last week. The grand old party has now sought breach of privilege proceedings against the Prime Minister in Rajya Sabha for allegedly making ""derogatory"" remarks against Hamid Ansari , former chairman of the Upper House.""I wish to bring to your notice a serious incident of breach of privilege and contempt of the House on the part of the Prime Minister of India. On July 2, 2024, prime minister while replying to the discussion on the Motion of Thanks on the President's Address in Lok Sabha inter alia stated: 'No matter how many numbers they claim, when we came in 2014, our strength in the Rajya Sabha was very low, and the Chair's inclination was somewhat on the other side',"" Congress leader Jairam Ramesh has written in a letter to Rajya Sabha chairman Jagdeep Dhankar .On Saturday, the Congress had accused PM Modi of breaking all parliamentary norms by accusing the then Rajya Sabha chairman Hamid Ansari of having an ""inclination"" towards the opposition when the BJP came to power in 2014.In his reply to the Motion of Thanks on the President's address on July 2, PM Modi had said, ""No matter how many numbers they claim, when we came in 2014, our strength in the Rajya Sabha was very low, and the Chair's inclination was somewhat on the other side. But we did not waver from our resolve to serve the country with pride. I want to tell the people of the country that the decision you have made, the order you have given us to serve, neither Modi nor this government will be afraid of any such obstacles. We will fulfill the resolutions we have set out to achieve.""While the Prime Minister did not name anyone, former Vice-President Ansari was the chairman of Rajya Sabha from August 2012 to August 2017.In his letter, dated July 8, to the Rajya Sabha chairman, Jairam Ramesh wrote: ""The accusation attributed to Dr. Hamid Ansari of 'leaning' towards the Opposition made by the prime minister is wholly unacceptable and grossly derogatory to say the least, apart from being completely false.""Incidentally, this is not the first time that the Prime Minister has targeted former Vice-President Ansari, Ramesh said in his letter and pointed out that on August 10, 2017, the Prime Minister in his farewell speech on Ansari's retirement in the Balayogi Auditorium had alluded to then retiring chairman's earlier diplomatic postings in a ""mischievous manner"".""No prime minister has ever attacked a former speaker of Lok Sabha or chairman of Rajya Sabha in the manner in which Shri Narendra Modi has done,"" the Congress leader alleged and added ""The prime minister has broken all parliamentary norms, decorum and, as a matter of fact, set a new low to the dignity of the very office of the Prime Minister of India.""""Such defamatory remarks made on the floor of Lok Sabha, attributing derogatory motives to the former Chairman of Rajva Sabha when he was not present to defend himself is tantamount to grave disregard and disrespect to the high office of the Chairman, Rajya Sabha, as well as to the Rajya Sabha itself. I, therefore, seek privilege proceedings against the prime minister in the matter,"" Ramesh said in his letter to Dhankhar.This is the second time that the Congress has targeted Prime Minister Modi over his reply to the Motion of Thanks on the President's address in Parliament.Earlier on June 4, Congress MP Manickam Tagore had written to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla to point out “factually incorrect, inaccurate and misleading statements” made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP MP Anurag Thakur in the House and sought appropriate action in the matter.The Congress MP said that Prime Minister Modi in his reply to the Motion of Thanks to the President's address had said that the Congress made a ""false promise"" of Rs 8,500 per month to women, when the party's promise was conditional to victory and government formation.He also challenged Prime Minister Modi's claim that the Congress vote share has gone down in 16 states in which it contested alone. ""This is factually incorrect. The Congress vote share increased in Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Karnataka, Telangana etc.,"" Tagore was quoted as saying in his letter to Om Birla.The Congress MP also termed as ""grossly misleading"" Modi's remarks that ""no bullet proof jackets [were provided] for the Army during the Congress' time"". ""There was a shortage of jackets, not that jackets were not there. Even police had bullet proof jackets like in Mumbai attacks,"" Tagore said.He also challenged the Prime Minister over the claim that the Congress didn't give fighter jets to the Army.(With inputs from agencies)","The Congress has continued with its offensive against Prime Minister Narendra Modi's reply to the Motion of Thanks on the President's address in Parliament last week.

Gujarati-origin woman scripts Tories’ only gain; Shivani Raja broke Labour’s grip on Leicester East,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/gujarati-origin-woman-scripts-tories-only-gain/articleshow/111560030.cms,"TOI

LONDON: There was a silver lining on an otherwise dark night for the Tories on Thursday. Gujarati-origin businesswoman Shivani Raja (29) won Leicester East -- the only Conservative gain of the night. Raja won with 14,526 votes, beating Labour ’s Rajesh Agrawal, former deputy mayor of London who came second with 10,100.Leicester East had been held by Labour since 1987.The area was rocked by riots in 2022, something Raja referred to after her triumph.Padma Shri awardee and Conservative MP Bob Blackman bucked the national trend and increased his majority in Harrow East from 8,170 to 11,860, beating his Indian-origin Labour opponent Primesh Patel. Harrow East has a large Indian diaspora, especially from Gujarat and south India. Many of them helped with Blackman’s campaign. Blackman now plans to throw his hat in the ring to be the chairman of the 1922 committee, the committee of backbench Tory MPs which organises the process to choose the next Conservative party leader.Raja was born in Leicester. Her mother moved to the UK from Rajkot and her father, a Gujarati, moved from Kenya in the 1970s. She works in the family property construction and hospitality business. Raja toldthat voters felt very disenfranchised and backed her as she was local, unlike some other candidates who had been “parachuted in”.“They had lost faith in politicians as previous MPs had not really stood for the people. There was no one standing that was relatable and people saw me as a breath of fresh air. They were also disappointed that the previous MP did not stand up for Leicester during the riots and immediately blamed Hindus before speaking to anyone,” Raja said.Keith Vaz first won Leicester East in 1987. Claudia Webbe, who won the seat in 2019 for Labour but then got expelled from the party over a criminal conviction and stood as an independent, got 5,532 votes. Vaz, who stood for One Leicester, got 3,681 votes.As for Blackman, he has the task cut for him. If elected as chairman of the 1922 committee, he will organise the leadership contest to replace Rishi Sunak, who bowed out as PM after last week’s election results.The panel’s former chairman, Graham Brady, stood down at this election. Blackman told the Daily Telegraph: “I’ve been around since 1992. I’ve been through all the seminal events with Theresa May, Boris, Liz Truss and the election of Rishi.” He said the Conservatives needed a “chairman with the authority to be able to get the party together to be able to hear every view.”Co-chair of Conservative Friends of India Ameet Jogia, a former No.10 political advisor and political aide to Lord Popat, failed to win Hendon by just 15 seats — the lowest margin in the country. He is now taking legal advice about launching a possible judicial review against Barnet council for not sending postal ballots to people on time.Had Jogia, a Harrow-born Girnari Soni whose parents moved to the UK from Tanzania, been elected, he would have become the first member of the Soni community in the House of Commons. Thousands of voters in 120 constituencies are thought to have been impacted by delayed and missing postal ballots. Jogia told The Telegraph he personally knows constituents would have voted for him but their postal votes never arrived. “In my case this would have made a difference.”","Gujarati-origin businesswoman Shivani Raja (29) won Leicester East -- the only Conservative gain of the night.
