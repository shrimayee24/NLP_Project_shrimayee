'Nothing new': Ambedkar's grandson reacts to Amit Shah's remarks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nothing-new-ambedkars-grandson-reacts-to-amit-shahs-remarks/articleshow/116456296.cms,"NEW DELHI: Babasaheb Ambedkar's grandson, Prakash Ambedkar , on Wednesday criticised Union home minister Amit Shah for his remarks on the architect of the Indian Constitution, describing them as reflective of the BJP 's ""same old mentality."" His comments came amidst an ongoing political row, with opposition parties demanding a resignation from Shah, accusing him of insulting BR Ambedkar .Speaking to reporters in Pune, Prakash Ambedkar, who heads the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA), alleged that Shah's remarks reveal the BJP's underlying disdain for Ambedkar’s contributions. ""Before the BJP came into existence, its forerunners Jan Sangh and RSS had opposed Babasaheb while the Constitution was being adopted,"" he said. He added, “There is nothing new in the statement. They are not able to execute their old plans. Not because of Congress, but because of Babasaheb Ambedkar and they will continue to sulk.”He also demanded Rs 1 crore compensation for the family of Somnath Suryawanshi, who died in judicial custody following violence in Parbhani city over the desecration of a Constitution replica.The controversy erupted after Shah, during a Rajya Sabha debate, remarked, ""It has become a fashion to repeatedly invoke Ambedkar’s name. If they had taken God’s name as often, they would have earned a place in heaven.""The comments sparked outrage, with several MPs from the INDIA bloc staging protests in Parliament and the Congress demanding a public apology. Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh shared a video snippet of Shah's remarks, accusing the BJP of belittling Ambedkar’s legacy.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, however, defended Shah, accusing the Congress of distorting his remarks. Modi claimed Shah’s comments exposed the Congress’ “anti-Ambedkar history,” alleging that the party had previously worked to undermine Ambedkar, including denying him the Bharat Ratna and opposing his electoral bids. ""Congress can try as they want, but people know the truth about their legacy,"" Modi stated.Congress leaders, including Rahul Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge, dismissed Modi's defence, accusing the BJP of systematically undermining Ambedkar’s ideology. “They are against the Constitution and Ambedkar’s vision,” Gandhi said, warning that the BJP’s actions are aimed at erasing Ambedkar’s contributions.","Babasaheb Ambedkar's grandson criticises Union home minister Amit Shah for his remarks on the architect of the Indian Constitution.

"6 months later, smooth ride for NDA, INDIA bloc in disarray",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/6-months-later-smooth-ride-for-nda-india-bloc-in-disarray/articleshow/116453655.cms,"NEW DELHI: Six months is a long time in politics, and it is evident during the current session of Parliament.While the INDIA bloc was mounting pressure on the BJP-headed govt in June after the saffron party bagged 240 seats and fell short of securing majority on its own, during the winter session it is seen to be in disarray over multiple issues, from EVMs to Adani and V D Savarkar.In contrast, the coordination among NDA partners has appeared rather smooth, particularly during the debate on Constitution with each ally, whether it is BJP or Shiv Sena (Shinde), acting in sync. Even on the one nation one election (ONOE) bills, BJP managed to get TDP to back the move, with Chandrababu Naidu arguing that it will not impact Andhra Pradesh, which has been having simultaneous LS and assembly elections since 2004. TDP and JD(U), both with Muslim constituents, have resisted taking the bait from ""secular"" parties to oppose the legislation.The strong chemistry may have to do with the improved arithmetic in states after BJP's emphatic victories in Haryana and Maharashtra.The poll setbacks seem to have severely hit Congress , which was celebrating its 99 seats in Lok Sabha, the best show in a decade, undermining its credentials to head an anti-BJP front: its sheet anchor, at minimum. After its loss in the two elections and underwhelming show in J&K and Jharkhand, allies are seeking to reframe the power equations, with TMC boss Mamata Banerjee stepping up to grab the mantle and,getting the support of satraps such as Sharad Pawar and Lalu Prasad to head the bloc. Samajwadi Party too flexed its muscles in UP by-polls and has now decided to support Arvind Kejriwal, who is being challenged by Congress. Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday demanded Bharat Ratna for Hindutva ideologue and freedom fighter Savarkar. The effort to reclaim his Hindutva credentials is diametrically opposite to Rahul Gandhi's consistent campaign against Savarkar.The next challenge will be the polls for the cash-rich Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation where Uddhav and Rahul may struggle to reconcile their differences over a range of issues - from Savarkar to Ram Congresss's reaction to criticism of the restive allies: lashing out at Omar Abdullah or mocking Mamata's ambition as a cruel joke, has not helped matters. Congress has found itself at odds with allies on issues such as the Adani controversy, with TMC and SP breaking ranks with it.","The coordination among NDA partners has appeared rather smooth, particularly during the debate on Constitution.

The order was passed by Justice Ashutosh Srivastava.Earlier, appearing for Sushil, the counsel for the applicant questioned the authenticity of the suicide note left by Atul Subhash. He also added that the family court judge, before whom the matter of Atul Subhash and his wife Nikita Singhania was pending, was 'spared' despite being named in the suicide note.In response to this, the government's advocate submitted that the high court had on the administrative side taken note of the matter and it had summoned case records.Before the court, the accused limited the relief to a grant of transit anticipatory bail until January 2, the day when the courts in Karnataka will reopen after the winter break. The single judge is likely to pass an order later.On the other hand, the counsel appearing for the complainant argued that there is a specific allegation against the uncle (applicant-accused), as the alleged suicide video says that he was harassing the deceased for extorting money.","The Allahabad high court granted (transit) anticipatory bail to Sushil Singhania, the uncle of the widow of 34-year-old Bengaluru techie Atul Subhash.

BJP MLC Ram Shinde’s filing of nomination is being seen as a setback for Shinde-led Sena, which was seeking the legislative council chairperson’s post. (PTI)

NAGPUR: BJP MLC Ram Shinde filed his nomination for the election to the chairperson of the legislative council on Wednesday. While chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and deputy CM Ajit Pawar accompanied Ram Shinde, deputy CM Eknath Shinde didn't join them.Ram's nomination is being seen as a setback for Shiv Sena led by Eknath, which was seeking the council chairperson's post. Sena's Neelam Gorhe, who is currently deputy chairperson, was said to be in the race.Ram said, "" Congress also said that it will not be filing any nominations, so this election will be unopposed. That has sent a good message. I thank CM Fadnavis and the deputy CMs. Some discussion could have happened at the senior level between BJP and Sena.""Elections to the prestigious post were not held as Shiv Sena and NCP were split in 2022 and 2023 respectively. BJP has a majority in the council, but Sena was keen to get the post since BJP has the speaker's post in the legislative assembly. Now BJP will have presiding officers in both Houses of the legislature.Party sources said BJP has picked Ram for the post as he is from the Dhangar community. He was MLA from Karjat-Jamkhed but was defeated by NCP's (SP) Rohit Pawar in 2019 and in 2024.In July, Maha Vikas Aghadi's MLAs and MLCs led by leader of opposition in the legislative council Ambadas Danve had met then governor Ramesh Bais and urged him to direct that the election to the council's chairperson be held during the monsoon session. However, the election was not held then.A BJP functionary said, ""Ram lost the assembly polls in 2019 and was made an MLC, but he also lost the 2024 assembly polls. However, so far neither he nor MLA Gopichand Padalkar, who is also from the Dhangar community, have been made ministers in the new govt. So the party is nominating Ram for the chairperson's post. BJP is the largest party in the council and Ram's election will be easy and most likely unopposed.""","BJP MLC Ram Shinde filed his nomination for the election to the chairperson of the legislative council on Wednesday.

The home minister launched a veiled attack on Congress leader Rahul Gandhi. He also slammed Congress for finding faults in the election whenever they lose.After Shah's statement, Congress sought Shah's apology and said that the PM should sack the home minister from his cabinet for insulting BR Ambedkar and also to stop the people from protesting.""Our demand is that Amit Shah should apologise and if PM Modi has faith in Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar then he should be sacked by midnight... He has no right to remain in the cabinet, he should be sacked only then people will remain silent, otherwise, people will protest.

Uproar over Ambedkar stalls both Houses, TMC moves privilege notice against Shah

NEW DELHI: The opposition on Wednesday opened a new front against the Centre over home minister Amit Shah's alleged insult of B R Ambedkar. It held noisy protests in Parliament, leading to both Houses being adjourned and drawing a sharp retaliation from govt MPs.Leading the counter-offensive, PM Modi dismissed opposition's demand for Shah's resignation as ""theatrics"" and asserted that the rival party and its ""rotten ecosystem"" were spreading ""falsehoods"" because the home minister had exposed its misdeeds towards the Dalit icon. Shah accused Congress of circulating a ""doctored"" version of his Rajya Sabha speech and said BJP was exploring all legal options in response. ""The party is serious about it,"" he said at a press conference, emphasising that he belonged to a party which would never insult Ambedkar.Shah also reminded everyone that Ambedkar had to quit the first cabinet led by J L Nehru due to his disagreement with then Cong-led govt's policies, including Art 370. Shah also said most of the memorials of Ambedkar were built when BJP came to office. However, opposition's attack on Shah remained unrelenting with Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge saying it was India's misfortune that a Dalit icon was mocked by the HM. The intent to target Shah & BJP was evident when TMC's Derek O'Brien filed a privilege notice against him in RS.Both Houses of Parliament were adjourned without transacting any business on Wednesday due to noisy protests with Congress members seeking an apology from home minister Amit Shah for allegedly making disparaging remarks against B R Ambedkar.In Rajya Sabha, Trinamool Congress's Derek O'Brien submitted a privilege notice against Shah under Rule 187.The notice quoted the home minister's statement in the Upper House on Tuesday during his reply to a debate on 75 years of the Constitution. TMC also demanded an unconditional apology from Shah in Parliament.As soon as Lok Sabha proceedings began, Congress members Manickam Tagore and Hibi Eden led the sloganeering over Shah's remarks and trooped into the well, displaying posters of Ambedkar and raising slogans of 'Jai Bhim'. When BJP members opened the House post-adjournment with chants of 'Jai Shri Ram', the opposition replied in unison with ""Jai Bhim"". Members of opposition parties stood at their seats in support of Congress. Some members of the INDIA bloc were also in the well. Leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi was present in the House along with his sibling and Wayanad MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.Law minister Arjun Ram Meghwal sought to counter Congress, saying the party had always insulted Ambedkar and ensured his defeat in a Lok Sabha election. It resulted in further sloganeering.In Rajya Sabha, parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju and leader of the House J P Nadda strongly defended Shah's references to Ambedkar after leader of opposition Mallikarjun Kharge sought an apology from the home minister for ""insulting"" the Dalit icon.They said the remarks were being projected by Congress in a distorted way and were clearly ""an expression of our sense of reverence"" for Ambedkar. Rijiju and Nadda not only rubbished the opposition's ""insult"" charge, but also accused Congress of having insulted Ambedkar both in his lifetime and after.Responding to noisy protests in the morning, Rijiju said Congress had not bothered to honour Ambedkar with the Bharat Ratna, which was conferred on him in 1990 by a BJP-backed govt.""In 1952, Congress worked to ensure his defeat in Lok Sabha election; not only this, it was also responsible for Ambedkar's defeat in a Vidharbha bypoll later,"" he said. ""Baba Saheb (Ambedkar) would have been a member of Parliament (after 1952). By defeating him twice, you deceived the nation. You are pretending to speak up for Baba Saheb, but only using his name for political and electoral gains,"" Rijiju said. The charge was reiterated by Nadda in the post-recess sitting, who said Congress had repeatedly backstabbed Ambedkar.","Both Houses of Parliament were adjourned without transacting any business on Wednesday due to noisy protests.

From clamping of Emergency to using Constitution to reverse Supreme Court's Shah Bano judgment, all such past instances under the Congress regime were highlighted to target the grand-old-party and its leaders.However, a day after the end of debate, it was the turn of the Congress and other opposition parties to corner the BJP using Amit Shah's reference to B R Ambedkar.Congress general secretary-in-charge communications Jairam Ramesh shared a video snippet on X from Amit Shah's speech in the Upper House in which the Union home minister, taking a swipe at the opposition, had said: ""Abhi ek fashion ho gaya hai - Ambedkar, Ambedkar, Ambedkar, Ambedkar, Ambedkar, Ambedkar. Itna naam agar bhagwan ka lete to saat janmon tak swarg mil jata (It has become a fashion to say Ambedkar, Ambedkar, Ambedkar, Ambedkar, Ambedkar, Ambedkar'.

They claimed his remarks were an ""insult"" to the architect of India's Constitution B R Ambedkar. MPs of the opposition's INDIA bloc staged a protest outside Parliament demanding an apology from Amit Shah.Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge lashed out at Shah and said the “insult” of Babasaheb by the home minister “has once again proven that the BJP-RSS were against the tricolour, their forefathers opposed the Ashok Chakra and the people of the Sangh Parivar wanted to implement Manusmriti instead of the Constitution of India from the very first day”.""Babasaheb Dr Ambedkar Ji did not allow this to happen, that is why there is so much hatred towards him,” Kharge said.""The ministers of the Modi government should understand carefully that for crores of people like me, Babasaheb Ambedkar is no less than God... He is and will always be the messiah of Dalits, tribals, backward classes, minorities and the poor,” Kharge said in a post in Hindi on X.The BJP's defence of Amit Shah was led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The Prime Minister hit out at the Congress, saying its ""rotten ecosystem"" and ""malicious lies"" cannot hide its misdeeds and said the home minister had exposed the opposition party's ""dark history of insulting"" Ambedkar.Amit Shah also addressed a press conference and alleged that the Congress in the past has also misrepresented his and even PM Narendra Modi's comments to spread confusion and mislead people.""I condemn the Congress for twisting facts. Why did it happen? It happened because BJP leaders spoke on how the NDA governments upheld the Constitution and established with facts that the Congress is anti-Ambedkar, anti-Constitution and anti-reservation,"" Shah told reporters.""When all these facts came out, the Congress used its old tricks and made an effort to mislead the society by presenting twisted facts,"" Shah said, adding that he comes from a party that will never insult Ambedkar.Meanwhile, the uproar in Parliament also spilt onto the streets of the national capital and other states like Maharashtra, Bihar and Tamil Nadu where various parties held protests.In Delhi, AAP convenor Arvind Kejriwal led a protest with hundreds of supporters outside the BJP chanting slogans of ""Amit Shah maafi maango, Amit Shah sharm karo"".In Mumbai, Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Uddhav Thackeray said, ""Amit Shah's remarks on Dr Ambedkar show the party's (BJP's) arrogance and have exposed its true face.""""Prime Minister Modi should act against Amit Shah for his remarks on Dr Ambedkar and he should quit if he is not able to do so,"" the former chief minister said.West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee claimed that Union Home Minister's remarks about Ambedkar were a display of the BJP's ""casteist and anti-Dalit mindset"".""The mask has fallen! As Parliament reflects on 75 glorious years of the Constitution, HM @AmitShah chose to TARNISH this occasion with DEROGATORY remarks against Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, that too in the temple of Democracy,"" she posted on X.""This is a display of BJP's CASTEIST and ANTI-DALIT mindset. If this is how they behave after being reduced to 240 seats, imagine the damage they would've inflicted if their dream of 400 seats had been realised. They'd have rewritten history to entirely erase Dr. Ambedkar's contributions,"" she alleged.M K Stalin, the Tamil Nadu chief minister, said, ""Only those who commit more sins should be concerned about 'punya' (Good deeds). Those who are concerned about the country, its people and the protection of the Constitution will only utter the name of Babasaheb Dr Ambedkar and they will have to utter only his name.""""BJP leaders should hear this loud and clear, Babasaheb Ambedkar is our fashion, passion, inspiration and motivation as well,"" RJD leader and former Bihar deputy chief minister Tejashwi Yadav said.Former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav said they respected BR Ambedkar for his contribution to the framing of the Constitution.""You all should see what kind of language has been used by him in the Parliament'¦ This is the situation in Delhi. In UP, the kind of language our CM (Yogi Adityanath) uses in the House is not democratic.

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Monday came down heavily on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over the removal of the iconic 1971 war ""surrender"" painting from the Army headquarters in New Delhi with a new artwork, calling it part of a broader effort to alter India’s history.Congress MP Manickam Tagore submitted an adjournment motion notice in the Lok Sabha to address the removal of a 1971 war photograph from the Army Headquarters in New Delhi and its repercussions.In his notice to speaker Om Birla, Tagore expressed concern over the removal of the photograph, which marks the historic surrender of Pakistani forces in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on December 16, 1971. He called the act not only troubling but a direct insult to the historical significance of the event, urging the central government to ""immediately"" return the photograph to its original location.""This action is part of a disturbing trend observed in recent years, where similar efforts to alter or erase India's original history have been reported across various ministries, monuments, and defense establishments. These incidents appear to be part of a wider push by the PM Modi government to erase or reframe historical events that do not align with certain narratives,"" the Congress MP said.Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also hit out at the government, saying, ""A picture has been taken down from the headquarters of the Army in which the Pakistani Army is surrendering in front of the Indian Army .""A release from the Indian Army, featuring Army chief general Upendra Dwivedi welcoming his visiting Nepalese counterpart with the new painting in the background, was the first sign that the old photograph had been removed.Meanwhile, as the controversy grew over the removal of the iconic painting, the Indian Army informed on Monday that it has been installed ""to its most befitting place,"" at the Manekshaw Centre in New Delhi.""On the occasion of Vijay Diwas , General Upendra Dwivedi COAS, along with the President of Army Wives Welfare Association (AWWA), Sunita Dwivedi, installed the iconic 1971 surrender painting to its most befitting place, The Manekshaw Centre, named after the Architect and the Hero of 1971 War, Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw,"" Indian Army said in a post on X.Meanwhile, BJP MP Manoj Tiwari replied to Congress's criticism, saying, ""(We don't remove photographs, we have in fact put up new photographs of Rajiv Gandhi, Indira Gandhi, Manmohan Singh, PV Narasimha Rao in Prime Minister's Museum.The historic picture at the center of the row depicted Pakistan's Lt General A A K Niazi signing the Instrument of Surrender in 1971, alongside India’s Lt General Jagjit Singh Aurora .

‘Nazul’ land ownership row leaves many families in the lurch; threatens BJP’s civic poll prospects,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/nazul-land-ownership-row-leaves-many-families-in-the-lurch-threatens-bjps-civic-poll-prospects/articleshow/116457301.cms,"RUDRAPUR: The contentious issue of ‘Nazul’ land ownership in Rudrapur has re-emerged, casting a shadow over BJP’s prospects in the upcoming municipal elections. Thousands of families residing on govt land feel let down by state govt’s failure to appeal against a high court order that bars land ownership rights for unauthorised occupants.The state govt had proposed legislation on granting ownership rights to encroachers on govt land. However, a PIL was filed in the high court challenging the validity of the law. In 2018, HC stayed the state’s Nazul land freehold policy. Following this, the then BJP govt filed a special leave petition (SLP) in the Supreme Court which is yet to give a ruling on the matter. The state govt then introduced the Nazul Policy in 2021 under chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami . The policy, extended till Dec 2023, was hailed as a pro-poor initiative.However, on Feb 21, HC issued an interim order prohibiting the granting of ownership rights to encroachers until the disposal of the SLP. This stopped the state’s freehold campaign, leaving families in districts like Dehradun, Haridwar, Udham Singh Nagar, and Nainital in despair.More than 25,000 families occupy 1,800 acres of govt land in Rudrapur alone. Many, like local trader Gulshan Kumar Arya, have expressed frustration. “We waited for years, trusting the govt to secure our rights. This inaction feels like a betrayal,” he said.Despite the setback, the Rudrapur administration distributed land leases to 2,600 people on March 6, during a high-profile event officiated by the CM.Critics have questioned the legality of the move, given the standing court order. “The distribution of leases raises serious concerns about the govt’s adherence to legal norms,” said a legal expert.Sanjay Juneja, president of Rudrapur’s traders union, echoed the sentiment. “These families were hopeful the govt would advocate for them. The administration’s silence shattered their trust,” he said.Thousands of applications for freehold conversion remain pending with municipal corporations and collectorates. Residents have repeatedly visited govt offices, only to face delays. “This is sheer administrative apathy. The govt had ample time to appeal the High Court order but failed to act,” said a member of a citizens’ group.Meanwhile, opposition parties have seized the moment to target BJP. “The govt’s indecision on such a sensitive issue reveals its priorities,” said an opposition leader. “With a strong legal team, why wasn’t the order challenged? This is demoralising,” said Kishor Haldar, a Congress functionary. Even within BJP, discontent is brewing over the lack of advocacy.Political analysts said swift action could help the govt regain public trust. “The state must file an appeal in the Supreme Court immediately and ensure a resolution. This would demonstrate its commitment to the welfare of residents,” said Nayan Bhandari, a political observer.","Thousands of families residing on govt land feel let down by state govt’s failure to appeal against a high court order that bars land ownership rights for unauthorised occupants.

MEERUT: Four minor children suffered burns after nearly 150 election campaign balloons, purportedly released from Delhi and landed in an agricultural field in Meerut's Bantor village, burst after coming in contact with a bike silencer.The balloons bore campaign stickers of former Aam Aadmi Party MLA from the Delhi Cantonment seat, Commando Surendra Singh , who is now in BJP.Former pradhan of Batnor village Nayab Husain told TOI, ""These balloons fell in an agricultural field in our village.
