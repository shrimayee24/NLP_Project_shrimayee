People from SC, ST, OBC communities need not worry: Shah

Mahayuti will meet & decide after polls: Shah on CM face

MUMBAI: A very stringent anti-conversion law that will ensure zero religious conversions in Maharashtra will be enacted once the Mahayuti comes to power, promised Union home minister Amit Shah. On Sunday, he released the BJP’s “Sankalp Patra” (election manifesto) in Mumbai, listing 25 promises that the Mahayuti will fulfil if elected to power.Meanwhile, elsewhere in Maharashtra, Shah in his speech made it clear there will be no religion-based reservation for education and employment.The party has been wooing the Hindu community in this election, and the announcement is seen as a concrete attempt to take the party’s election slogans “Batenge toh Katenge (divided we shall be cut), Ek hain toh safe hai (We are safe if we are one)” a step forward. Speaking on the anti-conversion law, Shah said the BJP will form an internal committee to draft the anti-conversion law. “...after the Mahayuti forms the government, it will constitute a committee to hold discussions with all stakeholders. It will come up with very stringent laws so religious conversions do not take place,” said Shah.In Mumbai, Shah said PM Modi brought a bill to improve the Waqf Board, but in Karnataka, attempts were made to evict villages and even temples constructed on Waqf land. “When the opposition says it wants to improve the Waqf Board bill , it means this can happen even in Maharashtra,” he said. Shah addressed a press meet after the event.On who would be the next CM, Shah said after elections, the three parties will sit together and take a decision. On increasing number of family members of party members being given tickets , Shah said the party made attempts to reduce number of such candidates. “There are more family dynasts in MVA,” he said. On a common minimum programme, Shah said the first ten points of Sankalp Patra were of Mahayuti. “Every party will announce its own Sankalp Patra. Once Mahayuti forms govt, a committee of ministers from all three parties will be formed to pritise commitments made and ensure 100% implementation,” he said.Attacking Uddhav Thackeray, he said MVA promises are merely to “grab power”. Urging people to vote for Mahayuti, he said the 2019 people’s mandate was betrayed. “Thackeray should decide where he wants to sit. He is sitting with people who opposed abrogation of Article 370, amendment to CAA, NCR, Ram Mandir construction... I want to ask himif he can appeal to Rahul Gandhi to speak a few good words on Veer Savarkar, can he ask Congress members to say a few good words on Bal Thackeray.”","The party has been wooing the Hindu community in this election.

After the elections, all the three alliance partners will decide on the chief minister,"" Shah said.The home minister said the Shiv Sena and NCP split because Uddhav Thackeray prioritised his son over Eknath Shinde while Sharad Pawar preferred his daughter over Ajit Pawar.""These parties gave priority to their family members and the parties split.

""It is the Modi government which gave reservations to OBCs.

GUMLA/BOKARO/RANCHI: Congress’s “divide-and-rule” policy of several decades forms the crux of the JMM-led coalition’s strategy to stay in govt and snatch the rights of tribals, Dalits and OBCs in Jharkhand, PM Narendra Modi said Sunday at twin campaign rallies in Gumla and Bokaro.“Congress governed the country Independence onwards by keeping OBCs divided. Since 1990, it has been fighting for survival. So, it wants to divide the country along caste lines and break the SC, ST and OBC fraternity again by pitting one against the other. Ek rahenge toh safe rahenge (if we are united, we will be safe),” he said in tribal-dominant Gumla.Branding both Congress and its ally JMM “anti-tribal”, Modi accused the coalition – including RJD and CPI-ML – of looting the state’s natural resources to fill their coffers and taking bribes even for issuance of birth and death certificates.“Congress can’t tolerate tribals in high positions; it even opposed Droupadi Murmu when we made her President, while former CM Champai Soren was removed from the post by this very govt.”The PM, who also held a 3km roadshow from the OTC ground to Ratu Road in Ranchi, alleged that the Hemant Soren govt “supported” recruitment exam paper-leaks to the detriment of deserving candidates for jobs among the state’s youth.He assured that if a BJP-led govt assumed office, it would ensure all wrongdoers were identified and punished. “We will bust the paper-leak mafia created by Congress and JMM here. It is my guarantee. There will be a fair and transparent recruitment process, and nobody will have to bribe or pay a commission to get jobs or get their work done.”Modi also flagged illegal immigration from Bangladesh as a threat to tribal identity. On the Hemant govt’s charge of non-cooperation by the Centre, he said the BJP-led govt allocated more funds to Jharkhand in the past 10 years than UPA ever did, but fiscal mismanagement and corruption in the state stalled its growth.","JMM-led coalition's strategy is to stay in govt and snatch rights of tribals, Dalits and OBCs, PM Narendra Modi said.

These students contacted J&K Students’ Association, claiming they were “barred from laboratory sessions for not shaving or trimming” their beard.Principal Chandrashekhar said, “In hospital and labs, we need to follow standards of hygiene... On Nov 8, these students were sent out as they didn’t follow the instruction.” He noted these students had irregular attendance in academic activities.","Fifteen male and three female students from J&K are studying in Govt College of Nursing, Holenarasipur in Hassan.

"For the first time, 190 people to vote in own remote Maha village",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/for-the-first-time-190-people-to-vote-in-own-remote-maha-village/articleshow/115152721.cms,"A senior citizen after casting vote from her Thane home on Sunday

NADED: Waghdari, a village of 300 residents in Kinwat taluka of Maharashtra’s Nanded district, has just secured its own polling station despite having no presence on the country’s land revenue map even after 77 years of independence.Until the last election, the villagers would trek for over two hours, braving the elements and animal attacks, to cast their votes in Jaldhara, the nearest village. But in the Nov 20 assembly polls, they will vote for the first time in their village under Kinwat constituency . This has brought renewed hopes for recognition and long-pending land rights from govt.“Tell us where we belong” is the villagers’ refrain. They live deep in the teak forests of the Satmala range along the Telangana border. They claim Telangana abandoned them and Maharashtra never accepted them.Local SDO and revenue officer Kavali Meghana said the EC approved the polling station in Waghdari considering the challenging hilly terrain and dense forests. “Waghdari has 190 eligible voters,” Meghana said.Villager Datta Bhawale is still angry. “For four generations, we have called this place our home, but we have nothing to show for it from govt. Our gram panchayat is 35km away and we walk 10km to vote in any election. The nearest metalled road is a three-hour walk.”Others complained that they don’t have land ownership papers and no drinking water pipeline. “When we sought our land documents, they told us that we are not on the (revenue) map. We told them to tell us if we were from Telangana or Maharashtra. Finally, a govt official said we belonged to Maharashtra. It means nothing if we don’t have basic rights,” another villager said.Senior citizen Saraswati Varvate fretted that the hamlet’s only water source was a stream around 1km away. “No one comes here to campaign. We vote hoping for change. But whoever wins, we know we’re on our own,” he said.Without these papers, they can’t get road, crop insurance, borewells or subsidies, Shankar Gaikwad, another villager, said. “Wild animals destroy our crops. On the rare occasion when we get a good yield, transporting it over rough terrain with no road, drains any small profit we make. We grow just enough to survive most of the time,” Gaikwad said.DC Abhijit Raut has sent the land records proposal to revenue authorities in Pune. SDO Meghana cited historical reasons behind the problem. “Earlier, the area was attached to Adilabad district in Telangana during the Nizamshahi period. Last year, we conducted measurements in the village and sent the proposal to Pune. We are hopeful that within the next 4-5 months, the residents will receive what they’re entitled to from govt,” Meghana said.Till the promise rings true, Waghdari’s battle continues. Teacher Sidheshwar Vishwanath is the villagers’ only established link to govt. He lives in Islampur 16km away and he rides his two-wheeler to Jaldhara and then walks for 2 to 3 hours either way to reach seven students in a single-room, asbestos-sheet roofed school in Waghdari.After Std IV, children travel long distances to reach a bigger school, and many, especially girls, drop out because of the challenging commute that involves threats of possible attacks from leopards, bears and even tigers. “I just came across a bear this (Sunday) morning. I waited for it to leave before I could continue,” Vishwanath said.Life is tougher for women. For Maya Kale, who dropped out after Std XI, the journey to school was fraught with danger. “My parents worried about me and got me married,” Maya said. Most births are at home, and in emergencies, people are carried on makeshift stretchers to Jaldhara —a two-and-a-half-hour journey to reach the nearest road.","Waghdari, a village of 300 residents in Kinwat taluka of Maharashtra’s Nanded district, has just secured its own polling station.

CHANDIGARH: Upset with defence ministry repeatedly challenging court rulings in favour of ex-servicemen, Delhi high court has warned the ministry it may impose penalties if such challenges continue.“It is observed that despite repeated orders being issued by Armed Forces Tribunal (AFT) and upheld by this court, the ministry continues to file petitions here, raising similar legal questions,” HC noted in an order released last week.The court made the remarks in a case filed by Army and the ministry challenging the grant of a pension to a soldier in Defence Security Corps. HC has already dismissed over 350 petitions filed by govt on the same issue. Since 2023, Army and the ministry have been contesting AFT rulings on pensions and disability benefits across various high courts and in Supreme Court. SC has also issued various strictures in the past against excessive litigation initiated by the ministry.In 2022, SC expressed “displeasure” over ministry appeals in disability pension cases , and earlier this year, it awarded Rs 50 lakh in compensation to a soldier with HIV who had been denied a disability pension by both Army and AFT.In 2015, concerned about excessive litigation, PM Narendra Modi directed then defence minister Manohar Parrikar to find ways to reduce it.","HC has already dismissed over 350 petitions filed by govt on the same issue.

The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections , which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases. The results will be declared on November 23, along with Maharashtra.In the Tribal-dominated state, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and CM Hemant's Soren Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) are in a direct fight, while the Congress party and Lalu Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) are in alliance with the JMM.The JMM-Congress-RJD alliance are also reportedly seeking to deal with Left parties, Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party and other tribal outfits that have been contesting the elections in the state as independent entities and make efforts to field candidates against the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) on all 81 seats collectively.In the last assembly polls in 2019, the JMM-Congress-RJD alliance won a comfortable majority of 47 seats in a House of 81.The BJP slipped to 25 seats from 37 it held in 2014. The poor performance was perceived to be the outcome of its decision to contest alone backfiring. The party did not foster an alliance with the Ajsu in the 2019 polls when Raghubar Das, currently the Odisha governor, was serving the state as CM.In this year's Lok Sabha polls in Jharkhand, the BJP-led NDA secured nine out of the 14 seats, with the BJP winning eight and its alliance partner, the Ajsu (All Jharkhand Students Union) Party, retaining its single seat.On the other hand, the opposition India bloc improved its tally, increasing its seat count from two in 2019 to five in the parliamentary polls.BJP and JMM have spruced up their pace of campaigning from the ground zero to social media. BJP and JMM leaders are actively rebutting and challenging each other on a range of issues, including illegal immigration, youth welfare, employment and housing.INDIA bloc parties in Jharkhand slammed the EC for holding assembly elections in the state along with that of Maharashtra but claimed that they were ready to slug it out with BJP-led NDA, which has welcomed the announcement of poll dates.JMM, Congress, and CPI (ML-L) said the announcement showed that EC was in a hurry to conduct elections though the assembly tenure was due to end in January next year.Also, both the INDIA bloc and BJP-led NDA are expected to get into huddles to discuss the modalities of seat-sharing which is going to be a challenge for both the competing teams.","The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections, which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra. Elections in Maharashtra will be held in single phase on November 20. The counting of votes will be on November 23.Maharashtra is gearing up for elections as the two major political alliances—the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) and the Mahayuti—prepare to face each other for the first time in a Vidhan Sabha election.The Maha Vikas Aghadi, comprise of the Congress, the Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray), and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) under Sharad Pawar, will go head-to-head with the Mahayuti , which includes the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Shiv Sena faction led by Eknath Shinde, and the NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar. This will be the first electoral contest between these two alliances since the splits within the Shiv Sena and NCP.The MVA is hopeful of replicating its recent Lok Sabha success, while the Mahayuti aims to retain power by leveraging its populist schemes targeted at women and youth. Both alliances have set their sights on winning the state.Narayan Rane, a former Union Minister and the victor in the Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg Lok Sabha constituency, is poised to be a key figure for the BJP in the Konkan region during the forthcoming elections. Meanwhile, two constituencies are expected to be critical battlegrounds: chief minister Eknath Shinde's Kopri-Pachpakdi seat in Thane City and Worli in Mumbai, where Aaditya Thackeray, a leader of the Shiv Sena (UBT), is seeking reelection.In the last Vidhan Sabha elections in 2019, the BJP secured 26.1% of the votes, the Congress 16.1%, the NCP 16.9%, and the Shiv Sena 16.6%. The BJP and the Shiv Sena (then united) formed the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which secured a majority. However, the coalition soon crumbled due to disagreements over government formation, plunging the state into a political crisis.After no party could establish a government, Maharashtra was placed under President's rule. Devendra Fadnavis was briefly sworn in as chief minister, with Ajit Pawar as deputy chief minister. However, both resigned just days later before a scheduled floor test.By November 28, 2019, a new coalition emerged, with the Shiv Sena (Uddhav faction), NCP (Sharad Pawar faction), and Congress forming the Maha Vikas Aghadi government, led by Uddhav Thackeray as chief minister.The state's politics took another turn in June, 2022, when Uddhav Thackeray resigned following a rebellion within the Shiv Sena, led by Eknath Shinde, who then allied with the BJP. Eknath Shinde assumed the role of chief minister, with Devendra Fadnavis returning as deputy chief minister.",The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra. Elections in Maharashtra will be held in single phase on November 20. The counting of votes will be on November 23.

Kharge slams Modi as 'chief of lies' over unfulfilled promises and BJP's divisive politics,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/pm-narendra-modi-didnt-keep-promises-is-jhoot-ka-sardar-says-mallikarjun-kharge/articleshow/115123960.cms,"Mallikarjun Kharge

NAGPUR: In a vitriolic attack on PM Narendra Modi, Cong president Mallikarjun Kharge on Saturday termed him as ‘jhoothon ka sardar' (chieftain of lies) for ""unfulfilled promises"" and inconsistent messages within BJP.Addressing media here on Saturday, Kharge highlighted the gap between Modi's pledges including — bringing back black money stashed abroad, creating two crore jobs annually, reducing inflation, and doubling minimum support prices for farmers — and ground reality.Flanked by Congress leaders, including Vijay Wadettiwar, Abhijit Wanjarri, and Atul Londhe, Kharge accused BJP for ""double-speak"" on the issue of unity. While PM Modi professes ""Ek hai toh safe hai"" (we are safe if united), UP CM Yogi Adityanath's makes an oft-repeated rhetoric ""batenge toh katenge"" (divided we perish), Kharge said to prove his point. ""The BJP should first decide which slogan to follow – Yogi's or Modi's,"" Kharge said.Kharge criticised Yogi's slogan as ‘divisive', arguing that it was inappropriate in Maharashtra, the land of Saints like Tukadoji and Gadge Maharaj who preached unity and inclusivity. ""Yogi's attire reflects spirituality. He should quit politics and focus on spiritual pursuits instead of wearing the saffron robe and making divisive statements. Perhaps, he would be better suited to a life of spiritual service in Varanasi,"" Kharge said.Responding to BJP's criticism of Cong MP Rahul Gandhi's display of Constitution's copy in a red cover, Kharge pointed out that PM Modi himself gifted a similar copy to former President Ram Nath Kovind. ""Is it a crime to show a copy of the Constitution with a red cover?"" Kharge asked.Cong president defended Gandhi's call to ""save the Constitution"", stating, ""It is this sacred book that has given us freedom of expression, fundamental rights, and reservations."" He took a strong exception to BJP's ‘urban Naxal' barb at Gandhi arguing that such accusations only expose BJP's inability to respect divergent views.Kharge accused the BJP of resorting to ""tod-fod"" (divide and rule) politics by allegedly engineering defections to form governments, including Mahayuti in Maharashtra. ""People have seen how they (BJP) split regional parties (NCP and Shiv Sena) and ‘stole' their MLAs,"" he said, suggesting that Mahayuti is a coalition of convenience, not ideology.In response to PM Modi's critique of Cong-led Karnataka govt, Kharge asserted that the grand old party fulfilled its election promises in the state, listing initiatives like free bus services for women, stipends, and free food for Below Poverty Line cardholders. ""For a PM to lie so blatantly about Karnataka government's performance is shameful,"" he said. ""Perhaps he should tell us about his achievements in 13 years as Gujarat CM and 11 years as PM.""Turning his attention to local leaders, Kharge took an indirect swipe at Union minister Nitin Gadkari and Maharashtra deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis, questioning their contribution to Vidarbha's development. Kharge accused them of focusing more on protecting their political careers than advocating for substantial investments in Vidarbha. ""Mega projects like Tata-Airbus, which would have generated hundreds of jobs in Vidarbha, were moved to Gujarat, but leaders here kept mum.""Kharge lambasted Modi's track record on high-profile infrastructure projects, including the much-publicised bullet train. He highlighted structural failures, including Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj statue crash in Maharashtra and bridge in Gujarat's Morbi that collapsed barely days after being inaugurated by Modi. ""Over 400 railway mishaps occurred in PM's tenure,"" Kharge claimed, adding that ""instances of farmers dying by suicide and crimes against women continue to rise.""Earlier, Kharge addressed two rallies in Amravati's Teosa (for Yashomati Thakur) and Nagpur North (Nitin Raut), highlighting Congress's message of unity, inclusivity, and a commitment to constitutional values. He criticised BJP for allegedly creating divisions among communities for electoral gains. ""Congress has always protected the Constitution, standing by the values of equality and unity,"" he asserted.","Mallikarjun Kharge attacks PM Narendra Modi for 'unfulfilled promises' and inconsistent messages within BJP.

In that year, when their 13 MLAs were elected in Maharashtra, this seat was also won by MNS.After that, Shiv Sena won this seat again in 2014, but later in 2019, MNS's Raju Patil won it again and earned the reputation of being the only MNS MLA in the whole of Maharashtra.Shiv Sena wants to capture this seat again, for which this time Shrikant Shinde has made Rajesh More, Shiv Sena's President of Dombivli and a five-time corporator, his candidate.Shrikant has warned his supporters that they have to win this seat at any cost because last time they lost this seat by just a few votes and has appealed to the workers not to be negligent about this seat.","Several MNS party functionaries left the party and joined Shiv Sena in the presence of Kalyan Lok Sabha MP Shrikant Shinde.

MumbaiShiv Sena (UBT) on Saturday released its second list of candidates for the assembly elections . Twenty candidates were named in the list, bringing the total declared candidates from the Uddhav Thackeray-led party to 85. The list was announced in parts: in Saamna, the party mouthpiece, in the morning and then late evening.Late on Saturday, the party in a post on X named former MLA Vinod Ghosalkar as its official candidate from Dahisar and Bhairulal Chaudhary Jain as candidate from Malabar Hill. BJP’s Mangal Prabhat Lodha is the sitting MLA from Malabar Hill.Sena (UBT) declared former two-term BJP MLA Anil Gote from Dhule city; Gote joined Sena (UBT) this week.

Jamsutkar was earlier in the Congress.The CM Eknath Shinde-led Sena’s Yamini Jadhav is sitting MLA from Byculla.In the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), both Sena (UBT) and Congress were keen on contesting the Byculla seat. The Sena (UBT), political observers said, was looking for a strong candidate from Byculla to challenge Yamini. While former mayor Kishori Pednekar and former corporator Ramakant Rahate were also in the fray, the party picked Jamsutkar as a local face.After holding back the ticket for the Sewri constituency, the Sena (UBT) decided to give the ticket to sitting MLA Ajay Chaudhari.

MUMBAI: The Worli assembly seat in Mumbai is set to witness a big electoral bout with former Congress LS MP and currently Shiv Sena RS MP Milind Deora entering the fray against sitting MLA Aaditya Thackeray of the Shiv Sena (UBT).With Deora's entry and MNS's Sandeep Deshpande already having filed his nomination papers from the seat, the fight in fact will be a three-way one, just like in the neighbouring Mahim seat, where there is a Sena (Sada Sarvankar) vs Sena (UBT) (Mahesh Sawant) vs MNS (Amit Thackeray) fight.""CM Eknath Shinde believes that justice for Worli and Worlikars is long overdue. Together, we're paving the way forward and will share our vision soon. It's Worli now!"" Deora said in a post on X on Friday, indicating he has been picked for the seat.Though Worli hasn't appeared on Sena's declared list yet, a senior Sena functionary said Deora's name was final.Both BJP and Sena led by Eknath Shinde were keen on fighting the high-profile seat, but it has gone to Sena in the Mahayuti arrangement.Deora, son of late Congress politician Murli Deora, was Congress MP for two terms (from 2004 to 2014) from Mumbai South , the Lok Sabha seat under which the Worli assembly seat falls.Deora was earlier this year in the race for the Mumbai South Lok Sabha seat too, but it was given to Sena MLA Yamini Jadhav who lost to Sena's (UBT) Arvind Sawant. Deora, a former Congress MP and Union minister, quit Congress early this year and joined Sena and got a Rajya Sabha nomination. Worli is part of the Mumbai South Lok Sabha seat. Aaditya filed his nomination from Worli on Thursday.From BJP, Shaina NC had been campaigning in the constituency. However, Sena had said that this seat would be fought by their nominee. Sources said Shaina NC, who had indicated her willingness to contest on a Sena ticket, lost out on account of the BJP's internal conflict.Making his political debut in the 2019 assembly polls, Aaditya, who became the first member of the Thackeray family to contest an election, defeated his NCP rival Suresh Mane by a margin of over 70,000 votes.However, in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, the Sena (UBT) candidate Arvind Sawant got a lead of only 6,715 votes from the Worli seat .While Sena had for long not been able to identify any candidate from this seat, both CM Eknath Shinde and his son MP Dr Shrikant Shinde had remained focused on it and visited it frequently. In Sept, heating up the political atmosphere in Worli, Shrikant Shinde visited Worli as part of his 'jansamvad yatra.'In 2022, soon after the MVA government was toppled, Aaditya wrote an emotional letter to residents of his constituency on completing three years as MLA. In his letter, Aaditya had also taken a dig at the BJP, without naming the party, saying that every party now wants to spend time and money in his constituency as Worli had made enviable progress. Aaditya said that they (rival parties) too wanted to come to Worli now. In his letter, Aaditya had hit out at the CM Eknath Shinde-led faction for ""indulging in dirty politics and betrayal.""","Worli assembly seat in Mumbai set to witness a big electoral bout.

JAIPUR: The state college education commissionerate issued a directive for 20 govt colleges to repaint their front facades and entry halls in shades of orange and white as part of the Kayakalp scheme, aimed at creating a positive campus environment.The move has sparked a political row with the Congress party alleging that the BJP-led state govt is using educational institutions to project its politics symbolically.The directive, which follows a recent decision to replace black bicycles with saffron-coloured ones across the state, specifies that colleges use 'Asian Paints White Gold 8292' and 'Asian Paints Orange Crown 7974' for repainting.According to officials, 'Orange Crown' is a light saffron shade selected to invoke feelings of energy, enthusiasm, and optimism, distinct from the deeper saffron on the BJP flag. ""Saffron, when used on a building's facade, creates a welcoming and positive first impression, making people feel uplifted and drawn to the place,"" one official explained.However, the Congress criticised the initiative as an attempt to politicise educational spaces. ""The BJP govt is imposing its ideology in colleges,"" said PCC general secretary Swarnim Chaturvedi. ""With no significant achievements to showcase, the govt is resorting to such symbolic gestures to distract people from its unmet promises.""The Kayakalp scheme will be initially implemented across 20 govt colleges, with two institutions selected from each division for the first phase. Officials suggest that more colleges could be included in the future as part of broader beautification and revitalisation efforts.Responding to Congress' allegations, BJP spokesperson Laxmikant Bhardwaj defended the colour choice and accused the opposition of promoting an ""anti-Hindu mindset"". ""Opposing orange colour highlights Congress' biases,"" Bhardwaj stated. ""They would like to paint everything green to cater to a particular community for votes. The Kayakalp scheme will extend to all colleges in the coming months.""",The Kayakalp scheme will be initially implemented across 20 govt colleges.

Maha formula a setback for Congress, says party neta

MUMBAI: At a point when it appeared Maha Vikas Aghadi could be on the verge of collapse owing to lack of consensus over a seat-sharing formula for assembly polls, MVA's architect & NCP (SP) chief Sharad Pawar stepped in to draft an acceptable agreement.Following a meeting of MPCC president Nana Patole, UBT Shiv Sena's Sanjay Raut, NCP (SP)'s Jayant Patil and CLP leader Balasaheb Thorat with Sharad Pawar, an understanding was reached on Wednesday evening over contesting 255 seats: Congress , NCP (SP) and UBT Sena would fight 85 each, while 18 seats would be left for smaller parties who are allies. There is still no call on 15 disputed seats - 3 in Mumbai & 12 in Vidarbha, but they will be distributed among MVA partners, sources said.UBT Sena’s Sanjay Raut said following Sharad Pawar’s intervention, the process of drafting the seat-sharing formula was expedited as most candidates were in favour of filing nomination papers on Thursday as it is being seen as an auspicious day. Raut initially said at a press meet that consensus had been reached on 270 seats. Later he said, “I had said 270 seats, but it was 255.”A senior Congress politician said the new formula is being seen as a major setback for Congress because on Tuesday, it had been informally agreed that Congress would contest 105 seats, NCP (SP) 84 and UBT Shiv Sena 95. “Since there was no end in sight to the negotiations, Congress decided to go some steps back and agreed on 85 seats. We are sure that we will improve on our Lok Sabha polls performance, and in addition, we expect to secure additional seats from the remaining 15,” the politician said.As it appeared that no agreement could be reached, state Congress functionaries knocked at the doors of AICC president Mallikarjun Kharge, who summoned the Congress state functionaries to New Delhi for discussions.Kharge then deployed Congress legislature party leader Balasaheb Thorat to call on both Sharad Pawar and UBT Sena president Uddhav Thackeray to resolve the dispute. Accordingly, Thorat had a brief meeting with both Pawar and Thackeray, but even then the dispute was not resolved, after which Congress netas felt that it was time to exit from MVA and contest the polls separately.NCP (SP) leadership took note of these developments and felt that if MVA does not contest elections jointly, Mahayuti is sure to retain power in the state. Pawar then spoke to Raut, Thorat and Thackeray and asked them to expedite matters and decide the seat-sharing formula on “as is where is” basis (meaning they should go ahead with what has been decided already) instead of discussing it on a seat-to-seat basis until the final seat is decided. However, notwithstanding Pawar’s words to the warring netas, the row over the 15 disputed seats remains unresolved.","Congress, NCP (SP) and UBT Sena would fight 85 each, while 18 seats would be left for smaller parties who are allies.

NEW DELHI: Amid the ongoing stalemate over seat-sharing arrangements in the Mahayuti alliance over at least four seats in Mumbai and adjoining areas, senior BJP functionaries, including Maharashtra deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis and state president Chandrashekhar Bawankule on Wednesday called on Union home minister Amit Shah to explore possible solutions.BJP released its first list of 99 candidates last Sunday after which Shiv Sena workers opposed BJP candidates in at least four seats, including Kalyan East , Thane, Navi Mumbai and Murbad.They have threatened not to campaign for BJP candidates in these constituencies, which could have a ripple effect in other constituencies in the region as well. In Kalyan East, BJP has fielded Sulabha Gaikwad, wife of sitting MLA Ganpat Gaikwad.Gaikwad is currently in jail for allegedly firing on Shiv Sena neta Mahesh Gaikwad inside a police station. Sena functionaries have opposed Sulabha Gaikwad's nomination since the beginning.Shiv Sena workers are also not happy with BJP's decision to field Sanjay Kelkar in Thane, who is considered Shiv Sena chief and CM Eknath Shinde's stronghold. Besides this, they are opposing the candidature of Ganesh Naik in Airoli in Navi Mumbai and Kishan Kathore in Murbad constituency.Sources said Sena leadership isn't ready to accede to BJP's decision of contesting the above seats and is contemplating fielding is own candidates, thus raising prospect of 'friendly fights', something which threatens to negate the advantage which the saffron alliance hoped to reap on account of the fight among rival Maha Vikas Aghadi partners.BJP sources, however, said the party brass would sort out the differences, and pointed out that allies, including NCP of Ajit Pawar, have reached a consensus on the majority of seats. Sources said BJP is likely to contest over 160 seats followed by Sena and NCP.Assembly elections in Maharashtra will take place in a single phase on Nov 20 and counting of votes will take place on November 23.","BJP released its first list of 99 candidates last Sunday.

Nawab Malik back on NCP ticket against Mahayuti pick,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nawab-malik-back-on-ncp-ticket-against-mahayuti-pick/articleshow/114751562.cms,"MUMBAI: In a major embarrassment for the Mahayuti, former minister Nawab Malik who faces a money laundering probe, filed his nomination papers as a candidate of the Ajit Pawar-led NCP in Mankhurd-Shivajinagar. This creates a peculiar situation within the Mahayuti alliance because the Shiv Sena has also fielded a candidate from the same seat.A month ago when Malik declared he would contest as an NCP nominee from Shivajinagar, the BJP leadership comprising deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis , state BJP chief Chandrashekhar Bawankule and his Mumbai counterpart Ashish Shelar had expressed disapproval, arguing that he was accused of links with the underworld and Dawood Ibrahim.Significantly, after poll dates were declared and NCP shortlisted its nominees, Malik was given the authorisation form by the party, but the decision was not made public. On Tuesday, he first submitted his nomination as an independent candidate before the returning officer in Mankhurd. After a few hours, he submitted another form as an NCP nominee.Malik said the NCP's decision reflects the leadership's confidence in him.""I am not bothered by opposition to my candidature. I am thankful to Pawar, Praful Patel, and Sunil Tatkare for expressing confidence in me,"" Malik told TOI. Malik said he was confident of his victory as well as of his daughter Sana from neighbouring Anushaktinagar constituency. ""I am sure my daughter and I will win in the elections despite the presence of several rebels in both constituencies,"" Malik said.Shelar reacted saying ""BJP will not campaign for Malik. Accordingly, instructions have been given to our grassroots level workers.""On Malik's daughter Sana Malik, Shelar said until any evidence or information comes to light, the alliance candidate is the BJP candidate as well.Mankhurd is a stronghold of the Samajwadi Party, and has been represented by Abu Azmi for three consecutive terms. In the last election, he won against a Sena candidate, which is the reason the Sena was officially allocated the seat this time.Malik who is also a three-term MLA, was a minister in the MVA govt. He was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act on Feb 23, 2022. Malik was granted bail on medical grounds in July this year. The Shiv Sena's Suresh Patil, known as 'Bullet Patil', is the official Sena candidate here.",Former minister Nawab Malik faces a money laundering probe. He filed his nomination papers as a candidate of the Ajit Pawar-led NCP. This creates a peculiar situation within the Mahayuti alliance. The Shiv Sena has also fielded a candidate from the same seat.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114751662,imgsize-1115077,width-400,resizemode-4/114751662.jpg"
