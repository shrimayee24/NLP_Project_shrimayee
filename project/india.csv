"Godfrey Phillips ED accuses mom of assault, court issues summonses",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/godfrey-phillips-ed-accuses-mom-of-assault-court-issues-summonses/articleshow/128283547.cms,"NEW DELHI: A Delhi court has issued summonses to industrialist Bina Modi and senior advocate Lalit Bhasin in an assault case filed by her son and Godfrey Phillips India (GPI) executive director Samir Modi, observing that there is sufficient “prima facie material” to proceed against them.Samir had lodged a complaint at Delhi’s Sarita Vihar police station in 2024, alleging that Bina’s personal security officer, Surendra Prasad, physically assaulted him and prevented him from entering a board meeting at GPI’s Jasola office on May 30.According to the prosecution, the attack resulted in a fractured right index finger. It was submitted that the injury was so grave that the finger was “broken into two parts and required a screw and wire to be put together”.In 2025, Delhi Police filed a chargesheet naming Prasad under CrPC sections 325 and 341, but submitted there was “insufficient material” to proceed against Bina and Bhasin. Samir subsequently filed a protest petition seeking cognisance against them as well. He alleged that Prasad stopped him from entering the boardroom on Bina’s instructions and assaulted him when he insisted on attending.Bina and Bhasin later insisted on proceeding with the meeting despite his injury, Samir further alleged.Judicial magistrate Aneeza Bishnoi observed that although the evidence against Bina and Bhasin was circumstantial, there was sufficient material indicating their prima facie involvement. The court held that the investigating officer could not “exonerate” them “based on the sole statement” of Prasad.The medico-legal certificate and CCTV footage showed that an altercation took place, the court said, and summoned all three on May 7. A detailed evaluation of evidence isn’t required at this stage, the court noted, adding that the “material forms a prima facie chain suggesting a meeting of minds among the accused”.Commenting on Prasad’s conduct, Bishnoi said even if the complainant wasn’t invited to the meeting, “causing grievous injury would be unlawful”. The court also took note of Prasad’s changing statements regarding whether he stopped only Samir from attending the meeting. While it was claimed that others were also not allowed in, the court pointed out that the submitted footage showed only Samir being barred.","A Delhi court has issued summonses to industrialist Bina Modi and senior advocate Lalit Bhasin.

'Batenge Toh Katenge': Uddhav & Raj Thackeray Unite For Mumbai Civic Polls | Shiv Sena (UBT) | MNS

NEW DELHI: Senior Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) leader Sandeep Deshpande alleged on Thursday that Shiv Sena (UBT) corporators were each paid Rs 1 crore to back the BJP in the mayoral election, paving the way for the saffron party’s candidate to be elected mayor of Chandrapur Municipal Corporation.Shiv Sena (UBT) contested last month’s civic body elections in Mumbai in alliance with the MNS, a development that brought together Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray and MNS president Raj Thackeray — cousins who had been estranged for years. At the state level, the Uddhav Thackeray-led party continues to be part of the opposition alliance Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), alongside the Congress and the NCP (Sharad Pawar).Tensions have since surfaced between the Congress and Sena (UBT) after the BJP, with the support of Sena (UBT) corporators, succeeded in getting its mayor candidate elected in the Chandrapur Municipal Corporation, despite the Congress emerging as the single largest party in the civic polls. The grand old party lost by just one vote.""Every Shiv Sena (UBT) corporator received Rs 1 crore in Chandrapur, apart from other offers.An independent corporator was given Rs 50 lakh,"" Deshpande, the MNS' Mumbai unit chief, claimed.Both Sena (UBT) and the BJP rubbished the allegation.Deshpande further slammed the Uddhav Thackeray-led outfit for crying foul when the MNS supported the BJP but deeming it ""correct behaviour"" when Sena (UBT) itself did the same.He was referring to the local MNS leadership in Kalyan-Dombivli extending support to the rival Shiv Sena led by Maharashtra deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde following the civic elections, a move criticised by senior Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut.Shiv Sena (UBT)’s Chandrapur district president Sandeep Girhe hit back at Deshpande, saying he would resign if the MNS leader produced proof that corporators had received money. Girhe also accused local Congress leaders of insulting Sena (UBT) functionaries in the district.Deshpande, meanwhile, targeted Sanjay Raut, questioning whether the senior Sena (UBT) leader had been kept in the dark or had chosen to “wear a blindfold” during the developments in Chandrapur.Raut met MNS president Raj Thackeray in Mumbai on Thursday. Speaking to reporters later, he blamed the Congress for the setback in Chandrapur, saying it should have held more serious discussions with local Sena (UBT) corporators.According to Raut, local Congress factions led by MP Pratibha Dhanorkar and Vijay Wadettiwar failed to arrive at a “consensus”. He added that he had spoken to senior Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and KC Venugopal on the issue.“Uddhav Thackeray is personally looking into it. Corporators from Chandrapur will be summoned to Mumbai in a day or two. Uddhav Thackeray's stand was that under no circumstances the party should do anything that will help the BJP, and that stand continues even today,” the Rajya Sabha MP said.BJP’s Sangeeta Khandekar won the Chandrapur mayoral election by a single vote, defeating Congress candidate Vaishali Mahadule. Sena (UBT) corporator Prashant Danav was elected deputy mayor.The development has raised serious questions about Opposition unity and the viability of the MVA. Chandrapur is among the few municipal corporations where the Congress emerged as the single largest party and had been expected to secure the mayor’s post.In the elections to the 66-member civic body, the Congress won 27 seats, followed by the BJP with 23.",Shiv Sena (UBT) contested last month’s civic body elections in Mumbai in alliance with the MNS. Tensions have since surfaced between the Congress and Sena after the BJP succeeded in getting its mayor candidate elected in the Chandrapur Municipal Corporation.
