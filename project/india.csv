A fresh fight

Symbol of defiance

Ground realities

JULANA : Vinesh Phogat ’s kaafila is running three hours late. What should have been a 3 pm Sunday afternoon election rally at village Gatauli is taking place hurriedly at dusk. Fine specimens of buffaloes make their way back home in twos, unperturbed by the organised cacophony that has engulfed them — tractors and SUVs parked at odd angles, pamphlets hauled out and passed around, hundreds of bright orange laddoos in huge wicker baskets being carried in as a village’s offering to their guest.Everyone seems to be coming in everyone else’s way, but no one seems to mind.Elections in Haryana are a public affair and like most things in the state, mostly a male exercise. The women, heads covered, look on, bunched together from terrace tops or at the threshold of their homes.Despite the humidity and the wait, the elders’ pagris are still in place and there’s always a proud, stiff community hookah gurgling away close by. It adds to the sense of pride they are feeling on Vinesh being picked by the Congress to contest from Julana in the Haryana assembly elections, which by extension is a representation of village Bakhta Khera, her in laws’ home. The symbolism is significant. “Notice how she had her head covered with her dupatta here,” says Sewa Singh in Julana, a Jatmajority agricultural belt.“Ab bahu hai, toh naata toh hai, lekin vote ka agley mahineyhi dekhenge (she’s a daughter-in-law of the village, so there’s that connection, but we’ll think about voting next month),” says Sewa, 52, smiling enigmatically, referring to the October 5 polling day.“Arrey, abhi toh aayi hai chhori (she has finally come here),” is the common refrain here on Vinesh’s much-awaited arrival after her Paris Olympics saga. Ensuring her win is being seen as a moral duty for Julana. It is a matter of the pagri.“Woh Julana ki bahu hai, yahan sey chunav ladh rahi hai. (Charkhi) Dadri uska ghar hai, wahan sey bhi umeedwar bann sakti thi, lekin usney Julana chuna (she’s Julana’s daughter-in-law and chose to contest from here though she could’ve chosen Charkhi Dadri, which is her home),” says a Bakhta Khera local, one of the many accompanying Vinesh on the campaign trail.He has all the numbers at his fingertips, calling Gatauli a “6,000-vote village, 50% Jat, 50% others, all farmers”. He is confident the village will vote overwhelmingly for her. “She’ll also get the Pandit and Yadav vote,” he says.In Gatauli, someone starts a generator and bright yellow lights come on, focussing on the diminutive centre of everybody’s attention. The light bounces off Vinesh’s face as she addresses the gathering.Soon, it is dark. There are a handful of villages still to visit but Vinesh, wiping away the sweat with her dupatta, cannot resist a quip. “Godde hi toot gaye, bhai-saab (it’s like the knees have given way),” she says of her back-breaking new routine. Her earthy self-deprecation draws uproarious laughter, and she adds after a Vajpayee-like dramatic pause, “Lekin mujhe aana toh tha (but I had to come)…”In this, the second coming of Vinesh, she may well be talking of her new calling in life, or maybe a new round in her continuing fight. Because Vinesh is all about the fight — right from secretly defying patriarch Mahavir Phogat’s diktat and maintaining a Facebook account as a 17-yearold in her native Balali in 2012 to shaking the world’s sensibilities as a much-abused, vilified and isolated social outcast who stormed into the wrestling final at Paris just a month ago. Paris would have immediately become India’s greatest, most oddsdefying sporting achievement, our very own version of the ‘Rumble in the Jungle’, probably even bigger given what she had been fighting against — the might of the state. Of course, it didn’t happen that way. What happened was Jantar Mantar — broken godde, but unbroken spirit.Jantar Mantar defines the Vinesh fight. Maybe, somewhere she transcends her narrow definition of Olympic wrestler to a stubborn, unwavering warrior of women’s rights and safety. Indeed, Vinesh in a wrestler’s singlet is a very brief, almost fading image on the flexi boards and car windshields. It has now made way for the image of a dupatta-donning Jat girl, head bowed, seeking haq for her community.Remind her here of her promise to talk in Paris — “Final ke baad baat karenge, sir ji. Abhi weight pakadna hai (let’s talk after the final, have to sort my weight now)” — and she speaks her mind. “Maaf kar do bhaisaab, election chal raha hai, kushti nahin hai ki khatam ho gayi (forgive me, this is an election; not a wrestling match )…”Maybe the kushti is really over. It is a different battle now. She may remember Paris, she hasn’t forgotten Jantar Mantar. Looks like the people of Julana too haven’t.Many see a reflection of their own identities in that version of Vinesh, such as Madhubala, the fiery vice president of the Haryana Students’ Federation of India. The 22-year-old law student from Kurukshetra and other SFI karyakartas have been accompanying Vinesh on her campaign. “It is often difficult to meet her. But if we don’t stand with her now, then when?” she asks, adding that her team had regularly dropped in at the protest at Jantar Mantar and even taken out morchas in Kurukshetra during that time.Earlier last week, at the launch of her election office at the old bus stand in Julana, party workers had organised a havan to kickstart her election campaign. It was attended by thousands of farmers and supporters from all over Haryana. She would effortlessly blend into the crowd, head bent to seek their blessings, sit among them, exchange serious talk, crack a joke that would leave many seniors with wide missing-teeth guffaws. It was hard to tell who was seeking out whom. Was it the vote-seeking “opportunistic” former wrestler, as the haters claimed she was, or was it the local in this male-dominated agricultural belt?“This is a one-sided fight. It’ll be an anti-BJP, anti-Centre vote,” said Balbir, 75, from village Etala Kalan in Hisar district. He is accompanied by half-a-dozen senior farmers from the Bharatiya Kisan Union, their green badges sitting proudly on their spotless white kurtas.“Pehle humare kisanon ko maraa, phir humare pehalwanon ko, humari bachchiyon ko. Vinesh ki ladai hum sab ki ladai hai (first they attacked the farmers, then our wrestlers and daughters; Vinesh’s fight is our fight),” says Om Prakash, 75.But not all are happy. Congress may not have won here since 2005, but the party’s old guard was taken aback by the election ticket to Vinesh. Parminder Singh Dhull, a two-time former MLA with Indian National Lok Dal, was largely expected to get the ticket. His phone was switched off in the early days of Vinesh’s campaign.Others like Dharampal Kataria are more pragmatic. “Yes, it is often a setback when a new person is put on a seat that we have been working for, but if the party wants it that way, we will obey and guide her,” he says. The Haryana Pradesh Congress Committee secretary is the backbone of the campaign, the silent presence in an otherwise noisy trail. “Our target is to win by at least 50,000 votes,” he says.“Main toh sirf ek zariya hoon, sirf ek chehraa. Asli kaam toh aap ko karna hai (I’m just a face, the real job you’ll have to do),” Vinesh extols the residents of Jai Jaiwanti in everyday Urdu, but soon local rustic Haryanvi takes over. “Bahut pyar diya laadli ko. Yahan ki bahu hoon, lekin beti sey zyadaa pyaar diya hai (I’m a daughter-in-law here, but have got more love than a daughter),” she says.It resonates with the women, cutting across caste lines. “Humare liye toh ab Vinesh Phogat hi sab kuch hai (We are all rooting for Vinesh now),” 30-year-old Seema Devi has no doubt where her allegiance lies. “Dilli-waali sarkar ne hamari naukriyaan khaa li. Vinesh ney iss sarkar ke khilaaf morcha nikala (jobs have disappeared under the central govt. Vinesh sat in protest against this govt),” says the law graduate who belongs to the Prajapati (Kumhar) community.Not far, in a covered trailer, a group of women of varying ages wait for their driver. Hesitant to speak first, the oldest of them, 80-year-old Ramoorti Daadi declares, “Vinesh ko hi vote devengey (it’s Vinesh that we’ll vote for).”This sense of independent choicemaking is in contrast to a group of pilgrims headed for Khatu near Sikar in Rajasthan. “It’s not going to be that easy for Vinesh. There are four Jat candidates here and BJP is also strong,” says the leader of the group. Another pipes in, “The women will vote for whoever the family elders ask us to.”The women in the group are silent, but one chips in. “I’ll vote for whoever can get our sewers cleaned up.” It is an obtuse offer of defiance.At the intersection of Garhwali and Jai Jaiwanti villages, it is possible that Vinesh’s caravan met with that of Captain Yogesh Bairagi. A former serviceman, Bairagi is the BJP candidate, a late announcement that caught many in the region by surprise. Many local BJP supporters admit that it is a 50-50 battle, pointing out that Bairagi had done good work in neighbouring Safidoh, organising employment camps.When one of them hears that the correspondent is from the Capital, he discreetly inquires if there are any jobs available.","Vinesh Phogat is contesting from village Julana in Haryana assembly elections.

Constitution amendments

NEW DELHI: The Modi government on Wednesday kicked off the exercise to implement its ' One Nation One Election ' promise by 2029, accepting the proposals of a high-level panel headed by former President Ramnath Kovind . The move will need support from opposition and non-NDA parties to push amendments to the Constitution, for which three ministers have been tasked to coordinate with political parties.The amendments may be introduced as early as the winter session of Parliament, sources said.Although home minister Amit Shah had Tuesday reaffirmed govt's intent to implement the move within the current term of Modi government, few had expected matters to move so swiftly, given NDA's lack of numbers in Parliament and the stated position of oppositon parties, who had among them enough strength to thwart the move.With the Union Cabinet clearing the proposal for 'One Nation, One Election' on Wednesday, PM Narendra Modi said synchronising elections to the Lok Sabha and state assemblies was an imperative which could not be dodged indefinitely.""This is an important step towards making our democracy even more vibrant and participative,"" Modi wrote on X while complimenting the Kovind committee.The plan envisages a two-stage transition - the first, involving simultaneous polls for Lok Sabha and state assemblies, will need an amendment to the Constitution, which will need to be ratified by both Houses of Parliament with two-thirds majority.To implement the second step - holding elections to local bodies within 100 days of general elections - a second Constitutional amendment will be required, which will need to be ratified by at least half the states.When the panel's recommendations were submitted, BJP enjoyed absolute majority in Lok Sabha, and could have reached the two-thirds threshold for a Constitutional amendment by deploying manoeuvres to find support from unlikely quarters.But with the arithmetic changed after the Lok Sabha polls, Modi will have to depend on allies and others to push the amendments in the Lower House.NDA allies are standing by the decision. More importantly, Samajwadi Party diverged from its ally Congress's outright rejection of the move to demand an all-party meeting to evolve consensus. BSP reversed its earlier opposition to support the idea, although this would be of no consequence given its lack of representation in the two Houses.During consultations with the Kovind panel, 32 political parties had supported the plan, with 15 opposing it, including Congress, Samajwadi Party, AAP, DMK, Trinamool and the Left.Govt remains hopeful of finding support. ""Govt will hold discussions across the country, and among different groups. Our govt believes in consensus. There will be more high-level deliberations,"" I&B minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said after the Cabinet meeting, where the PM is learnt to have emphasised the need to spread awareness about the gains - savings for the exchequer, relief from the pauses in decision-making minimising election fatigue, improved governance and stability and consistency in policies, likely to follow from holding elections together.Three ministers - Rajnath Singh, Kiren Rijiju and Arjun Ram Meghwal - will consult with political parties to build support for the plan, sources said.Cabinet ministers were of the view that an extensive nationwide campaign will be launched to sensitise stakeholders about the need to hold simultaneous polls and also create pressure on the naysayers.But before moving the amendments, govt will constitute an implementation group that will further work on the proposal. Separately, Election Commission and state chief election officers will have to work on common electoral rolls.Once the amendments are undertaken, the President will notify the ""appointed date"" for holding simultaneous polls. The tenure of state assemblies will expire from the appointed date. This means that the tenure of several state assemblies will be curtailed.In the case of state assemblies getting dissolved on account of no-confidence motion or a hung House, fresh elections will be held along with Lok Sabha polls.As far back as 1999, the law commission, and subsequently a Parliamentary panel in 2015, had also supported simultaneous elections.","PM Narendra Modi said synchronising elections to the Lok Sabha and state assemblies was an imperative which could not be dodged indefinitely. Three ministers - Rajnath Singh, Kiren Rijiju and Arjun Ram Meghwal - will consult with political parties to build support for the plan.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113469661,imgsize-510220,width-400,resizemode-4/113469661.jpg"
"With bail stirring suspicion, all eyes on Engineer's impact",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/with-bail-stirring-suspicion-all-eyes-on-engineers-impact/articleshow/113471530.cms,"SRINAGAR/ANANTNAG: This election, Kashmir is an alphabet soup, and adding to the traditional PDP/NC binary are AIP, AP, JEI, DPAP. The ubiquitous chatter in the middle of this muddle is the conspiracy theory about the ""invisible hand of Delhi"". And at the centre of these intrigues sits Engineer Rashid of Awami Ittehad Party .Jailed for over five years from where he won the 2024 Lok Sabha election but bailed out just in the nick of time to campaign for assembly polls , Rashid is a maverick who has roiled Kashmir politics like few have in the past.To his backers, he is the man who did not bend to Modi's will, but to others that includes the Abdullahs and the Muftis, he is the proxy sent by BJP to damage the Kashmiri regional parties and scramble the board. Kashmir is wracking its brain over who is Engineer and what he will manage. His damage potential will be a key story of the Kashmir outcome on October 8.Amid the hullabaloo, the scrawny visage that hides a shrill tone and sharp tongue shoots a mischievous half grin and fires back at TOI, ""I was put in Tihar on August 9, 2019, after the revocation of statehood, and remained there till September 11, 2024. But they (Omar Abdullah, Mehbooba Mufti, Farooq, Sajjad Lone) were treated as VVIP guests in five-star hotels. It is strange they are accusing me of being the Centre's pawn.""That is the rebuttal Rashid recites ad nauseum, his calling card positioning himself as the untainted one. But Kashmir is agog with why Rashid, not bailed for fighting the LS polls and to later attend Parliament, was suddenly ""let loose"" to campaign. The theory is that Engineer, with his native appeal on sensitive issues that target PM Modi, will wean away voters from NC-Congress and PDP who are vowing arm's length from BJP, and create a more friendly post-poll tally for BJP. The threat has alarmed the mainstream.Engineer laughs at this. ""I defeated Omar from jail in Baramulla LS polls by over two lakh votes, and Mehbooba lost heavily in Anantnag. And they are calling me vote-cutters. It is a unique case.""Yet, a veteran observer of local politics, not wishing to be named, gave an alternative view: Jail generated sympathy for Engineer in the LS polls and bail has generated suspicions in the assembly contest. ""He may not do as much harm as is being speculated,"" he estimates.Engineer claimed the propaganda by Omar and Mehbooba will only benefit him. ""Yeh jo public hai, sab jaanti hai (People know everything). I am in jail for 5.5 years and traitors, puppets, rubber stamps of New Delhi are accusing me. People know it.""Besides the bail, there are questions about the well-funded campaign of AIP's 34 candidates, its sudden alliance with the banned Jamaat-e-Islami that surprised all by, out of the blue, deciding to contest the polls backing and fielding Independents. Kashmir is particularly prone to doubts about "" Delhi's hand "" because PDP defector Altaf Bukhari's Apni Party and later Ghulam Nabi Azad's DPAP could never shrug off the tag of being BJP's proxies. With the two seen as having failed to realise their ""potential"", Engineer's election-eve bail helped the mainstream players to stoke the fire that AIP is BJP's final play.But the AIP chief is clear in his mind. ""I don't want to belittle myself by responding to their accusations,"" he said.",Engineer Rashid is a maverick who has roiled Kashmir politics like few have in the past. Kashmir is wracking its brain over who is Engineer and what he will manage. His damage potential will be a key story of the Kashmir outcome on October 8.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113471602,imgsize-1336118,width-400,resizemode-4/113471602.jpg"

59% turnout in first phase of J&K assembly polls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/59-turnout-in-first-phase-of-jk-assembly-polls/articleshow/113468798.cms,"Peaceful polling amid high security

JAMMU/SRINAGAR: The first phase of the three-part J&K assembly elections recorded a voter turnout of 59% across 24 constituencies Wednesday, covering seven districts in south Kashmir and Jammu division on either side of the Pir Panjal range.The voting process proceeded peacefully amid high security, according to J&K’s chief electoral officer PK Pole, and the final turnout could slightly increase once data from remote areas and postal ballots are included.“Today’s voting percentage is higher than previous elections held in 2009, 2014, and 2024 (Lok Sabha), and 2008 and 2014 (assembly),” Pole said, expressing satisfaction with the voter engagement in 16 constituencies of south Kashmir districts, traditionally known for low turnout. “I am sure that in the next two phases, the voting percentage will be much higher than today,” he said in Jammu city.However, the turnout was lower than the 71% recorded in the first of the five phases of elections held a decade ago. In 2014, the total turnout was nearly 66%, but the assembly’s strength was 87 then, including four seats from Ladakh. This was the highest polling percentage in 25 years despite calls by Hurriyat leaders like Syed Ali Shah Geelani and Mirwaiz Umar Farooq to boycott the elections.The 2024 assembly elections are the first in 10 years and since the abrogation of Article 370 in Aug 2019 and the bifurcation of the region into Union territories — J&K and Ladakh. Following the 2023 delimitation exercise, the assembly now has 90 seats, with 47 representatives from Kashmir and 43 from Jammu.The delimitation exercise ensured that no constituency straddles two districts, allowing for clearer district-wise figures this time, Pole said. Voter turnout varied across districts. In south Kashmir, Kulgam district recorded 61%, while Pulwama had the lowest with 46%. In the Jammu division, districts like Kishtwar saw 77%, the highest recorded in the region. Inderwal assembly segment in Jammu recorded an impressive 80% turnout.In Redwani village of Kulgam’s Devsar constituency, which had previously been a hotbed for separatist activities, voters lined up in large numbers. Mahak Irfan, a 22-year-old first-time voter, said: “Boycott has given us nothing. We need someone to change the current dynamics and protect our rights.”Local concerns, such as access to electricity and water resources, were central to voter sentiment. Abdul Rahim Dar of Devsar said: “Despite having our own power resources, we have to purchase electricity from outside. Now they’re saying that water will also be prepaid.”Kulgam constituency saw CPM leader Mohammad Yousuf Tarigami contesting for a fifth consecutive term. He is facing stiff competition from nine other candidates, including independent candidate Talat Majid Alie — a former member of the banned Jamaat-e-Islami.Tarigami’s supporters, such as Manzoor Ahmad, highlighted his achievements: “This vote is for his bold stand against the abrogation of Article 370. Tarigami always raised his voice against the revocation of the special status of Kashmir.”In Dooru, AICC general secretary Ghulam Ahmad Mir of the NC-Congress alliance is also facing a tough challenge with the entry of former separatists as independents. Mir, who had won the seat in 2002 and 2008, narrowly lost by 161 votes in 2014 to PDP’s Syed Farooq Ahmad Andrabi. Similar tight margins were seen in Gurez and Kupwara, where candidates won by razor-thin differences — 141 and 151 votes, respectively.The Jammu region’s eight constituencies saw strong voter enthusiasm, with long queues at polling stations in Doda, Kishtwar, and Ramban districts, which have been reeling from terrorist violence this summer.Former J&K Congress chief Vikar Rasool Wani expressed confidence in his party’s chances despite a “friendly fight” with ally NC in Banihal. “We will win. Mark my words,” he said after casting his vote at Tulbagh-Rallu polling station. “It is not a friendly contest as they (NC) have criticised and abused us continuously.”BJP’s Shagun Parihar, whose father and uncle were killed by terrorists in 2018, also expressed confidence after casting her vote in Kishtwar’s Mohalla Bagwan polling booth. “BJP will form the next govt in J&K,” said the 29-year-old, who is facing NC’s Sajjad Ahmed Kitchloo and PDP’s Firdous Ahmed Tak.However, polling was briefly halted in the booth following complaints of “bogus” voting, where Shagun was allegedly heckled by PDP and NC workers. “I was taunted by NC-PDP workers that I am playing the victim card and trying to gain sympathy.” PDP’s Tak later claimed he was assaulted by a police officer and accused Shagun of trying to disrupt the peaceful voting process.For Kashmiri Pandits, special polling stations were set up in Jammu, Udhampur, and Delhi to facilitate voting for over 35,000 displaced voters. “Free transport from designated locations was provided to them,” an official said.Voting for 26 seats will be held in the second phase on Sept 25, followed by 40 seats in the final round on Oct 1. Votes will be counted on Oct 8.",The first phase of the three-part J&K assembly elections recorded a voter turnout of 59% across 24 constituencies. This was the highest polling percentage in 25 years despite calls by Hurriyat leaders like Syed Ali Shah Geelani and Mirwaiz Umar Farooq to boycott the elections.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113468824,imgsize-1709765,width-400,resizemode-4/113468824.jpg"
"Article 370, statehood restoration J&K poll issues now, not 'azadi'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/valley-poll-vibes-shift-azadi-cry-gives-way-to-calls-for-370-statehood-return/articleshow/113436076.cms,"SRINAGAR: “Azadi (freedom)” and greater autonomy, stirring slogans of Kashmir Valley in earlier elections, have given way to calls for restoration of special status under Article 370 and statehood ahead of J&K’s Sept 18-Oct 1 assembly polls.In a sign of the change, National Conference (NC) president and ex-CM Farooq Abdullah vowed Monday to fight for the return of special status and move the Supreme Court again.The Centre had revoked the special status in Aug 2019 and the top court had upheld the decision in Dec 2023.Farooq was speaking in Ganderbal, one of two assembly seats from where his son and ex-CM Omar Abdullah is in the fray. The other seat is Budgam.As “Azadi” and autonomy slogans fade, J&K’s two major regional parties, Farooq’s NC and Mehbooba Mufti ’s PDP, have focused their campaigns largely on taunting adversaries as covert allies of “BJP” or as those “sponsored by BJP/RSS”.In Ganderbal, Farooq accused Awami Ittehad Party (AIP), led by Baramulla MP Sheikh Abdul Rasheed alias Engineer Rasheed, of having adjustments with Independents backed by the banned Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI). “They are their ( BJP ’s) products. Tell me why he (Rashid) was released a few days before elections. But people are aware of such tactics,” Farooq said.Rasheed was recently released for campaigning on interim bail from Delhi’s Tihar jail where he has been lodged in a terror funding case. Rasheed had defeated Omar in the Baramulla seat in this summer’s LS elections. “Rasheed has been sent to divide Muslims,” Farooq said, repeatedly questioning the timing of his release.According to the NC chief, those who once spoke about ushering in “Nizam-e-Mustafa (Islamic Rule)” are now hand in glove with BJP. “NC did not create separatism. They were talking about Pakistan and raising slogans in their favour. However, they have joined BJP now,” Farooq said in a swipe at separatist elements contesting the polls.Accusations of alignment with BJP/RSS drives voters away from such parties or candidates in the Muslim-dominated Valley. APNI party of Altaf Bukhari and Peoples Conference of Sajad Lone have suffered a dent in popularity due to claims of links with BJP. Congress breakaway leader Ghulam Nabi Azad’s Democratic Progressive Azad Party is hardly visible, not in the Valley, nor in Jammu division’s Chenab Valley where Muslim voters outnumber others.Mehbooba’s PDP also carries the baggage of proximity to BJP as the two had come together in a govt after the 2014 assembly polls -- the last such elections in J&K. This time, Mehbooba is trying hard to shake off the perception by slamming BJP for revoking Article 370 and ending statehood.Farooq’s NC had also partnered BJP when son Omar became a minister in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA govt over two decades ago. However, with time, political analysts believe NC has shed the perception of proximity to BJP.On its part, BJP is striving to overcome its image of a party confined to the Hindu-dominated Jammu region. PM Narendra Modi is likely to address a rally in Srinagar in the coming weeks. Union home minister Amit Shah has been already there on the ground, addressing rallies in Jammu and holding party meetings.",National Conference (NC) president and ex-CM Farooq Abdullah vowed Monday to fight for the return of special status and move the Supreme Court again. The Centre had revoked the special status in Aug 2019 and the top court had upheld the decision in Dec 2023.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113447829,imgsize-1628528,width-400,resizemode-4/113447829.jpg"

NEW DELHI: AAP Rajya Sabha MP Swati Maliwal on Wednesday upped the ante against her own party as she sharpened her attack on Delhi minister Atishi , who outgoing CM Arvind Kejriwal chose as his successor on Tuesday.Continuing her criticism of AAP's decision to pick Aitish as the next Delhi CM , disgruntled Maliwal claimed that Aitishi's parents ""had close ties with Syed Abdul Rahman Geelani "", one of the accused in the 2001 Parliament attack Maliwal took a ""god protect Delhi"" dig at Atishi, claiming that Atishi's parents also attended a programme organised by Geelani in memory of Afzal Guru at Delhi's Press Club.""Atishi Marlena's parents had close ties with SAR Geelani. Geelani was accused of having a hand in the attack on Parliament. In 2016, he organised a programme in the memory of Afzal Guru at the Press Club of Delhi. Atishi Marlena's parents were with Gilani on stage in that programme,"" the AAP MP wrote.Malwai further claimed: ""Slogans were raised in this programme - 'If one Afzal dies, lakhs will be born'., 'Kashmir demands freedom'. Atishi Marlena's parents have written an article titled 'Arrest and torture of Syed Geelani'.

Swati Maliwal is a person who takes the ticket to Rajya Sabha from AAP but takes the script to react from BJP. If she has even a little shame, she should resign as a Rajya Sabha MP and choose the path to Rajya Sabha on a BJP ticket. If she wants to be in Rajya Sabha, she should get ticket from BJP,"" Dilip Pandey told news agency ANI.The relations between Maliwal and AAP went downhill after the former alleged that she was assaulted by Kejriwal's close aide Bibhav Kumar at CM's house.Earlier this month, however, the Supreme Court granted bail to Bibhav Kumar in the case. The apex court noted that Kumar had been in custody for 100 days and that a chargesheet was already filed in the case.The court also directed that Bibhav Kumar should not be reinstated as the personal assistant or given any official assignment in the CM office.","Maliwal claims Aitish's parents ""had close ties with Syed Abdul Rahman Geelani"" AAP leader Dilip Pandey said if she had even ""little shame left"", she should resign as Rajya Sabha MP and instead ""get a BJP ticket"" The relations between Maliwal and AAP went downhill after the former alleged she was assaulted by Kejriwal's close aide Bibhav Kumar.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113451901,imgsize-893417,width-400,resizemode-4/113451901.jpg"

Surname controversy

NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Tuesday announced Delhi minister Atishi the successor of incumbent CM Arvind Kejriwal , who on Sunday declared that he would step down from the post within two days.While addressing a Sunday's rally CM Kejriwal, out on bail in an alleged liquor policy scam , announced that he would seek a ""certificate of honesty"" from the Delhi voters and that till then he would not be the CM of the national capital.After Kejriwal's announcement, speculations on the name of his possible successor floated Delhi's political spectrum for two days, with Aitish being the front-runner for the CM post.According to reports, Atishi's name was also proposed at the Political Affairs Committee (PAC) meeting held at Arvind Kejriwal's residence last night. Her name was proposed, and a consensus was agreed upon by party members.Atishi, one of the close political confidants of Kejriwal, held several important portfolios in government while the party's top leaders, including Manish Sisodia and Arvind Kejriwal, were in jail in the excise scam case.Atishi's responsibilities include finance, planning, PWD, water, power, education, higher education, services and publicity. Since the party's formation, she has made substantial contributions to its expansion and progress.Atishi, born on June 8, 1981, was raised in an academic household in Delhi. Her parents, Vijay Singh and Tripta Wahi, both hold positions as professors at Delhi University.Atishi did her undergraduation from Delhi University's St. Stephen's College. She then received a Chevening scholarship, which allowed her to further her studies at the University of Oxford. There, she completed her master's programme. Later, as a Rhodes scholar, Atishi attended Magdalen College in Oxford in 2005.In AAP since 2012, Marlena has played a key role in the party and government since the chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal, appointed her advisor to deputy CM Manish Sisodia, primarily for education.Party functionaries highlight that her importance was evident when Kejriwal, while in jail, proposed that Atishi would hoist the national flag on his behalf at the Delhi government's Independence Day function.However, lieutenant governor V K Saxena nominated Minister Kailash Gahlot for the task instead. As the MLA representing Kalkaji assembly constituency, Atishi has been at the forefront of the party's communication efforts and has taken the lead in addressing crucial issues such as the Delhi water dispute with neighbouring states.She has been vocal on day-to-day party affairs and in taking on BJP and LG.Since the party's formation, Atishi has made substantial contributions to its expansion and progress, playing a critical role as a key member of the manifesto drafting committee for the 2013 assembly elections and formulating the party's objectives and vision.In 2018, Atishi, who was AAP's candidate for the East Delhi Lok Sabha seat, dropped her 'Marlena' surname from her Twitter handle and also from all publicity material after a whisper campaign, allegedly by the BJP, that she is a Christian.She said that she wanted to ""stop the BJP from polarizing the election"".Her Twitter (now X) handle, @AtishiMarlena, has been changed to @AtishiAAP.The official website of the party now reflects the change.Atishi, a Punjabi Rajput, was given the title ""Marlena"" by her parents as a tribute to communist icons Marx and Lenin.Rebutting the BJP’s charge that AAP was engaging in caste politics to gain an advantage in elections, the party asserted that dropping Marlena was Atishi’s own decision.","Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Tuesday announced Delhi minister Atishi the successor of incumbent CM Arvind Kejriwal.

In a democracy, however, it's the people's right to make their choice,"" he added.Pawar also addressed discussions on potential constitutional changes, including curbing reservations and implementing a common civil code.

He added, ""I am among those leaders too."" However, Pawar highlighted that becoming chief minister requires a majority of 145 seats, which depends on the voters' choice.
