"Compared to BJP, Congress falls short in seat-sharing bargain",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/compared-to-bjp-congress-falls-short-in-seat-sharing-bargain/articleshow/114751671.cms,"NAGPUR: As the final nominations are in, it has become clear that Congress has failed to secure enough seats on the MVA bargaining table. Congress managed to eke out around 100 seats in the MVA alliance. In comparison, BJP walked away with around 150 in the seat-sharing haggling match within the Mahayuti.While it's clear that Congress is way off the mark, opinion is divided as to who is responsible for it. Last week, reports surfaced that Congress' Rahul Gandhi had chided state-level functionaries for a poor seat-sharing deal, though these reports were denied by the party.A Vidarbha-based Congress neta said the bargaining game was lost by his party because of two reasons. ""First, the internal differences within our state leaders. Second reason was that unlike the Mahayuti, our two regional allies are extremely hard bargainers with a hotline to our high command,"" he added.""Both NCP (SP) & Sena (UBT) have direct access to Congress high command. Sharad Pawar, for obvious reasons, was able to speak anytime with our decision-makers whenever bargaining became too hot,"" the neta said.""At the same time, Sena Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut can apparently dial in Rahul Gandhi at any point, thus making local functionaries redundant in case of a deadlock,"" said the neta. He added that in Mahayuti, neither Ajit Pawar nor Eknath Shinde can directly call PM Modi or Amit Shah, and that went in favour of BJP's state unit during bargaining sessions.Another Nagpur-based leader, who is also an ex-minister, said Congress netas from western Maharashtra scuttled some hard bargaining by state president Nana Patole and LoP Vijay Wadettiwar. ""Patole has an alpha-male type personality, and that is reflected in the bargaining talks for seats. He was driving a hard bargain for seats. While he may not always be right, ultimately it was important for the party to stick together,"" he added.",Congress managed to eke out around 100 seats in the MVA alliance.

Nawab Malik back on NCP ticket against Mahayuti pick,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nawab-malik-back-on-ncp-ticket-against-mahayuti-pick/articleshow/114751562.cms,"MUMBAI: In a major embarrassment for the Mahayuti, former minister Nawab Malik who faces a money laundering probe, filed his nomination papers as a candidate of the Ajit Pawar-led NCP in Mankhurd-Shivajinagar. This creates a peculiar situation within the Mahayuti alliance because the Shiv Sena has also fielded a candidate from the same seat.A month ago when Malik declared he would contest as an NCP nominee from Shivajinagar, the BJP leadership comprising deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis , state BJP chief Chandrashekhar Bawankule and his Mumbai counterpart Ashish Shelar had expressed disapproval, arguing that he was accused of links with the underworld and Dawood Ibrahim.Significantly, after poll dates were declared and NCP shortlisted its nominees, Malik was given the authorisation form by the party, but the decision was not made public. On Tuesday, he first submitted his nomination as an independent candidate before the returning officer in Mankhurd. After a few hours, he submitted another form as an NCP nominee.Malik said the NCP's decision reflects the leadership's confidence in him.""I am not bothered by opposition to my candidature. I am thankful to Pawar, Praful Patel, and Sunil Tatkare for expressing confidence in me,"" Malik told TOI. Malik said he was confident of his victory as well as of his daughter Sana from neighbouring Anushaktinagar constituency. ""I am sure my daughter and I will win in the elections despite the presence of several rebels in both constituencies,"" Malik said.Shelar reacted saying ""BJP will not campaign for Malik. Accordingly, instructions have been given to our grassroots level workers.""On Malik's daughter Sana Malik, Shelar said until any evidence or information comes to light, the alliance candidate is the BJP candidate as well.Mankhurd is a stronghold of the Samajwadi Party, and has been represented by Abu Azmi for three consecutive terms. In the last election, he won against a Sena candidate, which is the reason the Sena was officially allocated the seat this time.Malik who is also a three-term MLA, was a minister in the MVA govt. He was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act on Feb 23, 2022. Malik was granted bail on medical grounds in July this year. The Shiv Sena's Suresh Patil, known as 'Bullet Patil', is the official Sena candidate here.",Former minister Nawab Malik faces a money laundering probe. He filed his nomination papers as a candidate of the Ajit Pawar-led NCP. This creates a peculiar situation within the Mahayuti alliance. The Shiv Sena has also fielded a candidate from the same seat.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114751662,imgsize-1115077,width-400,resizemode-4/114751662.jpg"

"Close to 150 rebels in Maharashtra poll fray, pose challenge to MVA & Mahayuti",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/close-to-150-rebels-in-maharashtra-poll-fray-pose-challenge-to-mva-mahayuti/articleshow/114750421.cms,"MUMBAI/NAGPUR: Rebels threatened to become a headache for the two major alliances in the state as nominations for the assembly polls drew to a close Tuesday. While Mahayuti identified 80 rebels, close to 150 politicians in all from across parties have filed nominations in defiance of their party's, or multi-party alliance's, official candidates. With Nov 4 being the last date for withdrawing nominations, the fronts have nearly a week to sort out differences and persuade rebels to pull out of the fray.Both the MVA and the Mahayuti said they had declared candidates for all 288 seats.After nominations closed, MVA had accounted for 286 of its nominees filing papers (103 from Congress - final figure for that party - 96 from Sena-UBT and 87 from Sharad Pawar-led NCP), with the three parties giving seats from their own quotas to smaller allies. In Mahayuti, the count came to 284 (BJ, Shiv Sena 80 and NCP 52), including smaller allies. Both alliances said the remaining seats would be accounted for once information came in from various parts of the state. However, from Mahayuti list, it appears it has declared two candidates in 5 constituencies, and none in two seats; it has declared 289 candidates in all.Among the prominent rebels are BJP's Gopal Shetty from Borivli who has filed papers against his party's official candidate Sanjay Upadhyay and NCP minister Chhagan Bhujbal's nephew Sameer, who has filed his nomination as an independent candidate from Nandgaon assembly constituency in Nashik district against Shiv Sena MLA Suhas Kande.Prominent netas of Mahayuti and MVA admitted that the presence of rebels in the fray is a cause for concern and that they would have to tackle the matter. There is time still to do that: papers of candidates will be scrutinised on Wednesday and Nov 4 is the last date for withdrawal of candidatures. After that, a clear picture will emerge on the number of rebels still left in the fray.While the confusion that prevailed for a fortnight over who would contest how many seats more or less ended on Tuesday, significantly the Mahayuti, despite several rounds of talks, kept its seat-sharing formula secret throughout, while MVA's formula kept changing publicly. Initially, it was proposed that Congress would contest 103 seats, UBT Shiv Sena 90, and NCP (SP) 85. Later, UBT Sena MP Sanjay Raut proposed a formula of 85 seats each, and since there was no consensus on that, Congress legislature party leader Balasaheb Thorat proposed a new formula, where all constituents of MVA would contest 90 seats each. The dispute was then taken to the court of the AICC, followed by separate meetings with Sharad Pawar and Uddhav Thackeray, after which the issue was resolved. ""There was no fixed formula; seats were decided based on merit and the winnability factor,"" a senior Congress politician said.State NCP president Sunil Tatkare said the seat-sharing formula of the Mahayuti was decided after considering all factors. ""We took note of the winnability factor. I am sure that the Mahayuti will retain power in the state,"" he said. Tatkare has convened a meeting of all senior leaders of his party on Wednesday to take stock of the political situation. ""We will meet our senior leaders to resolve intra-party disputes,"" Tatkare said.Mumbai BJP chief Ashish Shelar was also confident of Mahayuti's win, saying selection of candidates was purely on merit and their ability to deliver and to tackle problems faced by the people. ""We will lead once again,"" Shelar said. Shelar felt the political picture in the state would be clear after the last date of withdrawal of nominations. ""We will know the exact number of candidates in the fray after the last date of withdrawal,"" he said.AICC secretary Ramesh Chennithala said that the people of Maharashtra would reject the ""corrupt"" Mahayuti govt led by Eknath Shinde.","Close to 150 politicians in all from across parties have filed nominations in defiance of their party's official candidates.

Any notice issued will be withdrawn,"" Siddaramaiah added.On reports of similar notices being issued to farmers in Chitradurga, Yadgir and Dharwad, the CM said he would instruct the revenue minister to investigate further. ""Farmers will not be evicted anywhere,"" the CM reiterated.Sharing copies on X, Patil said notices were served to farmers in Vijayapura by Waqf Board during the previous BJP govt between 2019 and 2022. ""They are promoting a 'fake pro-Hindutva' stance through misinformation. They misled people with issues like hijab, halal, and Urigowda-Nanjegowda while in office, and are continuing with the same tactics. Their attempts to deceive the public with fabricated narratives will not work anymore,"" he asserted.On notices issued to farmers on over 1,200 acres in Honavada of Tikota taluk marked as Waqf property, Patil had clarified on Monday that it was due to an ""error"" in the gazette notification. He confirmed that only 11 acres are actually Waqf property. To resolve the issue, he announced the formation of a task force led by the deputy commissioner.Earlier, BJP state president Vijayendra criticised the Congress govt, warning of severe consequences if the Waqf board proceeds with acquisition of farmers' land. ""We stand with farmers. What will farmers do if ancestral property, passed down through generations, is declared Waqf property overnight? Our fact-finding committee, led by Chitradurga MP Govind Karjol, has reached Vijayapura, and once they submit the report we'll decide on the future course of action,"" Vijayendra added.Union minister Pralhad Joshi criticised state govt and called for suspension of tahsildars who had issued notices to farmers and demanded accountability.","Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah assured farmers Tuesday that no one would be evicted from their property.

The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections , which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases. The results will be declared on November 23, along with Maharashtra.In the Tribal-dominated state, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and CM Hemant's Soren Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) are in a direct fight, while the Congress party and Lalu Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) are in alliance with the JMM.The JMM-Congress-RJD alliance are also reportedly seeking to deal with Left parties, Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party and other tribal outfits that have been contesting the elections in the state as independent entities and make efforts to field candidates against the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) on all 81 seats collectively.In the last assembly polls in 2019, the JMM-Congress-RJD alliance won a comfortable majority of 47 seats in a House of 81.The BJP slipped to 25 seats from 37 it held in 2014. The poor performance was perceived to be the outcome of its decision to contest alone backfiring. The party did not foster an alliance with the Ajsu in the 2019 polls when Raghubar Das, currently the Odisha governor, was serving the state as CM.In this year's Lok Sabha polls in Jharkhand, the BJP-led NDA secured nine out of the 14 seats, with the BJP winning eight and its alliance partner, the Ajsu (All Jharkhand Students Union) Party, retaining its single seat.On the other hand, the opposition India bloc improved its tally, increasing its seat count from two in 2019 to five in the parliamentary polls.BJP and JMM have spruced up their pace of campaigning from the ground zero to social media. BJP and JMM leaders are actively rebutting and challenging each other on a range of issues, including illegal immigration, youth welfare, employment and housing.INDIA bloc parties in Jharkhand slammed the EC for holding assembly elections in the state along with that of Maharashtra but claimed that they were ready to slug it out with BJP-led NDA, which has welcomed the announcement of poll dates.JMM, Congress, and CPI (ML-L) said the announcement showed that EC was in a hurry to conduct elections though the assembly tenure was due to end in January next year.Also, both the INDIA bloc and BJP-led NDA are expected to get into huddles to discuss the modalities of seat-sharing which is going to be a challenge for both the competing teams.","The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections, which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra. Elections in Maharashtra will be held in single phase on November 20. The counting of votes will be on November 23.Maharashtra is gearing up for elections as the two major political alliances—the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) and the Mahayuti—prepare to face each other for the first time in a Vidhan Sabha election.The Maha Vikas Aghadi, comprise of the Congress, the Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray), and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) under Sharad Pawar, will go head-to-head with the Mahayuti , which includes the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Shiv Sena faction led by Eknath Shinde, and the NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar. This will be the first electoral contest between these two alliances since the splits within the Shiv Sena and NCP.The MVA is hopeful of replicating its recent Lok Sabha success, while the Mahayuti aims to retain power by leveraging its populist schemes targeted at women and youth. Both alliances have set their sights on winning the state.Narayan Rane, a former Union Minister and the victor in the Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg Lok Sabha constituency, is poised to be a key figure for the BJP in the Konkan region during the forthcoming elections. Meanwhile, two constituencies are expected to be critical battlegrounds: chief minister Eknath Shinde's Kopri-Pachpakdi seat in Thane City and Worli in Mumbai, where Aaditya Thackeray, a leader of the Shiv Sena (UBT), is seeking reelection.In the last Vidhan Sabha elections in 2019, the BJP secured 26.1% of the votes, the Congress 16.1%, the NCP 16.9%, and the Shiv Sena 16.6%. The BJP and the Shiv Sena (then united) formed the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which secured a majority. However, the coalition soon crumbled due to disagreements over government formation, plunging the state into a political crisis.After no party could establish a government, Maharashtra was placed under President's rule. Devendra Fadnavis was briefly sworn in as chief minister, with Ajit Pawar as deputy chief minister. However, both resigned just days later before a scheduled floor test.By November 28, 2019, a new coalition emerged, with the Shiv Sena (Uddhav faction), NCP (Sharad Pawar faction), and Congress forming the Maha Vikas Aghadi government, led by Uddhav Thackeray as chief minister.The state's politics took another turn in June, 2022, when Uddhav Thackeray resigned following a rebellion within the Shiv Sena, led by Eknath Shinde, who then allied with the BJP. Eknath Shinde assumed the role of chief minister, with Devendra Fadnavis returning as deputy chief minister.",The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra. Elections in Maharashtra will be held in single phase on November 20. The counting of votes will be on November 23. This will be the first electoral contest between these two alliances since the splits within the Shiv Sena and NCP.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114248739,imgsize-47642,width-400,resizemode-4/114248739.jpg"
