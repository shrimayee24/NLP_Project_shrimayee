The opposition hit out at Atishi describing the gesture as a "" grave insult "" to constitutional norms and the role of chief minister.Atishi, who took office as Delhi's eighth chief minister, said she would serve a four-month term, likening her role to that of Bharat from the Ramayana, who ruled Ayodhya in Lord Ram's absence by placing his wooden slippers on the throne.Atishi placed an empty chair beside her CM chair and said, ""This chair belongs to Arvind Kejriwal. Today I took charge as the CM of Delhi. Today I have the same pain in my heart as Bharat ji had. Just like Bharat ji worked by keeping Lord Shri Ram's sandals, I will take charge as CM for the next four months.""Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva condemned Atishi's action, asserting it disrespected the position of chief minister and the sentiments of Delhi residents.""What she did was not ideal. Through her gesture, she has not only insulted the post of chief minister but also hurt the feelings of the people of Delhi. Arvind Kejriwal needs to answer whether he will run the government through a remote control,"" Sachdeva said.Delhi Congress chief Devender Yadav labeled Atishi as a ""dummy"" chief minister for keeping Kejriwal's chair vacant. Yadav expressed concern over the comparison of a figure recently jailed for corruption to Lord Ram, saying it undermined the dignity of the role.""I have a strong objection to this that a person who was in jail for a corruption case is being compared to Lord Ram. Atishi has crossed all limits and presented herself as a dummy chief minister,"" Yadav said.BJP MP Manoj Tiwari also criticised Atishi, claiming her empty chair gesture demonstrated that she is a "" puppet chief minister "" and an affront to the Constitution.""What is the meaning of an empty chair when there is a chief minister in the office? This act shows that she is a puppet CM and it is a grave insult to the Constitution. I am sure that the people of Delhi will take cognisance of it,"" Tiwari said.""How can someone compare a corrupt person who is out on bail to Lord Ram? Was Lord Ram accused of corruption? He was 'Maryada Purushottam' (the perfect man). These people (AAP) do not hesitate to degrade the Hindu gods. They continue to insult the Sanatan Dharma,” the BJP MP added.Atishi took office on September 22, following Kejriwal's resignation, and expressed confidence in his potential return in the upcoming assembly elections scheduled for February. She highlighted that the BJP has actively sought to damage Kejriwal's reputation, referencing his six-month incarceration and a court's statement about the agency's motives in his arrest.Atishi, 43, is the third woman to serve as chief minister of Delhi, following Sushma Swaraj and Sheila Dikshit.","Atishi likens her role to that of Bharat from the Ramayana, who ruled Ayodhya in Lord Ram's absence by placing his wooden slippers on the throne.

A tribal family fumes over its fief being made 'for STs only',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/a-tribal-family-fumes-over-its-fief-being-made-for-sts-only/articleshow/113614315.cms,"KANGAN (GANDERBAL): A tribal family was winning an assembly segment for seven decades before it was abruptly reserved for STs this year. Now, the family vehemently protests the decision as ""injustice"" to general voters, even as it fights to keep its post-Independence grip on the constituency going.If the instance boggles the mind, welcome to Kangan, nestling in the limitless beauty of pristine hills on one side and gurgling waters of ""nallah Sind"" on the other, with picturesque Sonmarg tantalizingly up the road.Mehar Ali, looking to replace his Lok Sabha MP father Mian Altaf Ahmad as local National Conference legislator, says, ""Reservation will hurt us. Kangan has larger general population than STs. The people here have been cheated.""He said NC members and the 2014 PDP candidate had met the Delimitation Commission during its visit and urged them that Kangan should not be reserved. ""Every person feels bad about it,"" he added.Interestingly, PDP's Bashir Mir who ran Ahmad close in 2014 is angry over seat's reservation and is now contesting from neighbouring Ganderbal.At the core of the debate is that after Independence, the Mian family, as the spiritual head of the Gujjar-Bakarwal communities headquartered in Babanagri village, has held sway over the vast populace spread from the border areas of Jammu to inside of Kashmir. In Kangan, tribals voted for the contestingMian family member over decades, while their personal and party appeal cut across the ST-general divide.Ahmad said the redrawing of seats in Ganderbal-Kangan was patently flawed. ""There was no need to convert it into an ST seat. We never sought political reservation. I am a five-term MLA and now MP, I never asked,"" he said.As Kangan and Ahmad family revealed, there comes a point in the complicated political game of selfish motivations that larger considerations trump the normal logic of identity politics.When asked why should a tribal not welcome his seat being tagged as ST reserved, the parliamentarian shot back, ""My grandfather became an MLA in 1951 till 1967. Then my father was MLA till 1987. I was there till the assembly was dissolved in 2018. I trust the people. Why should I want it to become an ST reserved seat? The general masses back me and my family."" He conceded that general population in Kangan may be 4% more than STs.Asserting that he has seen many delimitations over the years, Ahmad alleged the one carried out in J&K was done to suit BJP, with an increase in six seats in Jammu and one in Kashmir. He said the delimitation attached parts of Rajouri (Jammu) with Anantnag (Kashmir) in Lok Sabha, but people voted against BJP, and he won by over 2.5 lakh votes. ""But just imagine that people of Rajouri have to come to their MP in Anantnag on a routine basis taking the Mughal road,"" he remarked.Claimed he, ""It was done on BJP's advice, but BJP has got trapped in it now."" He also blamed PDP for the ""mess of delimitation"" because it tied up with BJP in 2014.""The ground is hostile to BJP because of delimitation. The people see NC as the alternative, even though they have no love for us,"" he said.","Tribal family was winning an assembly segment for seven decades before it was abruptly reserved for STs this year.
