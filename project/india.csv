NEW DELHI: Congress Friday lashed out at BJP for appointing N Ramchander Rao as its Telangana president, asking if the party has rewarded him for ""his leading role"" in the ""institutional murder"" of Dalit scholar Rohith Vemula in 2016. Congress demanded BJP withdraw the appointment and apologise to the country.Deputy CM Bhatti Vikramarka Mallu said Rao had taken ""goons"" to Hyderabad University and forced authorities to file a false case against Vemula, leading to harassment that ended with his suicide. Same time, Vikramarka said BJP has appointed M Susheel Kumar, who as a key ABVP member was allegedly involved in Vemula's harassment, as assistant professor in DU.Vikramarka also announced Congress govt had moved HC seeking a directive to reopen the Vemula case. The move comes nearly three months after Rahul Gandhi asked CM Revanth Reddy to enact a law against caste discrimination named after Vemula.","Congress demands BJP withdraw the appointment and apologise to the country.

'None of videos of stir show any obstruction was done by accused'

NEW DELHI: A protest for voicing a dissenting opinion ""is not only the hallmark of democracy but also a fundamental right"" guaranteed under the Constitution, a Delhi court on Thursday said.The observation was made by additional chief judicial magistrate Neha Mittal while discharging 10 TMC functionaries, including MPs Derek O'Brien, Sagarika Ghose and Saket Gokhale, in a case registered against them for their protest in April last year outside the ECI, despite prohibitory orders being in place under section 144 of CrPC.The ACJM said the question was whether the accused persons violated the prohibitory orders, which was a reasonable restriction on the said fundamental rights. There was nothing on record to show that the accused persons knew of the order issued by the ACP concerned, the court said.The Delhi court order was pronounced on Thursday, but a copy was made available on Friday. The other TMC members named in the matter were Mohammed Nadimul Haque, Dola Sen, Vivek Gupta, Arpita Ghosh, Santanu Sen, Abir Ranjan Biswas and Sudip Raha.The court said the prosecution could not establish that the gathering of the accused persons was an unlawful assembly , nor could it prove they were commanded to disperse because of prohibitory orders being promulgated. The police complaint, based on which the FIR was registered, did not state that any obstruction, annoyance, injury or danger to human life, health or safety was likely to take place because of the acts of the accused.""None of the videos of the protest show that any obstruction was indeed caused because of the acts of the accused persons,"" the court said, adding there was no disruption to traffic, nor the entry to the ECI building was blocked.","A protest for voicing a dissenting opinion is a fundamental right, a Delhi court says.

Siddaramaiah Dismisses CM Change Talks Amid Rising Buzz in Congress Circles

BENGALURU/NEW DELHI: Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah slammed the door Thursday on speculation about an imminent baton change with his deputy DK Shivakumar by declaring there was ""no vacancy"" at the top. He then threw down the gauntlet to any future challenger with the clincher: ""I will lead party in 2028 state polls too.""Siddaramaiah, seen as being on shaky ground ever since his wife was named as an alleged beneficiary of Muda land-swap scam, acknowledged Shivakumar's chief ministerial ambitions but said he was realistic enough to accept that Karnataka had ""a CM for the full term"".""I am very much here before you. I am the CM of Karnataka. That is what Shivakumar has said, and I am also saying it,"" he told reporters in Delhi. ""Shivakumar has never stated that the CM should be changed,"" he said.On few MLAs seeking a change and rooting for Shivakumar, the CM claimed their numbers were insignificant. ""Few MLAs may support him, majority don't."" Sidda said he and Shivakumar were answerable to party brass... that was how it should be.Shivakumar, too, is in Delhi, apparently waiting to meet party chief Mallikarjun Kharge and LS LoP Rahul Gandhi. Party insiders said Shivakumar was attempting to convince Siddaramaiah through Congress high command to accept a rotation formula for the chief ministership, as was the buzz when the party came to govt in 2023.","Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah slammed the door on speculation about an imminent baton change with his deputy DK Shivakumar.

Delhi Judge Cash Row: Modi Govt Likely To Move Impeachment Motion Against Justice Varma

Poll Do you support the impeachment of Justice Yashwant Varma for corruption charges? Yes, he should be impeached No, he should not be impeached

NEW DELHI: With government indicating that it will set up a statutory inquiry committee as part of impeachment proceedings of Justice Yashwant Varma contrary to its earlier stance, Congress is likely to support the move to sack the judge on corruption charges, even as it plans to use the platform to ""embarrass"" BJP for ignoring similar proceedings against another judge Shekhar Yadav over ""hate speech"".The push in Congress is to use impeachment proceedings to hammer at government's ""selective approach"" against judges. In a rare occurrence, twin impeachment proceedings are hanging fire simultaneously - Varma is facing the charge of corruption after the alleged recovery and burning of cash at his residence, while Allahabad high court judge Shekhar Yadav is in the firing line for his controversial comments about Uniform Civil Code.Interestingly, while central government has announced its intent to bring an impeachment motion against Varma, opposition last Dec filed an impeachment notice against Yadav for ""hate speech"" but govt has maintained silence on it.Senior lawyer and Congress MP Abhishek Singhvi said, ""There should be no double standards in the way govt seeks to approach Varma and Yadav cases. Selectivity and opportunism between the two cases is not good.Both deserve initiation of impeachment process. In Yadav case, govt has already dragged its feet long enough.""Congress sources said the party is expected to support impeachment of Varma in monsoon session of Parliament. Congress functionaries like Singhvi and Vivek Tankha had earlier targeted govt for planning to do away with the inquiry panel provided for in Judges Inquiry Act, and warned that the ""violation"" will lay grounds for Varma's discharge later.Now, sources said, government has since conveyed that it will set up an inquiry committee on Varma.However, a big issue for opposition is ""hate speech"" by Justice Yadav, for which its impeachment notice is pending. Modi govt has not given any indication on taking it up, despite public calls for it by Congress functionaries, and a letter by lawyer-MP Vivek Tankha to Rajya Sabha chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar.A senior Congress functionary said, ""We are not linking the two issues of impeachment. We will support the move to sack Varma, but we will use the platform to embarrass govt on its selective approach on accountability in the judiciary.""","Congress is likely to support the move to sack the judge on corruption charges.

HYDERABAD: Former minister and senior BRS leader T Harish Rao appeared before the Justice PC Ghose commission on Friday and submitted information available with him regarding the approvals and construction of the Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Scheme (KLIS).Later addressing the media, the former irrigation minister alleged that the Congress govt might be providing incorrect information to the commission regarding the Kaleswaram project.“I have provided the commission with all the information I have. Since we are no longer in power, all the documents are with the govt.

Harish Rao said that he had gathered all the information at his disposal and submitted it to the commission in the form of a detailed note, along with supporting documents.He clarified that the cabinet had taken decisions on the three barrages on six occasions, and these decisions were also ratified by the Assembly three times.He also provided the commission with details of when the Cabinet discussed the matter, notes from those discussions, and other relevant documents. Harish Rao emphasised that legislative approval carries more weight than the cabinet’s decisions, and shared details of the discussions that took place in the legislature.

Telangana BJP's Strategic Silence Following T Raja Singh's Resignation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/telangana-bjps-strategic-silence-following-t-raja-singhs-resignation/articleshow/122398866.cms,"



HYDERABAD: The Telangana BJP leadership approached the resignation of Goshamahal MLA T Raja Singh with calculated caution. While the firebrand leader’s departure had been anticipated, the timing, tone, and drama surrounding it prompted the state unit to tread cautiously.Just hours before the ofﬁcial announcement on Friday, Telangana BJP leaders were summoned for a closed-door strategy meeting, where newly-appointed state chief N Ramchander Rao instructed them to refrain from making any public statements until the central leadership issued formal communication. The message from Delhi was clear— maintain discipline, stay aligned with the central narrative, and project unity.“There were early signs in the morning, but the party chose to remain silent until the ofﬁcial letter was released by the central leadership,” a party insider revealed. “No one holds any personal animosity towards him (Singh),” he added.Later, party spokesperson Rani Rudrama addressed the media, offcially announcing the acceptance of Singh’s resignation. She was careful to underscore that there were no personal differences between Singh and any party leader and emphasised that the Telangana unit had only forwarded his resignation letter to the top brass in Delhi.“The decision was taken purely on disciplinary grounds by the central leadership,” she asserted.Party general secretary Venkateswarlu said: “This was Singh’s personal decision. The state leadership had no role in inﬂuencing it. We will stand by and implement whatever directives are issued by the central leadership.” Insiders said that drama unfolded the day Singh arrived at the party ofﬁce to submit his nomination papers for the state president’s post. His public criticism of the party reportedly infuriated senior BJP ﬁgures.“Singh’s statements crossed a line. It became too politically risky for the party to ignore his actions this time,” said a source.","The Telangana BJP leadership approached the resignation of Goshamahal MLA T Raja Singh with calculated caution.

BJP MLA Raja Singh Resignation Sparks Turmoil in Telangana Assembly,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/bjp-mla-raja-singh-resignation-sparks-turmoil-in-telangana-assembly/articleshow/122398896.cms,"



HYDERABAD: With BJP accepting firebrand leader Raja Singh’s resignation, speculation is rife over his status in the legislative assembly. Singh, who attempted to submit his nomination in deﬁ ance, had alleged that his candidacy for the election of state unit chief was “obstructed” by party senior leaders, including Union minister and election incharge Shobha Karandlaje.The Telangana BJP , however, quickly dismissed these accusations, asserting that Singh lacked the mandatory backing of 10 members from the state executive committee — a prerequisite for eligibility.In his letter to then BJP state chief and Union coal minister G Kishan Reddy , Singh questioned the central leadership’s decision to nominate Ramchander Rao to head BJP in Telangana. “This decision has come as a shock and disappointment not only to me but also to lakhs of karyakartas, leaders and voters who have stood by the party.At a time when BJP is on the threshold of forming its ﬁ rst govt in Telangana, such a choice (Ramchander Rao) raises serious doubts about the direction (in which) we are heading,” he wrote in the strongly-worded letter.Although the MLA has not submitted his resignation to the state assembly Speaker, his exit from the party leaves the status of his legislative seat in ambiguity. Sources in the party say it remains unclear whether the central leadership will forward his resignation to the Speaker or leave the decision to Singh.Singh’s estrangement from BJP has been growing steadily through his second term, especially due to reported tensions with Kishan Reddy.
