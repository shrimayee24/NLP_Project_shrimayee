"Madras High Court: Girl, 14, jumps off Madras high court building after it orders authorities to send her to govt shelter",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/custody-clash-ends-in-courtroom-shock-madras-hc-orders-shelter-home-stay-for-teen-she-jumps-from-1st-floor-minutes-later/articleshow/123272940.cms,"CHENNAI: Upset with a Madras high court order to send her to a govt home, a 14-year-old girl tried to escape from police by jumping from the court's first floor on Tuesday. She was in court to tell the judges whether she wanted to live with her divorced father or mother.Minutes after a division bench of Justices M S Ramesh and V Lakshminarayanan pronounced the order, the girl tried to escape by jumping off the first-floor corridor of Court No 5, clutching a wire. The girl, who suffered injuries due to the fall, was rescued by police and rushed to the Rajiv Gandhi Govt General Hospital (RGGGH) in an ambulance stationed in the court.The issue pertains to a complaint made by M K Nair with the Neelankarai police alleging that his daughter was missing. Since considerable time had lapsed and the girl could not be secured, he moved a habeas corpus plea in high court. During the pendency of the petition, the girl was traced and produced before the court.The bench was informed that the girl had gone to her grandmother's house in the Andamans and was residing with her since she did not want to live with either her father or mother, who are divorced and living separately.In view of the wish expressed by the minor girl, the court subjected her to counselling before the Tamil Nadu Mediation and Conciliation Centre on the HC campus.However, the mediation talks failed, and the special counsellor's confidential report submitted to the court recorded that the child may require specialised counselling from a psychiatrist.When the judges interacted with the girl, she said she wanted to live with her mother in the Andamans. ""However, from the confidential report, we are of the view that there would not be a conducive atmosphere for the minor girl to safely reside in the Andamans. Since the girl said that she does not want to live with her father, the only alternative left to us is to direct her to be put in a safety home,"" the court said.The court then directed police to ensure that the girl is safely admitted to Govt Children's Home for Girls, Kellys, Chennai, by Aug 12. ""During her stay there, the petitioner shall accompany his minor daughter and produce her before Dr Venkat, psychiatrist attached to the Institute of Mental Health, Ayanavaram Road, Kilpauk, by Aug 13 and on any other subsequent dates, as specified by the specialist,"" the bench said.""We request Dr Venkat, psychiatrist, to submit an interim report on his evaluation in a sealed cover. The psychiatrist is also at liberty to counsel the father, who has not been living with his daughter for a very long time.It is made clear that the cost of medical fees and other expenses of the minor girl and the petitioner shall be borne by the petitioner.During the stay of the girl at the govt home, her mother/grandmother are at liberty to visit her during the permissible hours,"" the court added and adjourned the hearing to Aug 26.","14-year-old girl tried to escape from police by jumping from the court's first floor on Tuesday.

'Heroes out of traitors'



Malviya shares Indira Gandhi's 'message' on Savarkar's death



What was oil ministry's post



A social media post by the oil ministry marking Independence Day triggered strong reactions from the opposition, with Congress party accusing the PM Modi government of ""distorting history"" and glorifying “traitors” by placing VD Savarkar above Mahatma Gandhi Taking potshots at the petroleum ministry, Pawan Khera suggested them to serve ""cheap oil instead of cheap comedy"".Bharatiya Janata Party leader Amit Malviya slammed the grand old party for their criticism of Savarkar as he recalled former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s message on the death of the freedom fighter, highlighting her words of praise for him.Party general secretary K C Venugopal posted on X, “Every Independence Day, the Modi-led BJP makes it a point to distort history and make heroes out of traitors.”“This Orwellian image, elevating a British mercy petitioner like Savarkar over Gandhi ji - the undisputed Mahatma who got us freedom, and completely eliminating Pandit Nehru and Sardar Patel ji, shows their contempt for our freedom fighters.”“What else can one except from those whose forefathers collaborated with the British to sow the seeds of division and hatred that haunts us to this very day?” the Congress leader further added.Congress media and publicity department head Pawan Khera also took aim at the government, posting in Hindi, “While mixing ethanol in petrol, now you've started mixing impurities even in freedom fighters. Those who couldn't become great in history, you're making them big on posters.”“The country is asking you for cheaper oil, not cheap comedy,” he further mocked the organisation.BJP general secretary (organisation) B L Santhosh hit back replying to Khera’s post, “Sick brigade to the core... Veer Savarkar lived and died for the country.”Congress whip in the Lok Sabha Manickam Tagore wrote on X, “No matter how hard you try, Mr Modi, you can’t push Mahatma, Netaji & Bhagat Singh below Mafiveer. Don't disgrace the martyrs who fought and died for freedom by glorifying those who begged the British with apology letters.”CPI(M) MP John Brittas also criticised the ministry’s post, saying, “The deliberate elevation of VD Savarkar over Mahatma Gandhi is not a coincidence but a calculated act. The government’s actions undermine the nation's commitment to its secular Constitution. It is pertinent to note that Savarkar was an accused in Gandhi’s assassination, though acquitted due to insufficient evidence.“However, the Kapur Commission highlighted circumstantial evidence implicating Savarkar. Those who uphold the Constitution should unequivocally condemn this mockery of justice and secular values,” he further added.Tushar Gandhi, great grandson of Mahatma Gandhi, joined the criticism row, writing on X, “Shame on the Patroleum And Natural Gas Ministry for placing the traitor and murderer Savarkar above true patriots and martyrs. That to with money of the exchequer.”Amid the opposition’s criticism, BJP leader Amit Malviya recalled former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s message on the death of Veer Savarkar, highlighting her words of praise for him.She said as per the letter shared by Malviya, “Veer Savarkar’s name has been a byword for daring and patriotism. He was cast in the mould of a classical revolutionary, and countless people drew inspiration from him. Death removes from our midst a great figure of contemporary India.”""Malviya remarked that in their opposition to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Congress has now disowned both Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi,"" he further added.The TOI couldn't independently verify the authenticity of the letter.The ministry of petroleum and natural gas shared a picture on X featuring Savarkar alongside Gandhi, Subhas Chandra Bose and Bhagat Singh, with the caption, “Freedom was their gift, shaping the future is our mission”.The ministry’s message read “As we celebrate our nation’s independence, let’s remember — liberty thrives when we nurture it every day, through unity, empathy, and action. Happy Independence Day.”","The oil ministry posted a picture of Veer Savarkar alongside the caption, “Freedom was their gift, shaping the future is our mission’” Congress party accused the PM Modi government of ""distorting history"" and glorifying “traitors” by placing VD Savarksar above Mahatma Gandhi.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123324235,imgsize-763719,width-400,resizemode-4/123324235.jpg"

‘Non-application of mind’: What Supreme Court observed while cancelling Kannada actor Darshan’s bail; pulls up Karnataka HC for giving ‘acquittal order to accused’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/non-application-of-mind-what-supreme-court-observed-while-cancelling-kannada-actor-darshans-bail-pulls-up-karnataka-hc-for-giving-acquittal-order-to-accused/articleshow/123315703.cms,"Misconduct & influence

BENGALURU: Cancelling the bail granted to Kannada actor Darshan and his six aides in the Renukaswamy murder case, the Supreme Court Thursday observed that the order of the Karnataka high court depicted ""non-application of the mind"".The apex court noted that courts are not expected to render findings on the merits of the case at the bail stage. On Dec 13, 2024, the high court single bench judge Justice S Vishwajith Shetty granted regular bail to Darshan (accused number 2), Pavithra Gowda (accused no 1) along with other accused - R Nagaraju, Anu Kumar alias Anu, Lakshman M, Jagadeesh alias Jagga and Pradoosh S Rao - on grounds of non-furnishing of a memo for reasons of arrest as per the mandate of CrPC, several inconsistencies in statements of witnesses, etc.The state govt challenged the verdict. Now, after 244 days, the Supreme Court reversed the order.During the course of hearing the appeals, the SC bench of Justices JB Paridiwala and R Mahadevan even remarked that the high court had handed out ""an acquittal order to the accused"".The bench, in the 66-page order, stated: ""In the present case, the high court failed to properly evaluate the nature of allegations, involving premeditated murder and conspiracy, attracting Section 302 of IPC read with Section 120B IPC; the chain of circumstantial evidence, including CCTV footage, call records and forensic report showing a deliberate attempt to destroy evidence (e.g.,disposal of blood-stained clothes and vehicle cleaning); and the incriminating role of A2 (Darshan), who was in constant touch with A1 (Pavithra Gowda) and other co-accused before and after the incident, and who facilitated the conspiracy and cover-up. On the other hand, it simply recorded that A2 (Darshan) had 'no direct role' and there was 'no prima facie case', without discussing or analysing the incriminating material on record. This amounts to non-application of mind and renders the order unsustainable in law.""By treating Darshan's stature as a mitigating factor, the high court committed a ""manifest perversity"" in the exercise of its discretion, thereby warranting cancellation of bail.""A2 is not a common undertrial. He enjoys celebrity status, mass following, political clout and financial muscle. His conduct inside jail - including recorded instances of VIP treatment, violations of jail rules and registered FIRs for misuse of facilities - reflects his capacity to defy the system even while in custody. If a person can subvert the prison system, the risk of interference with evidence, threatening or influencing witnesses and tampering with the course of justice is both real and imminent,"" the top court observed.Moreover, Darshan's immediate return to social events sharing the stage with prosecution witnesses, and continued influence over police witnesses, despite being on bail, establish that his liberty is a threat to the integrity of the proceedings, the court noted.""Granting leniency to such persons despite grave charges of conspiracy and murder sends the wrong message to society and undermines public confidence in the justice system. Accordingly, the accused's antecedents, influence, jail misconduct, and the seriousness of the charges against him make him unfit for bail,"" the SC stated.The apex court noted that on a cumulative analysis, it is evident that the high court suffers from serious legal infirmities. The order fails to record any special or cogent reasons for granting bail in a case involving charges under Sections 302, 120B and 34 of IPC. Instead, it reflects a mechanical exercise of discretion, marked by significant omissions of legally relevant facts.Moreover, the high court undertook an extensive examination of witness statements at the pre-trial stage, highlighting alleged contradictions and delays - issues that are inherently matters for the trial court to assess through cross-examination. The trial court alone is the appropriate forum to evaluate the credibility and reliability of witnesses, the SC observed.","Kannada actor Darshan and his six aides were granted bail in the Renukaswamy murder case.
