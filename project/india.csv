HYDERABAD: On the day Telangana chief minister A Revanth Reddy hailed fine rice distribution as a historic welfare scheme, Union minister and Karimnagar MP, Bandi Sanjay, on Sunday asked him to display PM Narendra Modi's photo at ration shops, citing the Centre's Rs 40 per kg contribution compared to the state's Rs 10 per kg.""We decided to supply fine rice so that every day feels like a festival for the poor. Earlier, some rice millers and middlemen bought PDS coarse rice at Rs 10 per kg and sold it back to the govt at Rs 30 per kg, causing a Rs 10,000 crore annual loss. Congress govt has put an end to this mafia,"" Reddy told a public meeting in the Huzurnagar assembly seat.The CM said six kg of fine rice would be provided to 3.1 crore people in the state .Slamming Reddy's claim, Bandi at a press conference said, ""Congress is boasting about the fine rice bonus, but the Centre spends Rs 15,000 crore on rice procurement, while the state spends around Rs 2,000 crore. Whose photo should be displayed? It must be PM Narendra Modi's.""

Action should be taken against the traitor,"" Adhikari said.In a letter to EAM Jaishankar, Adhikari demanded a ban on Mamata's foreign visits, alleging that she had ""deliberately tarnished India’s reputation on foreign soil.""The row stems from Banerjee’s address at Oxford University's Kellogg College, where she appeared to ""downplay"" India's economic growth. When a speaker mentioned that India had surpassed the UK as the world's fifth-largest economy and was projected to become the largest by 2060, Banerjee responded, ""I will differ that.""Adhikari termed her response ""treasonous"" and an ""embarrassment for every Bengali and Indian."" He accused Banerjee of displaying ""admiration for colonial rulers"" and urged the ministry of external affairs to investigate her statements. Citing guidelines that require MEA approval for official foreign visits, he suggested her comments should be grounds for disqualification.Banerjee’s UK visit also saw protests at Kellogg College, where demonstrators questioned her stance on election violence in West Bengal and the RG Kar College case.
