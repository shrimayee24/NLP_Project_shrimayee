MADURAI: A Pocso court in Tirunelveli, Tamil Nadu, on Wednesday convicted and sentenced a man to death for sexually assaulting and impregnating his minor daughter.The 49-year-old labourer, an alcoholic, repeatedly sexually assaulted his 14-year-old daughter since Aug 2024. He also threatened the survivor with dire consequences if she revealed the crime to her mother. When she fell ill, her mother took her to primary health centre where doctors found she was pregnant. Upon discovering that her husband had sexually assaulted their daughter, the woman lodged a complaint with an all-women police station in Feb 2025. Police registered a case for offences under the Pocso Act and arrested the accused.Special court judge K Suresh Kumar observed that the harm caused, deliberate misuse of authority, threats, and long-term impact on the survivor demonstrated the extreme seriousness of the offence. Acts committed by those in positions of trust, especially within families, require a strong response to maintain public confidence and protect other children, the judge said.","A Pocso court in Tirunelveli, Tamil Nadu, on Wednesday convicted and sentenced a man to death for sexually assaulting and impregnating his minor daughter.

NEW DELHI: Delhi lieutenant governor VK Saxena on Tuesday wrote to former chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, holding his government responsible for the capital's deteriorating air quality.In a 15-page letter, LG Saxena said, “11 years of neglect and criminal inaction on you and your Government’s part are responsible for the emergency air situation in the Capital”.However, Delhi is currently governed by BJP chief minister Rekha Gupta.Delhi LG’s letter to the former chief minister comes against the backdrop of the capital’s persistent and severe air pollution crisis.On Delhi LG VK Saxena's letter to Kejriwal, AAP national media incharge Anurag Dhandha said, ""Has the LG, who left Delhi amidst all the pollution to go to Gujarat for his own pleasure, returned? I think the pollution affecting people's lungs in Delhi has affected the LG's brain, and he's lost his memory. He doesn't remember that Arvind Kejriwal isn't the Chief Minister anymore, but Rekha Gupta is. If he wanted to ask something about the pollution, he should have asked her. .. LG sir is also a 'CameraG'. He's very fond of being on camera... But nobody pays him any attention these days... That's why he's roaming around in a frenzy...""During his tenure, AAP supremo Kejriwal grappled with similar hazardous air-quality levels and, much like the BJP’s poll manifesto, had pledged an aggressive push to curb pollution in the city.In February this year, the Aam Aadmi Party suffered a major setback, losing the elections to the BJP, paving the way for the saffron party to return to power in Delhi after 26 years.AAP is now reduced to governing only Punjab under chief minister Bhagwant Mann after its loss in Delhi.","Delhi lieutenant governor VK Saxena on Tuesday wrote to former chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.
