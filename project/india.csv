Karnataka bans film over communal concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/karnataka-bans-film-over-communal-concerns/articleshow/110808076.cms,"BENGALURU: Karnataka govt has banned the screening of Bollywood film ‘ Hamare Baarah ’ in the state, citing that it may disturb communal harmony. The movie was scheduled for countrywide release on Friday.The order, issued under sections 15 (1) and 15 (5) of Karnataka Cinema (Regulation) Act 1964, banned the broadcast of even the trailer of the movie for two weeks or until further orders. The move came after several Muslim organisations across the state petitioned the govt, alleging the trailer of the film portrayed Islam in a “humiliating manner” and was “provocative”.“If the movie is screened, it will create rifts between religions and castes. Targeting one religion intentionally, harming communal harmony, creating rifts in the nation, and hurting sentiments of Muslims is part of a conspiracy,” said the order, adding: “Films should play an instrumental role in guiding society and not foment hatred between religions.”BJP’s senior functionary R Ashoka condemned the move, calling it “another attempt to suppress freedom of speech and expression in Karnataka”. Questioning the motives behind the ban, he asked who the CM and Karnataka Congress were trying to appease. “There is no threat to law and order in Karnataka because of this movie, which is being screened across the country. Instead of protecting the civil liberties and freedom of expression CM @siddaramaiah has yet again chosen to stand with radical elements.”","Karnataka govt has banned the screening of Bollywood film ‘ Hamare Baarah ’ in the state, citing that it may disturb communal harmony.

RANCHI: In Jharkhand, the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance secured nine out of the 14 seats, with the BJP winning eight and its alliance partner, the Ajsu Party , retaining its single seat. This outcome mirrors the nationwide decline in the appeal of Modi's leadership. On the other hand, the India bloc demonstrated an improved performance, increasing its seat count from two in 2019 to five in the current election.The results in Jharkhand highlight the shifting political landscape, with the BJP's dominance facing challenges from opposition parties. The India bloc's gains suggest a growing support base and a potential shift in voter preferences. As the nation witnesses a change in the political dynamics, it remains to be seen how these developments will shape the future course of governance and policy-making in the state and beyond.The India bloc has secured all the tribal reserved seats in the recent elections. According to analysts, the Enforcement Directorate's actions against Hemant Soren, the working president of the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and former chief minister, were not well-received by the tribal voters.The JMM emerged victorious in Dumka, Singhbhum, and Rajmahal seats, successfully capitalizing on the tribal sentiment. This sentiment was fueled by the BJP-led central government's refusal to include a separate sarna code in the census register, which is a matter of identity for the tribal community.In an attempt to win the Dumka seat, the BJP had nominated Sita Soren, the elder daughter-in-law of Guruji. However, she was defeated by JMM's Nalin Soren, who secured a margin of 22,527 votes.","In Jharkhand, the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance secured nine out of the 14 seats.

MOHALI/BATHINDA: CISF constable Kulwinder Kaur was charged with ""voluntarily causing hurt"" and ""wrongful restraint"" in an FIR registered by Mohali police on Friday for her alleged act of confronting and slapping actor and newly elected BJP MP Kangana Ranaut at Chandigarh airport.Kulwinder, whom CISF suspended after Kangana's complaint, received support from individuals and organisations, some of whom offered her monetary and legal help if she was arrested or dismissed from service.Kulwinder Kaur, the CISF constable who allegedly confronted and slapped actor-MP Kangana Ranaut at Chandigarh airport on Thursday, has been booked under bailable sections 323 and 341 of IPC. Mohali police are scanning footage from CCTV cameras at the terminal to verify Ranaut's allegations. ""Action per the complaint filed by CISF has been taken. Further action is in process,"" Mohali SSP Sandeep Garg said.CISF DIG Vinay Kajla was quoted as saying that Kulwinder was ""apologetic"" about her ""emotional outburst"" - she allegedly confronted Kangana over her remarks about women's participation in the farm agitation - but there was no official word from the force on this.Sources said CISF will take action based on outcome of departmental inquiry against the constable. Kulwinder's husband, too, is a CISF employee attached to the dog squad and is posted at the same location.Among those who came out in support of the suspended constable was 82-year-old farm activist Mohinder Kaur, who had previously filed a defamation suit against Kangana for her remarks on the farm protest. ""Kangana has no sense of how to speak. Since she has been elected as an MP, she should be polite. She tried to brand Punjabis as extremists. She used derogatory words for us,"" the octogenarian said.Kangana, now MP from Mandi in Himachal, had posted on X a picture of Mohinder as ""dadi of Shaheen Bagh of Delhi"" and alleged that ""such women"" would turn up at a protest site for Rs 100.The actor had later deleted the post. Based on Mohinder's defamation suit, a Bathinda court had issued an arrest warrant against Kangana that a bench of Punjab and Haryana HC had stayed.Meanwhile, Punjab BJP president Sunil Jakhar has termed the airport episode ""most unfortunate"". He said any form of violence as a means of expressing dissent was unacceptable and must be condemned.","CISF constable Kulwinder Kaur was charged with ""voluntarily causing hurt"" and ""wrongful restraint"" in an FIR registered by Mohali police on Friday.

In 72 of the 75 constituencies that it contested both times, the number of votes it polled also fell by anything between a few thousand and 2.2 lakh. All told, it polled about 65 lakh fewer votes in UP this time despite the total number of votes polled in the state going up.The list of constituencies in which BJP got fewer votes this time includes Varanasi, where the PM won, Yogi's home turf Gorakhpur, Rajnath Singh's constituency Lucknow and Faizabad, which includes Ayodhya. Not surprisingly, Amethi and Rae Bareli too figure in the list.The only constituencies in which BJP polled more votes than last time in UP were Gautam Buddha Nagar (Noida) in the national capital region, Bareilly and Kaushambi. Even among these, its vote share was lower in 2024 than in 2019 in Bareilly and just slightly higher in the other two seats.BJP had polled just under 4.3 crore votes of the over 8.6 crore votes in UP last time. This time round, while the total votes polled in the state went up a little to just under 8.8 crore, BJP got a little over 3.6 crore votes.Part of this decline was because it did not contest three of the seats it had contested last time - Bijnor, Baghpat and Ghosi - but even if we look only at the 75 seats it contested in both elections, its votes polled dropped from 4.1 crore to 3.6 crore or about 50 lakh. That's an average of nearly 67,000 votes dropped on each seat.Of the 75 seats, BJP's votes declined by over a lakh in 12, including Mathura, Aligarh, Muzaffarnagar and Fatehpur Sekhri in the west and Gorakhpur in the east. In another 36 seats, the drop was between 50,000 and a lakh. These included Amethi, Rae Bareli, Allahabad, Ghaziabad, Mainpuri and Varanasi, where the PM got over 60,000 votes less this time.BSP had won 8 of these 75 seats last time. Of those, SP and Congress won six this time and Chandrashekhar won Nagina. The decline in its own votes meant that BJP could not capitalize on the BSP's decimation and could only wrest Amroha from it.","In 72 of the 75 constituencies that it contested both times, the number of votes it polled also fell by anything between a few thousand and 2.2 lakh.

Everyone was silent when wrestler daughters were dragged at Jantar mantar who were seeking justice against sexual harassment. Former WFI chief and BJP leader had sexually assaulted wrestlers but all were silent. Lakhs of women nationwide took part in the 2020-21 protest which lasted for 13 months but no one dared to speak even a single word in favor of them but Kangana used derogatory words. Now the CISF official’s action is an outcome of anger due to the statements of the actress. Now it’s a clear message for all political leaders that they should not use any unparliamentary language or words for any community or religions else they will face the same fate in future as people have started a revolution in the nation which can’t be stopped now, he added.Sikkim Nain Sheokand, a woman activist, stated that all kept silent over the deaths of 750 farmers.

Critics had almost begun writing his political epitaph in the run-up to the Lok Sabha elections owing to his frequent flip-flops.At one point of time, Nitish was seen holding BJP's party symbol - lotus - during Modi's roadshow in Patna on May 12 amid speculation that he could hand over the reins to his saffron partner.But silencing his critics, Nitish emerged as a ""kingmaker"" with JD(U) becoming the third-largest party in the NDA.

This is a message to those who predicted political disaster for JD(U) in the polls,"" party spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said. ""The fact is that whether you hate him or love him, you cannot ignore Nitish Kumar,"" he added.BJP reacted cautiously to the banner. ""Nitish-ji is very much active in politics.

Nadda, home minister Amit Shah and defence minister Rajnath Singh held parleys with leaders of NDA constituents.Significantly, Modi tried to douse spiralling speculation about allies seeking to extract plum portfolios and more berths and even the constitutional office of Speaker by asserting that he was not known for giving in to pressure. “I have been watching reports for the past two days and most of them are baseless, far from the truth. They have not got an opportunity in the past 10 years and they might be on an overdrive. A few among us might fall in the trap of such people saying that I have good contact and can get the berth for you. We need to beware of such people... those who know Modi will tell you that such efforts are futile,” Modi said while addressing the NDA parliamentary party soon after being elected its leader.This left many wondering whether the comment, though cloaked in concern for newly-elected MPs, especially first-termers and those belonging to partners, was also meant for those who may have concluded that BJP falling short of majority would render him vulnerable to coalition pressures. It, interestingly, might help the leadership of NDA partners in dealing with surging expectations of their flock that their numbers could be leveraged for outsized returns.Reiterating that his govt won’t be driven by headlines, Modi said there might be people claiming to be distributing portfolios and playing a role in govt formation but such attempts were futile. “If you receive any call, verify 10 times, as there are a few habitually doing so. In this high tech age, letters with my forged signatures could also be circulated and our political rivals are experts in this job. I urge all of you not to fall victim to such conspiracies and be careful about rumours. You need to have faith in the team sitting inside this House,” he said.Nadda had led the NDA delegation which included party leaders Rajnath Singh, Amit Shah, Ashwini Vaishnaw and C N Manjunath. The delegation also had leaders of other parties in the NDA, including N Chandrababu Naidu, Nitish Kumar, Eknath Shinde, H D Kumaraswamy, Chirag Paswan, Jitan Ram Manjhi, Pawan Kalyan, Ajit Pawar, Anupriya Patel, Jayant Chaudhary, Joyanta Basumatary, Atul Bora, Indra Hang Subba, Sudesh Mahto, Chandra Prakash Choudhary and Ramdas Athawale.Later, addressing reporters in the forecourt of Rashtrapati Bhavan, Modi said the President had appointed him prime minister-designate. He said he had informed Murmu that the swearing-in could be held Sunday evening.Modi said Rashtrapati Bhavan would work out the details of the oath-taking ceremony on Sunday, when he would hand over the list of the council of ministers to the President. “The NDA govt has been given a chance to serve the country for the third time. I am grateful to my countrymen, and I assure you that India will continue to develop in every sector at an even faster pace than during our previous two terms,” Modi said.",The President handed over the letter of appointment after BJP chief J P Nadda presented letters of support from NDA parties.

"Committed to principle of ‘sarv panth sambhav (all religions equal)’, says Modi",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/committed-to-principle-of-sarv-panth-sambhav-all-religions-equal-says-modi/articleshow/110807006.cms,"NEW DELHI: Narendra Modi on Friday emphasised the role of consensus in governance as he said the next “10 years of NDA” will be dedicated to good governance , committed to the principal of “sarv panth sambhav” (all religions are equal) to fulfil growing regional and national aspirations as he acknowledged that an era of competitive cooperative federalism had begun.Speaking after his election as leader of the NDA parliamentary party, Modi emphasised that while NDA, a pre-poll alliance, had got the majority, a consensual approach was needed to serve the nation. “Sarkar chalane ke liye bahumat chahiye lekin desh chalane ke liye sarvmat bahut zaroori hai,” he said and asserted, “I assure people of the country and you all that no stone will be left unturned to serve the nation with consensus.”Modi also declared his commitment to “sarv panth sambhav” — the unique Indian concept which enjoins upon the state not to differentiate among citizens on the ground of faith but, unlike in the Western concept of secularism, does not seek to evict religion from the public arena. Political circles felt the remarks stood in contrast to Modi's strong attack on “Muslim quota” which the opposition and others had dubbed divisive and polarising. His putting forward the consensual feat was also seen as a switch prompted by BJP's drop in numbers and the corresponding accretion in the opposition's strength.However, the speech was also an exercise in projecting dominance, with Modi making light of Congress's improved strength by pointing out that even after a decade, Congress could not win a three-digit tally. He echoed the sentiment of allies like CMs of Bihar and Maharashtra, Nitish Kumar and Eknath Shinde, who contended that the opposition had managed to sway sections with their “false narratives”, and that the increased strength of Congress was an aberration, rather than the beginning of a pattern. “So far, they were sinking slowly but now they will hurtle down the abyss,” Modi said even as he projected another 10 years of NDA at the Centre.He also mocked celebrations post-verdict in the opposition camp. “For two days after the election results came, some people created such an atmosphere that we had lost. But the country knows that we were not defeated. Our values are such that victory does not create hysteria among us and we do not ridicule the defeated,” he said. He added that even a child would tell that it was the NDA that was in office before the polls and which is in office after the polls. ""Where did we lose? NDA was there yesterday, is there today and will be there tomorrow.”Modi, however, also emphasised that for all the jubilation in the Congress camp, the party 's cumulative score in the last three elections was lower than what BJP achieved in this election.Modi, who mentioned NDA nearly 20 times, said the combine stood for ""New India, Developed India and Aspirational India"" and, unlike the “INDI Alliance”, was not an alliance of convnience. ""It is an organic alliance,"" he said, promising that the allies could always count on him for any help. ""Jahan kaam wahan hum,” he assured.Referring to AAP's pullout of of “INDI bloc”, Modi said his prediction that the opposition alliance would start unravelling after declaration of results had come true. He emphasised that NDA was the longest-surviving alliance and was committed to the policy of “nation first” as he also attacked the INDIA bloc as a contrast which had grouped together for its hunger for office and obsession to defeat just one person. “If you see in the context of alliances and statistics, then this is the strongest alliance govt,"" he said.Modi highlighted the growing footprint of NDA, saying the alliance was in office in 22 states, which reflected the spirit of India in its true essence. “There are 10 tribal-dominated states of which NDA is serving in seven states. We are committed to the Constitution's spirit of ‘ sarv panth sambhav ’, look at Goa and north-eastern states, where Christian community is predominant but we have got the opportunity to serve,” Modi said.","Narendra Modi says next '10 years of NDA' will be dedicated to good governance.

On June 1, Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar had appeared before court in connection with the case and Rahul, through his advocate, had sought time for appearance citing his busy political schedule. Special judge KN Shivakumar had allowed it and directed Gandhi to appear on Friday.

Siddaramaiah, DK Shivakumar and other Congress politicians accompanied Rahul when he walked into court on Friday. Gandhi's counsel applied for bail and ex-Bengaluru Rural MP DK Suresh stood surety. Court granted the bail and adjourned the matter.

Apart from the onion ban issue, the party MLAs pointed at the growing distress among the cotton and soyabean farmers in the state, who were receiving low price for their yield, affecting them financially.""It was decided in the Thursday meeting that after Prime Minister Narendra Modi takes oath for his third term, an NCP delegation led by Ajit Dada would meet him and other Union ministers requesting greater focus on farmers' issues . The focus will be on measures to overcome the problems in Maharashtra,"" Kokate said. According to the NCP MLAs, the Union govt must play a proactive role in reducing the distress among the farmers in Maharashtra ahead of the assembly polls. ""The NCP will put pressure on Centre to roll back the ban on onion exports and solve the other issues plaguing the farmers in Maharashtra,"" Kokate added.","Ajit Pawar had called the meeting of the party MLAs to take stock of his party's poor performance in the recently concluded general election. The NCP managed to win only one of the four seats it contested. Some of the MLAs felt that Centre's failure to lift the ban on onion exports before the election ""sent a wrong message to the onion growers""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110806429,imgsize-1767234,width-400,resizemode-4/110806429.jpg"

Delhi HC nixes Sengar plea to suspend 10-year jail term,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-hc-nixes-sengar-plea-to-suspend-10-year-jail-term/articleshow/110806382.cms,"NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Friday refused to suspend the 10-year jail term awarded to expelled BJP leader Kuldeep Singh Sengar for the custodial death of the Unnao rape victim 's father.

Seeking suspension of his sentence during the pendency of his appeal against conviction, Sengar said that he had already served almost six years, and the prosecution's case against him was solely based on circumstantial evidence.

Justice Swarana Kanta Sharma, however, said once an accused is held guilty, the presumption of innocence gets erased. His application for suspension of sentence has to be considered on the basis of a prima facie view of his role, gravity of offence, etc and the period undergone in jail is only one of these several factors, Justice Sharma said. The court noted that factors such as nature of the crime, criminal antecedents of the convict, impact on public confidence and threat to the victims have to be appreciated while deciding suspension of sentence.

","The decision was made on a case-by-case basis. The decision was taken on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the case at the time. The case was decided by a panel of three judges, including the chief justice of the high court.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110806384,imgsize-1003813,width-400,resizemode-4/110806384.jpg"

The then railway minister also entered into conspiracy with officers of Central Railways and others, collected applications and documents of such candidates through his associates and then sent those to Central Railway to process and provide jobs in Railways,” CBI said.According to CBI, the candidates were engaged in complete violation of guidelines and in lieu of transfer of land by the candidate himself/by family members and/or by submitting fake educational certificates.Candidates who were engaged as substitutes in different railway zones were mainly from districts which fell in the constituencies of then Union railway minister and his family members.This is the first time that Tej Pratap and Hema have been chargesheeted in a corruption case.

"NDA allies call for review of Agnipath, JD(U) distances itself",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nda-allies-call-for-review-of-agnipath-jdu-distances-itself/articleshow/110776483.cms,"Top Picks For You 'A section of voters upset': JD(U) seeks review of Agniveer scheme

NEW DELHI: NDA partners JD(U), led by Nitish Kumar, and Chirag Paswan ’s LJP on Thursday articulated concern over the Agnipath scheme which was used by the opposition to attack govt over inadequate generation of jobs, though the former backpedalled on its comments saying they were twisted out of context.JD(U) general secretary K C Tyagi was the first off the blocks, telling TV news channels that his party, which with 12 MPs may have an outsized role in the BJP-led coalition govt, will insist on a review of the Agnipath scheme under which 75% of recruits, the Agniveers, will be let go of after four years while the rest get to serve for another 15 years.LJP (Ram Vilas) chief Chirag Paswan, in response to a question, told NDTV that govt must revisit the Agnipath scheme to ascertain whether it had delivered the desired results. “If somebody has raised it, the NDA gives us that platform to sit and discuss. Yesterday (Wednesday), in the (NDA) meeting, my PM said on record that he is open to discussion. This platform is open and he is easily available for discussion of concerns and suggestions. If somebody feels or any party feels, I definitely believe that we must revisit that (Agnipath),” he said.Paswan said the govt must carry out an assessment of how much could be delivered through this scheme as it directly concerned youngsters. “If it is beneficial and working for them as per the intention of the scheme and it is getting penetrated well, then we must continue. If not, then we should come up with suggestions of what can be done. But these things can be kept on hold for a while or till govt formation. So, immediately after that, we can sit and discuss all these things,” he said.The comments were interpreted as muscle-flexing by allies whose strength has acquired disproportionate dimension because of BJP lacking its own majority, before Tyagi dialled back by saying that his comments to TV channels were edited out of context.“What is said was in exact sync with the line articulated on several occasions by Rajnath Singh that the scheme is going to be reviewed periodically to look for shortcomings and their removal,” Tyagi said, adding that there were reports of unhappiness among a section of voters in western UP and Rajasthan. “My assertion that JD(U) is part of NDA and has extended unconditional support to the Modi govt was also left out,” he further said.On JD(U)’s support to a Modi-led govt, Tyagi said, “There is no pre-condition, there is unconditional support. But it is in our mind and heart that Bihar should be given special status. After bifurcation, the situation Bihar has faced, it cannot be corrected without granting special status.”On caste census, which was carried out by the Nitish Kumar govt in Bihar with the support of BJP, RJD and all other political parties, Tyagi said, “No party in the country has opposed caste census. Bihar has shown the way, the prime minister also did not oppose... It is the demand of the time, and we will pursue it.”Paswan also backed a caste-wise headcount. “Me and my party do support caste census. There’s a reason behind this because even after seven decades of Independence, there are still schemes and policies which are drafted for the upliftment of a particular caste or section of society. Many times, courts have also asked for the population count of a particular caste. So, I do believe that govt should have these details with it, what is the figure of a particular caste. I’m not in favour of making it public, because that increases the divide,” he said.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had made caste census one of his main campaign themes.Tyagi said JD(U) was not opposed to Uniform Civil Code but all stakeholders should be consulted. “On UCC, the chief minister (Nitish Kumar) had written to the Law Commission. We are not against UCC. But there should be consultation with all stakeholders, chief ministers, political parties and different sects, and a resolution should be found,” he said.","JD(U) general secretary K C Tyagi was the first off the blocks, telling TV news channels that his party will insist on a review of the Agnipath scheme. Tyagi said there were reports of unhappiness among a section of voters in western UP and Rajasthan.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to take oath his third successive term on June 8.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) secured victory in the recent Lok Sabha elections, clinching 240 seats. However, this figure falls significantly short of the impressive 303 seats the party had won in the 2019 elections, meaning it has been unable to convert its vote share into seats this time.Several factors contributed to the loss of over 60 seats. The Samajwadi Party, led by Akhilesh Yadav, made substantial gains in Uttar Pradesh, a crucial state that had played a pivotal role in the Prime Minister's two previous victories. The Samajwadi Party emerged as the star performer of the Congress-led alliance, delivering its best-ever Lok Sabha performance. The BJP's seat count in the state fell from 64 in 2019 to 33, while the NDA's tally dropped to 34.In Maharashtra, the effective collaboration among Congress, Uddhav Thackeray, and Sharad Pawar resulted in a setback for the ruling party's performance. In West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee successfully defended her stronghold.The following is a state-wise breakdown of the election results:","Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to take oath on June 8.

VISAKHAPATNAM/VIJAYAWADA: The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) emerged victorious in the Lok Sabha election in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, securing 31 out of the 42 seats, a significant improvement from their tally of just four seats in the 2019 polls. This success helped the BJP compensate for some of its losses in other parts of the country. N Chandrababu Naidu , the former chief minister of the erstwhile undivided state of Andhra Pradesh, spearheaded the NDA's impressive performance. His party, the Telugu Desam Party ( TDP ), won a remarkable 16 out of the 25 seats in Andhra Pradesh. The BJP, which contested six seats in the state, managed to secure three seats, while actor-politician Pawan Kalyan's Janasena Party won two seats.The ruling YSRCP faced a setback, managing to win only four seats in the state.The Congress-led INDIA alliance suffered a complete defeat, failing to secure a single seat in Andhra Pradesh, mirroring their performance in the 2019 polls.In the state of Andhra Pradesh, Daggubati Purandheshwari , the BJP state party president, emerged victorious in Rajahmundry, despite facing accusations of being an ""outsider"" from her political opponents. Meanwhile, in Nellore, Vemireddy Prabhakar Reddy , the TDP candidate, secured a win against V Vijaysai Reddy of the ruling YSRCP. Vemireddy had recently switched allegiance from the YSRCP to the TDP, citing chief ministerYS Jagan Mohan Reddy 's alleged disregard for his self-respect as the reason for his defection.The Kadapa Lok Sabha constituency, known as a bastion of the ruling family, saw an intense rivalry between siblings during the elections. YS Sharmila, the sister of chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, contested from the region on a Congress ticket, going up against her cousin and YSRCP candidate, YS Avinash Reddy. Sharmila was unsuccessful in her bid, with Avinash Reddy securing the seat for the YSRCP.In 1996, after the BJP was invited to form the government, Chandrababu Naidu became the convenor of the United Front, which governed the Centre from 1996-98 with the outside support of the Congress, following Vajpayee's resignation after a 13-day stint. In mid-April 1997, when the Congress withdrew its support from the UF government led by then Prime Minister H D Deve Gowda, Naidu played a crucial role in the selection of the next Prime Minister.Now, 27 years later, as the election results poured in on Tuesday, it became evident that Naidu, at the age of 74, has returned to his role as a kingmaker. The TDP has emerged as the second-largest party in the NDA, securing 16 Lok Sabha seats in Andhra Pradesh. This outcome means that while the BJP requires Naidu's support at the Centre, he does not need them in the state, solidifying his position as a kingmaker.In the lead-up to the assembly elections, Naidu had a clear understanding of his political vote bank. The TDP was aware of the popularity of the freebies offered by former chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy, particularly among women voters. Consequently, the party made a concerted effort to win over this constituency. Naidu's son, Nara Lokesh, specifically reached out to women voters during his Yuva Gallam Yatra. The TDP enjoys the support of the politically influential Kamma community, but to secure victory, Naidu needed to win over the Kaapu community, which also supports Jagan Reddy. By forming an alliance with Pawan Kalyan's Jana Sena Party, Naidu gained the crucial support of the Kaapus, and this arithmetic worked in his favor in both the parliamentary and assembly elections.","The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) secured 31 out of the 42 seats.
