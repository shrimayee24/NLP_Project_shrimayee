NEW DELHI: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday said she ""loves Bangladesh as a country, because their language is same,"" before training guns at the BJP-led central government and the Election Commission over the ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of the electoral roll, warning that the exercise must not be rushed ahead of the 2026 Assembly polls.Addressing an anti-SIR rally in Bongaon, the chief minister told the crowd, ""If your name gets deleted, the central government should also be deleted.""Referring to claims that the aim of the SIR is to remove Bangladeshi nationals from the voter list, she asked why the exercise was being conducted in several BJP-ruled states as well and questioned the purpose behind the revision.""I love Bangladesh as a country, because our language is the same. I am from Birbhum, but one day they will call me Bangladeshi. PM Modi got votes in 2024 as per the same list. If your name gets deleted, the central government should also be deleted. Why conducting SIR in such a hurry?"" she said.""Till I am here, I will not allow them to throw you out. Nobody can throw you out. If Bangladeshi is a problem, then why are you conducting SIR in Madhya Pradesh and UP?"" she asked.She asserted that she has no fear of the ruling party, declaring, "" BJP cannot fight and defeat me politically,"" and accused the Centre of using the SIR exercise to target voters.Further indicating conditional support for the revision, Banerjee said, ""If SIR is conducted over two-three years, we will support the exercise with every possible resource.""The chief minister accused the Election Commission of losing its neutrality, stating that the ""EC is no longer an impartial body, it has turned into a ‘BJP Commission’.""She claimed that people would realise the ""disaster"" caused by the EC and BJP once the draft voter list is published after the SIR. ""Does conducting SIR in BJP-ruled states imply the Centre accepts ‘ghuspaithiyas’ exist there?"" she asked.These remarks come as the Election Commission has begun the second phase of the Special Intensive Revision across 12 states and Union Territories.The final electoral roll is scheduled to be published on February 7, 2026. The first phase was carried out in Bihar before its Assembly elections.The current phase covers Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Kerala, Lakshadweep, Madhya Pradesh, Puducherry, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal.","Mamata Banerjee says she has no fear of the ruling party, declaring, "" BJP cannot fight and defeat me politically"" She accuses the Centre of using the SIR exercise to target voters.

Kerala government has no locus standi to seek SIR deferment: EC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kerala-government-has-no-locus-standi-to-seek-sir-deferment-ec/articleshow/125574201.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a late evening filing Tuesday, Election Commission told Supreme Court the Kerala govt has no locus standi to seek postponement of the special intensive revision (SIR) of the state's electoral rolls on the ground of a parallel process being underway for local body elections.EC said it has issued categorical instructions to ensure that SIR activities are conducted in a manner that does not overlap with or interfere in any way with local body poll work.It said, ""Kerala lacks the requisite locus standi to seek deferment of SIR on the ground of its simultaneous conduct with the local self-govt institution elections, as the authority to determine the schedule and conduct of such local elections exclusively vests with the Kerala State Election Commission (KSEC).""Fixing poll schedules from the grassroots level democratic bodies to that of Parliament is the sole prerogative of SEC and if any was to be aggrieved by simultaneous conduct of SIR and local body elections, it should have been KSEC and not the state govt, EC said.""Kerala SEC and the Kerala chief electoral officer (CEO) are functioning in close coordination to ensure smooth and efficient conduct of both local body elections and SIR without any disruption to either process,"" EC said, adding district collectors, who are also the district election officers for both local body polls and SIR, have assured adequate administrative arrangements are in place to facilitate efficient implementation of both activities.It said, ""District collectors are authorised to engage only those personnel who are not assigned local body poll duties for SIR-related work.

Omar Abdullah slams BJP in Muslims’ admission row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/omar-abdullah-slams-bjp-in-muslims-admission-row/articleshow/125571221.cms,"Omar Abdullah (File photo)

SRINAGAR: J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah slammed Tuesday BJP’s objections to admission of Muslims in Katra’s Vaishno Devi Medical College, saying the party should then have it declared as a minority institution.Deputy CM Surinder Choudhary joined Omar in denouncing BJP’s stance, with the two heavyweights of the governing National Conference (NC) framing its objections as a direct challenge to India’s secular principles and constitutional values.“If you don’t want Muslim students to study in the medical college, then declare it a minority institution. There is one Sikh candidate and several Muslim candidates, let them know it so they can withdraw and seek admission elsewhere. If this continues, our children will go elsewhere. They will go to Bangladesh or Turkey to study,” Omar said.The row erupted after the new college filled seats strictly on NEET’s merit list and reserved 85% of its seats for J&K domiciles, with only eight Hindu students from Jammu making it to the first MBBS batch of 50.After the admissions were completed, VHP and Bajrang Dal were the first to protest, arguing that an institution funded by Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board should give preference to Hindus only.BJP joined them later. On Saturday, BJP’s leader of opposition Sunil Sharma formally lodged a protest with J&K lieutenant-governor (LG) Manoj Sinha, who is ex-officio chairman of the shrine board, submitting a memorandum seeking a review of admission norms.On Tuesday, J&K BJP president and Rajya Sabha member Sat Sharma reiterated the position, saying only those who have faith in Shri Mata Vaishno Devi should get admission in the medical college, which comes under Mata Vaishno Devi University.Omar questioned the stance. “When the J&K assembly passed the bill (for the university)...it was clearly stated that admissions will be based on merit. If you want admissions without merit, then seek permission from Supreme Court. As far as I know, our Constitution does not allow religion-based admissions,” the CM said.Omar urged BJP to read the bill under which Mata Vaishno Devi University was established, insisting nowhere does it mention “religion-based admissions”.The CM drew a parallel with Vaishno Devi Hospital, which has been functioning in Katra for several years. “If that logic is applied, then Muslims or non-Hindus should be denied treatment at the hospital? Where will it end? Should we ask people their faith before giving them ration? Should the police decide their duty based on religion?” Omar said.The word “secularism” is still in the Constitution, Omar pointed out. “If you don’t want secularism in this country, remove it from the Constitution. Then you can do what you want, and we will do what we must.”Deputy CM Choudhary asserted that admissions cannot be tied to faith. “These (medical college) students have qualified NEET. We must maintain brotherhood and it shouldn’t be made an issue,” Choudhary said.","J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah slams BJP's objections to admission of Muslims in Katra's Vaishno Devi Medical College.
