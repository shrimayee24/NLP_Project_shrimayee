Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah booked in MUDA-linked money laundering case by ED,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/karnataka-cm-siddaramaiah-booked-in-muda-linked-money-laundering-case-by-ed/articleshow/113820145.cms,"Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah

NEW DELHI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Monday filed a money-laundering case against Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah , linked to the Mysuru Urban Development Authority (MUDA). The ED’s action comes in response to a state Lokayukta FIR , registered last week, that accuses the CM and others of irregularities in the allotment of land by the authority.Siddaramaiah’s wife BM Parvathi, his brother-in-law Mallikarjuna Swamy, and Devaraju, the individual from whom Swamy purchased land before gifting it to Parvathi, are also named in the FIR.The case, filed by the Lokayukta police on September 27, was ordered by a Bengaluru special court. The court’s decision came a day after the Karnataka High Court upheld Governor Thaawarchand Gehlot’s sanction to investigate Siddaramaiah over the allegations.The ED has registered an Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR), similar to a police FIR, under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). This allows the agency to summon the accused for questioning and potentially seize their assets during the investigation.Siddaramaiah, 76, has denied any wrongdoing. Last week, he said the case was politically motivated , alleging that the opposition was ""scared"" of him. He emphasized, “This is the first such political case against me,” adding that he has no intention of resigning and plans to fight the case legally.The controversy revolves around accusations that compensatory plots were allocated to Siddaramaiah’s wife in an upscale Mysuru area. The property is allegedly more valuable than the land MUDA originally acquired from her.The Lokayukta FIR has been registered under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) like 120B (criminal conspiracy), 166 (public servant disobeying law, with intent to cause injury to any person), 403 (dishonest misappropriation of property), 406 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 426 (mischief), 465 (forgery), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 340 (wrongful confinement) and 351 (assault).","The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Monday filed a money-laundering case against Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah.

anti-incumbency

fears made BJP re-strategise

GURGAON: This assembly election in Haryana, BJP's posters speak louder than any campaign speech.After 10 years in office in the state, the party does not have Manohar Lal Khattar , who served as CM for almost the entire period before BJP replaced him with Nayab Singh Saini this March and moved him to the Centre as Union minister for housing and urban affairs, on its posters.It has gone with Saini's face alongside a slightly larger one of Modi, but both are mugshots that sit in a corner of the posters, a conspicuous departure from BJP campaigns in the state and nationally since 2014 in which Modi's face would be the centrepiece. This time the face of the aam aadmi dominates posters.On BJP posters both on billboards and online, instead, are faces of common woman and man. Students, young entrepreneurs, women and even farmers, all promoting govt initiatives, its highway projects, startup policies, etc.One poster, featuring a farmer, says, “Yeh hai highway se dooriyan kam karne wali sarkar (This is a govt that bought the highways closer to us)”. Another, with a woman’s face on it, says, “Yeh hai startup ko support karne wali sarkar (This is a govt that supports startups)”It’s evident that the party — seen to be facing anti-incumbency headwinds and dropping from all 10 LS seats to 5 in the April-May general elections — sees strength in govt schemes. Since Lok Sabha polls, in which BJP fell short of the majority and formed a coalition govt, Haryana and J&K are the first major elections. While state BJP chief Mohan Lal Badoli could not be reached, party insiders said it was compelled to re-strategise to reduce the impact of anti-incumbency in the elections.In March, BJP effected a change of guard just before Lok Sabha polls by bringing in Kurukshetra MP and state unit chief Saini. The Saini govt has since gone on a welfarist push. One of the first things it did was to launch ‘Happy (Haryana Antyodaya Parivar Parivahan Yojana) card’, offering free bus rides up to 1,000km a year to members of families with an annual income up to Rs 1 lakh. “Yeh hai humein muft bus yatra karane wali sarkar (This is a govt that has given us free bus rides),” proclaims a poster advertising the scheme, the biggest faces on it is that of a family.“We understand that after being in office for 10 years, some amount of anti-incumbency has set in, and thus, there was a need to replace the CM face and change our strategy. Our ground reports backed up this assessment,” said a senior BJP functionary, when asked about its thought behind the posters. New schemes BJP has proposed have also found prominence in the campaign, like Lado Lakshmi (Rs 2,100 for women in BPL families) and an Olympic Games nursery in every district.Rao Narbir Singh, who was a minister in the first Khattar govt and is contesting from Gurgaon’s Badshapur this time to try and win back the seat he lost in 2019, has been praising Saini in his speeches but makes no mention of his former boss Khattar. Asked about the posters, he was candid. “Whatever development work was done, at least in Gurgaon, it happened from 2014-2019. After this, not even a foundation stone for a community centre was laid. This is probably why the faces on the poster are of the common man,” he said.","After 10 years in office in the state, the party does not have Manohar Lal Khattar on its posters.

Party general secretary Jairam Ramesh said, “It is no secret that ED has become an instrument of harassment, vendetta, revenge and vengeance on his political opponents by the PM.

In a bitter display of spite, he unnecessarily dragged PM Modi into his personal health matters by saying he would die only after removing PM Modi from power,"" Shah said.Defence minister Rajnath Singh jibed at Kharge by saying the Congress president could look forward to a long life as Modi would remain PM for several years to come. ""I pray to God that you live till 125 years and till then Modi ji will remain Prime Minister,"" Singh said, while his colleague Nirmala Sitharaman said Kharge's statement showed the hate and fear Congress people had for the PM.Kharge responded to Shah by saying the home minister should ""focus on serious issues like Manipur, census and caste census"".Writing a day after Kharge became ill and Modi called him to ask about his health, Shah wrote on X, ""As for the health of Kharge ji, Modi ji prays, I pray and we all pray that he lives a long, healthy life. May he continue to live for many years and may he live to see the creation of a Viksit Bharat by 2047.""""Aptly said, home minister Amit Shah ji,"" Sitharaman wrote on X.Reacting to Shah's statement, Kharge's communications in-charge and AICC secretary Pranav Jha said, ""What is Amit Shah objecting to? He is objecting that the Congress chief spoke about removing BJP from power, about defeating them... It is the people of the country, people of the state who defeat someone. The HM just wanted to prove his loyalty to the PM. There was nothing objectionable as such.""",Mallikarjun Kharge had said he would not die until PM Narendra Modi was removed from office.
