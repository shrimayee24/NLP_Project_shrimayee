TMC first came up with idea of no-trust motion against VP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tmc-first-came-up-with-idea-of-no-trust-motion-against-vp/articleshow/116190153.cms,"Jagdeep Dhankhar

To bring a motion to remove the VP, a 14-day notice has to be given and it should be approved by the deputy chairman before it is taken up. With the winter session ending on Dec 20, the notice submitted on Tuesday may not cover the required number of days. Opposition sources said they plan to submit a fresh notice in the next session.It is learnt that 10 days ago, TMC first came up with the suggestion of a no-confidence move against the VP. ""However, with Congress caught up with the Adani issue, it was conveyed to Sonia Gandhi , who spoke to Congress president and leader of opposition in RS Mallikarjun Kharge, encouraging him to join the move,"" a source told TOI. It was decided that Kharge, Sonia and floor leaders of opposition parties would not be among the signatories to the notice, sources said.Since their first step during the monsoon session, opposition parties had gathered what they called ""evidence"" by compiling videos, articles and other documents, to prove their accusation of bias against the VP.In fact, a video clip also showed Dhankhar picking on BJP's Piyush Goyal.The opposition has been upset with Dhankhar over multiple issues, the latest trigger being him allowing BJP members to raise allegations of links between Congress representatives and controversial billionaire George Soro, who, the saffron party claims, are involved in ""anti-India activities"".The opposition said his conduct in the House on Dec 9, 2024, was ""particularly one-sided and totally unfair"", and that he was ""encouraging and provoking"" the treasury benches to make outrageous remarks. The motion submitted by the opposition MPs said it was ""unbecoming of high-level constitutional authorities that are expected to act in accordance with and in furtherance of the principles enshrined in the Constitution of India"".The motion said Dhankhar's term as RS chairman was ""rife with instances"" where he has ""acted in a manner that is explicitly partisan and unfair towards members belonging to the opposition"".They accused him of repeatedly making disparaging comments about opposition members, criticising actions where their MPs have expressed their views on issues concerning functioning of govt.They mentioned an instance from July where Dhankhar, while presiding over the House, labelled himself as the ""Eklavya of RSS"".It said Dhankhar has repeatedly denied ""legitimate requests"" of the leader of opposition in RS to intervene and rebut the PM and the leader of the House. They also alleged he was being an ""impassioned spokesperson of govt's policies in public forums across the country"".","A 14-day notice has to be given and it should be approved by the deputy chairman before it is taken up.

NEW DELHI: The Congress, weakened by its electoral losses in Haryana and Maharashtra, now faces a strong challenge to its leadership of the INDIA(Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance) bloc. Days after the Congress dismissed Mamata Banerjee 's pitch to lead the opposition coalition as a "" good joke"", some of its allies have openly backed the Trinamool chief's claim while others said they are open to the idea of leadership change.Mamata Banerjee had last week expressed dissatisfaction with the functioning of the INDIA bloc and signalled her intent to take charge of the alliance if given the opportunity. ""What can I do if they cannot run the show? I do not lead the front. Those who are in leadership positions there should think about it. But still, I am maintaining my connections with the regional and national parties,"" Mamata had said. ""There are some who cannot tolerate me. If given the responsibility, though I do not want that, I can run it (INDIA bloc) from West Bengal. But I do not want to stay away from Bengal. I was born here and will die here,"" the West Bengal chief minister had added.While Mamata's target would be the Gandhis, especially Rahul, the fact remains that the INDIA bloc is being led by Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge at present.On Tuesday, RJD chief Lalu Prasad not just endorsed Mamata's claim but also dismissed any possible objections by the Congress. ""Mamta Banerjee should be allowed to head the INDIA bloc. The Congress's opposition will not make any difference,"" Lalu said when asked about change in leadership of the opposition coalition.Lalu is the second senior leader of the opposition coalition to endorse Mamata's leadership claim. Last week, NCP-SP chief Sharad Pawar had said the Trinamool Congress chief is a capable leader and has the right to show her intent to head the opposition alliance. ""She is a capable leader in the country and has the right to say it. The MPs she has sent to the Parliament are hardworking and aware,"" Pawar had said when asked about Mamata's claim.The Shiv Sena(UBT) of Uddhav Thackeray has also backed the idea of discussions on leadership change and wants the Congress to convene a meeting of the INDIA bloc to discuss the issue.""If some of our allies, be it TMC, Lalu ji, or Akhilesh ji, have a different opinion about the INDIA alliance, we all have formed the INDIA alliance together. If someone wants to say something new and wants to strengthen the INDIA bloc, then it should be considered,"" Shiv Sena (UBT) Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Raut said. ""Congress should join the discussion and put forward its point,"" he added.Samajwadi Party, another key party of the opposition alliance, feels Mamata's leadership claim is triggered by string of poor electoral performances by the Congress.""In Himachal Pradesh, where the Congress is in power, they lost all four seats. Similarly, in Karnataka and Telangana, both Congress-ruled states, they lost half of their Lok Sabha seats. Furthermore, Congress failed to win even a single seat in Madhya Pradesh. It suffered major losses in Chhattisgarh. Had Congress performed better in the Lok Sabha elections, Narendra Modi would not have become the Prime Minister today,"" Samajwadi Party leader Ram Gopal Yadav had said reacting to calls for change in INDIA bloc leadership.Mamata's party Trinamool Congress, however, directly targeted the Congress and urged the grand old party to get rid of its ego.""We had said earlier only that Congress should understand that INDIA bloc has failed under its leadership. It will be good if Mamata Didi is brought for leadership (of INDIA bloc). Out of all the leaders, Mamata Didi's name is on top when it comes to fighting politically,"" TMC MP Kalyan Banerjee said. ""Congress should get rid of its ego. She knows how to raise the issues related to the people,"" he added.This is not the first time Mamata Banerjee has taken up cudgels against the Congress. Ahead of the 2019 elections, Mamata alongwith TRS chief K Chandrashekhar Rao had made a strong pitch for a non-Congress, non-BJP federal front. However, their efforts for a third front did not fructify.The INDIA bloc's first meeting in Patna was hosted by Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, who had worked actively to bring together regional parties against the BJP. More than 32 leaders of around 17 political parties had attended the Patna meeting. However, from there on the Congress took over the leadership of the coalition and Nitish, who wanted to be the leader/convener of the alliance, eventually walked out of the INDIA bloc and joined hands with the BJP.While Congress has struggled to defeat the BJP in elections after elections, Mamata Banerjee has emerged as a strong anti-BJP pillar in West Bengal defeating the saffron party again and again in her state. However, the Congress has been quick to question Mamata's electoral performance outside West Bengal.With 99 MPs in Lok Sabha and the only party to have pan-India presence, the Congress is unlikely to accept the leadership of any regional leader, more so of Mamata Banerjee with whom they share a blow hot and cold relationship. With its dwindling electoral fortunes, the grand old party faces a real challenge this time around. For now, the Congress seems to be avoiding direct confrontation, with Rahul Gandhi advising party MPs to not react to ongoing leadership debate. The Congress seems to have survived BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's electoral pitch of Congress-mukt Bharat and Congress-mukt India, but if the regional parties continue to flex their muscles, we may see Congress-mukt INDIA - an opposition bloc minus the Congress.(With inputs from agencies)",Mamata Banerjee had last week expressed dissatisfaction with the functioning of the INDIA bloc. RJD chief Lalu Prasad not just endorsed Mamata's claim but also dismissed any possible objections by the Congress. The Shiv Sena of Uddhav Thackeray has also backed the idea of discussions on leadership change.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116177691,imgsize-141274,width-400,resizemode-4/116177691.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The opposition INDIA bloc in Maharashtra will move the Supreme Court over the alleged manipulation of EVMs in the recent assembly elections.The decision to approach the Supreme Court against the Election Commission was announced by Prashant Jagtap, leader of the NCP-Sharad Pawar who lost the assembly elections from the Hadapsar seat in Pune.The decision was announced after a meeting between NCP-SP chief Sharad Pawar, AAP convenor Arvind Kejriwal and noted lawyer and Congress leader Abhishek Singhvi, reported news agency PTI.In the meeting, Kejriwal also flagged concerns related to voter lists in Delhi where assembly elections are due early next year.Earlier in the day, the Election Commission of India (ECI) claimed that, in a mandatory count, there was no mismatch found in the Voter-Verified Paper Audit Trial (VVPAT) slips and the votes polled in the Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) during the recently concluded Maharashtra assembly elections .In the elections held last month, the BJP-led Mahayuti received a paradigm-shattering mandate as the ruling coalition won 235 seats in the 288-member assembly while the opposition was virtually decimated, withMaha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance bagging only 46.The issue of EVMs authenticity had blown up after the Maharsthra polls as over 20 candidates from opposition parties who lost the assembly elections raised serious concerns about the integrity of EVMs.These candidates had alleged significant discrepancies between the votes polled and the results declared, particularly in constituencies where opposition had expected strong performance.Last week, the opposition parties in Maharashtra boycotted the oath-taking ceremony during the first day of the assembly's special session. The boycott was led by the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance, which included prominent opposition parties like Shiv Sena (UBT) and the NCP led by Sharad Pawar.The leaders of these parties, including Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Aaditya Thackeray, voiced their concerns regarding the fairness of the recent elections. Thackeray accused the Election Commission of allowing ""misuse of EVMs"" during the state assembly elections.","The opposition INDIA bloc in Maharashtra will move the Supreme Court over the alleged manipulation of EVMs in the recent assembly elections.

We have shown the first video of it. Look at the bathroom and the gym of that house. There are granites and equipment, look at the sauna and jacuzzi baths, like that of a 7-star resort. This is the reality of the black money hoarded by Arvind Kejriwal who calls himself a common man. He has to answer why he wanted to hide his house and hide the key to the house,"" Sachdeva told news agency ANI.He further added: ""It is not a CM residence, it is a museum of corruption. They should open it for the people. I challenge him to open the doors of this palace and tell the people of Delhi how he has fooled them... This is a government of scams. They have shamed Delhi.""The BJP has alleged that around Rs 45 crore was spent on the ""renovation"" of Kejriwal's official residence - 6, Flagstaff Road - in the Civil Lines area of the city.The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leaders outrightly dismissed allegations made by Sachdeva, terming them ""baseless propaganda"" by the BJP.""The BJP has no achievements to showcase. Instead of answering critical questions about mismanagement of funds for schools, mid-day meals, and hospitals in states like Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, they focus on Kejriwal's former official residence. People ask about education and health reforms, they talk about a bungalow,"" former Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia was quoted as saying by news agency IANS.""They will never address issues like law and order or illegal encroachments by the DDA. Instead, they mislead the public with baseless claims.

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday told his party MPs not to react to comments of ""middle- and low-rung"" leaders from the INDIA bloc while asserting that the Congress party, being the largest in the alliance, was capable of addressing issues.The sources told news agency PTI that Rahul Gandhi, who chaired a meeting of the party's Lok Sabha MPs at Parliament Annexe this morning, also told the MPs to ensure that all of them are present for the party's protest ahead of the Parliament sittings, especially when Congress president is participating.The Lok Sabha leader of the opposition's advice to his party members comes amid several of his allies, directly or passively, expressing willingness for someone beyond the Congress fold to lead the anti-BJP INDIA bloc. The one name that most of them have approved is of West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee Demand for someone else to lead the INDIA bloc gained ground after Congress faced a massive rout in the Maharashtra elections.As the tension simmers in the opposition alliance, Rahul Gandhi assured the protests by opposition on the Adani issue was making the government jittery and they must continue to raise people's issues.The leader of the opposition in Lok Sabha stressed that he wanted the House to function so that opposition voice is heard, party sources said.Wayanad MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra is also learned to have urged MPs to come up with innovative ideas for protest as had been seen in the past few days.Soon after the meeting, several opposition MPs demonstrated over the Adani issue in Parliament premises, carrying black 'jholas' (bags) with caricatures of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and billionaire Gautam Adani printed on it and 'Modi Adani Bhai Bhai' written on the obverse side.Opposition MPs led by Rahul Gandhi on Monday staged a protest and also a mock ""interview"" over the the Adani issue to corner the BJP-led NDA government.Wearing masks, two opposition MPs impersonated Prime Minister Narendra Modi and billionaire Gautam Adani, responding to questions posed by Rahul Gandhi.","Congress leader Rahul Gandhi told his party MPs not to react to comments of ""middle- and low-rung"" leaders from the INDIA bloc.

Rahul's Adani focus, Congress unilateralism rile INDIA allies

NEW DELHI/PATNA: RJD chief Lalu Prasad on Tuesday endorsed Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee 's desire to take over the reins of INDIA bloc from Congress, days after Sharad Pawar too had backed her.""Congress's reservations (on this) amount to nothing. Mamata ko do (give her the leadership role),"" Lalu said.Congress, though, played down the issue. At a meeting with party MPs, leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi is learnt to have advised them to ignore what is seen by the party to be a ""media-manufactured"" issue and mere ""posturing"" by allies.Though Lalu supported Mamata's claim to lead the anti-BJP alliance , it may be recalled he had consistently backed Congress since the days when Sonia Gandhi was struggling to shake off the ""foreigner"" tag.Other allies of Congress, such as Shiv Sena (UBT) and SP , have made few bones of their reservations about Congress continuing to lead the opposition alliance despite having been consistently underwhelming in election contests since the LS polls where it significantly improved its tally.YSR Congress, which is not part of INDIA group, too reiterated support for Mamata, calling her the ""most capable leader to lead the bloc"".There have been palpable signs of uneasiness with Congress's unilateralism in deciding priorities of the alliance. Allies are also upset with Rahul's fixation with the Adani issue which, many feel, has deprived them of the opportunity to use Parliament to seek to corner govt on issues like inflation which, they maintain, resonate better with people. Congress's poor performance in Maharashtra, Haryana and J&K and its manifest inability to be competitive against BJP in direct contests have weakened its case to be the natural leader of the opposition alliance.Considering that INDIA bloc, despite having Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge as its president, is not a structured entity and does not have a secretariat or a programme of action agreed upon by all stakeholders, Mamata's claim appears to be a challenge to Congress's ""size matters"" assertion and to make the intra-alliance equations more symmetrical.Congress is not pleased and its annoyance with Lalu came to the fore, with Congress secretary Shahnawaz Alam saying the party deserved to lead the alliance by virtue of its sheer strength.""Lalu ji is known to say lots of things casually. Let him place on record his views whenever INDIA bloc holds meeting. What does he mean by saying there should be a leadership change? Does he want Rahul to be replaced as LoP , a post our representative holds by virtue of the party's strength in LS?"" he asked.","RJD chief Lalu Prasad endorsed Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee's desire to take over the reins of INDIA bloc from Congress.

BELAGAVI: A demonstration by Lingayat Panchamasali community near the Suvarna Vidhana Soudha in Karnataka's Belagavi on Tuesday, demanding reservation under 2A category, turned violent, with 50 protesters suffering injuries as they clashed with police.The Panchamasali are currently placed in the 3B category that offers 5% reservation in govt jobs and education, while 2A has 15% quota earmarked for the communities included in the category.During the 'Sangharsh Yatre' called by Basavajaya Mrityunjaya Swamiji, the spiritual head of the movement, thousands of members from the community, including lawyers and politicians, marched from Kondasakoppa towards the Vidhana Soudha, blocking the Pune-Bengaluru National Highway for more than an hour and creating a tailback over 6 km.As the protesters tried to force their way past police barricades, cops resorted to lathi-charge. The angry protesters retaliated by throwing stones and footwear at the police personnel, and shouted slogans against state govt and chief minister Siddaramaiah Police briefly detained Mrityunjaya Swamiji, Vijayapura MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal and Dharwad legislator Arvind Bellad, along with some of the agitators, to restore normality.Before the march started, a ministerial delegation visited the Kondasakoppa protest site and requested the community members to withdraw the agitation. However, the agitators demanded that the CM should visit the spot, or else they would storm into the Vidhana Soudha.Later, responding to media queries at the Suvarna Vidhana Soudha, Siddaramaiah said: ""We invited the Panchamasali leaders to discuss the issue, but they didn't turn up. We are not opposed to protests as everybody has the right to protest in a democracy.""Meanwhile, factionalism within state BJP was out in the open during the protest. As Yatnal's followers shouted slogans against BJP state president B Y Vijayendra, party MLA Siddu Savadi took them on, resulting in heated arguments between the two sides. Police had to intervene to bring the situation under control.In further embarrassment for the party, when BJP Rajya Sabha MP Iranna Kadadi praised former CM B S Yediyurappa in his speech, the agitators started shouting ""sullu sullu"" (false false).","Demonstration by Lingayat Panchamasali community near Suvarna Vidhana Soudha in Karnataka's Belagavi turned violent, with 50 protesters suffering injuries as they clashed with police.

CHANDIGARH: Following a rap on the knuckles by Punjab and Haryana HC, Patiala police have booked Sikh preacher Ranjit Singh Dhadrianwale , who heads a prominent dera in Punjab, on charges of rape and murder of a woman in 2012.The FIR was registered on Dec 7 under IPC sections 302 (murder), 376 (rape) and 506 (criminal intimidation), based on a complaint lodged by the deceased woman's brother on May 24, 2012. Police have also issued show-cause notices to the then SHO, Ashok Kumar, who is now an SP-rank officer, and then DSP Sewa Singh, who later retired as SP, for negligence in the matter by not taking any action on the complaint received in the case 12 years ago.In his petition before HC, the victim's brother had sought a fair investigation by CBI or an SIT headed by a IPS officer into the circumstances leading to the death of his sister, who was allegedly raped and poisoned inside the Dhadrianwale dera. The petitioner alleged that poison was detected in the postmortem report, but police had taken no action to date.","Ranjit Singh Dhadrianwale heads a prominent dera in Punjab.

RAIPUR: Supreme Court Tuesday dismissed Centre's appeal against an order upholding reinstatement of Chhattisgarh-cadre IPS officer Gurjinder Pal Singh , who was compulsorily retired following allegations of sedition, extortion and disproportionate assets.SC noted Singh was subjected to a classic case of political vendetta to settle political scores, and has cleared the path for his reinstatement, his counsel Yasharth Shukla told TOI.Singh was the ADGP when the FIRs were filed against him. The anti-corruption bureau claimed to have found sensitive documents and unexplained assets at Singh's premises in July 2021, leading to his suspension and subsequent dismissal. Singh consistently maintained the allegations were politically motivated, a stance validated by Chhattisgarh HC last month.In April 2024, Central Administrative Tribunal quashed Singh's retirement and ordered his reinstatement. CAT noted that 2 kg of gold was planted, and false and seditious material were fabricated to implicate Singh in false cases. In Aug, Delhi HC dismissed a petition by Centre against CAT order. And on Nov 13, Chhattisgarh HC quashed all three FIRs against the 1994-batch officer, observing that they seem to have been filed to harass him.Centre had challenged CAT reinstatement order in SC, saying the order of compulsory retirement was passed as per rules, in public interest, & CAT acted beyond its jurisdiction.","Gurjinder Pal Singh was compulsorily retired following allegations of sedition, extortion and disproportionate assets.

'Polarising elections': BJP slams AIMIM for fielding Delhi riot accused Tahir Hussain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/bjp-slams-aimim-for-fielding-tahir-hussain-accuses-party-of-polarising-delhi-elections/articleshow/116194970.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday criticised the All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM) for nominating former Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) councillor Tahir Hussain as its candidate for the upcoming Delhi assembly elections.Hussain, who is currently in judicial custody is accused of being a key conspirator in the 2020 Delhi riots .BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra condemned the move, alleging that it was a deliberate strategy to communalise the elections.""Tahir Hussain was a conspirator behind the deadly 2020 Delhi riots and is behind bars now. Such a person has been given a ticket by Asaduddin Owaisi 's party AIMIM for the Delhi elections. This is a conspiracy to polarise the elections on the lines of Hindu-Muslim,"" Patra stated.Patra also took a swipe at AAP, questioning its stance on the development. ""What does AAP think of this, the party who was defending Tahir Hussain initially?"" he asked.The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) responded by accusing the BJP of using AIMIM to divide the opposition vote, a strategy it claimed had worked in the past.AAP spokesperson Priyanka Kakkar said, ""It's a part of the BJP's negative strategy. Wherever BJP starts losing, they bring more parties to contest elections. They (BJP) brought BSP and AIMIM in the Lok Sabha elections. When you see the data, it shows that whenever AIMIM fielded its candidates, it has benefited the BJP.""Congress also weighed in on the issue, with party spokesperson Supriya Shrinate criticising AIMIM's role in past elections.Speaking to ANI, Shrinate said, ""Regarding AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi, we neither fielded him in elections nor supported his actions. His political moves often end up benefiting the BJP. Looking at past data, his involvement in elections has frequently polarised voters, indirectly aiding the BJP.""The Delhi unit of the BJP was particularly vocal in its criticism.BJP vice president Kapil Mishra denounced the decision to field Hussain from the Mustafabad assembly constituency, calling it an attempt to incite communal divisions. Mishra took to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to express his outrage.""Tahir Hussain, who had plotted the murder of hundreds of Hindus in Delhi, in whose house bombs, stones, and slingshots were kept to kill Hindus, and who killed IB officer Ankit Sharma by stabbing him 400 times and throwing his body in the drain, is now being fielded in the election. An attempt is being made to challenge the Hindus of Delhi by fielding such Jihadis. If any attempt is made to start riots in Delhi again, your seven generations will bear the consequences,"" Mishra wrote.He accused Asaduddin Owaisi and his party of ""promoting divisive politics"" by nominating a candidate who is under trial for multiple riot-related cases, including the murder of Intelligence Bureau officer Ankit Sharma.Owaisi officially announced Hussain's candidacy on X, stating, ""MCD Councillor Tahir Hussain joined @aimim_national & will be our candidate from Mustafabad Assembly Constituency in the upcoming Delhi Vidhan Sabha elections. His family members and supporters met with me today and joined the party.""Despite being in judicial custody, Hussain is expected to contest the elections from jail, a move that has sparked sharp criticism from opposition parties and political observers alike.","Tahir Hussain is accused of being a key conspirator in the 2020 Delhi riots.
