BENGALURU: Congress government in Karnataka Saturday constituted an SIT to probe allegations of large-scale deletion of voter names from the electoral rolls in Kalaburagi district's Aland assembly constituency during the 2023 state election.The SIT was formed after Aland Congress MLA B R Patil lodged a police complaint alleging that the names of 6,670 voters across 256 polling stations were unlawfully deleted. Verification by election officers revealed that applications were filed for deletion of 6,018 voters, but only 24 were genuine.

(Inputs from New Delhi)

BENGALURU: Karnataka State Backward Classes Commission has removed 57 Christian sub-castes from the socio-educational survey beginning Monday, following objections from ministers, protests by SC/ST and OBC groups, and a suggestion by governor Thaawar Chand Gehlot.The decision means the survey questionnaire will not list sub-castes. Enumerators using a mobile app between Sept 22 and Oct 7 will record such responses under ""others"". Officials said respondents may still disclose their original caste before conversion, but those entries will also be filed under ""others"".CM Siddaramaiah asked the commission to exclude the names after the governor warned the list could deepen divides. Opposition BJP had objected, alleging the exercise could dilute the anti-conversion law and extend reservations to converted Christians.""The new nomenclature will normalise conversion and encourage the gullible to convert without fear of losing caste identity,"" Karnataka BJP Minorities Morcha president Anil Thomas said Saturday.Samajika Nyaya Jagriti Vedike president S Harish accused Congress govt of plotting ""to integrate Christians into Hindu OBC communities"" and of ""labelling Hindu communities as Christians"".Backward classes welfare minister Shiavaraj Tangadagi countered that govt had not assigned labels: ""During Kantharaju Commission survey, participants voluntarily identified themselves as such. The confusion was sorted out.""Siddaramaiah sought to cool tensions: ""This survey is to capture social and educational backwardness of people and to find out their religion. If someone is a practising Christian, the person will be listed as Christian and not in terms of caste.""Congress is confident Karnataka's survey will follow Telangana's model, with no rollback on the broader policy.","Karnataka State Backward Classes Commission has removed 57 Christian sub-castes from the socio-educational survey beginning Monday.

Bihar polls announcement likely in first week of October,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-polls-announcement-likely-in-first-week-of-october/articleshow/124021032.cms,"Caste data may fuel demand for sub-categories within OBCs

NEW DELHI: Election Commission is likely to announce the dates for the Bihar polls, which may be conducted in two phases, in the first week of October.The high-stakes showdown will test the governing NDA, led by CM Nitish Kumar , against a charged opposition, which is already in battle mode with Rahul Gandhi conducting a state-wide yatra against alleged vote theft, and RJD neta Tejashwi now leading another focused on unemployment and alleged corruption.This is Bihar's first state poll since Nitish government's landmark caste count in 2023, which has ignited fierce debates on social justice, reservations and power-sharing.For NDA, the elections are a chance to defy voter fatigue with a CM who has been at the helm for two decades now.Bihar’s elections have largely been fought along the fault lines of caste and the forthcoming round is unlikely to buck the pattern. The caste survey may have only sharpened the battle lines.Conducted under Nitish’s watch, it revealed that Other Backward Classes (OBCs) and Extremely Backward Classes (EBCs) comprise 63% of the population, with Yadavs at 14%, EBCs at 36%, and others, such as Kushwahas and Kurmis, accounting for the rest. SCs comprise 19%, while the upper castes account for 15%.Many groups among Muslims, who have a share of 17% in the population, are categorised as OBCs, but they mostly vote along community lines.Armed with this data, govt hiked reservations from 50% to 65% for jobs and education, plus 10% for economically weaker sections.The move, supposed to win over the numerically dominant “backwards”, was stayed by Patna HC but helped Nitish further fortify his credentials as a champion of OBCs. Centre’s surprise nod to a national caste census in April 2025, announced by BJP-led government, has added fresh fuel to the fire. Once wary of the demand, the Modi govt embraced it after concluding that doing so would defang what had become the chief plank of the opposition and prevent it from reversing the momentum for Hindu consolidation.The data could fuel demand for sub-categorisation within OBCs. Barring a sharp deviation from the historical pattern, the elections are likely to be shaped by the caste factor, and in this regard the NDA does not appear to be especially disadvantaged vis-àvis the rival combination if it manages to prevent the newcomer Jan Suraj from eating into its upper-caste votes.","Bihar's elections have largely been fought along the fault lines of caste.

Rahul Gandhi Reveals '100% Proof Of Vote Chori', Accuses CEC Gyanesh Of Protecting Vote Thief

Poll body refutes Rahul's claim

NEW DELHI: The Congress-led Karnataka government on Saturday constituted a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe into the ""vote deletion"" in the Aland assembly segment.The move by the state government comes days after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi accused Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar of protecting ""vote chors"" and people who have destroyed democracy.Displaying data of Aland on a big screen during the press conference, Rahul Gandhi claimed that the votes of Congress supporters were being systematically deleted ahead of elections.""I am going to show the youth, the people, proof that is black and white, absolutely clear that Chief Election Commissioner of India is protecting people who have destroyed Indian democracy. I will also show you the methods by which votes are added, deleted and show you how it is done,"" Rahul Gandhi said.He alleged that a group of people is using a centralised method through software and impersonating real voters, and deleting their names from the voter lists.""In Aland, Karnataka, 6018 votes, somebody tried to delete these votes. We don't know the total number of votes deleted in the 2023 elections, but somebody got caught. It was caught, by most crimes, by coincidence. What happened was that the Booth Level officer noticed that her uncle's vote had been deleted.When she checked, she saw that her neighbour had deleted the vote,"" Gandhi said during the press conference.""When she asked the neighbour, he said that he is not aware of doing such a thing. So neither the neighbour nor the person whose vote was deleted knew. Some other force hijacked the process and deleted the vote. As luck would have it, it got caught,"" he added.The Election Commission on Friday refuted Rahul Gandhi's charges, claiming that ""no deletion of votes can be done online by any member of the public.""The poll body, in a point-wise statement, said that the no name is deleted from the roll without issuing a notice to the affected person.""No Deletion of any vote can be done online by any member of the public. No wrongful deletion of electors in Aland; an FIR was registered by the authority of ECI itself in 2023 against suspicious attempts of deletions,"" it said.""Although the Elector of the constituency can fill Form 7 online to apply for deletion of an entry from that particular constituency, it does not mean that the entry gets automatically deleted merely by submitting the Form 7. As per Registration of Electors Rules, 1960, no name is deleted from the roll without issuing a notice to the affected person and giving him an opportunity of being heard,"" it added.It further said that the poll body only accepted 24 applications of deletion and 5,994 incorrect applications were rejected ahead of the assembly election in Aland. It also said a inquiry was conducted & subsequently an FIR was registered by Electoral Registration Officer, Aland""In the case of Aland, Karnataka, 6,018 applications in Form 7 for deletion were submitted online. On verification, only 24 applications were found to be genuine, while 5,994 were found to be incorrect. Accordingly, 24 applications were accepted, and the 5,994 incorrect applications were rejected,"" it said.""Suspecting the genuineness of such a large number of applications for deletion, an inquiry was conducted & subsequently an FIR (No. 26/2023, Aland Police Station, dated 21.02.2023) was registered,"" it added.","Congress-led Karnataka government constituted a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe into the ""vote deletion"" in the Aland assembly segment.

Bihar assembly elections: Two more parties join Mahagathbandhan; seat-sharing deal to get complex?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-assembly-elections-two-more-parties-join-mahagathbandhan-seat-sharing-deal-to-get-complex/articleshow/123756184.cms,"PM Modi’s 'Kosi' Jibe at Opposition Ignites Bihar Election Heat During MP Flats Inauguration

NEW DELHI: The seat-sharing negotiations for upcoming assembly elections in Bihar have become more complex as two new parties - Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and Pashupati Paras's LJP faction - joined the Mahagathbandhan alliance. The situation is getting trickier as major parties are firm on their seat demands.The 243 seats will now be divided among eight parties -- Rashtriya Janata Dal, Congress, CPI, CPM, VIP, LJP (Paras) and JMM.“Two more parties are expected to be part of the INDIA bloc soon and we all have to sacrifice our share of seats to accommodate the new partners.” State Congress president Rajesh Kumar told reporters after a discussion during a key meeting of INDIA bloc leaders at the official residence of RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav.Meanwhile, Congress insist that it cannot go below the 70 seats.VIP chief Mukesh Sahani, on the other hand, has demanded “60 seats plus the post of deputy CM” while the CPI-ML is pressing for at least 40 seats, pointing to its past performance.The RJD is also unwilling to contest on fewer than 150 seats.In 2020 assembly elections, Rashtriya Janata Dal had contested on 144 seats, of which it won 75.Congress won 19 out of 70 seats.CPI-ML contested 19 seats and won 12.CPM contested 4 seats and was successful in winning 2 seats.CPI contested on 6 seats and won 2 seats.RJD's Tejashwi Yadav has already declared himself as the CM face of the opposition INDIA bloc.Addressing the rally in Ara town, the last stopover of the 'Voter Adhikar Yatra', Tejashwi questioned the Nitish Kumar government in Bihar for ""frequently copying his ideas"" and described it as a ""copycat government"". Ridiculing the government for copying his ideas, he said that at present he was moving ahead while the govt was behind him.""Tejashwi aage-aage, Sarkar pichhe-pichhe. Original CM chahiye ki duplicate?"" (Tejashwi is moving ahead while the govt is following him from behind. Do you want a duplicate CM or the original CM?), Tejashwi asked the crowd.","Two new parties - Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and Pashupati Paras's LJP faction - joined the Mahagathbandhan alliance.
