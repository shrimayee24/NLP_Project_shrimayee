Assam Bids Final Farewell To Zubeen Garg As Wife Garima Breaks Down By His Pyre

Zubeen’s aides booked for culpable homicide not amounting to murder

GUWAHATI: Two fugitive prime accused in the probe into Zubeen Garg’s death were arrested before dawn on Wednesday and sent to police custody for 14 days, while the music icon’s 13th-day mourning rituals drew massive crowds in Jorhat, with fans crying for justice.North East India Festival organiser Shyamkanu Mahanta was detained by immigration officers at New Delhi airport around 12.30am after arriving from Singapore on the basis of an Interpol lookout notice, officials said, and handed to Assam police. An hour later, Garg’s manager Siddharth Sharma was caught near the Delhi-Haryana border in Gurgaon.Both were flown to Guwahati, produced before the chief judicial magistrate at the judge’s residence due to Durga Puja court closures, and remanded in police custody for 14 days.Security was tightened at Guwahati airport, along the convoy route, and at the magistrate’s residence, with Assam police and RAF personnel deployed. Photographs released by police showed Mahanta and Sharma in handcuffs inside a police van. DGP Harmeet Singh said: “The investigation is progressing well.”Assam police’s SIT has charged the duo with conspiracy, culpable homicide not amounting to murder, and causing death by negligence.“Interrogation has started and we are going to do everything as per law,” said Munna Prasad Gupta, special DGP (CID) heading the nine-member SIT. He said investigators had seized the two men’s mobile phones along with Garg’s own handset, which was with his manager.Over 60 FIRs have been filed demanding a full probe, 55 of them naming four men: Mahanta; manager Sharma, an employee of a Mumbai-based talent management firm; drummer Shekharjyoti Goswami, and businessman Sanjive Narain.SIT has interrogated Goswami, the singer’s cousin and police officer Sandipon Garg, actress Nishita Goswami, and singer-actress Amritprabha, all of whom were in Singapore at the time. Interpol lookout notices were earlier circulated for Mahanta and Sharma after they ignored SIT summons to appear before Oct 6.Garg’s widow Garima Saikia Garg said in Jorhat she was relieved the duo had been brought to Assam. “We are all waiting to know what happened to him in his last moments,” she said. In her FIR, she alleged Mahanta failed to provide security, medical support, or proper accommodation for Garg in Singapore.","North East India Festival organiser Shyamkanu Mahanta was detained by immigration officers at New Delhi airport.

NEW DELHI: The seat-sharing negotiations for upcoming assembly elections in Bihar have become more complex as two new parties - Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and Pashupati Paras's LJP faction - joined the Mahagathbandhan alliance. The situation is getting trickier as major parties are firm on their seat demands.The 243 seats will now be divided among eight parties -- Rashtriya Janata Dal, Congress, CPI, CPM, VIP, LJP (Paras) and JMM.“Two more parties are expected to be part of the INDIA bloc soon and we all have to sacrifice our share of seats to accommodate the new partners.” State Congress president Rajesh Kumar told reporters after a discussion during a key meeting of INDIA bloc leaders at the official residence of RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav.Meanwhile, Congress insist that it cannot go below the 70 seats.VIP chief Mukesh Sahani, on the other hand, has demanded “60 seats plus the post of deputy CM” while the CPI-ML is pressing for at least 40 seats, pointing to its past performance.The RJD is also unwilling to contest on fewer than 150 seats.In 2020 assembly elections, Rashtriya Janata Dal had contested on 144 seats, of which it won 75.Congress won 19 out of 70 seats.CPI-ML contested 19 seats and won 12.CPM contested 4 seats and was successful in winning 2 seats.CPI contested on 6 seats and won 2 seats.RJD's Tejashwi Yadav has already declared himself as the CM face of the opposition INDIA bloc.Addressing the rally in Ara town, the last stopover of the 'Voter Adhikar Yatra', Tejashwi questioned the Nitish Kumar government in Bihar for ""frequently copying his ideas"" and described it as a ""copycat government"". Ridiculing the government for copying his ideas, he said that at present he was moving ahead while the govt was behind him.""Tejashwi aage-aage, Sarkar pichhe-pichhe. Original CM chahiye ki duplicate?"" (Tejashwi is moving ahead while the govt is following him from behind. Do you want a duplicate CM or the original CM?), Tejashwi asked the crowd.","Two new parties - Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and Pashupati Paras's LJP faction - joined the Mahagathbandhan alliance.
