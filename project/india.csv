What is your biggest challenge as a lone candidate of

TMC

in UP?

What made you pick Bhadohi over Mirzapur where you have a stronger base?

How well has the alliance worked for you?

TMC and Congress aren’t on great terms in West Bengal. Did you draw flak on this account?

Is Mamata Banerjee keeping an eye on your election, or are you by yourself?

Any direct interaction with Mamata Banerjee on election?

What are your poll promises?

How well are you placed in the constituency?

Trinamool Congress ’s lone candidate in UP ,, who is contesting from Bhadohi as INDIA bloc pick, is confident of his victory. Talking to, he spoke about the challenges and poll prospects. Excerpts:When we started out two-and-a-half months ago, the common suggestion was that I should contest on Samajwadi Party’s symbol, but I kept reinforcing and the challenge of people not knowing my party’s symbol was eventually won over.We were careful about the selection of words that connected with the people to describe the symbol as ‘phool’ (flower) is normally used by the BJP in the Hindi belt. We used ‘Do daali aur chhe patti wala phool’ to help voters recall the symbol.Mirzapur was my first choice and I have a personal connection with that seat. But I accepted the decision of the leadership. Bhadohi is also not new to me because of my familial association. Bhadohi was one of the safest seats that SP could offer to TMC. Soon, I realised that most constituencies are the same and the strategy to reach out to voters should be tweaked according to hyperlocal needs. We did extensive visits to establish connections with voters.I am an INDIA bloc candidate and have all the support from members of constituent parties. Though it took some time for the alliance dharma to trickle down but when it did, it worked like well-oiled machinery. AAP, which has a small presence in this region, started working on its own. Akhilesh Yadav’s rally pulled people from neighbouring constituencies as well.Initially, there was some hesitation, but when instructions came from the high command, problems were ironed out.We send regular updates and get questions/suggestions and feedback from her end. She also sent TMC MP Nadim-ul-Haque as her emissary, and recently, Rajya Sabha member Sushmita Dev also camped here. She also sent a couple of MLAs to oversee activities.Yes. We planned a mega rally but then we realised that the sixth phase was crucial for the party in West Bengal, and she was more needed there.I have kept Nyay Patra and Samajwadi Party manifesto as the base and picked up points from them besides listing out local issues like a university in the district, need for a better system to facilitate carpet export and promote skill development opportunities.If we keep Akhilesh Yadav’s rally as a reference point, as compared to 2019 or 2022 elections, people are listening more carefully to what the INDIA bloc leaders are saying. During campaigning, I realised that the alliance manifesto has percolated with more clarity than Modi’s guarantee. In fact, people of this constituency are fighting elections as they feel that the double engine has failed them on various fronts. The BJP is not sure of its candidate for the seat. Three different candidates have contested on the BJP ticket since 2014. People want to give a chance to someone other than the BJP candidate.","Trinamool Congress’s lone candidate in UP, who is contesting from Bhadohi as INDIA bloc pick, is confident of his victory.

How do you see the political issues churning up nationally this election?

The BJP leadership is spinning the political narrative around Hindutva. Don’t you think the election is going on a communal track?

Are you dissociating yourself with the BJP’s campaign line?

Then how do you tend to go about it?

Do you prefer keeping a very low profile while connecting with people?

What’s your opinion about BJP taking on Congress in Rae Bareli and Amethi calling for making them “Parivar mukt”.

You have been associated with the BJP for over two decades. How much has the party changed over the time?

Didn’t it hurt when your son Varun who himself has been an MP, was benched by the BJP?

Varun has been missing from action ever since he was denied a ticket. Will he campaign?

What future do you see for Varun?

You said that Sultanpur is your only focus. What kinds of problems do people come up with and do you go about it?

The BJP leaders keep raising the Ram Temple issue. PM Narendra Modi has been cornering opposition for not attending Ram Temple consecration ceremony. How do you see the overall issue?

And for me issues in Sultanpur are purely local.Not here in Sultanpur.I don’t dissociate or associate myself. I just want to stay with people in Sultanpur. My objective here is to see what people want here.See, there is no need to create big problems when there are none. We have tendencies to create big issues for nothing. We have no big issues here. People just want to remain connected with their elected representatives (MPs and MLAs).That’s the only way I work.Seriously, I just don’t want to get into this. I just don’t want to comment on them at all. I never comment on other seats and other parties and their leaders. Rae Bareli and Amethi are not an issue here in Sultanpur.You know, all political parties adapt themselves to leaders. So as the leader comes there is an adaptive change in a party and its organisation.Let’s just finish it off. I just can’t keep feeling the pain.I do expect him to campaign here soon.I see a very bright future for him. And I am sure he will work very hard for it. A party does not depend only on MPs. In fact, most of the leaders in BJP are not MPs.They often come up with bizarre problems. There is a man who wants the body of his wife exhumed. I don’t tell a lie. Everybody’s work is done. And if it is not done then it is explained as to why it could not be done.It is not an issue here. Ram Mandir is in everybody’s heart.

"In Ghatal, two actors and a worn-out flood-relief script",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-ghatal-two-actors-and-a-worn-out-flood-relief-script/articleshow/110347149.cms,"GHATAL: Ghatal’s annual tryst with floods is a hot-button issue that crops up every elections and is put on the back burner after voting. The Ghatal Master Plan was proposed way back in 1959 to bring relief to people living in the lowlying areas in and around the Ghatal sub-division of West Bengal. It took Planning Commission 20 years to okay the plan and its foundation was finally laid in 1982 — the year Trinamool Congress ’s Ghatal candidate Dev was born and his BJP opponent, former Tollywood co-star Hiraan , was all of six.Today, Dev is 41, Hiraan 47, and the proposed master plan, a sepiatinged 65. The lack of its implementation continues to dominate the poll discourse this year too.Considered among the country’s most flood-prone zones, the Ghatal sub-division is located 120km from Kolkata. It lies in the catchment area of the rain-fed Shilabati and Jhumi rivers at the base of the Chhota Nagpur plateau. Boats and canoes replace vehicles as flood waters inundate farmlands, roads and homes, destroying standing crops and displacing people.In 1982, Rs 50 crore was allocated to the plan after it was sanctioned. Today, it is a Rs 1,250-crore project that promises to benefit 17 lakh people across 12 blocks in West and East Midnapore districts by making the rivers navigable, clearing canals and ponds, setting up drainage facilities and pumping stations and building barrages, dams and bridges.According to the earlier plan, Centre was to bear 60% of its cost, and the state govt the rest.Unable to get the project on track, Dev had given up hope and even contemplated quitting politics. But in Feb 2023, CM Mamata Banerjee and party general secretary Abhishek Banerjee stepped in, announcing that if Centre does not fund the project, the state will fund it entirely. A survey will be conducted, and the first tranche of funds will be released before yearend, the CM promised.Hiraan, a PhD in rural development and a post-doctoral researcher at IIT Kharagpur, has not lost sight of the issue. While he has repeatedly stressed that Centre will fund this project, he questions the intent of Dev and the Mamata govt behind raking up the issue only during polls and not after.Dev has been Ghatal’s MP since 2014. It is also a fact that Bengal has been pressing the issue with Centre, but in vain. In his first speech as a Lok Sabha MP in Aug 2016, and his last in Feb 2024, he urged Centre to help mitigate Ghatal’s recurring flood crisis. Ghatal Master Plan figures in every election speech he has made since his nomination was announced by Trinamool on March 10.The battle for Ghatal has also led to an intense off-screen rivalry between Dev and Hiraan, who is also the sitting BJP MLA from Kharagpur.Hiraan’s relentless personal attacks on Dev, an actor with a huge fan following in Bengal, has been an electoral campaign fixture.If Keshpur, where Dev’s extended family lives, votes as it did in 2019, it will be an easy victory for him. Of his 1 lakh-plus victory margin on Ghatal LS seat, Keshpur assembly segment alone gave him a 92,000-vote lead. However, in the 2021 assembly elections, Trinamool’s Siuli Saha could win by a margin of only 20,000 votes.Keshpur grabbed headlines in 1998 following violent clashes between CPM and Trinamool Congress over control of the area, marking the first time Trinamool made inroads into the once-impregnable red bastion of CPM.However, since 2019, BJP has made significant inroads into Ghatal. In the 2021 assembly elections, BJP won the Ghatal seat. The saffron party secured a 41% vote share in the 2019 Lok Sabha contest in Ghatal against Trinamool’s 48%.","The Ghatal Master Plan was proposed way back in 1959 to bring relief to people living in the lowlying areas.

Minor's bail sparks outrage

NEW DELHI: Pune court has sent the minor's father to 2-day police custody till May 24 after his 17-year-old son rammed his Porsche into a motorcyle from behind, resulting in the death of 2 young techies.This comes after Pune crime branch team on Tuesday morning detained the father of the teenage driver involved in Sunday’s fatal accident that killed two techies in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar.The father, a prominent builder, is facing charges of giving his son his high-end car to drive despite knowing that the latter did not have a driving licence nor was he trained to drive the car and that his son consumed alcohol. The builder was detained from a lodge in Sambhajinagar, while his driver and associate were picked from a hotel.The builder attempted to outsmart the cops after fleeing the city. He sent one of his vehicles towards Mumbai and another to Goa. He borrowed a vehicle from an associate but it had a GPS fitted in it.The accident occurred around 2.30am on Sunday when the Porsche Taycan, driven by the 17-year-old at 160kmph speed at the time of the crash, rammed into a motorcycle from behind in Kalyaninagar. The collision claimed the lives of Anish Awadhia and Ashwini Kosta, both 24-year-old techies hailing from Madhya Pradesh.Before the accident, the teen along with his friends drank alcohol at two pubs in the city - Cosie and Blak Mariott. He spent Rs 48,000 in 90 minutes at Cosie which the teen and his friends visited at 10.40pm on Saturday evening. They left for the second pub, Blak Mariott, at 12.10am after Cosie stopped serving them.The police also arrested Naman Bhutada (25), the owner of the Cosie pub in Mundhwa, and Sachin Kaatkar (35), a staff member at the establishment. Additionally, Sandip Sangle (35), an assistant restaurant manager at the Blak Marriott pub, also located in Mundhwa, has been taken into custody. The minor driver had reportedly visited these establishments to party with his friends before the fateful accident.The teenage driver was arrested by the police, but within 15 hours, he was granted bail by Pune's Juvenile Justice Board (JJB), which also rejected the police's request for his trial as an adult. The bail conditions set by the JJB, which included writing a 300-word essay on accidents, painting traffic awareness boards, working with a traffic constable, and attending counseling, sparked outrage among the public. Even Maharashtra deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis expressed shock at the bail conditions, calling them ""shocking and surprising"" and suggesting that the order needs to be reviewed.","Pune court has sent the minor's father to 2-day police custody till May 24 after his 17-year-old son rammed his Porsche into a motorcyle from behind, resulting in the death of 2 young techies.

No legal mandate to make final turnout data of all booths public: EC to SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-legal-mandate-to-make-final-turnout-data-of-all-booths-public-ec-to-sc/articleshow/110343080.cms,"Mala fide effort to keep on raising suspicion, says SC

NEW DELHI: Election Commission on Wednesday told Supreme Court in an affidavit that there was no legal mandate to provide final voter turnout data of all polling stations to any person other than the candidate or his/her agents. The poll panel also said giving out final voter turnout numbers based on Form 17C would lead to ""confusion among voters as it will also include postal ballot counts"", while pointing out that turnout data of each polling booth is shared with polling agents of candidates on the day of voting itself.The EC filed the affidavit in response to the application by NGO ' Association for Democratic Reforms ' (ADR), which has sought that final voter turnout figures of all polling stations be made public in 48 hours.""ADR's application ignores the disclaimer to the effect that the figures in the non-statutory voter turnout app is secondary data and is only provisional in nature,"" EC said.Election Commission accused the NGO 'Association for Democratic Reforms' (ADR) of ""trying to create entitlement when none exists in the law by way of filing an application in the middle of an election period"". ""In any electoral contest, the margin of victory may be very close. In such cases, disclosure of Form 17C in public domain may cause confusion in the minds of voters with regard to the total votes polled as the latter figure would include the number of votes polled as per Form 17C as well as the votes received through postal ballots . However, such difference may not be easily understood by voters and may be used by persons with motivated interests to cast aspersion on the whole electoral process... cause chaos in the election machinery which is already in motion,"" the affidavit said.""The voter turnout data is facilitative and a transparency initiative of the commission, in addition to extant statutory design of providing exact turnout data of each polling booth to polling agents of candidates,"" EC added.The poll panel also rebutted allegations of increase in voting percentage days after polling possibly being a sign of change of EVMs and said ""vested interests habitually throw baseless charges"" during elections to create suspicion and discredit the exercise to demotivate voters. ""There are certain elements and vested interests who keep on throwing baseless and false allegations, creating unwarranted atmosphere of suspicion in close proximity of time of conduct of every elections by the EC to somehow discredit the same,"" EC said.It stressed that other countries were looking forward to the efficacy of conduct of elections in the largest democracy where 97 crore voters will exercise their franchise in seven phases, and said, ""There is a consistent mala fide campaign/design/effort to keep on raising suspicion and doubt in every possible manner and by misleading assertions and baseless allegations regarding the conduct of elections.""It said the latest charges from ADR came after a bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Datta on April 26 dismissed its petition seeking return to ballot paper and rejected the NGO's allegations about the efficacy of EVMs. ADR filed the application in its petition, which has been pending since 2019, soon after leaders of Congress, TMC and CPM wrote to EC expressing concern over high increase in voter turnout figures days after phase one and two of the polls. SC will hear the case on May 24.EC relied on SC's six landmark decisions since 1952 reiterating that no petition or application would be entertained by courts during the process of elections and that any grievance about elections has to be made through an election petition after the completion of the process and declaration of results. Hence, the present application by ADR was not maintainable, it said.EC said since five out of seven phases of polling had already taken place, the procedure for declaration of voting percentage could not be changed for the last two phases scheduled for May 25 and June 1. On ADR's plea for uploading constituency - and polling station-wise voter turnout percentage on the EC website, the commission said the issue relating to voting percentage declaration was fully adjudicated by the bench of Justices Khanna and Datta.","EC says there is no legal mandate to provide final voter turnout data of all polling stations to any person other than the candidate or his/her agents.
