"Now, Aurangzeb triggers fight in Bihar NDA",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/now-aurangzeb-triggers-fight-in-bihar-nda/articleshow/118770071.cms,"JD(U) Leader Khalid Anwar

PATNA: After Maharashtra and UP, Aurangzeb lit up Bihar's political pyrotechnics Thursday when JD(U) MLC Khalid Anwar described the Mughal ruler as a ""good king"" and drew scorn from party colleagues and those of governing NDA ally BJP . BJP legislator Hari Bhushan Thakur demanded Anwar's expulsion from the House and called for him to be sent to ""Pakistan or Syria"". JD(U) MLA Sanjeev Kumar called for Anwar to be packed off to Gaza.The political storm erupted after Anwar defended SP MLA Abu Asim Azmi, who was suspended from the Maharashtra assembly on Wednesday for praising Aurangzeb. ""Aurangzeb was not a cruel ruler, but a good king. It is the job of historians to discuss it, not UP CM Yogi Adityanath. Is he a historian?"" Anwar asked.The MLC took another swipe at the UP CM, saying ""Yogi must learn from (JD(U) mascot and Bihar CM) Nitish Kumar how a state is run.""The blowback was swift, with BJP's Thakur leading the charge. ""Aurangzeb was a cruel ruler who imprisoned his father, killed his brothers, destroyed several Hindu temples and raped many women. If any person heaps praises on such a ruler, stern legal action must be initiated against him, be it from JD(U) or my own party,"" Thakur said. The BJP legislator demanded the MLC's disqualification while pushing for renaming places associated with Aurangzeb and Bakhtiyar Khilji in Bihar.","JD(U) MLC Khalid Anwar described the Mughal ruler as a ""good king"" BJP legislator Hari Bhushan Thakur demanded Anwar's expulsion from the House.

Bhagwant Mann vs farmers: Is AAP rethinking its strategy in Punjab?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bhagwant-mann-vs-farmers-is-aap-rethink-its-strategy-in-punjab/articleshow/118759733.cms,"AAP’s political setback and Kejriwal’s absence



NEW DELHI: Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann is taking the farmers head-on, accusing them of ""turning Punjab into a state of protests."" The foiled Chandigarh agitation has now become the latest flashpoint in the escalating standoff.On Wednesday, farmers who had set out in tractors and other vehicles were stopped at multiple entry points, leading to heightened tensions between the protesters and the government.A day earlier, Bhagwant Mann had walked out of a crucial meeting with farm leaders midway, further deepening the confrontation. As protesting farmers were halted, the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) issued a direct warning to Mann, stating that his government ""will not have enough jails if the farmers of Punjab decide to court arrest to protect the democratic rights of the people.""The latest showdown has provided fresh ammunition to opposition parties, including the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has accused the AAP government of ""insulting the annadatas (food providers).""For a party that rode to power in Punjab with the support of farmers — who protested for months against the Centre's farm bills at Delhi’s borders — this apparent U-turn has been striking. The Mann government now finds its relationship with the farming community severely strained.Speaking to the media, Mann defended his stance, stating that his government had to balance the interests of all Punjabis, not just farmers.""I am the custodian of not just the farmers but of Punjab’s 3.5 crore people. The protests were causing inconvenience to traders, businessmen, students, and employees,"" Mann said.The confrontation with farmers comes just days after AAP lost its stronghold in Delhi, allowing the BJP to stage a major comeback in the recent Delhi assembly elections.Adding to the political turmoil, AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal has not been seen in public since the election results were announced. Though he traveled to Punjab for a 10-day Vipassana meditation camp, what grabbed attention was his high-profile convoy.The opposition targeted the Punjab government over Kejriwal’s 21-vehicle cavalcade, which included Punjab Police personnel, accusing him of hypocrisy. The BJP, which successfully countered Kejriwal’s ‘aam aadmi’ (common man) narrative in Delhi with allegations of extravagant spending on ‘Sheesh Mahal’ (glass palace),claimed his Punjab retreat was simply an excuse to enjoy a lavish lifestyle.The Delhi assembly results marked AAP’s second major setback, following its poor performance in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, where it won only three out of 13 parliamentary seats in Punjab. This was in stark contrast to its landslide victory in the 2022 Punjab Assembly elections, where the party won 92 out of 117 seats.The Delhi election results were also seen as a reflection of Mann’s popularity. Despite active campaigning by Mann, his cabinet ministers, MPs, and MLAs, the party failed to improve its standing in the national capital.With Punjab assembly elections just two years away, Mann’s tougher stance on farmers will be closely watched, as it may determine AAP’s future in the state.","Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann is taking the farmers head-on, accusing them of ""turning Punjab into a state of protests"" The foiled Chandigarh agitation has now become the latest flashpoint in the escalating standoff.

JAIPUR/AJMER: Rajasthan high court barred Bijaynagar Municipality in Beawar on Thursday from bulldozing properties linked to suspects in the gangrape and blackmail cases involving five schoolgirls, taking cognisance of allegations that the state govt was ""hell-bent"" on demolitions in contravention of Supreme Court guidelines .Justice Mahendar Goyal's order to maintain status quo came on a petition filed by five people who received demolition notices issued on Feb 20 for alleged violations under sections 194 and 245 of the Rajasthan Municipality Act.Syed Saadat Ali, counsel for the petitioners, accused the administration of overlooking responses to the demolition notices.Ali cited SC guidelines mandating inspections before any demolition and a signed endorsement of any such action by two elected representatives. These safeguards are meant to ensure that ""only unauthorised and non-compoundable constructions are targeted"", he said.The court directed the lawyer to provide a copy of the writ petition to additional advocate general GS Gill and scheduled the next hearing for March 11.Eleven suspects have been arrested and three juveniles detained since three FIRs were registered on Feb 16, based on complaints by the families of the schoolgirls.",Rajasthan high court barred Bijaynagar Municipality in Beawar from bulldozing properties linked to suspects in the gangrape and blackmail cases.

SC bars fresh FIR against Udhayanidhi Stalin over ‘sanatana’ remark,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-bars-fresh-fir-against-udhayanidhi-stalin-over-sanatana-remark/articleshow/118769339.cms,"Udhayanidhi Stalin

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday exempted Tamil Nadu deputy CM Udhayanidhi Stalin from personal appearance in any court relating criminal cases on his controversial ‘Sanatan eradication’ remarks and barred lodging of new FIRs for the same comments at TN Progressive Writers Artists Association at Chennai on Sep 2, 2023.Appearing for Staling Jr, senior advocates A M Singhvi and P Wilson told a bench of Chief Justice Sanjeev Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar that the FIRs could be clubbed at one place to avoid multifarious criminal proceedings arising from the same comment.“The statement of Nupur Sharma is far more offensive. Yet, she got relief from the court,” Singhvi said. Appearing for Maharashtra, where one of the FIRs was lodged against the deputy CM, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said, “Does it behove a deputy CM to call for eradication of ‘ sanatan dharma ’ like mosquitoes, dengue and malaria? Hell would have broken lose had a CM of any other state called for eradication of any other religion, say Islam.”CJI Khanna said SC is not going into merits of the alleged words spoken by Stalin Jr as any opinion expressed by it could impact the trial. “We are only on the issue of whether the cases could be transferred to one place for consolidated proceedings,” the CJI said. The SC had earlier suggested transferring all cases to Karnataka.The SG continued, “Merely because a community which is sought to be eradicated does not react violently or threaten violence, should it be continuously targeted?” Wilson said he would take SG to Tamil Nadu as he does not understand the situation there.Mehta said he is not against Tamil Nadu at all but has strong reservations against the irresponsible words used by a deputy CM against “Sanatan dharma’. Singhvi countered saying the SG is speaking for another audience. Mehta said, “I have no other audience than the SC. My friend conducts press conferences for another audience. I do not have that privilege.” Singhvi said, “The SG is holding one in the court.”After the bench barred registration of further FIRs and continued the exemption from personal appearance of Stalin Jr in any court with regard to proceedings relating to his Sep 2023 comments and posted further hearing on Apr 28, the SG said the SC in Shaheen Abdullah case had taken strong exception to hate speeches by certain Hindu organizations and ordered preventive action as well as empowering police to suo motu register FIRs against those indulging in hate speeches.That matter is pending and the petition by Stalin Jr could be tagged with that, Mehta suggested. This was immediately objected to by Wilson, who said the Abdullah case has nothing to do with the petition by Stalin Jr.Mehta said even for something innocuous, the SC had directed registration of FIR . “Petitions cannot always be filed to target one community which does not react violently to hate speeches made against its religion,” he said.Singhvi and Wilson said Mehta is trying to bring politics into law, when there is nothing in common. SC also refused to tag Stalin Jr’s petition with the pending petitions relating to hate speech.","Tamil Nadu deputy CM Udhayanidhi Stalin exempted from personal appearance in any court relating criminal cases on his controversial ‘Sanatan eradication’ remarks.

KOLKATA: A school once listed as a minority institution would continue to enjoy that status, whether or not it obtained a minority certificate from West Bengal Minorities Commission , a division bench of Calcutta high court ruled on Thursday.""Once a minority, always a minority,"" Chief Justice T S Sivagnanam said, as the bench dismissed a public interest litigation filed in 2019, which pleaded that schools run by West Bengal Association of Christian Schools could not claim minority status because the association had not applied to the commission for renewal of minority status.The CJ observed that the petitioner was evidently unaware of the Supreme Court judgments with regard to interpretations of Article 30(1) of the Constitution. He cited a 1988 SC judgment, which ruled that ""a school which is otherwise a minority school would continue to be so. The declaration (by the state) is only an acceptance of a legal character antecedent to the said declaration.""""The settled legal position is that you can't insist on a listed minority body to go to govt and apply for a minority certificate,"" CJ Sivagnanam said.The HC noted that Rule 33 of Management Rules-1969, which provides that such schools may apply for a certificate, was omitted in 2008, and observed: ""The omission of Rule 33 will not in any manner affect the right of the West Bengal Association of Christian Schools. State govt made special rules for the minority-run private institutions conferred to them under Article(s) 26 and 30 of the Constitution.""The respondent schools pleaded that the Christian schools had been set up and administered since 1800, and were listed as minority institutions years before West Bengal Minorities Commission came into being.The bench, also comprising Justice Chaitali Chatterjee (Das), expressed ""serious doubt"" about the bona fides of the petitioner, a social worker engaged in imparting education to the poor and downtrodden in rural areas.","Calcutta high court rules that a school once listed as a minority institution would continue to enjoy that status.
