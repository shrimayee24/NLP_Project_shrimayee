COIMBATORE: More than six years after serial gangrapes in Pollachi rocked Tamil Nadu, a mahila court in Coimbatore on Tuesday found all the nine suspects guilty of gangrape and handed them imprisonment for life till death. It also directed the state govt to pay compensation of 85 lakh to the eight survivors.Coimbatore mahila court judge R Nandhini Devi, concurring with the CBI prosecutor's submissions, read out the verdict convicting all the nine and sentencing a few of them to double life imprisonment The nine men were found guilty of luring several young women, including college girls, with the promise of marriage, taking them to a secluded house and gang-raping them over a long period. They videographed the acts to threaten the survivors later.The atrocity came to light after a 19-year-old woman from a village near Pollachi came forward to lodge a police complaint in Feb 2019.Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) took over after the local police bungled the probe and made public personal details of a survivor.Immediately after the verdict was out, the Salem city armed reserve police escorted the accused - N Sabarirajan alias Rishwanth, 32, of Jothi Nagar; K Thirunavukkarasu, 34, of Makkinampatti; M Sathish, 33, and T Vasanthakumar, 30, of Suleeswaranpatti; R Mani, alias Manivannan, 32, of Achipatti; P Babu, 33, of Mahalingapuram; T Haronimus Paul alias Haron, 32, of Achipatti; K Arulanantham, 39, of Vadugapalayam; and M Arunkumar, 33, of Panikkampatti - to the Salem central prison.While seven convicts had their faces covered with handkerchiefs and masks, two others did not make any effort to hide their faces.Anticipating trouble, the Coimbatore city police placed barricades near the court to prevent onlookers and media from entering the court hall.The All-India Democratic Women's Association (AIDWA) welcomed the verdict, with its state treasurer A Radhika saying: ""The then ruling party and police were attempting to close the Pollachi rape case in 2019. But the AIDWA held protests across the state against police and the then ruling AIADMK. Based on our protests, the accused were arrested. We welcome the judgment, and it would give hope to women who are fighting against sexual assault on women. ""The AIDWA members distributed sweets to those present inside the combined court complex. V Surendra Mohan, special public prosecutor representing CBI, said all of the nine accused were sentenced to life imprisonment until death by the court, which directed the govt to provide ₹85 lakh compensation to the survivors.""CBI and the prosecution's efforts didn't go waste, and the court gave proper justice to the victims. We welcome the judgment,"" said Surendra Mohan.Defence counsel A Pandiarajan said there were no direct witnesses for the alleged offence.""We will appeal against the verdict in Madras high court,"" said Pandiarajan.The CBI invoked sections 120 (B), 342, 354, 354 (B), 366, 376 (D), and 376 (2) (n) of the IPC against all the nine accused.","Coimbatore mahila court judge R Nandhini Devi, concurring with the CBI prosecutor's submissions, read out the verdict convicting all the nine and sentencing a few of them to double life imprisonment.
