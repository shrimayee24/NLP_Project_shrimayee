Land of poets and storytellers gets ready to turn over a new leaf,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/land-of-poets-and-storytellers-gets-ready-to-turn-over-a-new-leaf/articleshow/113439854.cms,"ANANTNAG: Often celebrated as the ""Land of Poets"", the air in Dooru seems thick with the echoes of classical Persian and Kashmiri verses. Among the poets and storytellers, Saadat Hasan Manto had roots in this pretty town cradled by the towering Pir Panjal range in south Kashmir's Anantnag district.Dooru is currently drawing attention not for its rich literary history, but for politics, as J&K gears up for its first assembly polls in a decade.Among the ten candidates vying for Dooru assembly constituency is AICC general secretary Ghulam Ahmad Mir , the nominee of National Conference-Congress alliance.Mir, a two-time legislator, faces competition from PDP 's Mohammad Ashraf Malik and Independents backed by the banned Jamaat-e-Islami and Baramulla MP Engineer Rashid's Awami Ittehad Party . The entry of former separatists as Independents might shake things up for Mir, who is also a former J&K Congress president and minister.The significance of the battle for Dooru can be gauged by the fact that Congress MP Rahul Gandhi kicked off his party's J&K election campaign here with a rally, while party president Mallikarjun Kharge announced five guarantees for the Union Territory if the alliance is elected to office.Mir has focused his campaign on local issues, saying: ""We had approved a cable car project here, but the PDP-BJP govt shifted it to Pahalgam.""NC and Congress have historically dominated the constituency, winning six of the seven assembly elections since 1977. Mir won in 2002 and 2008, while the seat went to PDP in 2014 when Syed Farooq Ahmad Andrabi, brother of party founder Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, defeated Mir.In the 2023 delimitation process, Dooru saw an additional 40,000 voters added, bringing the total to 116,749. This expanded electorate could play a vital role in determining the poll outcome.In this summer's LS polls, NC's Mian Altaf secured victory in the Anantnag-Rajouri constituency, which includes Dooru assembly segment. Altaf defeated PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti, gaining nearly 30,000 votes compared to Mufti's 9,802 from Dooru.Political analysts are optimistic, saying the NC-Congress combine stands a good chance in absence of prominent rivals. However, it remains to be seen whether the NC vote base will shift to Mir.The constituency votes in first phase.

NC

and PDP

SRINAGAR/JAMMU: The mood was sombre but the air was thick with anticipation as authorities shifted to high gear to ensure trouble-free voting and a high turnout during Wednesday’s first phase of the three-part assembly elections in J&K — the first in a decade.Loudspeakers have been switched off and campaign vehicles, having logged hundreds of miles, were garaged during the 48-hour silent period that began Monday.On Tuesday, the only signs of polls were party flags, posters, and security personnel stationed at sensitive locations across J&K’s 24 constituencies — 16 in south Kashmir and eight in Jammu division spread over seven districts on either side of the Pir Panjal range.These elections are expected to set the stage for a political showdown as established politicians, new faces, and rebel candidates vie for influence in J&K’s 90-member assembly. More than 23 lakh voters are eligible to vote in this phase, where 219 candidates, including 90 independents, are in the fray.In Kulgam, CPM ’s Mohammad Yousuf Tarigami is seeking a fifth consecutive term, while AICC general secretary Ghulam Ahmad Mir is eyeing a third term from Dooru. PDP has fielded Iltija Mufti, daughter of party chief Mehbooba Mufti, from Srigufwara-Bijbehara, making her the third generation from her family to contest there.Sakina Itoo of NC is contesting for another term from Damhal Hajipora, while PDP’s Waheed Para, Sartaj Madni, and Abdul Rehman Veeri are key candidates in Pulwama, Devsar, and Shangus-Anantnag, respectively.In Jammu, political veterans are making their bid, including NC’s Sajjad Kitchloo, Khalid Najid Suharwardy, Congress’s Vikar Rasool Wani, and Abdul Majid Wani of Democratic Progressive Azad Party (DPAP). BJP ’s Sunil Sharma and Shakti Raj Parihar are also in the fray, along with independent candidate Ghulam Mohammad Saroori, a three-time MLA who was denied a DPAP ticket after he quit Congress in support of Ghulam Nabi Azad two years ago.Other prominent candidates include former MLA Daleep Singh Parihar (BJP), Firdous Tak, Imtiyaz Shan (PDP), NC’s Pooja Thakur, BJP’s Shagun Parihar, and Mehraj Din Malik of AAP. Shagun’s candidacy is particularly poignant as her father and uncle were killed by terrorists in 2018.Allies NC and Congress are contesting against each other in Banihal, Bhaderwah, and Doda under what they term a “friendly contest”. Rebel NC candidate Pyare Lal Sharma is running as an independent in Inderwal, while BJP rebels Rakesh Goswami and Suraj Singh Parihar are contesting in Ramban and Padder-Nagseni, respectively.The elections in south Kashmir are expected to witness close contests between NC and PDP in several constituencies, although independent candidates could disrupt traditional vote banks. PDP’s Para, who is facing charges in a terrorism case, is locked in a tough battle in Pulwama with Mohammad Khalil Bandh, a former party colleague now running on an NC ticket. The contest is further intensified by the entry of Talat Majid Alie, a former member of the banned Jamaat-e-Islami. CPM’s Tarigami also faces a similar challenger in Sayar Ahmad Reshi in Kulgam.A total of 14,000 polling staff will oversee the process at 3,276 polling stations, ensuring smooth conduct of the polls.“Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) personnel are deployed in the districts to maintain security and order during the polling,” an election official said. Authorities have expressed optimism about an excellent turnout, particularly due to efforts such as special polling booths for women, people with disabilities, and nomadic tribe folks. Arrangements were also made for home voting. “We saw remarkable participation, with specially-abled and senior citizens casting their votes,” said the official.These will be the first assembly elections in J&K since the abrogation of Article 370 in Aug 2019. The previous elections were held in 2014, when the House strength was 87, including four seats from Ladakh. BJP and PDP won 25 seats each in Jammu and Kashmir valley, respectively. NC secured 12 of Kashmir’s 46 seats, while Congress took four. In Jammu’s 37 seats, Congress finished second to BJP with five seats, while NC and PDP won three each. Following the 2023 delimitation exercise, the assembly now has 90 seats, with 47 representatives from Kashmir valley and 43 from Jammu.Voting for 26 seats will be held in the second phase on Sept 25, followed by 40 seats in the final round on Oct 1.

They want equal opportunity with security. If it is a 12-hour shift, let it be for all resident doctors irrespective of their gender.

In the 2007 judgment, SC ruled that ""instead of prohibiting women employment in the bars altogether the state should focus on factoring in ways through which unequal consequences of sex differences can be eliminated"".""It is the state's duty to ensure circumstances of safety which inspire confidence in women to discharge the duty freely in accordance with the requirements of the profession they choose to follow,"" SC had ruled.Deprecating the Delhi govt's opposition to employment of women in bars citing the Jessica Lal murder case, SC had had allowed men and women below the age of 25 to take up jobs in bars, saying these youngsters graduate in hotel management courses at the age of 22 or 23 years and cannot be prohibited from taking employment in the relevant industry.",West Bengal health department issued a circular 10 days after a woman doctor's rape-murder.

Surname controversy

NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Tuesday announced Delhi minister Atishi the successor of incumbent CM Arvind Kejriwal , who on Sunday declared that he would step down from the post within two days.While addressing a Sunday's rally CM Kejriwal, out on bail in an alleged liquor policy scam , announced that he would seek a ""certificate of honesty"" from the Delhi voters and that till then he would not be the CM of the national capital.After Kejriwal's announcement, speculations on the name of his possible successor floated Delhi's political spectrum for two days, with Aitish being the front-runner for the CM post.According to reports, Atishi's name was also proposed at the Political Affairs Committee (PAC) meeting held at Arvind Kejriwal's residence last night. Her name was proposed, and a consensus was agreed upon by party members.Atishi, one of the close political confidants of Kejriwal, held several important portfolios in government while the party's top leaders, including Manish Sisodia and Arvind Kejriwal, were in jail in the excise scam case.Atishi's responsibilities include finance, planning, PWD, water, power, education, higher education, services and publicity. Since the party's formation, she has made substantial contributions to its expansion and progress.Atishi, born on June 8, 1981, was raised in an academic household in Delhi. Her parents, Vijay Singh and Tripta Wahi, both hold positions as professors at Delhi University.Atishi did her undergraduation from Delhi University's St. Stephen's College. She then received a Chevening scholarship, which allowed her to further her studies at the University of Oxford. There, she completed her master's programme. Later, as a Rhodes scholar, Atishi attended Magdalen College in Oxford in 2005.In AAP since 2012, Marlena has played a key role in the party and government since the chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal, appointed her advisor to deputy CM Manish Sisodia, primarily for education.Party functionaries highlight that her importance was evident when Kejriwal, while in jail, proposed that Atishi would hoist the national flag on his behalf at the Delhi government's Independence Day function.However, lieutenant governor V K Saxena nominated Minister Kailash Gahlot for the task instead. As the MLA representing Kalkaji assembly constituency, Atishi has been at the forefront of the party's communication efforts and has taken the lead in addressing crucial issues such as the Delhi water dispute with neighbouring states.She has been vocal on day-to-day party affairs and in taking on BJP and LG.Since the party's formation, Atishi has made substantial contributions to its expansion and progress, playing a critical role as a key member of the manifesto drafting committee for the 2013 assembly elections and formulating the party's objectives and vision.In 2018, Atishi, who was AAP's candidate for the East Delhi Lok Sabha seat, dropped her 'Marlena' surname from her Twitter handle and also from all publicity material after a whisper campaign, allegedly by the BJP, that she is a Christian.She said that she wanted to ""stop the BJP from polarizing the election"".Her Twitter (now X) handle, @AtishiMarlena, has been changed to @AtishiAAP.The official website of the party now reflects the change.Atishi, a Punjabi Rajput, was given the title ""Marlena"" by her parents as a tribute to communist icons Marx and Lenin.Rebutting the BJP’s charge that AAP was engaging in caste politics to gain an advantage in elections, the party asserted that dropping Marlena was Atishi’s own decision.","Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Tuesday announced Delhi minister Atishi the successor of incumbent CM Arvind Kejriwal.
