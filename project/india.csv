Bihar poll results: Congress targets EC for 'questionable' election process,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-poll-results-congress-targets-ec-for-questionable-election-process/articleshow/125355827.cms,"‘Not Just Congress’: Tharoor Calls Out RJD Amid NDA’s Big Bihar Lead

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Rahul Gandhi dialled RJD neta Tejashwi Yadav for his feedback on Bihar results as the opposition alliance members ""expressed collective disbelief"" over the Patna landslide in favour of the BJP-JDU combine and targeted the Election Commission alleging questionable election processes. The party ordered an internal inquiry to analyse the election data and said it will soon present the evidence of irregularities.A day after the debacle, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul met to discuss the verdict on Saturday. Also present were AICC general secretary K C Venugopal, party treasurer Ajay Maken, and state incharge Krishna Allavaru.Sources said Rahul telephoned Tejashwi Yadav from the meeting for his views on the results, and the RJD functionary expressed shock over the outcome. A similar discussion was also held with CPI (ML) chief Dipankar Bhattacharya.After the huddle, Venugopal told reporters, ""The result from Bihar is unbelievable not only for Congress, but also for the people and our alliance partners. Because a 90%-plus strike rate for a party has not happened in Indian history. We are doing a thorough analysis and collecting the data. Within a week or two, we will come out with concrete proof.""He alleged the EC was totally one-sided and there was no transparency at all, and therefore, the process was questionable.According to sources, the party found JDU voteshare rose from 32.83% in 2020 to 46.20% in the seats it contested, and that of BJP went up from 42.56% to 48.44%, while RJD's share dipped by a fraction from 32.95% in 2020, and that of Congress rose by a couple of points.It was felt that the high scores did not tally with the atmosphere on the ground.It was advocated that additions in the voters' list had to be scrutinised more carefully than the deletions because there is no individual to protest questionable additions while dubious deletions can attract individual complaints. Tejashwi is said to have expressed disbelief that only five votes were polled in a booth (in his constituency). It was also alleged that the commission's final voter number did not tally with the polled and the counting numbers.","Congress MP Rahul Gandhi dialled RJD neta Tejashwi Yadav for his feedback on Bihar results.

Police have also issued a notice to the university seeking certain documents, sources said.Meanwhile, the special cell, which is probing a deeper conspiracy behind Monday's car bomb blast near Red Fort, carried out raids and searches on premises linked to the university and doctors from there, besides six locations in Nuh. Six people, including two doctors and a cleric, have been detained.One of the doctors, picked up from Ahmadbas village in Haryana's Mewat district, was asked if alleged bomber Dr Umar Un Nabi had met him before the blast. Umar's location, while he was on his way from Ferozepur Jhirka to Delhi, came near this village, an officer said.The other doctor belongs to Pathankot and had worked at the university in 2020-21. ""The doctor was in telephonic communication with staff posted at Al-Falah University. It is being examined whether he was in touch with Umar,"" said an officer.The university-cum-hospital, located at Dhauj in Haryana's Faridabad district, has been at the centre of the blast investigation following the arrest of its doctors.Umer worked at its hospital. The investigation has revealed that room no. 13 in building no. 17 of the university was used as a key hideout where the blast plan was hatched and explosive materials were gathered, said sources.The two FIRs, the crime branch said, were registered following complaints and actions initiated by University Grants Commission and National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC).

NEW DELHI: The BJP on Saturday accused the Congress of insulting the people's mandate and looking for excuses to hide its failure, even as the opposition party charged the Election Commission with partisanship following its massive loss in the Bihar election.The attack from the party came on a day the Congress continued to be in the crosshairs of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. While speaking at a programme organised by natives of Bihar in Surat, Modi said that as Congress is unable to explain the reasons for the defeat to its allies or to its members, its top netas have chosen the easy way out by blaming EVMs, SIR and EC. ""They have found a way to make excuses. This excuse may keep them afloat for a while, but their cadre will not accept them for long,"" the PM said.BJP's chief spokesperson and Rajya Sabha MP Anil Baluni said Congress brass is incapable of introspection despite suffering repeated poll losses and credited the people's trust in the governing alliance's policies and programmes for its big win. Citing excuses to explain away its failures was a tradition in Congress, he said.BJP also played up the rumblings within the opposition camp to mock Congress for blaming the Election Commission.While BJP general secretary Tarun Chugh slammed the party for defaming the country's democratic process and its institutions like EC, its IT department head Amit Malviya highlighted dissenting voices within the opposition alliance to say that the knives are out in Mahagathbandhan after its latest drubbing.Malviya said, ""And now, senior Congress leader Shakeel Ahmad has accused Krishna Allavaru, Rahul Gandhi's pointsman in Bihar, of disrespecting senior leaders and selling Congress tickets for cash... Mahagathbandhan was never about principles - it was an opportunistic stitch-up held together by corruption and self-interest."" He added, ""The people of Bihar saw through it. They chose stability, development and integrity by voting decisively for the NDA.

Bihar polls: Congress workers in tears as state chief Rajesh Ram loses Kutumba – video,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-polls-congress-workers-in-tears-as-state-chief-rajesh-ram-loses-kutumba-video/articleshow/125351110.cms,"NEW DELHI: Congress workers in Bihar were seen in tears on Saturday as they met the party’s state president, Rajesh Ram, who suffered a heavy defeat in Kutumba. Video from the Congress office showed distraught cadres consoling Ram, who lost the seat to HAMS candidate Lalan Ram by more than 21,000 votes.In Kutumba, the final count told the story plainly. Lalan Ram secured 84,727 votes, defeating Rajesh Ram, who managed 63,202. The Congress state president’s defeat became emblematic of a wider collapse for the party across the state, where it won only six of the 61 seats it contested, its second-worst performance in Bihar since 2010. The mood inside the party quickly turned grim, with senior leaders rushing into emergency meetings in Delhi to understand what went wrong.While the Congress and its allies blamed the outcome on what they called a compromised election process, including the hurried Special Intensive Revision of electoral rolls, critics dismissed their concerns. K C Venugopal said the result was “unbelievable” and claimed the Election Commission had acted in a “one-sided” and non-transparent manner. The party alleged “vote chori on a gigantic scale,” an accusation echoed by the Shiv Sena (UBT), which called the election a “scam”.The BJP and its partners, meanwhile, celebrated the sweeping mandate. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the opposition was blaming EVMs and the Election Commission because they could not explain their defeat to their own workers. NDA leaders argued that the mandate was an endorsement of governance and the SIR, saying fake voters had finally been removed from the rolls.","Congress workers in Bihar were seen in tears on Saturday as they met the party’s state president, Rajesh Ram.

"Delhi blast: Doctor-cop unmasks terror web of moulvi, medics, modules",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-blast-doctor-cop-unmasks-terror-web-of-moulvi-medics-modules/articleshow/125282746.cms,"Poster To plot: Srinagar SSP cracks Jaish network Of radicalised doctors

Slow Traffic, Then Sudden Fireball: CCTV Captures The Delhi Red Fort Blast That Killed At Least 10

SRINAGAR: It took a doctor-cop to catch a “white-collar” terrorist network of doctors. When Jaish-e-Mohammed posters appeared overnight on Oct 19 across Nowgam-Bunpora in Srinagar, warning security forces of “dire consequences”, most residents brushed it off as a ghost from Kashmir’s violent past. For Srinagar SSP Dr GV Sundeep Chakravarthy, the signs were too deliberate — and too dangerous — to ignore.By dawn, he had ordered a case under UAPA, Explosive Substances Act, and Arms Act at Nowgam police station. CCTV footage combed frame by frame revealed three men. They were detained. Interrogation led to one name — Moulvi Irfan Ahmad of Shopian, who had led prayers at Nowgam mosque since 2020.Police teams moved fast. Ahmad’s Shopian home was searched. Another residence in Nowgam was examined. Digital footprints traced from his communications pointed to operatives beyond J&K — connections stretching into Haryana and UP.A team was dispatched. In coordinated follow-up action, police took custody of Muzammil Ahmad Ganaie, a doctor from Pulwama working in a Faridabad medical college and allegedly linked to the Jaish network. What had begun as an inquiry into wall posters turned into the exposure of a sophisticated cross-state, “white-collar” module.Three Nowgam residents were also held.A senior officer called the effort “a thorough forward-and-backward investigation that mapped every link in the chain”. “It was a good investigative effort that led to the arrest of doctors based in UP and Haryana. During questioning, more links were identified, which led to seizures, including IED-making material,” the officer said.For Chakravarthy, the 2014-batch IPS officer, this was another chapter in a career defined by frontline counterterror operations. Born in Kallur in Andhra Pradesh’s Kurnool, son of retired govt medical officer Dr GV Rama Gopal Rao and health department official PC Rangamma, he studied medicine at Kurnool Medical College and graduated in 2010. He served there briefly as a doctor before trading the stethoscope for the service revolver.On Aug 14, he received his sixth President’s Police Medal for Gallantry for his role in multiple antiterrorism operations in J&K. He took charge as SSP Srinagar on Apr 21 this year. The poster probe now stands as one of his most intricate investigations — one that allegedly peeled back layers of radicalisation and revealed an unlikely alliance of a moulvi, medics, and modules.","Jaish-e-Mohammed posters appeared overnight on Oct 19 across Nowgam-Bunpora in Srinagar.

PATNA: As the confetti settles and the echoes of victory chants fade from the bustling streets of Bihar, the NDA stands tall with a resounding mandate in the assembly polls.CM Nitish Kumar 's phoenix-like resurgence, bolstered by PM Narendra Modi's star power and a meticulously calibrated caste arithmetic, crushed the INDIA bloc's hopes.Amid the high-profile celebrations, it's the shadowy figures-the backroom boys-who orchestrated this electoral victory. These are the poll wizards, data crunchers, and whisperers in the corridors of power whose quiet machinations turned talks of anti-incumbency into loud approval.The victory was not accidental for NDA and other parties. Rather, it was a masterclass in strategy, executed by a cadre of unsung heroes who preferred spreadsheets over speeches and war rooms. At the helm of this operation was Anmol Sovit, who served as the social media head for BJP Bihar.He broke down the strategy, day-to-day operations, and the massive ground-level execution that helped the party dominate the narrative and mobilise its core voter base.""A three-phase narrative unfolded: First recalling govt achievements, then contrasting BJP's progress with opposition failures-tailored to every assembly constituency-and finally attacking rivals' flaws.Every night at 9pm, we planned the next day's narrative, briefing leaders, and preparing reactive counters,"" Sovit told TOI, explaining that social media content flowed instantly to 5.2 million people through 10,000 Shakti Kendras and 50,000 WhatsApp groups.A dedicated force of 3,027 volunteers and the Modi Mitra citizen network amplified the message. Sovit's precision digital war room delivered BJP's story with speed and scale, securing victory booth by booth.Danish Rizwan, advisor to Union minister Jitan Ram Manjhi (HAM-S), said the team analysed the data of cellphone holders in the Magadh region and broadcast WhatsApp messages to everyone.""We used to take their feedback, along with those who are living outside, who are worker class people, we addressed them tola-wise. We coordinated with the migrant workers and called them here and kept them with us. Apart from this, we did youth-centric digital campaign, organised musical bands in every tola to deliver our manifestos,"" he said.","The victory was not accidental for NDA and other parties.
