NEW DELHI: Centre on Sunday said it has initiated the exercise to conduct the census and an announcement in this regard is expected soon while indicating it had an ""open mind"" on adding a caste column in the decennial enumeration, which has been delayed since Covid outbreak.""Work on holding the census is already on and a decision in this regard is likely soon,"" a senior govt functionary said on the condition of anonymity.Several opposition parties and BJP allies have been demanding a caste count and RSS has said it had no problem with the exercise so long as the findings were used for welfare schemes, and not for ""politics"".The functionary asserted that one nation-one election , a key govt priority, will be implemented during the current Modi govt's tenure.Modalities of holding elections to state assemblies and Lok Sabha simultaneously were being worked out, a senior govt functionary said, adding, ""Definitely, one nation-one election will be implemented in this tenure itself. It will be a reality.""In his Independence Day address last month, PM Modi had made a strong pitch for one nation-one election, contending that frequent polls were creating hurdles in the country's progress.The functionary, who didn't wish to be named, also said groundwork for holding the census has begun - it is the first time that govt has confirmed the likelihood of census being conducted shortly, as well as the possibility of including caste in the exercise. ""This (caste count) is yet to be decided,"" the functionary said.The last census with a caste column in it was conducted in 1931, with govt doing away with the exercise after independence. The first phase of this decade's census was expected to begin on April 1, 2020 but had to be postponed due to Covid-19.

The functionary said govt is confident that its legislative agenda will be successfully passed and it was naive to say govt was soft and that there was pressure from allies, citing tough decisions like waqf board reforms, which have been initiated to bring transparency, which was a ""blow to the politics of appeasement"".Meanwhile, this census exercise will be the first digital one giving citizens the opportunity to self-enumerate.

"Andhra suspends 3 IPS officers for 'framing', arresting Mumbai actress",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/andhra-suspends-3-ips-officers-for-framing-arresting-mumbai-actress/articleshow/113374067.cms,"IANS photo

VIJAYAWADA: Andhra Pradesh govt suspended Sunday three senior IPS officers on charges of framing, arresting and harassing a Mumbai-based actress earlier this year in an alleged attempt to coerce her withdraw a sexual assault complaint in her home city. This is possibly the first time so many senior IPS officers have been suspended in the state in one go for alleged misuse of power and dereliction of duty.The action against PSR Anjaneyulu, Kanthi Rana Tata and Vishal Gunni was taken following an inquiry report which outlined significant lapses and misuse of power by them.SV Rajashekara Babu, commissioner of police in NTR district, submitted the inquiry report to DGP Dwaraka Tirumala Rao . Anjaneyulu is former intelligence chief, Tata former NTR district police chief and Gunni former NTR district rural DCP.Two other officers, former ACP Hanumanth Rao and former Ibrahimpatnam circle inspector Satyanarayana, were suspended earlier in the case.The actress lodged a formal complaint Friday. In her complaint, she accused the three IPS officers of conspiring with Kukkala Vidyasagar , a local businessman and YSRCP leader, to register a false case against her. The actress, along with her elderly parents, was arrested from Mumbai on Feb 2 and released on bail after 42 days in jail.According to her complaint, the false case was part of a larger conspiracy to force the actress into withdrawing the sexual assault complaint she had filed against an individual in Mumbai. Vidyasagar allegedly forged documents and produced false witnesses to frame the actress.The actress also claimed that during her detention, the cops denied her and her parents legal rights, refused access to relatives or lawyers, and subjected them to severe physical and mental harassment. She claimed the officers threatened her with more false cases in other states. ""This has taken a devastating toll on our mental and physical health. We were left suffering from anxiety, depression and panic attacks,"" the actress stated in her complaint.","Andhra Pradesh govt suspended Sunday three senior IPS officers on charges of framing, arresting and harassing a Mumbai-based actress.

Kejriwal: If CMs are arrested, I urge them to run govt from jail

NEW DELHI: Less than two days after he was released from jail on bail in the excise policy case, with conditions imposed on his functioning as chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal took everyone by surprise when he announced he would be resigning soon and sought early elections in the capital.Declaring that he will not sit in the CM's chair unless people gave him a ""certificate of honesty"", Kejriwal told his party workers at the AAP headquarters on Sunday he would quit after two days with someone else from the party taking over as CM after a meeting of the legislative party.He ruled out former deputy CM Manish Sisodia succeeding him. He was accompanied by his wife, Sunita.The entire cabinet will have to resign with him. The new leader of the legislative party will stake claim to form govt and pick a new council of ministers who will take oath of office. Majority will then have to be proved on the floor of the House.Kejriwal said he would become CM and Manish Sisodia his deputy ""only when people say we are honest"". Delhi elections are due in Feb (2025) but I demand that the elections be held in Nov along with Maharashtra...I will sit in the CM's chair only after people give me a certificate of honesty. I want to go through the 'agni pariksha' (trial by fire) after coming out of jail,"" he said, referring to Sita undergoing the test after Lord Ram and she returned from exile.Experts, however, claimed that Kejriwal cannot call for early elections without first recommending dissolution of the assembly.If that happens, it will be the prerogative of Election Commission to take a call on whether the elections could be held early. The assembly polls are due to be held in Feb 2025.Alleging that BJP had tried to prove he was corrupt, Kejriwal claimed the saffron party could not provide good schools and free electricity to people because they were corrupt. ""We are honest,"" he asserted. ""They slap false cases against non-BJP chief ministers. If the CMs are arrested, I urge them not to resign but to run their govt from jail,"" he said.""I didn't resign (after arrest in the excise policy case) because I respect democracy and Constitution is supreme for me,"" he said. Referring to his decision to quit as CM in 2014 over Jan Lokpal Bill, just 49 days after assuming power, the CM said, ""I resigned then for my ideals. I do not have lust for power.""Pointing out that the excise policy case will drag on for a long time, the CM said he will tell the people of Delhi to vote in his favour only if they considered him honest. ""For me, BJP is not important, people are important,"" he said.""Our leaders Satyendar Jain and Amanatullah Khan are still in jail. I hope they come out soon,"" he said as he thanked god ""who was with us through difficulties"". About his time in jail, Kejriwal referred to letters written by freedom fighter Bhagat Singh while in British captivity and said, ""I wrote only one letter to the lieutenant governor from Tihar and was issued a warning.""""Our freedom fighters were allowed meetings with colleagues but my party colleague, Sandeep Pathak, was not allowed to meet me in jail,"" he said.Kejriwal said some people were saying that Supreme Court had imposed some conditions and that they won't be able to do any work. ""In the past 10 years, these people have left no stone unturned in imposing conditions. The LG imposed various conditions and the central govt snatched my power by imposing one law after another, but I did not let your work suffer. These conditions do not create any obstacle for us,"" he said.Sources in the party said the CM would leave his official residence on Flag Staff Road which was at the centre of a controversy with BJP accusing Kejriwal of spending excessively on its construction. That virtually rules out his wife, Sunita Kejriwal, succeeding him.BJP and Congress, however, said Kejriwal had resigned out of compulsion and was trying to take the moral high ground. Leader of the opposition in Delhi Assembly Vijender Gupta said that with restrictions imposed on his functioning by Supreme Court, Kejriwal will neither be able to attend office, nor sign any files. His resignation will allow him to focus on campaigning for the upcoming Haryana elections with the party looking to expand its footprint with the Delhi elections after that early next year.Sources said there were several schemes and policies, such as Mahila Samman Nidhi Yojana - which promises Rs 1,000 as financial grant to women aged above 18 years -- dearness allowance for daily wagers and new electric vehicle policy, among others that AAP govt would like to roll out. And the party is apprehensive that the LG would question Kejriwal calling important meetings and accessing official documents which may lead to a stalemate in governance.",Arvind Kejriwal says he will quit as Delhi chief minister after two days.

NEW DELHI: Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Priyanka Chaturvedi on Sunday took a jab at the BJP over Union minister Nitin Gadkari 's recent claim that an opposition leader had offered to support him for the Prime Minister's post ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections , stating that the senior BJP leader was ""using the excuse of opposition parties"" to send a ""message to Modiji"" .""Nitin Gadkari ji is expressing his heartfelt desire to be on the top chair, using the excuse of opposition parties he is sending a message to Modiji.INDIA alliance has very capable leaders who can lead the country, wouldn’t want to borrow one from BJP.

He added, ""But, I asked why you should support me, and why should I take your support. To become the Prime Minister is not the aim in my life. I am loyal to my conviction and my organisation, and I am not going to compromise for any post because my conviction is foremost for me.""In his speech, the minister underlined the importance of ethics in both journalism and politics.Recalling a meeting with a senior CPI functionary, Gadkari said he told the communist leader that late A B Bardhan was among the tallest politicians from Nagpur and Vidarbha.When the leader expressed surprise saying Bardhan was an opponent of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), Gadkari said honest opposition should be respected.""I said one should respect a person who opposes with honesty, because there is honesty in his opposition...one who opposes with dishonesty deserves no respect,"" the BJP leader said.In political circles, Gadkari is seen as a popular face in the BJP who could be in the race for the top post.His name was frequently discussed as a potential prime ministerial candidate ahead of the 2014 and 2019 general elections.

Strategic move or big risk?



Will elections be held early?



'Why not resign today', asks BJP; AAP replies

A PR stunt, a gimmick: BJP and Congress attack Kejriwal



NEW DELHI: In a shock move, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday declared that he will step down from his position within the next two days, sparking speculation that assembly elections in the national capital might have be held earlier than February 2025, when the current term of the Delhi Legislative Assembly is set to end. There is also the burning question of who the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) will choose as placeholder CM till the elections.""I am going to resign from the CM position after two days. I will not sit on the CM's chair. In a few months, elections will be held in Delhi, and I want to make an appeal to the people. If you think Kejriwal is honest, then vote for me,"" Kejriwal told party workers, days after the Supreme Court granted him bail in the excise policy case.""If you think Kejriwal is guilty, then don't vote for me. Your every vote will be a certificate of my honesty. If you vote for me and declare that Kejriwal is honest, then only after the elections will I sit on the CM's chair. Until then, I will not sit on the CM's chair. I want to give 'agnipariksha' after coming out of jail,"" he added. Delhi elections are due in February but I demand that elections in the national capital be held in November with Maharashtra,"" he said.Kejriwal further indicated that his deputy Manish Sisodia will also return to office only after the people give a verdict in his favour. ""I will become chief minister and Manish Sisodia deputy CM only when people say we are honest,"" said the CM.Sisodia later confirmed on X that he will ""also go to the court of the people along with Kejriwal and only when the people will approve my honesty in the elections, I will sit on the chair of Deputy Chief Minister-Education Minister.""Referring to when he quit the chief minister's post in 2014 over the Jan Lokpal Bill, just 49 days after assuming power, Kejriwal said, ""I resigned then for my ideals. I do not have a lust for power.""Commenting on why he didn't resign after he was arrested in March, Kejriwal said: ""I didn't resign (after arrest in excise policy case) because I respect democracy and the Constitution is supreme for me.""Kejriwal framed his recent announcement as a moral stand, suggesting that he will not occupy the CM chair until he receives a ""certificate of honesty"" from the electorate.Election experts said the move is likely aimed at addressing growing concerns about corruption and governance under Kejriwal's leadership and also serves to rally the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and its supporters around a narrative of integrity and accountability.AAP Goa head Amit Palekar said in a post on X: ""Hats off sir @ArvindKejriwal for your decision to step down as Chief Minister, placing your political future in the hands of the public, is a powerful demonstration of your commitment to honest politics. Your call for the people of Delhi to decide your fate through their votes, rather than clinging to power, highlights your integrity and transparency.""Kejriwal's resignation will however mean that the party will have to choose a placeholder CM, and probably also a deputy CM, till the time elections are held.Choosing a CM for just a few months has often led to a power tussle and big exits later, as was witnessed in Jharkhand recently between JMM's Hemant Soren and Champai Soren, and in Bihar in 2014 after JD(U) chief Nitish Kumar reclaimed the top seat from Jitan Ram Manjhi.Currently, the term of the Delhi Legislative Assembly is set to end in February 2025.However, the EC has the authority to call for early elections if it deems it necessary due to extraordinary circumstances.Kejriwal's call for elections in November 2024 aligns with the electoral calendar of other states, such as Maharashtra and Jharkhand, which could provide a strategic advantage for AAP if they can capitalise on a broader anti-establishment sentiment.However, the EC has historically preferred to adhere to established electoral timelines unless there is a compelling reason to intervene. The poll panel usually assesses the stability of governance.The AAP currently commands a majority in the legislative assembly, occupying a whopping 62 of the 70 seats.While Kejriwal's resignation may create a political vacuum, it does not automatically trigger immediate or even preponed elections.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been vocal in its criticism of Kejriwal, labeling his resignation a ""PR stunt"" aimed at salvaging his image amid corruption allegations. It also questioned the timeframe of the resignation.The BJP has a well-established political infrastructure in Delhi, and if elections are held, it could potentially benefit from a divided electorate, especially if AAP's internal dynamics lead to a weakened campaign.""This 48-hour time which he (Arvind Kejriwal) has sought is enshrined in mystery ... Why are you (Arvind Kejriwal) talking about resigning after coming out and what is the matter after 48 hours? The people of the country and Delhi want to know what is the secret of 48 hours, what all is to be settled in 48 hours?"" BJP MP Sudhanshu Trivedi said at a press conference.""It is ridiculous for a CM who is having overwhelming majority in the Assembly. If he is having an iota of truth in his intentions and in what he is saying, then he should call the meeting of the Cabinet, resign as CM and recommend the dissolution of the Assembly,"" he added.Reacting to the BJP's allegations, AAP leader Atishi said there was a very simple reason behind the 48-hour time-frame. ""Today is Sunday and it is Eid on Monday, so the next working day will be Tuesday,"" she said at a press conference.Meanwhile, BJP spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari claimed that Kejriwal wants to apply the ""Sonia Gandhi model, where she made Manmohan Singh a dummy Prime Minister and ran the government from behind the scenes"".""This is a PR stunt of Arvind Kejriwal. He has understood that his image among the people of Delhi is not of an honest leader but of a corrupt leader, today Aam Aadmi Party is known across the country as a corrupt party. Under his PR stunt, he wants to restore his image...It is clear that he wants to apply the Sonia Gandhi model, where she made Manmohan Singh a dummy Prime Minister and ran the government from behind the scenes. They have understood today that the Aam Aadmi Party is losing the Delhi elections and the people of Delhi cannot vote in their name, so they want to make someone else a scapegoat,"" Bhandari said.BJP leader Harish Khurana asked the Delhi Chief Minister why he did not resign when he was in jail for the past 6 months.""If he wants to resign, then why not today? This is a drama that he will ask the people. The people are asking you if the court has given a verdict that you can't go to the Secretariat, you cannot sign a file, then what is your justification to be in the CM position?... You are a CM on bail. You are not acquitted, you are a CM who is on trial... You didn't resign when all work in Delhi stopped and you were in jail for 6 months,"" Khurana said.BJP leader Manjinder Singh Sirsa alleged that Kejriwal is not sacrificing anything and is forced to resign due to the Supreme Court's order. Sirsa further claimed that Kejriwal had asked for two days to convince all MLAs to make his wife the Chief Minister of Delhi.""Arvind Kejriwal has announced that he will resign after two days and become the CM again when he gets a verdict from the people... This is not a sacrifice, the Supreme Court has said in the order that he cannot go near the CM's chair and cannot sign any files. Hence, you don't have an option, you are forced to resign because of the SC order. The people gave their verdict 3 months ago when you asked 'jail or bail', you lost all 7 (Lok Sabha seats in Delhi) and were sent to jail... Now he has asked for a two-day time because he is convincing all MLAs to make his wife the CM... He is forced to leave his chair because he is involved in the liquor scam,"" Sirsa said.Congress leader Sandeep Dikshit reacted to the Delhi CM 's resignation and dubbed it a ""gimmick,"" adding that this had happened for the first time when an elected leader came out of jail on bail and was asked by the SC to not go to the CMO or sign any papers.""There is no question of becoming the CM again. We have been saying this for a long time that he should resign as the CM... This is a mere gimmick. This happened for the first time when an elected leader came out of jail on bail, and was asked by the SC to not go to the CMO or sign any papers... Such conditions were never imposed on any other CM... Maybe even the SC fears that this person might try to tamper with the evidence... The SC is treating him like a criminal... There is no correlation of morality and Arvind Kejriwal,"" Dikshit told ANI.",Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal says he will step down from his position within the next two days.
