TMC's clean sweep in West Bengal

NDA in Bihar & BJP in Uttarakhand lose polls

BJP wins Madhya Pradesh

Big win for AAP in Punjab

DMK retains Vikravandi seat

NEW DELHI: In a landslide victory in the assembly bypolls, the opposition INDIA bloc on Saturday bagged 10 out of 13 seats that went to polling across seven states. BJP , which after the 2024 Lok Sabha election managed to retain power at the Centre with the help of its NDA allies, faced a major setback in the polls as it could pull off only two seats.The bypolls were held in West Bengal Punjab , Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Tamil Nadu.Besides West Bengal, Himachal Pradesh, Tamil and Punjab, where the INDIA bloc is in power -- the opposition alliance also won seats in Uttarakhand, which is a BJP-ruled state.However, Himachal Pradesh's Hamirpur seat was won by BJP's Ashish Sharma.After the party's victory in Himachal & Uttarakhand, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said outcome reflected that people are standing with the oppostion alliance for ""the betterment of their lives and protection of the Constitution"".""The results of the by-elections in 7 states have made it clear that the web of 'fear and confusion' woven by the BJP has been broken,"" Rahul Gandhi wrote in a post on X.""Every class including farmers, youth, labourers, businessmen and employed people want to completely destroy dictatorship and establish the rule of justice. The public is now completely standing with INDIA for the betterment of their lives and protection of the Constitution. Jai Hindustan, Jai(Constitution),"" he further wrote.Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge said the bypoll victory shows that the""people have now completely rejected the arrogance, misgovernance and negative politics of the BJP"".Taking a cue from the bypolls results and linking it to the 2014 transition of power, Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said BJP will continue to lose upcoming polls.""This is a trend which began with the Lok Sabha elections and is moving forward. BJP will continue losing all the upcoming elections,"" Khera told news agency ANI.""This trend began for us in 2014 after which we lost many elections and now BJP will go through the same phase,"" he addedByelections in Himachal were necessitated after three former Independent MLAs - Hoshyar Singh from Dehra in Kangra, Ashish Sharma from Hamirpur and KL Thakur from Nalagarh in Solan - had resigned in March this year and joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). BJP gave tickets to all three former Independent MLAs.The Congress had fielded Kamlesh Thakur, the wife of chief minister Sukhvinder Singh, against BJP's Hoshyar Singh in Dehra, Pushpinder Verma against BJP's Ashish Sharma in Hamirpur and Hardeep Singh Bawa against BJP's KL Thakur in Nalagarh.In a litmus test for the former three Independent MLAs, who CM Sukhu repeatedly accused of being part of a BJP conspiracy to topple his government, two of them lost the polls as only Ashish Sharma managed to win from the Hamipur assembly seat.After facing a rude shock due to an unexpected slip in its Lok Sabha tally in West Bengal, from 18 seats in 2019 to 12 in 2024, BJP on Saturday was again routed in the bypolls as ruling TMC won all the four seats that went to polls.Trinamool Congress (TMC) candidates Krishna Kalyani, Madhuparna Thakur, Mukut Mani Adhikari and Supti Pandey won Raiganj, Bagda, Ranaghat Dakshin and Maniktala seats respectively.With the massive victory, the ruling TMC in West Bengal won the Matua community-majority Bagda and Ranaghat Dakshin after a gap of eight years.The BJP secured Ranaghat Dakshin, Bagda, and Raiganj segments in the 2021 assembly election. However, despite the win, the MLAs switched to the TMC.The three seats fell vacant after MLAs Kalyani, Adhikari, and Biswajit Das of Bagda resigned from their posts to contest Lok Sabha polls on TMC tickets. Kalyani, who lost to BJP's Kartik Chandra Paul in the Lok Sabha polls, was re-nominated from Raiganj in the bypolls.The Maniktala seat was won by the TMC in 2021 but became vacant after former state minister Sadhan Pandey died in February 2022.BJP, which is in power in Uttarakhand and Bihar, lost bypolls in the states. In Uttarakhand, the saffron party ceded both the seats that went to poll, while in Bihar an Independent won the election.Congress's Lakhpat Singh Butola won the Badrinath assembly by-election on Saturday, defeating his nearest rival former minister and MLA BJP's Rajendra Singh Bhandari by 5,224 votes. Another Congress candidate Qazi Mohammad Nizamuddin won the Manglaur seat.In Bihar, where BJP & Nitish Kumar's JD(U) are in alliance, Independent candidate Shankar Singh won the Rupauli assembly seats, defeating JD(U) candidate Kaladhar Prasad Mandal by over 5,000 votes.Other than Himachal's Hamirpur, the only seat BJP managed to win was Madhya Pradesh's Amarwara assembly seat. BJP's Kamlesh Shah defeated Congress's Dhiren Shah Inavati by over 3,252 votes.AAP candidate Mohinder Bhagat triumphed in the Jalandhar West by-election, securing whopping 58 per cent of the votes. Bhagat's victory marked a significant setback for Congress, which fell to third place behind the BJP.The ruling DMK emerged victorious in the bypoll to the Vikravandi Assembly constituency by a margin of 67,757 votes and NDA constituent Pattali Makkal Katchi ended up runner-up with 56,296 votes.DMK's Anniyur Siva alias A Sivashanmugam was in the lead position all through the vote-counting exercise and the margin between him and his nearest rival, PMK nominee C Anbumani widened round after round.","Opposition alliance bagged 10 out of 13 seats that went to polling across seven states.

But within a month, Congress came back to win Badrinath (Lakhpat Singh Butola) and Manglaur (Qazi Nizamuddin) in Uttarakhand, and cornered two of the three seats in Himachal.The significance of the victories is attested to by the fact that Congress suffered a big defeat in the 2022 Uttarakhand polls despite a groundswell in its favour, allowing BJP to buck the state's ""revolving door politics"". Since then, Congress failed to win anything there. Crucially, Badrinath poll was necessitated by the defection of Congress MLA Rajendra Bhandari to BJP during the LS polls.The HP wins are even sweeter for the Sukhvinder Sukhu-led Congress, which survived a major jolt after six MLAs cross-voted to defeat the party's RS candidate Abhishek Singhvi in Feb, raising questions about the survival of the state govt. Congress managed to win four of the six assembly bypolls held along with LS polls. The three bypolls on Saturday resulted from the decision of independents to join BJP. The resilience shown by Congress in Himachal is sure to hurt BJP which sensed that bypoll victories could pave the way for another attempt at the Sukhu govt.In all, Congress is enthused by the fact that it has won on weaker turfs, coupled with the realisation that voters finally appear to be reacting to day-to-day realities instead of being taken in by the rhetoric and personality politics of BJP under Modi. Congress has also won a major bragging point with the victory in the temple town of Badrinath, after SP's win in Ayodhya (Faizabad) in the LS contest. Observers said voters are chafing at the massive redevelopment project undertaken in Badrinath, which has left locals worried about their livelihoods because of demolition and displacement. Bhandari's ""anti-Brahmin rant"" is also said to have alienated BJP's core voters.","After defying doomsday predictions in LS polls, Congress Saturday notched major victories in the assembly bypolls in hill states of Himachal and Uttarakhand.

Madhuparna defeated BJP’s Binay Kumar Biswas by 33,455 votes, while 66-year-old Supti outdid her husband and former minister Sadhan Pandey of BJP by 62,312 votes.Krishna Kalyani defeated BJP’s Manas Kumar Ghosh by 50,007 votes in Raiganj — giving TMC its first win in the constituency. Mukut Nami Adhikari defeated BJP’s Manoj Kumar Biswas by 39,048 votes in Ranaghat South, which TMC had last won 13 years ago. Both Kalyani and Adhikari had joined TMC after their 2021 assembly wins, but had lost 2024 Lok Sabha polls as Trinamool candidates.In Himachal, Congress candidate and CM Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu’s wife Kamlesh Thakur defeated BJP’s Hoshiyar Singh by 9,399 votes in Dehra. Kamlesh polled 32,737 votes (57.94%), while Singh got 23,338 votes (41.3%). Congress’s Hardeep Singh Bawa won Nalagarh against BJP’s KL Thakur by 25,618 votes. BJP won the Hamirpur seat by a narrow margin of 1,571 votes with Ashish Sharma polling 27,041 votes against Congress’s Pushpinder Verma’s 25,470 votes.Wednesday’s bypolls were necessitated after three former independent MLAs — Hoshiyar Singh, Ashish Sharma, and KL Thakur — resigned in March and joined BJP.With these two victories, Congress has increased its tally from 38 to 40 in the 68-seat Vidhan Sabha, while BJP’s total seats have risen from 27 to 28. Before the Feb rebellion, when six of its MLAs left to join BJP, Congress held 40 seats. On June 4, by winning four of the six seats in the bypolls, Congress had bolstered its position from 34 to 38 seats.In Uttarakhand, after suffering a crushing defeat in the LS polls, where it lost all five seats to BJP, Congress made a strong comeback by winning two assembly bypolls, with its candidates Lakhapat Singh Butola and Qazi Mohammad Nizamuddin taking the Badrinath and Manglaur seats, respectively. Butola won by 5,095 votes, defeating Rajendra Singh Bhandari, who had switched from Congress to BJP just before LS polls. Nizamuddin’s victory was by a slender margin of 422 votes over BJP’s Kartar Singh Bhadana.In Madhya Pradesh, BJP’s Kamlesh Pratap Shah won the Amarwara seat by 3,027 votes against Congress’s Dheeran Sah Invati. Congress led until the 17th round, but BJP clawed back in the 20th and 21st rounds. BJP was elated as it succeeded in dismantling another stronghold of Congress stalwart Kamal Nath. In both the 2018 and 2023 assembly elections, Congress won all seven assembly segments in Chhindwara, which the former CM represented in LS for nine terms. For the first time in 44 years, BJP defeated Congress in Chhindwara in an LS election, with Vivek Bunty Sahu defeating Kamal Nath’s son Nakul by over 1.1 lakh votes this year.DMK retained the Vikravandi assembly constituency in Tamil Nadu, with candidate Anniyur Siva winning by a margin of 67,169 votes. Siva secured 1.23 lakh votes against PMK’s C Anbumani, who polled 56,026 votes. The bypolls, held after the death of DMK MLA N Pugazhenthi, saw 82.48% voter turnout. CM MK Stalin attributed the win to overcoming “slanderous campaigns and lies” from BJP-led alliance over the govt’s handling of illicit arrack sales, which claimed 66 lives in Kallakurichi recently.In Punjab, AAP’s Mohinder Bhagat won the Jalandhar West seat by defeating BJP’s Sheetal Angural by 37,325 votes. The seat fell vacant after Angural resigned as the AAP legislator and joined BJP in March along with AAP MP Sushil Rinku. Bhagat was with BJP before he switched to AAP during LS bypolls of 2023. His father Chunni Lal was a BJP minister and had won the constituency thrice, including when it was Jalandhar South, before delimitation.Independent candidate Shankar Singh won Bihar’s Rupauli seat, defeating JD(U) nominee Kaladhar Mandal by 8,246 votes and pushing RJD nominee Bima Bharti to third place. The bypolls were necessitated after Bharti, the incumbent JD(U) MLA, switched to RJD to contest the Purnia LS seat, where she lost to independent candidate Pappu Yadav.","Trinamool Congress (TMC) won all four seats in Bengal, wresting three from BJP and retaining one, taking its tally to 222 in the 294-seat Bengal assembly.

AHMEDABAD: Irritated by the reappearance in a Surat jail of officially destroyed liquor bottles , Gujarat high court has questioned the purpose of liquor prohibition in the state when police are involved in illegal activities.""It appears that the destruction of seized goods was nothing but an eyewash. Let a departmental inquiry be conducted into the destruction,"" HC said and ordered a report within three weeks.The court stayed until the next hearing on August 8 any action against three constables - Pinesh Vithani, Lok Rakshak Gulab Karsanbhai, and Gram Rakshak Dal jawan Dhavalbha Kiritbhai - booked on the charge of hiding the bottles in the sub-jail.During a raid in Oct 2021, police recovered 3,221 IMFL bottles in the sub-jail. They found that 1,678 bottles belonged to a stock of 124,300 that had supposedly been destroyed in Aug 2021 following a court order. A police complaint said that because the seized property room at Kamrej police station was too small for the large number of seized goods, they were being kept in a room at the police quarters. The three constables were named as accused.Vithani moved HC to quash the FIR, claiming he was made a scapegoat for being a low-ranking official. He claimed the goods allegedly recovered from the sub-jail, for which he was implicated, were in fact goods supposedly destroyed under orders of a magistrate, and a panchnama dated Aug 27, 2021 had been drawn up bearing the signature of a police inspector and other authorities. He cited the make, batch numbers, and quantity of the seized liquor, which was supposedly destroyed under a court order.","Gujarat high court questions purpose of liquor prohibition in the state.
