"Allies backing,waqf bill tabled, sent to JPC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/allies-backingwaqf-bill-tabled-sent-to-jpc/articleshow/112386638.cms,"Bill addresses complaints that waqf boards could arbitrarily declare any property theirs

NEW DELHI: The Waqf (Amendment) Bill, which aims to drastically change the Waqf Act and has attracted resistance from opposition parties and Muslim bodies , was referred to a joint parliamentary committee on Thursday for scrutiny after govt cleared its first stress test in Lok Sabha by getting the support of ‘secular’ constituents of NDA — TDP and JD(U).Soon after tabling the bill in Lok Sabha, it was Kiren Rijiju, minority affairs minister, who proposed to send the bill for further parliamentary scrutiny despite the majority arrayed in favour of the legislation , which seeks to introduce oversight on the powers of Waqf Boards, which in the current scheme of things can declare any property to be a Waqf asset.Govt offering to get the legislation examined by a parliamentary panel , which would comprise members of the two Houses belonging to major political parties, is seen as reflecting the recognition of the sensitive nature of the Bill, which has been dubbed “communal” by Muslim bodies and politicians, and appears to be aimed at warding off controversies sparked by contentious legislations; for instance, the one brought for farm sector reforms.Rijiju’s announcement also came as a surprise because the support for the legislation from BJP’s ‘secular’ allies TDP and JD(U), which are wary of appearing to be insensitive to Muslim causes, guaranteed passage of the law which has done away with the provision requiring CEOs and members of Waqf Boards to be Muslims. Instead, it has brought in district magistrates as an oversight on the crucial decision on whether a particular property is to be declared a Waqf asset.The bill also makes cases related to Waqf properties subject to the ‘statute of limitations’, thus addressing the complaint that the boards could arbitrarily declare any property, no matter how old, as belonging to waqf.Defending govt amid protests from opposition, TDP’s G M Harish Balyogi said his party believes that registration of property as proposed in this Bill would help poor Muslims & women by bringing transparency. “Purpose of donors needs to be protected. But when the purpose and power get misused, it becomes responsibility of govt to bring in reforms and introduce transparency,” he said.JD-U’s Rajiv Ranjan Singh ‘Lalan’, animal husbandry and panchayati raj minister, dismissed opposition’s charges as an attempt to mislead people and said the legislation aimed to bring transparency in the functioning of Waqf Boards. Referring to a comparison drawn by Congress with the Ayodhya and Guruvayur temple boards, the JD(U) functionary said the analogy was incorrect as the Waqf Bill sought to regulate the functioning of an organisation and not interfere with the administration of a mosque. Singh also questioned Congress’s secular credentials by reminding it about its role in the Sikh riots.The stand of the two allies, TDP (16 MPs) and JD-U (12), which together add 28 MPs to BJP’s 240 along with seven of Shiv Sena and five of LJP, among others, should guarantee passage of the Bill in LS once it has been examined by the joint parliamentary committee. Govt is comfortably placed in RS, too. While Shrikant Shinde of Shiv Sena spoke strongly in favour of the Bill, the Uddhav Thackeray faction was conspicuous by its silence.","Waqf (Amendment) Bill, which aims to drastically change the Waqf Act, has attracted resistance from opposition parties and Muslim bodies.

Govt set to have Rajya Sabha numbers for waqf bill in Nov-Dec sitting,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-set-to-have-rajya-sabha-numbers-for-waqf-bill-in-nov-dec-sitting/articleshow/112385049.cms,"Prominent Muslim bodies urge govt to withdraw bill

NEW DELHI: Govt may not face difficulty in getting the Waqf (Amendment) Bill passed in Rajya Sabha when it comes up for consideration in the next Parliament session in Nov-Dec as NDA is expected to have adequate numbers in the Upper House by then.In addition to the alliance ’s wins in elections to 12 Rajya Sabha seats on Sept 3, govt will also have the advantage of nominated members if it gets the four vacant seats filled before the next session.The four nominated member seats fell vacant last month.Four more nominated members on board means govt may not need the support of BJP-friendly parties such as AIADMK (four members) to reach the majority mark in the Upper House.The NDA tally, along with six existing nominated members and two independents, is expected to reach 117 after the upcoming polls — just two short of the majority mark of 119 in the House of 237, factoring in eight vacancies including four each from Jammu & Kashmir and the nominated category.If govt fills the four nominated seats, the House strength will be 241 and the majority mark will be 121. Since nominated members invariably go with govt, NDA’s strength will increase from 117 to 121 — the exact majority mark. BJP has 87 members in the Upper House. This number will increase to 94 with party candidates expected to win in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Odisha, Tripura, Assam, Maharashtra and Bihar. Its allies may win in Bihar and Maharashtra.The Sept 3 polls will also work for Congress as the party will get one seat in Telangana, taking its tally to 27 — two more than what it needs to retain the leader of opposition post in Rajya Sabha. With 26 members now, leader of opposition Mallikarjun Kharge’s fate hangs by a thread.Ten of the 12 seats going to polls on Sept 3 fell vacant as sitting BJP, Congress and RJD members from seven states were elected to Lok Sabha while one member each from Telangana and Odisha resigned and switched over to other parties.In Telangana, Bharat Rashtra Samithi member K Keshava Rao resigned and joined Congress while BJD member from Odisha Mamata Mohanta quit and joined BJP.Prominent Muslim organisations have demanded that govt withdraw the proposed amendments to the waqf bill and engage in a detailed consultation with all stakeholders, including religious leaders and waqf management bodies.The presidents of both factions of Jamiat Ulama -i- Hind put out strong statements opposing the amendments. Maulana Mahmood Madani, president of one of the JUH factions expressed his fears saying that the amendments are “detrimental to the protection of waqf properties”.Jamaat-e-Islami Hind (JIH) president Syed Sadatullah Husaini too registered his opposition to the proposed amendments alleging that they are “aimed at diminishing the autonomy and integrity of waqf properties and the communities they serve.”",Govt may not face difficulty in getting the Waqf (Amendment) Bill passed in Rajya Sabha when it comes up for consideration in the next Parliament session in Nov-Dec.

Waqf bill bats for deprived Muslims: Govt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/waqf-bill-bats-for-deprived-muslims-govt/articleshow/112385297.cms,"NEW DELHI: Lashing out at the opposition for criticising the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, Union minority affairs minister Kiren Rijiju on Thursday said the Waqf management was captured by some strong Muslim communities at the cost of minor groups like Bohras, Pasmandas, Ahmedias and Aghakhanis, and changes to the law would provide justice to them as well as to Muslim women and children.The bill’s introduction in Lok Sabha was met with vociferous criticism from the opposition which termed it an attempt by BJP to create a polarising issue against Muslims with an eye on the coming Maharashtra and Haryana elections.The Mussalman Waqf (Repeal) Bill, 2024, related to the Waqf bill for scrapping of the old Act, was also introduced.Rijiju said the Waqf (Amendment) Bill did not seek to interfere in the religious affairs of Muslims nor was it anti-Muslim as alleged by the opposition.He said it was futuristic in its intent to rid the law of archaic provisions and for bringing the ‘statute of limitations’ into force, which would bar any person from being able to lay ancestral claim dating back 500 years to a property and getting it declared Waqf asset.Congress’s K C Venugopal and Gaurav Gogoi, SP’s Akhilesh Yadav and Mohibullah Nadwi, DMK’s Kanimozhi, RSP’s N K Premachandran, AIMIM’s Asaduddin Owaisi, NCP’s Supriya Sule, Trinamool’s Sudip Bandyopadhyay and Kalyan Banerjee and Mian Altaf of NC among others said the bill violated Articles 25-26 of the Constitution and was BJP’s attempt to interfere in the religious affairs of Muslims, besides being outside the legislative competence of the govt and Parliament.They also warned that it would not withstand judicial scrutiny.Rijiju gave a point-wise rebuttal to their arguments, stating that important changes suggested in the bill were as per the suggestions of Sachar Committee that was constituted and accepted by the former Congress govt.Venugopal said the bill was unconstitutional and should not be allowed.Allowing non-Muslims to be members of Waqf Boards was an attack on the Muslim religion and their faith, he said, adding that it was designed keeping in mind the forthcoming elections in Maharashtra and Haryana.“This House doesn’t have the competence to amend this Act,” Asaduddin Owaisi said, adding that Waqf properties were not public properties.Bandyopadhyay and Kanimozhi, too, called it violative of Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution. While Bandyopadhyay reminded the chair that land being a state subject, the bill was “unconstitutional, divisive and against federalism”, Kanimozhi said the bill was against Muslims and minorities.Premachandran said the Waqf (Amendment) Bill was intended to disempower Waqf Boards as it would be for the collector or the govt to certify whether a property was a Waqf property or not. “They are removing Section 104. Then, removing Section 40 means that there is no need for Waqf Boards. Waqf Boards become totally powerless. It means that they are dismantling the system,” the RSP functionary added.",The bill’s introduction in Lok Sabha was met with vociferous criticism from the opposition.
