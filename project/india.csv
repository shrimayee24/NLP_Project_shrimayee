NEW DELHI: Delhi high court judge Yashwant Varma has strongly denied allegations that a large sum of burnt currency was recovered from his official residence after a recent fire incident.In a lengthy letter to Delhi high court's chief justice, Devendra Kumar Upadhyaya, Justice Varma called the claims ""baseless"" and ""preposterous"", asserting that neither he nor his family had any connection to the alleged cash.""I state unequivocally that no cash was ever placed in that storeroom either by me or any of my family members and strongly denounce the suggestion that the alleged cash belonged to us,"" he wrote. ""The very idea or suggestion that this cash was kept or stored by us is totally preposterous.""Questioning the credibility of the allegations, he added, ""The suggestion that one would store cash in an open, freely accessible and commonly used storeroom near the staff quarters or in an outhouse verges on the incredible and incredulous.""Justice Varma said the accusations had severely damaged his reputation. ""In the life of a judge, nothing matters more than reputation and character. That has been severely tarnished and irreparably damaged,"" he stated.He dismissed any suggestion that he removed or handled currency at the site, saying, ""I categorically reject any suggestion that we removed currency from the storeroom. We were neither shown nor given any sacks of burnt currency. The limited debris recovered during the incident was confined to a particular section of the residence, and there was no evidence of any currency.""Drawing attention to his financial transparency, he mentioned that all his transactions were conducted through banks, UPI, and cards. He also pointed out that authorities found no cash when the site was returned to him, stating, ""When the site was handed back to us after the fire personnel and police concluded their operations, we saw no evidence of any currency.""Following the controversy, CJI Sanjiv Khanna has constituted a three-member inquiry committee to investigate the allegations.The panel includes Justice Sheel Nagu, Chief Justice of the Punjab and Haryana high court, Justice G S Sandhawalia, Chief Justice of the Himachal Pradesh high court, and Justice Anu Sivaraman of the Karnataka high court.CJI Khanna also directed that Justice Varma be relieved of judicial duties until the inquiry is completed.","Delhi high court judge Yashwant Varma has strongly denied allegations that a large sum of burnt currency was recovered from his official residence after a recent fire incident.

'Why Ghosh went to inaugurate the road?'

'Opportunists protesting for 500 rupees'

NEW DELHI: Dilip Ghosh on Friday threatened to ""choke"" a woman protester confronting the former West Bengal Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief over inauguration of a newly-constructed road in Kharagpur.The incident took place at Kharagpur's ward No. 6 where Ghosh arrived to inaugurate the concrete road. Upon his arrival, a group of women surrounded him, questioning his absence during his tenure as a Member of Parliament.""Where have you been all this time? We never saw you even for a day when you were an MP. Now, after our councillor (Trinamool's Pradip Sarkar) has built the road, you're here?"" they asked the ex-Lok Sabha member, according to news agency PTI.Ghosh, who did not remain silent, claimed that the protesters were supporters of the ruling Trinamool Congress.He responded aggressively, saying, ""I have given the money for this (road); it is not your father's money! Go and ask Pradip Sarkar about it!""The argument quickly escalated, with one of the women retorting, ""Why bring up our father? You were an MP!""To this, the politician replied, ""I will bring up your fourteen generations! Don't scream like that, I'll choke you. I have given money for this from my MPLAD fund during my tenure as a parliamentarian.""As the situation threatened to spiral out of control, the BJP leader's security personnel, along with party workers, intervened.Police from Kharagpur Town police station also arrived at the scene.However, the protests intensified as women surrounded Ghosh's car, with many seen hitting the vehicle.Eventually, Ghosh had to leave the area.Local councillor Sarkar, a former Kharagpur MLA, condemned Ghosh's actions.He said, ""He (Ghosh) is no longer an MP, so why did he go to inaugurate the road? The municipality completed the roadwork because it's a low-lying area. He went there and lost his temper, disrespecting the women by bringing up their fathers!""Sarkar added, ""I was not there, but he even insulted my father. He called the women 500-rupee workers. He should apologise. I condemn his remarks. Such language is unbecoming of a former MP.""Meanwhile, speaking to reporters, Ghosh claimed that the protest was ""politically orchestrated"" by the Trinamool Congress.""This is not a protest. These are opportunists barking for 500 rupees. Those who bark, Dilip Ghosh will bring up their fathers,"" the senior Bharatiya Janata Party leader stated, mentioning the monthly amount under Lakshmir Bhandar, the West Bengal government's financial assistance scheme for women.He further explained, ""I had worked for the construction of this stretch of road with the MPLAD fund money that was sanctioned during my tenure. I went there to inaugurate it, but at the instruction of the local councillor, a few women came to protest. When Pradip Sarkar was chairman, I was an MLA. Even now, Kharagpur municipality has stalled many of my funded projects.""","Dilip Ghosh was inaugurating a road in Kharagpur, West Bengal.

PUNE: A 38-year-old IT engineer, Madhav Tiketi , allegedly killed his 3.5-year-old son in a fit of rage, fueled by suspicions about his wife's character. The accused, who had been unemployed for two months, slit the child's throat and abandoned the body in a deserted area, police said Friday.The case came to light when the child's mother filed a missing complaint at Chandannagar police station. Cops analysed CCTV footage, which showed Madhav with his son at 2.30 pm on Thursday, but alone by 5 pm, purchasing clothes.Tracking his mobile location, cops found Madhav at a lodge in Vadgaonsheri, where he was found intoxicated. Upon regaining consciousness, he confessed to the crime, leading police to the crime scene, where the child's blood-soaked body was recovered.DCP Himmat Jadhav said Madhav's growing suspicion about his wife's character led him to doubt his son's paternity, driving him to commit the crime. ""We have arrested the father. The body of the son has been sent to Sassoon Hospital for autopsy,"" the DCP added.","IT engineer Madhav Tiketi, 38, allegedly killed his 3.5-year-old son in a fit of rage.

Therefore, it’s requested that further orders be awaited before the conflicting orders of the high courts are acted upon,” Gauba quoted Singh as saying in his order.The RO – a former Delhi high court judge – said that the election process would remain paused until the federation informs him of the steps taken in response to the court orders.“Thus, the process is paused till BFI informs of the action taken in the wake of the court orders,” Gauba wrote.Two days ago, the Delhi High Court had stayed the federation’s March 7 directive signed by Singh that “only duly-elected members of BFI’s affiliated units are authorised to represent their respective states in the elections”.The court had ruled on a petition filed by the Delhi Amateur Boxing Association (DABA), paving the way for its office-bearers Rohit Jainendra Jain and Neeraj Kant Bhatt to vote in the BFI’s annual general meeting (AGM) as Delhi boxing body’s representatives.On Thursday, another ruling by the Himachal Pradesh High Court allowed former sports minister Anurag Thakur to contest the BFI’s presidential election by staying his disqualification from the electoral college based on the March 7 circular, and directed Gauba to include the senior BJP leader’s name as one of the representatives from the Himachal boxing body to enable his candidature.It’s been learnt that the Maharashtra state boxing association has also filed a writ petition before the High Court of Judicature at Bombay, impleading the RO to stay the elections.",Boxing Federation of India ’s forthcoming elections were on Friday “paused’ by Returning Officer RK Gauba.

NEW DELHI: Boxing Federation of India’s (BFI) elections are heading towards an intriguing finish.Incumbent Ajay Singh and the opposing faction challenging his presidential candidacy are exercising every conceivable strategy to outmanoeuvre each other in this high-stakes electoral contest.After the initial triumph of having rejected former sports minister Anurag Thakur ’s bid to contest the federation’s elections following an unexpected office directive and suspending secretary general Hemanta Kalita and treasurer Digvijay Singh on allegations of corruption and favouritism, Singh-led BFI has been compelled to confront successive setbacks within a span of two days through various court orders, yielding the advantage to their opponents.On March 7, the Delhi high court had stayed the federation’s directive that only bonafide and duly-elected members of BFI’s affiliated units are authorised to represent their respective states in the forthcoming elections, scheduled for March 28 in Gurugram. The court had ruled on a petition filed by the Delhi Amateur Boxing Association (DABA), paving the way for its office bearers Rohit Jainendra Jain and Neeraj Kant Bhatt to vote in the BFI’s annual general meeting (AGM) as Delhi boxing body’s representatives.On Thursday, another ruling by the Himachal Pradesh high court allowed Thakur to contest the BFI’s presidential election by staying his disqualification from the electoral college based on the March 7 circular and directed Returning Officer – former Delhi high court judge R K Gauba – to include the senior BJP leader and four-time Lok Sabha MP’s name as one of the representatives from the Himachal boxing body to enable his candidature.A single judge bench of Justice Ajay Mohan Goel directed the BFI to extend the last date of submission of nominations so that Thakur can file his papers whilst permitting him to represent the Himachal Pradesh Boxing Association (HPBA) in the AGM and “fully participate therein”.Justice Goel ruled that the electoral college approved by the RO on March 12 and 13, which left out Thakur, “is prima facie bad and not sustainable in law”“In this backdrop, balance of convenience is also in favour of the petitioners and if interim, as prayed for by the petitioners is not granted, then irreparable loss shall be caused to them. As an ad-interim measure, this court stayed the operation of notice, dated 07.03.2025, as well as the rejection of nomination of one of the two nominated members namely, Mr. Anurag Singh Thakur. It also goes without saying that the election process will be subject to the final outcome of this writ petition or any other order that may be passed by the court in this application,” the order stated.The court ruled that prima facie, it was evident that the March 7 order by Singh was issued “without any authority and without any power”.Thakur was declared ineligible on the grounds that he wasn’t an elected member of the HPBA and can’t represent the state in the BFI’s AGM. The HPBA maintained that Thakur was an elected member of the state unit since 2008 and served “in different capacities, including chairman”.HPBA’s president Rajesh Bhandari will be another representative from the state, along with Thakur.Reacting to the development, a BFI source close to president Singh’s camp said that the next course of action will be decided after going through the 34-page order. “A lot will now depend on the RO. We have received both the court orders and the BFI’s legal team will go through them. We will certainly challenge them in the respective courts,” added the source.",Boxing Federation of India’s (BFI) elections are heading towards an intriguing finish.
