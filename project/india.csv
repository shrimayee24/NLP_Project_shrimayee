EC To Launch SIR in 12 States and UTs in Phase 2, CEC Gyanesh Kumar Says Zero Complaints in Bihar

'Making public info panel picks will lead to litigation': SC

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court brushed aside on Monday pleas for making public names of candidates shortlisted by the selection panel for the posts of chief information commissioner and information commissioners after the Centre said the process would be completed in three weeks. ""The selection panel comprising the PM, leader of the opposition and a Union Cabinet minister nominated by the PM would finalise the names in 2-3 weeks,"" additional solicitor general K M Nataraj told SC.Advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing on behalf of social activist Anjali Bhardwaj, said the Centre is brazenly violating the SC order for making public names of all who had applied, those shortlisted, and the procedure adopted.Govt has also said ""they would appoint people who had not even applied for the posts"", Bhushan claimed.Nataraj told the bench that there are many eligible and suitable candidates who do not want their names to be publicised ""fearing backlash by a section of society who find fault with everything done by govt"".Bhushan said the Centre and states are killing information commissions by keeping their sanctioned strength low and yet keeping posts vacant to frustrate RTI applicants.The bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi assured Bhushan it would scrutinise the selections to ensure that those appointed meet the eligibility criteria. But Bhushan said that citizens have the right to know who has been shortlisted. The bench said, ""Publishing the names of those shortlisted would entitle those not in the panel to move the courts against the appointment process which would then never get completed. "" SC posted the matter for further hearing after three weeks.After Bhushan pointed out that Jharkhand has not appointed anyone to the state information commission rendering it dysfunctional, the bench was assured by the state that the appointment process has already been notified and would be completed in 45 days. Supreme Court said if the process was not completed within the timeframe, then the chief secretary would be liable for appropriate orders.The court also noticed vacancies in the SICs in Maharashtra, Karnataka and MP and asked them to initiate the selection process within three weeks. It said in Tamil Nadu, Bihar, Odisha, Karnataka and Maharashtra thousands of RTI applications are pending adjudication by the SICs because of their inadequate strength. It asked these states to consider increasing the strength of SICs and apprise the court.","Supreme Court brushed aside pleas for making public names of candidates shortlisted by the selection panel for posts of chief information commissioner and information commissioners.

BIG UNSC Takedown on Kashmir: India Rebukes Pakistan Over Illegal Occupation and Rights Crackdown

SRINAGAR: For the first time since assuming office in Oct 2024, J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah on Monday admitted his optimism regarding the restoration of statehood was fading.“I was hopeful from day one about the restoration of statehood,” he said. “Now, the hope has diminished. The longer you keep us waiting and delay statehood, the less hopeful we’ll be,” Omar said while interacting with reporters in his office at J&K Assembly, which is in session currently.Asked about reports claiming he would step down as CM if J&K’s statehood was not restored within a fixed period, Omar refused to comment. On Sunday, he had said in an interview that he had set for himself a finite time frame wherein, if statehood was not restored, he would resign. Omar skirted the topic on Monday.He, however, insisted that lack of statehood was becoming a hurdle for the elected govt to function. “Am I mad to ask for statehood if there are no hurdles in executing our work? If it were easy to work in a Union Territory, then all states of the country would have asked for becoming UT and we wouldn’t even be talking about statehood,” he said.Mentioning some of the hurdles, the CM said officers were not posted according to the govt’s choice, and several departments that should have been under the control of the elected govt are not were not with it.Omar also took on the assembly speaker, Abdul Rahim Rather, who refused discussion on the arrest of AAP MLA Mehraj Malik after BJP members insisted that the case sub was judice.Dismissing allegations of a “secret understanding” with BJP, he said maintaining cordial ties with the Centre was essential “so that the work of governance continues smoothly”, but asserted that “NC has no ties with BJP, and it never will have”.He further said NC was the only party that was taking on BJP in J&K. “We were the only ones who challenged them in the Rajya Sabha election... In the Nagrota bypoll, both Congress and PDP decided not to contest. The only party standing up to the BJP there is the NC,” he said.As two of his party MPs, Aga Syed Ruhullah Mehdi and Mian Altaf Ahmed, criticised his governance style on Sunday, the CM said he respected Mian Altaf as a senior colleague and valued his advice immensely. Omar, however, said he did not want to talk about Mehdi, and that there was no comparison between the two MPs.Mehdi has been extremely critical of Omar and has accused him of abandoning advocacy for Article 370 and betraying people on many promises. The Srinagar MP hit back at the CM saying: “There are thousands of people languishing in jails and he (Omar) doesn’t know anything about it. The fight for Article 370 is a fight for our existence. We must be informed of what happened in that fight,” the MP Srinagar said.","J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah on Monday admitted his optimism regarding the restoration of statehood was fading. “The longer you keep us waiting and delay statehood, the less hopeful we’ll be,” Omar said while interacting with reporters in his office at J&K Assembly, which is in session.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124857352,imgsize-58090,width-400,resizemode-4/hope-for-statehood-of-jampk-diminishing-omar-abdullah.jpg"

'What difference did SIR make in Bihar?': Prashant Kishor



NEW DELHI: The Opposition on Monday launched a sharp attack on the Election Commission of India (ECI) after it announced Phase 2 of the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls across 12 states and Union Territories, calling it a ""vote theft"" exercise designed to benefit the ruling BJP Several leaders accused the poll body of acting under government pressure, claiming that ""in today's India, it's the government that chooses voters.""Earlier, Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar announced that the second phase of SIR will cover 51 crore voters and be held between November and February. ""The second phase will be conducted in 12 states and Union Territories. SIR will ensure no eligible elector is left out and no ineligible elector is included in poll rolls,"" Kumar said.He added that the enumeration process will begin on November 4, draft rolls will be published on December 9, and final rolls will be out by February 7, 2026.The 12 states and UTs covered under Phase 2 include Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Puducherry, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal.Kumar also clarified that Assam, which goes to polls in 2026, will have a separate SIR exercise due to distinct citizenship provisions.Reacting sharply, the Congress alleged that the ECI was working in collusion with Prime Minister Narendra Modi to manipulate voter rolls.In a post on X, the party said, ""The Election Commission is now set to play the game of 'vote theft' in 12 states. In the name of SIR, 6.9 million votes were slashed in Bihar. Now, crores of votes will be slashed across 12 states.”Calling the move a ""conspiracy against democracy,"" Congress alleged, ""This is blatant 'vote theft,' which Narendra Modi and the Election Commission are carrying out together.""""The Election Commission should have been held accountable for these cases. Instead, it has become part of the game of 'vote theft',"" it added.Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray went a step further, demanding legal action against the poll body.""A case should be registered against the Election Commissioner for the corrupt practice of bogus voters,"" Thackeray said. ""Voters elect government in a democracy, but today the government chooses voters,"" he added.Congress leader Pawan Khera echoed similar criticism, questioning the transparency of the SIR process. ""We still haven't received answers to questions related to the SIR conducted in Bihar so far. The situation was such that the Supreme Court had to step in to rectify the SIR process,"" Khera said on X.He alleged that the EC and the BJP were ""working hand in hand."" ""The intentions of the Election Commission and the BJP have been exposed to the entire country through the SIR in Bihar,"" he said.""Whenever SIR takes place, Election Commission officials visit every household, adding new voters and removing those who need to be deleted from the list. Following the revelation of 'vote theft' linked to Rahul Gandhi ji’s Aland Assembly, the SIT has reported that a centralised operation was being carried out to remove names from the voter list.""""Amid all these issues, the Election Commission’s conduct of SIR is under suspicion, and its intentions do not seem genuine. Neither the opposition nor the voters are satisfied,"" he added.Tamil Nadu Chief Minister and DMK President M.K. Stalin also hit out at the ECI for scheduling the SIR during the monsoon season. ""To carry out Special Intensive Revision just months before the election, and especially during the monsoon months of November and December, brings serious practical difficulties,"" he said.""To conduct SIR in a hasty and opaque manner is nothing but a conspiracy by the ECI to rob citizens of their rights and help the BJP. In Bihar, large numbers of women, minorities and people from SC and ST communities were removed from the electoral rolls, and the absence of transparency has fuelled serious suspicion in the public mind,"" he stated.Stalin announced that an all-party meeting will be held on November 2 in Chennai to discuss the issue and decide on the next course of action.""Following the announcement, we held discussions with our alliance partners, and on that basis an all party meeting will be convened on 2 November to decide the next course of action. The right to vote is the foundation of democracy. Tamil Nadu will fight against any attempt to murder it, and Tamil Nadu will win,"" he said.AAP Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh told PTI that the Chief Election Commissioner was ""acting as an agent of BJP and PM Modi.""""EC Chief Gyanesh Kumar is a liar, just like Narendra Modi. He is an agent of the BJP. It’s unfortunate for the country that such a person is the Chief Election Commissioner,"" he added.Jan Suraaj founder Prashant Kishor dismissed the move as politically motivated stating that, ""SIR was done in Bihar. What difference did it make? Was anyone's name struck off? A few people did face difficulties.""""BJP can try all it wants, they might want to delete someone's name, scare someone else and bother someone. But if people turn against you, do any SIR or FIR, there will be nobody to save you,"" he added.The EC earlier completed Phase 1 of the SIR in Bihar, where the final list of 7.42 crore electors was published on September 30. Polling in Bihar will take place in two phases — on November 6 and November 11 — with counting on November 14.",ECI announces Phase 2 of Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls across 12 states and Union Territories.

KOLKATA: Bengal govt has transferred 67 IAS and 460 state civil services officers in one of its largest single-day administrative reshuffles yet, moving 14 district magistrates, besides key civic and infrastructure officials.The sweeping changes come months before EC's special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls, which begins this week in Delhi and will start soon in Bengal. Under Article 324(1) of the Constitution, the SIR process vests EC with powers of ""superintendence, direction and control"" similar to those it exercises during elections. Administrative officers such as DMs and block development officers serve as electoral registration officers during this phase.Many of the transferred officers had been in their posts between two-and-a-half and four years and were close to breaching EC's rule barring officials from holding the same post for more than three years when elections are announced. Bengal's assembly polls are expected by March 2026, and EC's schedule for electoral roll verification is seen as a precursor to the election calendar.""The transfers were routine,"" a senior state officer said, but officials acknowledged that carrying out such a reshuffle after EC's process began would have been ""much more complicated and difficult"".Legal experts said once SIR starts, EC's direct oversight limits the state's power to reassign key officers.The reshuffle order, signed Friday, comes amid what insiders described as ""feelers"" from EC over the ""slow pace"" of SIR preparations in some districts. ""DMs also become district electoral registration officers once the SIR process starts and come under EC's direct purview. EC could have asked for transfer of those DMs with whose work it was not satisfied,"" a retired bureaucrat said.Officials said similar transfers in police administration could follow to comply with EC's three-year rule, though those can wait until before formal poll announcement, as police personnel do not come under EC control during the SIR phase.","Bengal govt has transferred 67 IAS and 460 state civil services officers in one of its largest single-day administrative reshuffles yet.

'Institutional Murder' Rahul Blames BJP Govt for “Shielding Criminals” in Maha Doctor’s Suicide case

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Sunday launched a sharp attack on the Maharashtra government, claiming that law and order in the state has “collapsed” following the alleged rape and suicide of a woman doctor in Satara. The grand old party also accused the state’s home department of being “bankrupt.”Congress leader Vijay Wadettiwar said, “The Home Department of Maharashtra is bankrupt. The law and order situation has completely collapsed... Ordinary people don't even have the courage to go to the police station... The police have become vagrants, resorting to hooliganism...”Deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde, meanwhile, condemned the incident and assured that the accused would face strict action. “The accused have been arrested. The incident is condemnable and unfortunate. In this case, none of the accused will be let go, there will be very harsh punishment, and the whole matter will go to the fast-track court,” Shinde said.Maharashtra minister Pankaja Gopinath Munde also met the victim’s family in Phaltan and expressed support and solidarity, assuring them of justice.Earlier, Satara Police arrested two individuals -- Police Sub-Inspector Gopal Badne and Prashant Bankar — in connection with the case.The two have been booked under charges of rape and abetment to suicide. PSI Badne, who was named in the suicide note, has been suspended, officials confirmed.Authorities said the woman doctor died by suicide on Friday, leaving behind a message written on her hand that mentioned a police officer and two others.The victim’s cousin alleged that she had been facing sustained political and police pressure related to her professional duties. “There was a lot of police and political pressure on her to make wrong mortem reports. She tried to complain about it. My sister should get justice,” the cousin told ANI.“She was under a lot of political and police pressure for the last year. Medical staff at the hospital are also involved. Everyone forced her to make wrong postmortem reports and forge fitness certificates. She was being forced to perform more and more postmortems despite other officers being present at the hospital,” the cousin added.The family suspects that another suicide note may exist, suggesting that the doctor had been documenting her complaints and distress in writing. Another relative demanded exemplary punishment, saying, “The accused should get the strictest of punishment.”The Federation of All India Medical Association (FAIMA) has condemned the death of doctor and called for an immediate and transparent investigation into the case.","Congress leader Vijay Wadettiwar said, “The Home Department of Maharashtra is bankrupt.
