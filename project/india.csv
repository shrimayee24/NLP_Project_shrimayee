Roat pushes for recognition of desert tribal areas in Raj,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/roat-pushes-for-recognition-of-desert-tribal-areas-in-raj/articleshow/113002325.cms,"MADHYA PRADESH: Rajkumar Roat , on Sunday urged the Union govt to officially designate certain regions as Desert Tribal Areas (DTA).Speaking at a public gathering of tribals in Sheo tehsil in Barmer district , Roat underscored the necessity of identifying tribal-dominated blocks and gram panchayats within these areas to secure electoral reservations for tribals.This meeting, held to commemorate the UN-designated World Tribal Day (WTD) observed on Aug 9, was also attended by Sheo MLA (Independent) Ravindra Bhati and Barmer MP (Congress) Ummeda Ram Beniwal. Prior to the meeting, the trio had a roadshow together in Sheo, travelling in the same vehicle, and received an overwhelming response.Roat, as an outsider to the region, gave a clear message to the major political parties of his ambitions beyond the contours of the tribal belt.Roat issued a stark warning to the BJP and Congress, stating that if they continue to neglect the political aspirations of tribals in the five desert districts—Barmer, Bikaner, Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, and Pali—the Bharat Adivasi Party (BAP) will rise as the primary political voice for these communities.He claimed at least 10 as-sembly seats in these districts should be reserved for STs, considering their populace.“The state govt has a responsibility to conduct a caste survey in the desert region and ensure that Scheduled Tribes (STs) receive their rightful share in jobs, educational institutions, and political representation,"" Roat asserted, accusing consecutive govts of deliberately downplaying the tribal population to suppress their influence.BAP, which has three MLAs from the Tribal Sub Plan Area in Southern Rajasthan, is eyeing this moment as an opportunity to extend its political reach into the desert region. “This is just the beginning. Get used to seeing me here often,” Roat confidently told the crowd, signalling his intention to establish a firm presence in the area.He also advocated for the creation of a separate religious code as a solution to the assimilation of STs into other castes like OBCs and SCs, and even into Christianity.In a conversation with TOI, Roat disclosed that his team is working on documenting tribal pockets in desert areas where people have acquired OBC and SC certificates, despite their original ST status. “Our first phase will focus on correcting these discrepancies to bring out the exact number of Tribals here which I bet will shock everyone,” he explained.Looking ahead, Roat outlined a multi-phase plan that includes a focus on improving education for Tribal children by tracking dropouts and pushing for the establishment of more schools in the region. ""The final phase involves launching a robust political movement before the next assembly elections. We aim to secure reserved electoral positions—Sarpanch, Gram Panchayat members, municipal and assembly seats—to ensure that Tribals have a strong voice in their own development,"" Roat concluded.A two-term MLA, Roat won from Banswara in a highly electrified contest against BJP heavyweight Mahendrajeet Singh Malviya, with support from the Congress.","Rajkumar Roat urged the Union govt to officially designate certain regions as Desert Tribal Areas (DTA) Roat issued a stark warning to the BJP and Congress, stating that if they continue to neglect the political aspirations of tribals, the Bharat Adivasi Party will rise.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113002433,imgsize-320365,width-400,resizemode-4/113002433.jpg"

Woman leader Simi Rose Bell who alleged 'casting couch' exists in Kerala Congress expelled from party,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/woman-leader-who-alleged-casting-couch-exists-in-kerala-congress-expelled-from-party-hema-committee-report/articleshow/112973191.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former Congress party and PSC member Simi Rose Bell John was expelled from the party on Sunday following her alleged derogatory remarks against women leaders of the Congress in an interview.The Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) General Secretary M Liju announced the decision, stating that Simi Rose Bell John's accusations were aimed at mentally harassing and defaming lakhs of women leaders and workers in the Congress movement, allegedly in collusion with political adversaries.Simi Rosebell had alleged that several women within the party have faced exploitative behaviour from male party leaders, similar to the ' casting couch ' in the film industry. She expressed doubts over the merit of many women leaders in the party, suggesting that their rise to prominent positions should be evaluated based on their political track record and grassroots work in KSU and Mahila Congress.The expulsion came after women leaders from various positions within the party jointly requested the KPCC leadership to take action against her.In response to the charges, Simi Rose Bell John held a news conference in Kochi, lashing out at Congress LoP VD Sathesan. She said, ""Satheesan said that women who have dignity, pride, and dignity can not work in this party. A person who struggled for the party for some time was expelled.""She also challenged the party to release evidence of the alleged conspiracy with the CPM party.KPCC President and Member of Lok Sabha K Sudhakaran earlier stated that the allegations made by Simi Rose Bell John were baseless and that the KPCC would investigate the matter following a complaint filed by the Mahila Congress against her.","Simi Rosebell had alleged that several women within the party have faced exploitative behaviour from male party leaders.

"Chhattisgarh high court upholds conviction in 24-year-old attempted rape case, orders accused to surrender",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/chhattisgarh-high-court-upholds-conviction-in-24-year-old-attempted-rape-case-orders-accused-to-surrender/articleshow/113000477.cms,"RAIPUR: Upholding the conviction of a trial court in a 24-year-old case, the Chhattisgarh high court has dismissed the appeal of the accused who attempted to rape a 6-year-old girl in his youth and ordered the accused to surrender within four weeks. A Single Bench of Justice Narendra Kumar Vyas ordered that if the accused fails to surrender within the stipulated time, the police will arrest him and send him to jail, while also informing the court.“Based on a careful review of the legal provisions, it is evident that engaging in sexual intercourse with a woman below the age of sixteen, irrespective of her consent, constitutes the offence of 'Rape'.The term 'penetration' refers to the insertion of the male organ into the female genitalia, however slight it may be. Penetration is an essential element for establishing the crime of rape. To prove penetration, there must be clear and convincing evidence that a part of the male organ was within the labia of the woman's pudendum, regardless of how little,” the Court said.The 35-year-old accused, a resident of Durg district, took a 6-year-old girl who was playing outside his house in August 2001. He took her to the bedroom, removed her clothes, and attempted to rape her. The girl came out of the house crying. When her mother asked why she was crying, the girl said that her undergarments were wet and informed her about the act committed by the accused. The mother filed a police report. After conducting the necessary medical examination and procedures, the police arrested the accused under Sections 376 and 511 of the IPC and filed a charge sheet in court.After examining the statements of the victim , witnesses, and cross-examining 9 witnesses, the Durg local court sentenced the accused to three years and six months in prison and imposed a fine of Rs 500 in 2002.The accused filed an appeal against the sentence in the high court in 2002. During the pendency of the appeal, the accused was granted bail. The final hearing on the appeal took place in the high court in August 2024. The appellant's counsel argued that the medical report did not find rape; only an attempt was made. He claimed that the case falls under Section 354 and that the accused committed the crime in his youth, is now elderly and one of his daughters is handicapped. The accused has other family liability.The distinction between attempt to rape and preparation for rape has been a subject of examination, the court said. In the case of Madan Lal vs. State of J&K, the Supreme Court clarified that the key difference lies in the degree of determination exhibited by the accused.If the accused goes beyond the stage of preparation, such as stripping the girl naked, laying her on the ground, undressing himself, and forcibly rubbing his erect penis on her private parts without successful penetration, it would be considered an attempt to commit rape under Section 376 read with Section 511 of the IPC, rather than merely an assault under Section 354 IPC, the Chhattisgarh HC said.Furthermore, the Supreme Court has held that ejaculation without penetration also constitutes an attempt to rape, as penetration is the essential element of the offense. In Koppula Venkat Rao vs. State of Andhra Pradesh, the Court emphasised that the connection necessary for the offence of rape has not been established if there is ejaculation without penetration, and the conviction should be altered from Section 376 IPC to Section 376/511 IPC.The Supreme Court, in State of Madhya Pradesh vs. Mahendra alias Golu, examined the distinction between attempt and preparation to commit an offense. The Court explained that an attempt involves a direct movement towards the commission of the offence after the preparations are complete, and it must be proven that the attempt was made with the intent to commit the offence. Even if the accused is unsuccessful in committing the principal offence, an attempt is still possible.In the present case, the evidence provided by the victim and her mother clearly establishes that the appellant took the victim to his bedroom and forcibly rubbed his erect penis on her private parts, causing swelling, but failed to penetrate her vagina, the Court said. The statements of the victim and her mother are reliable and demonstrate the appellant's actions without any possibility of tutoring, the high court said.Considering the evidence and legal position, the trial court's conviction of the appellant under Section 376 read with Section 511 of the IPC and the sentence of 3 years and 6 months is justified. The appellant has already served 10 months and 6 days in jail during the trial and appeal, which will be set off under Section 428 of the CrPC. The appellant is required to surrender within four weeks to serve the remaining part of his sentence, failing which the police authorities are directed to arrest him and submit a compliance report.","The Chhattisgarh high court has dismissed the appeal of the accused who attempted to rape a 6-year-old girl in his youth.
