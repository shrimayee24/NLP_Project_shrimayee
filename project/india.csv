Bihar elections: Is BJP using Chirag Paswan to checkmate chief minister Nitish Kumar?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-elections-is-bjp-using-chirag-paswan-to-checkmate-chief-minister-nitish-kumar/articleshow/122769101.cms,"Representative image/AI generated

""The law-and-order situation in the state has become a matter of ""grave concern"" as murders are happening daily, the morale of criminals is ""sky-high"" and the functioning of police and overall administration defies reason.""

""How many Biharis will be murdered? It is beyond understanding what is the responsibility of the Bihar Police?""

""It is a matter of worry the way crime has risen and law and order have collapsed in Bihar. If such an incident has happened in a posh locality of Patna, then we can only imagine what is happening in villages. It is worrying to see such incidents occur under a government that was known for good governance; then the opposition will have a chance to speak up. Strict action needs to be taken to set a precedent so that such a thing is not repeated.""

""Such incidents aggravate our concerns ... If the family (of Gopal Khemka) is scared, it is justified. This is a family that has faced this earlier as well. Did the local administration provide security to the family? It was the responsibility of the administration.""

NEW DELHI: Is Chirag Paswan setting the stage for Round 2 of his ""targeted"" tussle with Nitish Kumar ahead of assembly elections? In the 2020 assembly elections, Chirag played a key role in making Nitish Kumar's JD(U) the junior partner of the BJP in the ruling NDA.Five years later, as the election approaches, he is back to targeting the Bihar chief minister, this time over the deteriorating law and order situation in the backdrop of several high-profile murders in the state.Here's a look at some of the statements Chirag has made targeting his own government in the poll-bound state over law and order:Clearly, a no-holds-barred attack on the Bihar police, which functions under the direct watch of CM Nitish Kumar, as he also holds the home portfolio.The LJP chief's attack is completely justified given the recent murder incidents -- first the killing of a prominent businessman Gopal Khemka, who was shot outside his residence in Patna by a bike-borne assailant in broad daylight and then the killing of a convict in a hospital by four assailants, caught on CCTV.But the only catch is: Chirag Paswan is part of the NDA -- which includes the BJP and has ruled Bihar for most of the last 20 years.The present Nitish government has two deputy chief ministers from the BJP.So, who is Chirag targeting? The NDA government in the state, or only chief minister Nitish Kumar, with whom he shares a bitter, uneasy relationship? Well, the LJP (RV) chief is certainly not attacking the BJP, as his latest tweet on deteriorating law and order in Bihar was hours after he had held a meeting with BJP chief J P Nadda.In 2020, when Chirag had walked out of the NDA ahead of the assembly elections over seat sharing, he had kept his ties with the BJP while targeting Nitish Kumar. He had then strategically fielded candidates to divide the NDA votes and ensure the defeat of JD(U) candidates in several assembly seats.Chirag Paswan’s Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) contested 137 seats in 2020, but mostly in constituencies where Nitish Kumar’s JD(U) was fighting and not the BJP. JD(U)’s seat count fell from 71 in 2015 to 43 in 2020. The party lost 72 seats of the total 115 it contested. In 27 of these, the LJP's vote share exceeded the margin of defeat. In 64 seats where the party failed to win, LJP’s vote tally exceeded the margin of victory, effectively altering the final outcome.This time around, Chirag is a Union minister and very much a part of the NDA at the Centre, but he is still playing the guessing game. While announcing his decision to contest elections, he slammed the lack of development in the state till now and announced that he is contesting elections to improve the condition of the people of Bihar. Interestingly, this is also what the opposition parties claim.Chirag had earlier announced that he would be contesting elections on all 243 seats to ensure that the NDA wins and forms a government again. Now, here is a catch. Perhaps, Chirag, whose party has no members in the state assembly at present, is preparing the ground to ensure that his party gets a good number of seats to contest. But that may be difficult as the JD(U) considers itself a key player and is unlikely to give up its claims despite the party's poor show in 2020.So, if Chirag is not satisfied with seat sharing, he may yet again, with perhaps tacit approval of the BJP, decide to contest alone even while continuing to be a part of the NDA at the Centre. His aim possibly would be to ensure again that the BJP does not suffer electorally while Nitish bears the brunt.If that indeed happens, Nitish will be left in the lurch. Already battling negative reports around his health, Nitish, who has dominated politics in Bihar for the last 20 years, faces one of the most challenging elections. He has already sworn again and again that he will make no more flip-flops, something that gave him the dubious distinction of being called the ""Paltu Ram"".CM Nitish is likely to be wary of Chirag's plans. The Bihar chief minister knows that if his party's tally plunges further, it will be the end of the road for him, especially when it comes to leading the NDA in the state. And the mantle would naturally pass on to the BJP.","Chirag Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) contested 137 seats in 2020. The party lost 72 seats of the total 115 it contested.

"Varma moves SC for quashing of inquiry report, questions in-house procedure validity",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/varma-moves-sc-for-quashing-of-inquiry-report-questions-in-house-procedure-validity/articleshow/122772897.cms,"Justice Yashwant Varma. (File photo)

Varma questions validity of in-house procedure that allows CJI to recommend removal of judge

Cong MPs to sign motion in LS against Justice Varma

NEW DELHI: Ahead of a possible removal motion in Parliament’s monsoon session, Justice Yashwant Varma moved Supreme Court for quashing of an in-house inquiry report holding him guilty for the huge illicit cash at his official residence in Delhi and challenged the constitutionality of then CJI Sanjiv Khanna’s recommendation to the Centre to strip him of HC judgeship.Justice Varma, whose defence team is led by senior advocates including Kapil Sibal, filed the petition faulting the process adopted by the three-member panel to inquire into the cash allegedly found at his bungalow, terming the panel’s conclusions about his guilt as mere surmises without evidence.Interestingly, the day saw a PIL being filed in the SC by advocate Mathews Nedumpara seeking registration of an FIR for the unaccounted cash that was discovered within the premises of the judge’s official residence by first responders who reached after a fire on the night of March 14. Many former judges of Delhi HC shared the view of the PIL petitioner and said only a thorough investigation by a probe agency could unravel the money trail.In the writ petition filed through advocate Vaibhav Niti, Justice Varma asked why Delhi Police and Delhi Fire Service personnel, who discovered the cash, did not seize it or prepare a ‘panchnama’, which alone could have been admissible evidence. He accused then CJI Khanna of subjecting him to a media trial by uploading unsubstantiated material against him on the SC’s official website.Repatriated to Allahabad HC during the inquiry, the judge said the panel’s report was handed over to him on May 4 and the then CJI “advised him to resign or seek voluntary retirement by 7pm on May 6, failing which the CJI would ‘intimate competent authority to initiate action for his removal’”.The judge, who had been barred from judicial work, said he was denied a personal hearing he had sought, as per the in-house procedure, before the CJI and senior SC judges, prior to the CJI sending the recommendation to the President and the PM on May 8, just five days before CJI Khanna retired.He requested that SC declare the CJI’s recommendation unconstitutional and ultra vires. He also questioned the constitutional validity of the in-house procedure that empowered the CJI to recommend removal of a constitutional court judge.This in-house process “creates a parallel, extra-constitutional mechanism that derogates from the mandatory framework under Articles 124 and 218 of the Constitution, which exclusively vest powers for removal of judges of high courts in Parliament through an address supported by a special majority, following an inquiry under the Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968”, he said.Justice Varma said power to remove constitutional court judges was given to Parliament by the Constitution after conducting a thorough trial of the charges against a judge with in-built safeguards including framing of charges, cross-examination, and proof beyond reasonable doubt for ‘proven misbehaviour’.Thus, the in-house procedure, as far as it usurps parliamentary procedure to recommend removal of judges, violates the doctrine of separation of powers. Judiciary cannot assume the role reserved for the legislature in the removal of judges, Justice Varma said.He said the Constitution conferred no disciplinary or superintendence power with the CJI over HC or SC judges. Thus, the CJI cannot assume, through in-house procedure, an unregulated authority to act as the arbiter of the fate of HC and SC judges, he said.Justice Varma’s challenge mirrors the line Sibal took on his YouTube show last week to dissect the inquiry report with panellists: former SC judges Justices Madan Lokur and Sanjay Kaul and ex-Delhi HC judge Justice Mukta Gupta. In the show, Sibal argued that the in-house inquiry was not consistent with constitutional provisions.Congress MPs will sign the motion that govt will bring in Lok Sabha against Justice Yashwant Varma, with the party saying it will be done to set up a 3-member statutory panel which is required under Judges Inquiry Act before a judge’s removal. Party general secretary Jairam Ramesh said opposition will also push govt to move on the motion to remove against Allahabad HC judge Shekhar Yadav, who is accused of making “hate speech”.Ramesh slammed non-registration of an FIR against Varma, saying the entire process has been based on a report of the in-house panel of SC. He said Justice Yadav violated his oath with his speech but the notice to remove him is pending with Rajya Sabha chairman for past seven months.",Justice Yashwant Varma questions validity of in-house procedure that allows CJI to recommend removal of judge.

"In blow to Lalu, SC refuses to stay trials in land-for jobs cases",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-blow-to-lalu-sc-refuses-to-stay-trials-in-land-for-jobs-cases/articleshow/122772561.cms,"Lalu Yadav

NEW DELHI: Ahead of the Bihar assembly elections , RJD leader Lalu Prasad suffered a setback on Friday with SC declining to stay ongoing trial proceedings against him in land-for-job ‘scam’ cases, in which CBI charge-sheeted him for allegedly securing plots of land from those who got jobs in the railways during 2004-09 when he was railway minister.When senior advocate Kapil Sibal attempted to discredit the cases against Prasad, lodged in 2022 after more than a decade of the alleged ‘scam’, by terming it as political vendetta, additional solicitor general S V Raju told a bench of Justices M M Sundresh and N Kotiswar Singh that Prasad’s petition for quashing of FIRs in the cases is still pending in the Delhi HC and that the former railway minister has challenged an interim order of HC.Though Sibal maintained with vehemence that “it is the most unfortunate case” and accused CBI of starting a probe without mandatory sanction under section 17-A of the Prevention of Corruption Act, the bench said, “We will not stay the trial. However, we can direct the trial court to dispense with Prasad’s personal presence. Let HC decide the main issue.”After investigations, CBI on June 7 last year filed the third and final chargesheet before a special court in Delhi against Prasad, his wife Rabri Devi, son Tej Pratap Yadav and daughter Hema Yadav, and others. The case against Prasad and his family members is related to appointments made to Group D positions in 11 Railway Zones between 2004 and 2009.",CBI charge-sheeted him for allegedly securing plots of land from those who got jobs in the railways during 2004-09 when he was railway minister.
