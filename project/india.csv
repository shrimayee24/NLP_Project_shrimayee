Explained: What's the National Herald case and why was Rahul Gandhi questioned by ED

NEW DELHI: BJP on Sunday asked Congress to give account of “loot by its leaders” in the National Herald case instead of levelling baseless allegations against the govt after Delhi Police filed an FIR against Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi along with their six other associates and business entities in the matter on an array of criminal charges.BJP’s Ravi Shankar Prasad rejected Congress’s allegation of political vendetta and said the case predates Modi govt. “The nation should know that Young Indian in which Sonia and Rahul own 38% share each, acquired assets worth thousands of crores belonging to AJL, which was held by Congress and owned by National Herald, with only Rs 50 lakh.”“It is clearly a case of loot. The law is taking its course, and Congress should let it,” he said, underlining Congress pleas in HC and SC to get proceedings against its members quashed were rejected and the judiciary asked them to face trial. On the FIR, he said Sonia & Rahul have been slapped with charges of criminal conspiracy and cheating. ED probed the charges, reached a conclusion and now asked police to lodge an FIR.","Ravi Shankar Prasad rejects Congress’s allegation of political vendetta and said the case predates Modi govt. “It is clearly a case of loot.

‘Full Stop to Many Questions’ Chirag Paswan Hails PM Modi, Nitish as NDA Soars Past 200 Seats

NEW DELHI: Union minister and Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) president Chirag Paswan — whose party is part of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) that swept the recent Bihar assembly polls — on Sunday claimed that “several MLAs” from the opposition Mahagathbandhan are in touch with the ruling camp.Paswan made the remark while responding to questions from journalists about speculation that at least four newly elected Congress MLAs — the party won only six seats — are in touch with the Janata Dal (United), led by chief minister Nitish Kumar.“I cannot say about any specific party but many opposition MLAs are in touch with the NDA. They feel that it is only in this coalition, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi , that they can serve the people,” he said, according to news agency PTI.The Hajipur MP argued that there is “growing disenchantment” with the opposition, which he accused of doing “nothing constructive” and of ""obstructing"" the government’s functioning.“This has been noticed during every session of the Parliament. We anticipate similar behaviour in the session beginning tomorrow when, incidentally, the session of the state assembly is also going to commence,” Paswan, a former actor, remarked.The winter session of Parliament and a special five-day session of the Bihar assembly — the first since the elections — will begin on Monday. The Parliament session will conclude on December 19.However, Bihar Congress president Rajesh Ram — who himself lost in the recent polls — bristled at the LJP (RV) chief claim.“This has been a narrative that always does the rounds whenever elections are held. We heard similar things in 2020, but all our 19 MLAs remained with the party,” Ram stated.The NDA secured 202 of the assembly’s 243 seats. The BJP emerged as the single largest party with 89 seats, followed by ally JD(U) with 85. The LJP (RV) recorded its best-ever performance, winning 19 of the 28 seats it contested, with two of its MLAs inducted as ministers. Alliance partners Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) and Rashtriya Lok Morcha bagged five and four seats, respectively.In contrast, the Mahagathbandhan managed only 35 seats, of which 25 came from its biggest constituent, the Rashtriya Janata Dal.","Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) president Chirag Paswan claimed that ""several MLAs"" from the opposition Mahagathbandhan are in touch with the ruling camp.

"NC puts spotlight back on special status, counters ‘pro-BJP’ talk",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nc-puts-spotlight-back-on-special-status-counters-pro-bjp-talk/articleshow/125678765.cms,"Chief minister Omar Abdullah (File photo)

SRINAGAR: J&K chief minister’s Omar Abdullah ’s National Conference (NC) has foregrounded a recently adopted resolution for restoration of special status, seeking to blunt claims that the party has jettisoned a core issue and is cosying up to BJP.Spokesperson Imran Nabi Dar stressed the resolution, passed on Nov 28 at NC’s working committee -- its highest decision-making body --was a message to all that the party’s ideological position remains unchanged.“In the working committee meeting, party legislators stressed that we must not be seen as giving up on our political agenda of restoring the special status under Article 370 . The resolution reaffirms our commitment to special status. It reflects the dominant sentiment within the party,” Dar told TOI.The resolution states that “the working committee unanimously reaffirmed its unwavering commitment to the restoration of J&K’s special status”, adding the issue is central to aspirations and dignity of the people and must be addressed without further delay. “The party will continue its principled fight for its full restoration.”NC also urged the Centre to immediately restore full statehood to J&K, as “promised on the floor of Parliament, repeatedly affirmed in public domain, and noted by Supreme Court”.NC’s manifesto for the 2024 polls had vowed to strive for restoration of “Article 370 and statehood as prior to Aug 5, 2019” -- when the Centre abrogated the special status and turned J&K into a Union territory.On Nov 6 last year, weeks after NC was voted to office, J&K assembly passed a resolution seeking special status. Later, NC was accused by one of its own MPs, Aga Ruhullah Mehdi, and opposition PDP of giving up on Article 370 and concentrating on “restoration of statehood”.Dar said several legislators in the working committee meeting pushed for protests in Delhi to press for statehood, citing difficulties they face at the ground level in getting developmental work executed. But the leadership decided to wait at this stage. “The party expects the Centre to restore statehood as promised in Supreme Court and Parliament,” Dar said.Another NC functionary, Salman Sagar, underscored concerns about attempts to link the party with BJP and the need to counter such narratives firmly.“Central govt and BJP are two different things. As a border state, maintaining a working and cordial relationship with Centre is necessary. But that does not mean we are aligned with BJP. CM (Omar) has made it clear we will never partner with BJP. He reiterated this in the working committee meeting, too. We have decided to challenge any narrative that seeks to portray NC as BJP-friendly. We will fight this narrative war,” Sagar said.","National Conference (NC) seeks to blunt claims that the party has jettisoned a core issue and is cosying up to BJP.
