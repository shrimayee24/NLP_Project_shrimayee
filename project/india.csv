""All provisions against rape accused are available in the law, but the intent of the one who implements the law also needs to be good. This is the same Vidhan Sabha where Mamata Banerjee stood up to support Sheikh Shahjahan. She even went on to label the victims as peddlers of propaganda,"" he said.""What action was taken against those who destroyed evidence at RG Kar? Her intention is not to address issues faced by women in the state but to save herself from all the humiliation and divert the issue,"" Trivedi added.BJP's Amit Malviya said other than being a desperate attempt to divert from the raging protests, a closer look at the fineprint reveals the law seeks to limit media reporting on judicial proceedings in rape cases.","BJP claims Mamata Banerjee's intention is not to address issues faced by women but to save herself from the ""humiliation and divert"" the issue.

It is not only contemptuous but goes against all constitutional and moral principles which a state must abide by,"" MHA said.The Centre accused the Mamata Banerjee govt of wilfully adopting a non-cooperative approach to create hurdles and jeopardise the SC's suo-motu proceedings.The home ministry said two companies of CISF comprising 184 personnel, including 54 women, under the command of a woman officer, were deployed at RG Kar Hospital from Aug 22 on SC orders. As no provision was made by the state govt for their accommodation near the hospital, the personnel were staying at the CISF campus and travelled an hour to reach the hospital.Despite the ministry taking up the issue with state chief secretary for adequate transport facilities and security gadgets, there was no response from state govt, it said.""Due to non-availability of accommodation, security gadgets and paucity of transportation, duty personnel, especially women personnel, are facing a lot of difficulties in performing their duties after travelling from various locations to reach the hospital,"" it said.","West Bengal govt has adopted a ""blatant non-cooperative approach"" towards CISF.

It reverses the earlier stance of the INDIA allies that their Lok Sabha partnership would not extend to assembly polls in Haryana or Delhi.AAP sources said Congress general secretary K C Venugopal and AAP MP Raghav Chadha have discussed the nitty-gritties over two rounds, adding that AAP has sought 10 seats while Congress is willing to cede seven.According to sources, the two parties are confident of a pact, and the discussion is around the specific constituencies that AAP is seeking, which is different from the list of seats that Congress is offering. The tie-up hinges on a reconciliation on these seats.While Haryana Congress has been opposed to any alliance , sources said Rahul Gandhi nudged the party in the direction of cobbling an INDIA bloc.The third round of talks between Congress and AAP for a possible seat-sharing arrangement in the upcoming Haryana assembly elections is likely to take place on Wednesday.It is learned that Rahul asked participants in the Congress central election committee (CEC) meeting on Monday about an alliance with AAP, but there was barely a discussion on the issue.Congress general secretary Deepak Babaria made the surprise revelation on Tuesday afternoon when he told reporters that alliance talks were on. However, after the meeting of the CEC late evening, he said that ""the talks are in a primitive mode"" and their fate would be known in two-three days.Babaria said the alliance was to avoid any division of votes in favour of BJP which is battling serious anti-incumbency . Even Samajwadi Party (SP) of Akhilesh Yadav is being spoken of as an ally.The announcement came even as the CEC held back-to-back meetings for selection of candidates.The party's top panel cleared 32 candidates out of the 41 that were discussed on Tuesday, after having finalised 34 seats and sent 15 for review out of the 49 brought before it on Monday.A sub-committee will take a look at the pending seats. It is now believed that the pending seats could be among those being discussed between AAP and Congress.Speaking to reporters after the poll committee meeting, Babaria said there was still no decision on the candidature of wrestlers Vinesh Phogat and Bajrang Punia, and a final picture would emerge in two days.AAP MP Sanjay Singh welcomed the alliance negotiations and said, ""Defeating BJP and its politics of hatred and politics against people, farmers and youth is a priority for all of us.""Meanwhile, Haryana Congress functionaries Randeep Surjewala, Kumari Selja and Bhupinder Hooda will meet soon to discuss various poll-related issues.",AAP sources say Congress general secretary K C Venugopal and AAP MP Raghav Chadha have discussed the nitty-gritties over two rounds.

MCD panel polls to go ahead despite mayor's opposition,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mcd-panel-polls-to-go-ahead-despite-mayors-opposition/articleshow/113042796.cms,"NEW DELHI: MCD commissioner Ashwani Kumar , following mayor Shelly Oberoi's refusal to appoint presiding officers for the body's ward committee elections on Sept 4, cited powers in the MCD Act and a Union home ministry notification to order that the polls be held as scheduled.On Aug 30, Delhi High Court declined to provide any relief to AAP councillors who had filed a plea for extension of dates to file nominations for the ward committee polls.On the court's direction, the nominations were filed by that evening. The process of forming the ward committees and the 12 Standing Committee has been pending for over 20 months.In his order, Kumar said, ""In the larger public interest and in order to preserve the democratic spirit of the municipal body and in exercise of power conferred under section 487 of Delhi Municipal Corporation Act along with notification issued on Oct 1966 by Union home ministry, the lieutenant governor has directed that the aforesaid elections be conducted as per schedule notified by the MCD commissioner. Further, the deputy commissioners of the zones shall perform functions and duties of presiding officers in the interest of free and fair elections.""In a letter to Kumar on Tuesday, Oberoi mentioned that the election notice was issued by the commissioner on Aug 28 and was received by the municipal councillors, including her, late in the evening of the same day. The notice fixed Sept 4 as the date for the polling and Aug 30 as the deadline for filing nominations, allowing only one clear day between the issue of the notice and the nomination deadline.She said that Section 30 of the Representation of the People Act mandates a minimum of seven days for filing nominations from the date of notice. ""Although the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act is silent on this matter, the guiding provisions of the People's Representation Act shouldn't be disregarded, particularly concerning the issue of the minimum timeframe for filing nominations,"" she said.Last year, AAP had gone to the Supreme Court after the lieutenant governor appointed 10 aldermen without the consent of Delhi govt. On Aug 5 this year, the court held that LG had the right to nominate the aldermen without govt's consent. Since the aldermen have voting rights in the ward committee elections, their appointment favoured the chances for BJP winning in the ward committee polls in five out of 12 zones. The prospects of BJP increased when five AAP councillors joined the saffron party from the precariously placed wards in Narela and Central zone. Even though one councillor, Ram Chander, later returned to AAP, BJP still appears now to hold an advantage in seven zones.Reacting to the situation, Delhi BJP Spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said that by declining to appoint the presiding officers for the ward committee elections, the mayor had thwarted democracy. ""She has lost all constitutional and ethical right to stay on as mayor and has pushed MCD towards the brink of dissolution,"" he claimed.
