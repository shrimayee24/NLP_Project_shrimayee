"TMC delegation meets EC, alleges 40 death-related to SIR till now in WB",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tmc-delegation-meets-ec-alleges-40-death-related-to-sir-till-now-in-wb/articleshow/125645312.cms,"NEW DELHI: A Trinamool Congress (TMC) delegation in its meeting with Election Commission on Friday alleged that there have been 40 deaths, including those of Booth Level Officers (BLOs), related to the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls, so far, in West Bengal, and accused chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar and his two colleagues of “having blood on their hands”.TMC leader in Rajya Sabha Derek O' Brien, who led the delegation, told reporters that it raised five questions, but “did not get any answers”, even as the CEC spoke for an hour. The TMC leader said his party was not opposed to the concept of SIR, but was against the “unplanned manner” and “heartless” way in which EC was executing it.Another member of the delegation, Lok Sabha MP Mahua Moitra claimed that EC dismissed the submissions on “SIR-related deaths” as mere allegations. “Does EC or the CEC take responsibility for the deaths of BLOs?” TMC asked as it alleged that across several states, numerous BLOs have lost their lives while carrying out their SIR duties. These include cases of BLOs who have been forced to commit suicide, the Mamata Banerjee-led party alleged, citing the “inhuman pressure” by EC.TMC accused EC of anti-West Bengal bias and asked that if the true intent of SIR was to remove illegal immigrants from the voters’ list, why was Bengal the only border state under scrutiny.Why is the exercise watered down as a “special revision” in Assam and non-existent in other border states of the Northeast, and is SIR meant to “protect the voters’ list or to cast doubt on the very identity of Bengalis” and push them out of it, TMC asked. The party sought to know how many non-citizens were eradicated from the rolls in Bihar after the SIR exercises in the state.TMC also asked EC that if the electoral rolls were good enough for the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, then why have these been dubbed “unreliable”. “Why not dissolve the Lok Sabha that was elected by these ""unreliable voters,” it said.The TMC has also questioned the neutrality of the SIR process and alleged that when BJP raises a frivolous issue, it is taken up with utmost seriousness. It alleged that sacrosanct rules like the Model Code of Conduct have been tampered with in Bihar to help BJP.“In Bengal, BJP leaders are claiming that one crore voters’ names will be deleted from the rolls. EC has taken no cognizance of these comments, nor has it negated the fear mongering by BJP,” TMC alleged.Later in the evening, TMC parliamentary party leader in Lok Sabha Abhishek Banerjee alleged that EC is “deliberately planting selective leaks to falsely claim that it has provided a point-by-point rebuttal” to the issues raised by the party. “These assertions are not just misleading, they are outright lies,” he alleged."," Trinamool Congress (TMC) delegation in its meeting with Election Commission on Friday alleged that there have been 40 deaths, including those of Booth Level Officers (BLOs), related to the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India on Friday rejected the Trinamool Congress’ claim that around 40 people have died in West Bengal due to the ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls, dismissing the allegation as baseless while cautioning the party against interfering with booth officials.The Commission also directed the West Bengal DGP and the Kolkata Police Commissioner to ensure Booth Level Officers are not threatened or pressurised during enumeration, and instructed district authorities to safeguard the independence of BLOs, EROs and DEOs engaged in the process.The 10-member TMC delegation, led by Rajya Sabha MP Derek O’Brien, met the EC top brass and accused Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar of having ""blood on his hands"". EC officials said they told the MPs that while political messaging is a party’s prerogative, misinformation on election procedures cannot be permitted. ""EC also told the delegation of TMC not to influence or threaten the BLOs regarding dead, shifted and duplicate voters,"" an official said.TMC, however, disputed the Commission’s version, calling its statements ""misleading"" and ""outright lies"". National General Secretary Abhishek Banerjee accused the poll body of ""deliberately planting selective leaks"" and demanded that the EC release ""CCTV footage"" of the meeting along with ""every piece of evidence it claims to possess"".O’Brien said, ""None of this was said to us at the meeting. In the morning, we told them they have blood on their hands. Now we say they are a bag full of lies. What a shame they are bringing to this constitutional body. They should issue a press release.""O’Brien stated that the party had placed five questions before the Commission but received no answers. ""We started the meeting by stating that the CEC has blood on his hands. We raised five questions,"" he said. ""The CEC spoke uninterrupted for one hour... but we did not receive any answer to any of our five questions."" A TMC attendee claimed the CEC spent nearly half the time discussing the SIR in Bihar, saying, ""Of the one hour he spoke, he devoted half to praising the job done in Bihar. He said, 'You can apply for corrections in the next two months,' and spent the rest of the time explaining the basics.""The TMC delegation submitted a list of 40 alleged SIR-linked deaths, which the EC termed unverified. Mahua Moitra said, ""We began by presenting a list of individuals whose deaths we believe are linked to the SIR process... The CEC said that these are merely allegations."" Party leaders also questioned why the revision was not being undertaken in Northeastern states that share borders with Bangladesh and Myanmar, and asked how the electoral roll used in the last Lok Sabha polls had become ""unreliable"".They further flagged apprehensions over deletion of voter names and accused BJP leaders of claiming that one crore names would be removed. ""The ECI has taken no cognisance of these comments, nor have they negated the dear mongering by the BJP,"" a TMC leader said. A party source claimed they have recorded 60 tragedies linked to the process, including 41 civilians and 19 BLOs.The SIR exercise is underway in 12 states and Union territories, including West Bengal.

Congress netas blame excessive focus on 'vote chori' for Bihar debacle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-netas-blame-excessive-focus-on-vote-chori-for-bihar-debacle/articleshow/125626384.cms,"Congress leader Rahul Gandhi with Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav during the 'Voter Adhikar Yatra' (PTI)

'Your Future Is Being Stolen': Rahul Gandhi's Bold Message to India's Gen Z For Democratic Change

NEW DELHI: Disproportionate focus on SIR/vote chori at the cost of crucial local issues of cost of living, migration and corruption was cited by some senior functionaries as a reason for the decimation of Congress in Bihar, as they urged the central leadership to fix accountability for the defeat if the party is serious about reviving itself in the state.Some local functionaries listed three reasons for the defeat: govt's payment of Rs 10,000 to women during the polls, booth manipulations and a lack of coordination among partners. The AIMIM was also blamed for division of minority votes in Seemanchal region and beyond. It was alleged that BJP had used a ""basket of tools"" to ""fix"" the polls which spanned SIR, EVMs, the buying of votes and use of the administration against opposition candidates. Days after the Bihar debacle, the AICC brass of Mallikarjun Kharge, Rahul Gandhi and KC Venugopal held a review of the poor show with poll candidates and MPs.Around 70 members met the leadership in batches. Before the meetings started and top netas arrived, two losing candidates were reported to have clashed over the reasons for the defeat - with one taking exception to the other advocating violence against ""outsiders"" who got party tickets.Some claimed that the idea of meeting the state functionaries in batches was also to avoid a potential clash in a large gathering.A politician is said to have found fault with the manner of candidate selection which, he said, cost the party heavily. He is said to have told Rahul Gandhi that just like he had taken responsibility for the defeat in 2019 Lok Sabha polls and stepped down as party president, heads should roll in the state too - in what was a veiled jibe at AICC in-charge Krishna Allavaru - an issue that was also raised by other members, sources said. A section of party members also targeted the alliance with RJD, saying the ally brings some votes but also polarises other communities. It was also demanded that Congress break the alliance with RJD. However, at one group meeting, Rahul is said to have rebuffed it by asking why the party failed on seats that witnessed ""friendly fights"" with Congress and RJD in the fray against each other.Questions were asked about the weightage given by Congress to caste census with arguments that victory of candidates from individual upper castes is vastly higher than their population share, while that from some large OBC communities is just in line with their numbers - in a veiled reference to the advocacy of ""share as per population"" slogan.","Some local functionaries listed three reasons for the defeat: govt's payment of Rs 10,000 to women during the polls, booth manipulations and a lack of coordination among partners.
