NEW DELHI: As opposition continued to target the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath's slogan '' (will be slaughtered, if divided), Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday gave a new pitch in Maharashtra -- '' (We are safe, only if united).Accusing the Congress of pitting one caste against another, PM Modi in an election rally in Dhule asked people to stay united, saying "".”“The sole agenda of the Congress party is to make one caste fight against another. They do not want SCs, STs and OBCs to progress and get their due recognition … Remember, ‘',"" he said.PM' new slogan comes amid row over Yogi Adityanath's '' pitch. The expression was first used by the UP CM at a rally in Agra in the backdrop of Hindu minorities being subjected to violence in Bangladesh. Later, PM Modi and RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat also made similar pitches for Hindu unity later. During his annual Vijaya Dashami speech this year, Bhagwat said that ""being unorganised and weak is like inviting atrocities by the wicked"".Yogi Adityanath had also repeated the slogan during an election rally in Maharashtra while campaigning for ruling-Mahayuti.In his first campaign rally in Maharashtra for the upcoming November 20 assembly elections, PM Modi opened an all-front attack on Congress and stated that since Nehru's era, the party and his family has opposed reservation, and now their fourth generation 'yuvraj' [Rahul Gandhi] is promoting caste divisions.“Since Nehru's time Congress and his family opposed reservation and now their fourth generation ‘yuvraj' (prince) is working for caste divisions,” Modi said.He alleged that the Congress-led INDIA bloc sought to remove the Constitution from Jammu and Kashmir, whilst firmly stating that Article 370's restoration was impossible under any circumstances.The Prime Minister also accused the coalition of misleading Dalits and Adivasis by presenting blank books as the Constitution.He cautioned Congress and its allies against promoting ""Pakistan agenda"" or using separatist rhetoric, asserting that such efforts would fail as long as he had public support.""Only Ambedkar's constitution will be followed in J&K. You must have seen on TV how a resolution was moved in the Jammu and Kashmir assembly on bringing back Article 370 and when BJP MLAs protested, they were thrown out. The country and Maharashtra should understand this,"" Modi said.Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge on Tuesday accused the BJP of having some ""rotten thoughts"" for believing in ''.""The BJP has some rotten thoughts, it believes in '',"" Kharge had said while addressing an election rally in Ranchi.Meanwhile, NCP chief Ajit Pawar indirectly distanced himself from UP CM's slogan saying that people from 'outside' make such statements, but Maharashtra has always maintained communal harmony. ""Nobody should compare Maharashtra with the other states. People here have always ensured communal harmony. Some from outside come here and make statements, but Maharashtra has never accepted any communal division. The state follows the secular ideology of Shahu (Maharaj), (Jyotiba) Phule, and (Babasaheb) Ambedkar,"" he said.","PM' new slogan comes amid row over Yogi Adityanath's '' pitch.

"Sangh, through 65 friendly outfits, launches drive to mobilise Hindu votes for BJP, allies",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sangh-through-65-friendly-outfits-launches-drive-to-mobilise-hindu-votes-for-bjp-allies/articleshow/115095941.cms,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi along with party leaders and candidates during a public meeting for the Maharashtra Assembly elections, in Nashik (Pic credit: ANI)

MUMBAI: While the focus is on the daily jousting for the Maharashtra elections, there are subtle moves being made to mobilise the Hindu vote in BJP and Mahayuti's favour. In its own 'woke' moment - not of the kind seen on US campuses or in 'liberal' corridors but of the right-wing conception - the RSS has, through more than 65 friendly organisations, launched a campaign called 'Sajag Raho' ('Be Vigilant, Be Awake') in Maharashtra, which is intended not only to bolster BJP's push in the assembly polls but as a pushback against what it sees as ""a larger attempt to keep Hindus divided and further atomise them,"" with repercussions going beyond politics.'Sajag Raho' is the newest addition to the three-line national chorus by Hindutva forces after the LS polls and the recent attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh: the 'Batenge toh katenge' remark of Yogi Adityanath, PM Modi's comment of 'Ek hai toh safe hain' on Friday in Dhule (where BJP-RSS say consolidation of Muslim votes in Malegaon led to the narrow defeat of the BJP candidate in the LS polls), and Yogi's comment again in Maharashtra's Washim of 'Ek hai toh nek hain', the 'nek' there meaning, according to the Parivar, ""Hindus will stay noble and not be forced to resort to violence, if only for self-defence, if they are not divided.""Sangh sources though said 'Sajag Raho' and 'Ek hai ho safe hai' are not aimed against anyone but at eliminating caste divisions among Hindus. A senior BJP functionary said ""hundreds of meetings"" are being organised by RSS 'swayamsevaks' and 65-plus NGOs to convey the message. Though Maharashtra polls are the immediate objective, the campaign, according to Parivar sources, represents the stirrings of an ideological and intellectual response to a larger phenomenon where Hindus get splintered on caste lines while Muslims bury differences and coalesce into a solid voting bloc, fired by the objective of seeing the BJP's back.Among groups involved in the campaign are Chanakya Prathisthan, Matang Sahitya Parishad and Ranragini Sevabhavi Sanstha. All the four Sangh 'prants' or regional divisions across Maharashtra - Konkan (including Mumbai and Goa), Devgiri (Marathwada), Paschim (western) Maharashtra (which includes Nashik and parts of northern Maharashtra), and Vidarbha (where RSS has headquarters) - are involved in the campaign, organising meetings at the shakha level.One of the campaign's highlights is the citing of the Dhule Lok Sabha and Mumbai North East Lok Sabha seat outcome as examples. It refers to what the Sangh calls the 'Malegaon model', which, according to it, hurt a 'divided' Hindu community. Social worker Girish Prabhune, a Padma Shri awardee for his work with the Pardhi community who is among those holding meetings, said, ""BJP's defeat in Dhule was systematically planned. Though Congress's Shobha Bachchav won by 5,117 votes, she got a lead in just one assembly segment. BJP's Subhash Bhamre got a lead of 1,89,210 from five assembly segments. But in one segment, Malegaon Central, he got just 4,542 votes and the Congress candidate got a lead of 1,94,327 votes from there, because of which she won the seat."" Malegaon Central is a minority-dominated assembly segment.The meetings being held are with RSS-BJP sympathisers and other voters who may or may not be inclined to vote BJP. They focus on three points: Hindutva and impact of votebank politics on elections, the alleged influx of Bangladeshis and Rohingya Muslims and its implications on electoral politics, and ""the vendetta politics that will revisit not only BJP and RSS but Hindu society as a whole if minority consolidation is allowed to have its way,"" a senior RSS member said.RSS is not officially owning up to the campaign as an organisation but is simply calling it ""an initiative by swayamsevaks"". ""Swayamsevaks have taken the lead to tell Hindu society it should not be divided on basis of caste, especially at a time when the Maratha-OBC divide has deepened in the state,"" said an RSS functionary.However, a BJP functionary said the campaign has been ""ideated and executed by RSS, it is oriented towards BJP's electoral prospects in Maharashtra and beyond, and it has its own logo and steering committee.""Asked if 'Sajag Raho' represented another way of putting across the 'Batenge toh katenge' message, Devendra Pai, assistant professor of political science at University of Delhi and formerly a key member of RSS think tank Rambhau Mhalgi Prabodhini, said Maharashtra and Mumbai in particular had an audience for both slogans. ""Both will find resonance, maybe in different places and among different sections,"" he said.Sources said the urgency of the campaign is underlined by the fact that RSS feels Maharashtra is important not only from the usual 'financial and industrial powerhouse' perspective but because, as one of the most advanced states, ""Maharashtra gets to define what is progress and what is progressive."" ""To have control over the narrative around progress and progressiveness is critical especially for a party that openly upholds traditional values,"" the RSS functionary said. This ideological aspect is key to BJP retaining Maharashtra.","The RSS has, through more than 65 friendly organisations, launched a campaign called 'Sajag Raho' ('Be Vigilant, Be Awake') in Maharashtra. The campaign is intended not only to bolster BJP's push in the assembly polls but as a pushback against what it sees as ""a larger attempt to keep Hindus divided and further atomise them""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115095970,imgsize-1735403,width-400,resizemode-4/115095970.jpg"

He said, ""Former PM Indira Gandhi had promised one rank, one pension (OROP), but Congress failed to keep the promise over the last 40 years. PM Narendra Modi, after coming to power, implemented OROP.""

""With the help of NGOs, Rahul is carrying out a conspiracy. At a recent event, the Constitution was distributed with blank pages. He waves 'Nakli Samvidhan'. Rahul has disrespected the Constitution. He wants to break the country on caste lines. No one will be allowed to touch reservations for SCs, STs, and OBCs,"" he said.Shah said Congress made changes in the waqf Act, which made it easy for the waqf board to grab land belonging to anyone. He alleged that in Karnataka, the Congress-led govt had transferred an entire village to the waqf board. ""If MVA forms govt, it will transfer land belonging to farmers to the waqf board. Pawar and Gandhi are against the changes needed in the waqf Act. We have drafted the bill. Whatever the opposition tries, we will get the bill passed in the upcoming session of Parliament,"" said Shah.Shah also took a dig at Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray for aligning with those ""who call Hindutva 'paakhand'."" He said, ""You (Uddhav) are sitting with those who protected the tombs of Afzal Khan and Aurangzeb. You are sitting with those who call Hindus terrorists. You are sitting with those who fed biryani to (26/11 Mumbai terror attack convict) Ajmal Kasab. And you are sitting with those who question the existence of Lord Ram.

CEC warns of action if parties and netas make anti-women remarks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cec-warns-of-action-if-parties-and-netas-make-anti-women-remarks/articleshow/115096009.cms,"MUMBAI: In a review meeting on the Maharashtra assembly polls on Friday, chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar strongly condemned undignified remarks made against female leaders during the election campaign.This comes in the wake of derogatory language used against Congress leader Jayshree Thorat by BJP politician Vasant Deshmukh in a public meeting and also comments made by Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Arvind Sawant about Shiv Sena candidate Shaina NC. Both incidents resulted in cases being lodged.Kumar urged political parties and candidates to refrain from any utterances or actions that may be construed as being repugnant to the honour and dignity of women. He told state officials that any remarks by candidates or political leaders which insulted the dignity of women and violated the model code of conduct should be met with stern action.Last week, NCP chief Sharad Pawar alleged that police vehicles were being used to transport cash to Mahayuti candidates. In response, Maharashtra's chief electoral officer S Chockalingam said that the district collectors were given strict instructions to prevent this.On Friday, Kumar also stated that there should be strict vigilance to prevent any possibility of misuse of govt vehicles like ambulances and vans for circulating cash and valuables. He also emphasised the need for a strict watch with night patrolling, especially during the silence period, and a strict vigil on attempts to offer inducements like cash, liquor, drugs or freebies to influence voters.Meanwhile, Kumar also urged state officials to try and enhance voter participation , especially in urban areas. He questioned why voters in regions like Bastar (68%) and Gadchiroli (78%) could come out and vote, but Colaba and Kalyan could not. Colaba in 2019 recorded only 40% voting, he said.In J&K, constituencies like Doda, Reasi, Poonch, and Rajouri all recorded turnout exceeding 70% in the recent assembly polls. Sensitive areas like Manipur recorded 78% turnout in the Lok Sabha polls. However, one of the constituencies in Mumbai South saw close to half of eligible electors skipping voting altogether, he noted. Kumar also mentioned some high-rises in Gurgaon and Faridabad saw a turnout of 20% even when polling stations were set up in their society buildings in the Haryana elections.","Chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar strongly condemned undignified remarks made against female leaders.

""After seeing how matters unfolded, my admiration for Anil Deshmukh (NCP SCP leader) and Sanjay Raut (Sena UBT leader) increased manifold. Despite being jailed, they stood their ground and did not give in to pressure,"" Supriya added. Recalling her meeting with some NCP 'rebels' at Devgiri bungalow, Ajit Pawar's official residence in Mumbai, just before her cousin and the others, took their oaths on July 2, 2023, Supriya said that six current ministers of Ajit Pawar's party had denied they were joining Mahayuti when they spoke to her.""I spoke to at least 20 people. I kept asking them, but nobody was honest with me. They kept denying that they were joining Mahayuti. There were six senior MLAs among these 20 who later took their oaths,"" she said.This is the first assembly election for Supriya as her party's working president after the NCP split. With only ten days of campaigning, she spent Friday visiting seven constituencies, participating in rallies, marches and meetings to campaign for MVA candidates in Pune.She said, ""I have travelled to various districts, and the response to MVA is quite good. People are suffering from inflation, unemployment, rising crime, and the agrarian crisis. But this govt is busy with vendetta politics which people rejected in the Lok Sabha poll, and will do so in the assembly election too."" On the possibility of an alliance with the BJP, Supriya said those who left the party were pushing party chief Sharad Pawar to join it, but he chose not to go with them.She said, ""Before switching sides, those members were pursuing Pawar Saheb to join hands with the BJP. However, he was clear right from the beginning that he would not join them and told them to make their own decisions. We also have differences with them on some serious policy issues.""The NCP (SCP) working president said, ""Narendra Modi, Amit Shah and Devendra Fadnavis have let the country and state down. They levelled serious allegations against us, calling the NCP Naturally Corrupt Party. They attempted to tarnish our reputation, and then they took half our party with them. Now, they will have to make up their minds on which NCP they have aligned with - the Nationalist Congress Party or the Naturally Corrupt Party.""The MP also claimed that the BJP did not spare her family members. ""My cousins Vijaya Patil, Neeta Patil, and Rajani Indulkar's residences were raided by central agencies. They have no connection to politics, but this is how the invisible power, which uses agencies to create fear in the minds of people, works.""She said her father is a fighter. ""When he was threatened with an ED notice, he got up and said, ""I will come to you instead of you coming to my house.' Everybody deals with issues in different ways. There is a lot to say, but it is not necessary to bring everything out in public,"" she said.On her possibility of becoming the chief minister, a post her father held four times, Supriya said, ""Our politics is very different.

SHIMLA: Samosas and cakes meant for Himachal Pradesh chief minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu were served to his security staff instead, the goof-up snowballing into controversy and necessitating a CID probe that termed it an ""anti-government"" act.Those responsible acted according to their own agenda, a highly placed official in the CID said in his note on the October 21 incident when the chief minister was visiting the CID headquarters. The brouhaha started when three boxes of the refreshments were brought from Hotel Radisson Blue in Lakkar Bazaar to be served to the chief minister who had gone to the CID headquarters to attend a function.However, the eatables were served to the CM security staff, according to the enquiry report conducted by a deputy SP rank officer.The report stated that an officer of IG rank had asked a sub-inspector (SI) of police to get some eatables from the hotel for the CM's visit.The SI in turn directed an assistant SI (ASI) and a head constable to bring the refreshments.The ASI and the head constable fetched the refreshments from the hotel in three sealed boxes and informed the SI.The police officers in their statement said when they asked the tourism department staff on duty whether the snacks in the three boxes were to be served to the chief minister, they said they were not included in the menu.The inquiry report said only the said SI, who deputed the ASI and the head constable with the task of getting the snacks from the hotel, was aware of the fact that the three boxes were for Sukhu.The lady inspector, to whom the food items were handed over, did not ask any senior officer and sent the refreshments to the mechanical transport (MT) section which deals with refreshments. The three boxes of refreshments exchanged several hands in the process.The controversy has given the BJP an opportunity to slam the Sukhu govt. “The state govt is not concerned about the development of the state and its only concern seems to be the ‘chief minister’s samosa',"" said BJP chief spokesperson Randhir Sharma on Thursday.","Samosas and cakes meant for Himachal Pradesh chief minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu were served to his security staff.

The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections , which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases. The results will be declared on November 23, along with Maharashtra.In the Tribal-dominated state, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and CM Hemant's Soren Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) are in a direct fight, while the Congress party and Lalu Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) are in alliance with the JMM.The JMM-Congress-RJD alliance are also reportedly seeking to deal with Left parties, Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party and other tribal outfits that have been contesting the elections in the state as independent entities and make efforts to field candidates against the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) on all 81 seats collectively.In the last assembly polls in 2019, the JMM-Congress-RJD alliance won a comfortable majority of 47 seats in a House of 81.The BJP slipped to 25 seats from 37 it held in 2014. The poor performance was perceived to be the outcome of its decision to contest alone backfiring. The party did not foster an alliance with the Ajsu in the 2019 polls when Raghubar Das, currently the Odisha governor, was serving the state as CM.In this year's Lok Sabha polls in Jharkhand, the BJP-led NDA secured nine out of the 14 seats, with the BJP winning eight and its alliance partner, the Ajsu (All Jharkhand Students Union) Party, retaining its single seat.On the other hand, the opposition India bloc improved its tally, increasing its seat count from two in 2019 to five in the parliamentary polls.BJP and JMM have spruced up their pace of campaigning from the ground zero to social media. BJP and JMM leaders are actively rebutting and challenging each other on a range of issues, including illegal immigration, youth welfare, employment and housing.INDIA bloc parties in Jharkhand slammed the EC for holding assembly elections in the state along with that of Maharashtra but claimed that they were ready to slug it out with BJP-led NDA, which has welcomed the announcement of poll dates.JMM, Congress, and CPI (ML-L) said the announcement showed that EC was in a hurry to conduct elections though the assembly tenure was due to end in January next year.Also, both the INDIA bloc and BJP-led NDA are expected to get into huddles to discuss the modalities of seat-sharing which is going to be a challenge for both the competing teams.","The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections, which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra. Elections in Maharashtra will be held in single phase on November 20. The counting of votes will be on November 23.Maharashtra is gearing up for elections as the two major political alliances—the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) and the Mahayuti—prepare to face each other for the first time in a Vidhan Sabha election.The Maha Vikas Aghadi, comprise of the Congress, the Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray), and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) under Sharad Pawar, will go head-to-head with the Mahayuti , which includes the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Shiv Sena faction led by Eknath Shinde, and the NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar. This will be the first electoral contest between these two alliances since the splits within the Shiv Sena and NCP.The MVA is hopeful of replicating its recent Lok Sabha success, while the Mahayuti aims to retain power by leveraging its populist schemes targeted at women and youth. Both alliances have set their sights on winning the state.Narayan Rane, a former Union Minister and the victor in the Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg Lok Sabha constituency, is poised to be a key figure for the BJP in the Konkan region during the forthcoming elections. Meanwhile, two constituencies are expected to be critical battlegrounds: chief minister Eknath Shinde's Kopri-Pachpakdi seat in Thane City and Worli in Mumbai, where Aaditya Thackeray, a leader of the Shiv Sena (UBT), is seeking reelection.In the last Vidhan Sabha elections in 2019, the BJP secured 26.1% of the votes, the Congress 16.1%, the NCP 16.9%, and the Shiv Sena 16.6%. The BJP and the Shiv Sena (then united) formed the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which secured a majority. However, the coalition soon crumbled due to disagreements over government formation, plunging the state into a political crisis.After no party could establish a government, Maharashtra was placed under President's rule. Devendra Fadnavis was briefly sworn in as chief minister, with Ajit Pawar as deputy chief minister. However, both resigned just days later before a scheduled floor test.By November 28, 2019, a new coalition emerged, with the Shiv Sena (Uddhav faction), NCP (Sharad Pawar faction), and Congress forming the Maha Vikas Aghadi government, led by Uddhav Thackeray as chief minister.The state's politics took another turn in June, 2022, when Uddhav Thackeray resigned following a rebellion within the Shiv Sena, led by Eknath Shinde, who then allied with the BJP. Eknath Shinde assumed the role of chief minister, with Devendra Fadnavis returning as deputy chief minister.",The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra.

NEW DELHI: BJP on Thursday said the resolution passed by the “INDI alliance” in the Jammu and Kashmir assembly to restore the special status of the erstwhile state was akin to “waging a war against the Indian constitution, Supreme Court and Parliament”.“I ask INDI alliance parties to explain who has given them rights to defy Supreme Court, Indian Constitution and Parliament. The resolution is a tactical support of Congress and its allies to terrorists and separatists,” BJP leader Smriti Irani said at a press conference. She said passage of the resolution seeking restoration of special status was an “attempt to divide India” by the INDIA bloc parties and added that BJP would not let them succeed in their effort.“I want to assure all leaders of the INDI alliance and citizens of the country that the abrogation of Article 370, passed by Parliament, will not be restored. And their effort to divide India will not succeed,” she added.Slamming the National Conference-led coalition govt for the resolution, Irani said, “The govt, elected through the democratic framework, is giving evidence of breaking India instead of working on development issues and uniting India.” After abrogation of Article 370, J&K witnessed a decline in terror incidents by 70& and deaths in such incidents came down by 80%, the former Union minister said.Irani also took on Congress over the resolution and asked the party leadership if it stood for terrorism.She also asked if the Congress-led “INDI alliance” stood against the “economic and constitutional interests” of J&K as well as the rights that the tribal population, Dalits, OBCs, women and children have got with the revocation of Article 370.“What they seek is special status for themselves, not the people of J&K,” she said.","BJP leader Smriti Irani said the resolution was akin to “waging a war against the Indian constitution, Supreme Court and Parliament’ Irani also took on Congress over the resolution and asked the party leadership if it stood for terrorism.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115062638,imgsize-929081,width-400,resizemode-4/115062638.jpg"
