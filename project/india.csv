'They should abandon the mindset of spoilt prince': BJP slams Congress after ECI rejects Haryana poll claims,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/they-should-abandon-the-mindset-of-spoilt-prince-bjp-slams-congress-after-eci-rejects-haryana-poll-claims/articleshow/114779669.cms,"Sudhanshu Trivedi

NEW DELHI: The Bhartiya Janata Party ( BJP ) MP and national spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi launched a fierce attack on Congress party for its allegations against Election Commission (EC) on Wednesday. He pointed to the EC's detailed 1,642-page response to Congress's accusations, calling it evidence of grand old party's ""vengeful pride"" and ""suspiciously covert"" motives.Trivedi raised questions about Congress's selective criticism of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs). He pointed out that EVMs functioned without issues in Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, and Delhi but allegedly malfunctioned in Rajasthan in 2023 and in Haryana.""The EC's extensive 1,642-page response to Congress's baseless and absurd accusations underscores the party's vengeful pride for power--'I am right if I win, and if I lose, someone else is responsible.' This attitude isn't merely amusing but suspicious. Congress's attempts to cast aspersions on the dignity of constitutional institutions are not just ridiculous; they are slyly subversive,"" Trivedi said during a press conference in New Delhi.He questioned why EVMs worked well in some states but allegedly failed in others. ""EVMs worked perfectly in Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Himachal, and Delhi. They performed well in Rajasthan in 2018 but not in 2023. In Haryana, they allegedly malfunctioned,"" Trivedi added.Trivedi suggested that Congress's confidence after winning 99 seats in the recent Lok Sabha elections might have contributed to their loss in Haryana. ""In the intoxication of '99' and the arrogance of believing power is theirs by right, they should abandon the mindset of a 'spoilt prince' that caused this 'accident.' The public views such accusations with suspicion,"" he said.Trivedi also targeted Congress leader Rahul Gandhi 's ""unofficial MP"" remark, arguing it jeopardizes democracy. He said, ""Congress's most prominent and energetic leader claimed he'd remain an unofficial MP. This party, with an unofficial PM for 10 years, still has an unofficial president and, possibly, an unofficial CM in Delhi. Yet they raise their voice against the official constitutional bodies of our country, putting democracy at risk.""The EC rejected Congress's allegations of irregularities in Haryana's recent elections, calling them ""baseless, misplaced, and devoid of facts."" The ECI urged Congress to stop making groundless accusations, warning that such claims could lead to public unrest and chaos.In a letter to Congress, the ECI advised the party to exercise caution and employ due diligence rather than repeatedly casting unfounded criticism on electoral processes . The ECI confirmed that each stage of the Haryana election was flawless and observed by Congress candidates or their agents.Regarding concerns about the EVM battery display, the ECI clarified that the battery voltage and capacity are irrelevant to the machines' vote-counting function and integrity.

"Close to 150 rebels in Maharashtra poll fray, pose challenge to MVA & Mahayuti",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/close-to-150-rebels-in-maharashtra-poll-fray-pose-challenge-to-mva-mahayuti/articleshow/114750421.cms,"MUMBAI/NAGPUR: Rebels threatened to become a headache for the two major alliances in the state as nominations for the assembly polls drew to a close Tuesday. While Mahayuti identified 80 rebels, close to 150 politicians in all from across parties have filed nominations in defiance of their party's, or multi-party alliance's, official candidates. With Nov 4 being the last date for withdrawing nominations, the fronts have nearly a week to sort out differences and persuade rebels to pull out of the fray.Both the MVA and the Mahayuti said they had declared candidates for all 288 seats.After nominations closed, MVA had accounted for 286 of its nominees filing papers (103 from Congress - final figure for that party - 96 from Sena-UBT and 87 from Sharad Pawar-led NCP), with the three parties giving seats from their own quotas to smaller allies. In Mahayuti, the count came to 284 (BJ, Shiv Sena 80 and NCP 52), including smaller allies. Both alliances said the remaining seats would be accounted for once information came in from various parts of the state. However, from Mahayuti list, it appears it has declared two candidates in 5 constituencies, and none in two seats; it has declared 289 candidates in all.Among the prominent rebels are BJP's Gopal Shetty from Borivli who has filed papers against his party's official candidate Sanjay Upadhyay and NCP minister Chhagan Bhujbal's nephew Sameer, who has filed his nomination as an independent candidate from Nandgaon assembly constituency in Nashik district against Shiv Sena MLA Suhas Kande.Prominent netas of Mahayuti and MVA admitted that the presence of rebels in the fray is a cause for concern and that they would have to tackle the matter. There is time still to do that: papers of candidates will be scrutinised on Wednesday and Nov 4 is the last date for withdrawal of candidatures. After that, a clear picture will emerge on the number of rebels still left in the fray.While the confusion that prevailed for a fortnight over who would contest how many seats more or less ended on Tuesday, significantly the Mahayuti, despite several rounds of talks, kept its seat-sharing formula secret throughout, while MVA's formula kept changing publicly. Initially, it was proposed that Congress would contest 103 seats, UBT Shiv Sena 90, and NCP (SP) 85. Later, UBT Sena MP Sanjay Raut proposed a formula of 85 seats each, and since there was no consensus on that, Congress legislature party leader Balasaheb Thorat proposed a new formula, where all constituents of MVA would contest 90 seats each. The dispute was then taken to the court of the AICC, followed by separate meetings with Sharad Pawar and Uddhav Thackeray, after which the issue was resolved. ""There was no fixed formula; seats were decided based on merit and the winnability factor,"" a senior Congress politician said.State NCP president Sunil Tatkare said the seat-sharing formula of the Mahayuti was decided after considering all factors. ""We took note of the winnability factor. I am sure that the Mahayuti will retain power in the state,"" he said. Tatkare has convened a meeting of all senior leaders of his party on Wednesday to take stock of the political situation. ""We will meet our senior leaders to resolve intra-party disputes,"" Tatkare said.Mumbai BJP chief Ashish Shelar was also confident of Mahayuti's win, saying selection of candidates was purely on merit and their ability to deliver and to tackle problems faced by the people. ""We will lead once again,"" Shelar said. Shelar felt the political picture in the state would be clear after the last date of withdrawal of nominations. ""We will know the exact number of candidates in the fray after the last date of withdrawal,"" he said.AICC secretary Ramesh Chennithala said that the people of Maharashtra would reject the ""corrupt"" Mahayuti govt led by Eknath Shinde.","Close to 150 politicians in all from across parties have filed nominations in defiance of their party's official candidates.

The doors were sealed at 3pm. Ahmed remained at the returning officer's camp till 8pm, pleading that his nomination be accepted. He cited his difficult trek with an injured knee to the collectorate office as the administration had restricted road access. Ahmed cited time constraints following his exit from Congress Sunday and his subsequent journey to Mumbai for induction in VBA, and Tuesday's nomination.""Securing NOCs, clearance certificates, establishing nationalised bank accounts kept me tied up till 2.30pm,"" he said. The development drew sharp reactions from several quarters who dubbed the act as a ploy to skip the electoral battle. Sources said the blot of indirectly helping BJP played on his mind and this froze his desire to contest.

‘A large number in all parties’: Fadnavis admits rebel trouble,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/a-large-number-in-all-parties-fadnavis-admits-rebel-trouble/articleshow/114791967.cms,"MUMBAI: Deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis on Wednesday acknowledged the problem posed by rebel candidates , saying there is a large number of them in all parties. “Our efforts will be to persuade them to withdraw (from the fray),” he told reporters in Mumbai.When the MCC was announced, the Mahayuti coordination committee had announced that it would set up similar committees in every assembly constituency with representatives from all three parties. This was done to ensure that those not getting tickets could be persuaded not to rebel. However, the committees don’t seem to have worked.One of the biggest rebellions that has emerged is in Mumbai, with former MP Gopal Shetty raising the issue of locals versus outsiders within the party. Shetty has affirmed he will fight the polls as an Independent, although party functionaries are confident that they will be able to persuade him to pull out. BJP succeeded in ensuring that former MLAs from south Mumbai Raj Purohit and Atul Shah did not file papers as Independents. In Kothrud, it' is learnt that Amol Balwadkar, a BJP rebel candidate, declared his support for Chandrakant Patil, BJP’s official candidate, following a raid by I-T dept on his brother-in-law.Sanjay Patil, a researcher in dept of civics and politics at University of Mumbai, said BJP appears vulnerable and not confident of winning the polls. “In 2014, it fought on its own and emerged as the single largest party in the state. In 2019, despite an alliance with Sena, BJP’s seats went down from 122 to 105. It also failed to negotiate a deal with its oldest ally. For last five years, it could not have its CM in the state.”While the Haryana results buoyed the party in Maharashtra, observers said unless BJP can convince its workers that the CM will be from the party, they will not be inclined to work hard. “Elective merit is only point driving the polls. There is a complete absence of ideology and, hence, the large number of rebels,” said Ajay Vaidya, a political analyst.","Deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis says there is a large number of rebel candidates in all parties.

Congress is likely to assure voters that Mahayuti govt’s Ladki Bahin Yojana providing monthly financial assistance to eligible women would not be discontinued. With the Mahayuti banking on the welfare schemes it had launched in the run up to the elections, Congress is likely to rely on the promises and programmes that helped it win Karnataka and Telangana assembly elections. In Telangana, Congress had declared loan waiver up to Rs 25 lakh for farmers, Rs 25 lakh health insurance, and time-bound plan for filling vacant govt posts, while in Karnataka, party had launched the Gruha Laxmi scheme, which is on the lines of Ladki Bahin Yojana.Meanwhile, maintaining that the alliance was intact, AICC general secretary Ramesh Chennithala said there was no dispute over the seat-sharing formula. “There will be no friendly contest in the state and MVA will secure a clear majority,” he added.

CM Omar Abdullah said as much Monday — that the current phase of J&K’s status is provisional.On Oct 24, Omar presented a resolution for statehood restoration to PM Modi and handed a copy to Union home minister Amit Shah. “I met several BJP top functionaries and got assurance from the highest level on the change in the governance model of J&K,” Omar said, adding that his recent meetings in Delhi had been “very successful”.The administration led by LG Manoj Sinha plans to mark J&K’s transition to UT status in 2019, following the abrogation of Article 370 that guaranteed special status to the former state. However, the absence of key parties from the event in Srinagar underscores the ongoing political tensions over the constitutional changes made five years ago.NC’s chief spokesperson Tanvir Sadiq condemned the observance, calling it “unfair” and a celebration of the “unconstitutional” revocation of the region’s status. NC had campaigned for statehood restoration as a key promise in the assembly elections. “Our manifesto is committed to restoring J&K’s unique legacy,” Sadiq said.CPM’s Kulgam MLA Mohammad Yousuf Tarigami criticised the transition to UT status, saying “assaulting constitutional rights of the citizens shouldn’t be celebrated”. Congress MLA and party’s J&K president Tariq Hamid Karra said: “We have decided not to participate…because we have never recognised J&K as UT.”While opinions on J&K’s status remain divided, both residents of Jammu and Kashmir appear united in their demand for statehood. Jammu residents argued that the downgrade from state to UT has deprived local authorities of essential powers. Kashmiris said the change has brought both political and economic setbacks, with increased control from New Delhi through the LG’s office.","National Conference (NC), Congress and CPM along with opposition PDP announced their decision to boycott the Union territory’s (UT) foundation day celebrations Thursday.

The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections , which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases. The results will be declared on November 23, along with Maharashtra.In the Tribal-dominated state, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and CM Hemant's Soren Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) are in a direct fight, while the Congress party and Lalu Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) are in alliance with the JMM.The JMM-Congress-RJD alliance are also reportedly seeking to deal with Left parties, Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party and other tribal outfits that have been contesting the elections in the state as independent entities and make efforts to field candidates against the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) on all 81 seats collectively.In the last assembly polls in 2019, the JMM-Congress-RJD alliance won a comfortable majority of 47 seats in a House of 81.The BJP slipped to 25 seats from 37 it held in 2014. The poor performance was perceived to be the outcome of its decision to contest alone backfiring. The party did not foster an alliance with the Ajsu in the 2019 polls when Raghubar Das, currently the Odisha governor, was serving the state as CM.In this year's Lok Sabha polls in Jharkhand, the BJP-led NDA secured nine out of the 14 seats, with the BJP winning eight and its alliance partner, the Ajsu (All Jharkhand Students Union) Party, retaining its single seat.On the other hand, the opposition India bloc improved its tally, increasing its seat count from two in 2019 to five in the parliamentary polls.BJP and JMM have spruced up their pace of campaigning from the ground zero to social media. BJP and JMM leaders are actively rebutting and challenging each other on a range of issues, including illegal immigration, youth welfare, employment and housing.INDIA bloc parties in Jharkhand slammed the EC for holding assembly elections in the state along with that of Maharashtra but claimed that they were ready to slug it out with BJP-led NDA, which has welcomed the announcement of poll dates.JMM, Congress, and CPI (ML-L) said the announcement showed that EC was in a hurry to conduct elections though the assembly tenure was due to end in January next year.Also, both the INDIA bloc and BJP-led NDA are expected to get into huddles to discuss the modalities of seat-sharing which is going to be a challenge for both the competing teams.","The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections, which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra. Elections in Maharashtra will be held in single phase on November 20. The counting of votes will be on November 23.Maharashtra is gearing up for elections as the two major political alliances—the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) and the Mahayuti—prepare to face each other for the first time in a Vidhan Sabha election.The Maha Vikas Aghadi, comprise of the Congress, the Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray), and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) under Sharad Pawar, will go head-to-head with the Mahayuti , which includes the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Shiv Sena faction led by Eknath Shinde, and the NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar. This will be the first electoral contest between these two alliances since the splits within the Shiv Sena and NCP.The MVA is hopeful of replicating its recent Lok Sabha success, while the Mahayuti aims to retain power by leveraging its populist schemes targeted at women and youth. Both alliances have set their sights on winning the state.Narayan Rane, a former Union Minister and the victor in the Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg Lok Sabha constituency, is poised to be a key figure for the BJP in the Konkan region during the forthcoming elections. Meanwhile, two constituencies are expected to be critical battlegrounds: chief minister Eknath Shinde's Kopri-Pachpakdi seat in Thane City and Worli in Mumbai, where Aaditya Thackeray, a leader of the Shiv Sena (UBT), is seeking reelection.In the last Vidhan Sabha elections in 2019, the BJP secured 26.1% of the votes, the Congress 16.1%, the NCP 16.9%, and the Shiv Sena 16.6%. The BJP and the Shiv Sena (then united) formed the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which secured a majority. However, the coalition soon crumbled due to disagreements over government formation, plunging the state into a political crisis.After no party could establish a government, Maharashtra was placed under President's rule. Devendra Fadnavis was briefly sworn in as chief minister, with Ajit Pawar as deputy chief minister. However, both resigned just days later before a scheduled floor test.By November 28, 2019, a new coalition emerged, with the Shiv Sena (Uddhav faction), NCP (Sharad Pawar faction), and Congress forming the Maha Vikas Aghadi government, led by Uddhav Thackeray as chief minister.The state's politics took another turn in June, 2022, when Uddhav Thackeray resigned following a rebellion within the Shiv Sena, led by Eknath Shinde, who then allied with the BJP. Eknath Shinde assumed the role of chief minister, with Devendra Fadnavis returning as deputy chief minister.",The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra. Elections in Maharashtra will be held in single phase on November 20. The counting of votes will be on November 23.
