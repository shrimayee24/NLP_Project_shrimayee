CHENNAI: A couple who complained that their 10-year-old daughter had been raped repeatedly by a neighbour were beaten by an Anna Nagar all-women police inspector and made to stay at the station till the early hours of Aug 31.The survivor, a Class VI student of a govt school, stood witness to the ill-treatment of her parents in the presence of the accused, Sathish, a water can supplier in the neighbourhood.He is yet to be arrested though the FIR was registered on Aug 31. The girl's father is a construction worker and her mother a cook.Though the incident came to light on Aug 29 and the case registered on Aug 31, the child is yet to get the mandatory counselling by a District Child Protection Officer (DCPO) or anyone from the Child Welfare Committee (CWC).On Aug 29, the girl's mother returned from work in the evening and found her writhing with pain in the stomach. She took her to a private clinic where a doctor examined said she had been raped. The girl was referred to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital (KMCH) where doctors said she had been sexually assaulted repeatedly.Informed by KMCH authorities, an Anna Nagar all-women police team visited the hospital. Contrary to rules, inspector Raji asked the mother to bring her Aadhaar card and other particulars to the station and held 'inquiry' with the child. (TOI is in possession of the audio clip).The inspector is heard repeatedly asking the girl why she mentioned Sathish's name and the girl saying she did it by mistake. She also tells police her cousin had sexually assaulted her in 2022.The survivor told her mother later that she didn't mention Sathish's name to police because he had threatened to orphan her by doing away with her parents and her younger sister.After the 'inquiry' with the survivor, the inspector summoned her parents to the station where they were asked to stay till the early hours of the next day.""When we entered the inspector's room around 1am, police attacked me. A male constable hit my husband repeatedly on the back,"" the girl's mother told TOI. She is now being assisted by the coordinator of a service organisation AIMS , Kanya.When contacted, inspector Raji told TOI, ""You should not ask about Pocso cases to the investigation officer. It is a sensational case."" TOI then contacted Anna Nagar deputy commissioner Snehapriya who denied any such attack on the complainant at Anna Nagar all-women police station.The girl is now at KMCH and the CWC is yet to forward the case to the DCPO to assign a child counsellor to help her.CWC chairperson Rajkumar Muthukrishnam told TOI: ""I was not aware of this case. As per procedure, we will forward it to the DCPO and assign a counsellor to speak to the girl.""","The incident came to light on Aug 29 and the case registered on Aug 31.

NEW DELHI: Talks between Congress and AAP over an alliance in Haryana have hit a deadlock on the number and nature of constituencies to be ceded to Arvind Kejriwal's outfit, with insiders dubbing prospects of a tie-up as unlikely.Sources in AAP, which always looked keener for the unexpected partnership and had remained hopeful of swinging it, sounded pessimistic about the possibility of an alliance and said the party was preparing to fight on 50 seats.Asked by mediapersons about the fate of the negotiations, AAP's Rajya Sabha MP Raghav Chadha said, ""We are still talking and we are hopeful that an alliance will happen for the good of the country and Haryana. All possible efforts are being made in that direction."" AAP sources, however, admitted that talks had hit a deadlock because of Congress's reluctance to leave 10 seats and the party was readying its list for 50 seats and may announce the candidates on Sunday. Congress sources confirmed that it was unwilling to leave more than 3-4 seats for AAP.The key concern in Congress is the cost if the alliance fails to work in the northern state. Sources said the seats that AAP has sought are such that ""transfer of votes"" between the allies may be difficult. In the process, BJP would be the beneficiary.","Talks between Congress and AAP over an alliance in Haryana have hit a deadlock on the number and nature of constituencies to be ceded to Arvind Kejriwal's outfit.

BHUBANESWAR: Less than two months after BJD's Mamata Mohanta quit Rajya Sabha and the party and joined BJP , the Naveen Patnaik-led party suffered another blow with another RS MP Sujeet Kumar resigning from the Upper House and BJD on Friday.Later, he joined BJP, boosting the party's prospects of increasing its tally in RS. Sujeet, who joined BJP at an event in Delhi in the presence of Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan , said he was fed up with corruption within BJD and the leadership's reluctance to listen when he tried to bring it to their notice.Sujeet's resignation letter from RS, 18 months ahead of his six year-term which is supposed to end on Apr 2, 2026, did not provide any specific reason for his decision to step down. On whether he was promised re-nomination to Rajya Sabha, the lawyer-turned-politician said, ""I am ready for whatever responsibility is offered to me."" Pradhan said ""Sujeet can make meaningful contributions to BJP's focus on Viksit Odisha and Viksit Bharat"".Given that BJP has 78 members in the 147-member Odisha assembly , the party is comfortably placed to win the Rajya Sabha bypoll whenever it is scheduled. BJP currently has 96 members in the 245-member Upper House, including two from Odisha. Pramila Mallik , BJD chief whip in the assembly, said BJP has resorted to conspiracy to break other parties as it is desperate to increase its tally in Rajya Sabha.","Sujeet Kumar resigned from the Upper House and BJD on Friday.

BJP may accommodate deprived candidates in other constituencies

CHANDIGARH/ROHTAK/PANIPAT: BJP's core committee called an emergency meeting on Friday in New Delhi as senior BJP politicians, including former ministers, MLAs and other party seniors, continued to fume at not finding a place in the list of candidates for the Haryana assembly polls or feared that they would be dropped.The meeting is learned to have been attended by Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan, Lok Sabha MP Biplab Deb, organisation secretary Phanindranath Sharma, Haryana chief minister Nayab Singh Saini and state BJP president Mohan Lal Badoli.Though resentment in the party was discussed, sources privy to the outcome ruled out the possibility of alteration of the candidate list on this account.Later on Friday evening CM Saini told reporters there would be no change in candidates declared by BJP. He said everyone desires to get a ticket ""but the lotus flower is one and can be given to only one. It is natural for ticket-seekers to be angry. But they will be persuaded.""On Wednesday, BJP's central parliamentary board released its first list, of 67 candidates, for the 90-member Haryana assembly and dropped three sitting ministers, nine MLAs and other seniors and former ministers, including Bishambar Balmiki and Ranjit Singh Chautala. BJP Mahila Morcha office-bearer Latika Sharma, from Kalka, too, was dropped.Sources said that during the meeting, a strategy was formed to deal with the situation arising out of resentment among deprived ticket aspirants and measures to be taken, including counselling. ""There is very little scope of alteration in the list, unless any exceptionally high situation arises. However, there is a possibility of adjusting those deprived in other constituencies as we have 23 constituencies where candidates have to be finalised,"" a senior BJP functionary privy to the development said.Winnability was the sole criteria in picking candidates. All this has been done on the basis of rigorous exercises and surveys and meetings at various levels, hence there seems to be little scope for alteration, a politician said.Prominent among those who expressed surprise and made dissenting noises over the candidate selection were former minister Ram Bilas Sharma and his supporters, Karnal former mayor Renu Gupta, and former minister Kavita Jain and her husband Rajeev Jain in Sonipat.In a related development, former minister Karan Dev Kamboj attacked BJP, while Ratia MLA Lakshman Napa, along with hundreds of supporters, joined Congress in New Delhi. Napa did not receive a ticket and BJP picked former MP Sunita Duggal from that seat.Former BJP MLA Naresh Kaushik, who was denied a party ticket, broke down in front of supporters in Bahadurgarh, in Haryana's Jhajjar district, on Friday.","Senior BJP politicians fume at not finding a place in the list of candidates for the Haryana assembly polls.

""Agar woh desh ki beti sey Congress ki beti banna chaahti hai, to hamein kya etraaz hai,"" he added.Vij said the Congress was trying to bring these players with them from the very first day and it was due to their instigation that the wrestlers started the movement in Delhi.

HC CJ on his own can’t reject candidate for judgeship: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hc-cj-on-his-own-cant-reject-candidate-for-judgeship-supreme-court/articleshow/113141006.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a first-of-its-kind order relating to the three-decade-old judges-selecting-judges mechanism , Supreme Court Friday ruled that high court collegiums collectively decide on recommending names for appointment as HC judges and said a HC chief justice individually can't take a call in this regard.A bench of Justices Hrishikesh Roy and Prashant K Mishra gave this ruling while directing Himachal Pradesh HC collegium to reconsider the suitability of two district judges - Chirag Bhanu Singh and Arvind Malhotra - for appointment as HC judges.Singh and Malhotra had jointly moved a petition questioning the validity of HC CJ 's individual decision to decline reconsideration of their names even after the SC collegium had on Jan 4 asked the HC collegium to reconsider their suitability. HC had questioned maintainability of the petition as it appeared to question the collegium system of selecting persons for appointment as HC judges.Ruling in favour of the two district judges, the bench said the petition was maintainable, pointing out a procedural lapse as the HC CJ had individually taken the decision when it should have been taken collectively by the CJ and two most senior judges of HC.""The decision of the HC CJ, on the suitability of the two petitioners as conveyed in his letter dated 6th March 2024, appears to be an individual decision. The same therefore stands vitiated both procedurally and substantially,"" the bench said.Writing the judgment, Justice Roy said the letter addressed by the SC collegium to the HC CJ does not enable him to act without participation by the other two collegium members. ""This court is mindful of the limited scope of interference in such matters. But this appears to be a case where there was no collective consultation amongst the threeConstitutional functionaries of high court i.e. the chief justice and two senior-most companion judges,"" he said.""Absence of the element of plurality, in the process of reconsideration as directed by the SC collegium, is clearly discernible,"" the bench said.HC had shown SC a letter written by one of the judicial officers giving vent to his hurt feelings for getting ignored by HC despite having an unblemished judicial record and argued that the letter was contemptuous.Brushing aside HC's argument, Justices Roy and Mishra said, ""We have perused the letter. It is definitely an expression of hurt by the judicial officer but will not bring the letter into the contemptuous category.""""In light of the above, the HC collegium should now reconsider the names of Chirag Bhanu Singh and Arvind Malhotra for elevation as judges of HC, following the SC Collegium decision dated 4th Jan, 2024 and law minister's letter dated 16th Jan, 2024.

NEW DELHI: A day after meeting Rahul Gandhi , wrestlers Vinesh Phogat and Bajrang Punia joined Congress on Friday, lashing out at BJP for ""ditching them"" during their struggle for honour. Late at night, Phogat was announced as the Congress candidate from Julana assembly constituency. The party also issued a statement announcing the appointment of Punia as the working chairman of All India Kisan Congress with immediate effect.Congress general secretary K C Venugopal, flanked by Haryana unit chief Uday Bhan, state in-charge Deepak Babaria and spokesman Pawan Khera, welcomed the two wrestlers and said ""it is a proud moment for Congress"".The wrestlers said they ""will not be scared or back off"" and will carry on their struggle. The duo also met Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge at his residence.Venugopal complained that railways Friday issued a showcause notice to Phogat for meeting Rahul Gandhi even though she has resigned from her job. He said the country stands with the Olympian wrestlers and the govt should relieve her from her duties without delay, and ""not play politics"". He said Punia too received a showcause notice. ""Is it a crime to stand with the leader of opposition of the country,"" he asked.Profusely thanking Congress, Phogat said, ""It is in tough times that one comes to know about the well-wishers. When we were dragged on the roads, all the parties except BJP stood with us and associated with our pain."" Instead, she said, BJP chose to support Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, then MP and Wrestling Federation chief against whom they had levelled charges of sexual harassment. Punia urged the country to review their support for BJP ""which is harassing women, farmers, jawans"".With their political plunge coming in the backdrop of upcoming Haryana polls , Punia and Phogat left no doubt that BJP is their target. While Phogat refused to comment if her disqualification in the Olympics was part of a ""conspiracy"" as alleged by many in the country and said she would speak on the ""emotional issue"" after some time, Punia said the entire country was sad when Phogat was stripped of the final match but the BJP IT cell chose to celebrate.Phogat said the BJP IT cell had convinced the country that she was a spent force who was protesting because she did not want to contest the nationals and wanted to avoid the trials. ""But I did all of that and even went to the Olympics,"" she remarked.Venugopal said political leaders come through movements, and Phogat and Punia have come through a big movement.","Wrestlers Vinesh Phogat and Bajrang Punia joined Congress on Friday.

Political outrage over Ujjain rape

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

INDORE: A woman has been raped in public , in broad daylight in temple town Ujjain , leaving the state reeling in shock and horror.The rape happened on a footpath in Koyla Phatak area, one of the busiest intersections in Ujjain, on Wednesday afternoon. Scores witnessed it yet nobody intervened. Instead, someone filmed the sexual assault and posted it on social media.A political storm has erupted, with opposition Congress criticising BJP govt for the ‘worsening law and order’ in MP . Ujjain is CM Mohan Yadav’s hometown and he also holds the home portfolio.Once the shocking footage showed up on social media on Thursday night, police traced the survivor, a ragpicker, and took her for medical tests. According to Ujjain SP Pradeep Sharma, she was brought to the police station, where a case was registered. “Accused Lokesh has been arrested . She says she knew him.
