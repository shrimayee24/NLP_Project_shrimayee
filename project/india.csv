Shantanu Gupta Explains Ram Mandir Controversy & Rajnath Singh On Congress And Babri Masjid

Modi, Shah, Nadda in

Bengal this month

KOLKATA: Former Bengal BJP chief Dilip Ghosh escalated tensions within the party after Wednesday's meeting with Union minister Amit Shah , questioning the electoral utility of ""mandir-masjid politics"" and taking veiled digs at ""recent entrants"" to the state unit.""Mandir-masjid issues do not impact poll results,"" Ghosh said Thursday, citing BJP's loss in Faizabad LS constituency in 2024 despite Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. He said it would be ""wrong to assume"" Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee could win 2026 assembly polls by building temples.Without naming anyone, Ghosh said, ""Everyone is a worker in BJP. Recent entrants have to prove their identity."" The remark was widely read as a swipe at politicians who joined from TMC before 2021 assembly polls.Ghosh met state BJP president Samik Bhattacharya and sought permission to campaign for three days in Kharagpur from Saturday, saying he wanted to contest his home seat in 2026 assembly polls. He also spoke openly about being sidelined: ""Baseless, agenda-driven theories were floated and I was isolated. I have told the central brass this. I am not afraid of getting lost. I have faith in them.""PM Narendra Modi will likely hold a rally in north Bengal in the third week of Jan and Union home minister Amit Shah is expected to visit Kolkata by the end of the month. Union minister and BJP former chief JP Nadda is also scheduled to visit the city on Jan 8, said sources.","Dilip Ghosh questions electoral utility of ""mandir-masjid politics"" Former Bengal BJP chief takes veiled digs at ""recent entrants"" to state unit.

'Padmaavat' protests: Court refuses to permit Gujarat govt to withdraw case against 19 Karni Sena activists,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/padmavat-protests-court-refuses-to-permit-gujarat-govt-to-withdraw-case-against-19-karni-sena-activists/articleshow/126296214.cms,"Gujarat govt's plea rejected

Accused not criminals but youth high on emotions: Court

AHMEDABAD: A sessions court refused to permit Gujarat govt to withdraw a criminal case against 19 Karni Sena activists, who were booked for vandalising a mall, torching vehicles and damaging property during their protest against the release of the film 'Padmavat' in 2018.The court said the alleged offence was committed ""to achieve personal interest and to maintain dominance of a particular community, ignoring the public interest"". It noted that the accused caused damage to the tune of Rs 16.4 lakh during the rioting. tnnKarni Sena's candle march on Jan 23, 2018, in protest against the movie event took a violent turn, with 19 participants being booked for rioting, unlawful assembly, arson, and criminal conspiracy under provisions of IPC, section 3(1) of Damages to Public Property Act and section 135(1) of Gujarat Police Act. After investigation, police filed a chargesheet and the case has been pending in a sessions court since 2019.The state govt first requested a JMFC court to allow it to withdraw the case under CrPC section 321, but the request was refused in 2022. It then approached the Ahmedabad (rural) sessions court and submitted that the decision to withdraw prosecution was based only on the interest of the public at large, and would be helpful in the administration of justice.The accused are not criminals but younsters who acted in the heat of passion and were high on emotions, it argued.However, additional sessions judge Hardik Shah said court can't permit withdrawal of prosecution merely because state govt issued an order to the public prosecutor. The court said the prosecutor did not apply his mind or express his opinion on the issue.","19 Karni Sena activists were booked for vandalising a mall, torching vehicles and damaging property during their protest against the release of the film 'Padmavat' in 2018.

MUMBAI: Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut on Thursday claimed the ruling BJP's agenda is to ensure that a 'Marathi manoos' does not become the mayor of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).Talking to reporters, Raut further claimed that the BJP wants to hurt the Marathi people.Responding to remarks made by BJP leader Kripashankar Singh that efforts would be made to ensure the election of a Hindi-speaking mayor in the Mira Bhayandar Municipal Corporation in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Raut said this is a conspiracy of the BJP.The statement by Singh was not done without any purpose but it was a strategy to create an atmosphere among outsiders against Shiv Sena (UBT) and the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena . Following this, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar Deputy Chief Ministers Keshav Prasad Maurya and Samrat Choudhary, respectively, would be brought in to campaign for the BJP for the civic body polls, he said.""The BJP has decided not to have a Marathi mayor in Mumbai or anywhere else. This is BJP's agenda,"" Raut said.""Its agenda is to ensure that a Marathi manoos does not lead Mumbai in the BMC and they are working towards it. Marathi manoos is solidly behind Shiv Sena (UBT) and MNS,"" the Rajya Sabha member added.His remarks come just a fortnight before the civic body polls in which the party is expected to harp on the son of soil issue.Raut said the BJP is not the party that works for the pride of Maharashtra. It has no link to the 'Samyukta Maharashtra' issue.Polls to 29 municipal corporations, including the cash-rich BMC controlled by the undivided Shiv Sena from 1997-2022, will be held on January 15, a race that is seen as one of the toughest battles for the Sena (UBT) and the MNS.",Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut claims the ruling BJP's agenda is to ensure that a 'Marathi manoos' does not become the mayor of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) Raut further claimed that the BJP wants to hurt the Marathi people.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126287950,imgsize-732196,width-400,resizemode-4/sanjay-raut.jpg"
