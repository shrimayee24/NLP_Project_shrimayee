"Courts and police are not recovery agents, says SC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/courts-and-police-are-not-recovery-agents-says-sc/articleshow/124059217.cms,"NEW DELHI: With police continuing to register FIRs in civil disputes, Supreme Court on Monday said the judiciary and police are not recovery agents and that threat of arrest could not be leveraged to settle such disputes.The remark from a bench of Justices Surya Kant and N K Singh came after it found that a purely civil dispute, involving a monetary amount between two parties, had been converted into a criminal case by the Uttar Pradesh police by registering a case of cheating. Additional solicitor general K M Nataraj said police ends up getting the stick from both sides.If it does not follow the SC diktat for immediate registration of FIR on receiving a complaint disclosing an offence, it is criticised by courts, and if it registers one, it is accused of not applying its mind. The bench understood the damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't predicament of police and said, ""Registration of an FIR does not mean the person accused of the crime is required to be immediately arrested in every case. Police must apply its mind to the nature of the crime and whether it is a civil or criminal offence.""Justice Kant said, ""Such misuse of the criminal law is posing a serious threat to the legal system for dispensation of justice.People think they can use the judiciary and police as recovery agents by instituting criminal cases even when the dispute is purely civil in nature.""The bench suggested that the states could appoint a nodal officer for each district, preferably a retired district judge, who could be consulted by police whenever they have a doubt about the nature of the offence - civil or criminal - reported in the FIR. It asked the additional solicitor general to deliberate the proposal and report back to the court.In April 1 last year, the SC, in Sharif Ahmad vs UP, had ruled that ""any effort to settle civil disputes and claims which do not involve any criminal offence, by way of applying pressure through criminal prosecution, should be deprecated and discouraged."" In another case in April this year, a CJI-led bench had said, ""Converting civil cases into criminal ones by police is unacceptable. If any such incident comes to light in future, we will not hesitate to impose heavy costs on police. """,Supreme Court said threat of arrest could not be leveraged to settle such disputes.

‘Invested in real estate’: BJP shares video of Tirumala temple 'loot'; claims ‘crores of wealth’ siphoned under Jagan government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/invested-in-real-estate-bjp-shares-video-of-tirumala-temple-loot-claims-crores-of-wealth-siphoned-under-jagan-government/articleshow/124038535.cms,"Photo/Agencies

Poll Do you believe that the alleged theft from the Tirumala temple should be thoroughly investigated? Yes, it should be investigated No, it's not necessary

NEW DELHI: Andhra Pradesh’s ruling Telugu Desam Party ( TDP ) leader and MLA Nara Lokesh has alleged that over Rs 100 crore was stolen from the parakamani (donation box) of the Tirumala temple during the YSR Congress Party government led by YS Jagan Mohan Reddy.Lokesh, who is also TDP’s general secretary, shared purported CCTV footage on X on Saturday, claiming it shows large-scale misappropriation of Lord Venkateswara’s offerings.“YCP thieves have looted the sacred property of Lord Venkateswara. YCP leaders are behind the ‘hundred crore Parakamani theft’. During Jagan’s five-year rule, corruption reigned supreme. Anarchy ran rampant. Jagan turned Andhra Pradesh into a haven for thieves, looters, and mafia dons. The Jagan gang plundered mines, lands, forests, and all resources, along with exploiting the people... and in the end, they did not even spare the sacred property of Lord Venkateswara in Tirumala,” Lokesh said in his post.He also accused former Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) Chairman Bhumana Karunakar Reddy of facilitating the scam and claimed that “shares of the loot” reached Tadepalli Palace, the residence of then chief minister Jagan.TTD is the official custodian of Sri Venkateswara temple in Tirupati, the richest Hindu shrine in the world.Lokesh alleged that the stolen funds were diverted into real estate and attempts were made to “settle” the matter in a Lok Adalat. “With the backing of power, Jagan’s gang committed every possible sacrilege against Lord Venkateswara,” he added.""The sins of Jagan’s gang, the former rulers who looted the temple and its hundi, have now come to fruition. The Parakamani videos have surfaced today. Tomorrow, the accused themselves will reveal the full list of YCP’s sins,"" he further said.BJP leader Bhanuprakash Reddy also reshared the video posted by Lokesh.In 2024, the TTD had faced a separate controversy after lab reports found that the ghee used in its laddu prasadam contained adulterated animal fats.","Andhra Pradesh’s ruling Telugu Desam Party ( TDP ) leader and MLA Nara Lokesh has alleged that over Rs 100 crore was stolen from the Tirumala temple during the YSR Congress Party government.

CJM directs Kathua SSP to file FIR over alleged custodial torture of two Punjab labourers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cjm-directs-kathua-ssp-to-file-fir-over-alleged-custodial-torture-of-two-punjab-labourers/articleshow/124056308.cms,"Representative image

JAMMU: A magisterial court in Jammu’s Kathua district has directed the SSP to register an FIR in connection with the alleged custodial torture of two Punjab labourers at a police station in Basohli town.While disposing of an application filed by the aggrieved labourers, Sukar Deen and Fareed Mohammad, both residents of Chibber village in Pathankot district, chief judicial magistrate Ajay Kumar directed the SSP to entrust the investigation to an experienced and independent police officer, and submit a report to the court on the action taken within a week of receiving a copy of the order. The CJM noted that the police personnel involved appeared to have been given a clean chit after a perfunctory inquiry, “whereas investigation can be done in a case only after the registration of FIR”.The two accused were picked up from Atal Setu in Basohli on June 29 by a police team led by sub-divisional police officer (SDPO) Suresh Kumar and booked under BNS sections 132 (assaulting or using criminal force against public servants to prevent them from performing their duty), 221 (obstructing public servants in discharge of public functions) and 352 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace), among other provisions.A PIL was also filed on behalf of the duo on July 15, seeking initiation of contempt of court proceedings against 11 police personnel for their “wilful defiance” of the Supreme Court’s landmark judgment in the D K Basu & Anr vs State of West Bengal — which laid down guidelines to be followed while making arrests/detentions — aimed at curbing custodial violence.Taking a serious view of the matter, the J&K high court on July 21 issued notices to 11 police personnel, including Basohli SDPO Suresh Kumar and SHO Geetanjli."," magisterial court in Jammu’s Kathua district has directed the SSP to register an FIR in connection with the alleged custodial torture of two Punjab labourers.

NEW DELHI: The seat-sharing negotiations for upcoming assembly elections in Bihar have become more complex as two new parties - Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and Pashupati Paras's LJP faction - joined the Mahagathbandhan alliance. The situation is getting trickier as major parties are firm on their seat demands.The 243 seats will now be divided among eight parties -- Rashtriya Janata Dal, Congress, CPI, CPM, VIP, LJP (Paras) and JMM.“Two more parties are expected to be part of the INDIA bloc soon and we all have to sacrifice our share of seats to accommodate the new partners.” State Congress president Rajesh Kumar told reporters after a discussion during a key meeting of INDIA bloc leaders at the official residence of RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav.Meanwhile, Congress insist that it cannot go below the 70 seats.VIP chief Mukesh Sahani, on the other hand, has demanded “60 seats plus the post of deputy CM” while the CPI-ML is pressing for at least 40 seats, pointing to its past performance.The RJD is also unwilling to contest on fewer than 150 seats.In 2020 assembly elections, Rashtriya Janata Dal had contested on 144 seats, of which it won 75.Congress won 19 out of 70 seats.CPI-ML contested 19 seats and won 12.CPM contested 4 seats and was successful in winning 2 seats.CPI contested on 6 seats and won 2 seats.RJD's Tejashwi Yadav has already declared himself as the CM face of the opposition INDIA bloc.Addressing the rally in Ara town, the last stopover of the 'Voter Adhikar Yatra', Tejashwi questioned the Nitish Kumar government in Bihar for ""frequently copying his ideas"" and described it as a ""copycat government"". Ridiculing the government for copying his ideas, he said that at present he was moving ahead while the govt was behind him.""Tejashwi aage-aage, Sarkar pichhe-pichhe. Original CM chahiye ki duplicate?"" (Tejashwi is moving ahead while the govt is following him from behind. Do you want a duplicate CM or the original CM?), Tejashwi asked the crowd.","Two new parties - Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and Pashupati Paras's LJP faction - joined the Mahagathbandhan alliance.
