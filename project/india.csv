Congress pins hope on statehood & local connect,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-pins-hope-on-statehood-local-connect/articleshow/110189669.cms,"JHANSI : On a sweltering May evening, Congress ’s lone candidate in Bundelkhand , Pradeep Jain Aditya, embarks on a mass contact programme in Jhansi’s crowded Sadar market.Though sweating profusely and visibly tired, Jain, accompanied by the workers of SP and AAP, makes sure that he enters every single shop in the market and interacts with every trader and businessman.Despite a strong pro-Modi sentiment in the constituency, Jain commands respect for the works he has done in the past while serving as an MP.To woo voters, Jain is selling the idea of a separate state of Bundelkhand. “Congress has always believed that smaller states should exist and that is why we passed the proposal in Vidhan Sabha. However, in a federal structure, one cannot force a state govt. BJP has govts in Madhya Pradesh as well as UP but they are no longer talking about this issue which their own veterans like Rajnath Singh and Uma Bharti had flagged off a few years ago. We will try our best to ensure formation of Bundelkhand state if we form govt,” he says.Aditya Bhanu, who runs a shop in Sadar, says: “Jain still commands a lot of respect. Even in this heat, he is making sure that he meets everyone. Some traders were not in their shops when Jain visited. He made sure that he returns to meet them.”Jain’s political career started with student politics, and he went on to become Union minister for rural development in UPA govt. Before entering Lok Sabha, Jain served as MLA from Jhansi Sadar seat on two occasions. Jain’s friends from as far as Chandigarh have joined him in the campaign. For their party office, a marriage hall has been taken on rent where boards and hoardings are being put up. “Jhansi’s people are fighting this election. They want a candidate who would be there for them. I am fortunate that I never had to ask for a ticket. The alliance is working very well here. They are covering areas where I am not able to go personally,” Jain says. “The biggest issue driving the election this time is the Constitution. Ration is not as attractive a scheme as last time because people are worried that if BJP gets 400 seats, they will change the Constitution. People believe that by giving them ration, BJP wants to make them useless. Its candidates have said that the Constitution has shortcomings and that they need a majority to change it,” he claims.“Lack of jobs, for which govt is trying to compensate through schemes like free ration, is evident in cases like police constable recruitment for which 65 lakh candidates, many of them graduates and postgraduates, appeared for 51,000 seats,” Jain remarks. “There is no industry here. Nothing has come up in the recent past. The setting up of BIDA has angered many as people are not getting adequate compensation for land acquisition. BHEL is not getting work. In the coach factory inaugurated by the PM, 1,700 people had to be recruited but only 20 have been appointed,” he claims.","Pradeep Jain Aditya is Congress’s lone candidate in Bundelkhand.

"PM on his side, BJP nominee claims edge in poll",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-on-his-side-bjp-nominee-claims-edge-in-poll/articleshow/110189302.cms,"JHANSI: BJP’s Anurag Sharma , the MP from Jhansi, is facing a challenge from INDIA bloc candidate Pradeep Jain Aditya .With popularity of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on his side, and the micromanagement of elections being carried out by the party, Sharma, however, insists he has an edge over his rival.“The INDI alliance is not working in UP. This is because, of the two parties (SP & Congress), one is entirely dependent on getting votes from its very limited constituency which is caste based while the other partner has no feet on the ground.In the 2022 elections, many of their candidates lost deposits. This time just one Gandhi is contesting and he also changed his constituency, which shows that they have no faith in their own work,” said the Baidyanath scion who won the Jhansi-Lalitpur constituency seat in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. While Sharma has roped in his entire family to campaign, from his wife to his sister and daughters, the well-oiled party machinery is ensuring that every single village in the constituency is covered through music videos, pamphlets and social media outreach.Sharma is also deriving his confidence from the development of Bundelkhand, which he says has happened at breakneck speed under the Narendra Modi government.For the family, each day seems never ending, where often his wife takes over the social responsibilities when Sharma is busy elsewhere.Sharma says that this time, people are much more aware and have observed the development that has taken place. In the past five years, he said, BJP had effectively reached out to the poorest of the poor. The free ration scheme would prove to be a game changer as it had changed the lives of people, giving them more independence to go out and work.“The expectations of people have risen after they have seen things change on ground. There are a lot of aspirations in Bundelkhand which were not economically so good. A project like the Bundelkhand Industrial Development Authority will not just bring industry to the ground but also services. It was launched just 6-8 months back and we are in the process of acquiring 36,000 acres for it,” he said, adding that investors were feeling far safer in UP and many foreign companies were keen to invest here.The Har Ghar Nal scheme, a major project launched in Bundelkhand to provide tap water to every house, is a little behind schedule, says Sharma. The scheme was expected to be a major boost for the BJP govt this election, had people actually started receiving water. However, despite claims of the state govt that Bundelkhand has been covered, Sharma says that only 40% households are getting water while another 30% would start getting water in the next three months. The reason for the delay, he said, were companies going bankrupt, Bundelkhand’s terrain and that two intake wells were located in MP. “Around 90% of the pipes have been laid so we should be able to complete this very soon,” he said.","BJP’s Anurag Sharma is facing a challenge from INDIA bloc candidate Pradeep Jain Aditya.

Before 2024, you contested four elections but did not taste victory. What keeps you motivated?

What is the

election mood

in Barabanki? What dominates more – caste or

issues

?

Caste is a dominant factor in Indian elections. What is your formula?

How much leverage are you getting from alliance partner Samajwadi Party compared to the experience in 2017?

Why did you come up with a constituency-centric manifesto in addition to the Nyay Patra?

You are a few kilometers away from Ayodhya. How big a factor is Ram temple in Barabanki?

aur pet mein khana

INDIA bloc candidate from Barabanki Lok Sabha constituency ,, feels that Ram Temple is important for people, but survival comes first. In an interview with, he discussed the problems faced by the people and the poll prospects of INDIA bloc. Excerpts:You have been a chemical engineer and worked in the corporate sector before joining politics.How different are the two worlds? Don’t your friends pull you back?Everything is diametrically opposite. In the corporate sector, when you start working, there is always accountability, and you get paid for what you do. In politics, you might never get paid for your work. The level of accountability lies with everybody and still some people may remain unhappy. My friends keep calling but our chats make me realise that my life is way more happening and socially impactful than many of them.All these elections, I have been able to garner a few thousand votes which shows that there are people who have faith in me. Undeterred by the outcome, they have been with me. I may step back if I have stakes as an individual, but when you are the hope of others, you must keep going. In my constituency, 50,000-odd people have pinned their hopes on me.Issues are dominating this time because people are tired of tall claims and false promises. Youth and farmers are particularly affected. About 85% of the voters in Barabanki are directly affected by inflation in agriculture. Even those in the city are affected in one way or the other. Most farmers are engaged in growing peppermint so its cultivation and processing into oil is not getting support. After the BJP formed govt, the price of peppermint oil has never crossed Rs 1,000. It was about Rs 2,000 under previous govts. Education and employment are other key issues as many people head to Lucknow for it. Paper leaks have also made the life of youths difficult. The issue is resonating among jobseekers, especially SC and OBC candidates, who have smaller land holdings.I did take some time to accept the reality of caste, but the fact is that Congress believes in taking people from all walks of life along. Estimates show that there are 27% SCs and an equal proportion of OBCs. A connection with Dalit sub caste Pasi and OBC offshoot Kurmis is believed to be crucial for candidates here. Muslims also form a good chunk on the seat. We have been able to connect with all groups well due to combined efforts.The alliance is stronger and well taken this time. That’s mainly because we got enough time to make it work. Cooperation has trickled down from the top to the booth level. The other day, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav convened a rally which gave the final push to momentum built by SP leaders in the district, including Arvind Singh Gope and Rakesh Verma.India is extremely diverse, and each constituency has specific needs. As an aspiring public representative, it is important for me to understand the local needs and make promises that affect people’s lives. This seat needs several postgraduate colleges, better rail connectivity, peppermint oil extraction units, and link roads. That is what I have promised.The importance of Ram temple in the life of people here is high, both in social and economic context. However, people here say that ‘Ram’. This shows that survival comes before religion.","Tanuj Punia is a candidate from Barabanki Lok Sabha constituency, Uttar Pradesh.

Though it got a concrete push during the Modi govt’s first term, its implementation was approved only in 2021. The delay was due to objections raised by environmentalists concerned about the region’s natural ecosystem.The river-linking project will benefit the Bundelkhand region of both MP and UP. Once implemented, the project will provide annual irrigation to 10.6 lakh hectares of land across Chhattarpur, Tikamgarh, Panna, Sagar, Damoh and Datia districts of MP and Banda, Mahoba, Jhansi and Lalitpur districts of UP. “But when will it be completed?

I always stand with women - irrespective of which party they belong to.Secondly, AAP will discuss amid themselves and make a decision. It is up to them,"" Priyanka said when asked about the alleged assault which has put not just the AAP but also other parties of opposition's INDIA bloc on the backfoot.The opposition leaders have avoided a direct remark on the alleged assault case even as the BJP has stepped up the ante demanding action against Bibhav Kumar, who was PA to Arvind Kejriwal . Swati Maliwal, who has fought against injustice and violence against women for years, has chosen to remain silent on the issue, adding to the intrigue.The AAP has accepted that Bibhav misbehaved with Maliwal at Kejriwal's residence and has maintained that action will be taken against the former PA.Earlier today, Kejriwal did not respond to queries on the case during his joint press conference with Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav in Lucknow. When asked a pointed question during the press conference, Kejriwal was shielded by Akhilesh who said ""there are other issues that are more important than this.""The BJP has slammed Kejriwal for his silence on the issue and sought his resignation.""She is certainly the leader of the opposition party but BJP is fighting to ensure that she gets justice. In the police general diary it was mentioned that a call had been received by police and it was made through Swati Maliwal's mobile the caller mentioned that 'I am speaking from CM's residence and he made me thrashed from his PA Bibhav Kumar'. It's not important which party she belongs but she should get justice,"" said BJP national spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia.""Arvind Kejriwal should answer and if you are a coward CM and cannot speak even a single word then you should resign because the women of the country are angry and feeling insulted and only Arvind Kejriwal is responsible for this,"" he added.AAP on its part has accused the BJP of playing politics over the issue. AAP leader Sanjay Singh reminded the BJP of its actions against Maliwal when she was protesting in support of the women wrestlers in Brij Bhushan sexual harassment case.""The BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi should answer for atrocities against women during the party rule. The entire country is sad till date that wife of a Kargil veteran was paraded naked in Manipur and the PM of India remained silent. Prajwal Revanna raped thousands of women and he was allowed to flee from the country by the BJP,"" Sanjay Singh alleged.""When the female wrestlers were protesting at Jantar Mantar, Swati Maliwal went there as NCW chief, she was dragged and beaten by the police. In UP, in case of Kuldeep Singh Sengar and Hathras the PM of India has remained quite and not said a word,"" he added.On Monday morning, Maliwal had gone to the Civil Lines police station in the national capital and alleged that a member of Kejriwal's personal staff ""assaulted"" her at the chief minister's official residence. However, she did not lodge a formal complaint.Delhi Police have now initiated probe into the incident on the basis of the call record details of Maliwal's phone call to the police.

NEW DELHI: PM Modi on Thursday justified his decision not to hold press conferences by saying that the nature of media had changed and it was not the neutral entity that it used to be, with journalists promoting their views and ideologies.""I am answerable to Parliament.Today, journalists are identified with their own preferences. Media is no longer a non-partisan entity.People are now aware of your beliefs as well. Earlier, media used to be faceless... who is writing in the media, what is its ideology... nobody was bothered about it earlier. However, the situation is not the same any more,"" Modi said in an interview to Aaj Tak Hindi.The PM said a new culture had developed in politics which was centered on managing the media and not being concerned about performance. “However, I don’t believe in treading that path. I have to work hard and reach out to each household of the poor. I can also get clicked cutting ribbons in Vigyan Bhavan. However, I go to a small district in Jharkhand for a minor project. I have brought a new work culture and it is for the media to take a call whether they endorse it or not,” he said.Asked about allegations that Election Commission ’s independence had been compromised on his watch, Modi shot back by recalling instances of CECs taking to politics and holding ministerial positions after their retirement under Congress regimes and by pointing out that EC was a single-member entity for 56 years.“The funny thing is that people who came out of Election Commission sometimes became governors. Sometimes they became MPs. Sometimes they went to contest parliamentary elections against Advani ji, they are examples of people who served as chief election commissioner under previous govts. Election commissioners from that era, now retired, still tweet promoting the same political philosophy. They give their opinion and write articles. This only shows that it is only now that EC has become completely independent,” the PM said, a reference to former CEC T N Seshan contesting polls against L K Advani and M S Gill being nominated to Rajya Sabha and later becoming a Union minister under UPA regimes.In response to the opposition’s allegations that 400+ seats were meant to change the Constitution, Modi said, “Who was the first person to tamper with the Constitution in this country? It was Pandit Nehru. The amendments he brought were meant to restrict freedom of speech, which was against democracy and against the Constitution.”“After that, his daughter (Indira Gandhi) overturned a court judgment and imposed an Emergency. Rajiv Gandhi overturned Supreme Court judgment in the Shah Bano case and imposed restrictions on the media. The crown prince of Congress (Rahul Gandhi) once tore down the decision of the Union cabinet,” he said.The PM further said four different members of the same family have insulted the Constitution at different times.","PM Modi: Media is no longer a non-partisan entity.

PATNA: Home minister Amit Shah promised at a rally in Bihar Thursday that if voted to a third consecutive term in office, NDA would ban cow slaughter and ""straighten"" offenders, including those involved in cow smuggling, ""by hanging them upside down"".""Na gai ki taskari hone denge, na hatya (Won't allow smuggling of cows, nor slaughter),"" Shah declared at rallies in Madhubani and Sitamarhi.Accusing Congress and RJD chief Lalu Prasad of not doing anything for Sitamarhi's Punaura Dham, revered as birthplace of Sita, he said BJP would build a grand temple there. He said Congress and RJD were too busy protecting banned outfits like PFI, which ""wanted to make Bharat an Islamic state"", to be bothered about what the state wants.Amit Shah said Congress and Lalu’s party were too busy protecting banned organisations like PFI for them to be bothered about what the country and the state want.He asked the gathering at both rallies whether they wanted ‘viksit raj’ or ‘jungle raj’. Shah said safeguarding India-Nepal border would be among priorities of NDA govt in its third term.Echoing Modi’s remarks at a rally this week, Shah said INDIA bloc functionaries such as Farooq Abdullah of N C and Mani Shankar Aiyar of Congress reflected “meekness” of the alliance when they expressed fears about Pakistan’s nuclear capabilities if India tried to take back POK. “POK was and is ours, and we will take it back,” Shah said, adding that the country was strong enough to handle any challenge under Modi’s governance.He likened the current election to the battle of Mahabharata between Pandavas and Kauravas. He alleged that Congress-led UPA was guilty of corruption amounting to Rs 12 lakh crore, contrasting it with Modi’s stint. “Nobody can allege misappropriation of even 25 paise by Narendra Modi as both PM and previously CM of Gujarat, which is a combined period of 23 years.” He proceeded to question how Lalu and his family lived in “palatial bungalows”.“Lalu is chanting ED, ED, but Rs 350 crore in cash was seized from a Congress functionary and Rs 51 crore from a TMC minister. Cash totalling Rs 31 crore was confiscated from the residence of a Jharkhand minister. Modi govt will work to send all the corrupt behind bars and ensure that the money is returned to the poor people of the country,” he said.Highlighting BJP’s role in development of Bihar in general and Mithilanchal in particular, Shah said it was Atal Bihar Vajpayee’s govt that included Maithili in the 8th Schedule of the Constitution. “Modi govt introduced Maithili in UPSC exam (as an optional subject),” he said. “Kya Italy wale (alluding to Sonia and Rahul Gandhi) Maithili ka samman kar sakte hain (Can those from Italy give respect to Maithili)?” he said.(With inputs from CS Jha ‘Azad’ in Madhubani)","Home minister Amit Shah promised at a rally in Bihar that if voted to a third consecutive term in office, NDA would ban cow slaughter and ""straighten"" offenders.

Therefore, Congress wants to make Haryana a state from where no youth is forced to migrate from the country,” he added.Congress leader Ashok Arora and Ladwa MLA Mewa Singh also addressed the gathering and sought votes for AAP’s Sushil Gupta under the banner of INDIA alliance.","Hooda reached Ladwa in Kurukshetra while campaigning for INDI alliance candidate of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Sushil Gupta.

Man fined for not wearing helmet while driving Audi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/mad-mad-world/man-fined-for-not-wearing-helmet-while-driving-audi/articleshow/110186004.cms,"JHANSI: In a bizarre goof up by traffic police , a Jhansi man has been slapped with a fine of Rs 1,000 for not wearing a helmet while driving his Audi car .Bahadur Singh Parihar, president of a truckers’ union in Jhansi, received the fine on his mobile phone. While the photo in the challan is of a two-wheeler, the category of vehicle is mentioned as a ‘motor car’.When Parihar visited the RTO office and apprised officials about the error, he was told to wait until the Lok Sabha elections get over.Instead of contesting the challan, Parihar has opted to wear a helmet while driving the car lest RTO issues him another challan.“It is surprising how cops commit such acts despite claims of having technical surveillance systems in place. I will continue to wear the helmet till the matter gets resolved or else I may get another challan,” said Parihar.Traffic inspector in Jhansi, Umakant Ojha, said, “It seems to be a clerical error because the photo in the challan is of a man riding a bike without a helmet but the vehicle number has been wrongly mentioned.”Meanwhile, Parihar has become a centre of attraction on roads for driving his luxury car while wearing a helmet.","Bahadur Singh Parihar, president of a truckers’ union in Jhansi, received the fine on his mobile phone.
