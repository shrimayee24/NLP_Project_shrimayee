Baghel’s son laundered Rs 16.7 crore through shell firms: ED to court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/baghels-son-laundered-rs-16-7-crore-through-shell-firms-ed-to-court/articleshow/122790101.cms,"Ex-CM’s son arrested to bury the truth, crush people’s voice, says Priyanka

RAIPUR: ED informed a special court that former Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel’s son Chaitanya Baghel laundered Rs 16.7 crore through shell firms and under-invoiced real estate deals tied to a Rs 2,100 crore liquor scam. Chaitanya was arrested under Prevention of Money Laundering Act on July 18 (his 38th birthday) following searches at his home.A PMLA court in Raipur granted five days’ remand. Congress functionaries responded to this with a call for statewide “Aarthik Nakabandi” on July 22. It has planned road blockades, protests, and mineral transport disruption across Chhattisgarh. The protest aligns with the final day of Chaitanya’s ED custody and his scheduled production before a PMLA court.According to ED’s remand report, Chaitanya played a “central and active role” in laundering illegal proceeds from a liquor syndicate that allegedly manipulated Chhattisgarh’s excise system from 2019 to 2022. One transaction flagged involved Rs 5 crore funnelled from Saheli Jewellers into a project, Vitthal Green, by Baghel Developers. While project costs were officially declared as Rs 7.14 crore, ED estimates actual expenditure between Rs 13 crore and Rs 15 crore — mostly in cash.Key witness Pappu Bansal told ED that only Rs 2.62 crore was recorded in payments to the contractor, while Rs 4.2 crore was allegedly paid off the books. On Oct 19, 2020, liquor businessman Trilok Singh Dhillon allegedly paid Rs 5 crore for 19 flats in the same project under employee names.CM Vishnu Deo Sai defended ED’s actions. “ED doesn’t act randomly. It knows what it’s doing,” he said Saturday. While ex-CM Baghel accused the Centre of vendetta politics. “They raided me during Budget session. Now, after Mahant’s adjournment notice on Hasdeo forest felling, they’ve targeted my son,” he said. “I won’t break. Let them jail him — he’s strong.”Baghel alleged a “selective pattern” of enforcement: “Nothing happens to Himanta Biswa Sarma, or Suvendu Adhikari, or Ajit Pawar. Those who bow walk free.”Congress’ Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Saturday claimed that as former Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel was about to raise the issue of govt “gifting” all the state’s forests to industrialist Adani in the assembly, govt arrested his son to pressure him to bury the truth. The public has understood that these tactics under BJP are aimed at crushing the voice of people but it will not succeed, she said.“The forests are being destroyed in defiance of PESA Act and NGT directives. Baghel was going to raise the issue in the assembly. To stop him, ED raided his house early in the morning and arrested his son. In past 11 years, the country has understood well that these are methods to suppress opposition. But every Congress worker stands firmly with Baghel,” Priyanka said.","Chaitanya Baghel laundered Rs 16.7 crore through shell firms and under-invoiced real estate deals tied to a Rs 2,100 crore liquor scam.

SRINAGAR: The Jammu and Kashmir administration deployed a heavy contingent of police and paramilitary forces outside the Congress headquarters in Srinagar on Saturday, preventing a planned march demanding the restoration of full statehood.Congress’s J&K unit chief, Tariq Hameed Karra, and party general secretary G A Mir, were present at the party office to lead the march to the divisional commissioner’s office, where they intended to submit a memorandum addressed to the Prime Minister. However, police sealed the main gate and barred party workers from leaving the premises.“This is undemocratic and a sign of administrative frustration,” Karra told reporters, alleging that Congress workers from various parts of the Valley were prevented from entering Srinagar.He added that the party would intensify its campaign during the upcoming Parliament session.Mir criticised the Centre for failing to restore J&K’s statehood even ten months after an elected govt was formed. “The Centre has not moved an inch in this direction. Instead, they have complicated governance in J&K through a dual power structure,” he said.","Congress’s J&K unit chief, Tariq Hameed Karra, and party general secretary G A Mir, were present at the party office to lead the march.

Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge on Saturday accused the BJP and the RSS of wanting to rewrite India’s Constitution, asserting that no matter how hard they try, “the Constitution cannot be destroyed.”Speaking at a mega convention organised by the Karnataka government, Kharge said, “Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar is the architect of our Constitution, not Modi, not the RSS. If the Constitution is weakened, you (the BJP) will be finished. Congress has always upheld economic strength and social justice, working tirelessly from Kanyakumari to Kashmir, Assam to Gujarat.”Kharge alleged that the BJP-led Centre was “selling off” Nehru-era public sector enterprises to corporates. “The BJP is selling off factories that employed lakhs of workers to Adani and Ambani,” he said, adding that institutions like BHL and HMT were established during Nehru’s time to strengthen India’s public sector.“But what has Modi or his followers contributed to Mysuru or Karnataka? They are only visible on TV from morning to night. In the past, prime ministers were not constantly on screen, making empty speeches,” Kharge said.He accused the Modi government of ignoring the needs of states like Karnataka and Manipur. “Where is Karnataka’s GST money? The Centre returns only 4% of what we deserve,” Kharge said, slamming the BJP for “neglecting suffering states like Manipur.”Kharge also targeted BJP chief ministers, alleging that they have “no voice” under PM Modi. “In contrast, our CMs, Deputy CMs, MLAs—all engage with the people. Our party workers are on the ground, delivering guarantees and real progress,” he said.“We fulfil our guarantees, unlike the BJP, whose promises have failed in Karnataka, Telangana, and Himachal. Even Modi's visits don’t change that,” Kharge added.He said that Congress stands for development, justice, and accountability, while the BJP “only talks, sells public assets, and ignores suffering people.”","Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge accused the BJP and the RSS of wanting to rewrite India’s Constitution. “Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar is the architect of our Constitution, not Modi, not the RSS.

BENGALURU: A routine ride home from school turned into a heart-wrenching tragedy for the family of a seven-year-old boy, who died after falling out of a moving school bus due to the negligence of the driver in Magadi Friday evening.The victim is L Rajat, a class 2 student at SBS School in Magadi Town and a resident of Hosapalya in Janata Colony. He is the son of Lokesh and Radha, both daily wage workers from Hanur in Kollegal. Rajat was returning home along with his 10-year-old sister Dushita in the school bus when the incident occurred.Reconstructing the sequence of events, police the brother-sister get picked and dropped off every day by the school bus driven by 35-year-old R Vinod. ""Usually, around 30 children use the school bus. A woman attendant is appointed to look after the children during the journey. Rajat and Dushita board the bus first as the bus service starts near their house. During drop off, the brother-sister duo are the last ones to deboard,"" an investigating officer said.On Friday evening, all kids got dropped and the woman attendant got off a stop before that of Rajat and Dushita.""Vinod resumed the journey with Rajat and Dushita seated near the door. The door opened as it was not properly locked. Vinod asked Rajat to close the door. As Rajat moved closer to the door, he got thrown out of the vehicle and the rear tyre ran over him,"" police said.Vinod immediately took Rajat to a nearby private hospital, but the child succumbed to his injuries, police said. The police arrested Vinod for culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Normally, persons accused of causing accidental deaths are arrested for causing death due to negligence, and the accused person can walk out on station bail. However, when booked for culpable homicide not amounting to murder, the police have to produce the accused before the concerned court, which normally hands them over to judicial custody.""Vinod's responsibility was to ensure that the door was properly locked. He didn't check it. The second mistake was asking Rajat to close the door while the bus was moving. Vinod has been shifted to the judicial custody of Ramanagara district prison,"" an investigating officer said.","L Rajat, a class 2 student at SBS School in Magadi Town, died after falling out of a moving school bus due to the negligence of the driver.
