RANCHI: RJD is likely to settle for eight seats in the Jharkhand elections , party insiders said, though RJD reportedly held on to its initial demand of over a dozen seats at a meeting between Jharkhand CM and JMM working president Hemant Soren and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav on Monday. A senior RJD functionary said on condition of anonymity, ""JMM has offered us seven seats. We have asked for nine seats and we are hopeful that we will settle at eight.""Soren and Tejashwi met twice on Monday over seat-sharing to iron out differences.CPI-ML, also an INDIA bloc constituent, demanded at least five seats. Other Left parties, CPI and CPM, said they would fight independently after they were not invited to the talks.Tejashwi met Soren at the latter's residence along with CPI-ML leaders on Monday morning. Later in the evening, Tejashwi had a one-on-one meeting with Soren. The former Bihar deputy CM has met Hemant five times over the past four days beginning Friday. RJD has termed the JMM and Congress' decision to fight on 70 out of 81 seats and leave 11 for the rest of the bloc parties as ""unfair"" and has threatened to go solo in at least 19 seats.JMM spokesperson Vinod Kumar Pandey said, ""We are equally eager for a closure and declare our candidates at the earliest."" However, no announcement was made till late on Monday evening.Meanwhile, sources in the Congress said the party is likely to announce its candidates on Tuesday. On Monday evening, AICC convened its parliamentary board meeting to finalise names.The Jharkhand unit of Congress has virtually shifted to Delhi as several ticket claimants as well as state party office bearers have been camping in the national capital since the last couple of days amid lack of clarity over seat-sharing with alliance partners and delay in declaration of candidate list.","RJD is likely to settle for eight seats in the Jharkhand elections, party insiders said.

MVA meet today to resolve Congress-UBT rift over 15 seats,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mva-meet-today-to-resolve-congress-ubt-rift-over-15-seats/articleshow/114439029.cms,"File photo

MUMBAI: The still-unresolved row between Congress and Shiv Sena (UBT) in the Maha Vikas Aghadi is over 15 assembly seats, three of them in Mumbai and 12 in eastern Vidarbha. As both parties are claiming these seats, NCP (SP) president Sharad Pawar, UBT Sena president Uddhav Thackeray and AICC general secretary Ramesh Chennithala are set to meet on Tuesday to try and find a solution.More than a dozen meetings have been held by the MVA over seat-sharing but there is no end to the stalemate over these 15 seats, sources said.The three seats in Mumbai claimed by both Congress and UBT Sena are Byculla, Bandra East and Versova. Among the ones in Vidarbha are Ramtek, Gondia, South Nagpur, Bhandara and Gadchiroli.MPCC president Nana Patole said discussion on 96 seats allotted to Congress is complete, and Sharad Pawar and Uddhav Thackeray will meet on Tuesday for further discussions on the seat-sharing formula.According to the understanding among MVA partners, NCP (SP) is likely to contest 80 seats, while UBT Shiv Sena will contest nearly 90 and the remaining - the highest number - will be allotted to the Congress.Despite the sharp exchange of words between Patole and UBT Sena MP Sanjay Raut last week over the seats under dispute, the MPCC president on Monday claimed there are no disagreements within MVA over seat allocation.Patole said there is absolutely no substance in some reports which have said that UBT Sena is all set to quit MVA. He alleged BJP was deliberately spreading such ""rumours and misinformation"" about the opposition parties. ""The MVA is intact, there is no truth in such reports. The MVA is determined to dislodge the Mahayuti govt led by Eknath Shinde . We are sure the BJP will face a crushing defeat in the assembly elections,"" he said.","The row is over 15 assembly seats, three of them in Mumbai and 12 in Vidarbha.

MUMBAI: In the 99 seats for which BJP announced candidates on Sunday, the party took 5 seats that were contested by the undivided Shiv Sena in 2019. Political observers said this indicates that the CM Eknath Shinde-led Sena may have to compromise on seats and give up several of the seats that the Sena traditionally contested. The Nalasopara , Uran , Dhule city, Achalpur and Deoli seats were contested by Sena in 2019, but BJP has announced candidates there.In Dhule city, BJP announced the candidature of Anup Agarwal. In 2019, the Sena's Hilal Mali contested the seat but came fourth in the contest; the AIMIM's Shah Faruk Anwar won the seat. In Deoli, the Sena's Sameer Deshmukh contested but came third. BJP announced the name of Rajesh Banke from this seat. In 2019, Banke had contested as an independent and come second. In Achalpur, the Sena's Sunita Phiske contested, but she came third; Prahar Party's Bachchu Kadu won this seat. BJP has now named Pravin Tayade from this seat.In Nalasopara, in 2019, former cop Pradeep Sharma contested from Shiv Sena; he lost to the Bahujan Vikas Aghadi's (BVA) Kshitij Thakur. BJP has named Rajan Naik from this seat. From Uran, independent candidate Manohar Baldi defeated Sena's Manohar Bhoir. Baldi then extended support to BJP, and BJP has now named him as its official candidate.Even though BJP released a list of 99 seats, the Shinde Sena presented a case for getting around 100-105 seats before Union home minister Amit Shah. Eventually, Sena may get around 80-90 seats, and NCP led by Ajit Pawar may get 50-60 seats. While BJP is not too keen on giving a big chunk to NCP, political observers said NCP will not agree to anything fewer than 50-60 seats.Political observers said that in Mahayuti, a tussle is expected as the demands made by allies are more than what BJP can actually concede.","In 99 seats for which BJP announced candidates on Sunday, the party took 5 seats that were contested by the undivided Shiv Sena in 2019.

The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections , which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases. The results will be declared on November 23, along with Maharashtra.In the Tribal-dominated state, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and CM Hemant's Soren Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) are in a direct fight, while the Congress party and Lalu Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) are in alliance with the JMM.The JMM-Congress-RJD alliance are also reportedly seeking to deal with Left parties, Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party and other tribal outfits that have been contesting the elections in the state as independent entities and make efforts to field candidates against the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) on all 81 seats collectively.In the last assembly polls in 2019, the JMM-Congress-RJD alliance won a comfortable majority of 47 seats in a House of 81.The BJP slipped to 25 seats from 37 it held in 2014. The poor performance was perceived to be the outcome of its decision to contest alone backfiring. The party did not foster an alliance with the Ajsu in the 2019 polls when Raghubar Das, currently the Odisha governor, was serving the state as CM.In this year's Lok Sabha polls in Jharkhand, the BJP-led NDA secured nine out of the 14 seats, with the BJP winning eight and its alliance partner, the Ajsu (All Jharkhand Students Union) Party, retaining its single seat.On the other hand, the opposition India bloc improved its tally, increasing its seat count from two in 2019 to five in the parliamentary polls.BJP and JMM have spruced up their pace of campaigning from the ground zero to social media. BJP and JMM leaders are actively rebutting and challenging each other on a range of issues, including illegal immigration, youth welfare, employment and housing.INDIA bloc parties in Jharkhand slammed the EC for holding assembly elections in the state along with that of Maharashtra but claimed that they were ready to slug it out with BJP-led NDA, which has welcomed the announcement of poll dates.JMM, Congress, and CPI (ML-L) said the announcement showed that EC was in a hurry to conduct elections though the assembly tenure was due to end in January next year.Also, both the INDIA bloc and BJP-led NDA are expected to get into huddles to discuss the modalities of seat-sharing which is going to be a challenge for both the competing teams.","The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections, which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra. Elections in Maharashtra will be held in single phase on November 20. The counting of votes will be on November 23.Maharashtra is gearing up for elections as the two major political alliances—the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) and the Mahayuti—prepare to face each other for the first time in a Vidhan Sabha election.The Maha Vikas Aghadi, comprise of the Congress, the Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray), and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) under Sharad Pawar, will go head-to-head with the Mahayuti , which includes the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Shiv Sena faction led by Eknath Shinde, and the NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar. This will be the first electoral contest between these two alliances since the splits within the Shiv Sena and NCP.The MVA is hopeful of replicating its recent Lok Sabha success, while the Mahayuti aims to retain power by leveraging its populist schemes targeted at women and youth. Both alliances have set their sights on winning the state.Narayan Rane, a former Union Minister and the victor in the Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg Lok Sabha constituency, is poised to be a key figure for the BJP in the Konkan region during the forthcoming elections. Meanwhile, two constituencies are expected to be critical battlegrounds: chief minister Eknath Shinde's Kopri-Pachpakdi seat in Thane City and Worli in Mumbai, where Aaditya Thackeray, a leader of the Shiv Sena (UBT), is seeking reelection.In the last Vidhan Sabha elections in 2019, the BJP secured 26.1% of the votes, the Congress 16.1%, the NCP 16.9%, and the Shiv Sena 16.6%. The BJP and the Shiv Sena (then united) formed the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which secured a majority. However, the coalition soon crumbled due to disagreements over government formation, plunging the state into a political crisis.After no party could establish a government, Maharashtra was placed under President's rule. Devendra Fadnavis was briefly sworn in as chief minister, with Ajit Pawar as deputy chief minister. However, both resigned just days later before a scheduled floor test.By November 28, 2019, a new coalition emerged, with the Shiv Sena (Uddhav faction), NCP (Sharad Pawar faction), and Congress forming the Maha Vikas Aghadi government, led by Uddhav Thackeray as chief minister.The state's politics took another turn in June, 2022, when Uddhav Thackeray resigned following a rebellion within the Shiv Sena, led by Eknath Shinde, who then allied with the BJP. Eknath Shinde assumed the role of chief minister, with Devendra Fadnavis returning as deputy chief minister.",The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra. Elections in Maharashtra will be held in single phase on November 20. The counting of votes will be on November 23. This will be the first electoral contest between these two alliances since the splits within the Shiv Sena and NCP.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114248739,imgsize-47642,width-400,resizemode-4/114248739.jpg"
Baba Siddiqui: Lawrence Bishnoi’s Role Uncertain in Baba Siddique Murder: Mumbai Cops Investigate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/confusion-surrounds-lawrence-bishnois-role-in-baba-siddique-murder/articleshow/114403356.cms,"Police are grappling with conflicting theories in murder of Baba Siddiqui, after jailed gangster Lawrence Bishnoi's name surfaced in connection with crime.

MUMBAI: Police are grappling with conflicting theories in the murder of former Congress minister Baba Siddique, after jailed gangster Lawrence Bishnoi 's name surfaced in connection with the crime. Shubam Lonkar , alias Shubbu, recently claimed responsibility on behalf of Bishnoi's gang via social media, but authorities are questioning whether Bishnoi himself sanctioned the killing or if the contract was taken without his knowledge.Lawrence Bishnoi, currently lodged in Gujarat's Sabarmati jail, has not been accessible to the police, leaving investigators uncertain about his direct involvement. There is suspicion that absconding accused Shubam Lonkar, Shivkumar Gautam and Zeeshan Akhtar may have accepted the contract independently. This could be one of the many reasons why the police believe that slum rehabilitation issue could be the reason for Siddique's murder.The police are exploring this possibility as Bishnoi's gang leaders, including his brother Anmol Bishnoi and associate Rohit Godara, or Goldy Brar, who are based in Canada, have remained silent on the matter. Typically, they claim or deny involvement in the gang's activities, but their silence has raised doubts about the authenticity of Lonkar's statements.In April this year, Anmol Bishnoi took the responsibility for the firing on Salman Khan's house. He ominously hinted that next time, the bullets won't be aimed at walls or an empty home, indicating a direct threat to the actor.Another element fuelling police skepticism is Lonkar's background. He is a 12th-pass student from a Marathi school, and his limited proficiency in Hindi in Punjabi style raises questions about the authorship of his social media posts. Police suspect someone else may have written the posts and may have forwarded to Lonkar, who posted it on Facebook and later deleted it.","Lawrence Bishnoi, currently lodged in Gujarat's Sabarmati jail, has not been accessible to the police, leaving investigators uncertain about his direct involvement.
