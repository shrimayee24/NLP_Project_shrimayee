'Not the time for vulture politics ... ': Bengal minister slams opposition amid 'bribe to parents' charge against state police,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/not-the-time-for-vulture-politics-bengal-minister-slams-opposition-amid-bribe-allegations-against-state-police-in-kolkata-rape-murder-case/articleshow/113096996.cms,"NEW DELHI: The embattled Trinamool Congress government in West Bengal on Thursday asked the opposition parties in the state not to do ""vulture politics over a dead body"" like they have done several times in the past. The Mamata Banerjee government was reacting to allegations that state police tried to bribe the parents of trainee doctor, who was raped and murdered at Kolkata's RG Kar Hospital last month.It warned the opposition not to put pressure on the victim's family to take political advantage.""A lot of fake videos are circulating. Yesterday one such video went viral. We have solidarity with the victim's family and they are going through a difficult period. A video has emerged that police offered money to them to vitiate the case. Another video has emerged where the parents have called the video fake. We all want justice. We want the political parties not to extend their pressure to the family and take political advantage. We have seen the opposition parties do vulture politics over dead bodies in the past. We want to appeal to them this is not the time for such politics. We are all together in pursuit of justice,"" West Bengal minister Shashi Panja said.The family of the victim, which joined the protest at the RG Kar Hospital on Wednesday night, have accused the police of trying to offer them money when they were crying and sitting with the mortal remains of their daughter. ""When the body of the daughter was lying in front of the parents in the house, the police were offering money, is this the humanity of the police?"" the aunt of the deceased doctor had said yesterday.The Trinamool Congress, meanwhile, accused the BJP of exacerbating the distress of the victim's parents by politicising the issue. ""The BJP is not seeking justice, but only trying to use the tragedy for political gains,"" the minister said. Panja emphasised that the victim's parents are solely seeking justice, and urged that politics should not interfere with this pursuit.""When everyone is crying for justice including the Trinamool Congress, politics should not come into play. We want speedy justice and exemplary punishment for the culprit or culprits,"" Panja said, adding the CBI is currently investigating the case, and the Supreme Court has taken suo motu cognizance of the incident.The Trinamool Congress also questioned the delay in investigations on the part of CBI, which is probing the case on the instructions of Calcutta high court. West Bengal education minister and senior TMC leader Bratya Basu said despite Kolkata Police handing over all relevant documents to the CBI 23 days ago, there has been no significant progress or communication from the agency. He questioned the CBI's lack of transparency and the BJP's claims of evidence tampering.""The BJP has been saying that evidence has been tampered with. We want to know what evidence had been tampered with. Why this silence on the part of the CBI?"" he asked.The BJP, however, hit back at chief minister Mamata Banerjee and accused her police of spreading fake news. ""Earlier, Kolkata police was sending summons to the people saying that they are spreading fake news. Now, we can see that Kolkata police itself was spreading fake news regarding the renovation work that was carried out at the hospital immediately after the incident. The CM should be inquired first to get to the truth. It was an organised crime and Sandip Ghosh has big names with him,"" BJP leader Locket Chatterjee said. The party has kept the pressure on the West Bengal government and has demanded the resignation of chief minister Mamata Banerjee.(With inputs from agencies)","Trinamool Congress government in West Bengal asks opposition not to do ""vulture politics over a dead body"" Accuses BJP of exacerbating distress of victim's parents by politicising the issue.

PUNE/KOLHAPUR: Leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi on Thursday said PM Narendra Modi , besides his apology for the collapse of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj 's statue in Sindhudurg, must express regret for demonetisation , flawed GST implementation , and destroying small and medium-scale (SME) industries.He was speaking in Kadegaon in Sangli district where he unveiled the memorial and a statue of former Congress member late Patangrao Kadam. Shiv Sena UBT president Uddhav Thackeray and other senior functionaries of his party did not attend the event. Congress MLA Vishwajeet Kadam said Thackeray declined the invitation over personal work. Modi unveiled the Shivaji statue in Dec 2023 and it collapsed on Aug 26 and the PM tendered an apology during his recent visit to Maharashtra.Rahul said, ""I want to understand the reasons for his (PM's) apology. It could be because he accepts that it was a mistake to give the contract for the statue's installation to an RSS-linked person. The other reason could be that he has accepted that there was corruption in the installation. His apology to Shivaji Maharaj is not enough, he should apologise to the citizens of Maharashtra.""Rahul reiterated his accusations that the Modi-led govt helps industrialists like Adani and Ambani. ""Youth are facing unemployment crisis. The Adanis and Ambanis are not going to create employment. Small and medium-scale industries could have but Modi destroyed them to help two industrialists. He should apologise for destroying SMEs too,"" Rahul said.He added that despite opposition, Modi brought three farm laws. ""He forced demonetisation on the country. He is also responsible for the flawed implementation of GST.

SHIMLA: A large number of protesters demonstrated in Sanjauli market of Shimla Thursday, demanding demolition of a mosque that has been at the centre of a heated debate surrounding the legality of its construction and illegal immigrants allegedly staying there.""If the building is found to be illegal, action will be taken,"" PWD minister Vikramaditya Singh assured.""The presence of immigrants is a concern for the people of Himachal Pradesh .""Singh said the matter is pending before the municipal commissioner's court, with a hearing scheduled for Sept 7.The four-hour demonstration saw participation from residents, BJP workers, and members of several organisations, who shouted slogans against the alleged illegal mosque .

"After Ganderbal, Omar Abdullah files nomination from Budgam",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-ganderbal-omar-abdullah-files-nomination-from-budgam/articleshow/113104303.cms,"SRINAGAR: National Conference ( NC ) vice president Omar Abdullah submitted Thursday his nomination papers from Budgam in central Kashmir, choosing to contest from two constituencies in the J&K assembly elections . The day before, he had filed his papers for the family stronghold of Ganderbal , where the race intensified with some contestants apparently complicating matters for Omar.Both constituencies will vote in the second phase of the three-leg elections on Sept 25.As an explanation for contesting from a second constituency, Omar said: “The contest from Budgam shows NC is not weak. It is proof of our power. Had there been any risk in fighting polls from Budgam, my party colleagues would not have recommended me to contest. There is a wave for NC in every nook and cranny of J&K.”He predicted that NC and alliance partner Congress would be voted to office. The new assembly would make the world aware of “decisions taken against J&K and its people in the past five years”, the former CM said.Omar’s decision drew criticism from political opponents. “If Omar Abdullah truly believes the people are with him, he would not have felt the need to contest from two constituencies. His decision shows a clear lack of confidence,” PDP’s Ghulam Nabi Lone said.According to sources, at least three factors might have influenced Omar’s decision. “In Ganderbal, Omar is facing dissent from a section of NC workers seeking a local candidate. He also faces a tough, multi-pronged fight in Ganderbal. His prospects appear better in Budgam, where he led in votes during his Lok Sabha defeat to independent candidate Engineer Rashid,” said a source.Baramulla MP Rashid’s Awami Ittehad Party has fielded former Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industries president Sheikh Ashiq as an independent candidate in Ganderbal. Former CM Mehbooba Mufti’s PDP has nominated Bashir Ahmad Mir.Adding to the competition is jailed separatist cleric Sarjan Ahmad Barkati, who had his nomination papers for Zainapora in south Kashmir rejected. Barkati has now opted to contest from Ganderbal, traditionally an NC bastion. The Abdullah family has represented Ganderbal since 1977, beginning with party founder Sheikh Abdullah , followed by his son Farooq Abdullah, and later Omar, who won the seat in 2008 after losing it in 2002.Omar has faced criticism for participating in the elections after earlier announcing that he would abstain until J&K’s full statehood was restored. He later admitted: “Staying out of the elections was a mistake. Seeking votes from the people while not being a candidate myself seemed contradictory.”These elections will be the first since the 2019 abrogation of Article 370 and bifurcation of the region into two Union territories, including Ladakh. The NC-Congress campaign focuses on the restoration of J&K’s statehood — a demand that resonates across both Kashmir and Jammu.","National Conference ( NC ) vice president Omar Abdullah submitted his nomination papers from Budgam in central Kashmir.

This shift signals a trend toward mainstream political participation, departing from past separatist boycotts.The NC-Congress alliance is contesting 83 out of 90 seats, leaving five for “friendly contests.” NC will contest 51, Congress 32, and one seat each has been allocated to allies CPM and J&K National Panthers Party.Peoples Conference chief Sajad Lone, another key regional player, released Thursday his party’s election manifesto, aligning with NC and Congress on the promise to fight for the restoration of J&K’s statehood.Lone also pledged to establish a judicial commission to investigate the alleged rigging of the 1987 assembly elections, which is believed to have triggered the insurgency in the region.

Fresh start halted in its tracks: Unnao survivor faces eviction as rent stops,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/unnao-survivor-faceseviction-as-rent-stops/articleshow/113074184.cms,"Fresh start for Unnao rape survivor halted in its tracks

NEW DELHI: The survivor in the 2017 Unnao rape case, who had moved to the capital a few years ago, is on the verge of losing her accommodation because since July, the Delhi government has not paid rent . This amount is reimbursed by the Uttar Pradesh government.The 23-year-old survivor, who is married and seven-months pregnant with her second child, says her landlord has been threatening to cut off power, and evict her.The woman was gang-raped on June 4, 2017, in Unnao when she was 16. On Dec 16, 2019, former BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar was convicted of the crime and on Dec 20, sentenced to life imprisonment. He was also found guilty in the case of her father's death in judicial custody.Citing police inaction in the rape case and her father being arrested on false charges, the survivor had attempted to immolate herself at the residence of chief minister Yogi Adityanath on April 8, 2018.At her one-room house in south-west Delhi, she told TOI that she had moved to the capital in 2017 as she sensed a threat to her life in UP. After the car she was travelling in met with an accident on July 28, 2019 — her two aunts were killed and a lawyer severely injured — Supreme Court provided CRPF security to her and her family.The top court had also transferred all five cases registered in connection with the rape from a Lucknow court to one in Delhi with directions to hold the trial on a daily basis and complete it within 45 days. Delhi high court had in September 2019 directed Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) to assist the survivor and her family in getting accommodation in the capital.“I was first provided accommodation with my mother in Nangloi following the court’s direction. However, last year, I decided to make a fresh start. On May 29, 2023, I got married and took the court’s permission to live separately,” she said.Following an appeal by her, Delhi high court, in November 2023, directed DCW to provide separate accommodation to her considering her marriage and birth of her first child, a girl. The high court had said that the accommodation would not be taken away without its order.For the past year, the survivor has been living at her current residence with her husband and child. Adjacent to her house is another one room tenement where the CRPF personnel guarding her stay. The rent and electricity charges for both rooms are to be paid by DCW.Speaking to TOI on condition of anonymity, a member of the commission explained, “DCW takes the funds from Delhi’s department of women and child development (WCD) to pay the rent and electricity bill for both houses. That amount is later reimbursed by the UP govt . But, only when WCD gives the funds to DCW can they pay up.”TOI reached out to WCD, DCW and AAP govt to find out the reason for the payments being stopped but there was no response.The survivor said she has knocked on the doors of DCW and WCD multiple times, asking them to settle the dues but to no avail. “Currently, the bail plea of Kuldeep Singh Sengar is being heard. I still have to go to court at least five times a month. So, I can’t leave Delhi. I am afraid that if he gets bail, my family will be in danger. So, I make it a point to attend all the proceedings. But now I am scared that I may lose this house. My husband has a meagre income and that won’t be enough for us to stay in the city,” said the survivor.The rent and the electricity bill amount are paid directly to the owner of the house. He told TOI that even in the past, the payment was irregular, but it has stopped since July. “I have been paying the electricity bill from my own pocket for the past few months,” he said.The survivor also lamented that despite the court’s order to provide her with skill training, no proper efforts have been made. Showing the applications written to DCW, she said, “I was uneducated when the incident happened. I realised that only if I get a formal education can I have a job and a better life ahead.”She showed her National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) degree that she has received for class Xth and XIIth. “I have written to DCW multiple times to help me with English or computer coaching but nothing has been done. Isn’t it the authorities’ responsibility to provide a rape survivor a better life? Am Iasking for too much?” she said.","The survivor in the 2017 Unnao rape case, who had moved to the capital a few years ago, is on the verge of losing her accommodation.
