Despite opposition’s outcry over unemployment, inflation, and concerns regarding changing of the Constitution, what are the factors that appear to be working for BJP?

How do you assess the political landscape in Bihar, Odisha, West Bengal, and Maharashtra?

What do you think about Uttar Pradesh’s role in Lok Sabha polls?

Agreeing with most exit polls predictions, political strategisthas predicted an impressive 350-plus seats for the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the Lok Sabha elections . Talking to, he said that PM Narendra Modi ’s popularity and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath ’s efforts during the campaign would ensure BJP ’s success in UP . Excerpts:The pivotal factor in this election, since the announcement of polling dates by the Election Commission, was the absence of a credible candidate for the Prime Minister’s post among the 26 constituents of the INDIA bloc. This apparently resonated across the nation and the people started rallying behind the strong leadership of Narendra Modi. Moreover, the Modi-Yogi factor transcends regional boundaries to a pivotal role in BJP’s campaign. Modi’s global image is an added advantage to the party. This election marked a departure from traditional narratives, with even issues like the Ram Mandir failing to sway voter sentiment.BJP is likely to emerge successful in South India , particularly in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. The party’s consistent performance in Karnataka, and swift rise in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, can be attributed to Narendra Modi’s stature. South Indian youths perceive Modi as a national leader and reject divisive politics of the Congress and regional parties.Issues like unemployment and inflation, which form the crux of opposition rhetoric, are far from ground reality. People are demanding reforms, and the Modi govt’s focus on facilitating entrepreneurship through initiatives like startup promotion has resonated with middle and upper-class youth. A large number of youths no longer aspire for govt jobs but seek avenues for entrepreneurship.In Bihar, Tejashwi Yadav’s emergence may alter the state’s political dynamics in the upcoming assembly elections. The BJP needs to strategize accordingly to counter his influence. In Odisha and West Bengal, desire for change is palpable due to stagnation and corruption. Maharashtra is likely to witness minimal impact from intra-state party divisions on BJP’s vote share.The towering presence of PM Narendra Modi and effective governance of CM Yogi has been attracting voters across the state. BJP’s focus on development initiatives, infrastructure, welfare schemes, and reforms, appeals to broad spectrum of voters. These initiatives aimed at improving socio-economic landscape and enhancing the quality of life of the people. Alliance with regional parties and community leaders would help BJP consolidate its position in key constituencies. BJP’s ground-level machinery, dedicated workers and volunteers have made BJP poll prospects bright.",Political strategist Vimal Singh predicts 350-plus seats for the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the Lok Sabha elections.

"Bigwigs led poll blitzkrieg in UP, PM Modi covered 70 seats",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bigwigs-led-poll-blitzkrieg-in-up-pm-modi-covered-70-seats/articleshow/110631710.cms,"Arunachal Pradesh Sikkim Arunachal Pradesh Seats: 60 L + W Majority: 31 BJP 19 NPP 1 CONG 0 OTH 0 Sikkim Seats: 32 L + W Majority: 17 SKM 5 BJP 1 SDF 1 CONG 0 OTH 0 Source: Pvalue

If Lok Sabha elections were all about campaign blitzkrieg , then political bigwigs across party lines knew no limits – at least in politically crucial Uttar Pradesh For BJP, PM Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah led from the front and addressed 24 and 30 public rallies , respectively, in the last one-and-a-half months of the hectic and high-stake elections. At times, Modi and Shah addressed three to four rallies in a day.The political stir evoked by Modi and Shah was further amplified by CM Yogi Adityanath who, according to the UP BJP unit, turned up in all 80 Lok Sabha seats to address rallies at least twice within a space of around 2 months. He often accompanied PM Modi in some of his rallies. In all, Yogi attended 204 election-related events in 61 days of his campaigning for the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.Modi, like in 2014 and 2019, started his poll campaign in UP by addressing a rally in Meerut, which went to the polls in the second phase. In all, the PM traversed through the state to cover as many as 70 Lok Sabha seats.Besides public rallies, PM Modi also held as many as five road shows in Varanasi, Ayodhya, Kanpur, Ghaziabad and Bareilly. The road shows were strategically planned and aimed to touch at least five organisational regions, including West UP, Braj, Awadh, Kanpur-Bundelkhand and Kashi. Modi’s road shows in Varanasi and Ayodhya were categorically perceived to sharpen BJP’s religious-cultural narrative, especially after the inauguration of Ram temple in Ayodhya.Shah, too, led two road shows – one in Amethi and the other in Ghazipur. Both these road shows, too, were part of BJP’s deft planning to ratchet up the poll fervour in the two constituencies which the BJP seeks to win desperately. Shah also worked behind the curtains while holding key organisational meetings after each phase.Likewise, for the INDIA bloc, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav addressed nearly 83 solo public rallies besides five joint rallies with former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi and six road shows. Akhilesh criss-crossed the state by air as well as in his customised ‘rath’ to meet his party supporters. In between, he held meetings with his party leaders – both sitting and ex-MLAs – seeking ground-level feedback.Even his wife and Mainpuri MP Dimple Yadav campaigned hectically till Thursday. Their eldest daughter Aditi, too, joined her parents in reaching out to the voters. Just like those of BJP, the rallies of Akhilesh, too, drew huge crowds. However, in some of his rallies, like the one in Prayagraj, supporters turned unruly and rushed to the dais.Separately, Rahul addressed 10 rallies, including the ones in Rae Bareli, from where he contested, Amroha, Kannauj, Kanpur, Lucknow, Amethi, Prayagraj, Bansgaon and Varanasi. His sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, too, addressed public meetings in Amethi, Rae Bareli and Gorakhpur, besides four nukkad sabhas and five road shows. BSP chief Mayawati addressed around 28 public meetings which had a significant turnout. Her nephew and former national coordinator Akash Anand, too, addressed at least a dozen public meetings to garner support for the party.","PM Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah addressed 24 and 30 public rallies, respectively, in the last one-and-a-half months of the hectic and high-stake elections.

Through the campaign, they only enhanced their expertise on one thing — Modi bashing. Such regressive politics has been rejected by the people,” he added.Modi praised Election Commission for its “exemplary” efforts at ensuring a smooth and fair electoral process. “Their dedication and meticulous planning have been crucial in upholding the integrity of our democracy , allowing citizens across the nation to vote with confidence and security. Our electoral process is something every believer in democratic values takes inspiration from,” the PM said, a remark which coincided with deaths of polling personnel due to the intense heat wave and contrasted with the condemnation of the poll body by opposition parties.He also expressed gratitude to security forces for their unwavering vigilance during the elections “I can say with confidence that the people of India have voted in record numbers to re-elect the NDA government. They have seen our track record and the manner in which our work has brought about a qualitative change in the lives of the poor, marginalised and downtrodden,” Modi said in a series of posts on X.“At the same time, they have seen how reforms have propelled India to being the fifth largest global economy. Every scheme of ours has reached the intended beneficiaries without any bias or leakage,"" he further said.Extending gratitude to voters , the PM said their active participation was the cornerstone of the country's democracy. Making special mention of women and youth, he said, “I would also like to specially appreciate India’s Nari Shakti and Yuva Shakti . Their strong presence at the polls is a very encouraging sign.”He also applauded NDA workers, saying that across the length and breadth of India, they often braved intense heat. “I compliment them for meticulously explaining our development agenda to the people and motivating them to come out and vote. Our karyakartas are our greatest strength,” PM Modi said.","The opposition alliance failed to strike a chord with people because they are “casteist, communal and corrupt”, the PM wrote on X soon after voting for the last phase got over. “This alliance, aimed to protect a handful of dynasties, failed to present a futuristic vision for the nation,” he added.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110631148,imgsize-32184,width-400,resizemode-4/110631148.jpg"

TASHIGANG : Prem Lal arrived early at the sub-divisional magistrate's office last Thursday, the icy cold and crisp morning air hinting at the challenges ahead. As one of the 29 booth-level officers deployed from Kaza to polling stations in Lahaul-Spiti district of Himachal Pradesh , Lal knew the next few days would be demanding. Wearing sunglasses to shield his eyes from the glaring sun, the teacher joined others in a semi-circle. The SDM, carrying a bunch of papers, called out the names of the poll-booth officers and their assignments.It was Tashigang for Lal and his team of five others. Tashigang is a tiny village perched high in the icy Himalayas at a staggering altitude of 15,256 feet. The village holds the distinction of hosting the highest polling station in the world.Located near the India-China border, Spiti Valley is part of the Mandi Lok Sabha seat, one of the four parliamentary constituencies in Himachal Pradesh and second largest in India.The polling station at Tashigang served 62 voters from Tashigang and Gete. The hour-and-a-half-long journey to Tashigang, located on the other side of a mountain facing the SDM's office in Kaza, was as formidable as the landscape itself - rugged terrain, narrow winding dirt roads and unpredictable weather.Yet, for Lal and his team, the assignment carried a sense of purpose. In a place where the harsh environment shapes every aspect of life, facilitating the democratic process was both a ""duty and an honour"".On voting day on Saturday, the polling team and voters donned traditional Chuba attire. A lunch was organised for voters. They took selfies at a selfie point set up against the backdrop of brown hills and a bright blue sky. ""My vote, my right,"" it said, capturing the spirit of democracy in this remote corner.","Tashigang is a tiny village perched high in the icy Himalayas at a staggering altitude of 15,256 feet.

All done: 62% turnout in Phase 7 against 65.3% in 2019,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/all-done-62-turnout-in-phase-7-against-65-3-in-2019/articleshow/110630287.cms,"NEW DELHI: The curtains came down on the mammoth general election exercise on Saturday, with the seventh and last phase of polling — covering 57 parliamentary constituencies across eight states and 42 assembly seats in Odisha — recording nearly 62% turnout until 11.50pm in the face of soaring temperatures in many parts of the polling states.The turnout, which is lower than the polling in each of the earlier six phases, is provisional and will inch up as more polling parties return and file their reports. All the polling figures constantly updated by EC via its voter turnout app are based on EVM votes; postal ballots are counted only on results day.The all-India polling percentage in the 2024 Lok Sabha poll can be known only after Form 17C data is finalised for Phase 7. However, the turnout for the first six phases — covering 485 seats excluding Surat that did not see a contest — works out to 66%.The all-India turnout in the 2019 general election — for all 543 seats and inclusive of postal ballot votes — was 67.4%.EC on Saturday released a statement thanking all stakeholders for braving tough weather and logistical challenges and helping maintain law and order so as to make the 2024 general election a “grand success”. “The collective efforts of voters, political parties, candidates, election personnel and security forces during polling have strengthened Indian democracy , deserving great respect and appreciation. We, the people, have kept the wheels of democracy spinning,” said anEC spokesperson on behalf of chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar and election commissioners Gyanesh Kumar and Sukhbir Singh Sandhu.Notwithstanding the criticism directed at it for being soft towards the party in office, particularly while reviewing MCC complaints against the prime minister, EC thanked all parties and candidates, calling them a “critical pivot of Indian elections”.Among states that voted on Saturday, West Bengal maintained its high-turnout streak with 73.4%polling. However, the state witnessed disruptions: a local mob looted EVMs from a polling station in Jaynagar (SC) parliamentary constituency and threw a control unit and two ballot units of EVMs, along with two VVPAT machines, in a pond. An FIR was registered and fresh papers and EVM were provided to the sector officer, enabling uninterrupted polling.Jharkhand and Odisha also fared well on the polling meter , both logging turnout of 70.7%. Himachal Pradesh witnessed a turnout of 69.8%, followed by Chandigarh with 67.9%.Uttar Pradesh and Bihar continued to report moderate turnouts at 55.6% and 51.6% respectively. Varanasi, from where PM Narendra Modi is seeking re-election, polled 56.3% votes. Ghazipur witnessed a turnout of 55.2% and Gorakhpur 54.7%. Salempur saw the least polling in the state at 51.3%.Punjab — which is witnessing a three-cornered fight among Congress, AAP and BJP — saw a moderate 59.5% turnout, way less than the 65.9% polling it had seen in 2019. Constituencies like Amritsar, Ludhiana and Hoshiarpur, in particular, witnessed low voter interest .The total electorate in the current poll was 97.6 crore, of which 57.8 crore had voted until Phase 6. Even if 62% of the electorate in 57 remaining seats have voted in Phase 7, the absolute number of votes polled would have crossed 64 crore, up from 61.4 crore who voted in 2019.In terms of gender-wise voting, turnout among women exceeded the male polling percentage in two of the last six phases, as it did in 173 of the 486 parliamentary constituencies where polling was completed by Phase 6.","The turnout is lower than the polling in each of the earlier six phases.

Law on exit polls

NEW DELHI: After voting in the final phase, the much-anticipated exit poll results for Lok Sabha elections 2024 will be announced today at 6.30pm. The exit poll results will be announced 30 minutes after the polling ends. These polls, conducted immediately after the conclusion of voting in parliamentary or assembly elections, provide valuable insights into the potential outcomes. Political analysts and psephologists diligently examine the data to forecast which party might hold an advantage in the election.Read More: Lok Sabha Election 2024 As the exit poll results show the trends for the final results to be announced on June 4, here's a look at how the exit poll predictions have fared in the last two Lok Sabha elections of 2014 and 2019.The 2024 Lok Sabha elections have shaped up to be a fierce battle between two major alliances: the BJP-led NDA and the Congress-led INDIA bloc. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's NDA alliance is determined to secure a third consecutive term in power, while the INDIA bloc is working tirelessly to orchestrate an upset victory. The outcome of this high-stakes election will have far-reaching implications for the nation's political landscape.Exit polls have had a mixed track record in capturing the electoral outcomes in India. The 2014 polls were largely successful in gauging public sentiment, correctly forecasting a robust showing by the BJP-led NDA, which secured a majority with 282 seats.However, the 2009 and 2004 elections saw significant discrepancies between exit poll predictions and actual results.In 2009, the UPA surpassed exit poll projections, winning 262 seats, well above the highest forecast of 205. The 2004 polls also missed the mark, failing to anticipate the NDA's defeat at the hands of the UPA.As the nation awaits the 2024 exit poll findings, their precision and alignment with the final tallies will inevitably take centre stage in political discussions and evaluations.Exit polls serve as a tool to measure public opinion, but their precision depends on various elements such as the number of participants, the areas surveyed, and the willingness of voters to be forthright. Although analyzing voting trends within specific groups can provide insights, the possibility of voters not disclosing their genuine choices can result in potential discrepancies.Over time, exit polls have demonstrated mixed levels of reliability, with some instances of accuracy and others of inaccuracy.The effectiveness of exit polls relies heavily on the methodology employed.In past elections, exit polls have had a checkered record of predicting results. Some have been successful in providing a close approximation of the final tally, while others have significantly missed the mark. This inconsistency underscores the challenges inherent in relying solely on exit polls as a predictive tool.According to Section 126A of the Representation of the People's Act, 1951, it is illegal for news channels and pollsters to disclose exit poll results before the completion of the last phase of voting. Breaking this rule could lead to a maximum prison sentence of two years, a monetary penalty, or both.Releasing exit poll numbers prematurely is strictly prohibited by law. The legislation aims to ensure that the voting process remains unbiased and uninfluenced by early predictions or projections. The consequences for breaching this regulation are severe, emphasizing the importance of maintaining the integrity of the electoral process.",The 2024 Lok Sabha elections' exit polls offer insights into potential outcomes.

Difference between opinion poll and exit poll

When will the exit poll be declared?

NEW DELHI: The assembly elections in four states- Arunachal Pradesh Sikkim , Odisha , and Andhra Pradesh were concluded along with the Lok Sabha elections and now all have turned their attention to exit poll predictions which will be released on Saturday evening.Researchers conduct exit polls by asking questions from voters immediately after they have cast their ballots at the polling station. The purpose of these polls is to forecast the outcome of the election using the data gathered from voters on the day of the election itself.Exit polls serve as a tool to gauge the sentiment of the electorate and provide an early indication of the likely winners and losers. However, the accuracy of exit polls has been a subject of debate, as they have been known to miss the mark in some instances.Exit polls in India have a long history, with the Delhi-based Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) being the pioneer in developing indigenous exit polls in the 1960s. However, it wasn't until the 1980s that media poll surveys became prominent.During this period, psephologist Prannoy Roy collaborated with David Butler to conduct in-depth studies on Indian elections. Their research and findings were compiled into the influential book ""The Compendium of Indian Elections,"" co-authored by Prannoy Roy, David Butler, and Ashok Lahiri. This publication marked a significant milestone in the analysis and understanding of electoral trends in India.Opinion polls are surveys which are carried out to find the voter sentiment regardless if they wish to vote or not, prior to the actual voting process. However, exit polls are performed immediately after individuals have exercised their right to vote on the designated election day.The exit poll of Assembly elections in Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha will be announced on Saturday, after 6:00 pm.The assembly elections in Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim were held on April 19 in first phase while assembly polls in Andhra Pradesh were held in the fourth phase on May 13. Meanwhile, Odisha assembly elections were held in four phases from May 13 to June 1.The results for the Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim assembly elections will be declared on June 2 while results for Odisha and Andhra Pradesh will be announced on June 4.","The exit poll of Assembly elections in Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha will be announced on Saturday, after 6:00 pm.

LUCKNOW: With the marathon poll battle reaching its seventh and last round, polling will be held in its south-eastern region dominated by OBCs, Dalits and, of course, the Modi-Yogi factor. Hectic political activities worthy of a high-voltage contest are being witnessed in the run-up to the V-day. BJP ’s ‘Chanakya’ Amit Shah managed to win over two key leaders from Ballia, former minister Narad Rai and Ram Iqbal Singh, to make things easier for BJP’s candidate Neeraj Shekhar. The 13 seats going to the polls broadly come under the areas of influence of PM Narendra Modi and CM Yogi Adityanath.Most of these seats have the dominance of OBCs – Yadavs, Kurmis, Nishads, Kushwahas, Rajbhars, Nonias – Brahmins, Thakurs and Bhumihars are also in large numbers. In fact, this is the only region out of seven where Bhumihar votes play a role and send people’s representatives of their caste. To understand the pattern of this phase, one must understand the voting patterns seen in the past six phases.About two hours after phase 3 polling came to an end on May 7, in a surprise move, BSP chiefMayawati removed her nephew Akash Anand from the position of national coordinator and her political successor, barely five months after she had appointed him.According to political observers, the decision was not formed by Akash’s speeches which led to FIRs, but voting trend in the phase 3 which showed that a fraction of BSP’s core voters, Jatavs, were getting vocal about their ‘disillusionment’ with the party leadership and seen drifting away. While non-Jatavs have historically shifted towards BJP, this time, as a new trend, a few Jatavs were seen moving towards SP-Cong alliance as well. “That was the time when BSP chief Mayawatidecided to go for a safety and damage control exercise,” says a highly placed source.According to observers by removing Akash, BSP chief Mayawati wanted to save her nephew from failed launching as a section might begin associating his launching with the shift in Jatav votes -- though it thinned as election moved towards east. The phenomenon of the division in Jatav voters may come as an eye-opener for the BSP, which has remained complacent elections after elections for the past around three decades ever since Kanshi Ram began expanding the BSP by mainly wooing the Dalits.“There was a time when we all were steadily behind BSP,” says Mahesh Prasad of Batrauli in Kushinagar. However, in this election we will certainly look at the winnability of the candidates more than anything else, Prasad further says. Why to waste our vote just to prove loyalty when a BSP candidate is unable to throw a fight, questions Ram Bhor, a native of Kashipur village in Deoria.Observers see two main reasons behind the shift towards the Cong-SP alliance even though it may not be substantial. First, ever since the 2017 Assembly polls, Mayawati has failed to present a strong force in the state and even created a perception among the masses of not contesting the polls too strongly. Secondly, a section of Dalits,which had been traditionally with Congress before the ’90s when the BSP emerged as their last resort, saw some value in INDIA bloc narrative that if BJP comes to power with huge numbers it will remove their reservation and change the Constitution.However, the big question is whether the Congress-SP will be able to capitalise on this gain or whether BSP chief will rework on the strategy to regain the lost confidence of Jatavs on her and also counter yet another political threat rising slowly yet steadily from this poll onwards – Azad Party chief Chandrashekhar Azad.This drifting of Dalits and lack of ‘formidable’ BSP candidates has turned the contest bipolar on majority of seats, including 13 going to the polls. Varanasi, Gorakhpur, Ballia, Chandauli, Ghazipur, Ghosi, Kushinagar, Salempur all are witnessing a direct fight between BJP and INDIA bloc candidates. “It would mean that the winners will have to manage over 45-46% votes. A large number of BJP candidates had won by a large margin in 2019. Although INDIA bloc is getting a new set of voters, it will need to really jack up its tally of votes to bridge that gap,” says a political analyst.Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav has invested some thoughts in distributing tickets, even if that meant replacing the candidates several times. “He fielded just five Yadav candidates and four Muslims to avoid the tag of an M-Y party. It was also a bid to avoid any counter-polarisation against the party,” says a UP watcher, adding “he also kept caste equations in mind while deciding the names of candidates.”“He has fielded Rajiv Rai in Ghosi keeping in mind a large number of Bhumihars in the constituency,” he says, “this is the seat which belonged to Kalpnath Rai.” Similarly, constituencies like Kushinagar (Pintu Sainthwar), Ballia (Sanatan Pandey), Chandauli (Virendra Singh), Mirzapur (Ramesh Chand Bind) are examples of smart ticketing, keeping local caste considerations,” he adds.There are two sets of silent voters who are generally out of pollsters’ radar – women, especially the rural women, and beneficiaries. These voters which were neither heard of nor talked about earlier, seem to have not only gained prominence but also are gradually forming a strong and stable voter base. The more the rural women have been empowered even at home with facilities like toilets, Ujjwala scheme and an affordable house for the family, free ration, and improvement in law-and-order situation, the more they are becoming vocal and independent with their opinions.“Isme toh koi sandeh nahin hai ki Yogi raj mein koi darr nahi lagta hai kahin bahar jaane mein (There is no doubt that women are not scared of going out in Yogi govt),” Chanda Devi, a former pradhan at Rampurka Lal village in Deoria, says, giving a hint of her voting preference. Some 250 km away from Deoria, the voices in Basti are no different when it comes to getting the benefits of govt schemes. At Nathanpur village, around two kilometres off the Barabanki-Bahraich highway is Meera Devi (name changed) running a grocery shop to earn the living for her two children. “There is no doubt that fear among the women has come down in the past over six years,” she says, and adds that things need to further improve to give a free and fair society to the women.Although Ram Mandir is not being talked about, there is a huge chunk of voters who are keeping construction of temples at Ayodhya in mind. Lastly, the anti-incumbency against candidates at several places has only made BJP think-tank and workers toil harder than ever before.","Polling will be held in south-eastern region dominated by OBCs, Dalits and, of course, the Modi-Yogi factor. The 13 seats going to the polls broadly come under the areas of influence of PM Narendra Modi and CM Yogi Adityanath.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110614394,imgsize-835380,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/110614394.jpg"

'India has voted': PM Modi

Dance of Democracy

NEW DELHI: The Lok Sabha exit polls released on Saturday predicted that the BJP-led NDA will not only win a third term but may better its 2019 results of 353 seats.Besides securing an unprecedented third term, the BJP-led NDA had also set a target of clinching more than 400 seats with the saffron party alone eyeing over 370 seats. According to pollsters, the '400 paar' target may not be achieved. According to poll of polls so far, the NDA is expected to win around 370 seats.Only 3 pollsters: Axis My India, CNX and Today's Chanakya gave an upper limit of 400-401 seats to the NDA.In 2019, the BJP had won 303 seats on its own while its NDA partners added another 50 to the tally.The opposition parties under the INDIA bloc also carried out a strong campaign, attacking the ruling BJP over several key issues such as unemployment and inflation. It remains to be seen whether the Congress can better its 2019 results when it won just 52 seats, but exit polls predicted that the INDIA bloc will win roughly 140 seats.As the exit polls were being announced, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a series of tweets: ""India has voted! A heartfelt thank you to all those who exercised their franchise ... The opportunistic INDI Alliance failed to strike a chord with the voters. They are casteist, communal and corrupt. ""The 2024 Lok Sabha polls were held in 7 phases from April 19 to June 1.Some states like Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Bihar saw polling across all 7 phases while states like Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Himachal and Punjab saw single-phase voting.Overall voter turnout in all the phases was marginally lower compared to the 2019 polls and a row had erupted over the Election Commission revising voter turnout data days after conclusion of a phase. The poll panel however refuted all allegations.The 44-day-long election saw hectic, high-octane, and often crude campaigning.Prime Minister Narendra Modi set off on a whirlwind tour of the country ahead of the elections. He conducted multiple rallies almost every day, sometimes across several states. He also gave interviews to most of the major news channels. Before the start of the last phase, PM Modi went on a 45-hour meditation at the Vivekananda Rock Memorial in Kanniyakumari.","The BJP-led NDA had set a target of clinching more than 400 seats.

HYDERABAD: Hyderabad will cease to be the official joint capital of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh from Sunday. Section 5(1) of AP Reorganisation Act, 2014, said: ""On and from the appointed day, i.e June 2, Hyderabad in the existing state of Andhra Pradesh shall be the common capital of the state of Telangana and the state of Andhra for such period not exceeding 10 years.""Section 5(2) said after expiry of the period, Hyderabad would be the capital of Telangana only and there would be a new capital for Andhra Pradesh.Andhra Pradesh has no permanent capital yet with the fight over Amaravati and Visakhapatnam still raging in courts. Incumbent Andhra chief minister Jagan Mohan Reddy has said that if he retains power, Visakhapatnam will be the administrative capital while Amravati will be the seat of legislature and Kurnool will be the judicial capital.For the record, AP had stopped using Hyderabad as capital soon after bifurcation in 2014 and only kept some buildings in the city. The latest separation between the two Telugu states will be symbolic but is an important milestone all the same, a political observer said.","Hyderabad will cease to be the official joint capital of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh from Sunday.

:

Hat-trick for PM Modi, NDA

INDIA bloc fails to impress

BJP makes inroads in South

Big setback for Mamata's TMC

Voters say no to Kejriwal-Rahul

BJP supremacy continues in Hindi heartland

BJP dominates Naveen Patnaik's bastion

NEW DELHI: The much-anticipated exit polls for Lok Sabha elections 2024 are in and as if the predictions are correct, Narendra Modi is all set to take oath as prime minister for the third time. At the same time, three pollsters have also predicted the 'abki baar 400 paar' target turning into reality on June 4. On the other hand, the opposition INDIA bloc which came together to fight against the BJP, seems to have failed in impressing the voters, as per exit poll predictions.The exit polls have predicted historic third term for PM Modi giving clean sweep to BJP-led NDA government in Lok Sabha elections. Most of the exit polls have predicted over 350 seats to the NDA. Three pollsters have also predicted the NDA touching 400-seats mark. With this win, PM Modi will become the second prime minister to retain power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru.The exit polls have revealed that the INDIA bloc will fall massively short of the 285 seats predicted by Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge. The exit polls, unanimous, have predicted that the INDIA bloc will get less than 150 seats.Prime Minister Narendra Modi's mega South push may see BJP make significant gains in some key states of the region, including winning its first Lok Sabha seat in Kerala. The pollsters have also predicted considerable increase in BJP's voteshare in most of these states, with the saffron party likely to get 27% of voteshare in Kerala.In a setback for the ruling TMC in West Bengal, three pollsters have predicted that gains for BJP halting TMC’s winning streak in the state. BJP is expected to increase its 2019 score of 18 seats to 22, according to exit poll predictions. Mamata's TMC might be limited to just 19 of 42 seats.The exit polls have predicted clean sweep for BJP in New Delhi with most of the polls giving all 7 seats to the party. The alliance between Arvind Kejriwal's and Congress failed to impress the voters in the national capital.The exit polls, however, show the trends based on surveys of voters done by various organisations. These numbers and reading might not hold true on June 4 on the day of results.BJP will continue to dominate the Hindi belt, crucial in shaping political power. The BJP-led NDA is expected to win around 70 of the 80 seats in Uttar Pradesh, according to exit poll results released on Saturday. Meanwhile, opposition bloc INDIA is likely to win around 10 seats. The exit polls have also predicted clean sweep for BJP in Madhya Pradesh. The BJP-led NDA is also expected to win comfortably in Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Haryana.Although the exit polls have predicted majority for NDA in Bihar and Rajasthan, the BJP is likely to lose seats in the states. In Bihar, BJP won 17 seats with 23.58% vote share while JD(U) secured 16 seats with 21.81% vote share. Congress won only 1 seat. In 2024, BJP-JD(U) alliance is again predicted to get a majority but the BJP is likely to secure only 13-15 seats, and JD(U) 9-11. Meanwhile, RJD is likely to secure 6-7 seats and Congress 1-2 seats.In Rajasthan, the exit polls predicted gains for the Congress, though BJP will get majority with around 18 seats. Congress, which is part of the opposition INDIA bloc, is likely to make gains on 8 seats in Rajasthan.The exit polls have predicted huge gains for the BJP in Odisha with the numbers amost doubling up. In 2019, the BJD had won 12 out of the 21 seats in the state and the BJP had won 8 seats. In 2024, however, the exit poll predicts that the BJP will register significant gains in Naveen Patnaik's bastion. The INDIA bloc is not predicted to win any seat in the state.","The exit polls have predicted historic third term for PM Modi giving clean sweep to BJP-led NDA government in Lok Sabha elections.

GUWAHATI: Anticipation runs high in Arunachal Pradesh as residents await the state election results slated for Sunday. The spotlight is on BJP , the governing party that has already clinched 10 seats unopposed in the 60-member assembly, giving it a headstart on counting day.A key factor giving BJP the advantage is the weak opposition , especially Congress , which has been plagued by internal divisions and defections. Many of its functionaries and cadres have switched allegiance to BJP, further weakening the party's position.BJP is likely to benefit from turncoats - politicians from other parties who have joined its fold in exchange for party tickets. This strategy has allowed BJP to consolidate its support base and attract influential local politicians, increasing its appeal among voters, according to political observers.While the numbers seem to favour BJP, several factors could influence the final outcome and have long-term implications. The turnout, particularly among the youth and first-time voters , will be crucial in gauging public sentiment. BJP's performance in addressing local issues like infrastructure development, unemployment, and border security will be under scrutiny too.""The opposition's ability to regroup and present a united front in the future will also shape the state's political landscape,"" a political analyst said.","BJP is likely to benefit from turncoats - politicians from other parties who have joined its fold in exchange for party tickets.

Two exit polls, Matrize and Jan Ki Baat have given 21-25 and 21-26 seats to the BJP respectively.The ruling Trinamool Congress, which lost a significant number of seats in 2019, may end up losing a few more in these elections, if the exit poll predictions prove true on June 4. According to the Matrize exit poll, TMC will secure 16-20 seats. Jan Ki Baat has predicted 18-16 seats.PMARQ exit poll has predicted 22 seats for BJP and 20 for TMC.Exit poll released by D-Dynamics gave BJP 21 seats and TMC 19 seats.In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP had won 18 of the 42 seats in the state while the Trinamool emerged victorious on 22 seats. However, the Trinamool’s voteshare at 43.28% was just 3% more than the BJP’s 40.25%.The BJP’s 2019 tally, both in terms of seats and voteshare, was a huge jump from what it had managed in 2014. The saffron party had won just 2 seats with a voteshare of nearly 17% in 2014 Lok Sabha elections. On the other hand, for the Trinamool, it was a loss of 12 Lok Sabha seats from the 34 it had won five years back.The election campaign in the state was marked by very strong and sharp exchanges between the two parties. If the exit poll predictions come true on June 4, it would point to BJP making further inroads in the state.Polling was held in West Bengal across all seven phases, from April 19 to June 1, to choose 42 members for the 18th Lok Sabha. The voter turnout remained high throughout the phases, with the first phase recording an impressive 82%, followed by the second phase with over 72% turnout.

Among these, 30 seats are unreserved, while 10 are allocated for Scheduled Caste (SC) candidates and two for Scheduled Tribe (ST) candidates.Several prominent candidates contested from various constituencies, such as Abhishek Banerjee (AITC) and Amrita Roy (BJP) from Diamond Harbour and Krishnanagar, respectively. Mahua Moitra (AITC) also contested from Krishnanagar. In Tamluk, Abhijit Gangopadhyay represented the BJP. The Baharampur constituency saw a three-way contest between Yusuf Pathan (AITC), Nirmal Kumar Saha (BJP), and Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury (INC).

"New Delhi Lok Sabha election 2024 exit poll results: BJP power show to continue, AAP-Congress fail to impress",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-exit-poll-results-bjp-power-show-to-continue-aap-congress-fail-to-impress/articleshow/110623790.cms,"NEW DELHI: The exit polls have predicted another strong BJP show in the national capital of Delhi. The PMARQ exit poll has predicted BJP win on 7 of 7 seats. Axis-MyIndia has also predicted 6 seats for BJP, and 1 for INDIA bloc.Today's Chanakya and Polstrat also predicted a clean sweep of BJP in the national capital, where the INDIA bloc is nowhere to be seen. The CVoter Exit Poll projected 1-3 seats for INDIA bloc while the BJP got 4-6 seats.Polling for the seven parliamentary constituencies in Delhi was held on May 25 in the sixth phase of the Lok Sabha elections . According to the Election Commission of India, a voter turnout of 58.69% was recorded in the national capital. Among the seven constituencies, North East Delhi recorded the highest turnout at 62.89%, while New Delhi had the lowest at 55.43%.In the last two Lok Sabha elections, the BJP decimated both the AAP and the Congress as it won all the 7 seats. The Congress was relegated to third spot in most of the seats. In the 2019 elections, BJP got 56.86% of the vote share, while the Congress secured 22.51% and AAP polled 18.11% of the votes.This time around Congress and AAP have joined hands under the INDIA banner to prevent a BJP clean sweep in Delhi. AAP contested on four seats leaving the rest three for the Congress.The BJP, meanwhile, changed 6 out of the 7 sitting MPs in the national capital. Manoj Tiwari was the only sitting MP who was renominated by the party from North East Delhi.The exit poll results predict some cheers for the AAP-Congress alliance. However, the actual verdict of the people of Delhi will be known on June 4, when the votes are counted.Delhi, with its seven parliamentary constituencies, plays a crucial role in national politics. The capital has historically seen a direct contest between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress.

BENGALURU: Karnataka police's SIT probing sexual harassment allegations against JD(S) legislator HD Revanna 's family has started extensive searches for his wife Bhavani in a kidnap case involving an alleged survivor.Revanna himself was earlier arrested in the case but got bail. He has been questioned in the matter and is said to have ""forgotten"" the name of his father-in-law.According to sources, SIT teams looking for Bhavani searched over a dozen houses of contractors known to the Revanna family and their relatives in Hassan and Mysuru on Saturday. One of the teams visited Bhavani's residence in Hassan's Holenarasipura but did not find her there.The abducted woman's son had alleged she was taken away by one Satish Babanna at the behest of Bhavani and Revanna. Babanna has been arrested.Officials said Bhavani - a former member of the Hassan zilla panchayat - had switched off her mobile on May 6 after the Siddaramaiah-led Congress govt formed the SIT to probe the cases against her son, arrested MP Prajwal , and her husband. She cooperated with police for a while, though her cellphone stayed switched off. Later, she went off the police radar. A local court earlier denied Bhavani anticipatory bail.Revanna's alleged inability to recall the name of his father-in-law came to the fore when SIT sleuths were connecting the dots in the abduction case. Revanna was asked the question as Babanna had claimed during interrogation that Bhavani's father Shivanne Gowda was his uncle.Revanna said he knew Bhavani had a brother named Prakash but claimed to have forgotten her father's name, according to SIT sources. SIT has mentioned this in court papers, claiming it is an attempt to conceal familial ties key to the case.On Saturday, Prajwal was interrogated by the SIT for seven hours in one of the sexual harassment cases filed against him in Holenarasipura. Sources said Prajwal was not cooperating and kept denying the allegations.The outgoing Hassan MP was arrested early Friday at Bengaluru airport after flying in from Munich.","SIT teams looking for Bhavani searched over a dozen houses of contractors known to the Revanna family and their relatives in Hassan and Mysuru.

"Kerala Lok Sabha Election 2024 Exit Poll Results: BJP may open its account in Kerala, predict exit polls",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kerala-lok-sabha-election-2024-exit-poll-results-exit-polls-predict-19-seats-for-udf/articleshow/110621942.cms,"NEW DELHI: The exit poll results for Lok Sabha elections 2024 in Kerala were announced on Saturday.As per ETG, NDA is poised to win 1 seat in Kerala, while Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) is set to win 19 seats.On the other hand, C-voter predicted 17-19 seats for UDF and 1-3 seats for NDA.Moreover, Axis My India projected that BJP will win 2-3 seats, Congress 13-14 seats, and LDF 0-1 seats.As per ETG and C-voter, LDF will not be able to open its account in Kerala. On the contrary, IPSOS predicted 2-5 seats for Left Democratic Front (LDF), 1-3 seats for BJP, and 15-18 seats for the UDF.The Election Commission of India ( ECI ) on March 16, 2024, announced the upcoming Lok Sabha election dates. Polling for all the 20 Lok Sabha seats in Kerala took place on April 26, 2024. Like in the past General Elections, Kerala had its elections on a single day, in the second phase of polling of the2024 Lok Sabha elections. The election notification was issued on March 28 and the last date for submission of nominations was April 4.As the EC announced the polling date for the Lok Sabha elections 2024, the political landscape in the southern state had been set ablaze with campaigns and strategic maneuvering. With 20 Lok Sabha seats up for grabs, Kerala stands as a crucial battleground where diverse issues ranging from national policies to local issues shaped the electoral discourse.The political discourse surrounding the elections in Kerala was multifaceted, showcasing a mix of national and regional influences. From the contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Act to the complexities surrounding electoral bonds, and from incidents of ragging to the persistent challenges of man-animal conflicts, the spectrum of issues resonating with voters was broad and diverse.One of the key highlights of the Lok Sabha elections 2024 has been the fierce competition between the Left Democratic Front (LDF) and the Indian National Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF). The LDF, buoyed by its recent performance, fielded heavyweight candidates across the state, sending out a clear message that its alliance within the INDIA bloc holds no importance for the Left coalition in Kerala.Prime Minister Narendra Modi's active involvement in Kerala's electoral landscape injected a new dimension into the campaign dynamics. With frequent visits aimed at bridging the north-south political divide, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) wanted to expand its footprint in the state, posing a formidable challenge to established players.In the high-profile constituency of Wayanad, all eyes are set on the battle between Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and LDF's Annie Raja, symbolizing a clash of political titans.Similarly, in Thiruvananthapuram, the contest between Congress's Shashi Tharoor and LDF's Pannian Raveendran promises an intense electoral showdown.Thrissur also emerges as a closely observed constituency with three prominent contenders. The Congress has fielded K Muraleedharan, a decision made amidst the backdrop of his sister, Padmaja Venugopal, defecting to the BJP from the Congress. Prime Minister Narendra Modi personally inaugurated the NDA's campaign in January, endorsing actor-turned-politician Suresh Gopi. Meanwhile, VS Sunil Kumar, representing the CPI, enjoys familiarity among the electorate in the Thrissur constituency.In the 2019 elections, Alappuzha was the only constituency where the CPI(M) managed to secure a victory. However, in 2024 polls, the Congress has asserted its presence in the region by fielding a heavyweight candidate, KC Venugopal, who serves as the AICC general secretary.Kerala holds the 12th rank in terms of the number of Lok Sabha seats, comprising a total of 20 constituencies. Among these, 18 are unreserved, while two are reserved for Scheduled Caste (SC) candidates.In the 2019 Parliamentary elections, the United Democratic Front (UDF) emerged victorious in 19 out of the 20 seats. The lone seat secured by the Left Democratic Front (LDF) was in Alappuzha, won by the CPI(M)."," exit poll results for Lok Sabha elections 2024 in Kerala were announced on Saturday.

Seats of interest for the BJP

NEW DELHI: Drawing from five exit polls, DMK led INDIA bloc is poised to get 36 seats, two for the BJP led NDA and one for the AIADMK is expected.Axis my India's break up predicts 20-22 to DMK, 6-8 to Congress, 0-2 to AIADMK, and 1-3 for the BJP NDA alliance with an increase in vote share up to 14 percent. While, C Voter predicts 37-39 for INDIA bloc, up to 2 seats for the NDA alliance and a blank for the AIADMK.Poll of pollsThirty-nine Lok Sabha seats from Tamil Nadu went to polls on April 19 in the first phase of the general election .The EC announced that Tamil Nadu registered a voter turnout of 69.46%, almost 3.5 percentage points lower than in the 2019 general elections. The Election Commission had earlier announced a 72% turnout, but it revised the figure later.In the previous 2019 elections, the DMK-led alliance triumphed in 38 out of 39 seats in Tamil Nadu.The DMK contested on 22 seats and spearheads an eight-party alliance comprising the Congress (9), CPI(M) (2), CPI (2), Indian Muslim League (1), Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (2), Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (1), and Kongunadu Makkal Desia Katchi (KMDK), whose candidate will run on the DMK symbol.On the other side, the AIADMK (34 seats) lead an alliance with four parties, including the Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (5 seats). Additionally, candidates from Puthiya Tamilagam and Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) contested on the AIADMK symbol.The BJP, contesting on 23 seats, formed an alliance with nine other parties, such as the Pattali Makkal Katchi (10 seats), Tamil Maanila Congress (Moopanar) (3), and splinter groups of the AIADMK, including former chief minister O. Pannerselvam (1) standing as an independent, and Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (2) led by TTV Dhinakaran. Indhiya Jananayaga Katchi, Puthiya Needhi Katchi, and Tamizhaga Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam will each contest on the BJP symbol.With the AIADMK and BJP candidates vying to challenge the DMK, some closely contested battles are expected within these alliances. Notably, a total of 21 incumbents from the INDIA bloc have been renominated across Tamil Nadu, including prominent figures like Kanimozhi Karunanidhi, Su. Venkatesan, S Jothimani, TR Baalu, and Thamizhachi Thangapandian.The election witnessed direct face-offs among DMK, AIADMK, and BJP candidates in ten constituencies, such as Coimbatore, Chennai North, Chennai South, Vellore, and others.Notably, in Chennai South, the contest involve the incumbent MP Thamizhachi Thangapandian (DMK), J. Jayavardhan (AIADMK), and Tamilisai Soundararajan (BJP).Key issues in the election have revolved around the DMK-Congress alliance's stance on federalism, portraying the BJP as a threat to minority and Dalit communities, and criticising the alleged bias against Tamil students in exams like NEET.Opposition parties have also highlighted issues such as corruption allegations against Stalin's family, the drug trade, and high electricity prices in the state.The BJP is hoping to make major headway in a state that has never given it more than four seats (in the 1999 Lok Sabha elections). It failed to open its account in 2019 while its partner, the AIADMK, managed to win the seat of Theni by a narrow vote margin of 6.2%.High-octane poll campaigning in Tamil Nadu this time around saw the BJP go all out and rake up hot-button issues like Katchatheevu to lure voters away from the Congress as well as regional parties like the AIADMK (its past ally) or M K Stalin's DMK (which has allied with the Congress in the 2024 elections).Revealing the importance of the state in the BJP's poll strategy, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has visited Tamil Nadu at least 8 times in the past four months and has held several rallies and roadshows to drum up support for the party as well as its star candidate K Annamalai.The BJP contested on 23 seats, while it's much smaller allies fought on the remaining 16 seats. BJP state unit chief Annamalaiwas pitted from Coimbatore, a seat that the party lost by a vote margin of 14.6% in the 2019 polls to P. R. Natarajan of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) CPM.Lok Sabha seats of Chidambaram, Vellore and Dharmapuri, Theni and Tiruppur saw a neck to neck fight where victory margin was less than 10% in the last Lok Sabha polls.","DMK led INDIA bloc is poised to get 36 seats, two for the BJP led NDA and one for the AIADMK is expected.

NEW DELHI: Flanked by netas of the INDIA bloc , Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge on Saturday claimed the opposition alliance would win more than 295 seats and form the next govt at the Centre. He said the figure was arrived at based on people's feedback to alliance heads.The opposition has sought a meeting with the EC before AAP chief Kejriwal's ""surrender"" on Sunday to convey their concerns about the counting process and to urge the poll panel to issue instructions as sought to the returning officers. The opposition wants postal ballots to be counted before EVMs, and precedence to Form 17C over EVMs in case of discrepancy in numbers. tnnCalling it ""janata ka exit poll"", Kharge said the figure was arrived at based on people's feedback to the alliance heads. He called it the ""real exit poll"" as against ""govt's exit poll"" which was released ""to create hype for BJP"".""BJP and its allies will discuss the exit polls. We wanted to put across the truth to ensure there was no confusion because of their narrative,"" he said. The claim followed a meeting at Kharge's residence which went on for over two hours and was attended by the leading lights of the INDIA bloc like Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, Sharad Pawar of NCP, Farooq Abdullah (NC), Sitaram Yechury (CPM), Dipankar Bhattacharya (CPI-ML),Akhilesh Yadav (SP), Tejashwi Yadav (RJD), Champai Soren and Kalpana Soren (JMM), T R Baalu (DMK), Arvind Kejriwal and Bhagwant Mann (AAP), D Raja (CPI), Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, K C Venugopal, Ramgopal Yadav, Sanjay Singh, Sanjay Yadav and Raghav Chadha. As earlier announced by West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee, TMC did not attend the meeting. PDP also stayed away.Later, Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh alleged home minister Amit Shah was calling up district magistrates and collectors and had spoken to 150 of them, in what he claimed was ""tantamount to intimidation and showed BJP's desperation"". ""Let it be very clear: the will of the people shall prevail, and on June 4, Modi, Shah and BJP will exit, and INDIA Janban-dhan will be victorious,"" Ramesh said on X.Sources said netas from key states exchanged notes and arrived at the figure of 295-plus, with a good tally expected in Maharashtra, Bihar and UP, which was termed as a figure ""radically different from 2019"". At the same time, the feedback in the meeting was that BJP would not open its account in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Punjab. Also, it was felt that unlike 2019, the opposition would chip away at BJP numbers in states like Haryana, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Himachal and Uttarakhand. The feedback was that BJP would be ""south mein saaf, north mein half"", a tagline coined by the opposition during the elections.Sources said the discussions were largely focused on ""counting-related anomalies"" experienced in the past. One key concern raised was counting of postal ballots, which the opposition said should precede the counting of EVMs. Referring to UP and Bihar assembly elections, it was said that postal ballots were counted after the EVM votes at many centres, and it made the difference in a good number of constituencies.The parties want their counting agents to be vigilant in ""close seats"" with margins of around 50,000 votes, figuring these as contests ""that are vulnerable to counting related anomalies"". The opposition argue that EC should give precedence to Form 17C over EVMs in case of a discrepancy in numbers.Kharge said, ""We discussed many issues, especially the problems that can arise during counting and how they should be resolved. We have to give instructions to our workers. Many alliance members have already cautioned them, but as a precaution we had to convey to all about how to function on counting day."" He said the agents have been told that they should stay in the counting centres till the end, follow all formalities and not leave the hall till they receive the certificates. Kharge will hold a virtual meeting with party candidates on Sunday.","The opposition has sought a meeting with the EC before AAP chief Kejriwal's ""surrender"" on Sunday.
