The JDS chief HD Deve Gowda and the Congress state president DK Shivakumar are members of the Vokkaliga community.The third phase is planned for May 7 and will see voting in 94 constituencies across 12 states and union territories.

"69% vote in Karnataka Phase-1 for 14 LS seats, Bengaluru limps to 57%",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/69-vote-in-karnataka-phase-1-for-14-ls-seats-bengaluru-limps-to-57/articleshow/109639136.cms,"‘Expected city to fare better this time’

BENGALURU: Over 69% of voters in 14 Lok Sabha constituencies of coastal and southern Karnataka turned up to exercise their franchise on Friday, and the provisional voting percentage almost mirrors the figures notched up in the previous two polls: 70.4% in 2019 and 68% in 2014.Bengaluru continued to remain on a sticky wicket with its overall subpar performance of 57%.Mysuru, for the first time, hit the ball out of the park crossing 70% against 69.5% in 2019 and 67.3% in 2014. With this round of polling, the fate of 247 candidates has been sealed, and the remaining 14 seats in central and northern Karnataka will vote on May 7.The seemingly middling turnout in the first phase is yet commendable as voters braved the heat to keep their tryst with the voting exercise. After the final tabulation on the morrow, the overall voting percentage is expected to rise by a couple of percentage of points, helping the figure sail over the psychological 70 mark.Of the four seats, Bangalore Rural reported the best turnout of 67.3% compared to 64.9% in 2019 and Central recor ded 52.8% compared to 54.3% in 2019, while it was 53.1% in South (53.7% in 2019). North had breached the 50% mark by 5pm and ended with 54.4%, compared to 54.8% in 2019.All four seats had seen a dip in turnout compared to 2014, with Bangalore South recording the least.The low turnout in the four-seat Bengaluru cluster is attributable to high temperatures and largely to continuing apathy. The issue of electoral roll inflation also continues to plague Bengaluru.Mandya, which had seen a lot of campaigning action in the run-up to the polling day, emerged on top again, registering 81.5% turnout.In 2019 and 2014 too, the tally had crossed 80% mark, making them the most robust voting constituency in the state.The 14 seats continued to witness the trend of rural voters pulling up the overall voting percentage in Karnataka with Bengaluru’s low proving to be a drag. The lowest polling was recorded in Bangalore Central with just over 52%.In a bid to beat the late forenoon and afternoon heat, voters stood in long queues early in the morning across the state.The voter turnout was the highest between 7am and 11am with 22% and post 3pm when Karnataka saw close to 18% of the total voters casting their ballot.Barring isolated cases of vandalism, missing votes and mismatches in the electoral roll, leading to a few voters being unable to cast their ballot, the state saw peaceful voting across the constituencies.As the day progressed and temperatures soared past 37°C, Bengalureans failed to show much enthusiasm in exercising their franchise.“We expected the city to perform better this time. After multiple consultations and reviews with local authorities, we had identified problematic areas and planned a targeted approach to educate voters and create awareness. Yet, the city did n ot improve on its previous tally,” said a senior official from the Chief Elec toral Office of Karnataka.Political parties, too, were upset about the outcome and blamed stringent measures initiated by the Election Commission for the poor turnout.A candidate from Bangalore Central said: “There are restrictions on holding community engagement events in clubs and marriage halls. We will be charged expenses if a bike or any other rally is held. Given the time constraint, it is difficult to connect with a ll voters through doorto-door campaigns alone.”“More events would have increased awareness among the general public. Digital platforms help in reaching out to one section of society but not all,” the candidate pointed out.","Bengaluru continues to remain on a sticky wicket with its overall subpar performance of 57%.

Is that even possible? Is he doing this out of nervousness,” Priyanka Gandhi responded. She also targeted Modi over inflation, labeling him as a “mehengai” man.Furthermore, in a twist to the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's slogan of ""ab ki baar 400 paar,"" Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, in a rally in Maharashtra, asserted that the public has recognized the theatrics of the current government. She unveiled her own mantra: ""ab ki baar aap ki sarkar, ab ki baar janata ki sarkar"" (this time, a government run by you, a government run by the people).Rahul Gandhi also took aim at Narendra Modi over his claims. ""You have heard the prime minister’s speeches. He is scared. It’s possible that he may shed tears on stage,"" he said on Friday.","Priyanka Gandhi took a jocular stance on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent accusations of "" wealth redistribution "" She likened them to the ramblings of an uncle at weddings.

A level playing field which is a pre requisite for 'free and fair elections' has clearly been compromised with the illegal arrest of the Petitioner,"" Kejriwal told the Supreme Court.""The present case is a classic case of how the ruling party-led central government has misused the central agency- Enforcement Directorate and its wide powers under PMLA to crush its biggest political opponent -Aam Aadmi Party and its leaders. The corresponding paras of SLP are reiterated and relied upon herein and not repeated for the sake of brevity,"" he added.Delhi chief minister also claimed that the central agency has no proof or material demonstrating that theAam Aadmi Party has received advanced kickbacks from the South lobby, let alone utilizing them in the Goa election campaign.“Not a single rupee was traced back to the AAP, and the allegations put forth in this regard are devoid of any tangible evidence, rendering them vague, baseless without any corroboration,” Kejriwal said.Kejriwal's response comes days after the Enforcement Director filed an affidavit in the Delhi Excise policy case and claimed that Delhi chief minister played a central role in the excise policy case, acting as the ""kingpin and key conspirator."" The probe agency asserted that arresting an individual based on evidence of an offense does not undermine the principles of free and fair elections.According to the ED , Kejriwal allegedly collaborated with his ministers and AAP leaders, and was involved in ""demanding kickbacks"" from liquor businessmen in return for favors granted through the policy.Kejriwal was arrested by the ED on March 21 in connection with a money laundering probe relating to alleged irregularities in the now-scrapped Delhi excise policy 2021-22.On April 9, the Delhi high court upheld Kejriwal's arrest, citing his repeated non-compliance with central agency's summons as a compelling factor necessitating his arrest.","Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday filed his response on the Enforcement Directorate's affidavit in the Supreme Court.

Thakur asked people to decide whether they want to keep their property or give it to Muslims.This criticism comes after Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other leaders accused the Congress of planning to take away people's wealth and give it to Muslims. The PM claimed that the Congress-led government in the past had said that Muslims should get the first share of the country's resources. These remarks have caused a lot of controversy, with some people criticizing the PM for using negative terms for Muslims and others criticizing former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for his alleged statements.Thakur further added, ""The 'Tukde-tukde' gang has surrounded Congress completely and has hijacked their ideology... You have to decide whether you want to go with Congress' 'Tukde-tukde' gang or Narendra Modi who believes in 'Ek Bharat, Shrestha Bharat'. You have to decide whether the children's property should remain with them or should it go to Muslims. We gave all rights to Muslims, equally... But we did not give it based on religion, we gave it because it was their right...

Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra launched a scathing attack on BJP-led NDA govt over inflation and unemployment during a campaign rally for Lok Sabha elections in Dharampur of Gujarat’s Valsad district on Saturday. She alleged that BJP would alter the Constitution if it came to office for a third time. “Many BJP functionaries are saying they will change the Constitution.But Modiji is denying it. First, they will always deny what they want to do. But after coming to office, they will implement it. They want to change the Constitution to weaken the common people and deprive them of their rights,” Priyanka said.Priyanka referred to PM Modi as “mehengai man”. “Modiji is portrayed as a big leader. On the other hand, see how people are struggling. People are unemployed, and the unemployment rate is the highest ever in the country,” she said.She said Modi is portrayed as an able leader, but people are unemployed and the unemployment rate is the highest ever in the country. “People fear telling him anything. The PM is so arrogant, no one can tell him anything. How would he know what problems people are facing? When I was young, I used to be with Indiraji and Rajivji. People of Amethi would scold them for roads, but they did not take offence. They were assured of roads,” she said.Priyanka praised former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee, referring to him as a “sabhya insaan” (civilised person).She criticised BJP govt’s handling of women’s security and its response to protests by Olympic medallists as well as Hathras and Unnao gang rapes.Regarding electoral bonds, she alleged: “They came up with a scheme of political donation. The BJP raided many people and took funds. They have accepted funds from those involved in the bridge collapse, from the makers of corona vaccine.”Priyanka highlighted Congress’s manifesto, which addresses issues faced by the tribal population. The party will bring an MGNREGA-like scheme for urban areas where families will get 100 days of guaranteed work, she said.She also outlined Congress’s agenda, including filling approximately 30 lakh vacancies in govt jobs, providing subsidised diesel to fishermen, increasing the minimum wage to Rs 400, and implementing “sub-plans” for STs and SCs. She advocated for a special budget for tribal people and the declaration of tribal-dominated areas as scheduled areas.","Priyanka Gandhi Vadra launched a scathing attack on BJP-led NDA govt over inflation and unemployment.

26/11 prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam gets BJP ticket,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/26/11-prosecutor-ujjwal-nikam-gets-bjp-ticket/articleshow/109654813.cms,"TOI

New Delhi: BJP has fielded 26/11 prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam as its candidate from Mumbai North Central seat, dropping two-term incumbent Poonam Mahajan from the contest.Nikam, a prominent presence on prime time TV during the trial of Ajmal Kasab, the sole survivor among the Lashkar gang who went on a rampage killing innocents, as well as during the trial of the accused in the 1993 serial blasts, is expected to be a good fit for BJP’s “tough-on-terrorism” plank.He has come in place of the daughter of late BJP leader stalwart Pramod Mahajan.“We can serve society and the country through politics. I have received this opportunity to serve the nation. Therefore, I consider myself lucky,” said Nikam after being named as BJP’s candidate., in its edition of April 23, had reported the BJP leadership’s plan to drop Poonam and Jamyang Tsering Namgyal, the incumbent at Ladakh, who has been substituted by Tashi Gyalson.With this, the spotlight has turned on the party leadership’s plans for Kaiserganj seat in UP, amid indications that the party is considering replacing sitting MP Brij Bhushan Singh, who is accused of sexually harassing women wrestlers, with his wife Ketki Singh.Poonam’s axing is also seen as symbolising the leadership’s twin messages of “party comes first” and “nobody is indispensable”. Though relatively young, she was twice fielded from Mumbai North Central, seen as a tribute to the contribution made by her father Pramod Mahajan. Poonam was also made the chief of the party’s youth wing. While her career seemed to be on the rise, indications of the leadership souring on her surfaced soon because of what sources described as “intensity deficit”. Sources said that she was not able to fulfill the BJP leadership’s expectations.Poonam, in her first reaction after being replaced, took the decision gracefully and thanked the BJP leadership for allowing her to represent the constituency for 10 years.“I will always be indebted to the family-like people of the area for loving me not only as an MP but also like a daughter, and I hope that this relationship will always remain. My role model, my father Late Pramod Mahajan Ji showed me the path of ‘Nation first, then us’. I pray to God that I can follow the same path throughout my life,” she said in a post on X.The fate of Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh hangs in the balance as his chances of being a BJP nominee have further diminished after a Delhi court on Friday rejected a plea filed by him seeking directions to Delhi Police to further investigate the allegations of sexual harassment levelled against him by women wrestlers.The court said it will pronounce an order on the framing of charges on May 7 — the last date of filing of nominations is May 3.There are speculations that Namgyal was dropped in favour of Gyalson to calm the tension in Ladakh over demands for statehood and inclusion in Sixth Schedule.",Ujjwal Nikam is expected to be a good fit for BJP’s “tough-on-terrorism’ plank.

But to ensure the temple was built, 60 kar sevaks sacrificed their lives at Godhra railway station.

"Arrest illegal and arbitrary, ED acting with malice: CM Kejriwal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/arrest-illegal-and-arbitrary-ed-acting-with-malice-cm-kejriwal/articleshow/109654679.cms,":

CM in a letter says

NEW DELHIAccusing the Centre of “misusing” Enforcement Directorate to “crush” its political opponents ahead of the parliamentary elections, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has told Supreme Court that his arrest was illegal, arbitrary and an unprecedented assault on the tenets of democracy based on free and fair elections and federalism.Countering the allegations of the agency that he was the “kingpin” of the alleged excise policy scam, CM said ED was acting with “malicious intent” against him in a gross affront to due process of law and there was no evidence of money laundering against him and his party, AAP.He said that the case was registered almost two years ago but the agency decided to act against him only after election dates were announced to give an “unjust upper hand” to central govt in the elections.Kejriwal, in his affidavit filed in the apex court, said, “The mode, manner and timing of the arrest of the petitioner just before the Lok Sabha elections , when the schedule had been announced and the model code of conduct had come into play, speaks volumes about the arbitrariness of ED. This timeline establishes the fact that the petitioner has been arrested intentionally with mala fide intent without any necessity to arrest.”Responding to the allegation that he misused his office and demanded a bribe, the CM said, “The present case is a classic case of how the ruling party-led central govt has misused the central agency, ED, and its wide powers under PMLA to crush its biggest political opponent, Aam Aadmi Party, and its leaders.”He told the apex court that the ED’s statement that he defied summons is a “blatant falsehood” as each summons had been duly responded to by raising pertinent issues which have not been responded to and the probe agency has maintained an “eerie silence”.“There is also an issue of the ED abusing its power of arrest in the middle of the general elections and while relying on the same material as was in possession months before its arrest. In such circumstances, the case of the petitioner is peculiar and grave and warrants urgent intervention of this court to protect life and liberty of an individual...The petitioner’s arrest constitutes an unprecedented assault on the tenets of democracy based on ‘free and fair elections’ and ‘federalism’, both of which form significant constituents of the basic structure of Constitution,” he said.“The central govt agency illegally ‘picked up’ a sitting chief minister and the national convenor of one of the six national opposition parties in India just five days after the general elections were called and the model code of conduct was put in place. The petitioner’s political party is in direct opposition to the ruling political party at the Centre in the on-going elections. During an election cycle when political activity is at its highest, his illegal arrest has caused grave prejudice to his political party and will provide the ruling party at the Centre an unjust upper hand in the ongoing elections,” he said.Kejriwal argued that “the entire basis of the petitioner’s arrest rests upon certain statements which are in the nature of self-incriminating confessions by alleged accomplices who have been given immunity by way of pardon etc. These alleged incriminating evidences, therefore, were obtained under an arrangement without any corroborative evidence.”In this context, he recalled the chain of events involving Magunta Sreenivasulu Reddy, P Sarath Reddy and Satya Vijay Naik. He accused ED of suppressing certain statements. “It is a settled law by this Hon’ble Court that it is the investigating officer’s duty to ‘unearth the truth’ but not to prosecute the accused person by cherry picking a few statements here and there…This approach would clearly reveal that ED proceeds on the basis that it has a right to conceal documents which are in favour of the accused from the court and the accused. This negates the very principle of fair trial and fair investigation.”Dealing with the allegation of cash payments to an AAP candidate in the Goa elections, the affidavit says, “There exists no proof or material demonstrating that AAP received funds or advanced kickbacks from the South group, let alone utilizing them in the Goa election campaign. Not a single rupee was traced back to AAP and the allegations put forth in the regard are devoid of any tangible evidence, rendering them vague and baseless without any corroboration.”Responding to the allegation of “large-scale destruction of evidence” as a ground for his arrest, Kejriwal said there is not a single averment alleging destruction of evidence of any kind by him and hence the ground cited was devoid of any merit.The present case is a classic case of how the ruling party-led central govt has misused the central agency, ED, and its wide powers under PMLA to crush its biggest political opponent, Aam Aadmi Party, and its leaders","Arvind Kejriwal has told Supreme Court that his arrest was illegal, arbitrary and an unprecedented assault on the tenets of democracy. He said ED was acting with “malicious intent” against him in a gross affront to due process of law and there was no evidence of money laundering against him and his party, AAP.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109654686,imgsize-1277445,width-400,resizemode-4/109654686.jpg"

It’s Congress that wants to change Constitution: PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/its-congress-that-wants-to-change-constitution-pm-modi/articleshow/109654630.cms,"KOLHAPUR/VASCO: PM Modi alleged at a campaign rally in Kolhapur, Maharashtra, on Saturday that Congress wants to extend the “Karnataka model” of offering reservation to all Muslims in the country by “planning a dacoity on 27% OBC quota”, and that it “plans to change the Constitution for this appeasement”.Later, addressing a rally in Sancoale, South Goa, Modi said “the Constitution holds no significance” for Congress.“With the kind of clarification given by Congress candidate (Viriato Fernandes for South Goa), Congress’s hidden agenda has been exposed… And this isn’t a singular instance, they have talked of disintegrating the country earlier, too,” Modi said.In Goa, he reiterated his allegations of the last few days that Congress wants to impose a 55% inheritance tax . “The mystery of Congress’s shehzada has been unravelled. He has brought an X-ray machine from abroad by which he intends to assess your wealth and redistribute it among its vote bank,” he said. “And you know who their vote bank is,” he added. “If a fisherman wants to bequeath two of his boats to his son, he will be able to give only one.”In Kolhapur, Modi also claimed INDIA bloc partners are dreaming of forming govt and planning to share the PM’s post amongst themselves. “One year, one PM is their plan… But such formulas will not work,” he said.Modi said Congress and the INDIA bloc have their eyes set on wealth earned by common people, including the jewellery of women. “Congress’s Shehzada is going to bring inheritance tax through which 50% of the wealth earned by you will be recovered. Your wealth will be distributed to those whom they had once said have the first right over India’s wealth,” Modi said.He also accused Congress and DMK of trying to create narratives to divide the country and alleged that state govts in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu are openly talking about carving out a separate nation for southern states. “‘Ahad (from) Tanjavar, Tahad (to) Peshawar is our land’ was Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s slogan for achieving the goal of Hindavi Swarajya. Will you (Kolhapur residents) support Congress’s agenda to divide the country,” Modi asked.Modi claimed Congress was unable to compete with BJP ’s track record of development and hence started using “anti-national and appeasement planks” in poll campaigns. “Are they (Congress) aware what their situation will be if they dare revoke CAA?” Modi said.“DMK leaders called Sanatan Dharma dengue and malaria. I was surprised when an INDIA bloc partner invited DMK leaders in Maharashtra and felicitated them. Nakli (fake) Shiv Sena is walking shoulder-to-shoulder with those who praised Aurangzeb. Balasaheb Thackeray’s aatma (soul) would certainly be unhappy over his (Uddhav Thackeray’s) deeds,” said Modi.Maharashtra chief minister Eknath Shinde, deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis, and RPI leader Ramdas Athawale also addressed the rally.In Goa, the PM referred to his special “relation” with the state. “Whatever I am today, every turning point of my life has been in Goa. The decision of my party to make me PM was taken in Goa. My fate is written in Goa. This is why I say that I need two strong colleagues in Parliament…” Modi said.Modi’s connection to Goa dates back to April 2002. At the BJP executive committee meeting in the aftermath of the post-Godhra riots, Modi, then chief minister of Gujarat, overcame stiff opposition, first from party members and then from PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee, to retain his post with the support of national executive members.","Modi claims Congress wants to extend the “Karnataka model’ of offering reservation to all Muslims in the country by “planning a dacoity on 27% OBC quota” “If a fisherman wants to bequeath two of his boats to his son, he will be able to give only one,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109654638,imgsize-1226246,width-400,resizemode-4/109654638.jpg"

to

contest

the election against him or Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Goyal is BJP candidate from Mumbai-North and Congress yet to announce a candidate against him.

While addressing a press conference in Dahisar on Saturday, Goyal said, “I challenge Rahul Gandhi to contest the election from the Mumbai-North seat as he is losing from Wayanad (Kerala).

Rahul should contest from Amethi, or if he has the guts, contest from Varanasi. He should contest from 4-5 seats; by luck, he may win from somewhere,” said Piyush Goyal.

While replying to a question during the press conference, Goyal suggested Rahul Gandhi visit the Ram temple in Ayodhya. Goyal said, “Rahul Gandhi should visit the Ram temple, where he should apologize for all the corruption his party committed over the years, for his statements about dividing the country, and for abusing Sanatan Dharma.”

Goyal is the BJP candidate from Mumbai North, which is considered the party’s safest seat.

Its sitting MP, Gopal Shetty, had won by a record margin in the previous election against Congress’s candidate and actor Urmila Matondkar. Despite being on the BJP star campaigners’ list, Goyal has only left the constituency a few times to campaign for party candidates in other states. He is spending most of his time in the Mumbai-North constituency, which includes areas of Dahisar, Borivali, Kandivali, and Malad.

The opposition has yet to announce a candidate for the seat against Goyal. Goyal continues his campaign by meeting people and visiting areas to understand their issues. According to his supporters, he has over 12 engagements daily, meeting with party organizations' office bearers, locals, and visiting societies. In several places, NGOs, societies, associations, and professionals organize programs under their own names, without associating with the party, for Goyal.","Piyush Goyal is BJP candidate from Mumbai-North and Congress yet to announce a candidate against him.

Goyal said, “In ‘Modi Ki Guarantee’, the very first chapter talks about the welfare of the poor, including slum redevelopment and rehabilitation.

Under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY), we provided houses to four crore people, and three crore more will receive houses. Similarly, we will provide in-situ housing for slums.”

When asked about the hurdle of rehabilitating slums that have encroached on mangroves and SGNP, Goyal said, “We will take the help of experts and advanced technology to find solutions.”

While he admitted he was not an expert, he assured that advanced technology would be utilised to find solutions, including for rehabilitation of tribals living in SGNP. Goyal also reiterated his confidence after two phases of the election, his party will secure more than 400 seats.

After the conference, he launched his campaign rath at Borivali and is expected to file his nomination paper on Tuesday. Goyal stated he has been interacting with people in the constituency to understand their issues and assured them that after his election, he will escalate their issues to the highest level to find solutions, including redevelopment of old, dilapidated buildings in the constituency.

Goyal also mentioned that establishing a large multi-specialty hospital in the constituency is a priority for him, along with extending the Harbour line till Borivali and addressing traffic issues.

Samajwadi Party

chief

Akhilesh Yadav

declared on Saturday that the Bharatiya Janata Party (

) has refrained from using the '

400 paar

' slogan since the commencement of

Lok Sabha

elections.

Addressing reporters in Kanpur Dehat, Akhilesh Yadav maintained that the BJP's rallying cry of '400 paar' (winning over 400 seats) has now been replaced by '400 haar' (defeat in 400 seats).

Akhilesh Yadav interacted with the people in Rasoolabad area of Kanpur Dehat district, Bela area of Auraiya district and Umrada area of Kannauj during his public outreach campaign. All these areas fall under the Kannauj Lok Sabha seat.

The former Uttar Pradesh chief minister took a swipe at the BJP's campaign messaging, noting that the party is now emphasizing discussions about the Constitution and

reservation

policies instead of boldly promoting their '400 paar' slogan.

“The BJP has been flipped by the people and they are lagging behind. This is not '400 paar', it is '400 haar'. I have heard that they are unable to raise the slogan of '400 paar'. Now they are speaking of the Constitution and reservation.

They have understood that the people are voting to save the Constitution,” Akhilesh Yadav said.

He mentioned that the Samajwadi Party had pledged to provide free wheat and free data if the INDIA bloc come to power at the center.

Akhilesh Yadav filed his nomination from Uttar Pradesh's Kannauj Lok Sabha seat on Thursday.

Ahead of the 2024 elections, ""400 paar"" was the BJP's rallying cry, projecting confidence and a potential landslide victory.

No poison found in Mukhtar Ansari's viscera in Banda jail. CJM ordered a probe after his death. Post-mortem confirmed heart attack. Viscera sent to Lucknow. Doctors and check-up details under investigation.

Viscera test results of Mukhtar are meaningless: Afzal Ansari

Afzal Ansari disputes Mukhtar Ansari's viscera test results, alleging foul play and government protection of criminals linked to Dawood Ibrahim. He demands further investigation by an AIIMS doctors panel to uncover the truth.

Nowhera Shaik, pitted against Owaisi, promises to become 'voice of Hyderabad'

Nowher Shaik of AIMEP challenges Asaduddin Owaisi in Hyderabad, focusing on economic growth, healthcare, women's empowerment. She emphasizes job creation, urbanization challenges, and promises continued engagement post-election.

VARANASI: Hyderabad MP and AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi kicked up a row when he said that gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari – who died in judicial custody on March 28 – was poisoned .Addressing a public meeting in Varanasi on Thursday, Owaisi referred to Mukhtar as a “martyr”. “Mukhtar Ansari was in judicial custody, and he was killed by giving poison.He is a martyr , don’t call him dead. It was the responsibility of the BJP govt to protect him,” said Owaisi.Interestingly, AIMIM is part of PDM Nyay Morcha, a front floated by former Samajwadi Party ally Apna Dal (K) which is now contesting against SP-Congress alliance. Owaisi’s praise for Mukhtar has raised eyebrows as Mukhtar’s elder brother Afzal Ansari is the SP candidate from Ghazipur Lok Sabha seat.Attacking BJP, he said that Banaras does not belong to Modi, but to Ustad Bismillah Khan, Tulsidas and Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb. He said that PDM Nyay Morcha was formed so that Dalits, Backwards and Muslims have an option in UP politics. RSS, Samajwadi Party or other political parties only talk about their justice, but they don’t implement it on the ground, he added. “I want to tell PM Modi and Akhilesh Yadav that PDM will not be limited to the limits of Parliament only.

NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party has set up a ‘ war room ’ at its headquarters on Deen Dayal Upahdyay Marg to monitor its preparations, campaigning, public meetings and events related to the May 25 Lok Sabha elections in the capital. It was launched by AAP ’s Delhi convener Gopal Rai and national secretary Pankaj Gupta.The party is contesting on four seats – East Delhi, South Delhi, New Delhi and West Delhi – while Congress, its alliance partner, has fielded candidates on the remaining three.Party functionaries said the ‘war room’ would help AAP take its poll campaign forward in a more organised manner and with greater momentum. A similar facility was set up by the party during the MCD elections in 2022.Rai said the teams at the war room would oversee the election activities in a systematic manner. Apart from appointing one coordinator each for four parliamentary constituencies, the party has set up 12 different sections, each with an in-charge for separate constituencies, to coordinate the activities on ground. The 12 sections include social media, digital media, campaign management, data management, research, logistics and legal.Rai said the party volunteers collected a lot of data from ground during its recent door-to-door and ‘Jail ka jawab, vote se’ campaigns, and the 12 teams would use this data in the third phase of canvassing that started on Saturday. AAP will now organise ‘sankalp sabhas’, which are corner meetings with the public, every day.He added that the party had also started making arrangements to help the candidates file nomination next week and necessary permissions were being taken from agencies concerned.“This time, AAP is not contesting the elections. Rather, the people of Delhi are contesting the polls and this has sent shivers down the BJP’s spine. The way the chief minister was arrested, the people of Delhi are getting ready to respond to this dictatorship and answer the arrest with their votes,” Rai said.Gupta said the party volunteers visited lakhs of houses during the door-to-door campaign and took feedback from people. “While roadshows are starting on Saturday, we have several campaigns lined up for the coming weeks. All the candidates are working in their respective fields. This time the people of Delhi will defeat BJP on all seven seats,” Gupta said.He added that heads of all teams would sit together in the war room for better coordination among them.","The party is contesting on four seats – East Delhi, South Delhi, New Delhi and West Delhi.

Other members of the CEC also supported the UP request. It was said there is a strong sentiment among workers that Rahul and Priyanka should take charge.The meeting was chaired by Kharge and attended by Sonia Gandhi, KC Venugopal, Madhusudan Mistry, Salman Khurshid, Uttam Reddy, Amee Yajnik. The CEC also discussed the pending five seats of Punjab with state president Amarinder Warring and leader of opposition Partap Bajwa.A similar plea for Rahul and Priyanka was made in the CEC meeting on March 21, and it was decided that the Gandhi family and the party brass will take a call on the issue. Sources said the proposal presented on Saturday was an updated version of what was earlier submitted to the CEC, with revised information about the “current public sentiment and party’s preparedness” on the high-profile seats. The UP unit assured the CEC that the cadres and the party unit are “all set” to launch the campaign the moment the leaders decide on contesting.Interestingly, Rahul is likely to visit Amethi on May 2 or 3, which is the last date of nomination. This has only heightened the anticipation in the party.Party leaders rate the chances of Rahul contesting very high, but uncertainty prevails over Priyanka’s electoral plunge. What is also being speculated is the party pitching Priyanka from Amethi against local MP and Union minister Smriti Irani, who defeated Rahul in 2019.While it was expected that Congress will release the list of candidates on Saturday night after the CEC meeting, sources said the suspense may linger on for a few more days.

has once again ignited a heated debate, drawing attention from various quarters, including political functionaries and National Commission for Backward Classes. At the heart of the controversy is the allocation of quotas for Muslims within the broader framework of

BJP’ s unsuccessful attempt to remove reservation

in the state. Remarks by PM Narendra Modi during a recent rally in Rajasthan have further fuelled the discussions.To comprehend the controversy, it’s essential to delve into the intricate legal, historical and political dimensions surrounding this contentious issuePM Modi, addressing a rally in Rajasthan’s Tonk-Sawai Madhopur Lok Sabha constituency, accused the Congress of attempting to diminish the quotas for SCs, STs and OBCs and of advocating reservation for Muslims contrary to the spirit of the Constitution. He cited Congress’ endeavour to introduce a 5% quota for Muslims in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh as a “pilot project” for nationwide implementation. Modi criticized the inclusion of Muslims in the OBC list in Karnataka by Congress, labelling it as a reservation along religious lines.As per data from the National Commission for Backward Classes, Karnataka has a Muslim population of 12.9%. Out of the 32% reservation for OBCs, a subcategory comprising 4% was reserved for Muslims in the state.NCBC chairperson Hansraj Gangaram Ahir said he would summon the govt chief secretary to seek clarification over the categorisation of the OBC quota, which provides for “blanket reservation” to Muslims under Category II-B.In 1975, the then state Backward Classes Commission chairman LG Havanur presented a report to the govt of D Devaraj Urs, a prominent advocate of backward classes’ interests. This report recognized Muslims as eligible for reservation, leading to their categorization under backward communities alongside other groups like scheduled castes and tribes. In March 1977, a directive was issued granting reservation to backward classes, including Muslims. Later, commissions chaired by Venkata Swamy and Justice O Chinnappa Reddy further affirmed Muslims’ status as a backward class. The classification evolved over time, with subsequent commissions like the one led by Prof Ravivarma Kumar, refining the structure. Currently, 36 Muslim communities listed in Categories 1 and 2A are included in the central OBC list, subject to non-inclusion in the ‘creamy layer’ based on an annual income threshold of Rs 8 lakh.The Reddy Commission proposed placing Muslims in Category 2 of the OBC list. In April 1994, the Congress govt, led by Veerappa Moily, endorsed this recommendation by announcing a 6% reservation in Category 2B, labelled ‘More Backward’, for Muslims, Buddhists, and scheduled caste converts to Christianity. While 4% of the reservation was allocated to Muslims, the remaining 2% was for Buddhists and SC converts to Christianity. Legal challenges arose in the Supreme Court, leading to an interim order on Sept 9, 1994, limiting overall reservation to 50%. The Moily govt collapsed on Dec 11, 1994, facing political turmoil. HD Deve Gowda assumed office as CM, and on Feb 14, 1995, he implemented the decision with adjustments as per the apex court’s interim verdict, reclassifying SC converts to Christianity and Buddhism. Under 2B quota, 4% of seats in educational institutions & govt jobs were reserved for Muslims.Before the Karnataka assembly polls last year, the then CM Basavaraj Bommai proposed on March 27, 2023, to eliminate categories 3A and 3B for OBCs. Instead, he suggested new categories 2C and 2D, with a 2% reservation each for Vokkaliga and Lingayat communities. The administration also aimed to remove the 2B category for Muslims and include them in the 10% quota for economically weaker sections (EWS). However, this sparked opposition and legal challenges, resulting in the shelving of the proposal. On April 13, 2023, the Supreme Court deemed the govt’s decision to scrap the 4% OBC quota for Muslims as “prima facie shaky and flawed”. Consequently, the Bommai govt halted new appointments or admissions based on the contentious order. The court has suspended the govt decision, maintaining the existing reservation.","At the heart of the controversy is the allocation of quotas for Muslims within the broader framework of OBC reservation.

Voter Turnout: Women’s Turnout In Polls Saw Bigger Drop Than Men’s In Both Seats Of Ncr,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/lok-sabha-elections/lok-sabha-election-news/womens-turnout-in-polls-saw-bigger-drop-than-mens-in-both-seats-of-ncr/city/ghaziabad/womens-turnout-in-polls-saw-bigger-drop-than-mens-in-both-seats-of-ncr/articleshow/109655736.cms,"(With inputs from Shafaque Alam in Noida)

GHAZIABAD: The number of women who came out to vote on Friday in the second phase of the Lok Sabha election in the two populous NCR constituencies – Ghaziabad and Noida – saw a bigger drop than the number of men exercising their ballot, which combined to trigger a sharp fall in the final turnout.In Ghaziabad, overall turnout ended lower than 50%, according to figures released on Saturday.Friday’s 49.87% turnout – the total size of the electorate is currently 29.4 lakh – is the second lowest after the first Lok Sabha in 2009, when Ghaziabad separated from Hapur as a constituency. That year, only 45.3% of eligible voters turned up to vote. In 2014, the year of the Modi wave, and 2019, as the wave continued, the turnout was 55.89% and 56.94%, respectively.Compared with 2019, the voting percentage among women in Ghaziabad fell by 6.59 percentage points this time – from 55.17% in 2019 to 48.58%. The drop in voting percentage among men was 5.33 percentage points (56.25% in 2019 to 50.92%). Ghaziabad has 13.2 lakh women and 16.2 lakh men who are registered as voters.In Gautam Budh Nagar, where 26.2 lakh people were eligible to vote, Friday’s turnout (53.66%) was the second lowest since 2009 when 48.54% people had turned up to vote. In 2014 and 2019, turnouts had climbed to and 60.33% and 60.49%, respectively.Among women in Gautam Budh Nagar, voting percentage fell from 59.55% in 2019 to 51.95% this time, a sharp 7.6 percentage point drop. Men’s voting percentage fell by 5.86 percentage points, from 60.99% in 2019 to 55.13%. Gautam Budh Nagar has 12.2 lakh women and 14 lakh men registered as voters.Was hot weather a factor? Some candidates believe it was, but not the only one. Besides, at least in urban areas, the impact of weather was offset to a large extent by voting happening inside condominiums, in the comfort of community halls and clubhouses. Data on voter turnout at the booths set up in housing societies was not available on Saturday.In the Noida assembly segment, women's turnout (46.99%) on Friday was fractionally higher than that of men (46.96%). In all other segments of Gautam Budh Nagar, it was lower. In the Sahibabad segment in Ghaziabad, it was nearly equal, women at 42.9% and men at 43%. Sahibabad is a fully urban assembly segment with most housing societies in Ghaziabad located there. Men's turnout was higher at all other assembly segments in Ghaziabad.“While hot weather conditions are one reason, the fact that voters might have preferred a long weekend and skipped their national duty to cast their vote cannot be ruled out. This is not a good sign,” said Atul Garg, the BJP candidate from Ghaziabad.His rival, INDIA bloc and Congress candidate Dolly Sharma attributed the fall in turnout to “general apathy” towards candidates. “But even if a voter is not happy with the choice of candidates in the fray, the Election Commission has introduced the NOTA option, which voters could have used to have their view registered.”BSP candidate from Ghaziabad Nand Kishor Pundir blamed the low turnout on BJP. “The current dispensation has eroded the credibility of the democratic system in the eyes of voters. There have been instances when an elected government has been replaced by a political party entering into post-poll alliances, which is an insult to the mandate of the people. So, it is natural that a section of voters has started to become cynical,” he said.Psephologist Jay Dixit said the way electoral rolls are prepared also needs to be looked into by the Election Commission. Pointing to drawbacks in the process, he said, “According to administration data, a total of 7,289 voters’ names were struck off electoral rolls on account of death, shifting or being absent. The population of Ghaziabad is 48.46 lakh. In five years, only 7,289 voters were excluded from the roll, which shows drawbacks in the system,” he said, adding electoral rolls get “inflated” because surveys don’t properly capture voter data.Political observers and some party workers felt the general conversation of these elections hasn’t been around issues that the ‘aam admi’ relates to most in their daily lives – such as cost of living, jobs, education, etc – which could have affected turnout. Hilal Ahmed, associate professor at Centre for the Study of Developing Societies, said there could be several reasons for low voter turnout. “Each party has its committed supporters, who come out to vote in an election. However, there are also non-committed voters, who may choose not to vote for various reasons. Factors such as unemployment, inflation and the performance of specific institutions can contribute to voter apathy,” he said.","In Ghaziabad, overall turnout ended lower than 50%, according to figures released on Saturday. In Gautam Budh Nagar, where 26.2 lakh people were eligible to vote, Friday’s turnout was the second lowest since 2009 when 48.54% people had turned up to vote.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109659122,imgsize-47484,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/109659122.jpg"

NOIDA: After a month of rigorous campaigning for the Lok Sabha elections , candidates finally found the much-needed time to unwind and relax on Saturday.BJP’s Mahesh Sharma, who is vying for a third term from Gautam Budh Nagar, said he had been crisscrossing the urban and rural areas of the constituency over the last few weeks and finally took out some time on Saturday to catch up with friends and well-wishers.Sharma said he was confident that there would be “no upsets” despite low turnout “due to hot weather and the ongoing harvesting season”.SP’s Mahendra Nagar also spent the day with family members at his residence in Greater Noida’s Milak Lachchi. Nagar said the poll percentage had dipped across the constituency, but it was lowest in Noida (47%) as compared to the rural assembly segments of Khurja (59.4) and Sikandrabad (60.9). “These rural segments are a party stronghold. The situation will work in my favour,” he said.BSP’s Rajendra Solanki said he had been on a hurricane campaign tour for 25 days and finally could catch his breath now. “I am confident as I received an overwhelming response in Khurja and Sikandrabad,” he said.Party’s candidate from Ghaziabad, Nand Kishor Pundir, said he was “sleep-deprived”. “The heat, dust, and the hectic campaign trail had left me with low energy. On Saturday, the first thing I did was to get some good sleep and then catch up with my family. Homemade food was another thing I missed during the campaign, and on Saturday, I felt so content devouring some,” he said. Asked whether election results played in the back of his mind, he said, “There is time to think about that. As of now, I just want to get back to my routine.”BJP candidate Atul Garg, too, stayed home and spent time with his grandchildren. “I hardly spent any time with them in the past few weeks. On Saturday, I tried to make up for the loss,” he said.Congress candidate Dolly Sharma's son was not well for the past few days, and admittedly, she had a corner of her mind occupied with the thought of her son. “I missed my children as much as they missed me, and after a long time, it was good spending time with them,” said Sharma.Campaign for the 2nd phase of the Lok Sabha polls concluded on April 25.","Campaign for the 2nd phase of the Lok Sabha polls concluded on April 25.
