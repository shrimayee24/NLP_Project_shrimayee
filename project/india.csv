THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The row over Mohanlal-starrer, ‘ L2: Empuraan ’ continued to trigger political reactions in Kerala Saturday with Congress accusing BJP of showing intolerance towards the movie citing intense criticism being raised against it on right-wing social media handles.However, state BJP functionaries chose not to make any adverse remarks against the Prithviraj-directed film, even as the party and Sangh Parivar activists continued to criticise it.The film has become a topic of hot debate over its critique of right-wing politics and covert mention of the Gujarat riots.AICC general secretary K C Venugopal alleged that BJP’s criticism of the movie was part of the intolerance of Sangh Parivar. Pointing out the recently released movies like ‘The Accidental Prime Minister’ and ‘Emergency’, he said such films were critical of Congress, but BJP welcomed all of them. “BJP should introspect whether it is right to show intolerance only when they are criticised,” he said.Venugopal added the uproar against the movie should be seen in the context of recent SC verdict quashing an FIR lodged by Gujarat Police against Congress MP Imran Pratapgarhi for allegedly posting an edited video of a provocative song. The Congress MP recalled SC’s observation that even if a large number of persons dislike the views expressed by another, the right of the person to express the views must be respected and protected.Kerala education minister V Sivankutty came out against the reported move to re-censor the film. He said Gujarat riot and Godhra were part of Indian history and generations would see and know about it whatever scissors have been used to cut it.. “Freedom of expression is cornerstone of democracy,” Sivankutty said.Meanwhile, junior minority affairs minister George Kurian said he hasn’t yet seen the movie, but will watch it.A section of right-wing outfits have demanded the revoking of Lt Col rank of Mohanlal in the wake controversial contents in the movie.",AICC general secretary K C Venugopal alleged that BJP’s criticism of the movie was part of the intolerance of Sangh Parivar.

NEW DELHI: West Bengal leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari on Saturday launched a fierce attack on CM Mamata Banerjee , calling her a "" traitor "" over her remarks during her recent visit to the United Kingdom.""Mamata Banerjee is a traitor... I have written to S Jaishankar to bring all the footage and take strict action against her. Action should be taken against the traitor,"" Adhikari said.In a letter to EAM Jaishankar, Adhikari demanded a ban on Mamata's foreign visits, alleging that she had ""deliberately tarnished India’s reputation on foreign soil.""The row stems from Banerjee’s address at Oxford University's Kellogg College, where she appeared to ""downplay"" India's economic growth. When a speaker mentioned that India had surpassed the UK as the world's fifth-largest economy and was projected to become the largest by 2060, Banerjee responded, ""I will differ that.""Adhikari termed her response ""treasonous"" and an ""embarrassment for every Bengali and Indian."" He accused Banerjee of displaying ""admiration for colonial rulers"" and urged the ministry of external affairs to investigate her statements. Citing guidelines that require MEA approval for official foreign visits, he suggested her comments should be grounds for disqualification.Banerjee’s UK visit also saw protests at Kellogg College, where demonstrators questioned her stance on election violence in West Bengal and the RG Kar College case. BJP IT Cell head Amit Malviya shared a video of the protests, criticizing Banerjee's remarks. ""West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has a problem with India becoming the world's largest economy... This is truly shameful,"" he posted on X.The Trinamool Congress has yet to respond to the allegations.","West Bengal leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari launched a fierce attack on CM Mamata Banerjee over her remarks during her recent visit to the United Kingdom.

CHANDIGARH: A special CBI court here acquitted former Punjab and Haryana high court judge Nirmal Yadav and three others on Saturday in the 17-year-old high-profile cash-at-judge’s-door case.Yadav, sitting in her car in the parking of the court complex due to a fractured leg, said she had full faith in the judiciary as the verdict came. Vishal Garg Narwana, the defence lawyer, asserted that the court decision proved that the former judge was innocent and there was no proof against her in the case. “Truth has prevailed,” he said. A copy of the judgment is awaited.The case emerged in 2008 when a bag with Rs 15 lakh mistakenly ended up at the Chandigarh residence of another judge, Nirmaljit Kaur. She called the police. The probe revealed the money was allegedly intended for Justice Yadav “to influence a decision related to a property deal”. The name of Haryana’s then additional advocate general Sanjeev Bansal also surfaced in the case.The names of property dealer Rajeev Gupta, Nirmal Singh, and Delhi-based hotelier Ravinder Singh Bhasin also surfaced in the case. The main accused, Bansal, died of an illness in 2016, during the trial, complicating matters. As the probe progressed, Justice Yadav was transferred to Uttarakhand HC and retired in 2011.The case faced several hurdles. Initially, Chandigarh police probed the matter, but within 15 days it was handed over to Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). In 2009, CBI filed a closure report, but CBI court rejected it and ordered a re-investigation. In 2011, CBI filed a chargesheet naming Justice Nirmal Yadav and several others as accused. But, the case was delayed multiple times due to legal complexities.In 2010, the then chief justice granted permission to prosecute Yadav. After receiving approval from the President in 2011, a chargesheet was filed on March 3, 2011. In 2013, the CBI court framed charges and began the trial. The Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 affected proceedings. The trial saw over 300 hearings, but frequent lengthy cross-examinations by the defence delayed proceedings.By 2024, testimony of 76 witnesses was done, with 10 witnesses retracting their statements. CBI special court reserved its judgment on Thursday.","Yadav, sitting in her car in the parking of the court complex due to a fractured leg, said she had full faith in the judiciary as the verdict came.
