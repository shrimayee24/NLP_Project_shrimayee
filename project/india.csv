'Victory for Constitution'

NEW DELHI: After the Centre on Tuesday asked the UPSC to withdraw its advertisement for lateral entry into bureaucracy , a flurry of responses poured in from both sides of the aisle. While members from the BJP-NDA heaped praises for Prime Minister Modi's move to address ""social justice"", the INDIA bloc, on the other hand, termed it a ""victory for the Constitution"" and praised Leader of Opposition for spearheading the campaign against the government's move.The Centre's decision came amid increasing criticism from both the opposition and the NDA allies.The BJP-NDA hailed Prime Minister Modi for intervening personally on the matter and making ""social justice"" a cornerstone of his policy. In his letter minister of state for personnel, Jitendra Singh said Prime Minister Narendra Modi believes that lateral entry should be in line with ""principles of equity and social justice,"" particularly regarding ""provisions of reservation.""""While most of the major lateral entries before 2014 were made in an ad-hoc manner, including cases of alleged favouritism, efforts of our government have been to make the process institutionally driven, transparent and open. The Prime Minister is of the firm belief that the process of lateral entry must be aligned with the principles of equity and social justice enshrined in our Constitution, particularly concerning the provisions of reservation.""The Union minister Chirag Paswan , who was the first leader within the NDA to voice concerns against the lateral entry scheme, was ""relieved"" and ""happy"" after the government in a surprising reversal decided to hold the move back. “I am happy that my Prime Minister Modiji understood the concerns of SC/ST and backward people. My party LJP (Ram Vilas) and I thank PM Modi,” he told news agency PTI.Union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw also hailed Prime Minister Modi for having reaffirmed his commitment to the Constitution drafted by BR Ambedkar by implementing reservation principles in Union Public Service Commission lateral entry. “PM Modi ensured that Babasaheb Ambedkar’s five sacred places are given their proper status. We are also proud that the President of India comes from a tribal community,"" Union minister told news agency ANI.The leader of opposition in Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi caustically responded to the Modi 3.0 government's reversal and said that the opposition led by the grand old party would continue to oppose ""conspiracies like BJP's lateral entry"" tooth and nail. The Raebareli MP also reiterated that they will continue to fight for social justice based on ""caste census"".""We will protect the Constitution and the reservation system at all costs. We will foil conspiracies like BJP's 'lateral entry' at any cost, "" he wrote on X, hours after the Centre's decision.Reacting to the development, Congress chief Kharge said, ""Long live the Constitution! The Congress party's fight for social justice for our Dalits, tribals, backward and weaker sections has foiled the BJP's plans to snatch away reservation."" He said it was due to the campaign run by Rahul Gandhi, the Congress and INDIA bloc parties, that the government has taken a step back.Congress general secretary in-charge communications Jairam Ramesh said on X, ""A letter from a Union minister working under a non-biological PM to a Constitutional authority without a date. What pathetic governance this is.""The other opposition leaders from the INDIA bloc heaped praise for Rahul Gandhi for defending the lateral entry advertisement and called that it a victory for the Constitution. Congress MP Manickam Tagore said that the year 2024 has given a ""weak"" prime minister and ""strong people's leader of opposition"".Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi thanked Rahul Gandhi and said that India is on a path towards dignity for all because of your steadfast commitment. Congress leader Supriya Srinate said that the cancellation of the latest advertisement for lateral entry into the bureaucracy is a ""victory"" of India's Constitution"", and added it was possible because of the opposition led by Rahul Gandhi.SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, meanwhile, said the ""conspiracy of making appointments through the back door of lateral entry in UPSC by rejecting reservation has finally succumbed to the unity of PDA"". He also hailed this a ""big victory"" and claimed the setback to have ""exposed"" the ""anti-reservation face of BJP"".BSP chief Mayawati claimed that the Centre has withdrawn the advertisement for recruitment to bureaucracy through lateral entry after her party's opposition to the move, saying that ""all such anti-reservation processes"" need to be stopped.Tamil Nadu chief minister Stalin exuded confidence that a ""strong opposition"" from the INDIA bloc was able to push the BJP led NDA govt to retract from proceeding with the recruitment process under lateral entry. The Dravidian leader also took the opportunity to harp on to his long standing call for a nationwide caste census. ""Victory for #SocialJustice! The Union Govt has withdrawn the lateral entry recruitment after strong opposition from our #INDIA bloc,"" the chief minister of the southern state wrote on X.","The Centre asked the UPSC to withdraw its advertisement for lateral entry into bureaucracy.

On a question about the Kolkata rape-murder case , Gandhi refused to comment saying he had already spoken about it and would not answer as it would distract the issue of the Dalit man's murder.""I have come here ( Raebareli ) to support the family of the victim (Dalit youth).

It's a distraction. I have done my duty of tweeting. I have done my one statement. Don't ask me this kind of attitude towards the issue that has shaken the conscience of this country.

Never,"" he added.Earlier, Gandhi had slammed the TMC-led West Bengal government and accused it of saving the accused in the Kolkata rape and murder case.Taking to X Gandhi said, ""The entire country is shocked by the gruesome incident of rape and murder of a junior doctor in Kolkata.

Opposition trumps government's lateral entry plan with quota card,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/opposition-trumps-governments-lateral-entry-plan-with-quota-card/articleshow/112663389.cms,"With SC verdict on sub-categorisation, BJP feels the need to use its political capital wisely insofar as issues of caste and quotas are concerned

NEW DELHI: The hurried cancellation of advertisement for lateral recruitment of mid-tier bureaucrats by Modi government Tuesday signals BJP's recognition of opposition 's plan to hurt it by hurling the quota card .In bringing up the issue of reservations in lateral entries, opposition had picked up from where it left off in its Lok Sabha election campaign when it turned BJP's ambition to post a 400+ score to its advantage by alleging that the bid for super majority was meant to scrap caste quotas by amending the Constitution.BJP took time to grasp the seriousness of the threat and by the time it woke up, opposition's campaign, analysis of results shows, found takers who did not consider the party's rebuttals to be convincing.This time, the party responded with alacrity.Although it strongly defended the policy over the weekend by pointing out that lateral entries date back to the days of first PM Jawaharlal Nehru, a re-think, sources indicated Monday, was already underway, with govt choosing not just to back-pedal but do one better by introducing quotas in lateral entries: something which may not sit exactly well with the objective to bring in specialists for jobs requiring special skills.The upcoming state elections in Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Haryana, each home to sizable constituencies with direct stake in quota, also appear to have weighed in with the party and the govt.With Supreme Court verdict on sub-categorisation of SCs putting the spotlight on caste census that it has opposed, BJP obviously feels the need to use its political capital wisely insofar as the twin issues of caste and quotas are concerned.The public stand taken by ally, LJP's Chirag Paswan, would have only emphasised the need for early damage-elimination. It acted with considerable speed turning down top court's recommendation for introduction of 'creamy layer' concept in quotas for SCs and STs, stealing a march over many of its opponents who were still working out their stand.It may not just be a coincidence that the advertisement for lateral recruitment came a day ahead of Bharat Bandh called by Dalit outfits to oppose top court's verdict on sub-categorisation of SCs and STs.","BJP's cancellation of advertisement for lateral recruitment of mid-tier bureaucrats signals recognition of opposition's plan to hurt it by hurling the quota card.

Political activities surge as Election Commission issues J&K poll notification,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/political-activities-surge-as-election-commission-issues-jk-poll-notification/articleshow/112662991.cms,"SRINAGAR: Political activities across J&K intensified following Tuesday’s notification by EC for the first round of the three-phase assembly elections on September 18 — following a decade-long gap and the 2019 abrogation of Article 370 and bifurcation of the region into two Union territories, including Ladakh.This round will cover 24 of the 90 constituencies — 16 in Kashmir valley and eight in Jammu division.With the notification, the nomination process has officially begun. Candidates have until August 27 to submit their nominations, with scrutiny set for August 28. The final date for withdrawal of candidature is August 30.While parties like National Conference (NC), Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Congress, and BJP remain major players, Baramulla’s independent MP Abdul Rashid Sheikh, better known as Engineer Rashid, might upend the equation.Arrested in 2019 by NIA and currently imprisoned in New Delhi’s Tihar jail on terrorism-funding charges, Rashid defeated NC vice president Omar Abdullah and People’s Conference president Sajad Gani Lone in the Lok Sabha polls .Rashid’s brother Sheikh Khurshid, a government teacher, resigned from his job to focus on the elections. “I will be working with my two nephews to make the party vibrant. We are optimistic about winning several seats. My brother’s victory in Lok Sabha elections, where he secured more than 4.7 lakh votes and defeated political heavyweights, demonstrates AIP’s growing popularity,” Khurshid said. Rashid’s sons — Abrar and Asrar — campaigned on his behalf in the Lok Sabha polls and will fill in for their father again this time.The political momentum behind Rashid’s Awami Itehad Party (AIP) has been growing lately as several politicians have defected to his side. AIP plans to field multiple candidates in both north and south Kashmir and could potentially secure several seats, positioning itself as a key player in the formation of the new govt. AIP general secretary Prince Parvaiz is the potential candidate for Bandipora.Key constituencies voting on September 18 include Pampore, Tral, Pulwama, Shopian, Anantnag East and West, and Pahalgam, predominantly in south Kashmir. In Jammu region, seats such as Inderwal, Kishtwar, Doda, and Ramban will be contested.As voting day nears, shifting allegiances and strategic alliances are likely to shape the scenario. Resignations have already hit political parties. Key figures such as Harbaksh Singh from Tral and PDP chief spokesperson Syed Suhail Bukhari left their parties Tuesday. Singh accused both PDP and NC of neglecting minority communities, while expressing hope that AIP “won’t repeat such things”.Syed Mohammad Altaf Bukhari’s J&K Apni Party has been witnessing mass resignations, with members either joining PDP, NC, or AIP. Apni Party politician Zaffar Manhas and his son are expected to join Congress during Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi’s visit to J&K for two days, starting Wednesday.Congress MP Gandhi will likely finalise a pre-poll alliance and a seat-sharing formula with NC. Though NC members had earlier dismissed any formal alliances, a party functionary said an agreement with Congress is likely, with the parties dividing seats between south Kashmir and Hindu-dominated constituencies in Jammu.After the 2023 delimitation, the new J&K assembly will have 47 legislators from Kashmir division and 43 from Jammu. According to political analysts, BJP is likely to win around 30 seats in Jammu.During the Lok Sabha polls, BJP had asked Kashmiris to vote for any candidate other than the “dynastic troika” of NC, PDP and Congress. However, the results were surprising. BJP retained two seats in Jammu but failed in Kashmir and Ladakh. NC won two of the three Lok Sabha seats in Kashmir.PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti is also gaining traction, despite losing the Lok Sabha polls to NC’s Mian Altaf in Anantnag-Rajouri. Former J&K minister Abdul Haq Khan re-joined PDP Tuesday after nearly two years away from the party.","First round of three-phase assembly elections on September 18.

JIND: In a significant development ahead of the upcoming assembly elections, khap panchayats and farmer organizations in Jind, Haryana, have come together to field their own candidate from the high-stakes Uchana constituency . The decision was made during a meeting attended by representatives from over 66 villages of the Uchana Kalan segment which is represented by former deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala .Local khap panchayats members and farmer organizations have chosen Azad Palwa as their consensus candidate. Palwa is a well-known farmer leader from Uchana, who has been actively involved in the farmers' movement against the three contentious farm laws. His candidacy is seen as a significant challenge to the traditional political parties in the fray.Uchana Constituency which will witness a high-stakes battle is considered one of the most crucial seats in the Haryana assembly elections . The seat has been a battleground for top political leaders, including former deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala, who won from this constituency in the previous election by a margin of around 48000 votes. Former MP Brijendra Singh , who recently switched from BJP to Congress, is also rumored to be contesting from this seat.The decision by khap panchayats and farmer organizations to field their own candidate is seen as a significant move to assert their influence in the political landscape of Haryana. The khap panchayats have traditionally played a crucial role in shaping the social and political fabric of the region. By fielding their own candidate, they aim to ensure that the interests of the farmers and the rural community are represented in the assembly, said a khap leader.The entry of Azad Palwa into the fray is expected to make the Uchana constituency an even more intense battleground. With the khap panchayats and farmer organizations throwing their weight behind Palwa, the traditional political parties will face a stiff challenge in winning the seat. The outcome of this election will be closely watched, as it may set a precedent for future elections in the region, said a political expert.Talking to TOI, Azad Palwa said that Dushyant Chautala and Birender's clans have deceived farmers community who took votes in the name of peasants but later sat on the lap of BJP. Both are accused of farmers and labourers who always ignored genuine demands and issues. But people of this constituency now have decided to teach a lesson to both of the clans and dynasty politics in the state. Farmers will ensure a victory from this seat this time, he added."," khap panchayats and farmer organizations in Jind, Haryana, have come together to field their own candidate from the high-stakes Uchana constituency.

A BJP statement said its president J P Nadda has appointed the two leaders as poll in-charge .Unusually, two leaders are made election in-charge together as, generally, an in-charge is joined by one or more co-incharges.As a key BJP organisational leader between 2014-2020, Madhav was deeply involved with the politics of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir and was seen instrumental in its unlikely alliance with the PDP in 2015 after the 2014 assembly polls threw up a hung verdict.He was in charge when the BJP snapped ties with the PDP in 2018.The BJP leadership's decision to bring Madhav back underlines the useful role he may play for the party in navigating the Union Territory's politics, full of fault lines and contesting narratives, and devoid of an overarching theme.Sources said the appointment also hints at the likely RSS role.Madhav was removed as BJP general secretary in 2020 and returned to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in 2021 and was made an executive member of the Hindutva organisation.He is also the president of the think tank India Foundation and is a regular contributor to opinion pages in the media.In his previous tenure in the BJP, he was one of the more visible party general secretaries who also fronted its expansion drive in the Northeast region.",RSS functionary Ram Madhav makes a return to active politics as the party appoints him in-charge for the assembly polls in Jammu and Kashmir along with Union minister G Kishan Reddy.

Seat share

What happened in the last assembly elections?

NEW DELHI: A Maharashtra opinion poll conducted earlier this week suggests that Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) will emerge as the single largest party, detailing how many seats the party is expected to win in the upcoming elections.The Matrize survey suggests that despite internal rifts and challenges within the MVA , the BJP-led alliance might have a strong showing.However, the final outcomes will depend on various factors, including voter turnout, alliance dynamics, and campaign strategies in the run-up to the elections.The Maharashtra Assembly elections are slated to take place later this year, but the Election Commission of India (ECI) has yet to announce the official schedule. While announcing polls in J&K and Haryana, the EC said it is keeping Maharashtra for later as the state is still dealing with heavy rain and has a long festive season and streak of religious events ahead. Besides, the EC added, the high requirement of forces in J&K did not leave scope for adding Maharashtra in the schedule announced on Friday.A tight race is expected between the ruling Mahayuti Alliance and the opposition's Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA). The survey also indicates that around 42 seats in the state will have a close contest.The ruling Mahayuti Alliance is composed of the BJP, Eknath Shinde's Shiv Sena, and Ajit Pawar's Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). The opposition MVA includes Shiv Sena (UBT), NCP ( Sharad Pawar ), and Congress.The Matrize survey reveals that BJP is projected to secure a 25.8% vote share.Congress is expected to follow with 18.6%, while Thackeray's Shiv Sena is predicted to garner 17.6%. Shinde's Shiv Sena is likely to obtain a 14.2% vote share. The two NCP factions are expected to have a vote share under 10%, with Ajit Pawar's faction estimated at 5.2% and Sharad Pawar's faction at 6.2%.Other parties are projected to collect 12.4% of the votes.The Maharashtra Assembly consists of a total of 288 seats. Regarding the seat share, BJP within the Mahayuti coalition is predicted to win between 95 to 105 seats. Shinde's Shiv Sena is forecasted to secure 19 to 24 seats, and Ajit Pawar's NCP wing is expected to get 7 to 12 seats.Within the MVA, Congress is likely to emerge as the largest party, with an estimated 42 to 47 seats. Thackeray's Shiv Sena is projected to win 26 to 31 seats, and Sharad Pawar's NCP faction is estimated to receive 23 to 28 seats. Other parties are expected to secure between 11 to 16 seats.This will be the first assembly election in Maharashtra with both Shiv Sena and the NCP represented by two separate factions.In the 2019 Maharashtra Assembly elections, BJP won 105 seats, while the unified Shiv Sena secured 56 seats. The combined NCP bagged 54 seats, and the Congress obtained 44 seats. Eventually, Thackeray formed the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance with Congress and NCP, and Thackeray assumed the position of chief minister.However, in June 2022, a split occurred within the Shiv Sena when Shinde, along with 39 other party MLAs, allied with the BJP, leading to the Mahayuti coalition coming to power.",The Maharashtra Assembly elections are slated to take place later this year. The Election Commission of India (ECI) has yet to announce the official schedule.

Second CM from Karnataka to face prosecution

BENGALURU: In a significant blow to Karnataka ’s 15-month-old Congress govt, governor Thaawar Chand Gehlot on Saturday sanctioned the prosecution of chief minister Siddaramaiah in relation to the alleged Mysore Urban Development Authority ( Muda ) land allotment scam.The decision prompted immediate demands from the opposition BJP-JD(S) for Siddaramaiah to step down on moral grounds, causing concern among the Congress leadership.The governor's sanction was granted under ""Section 17A of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, and Section 218 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023,"" following petitions submitted by activists Pradeep Kumar SP, TJ Abraham, and Snehamayi Krishna.The petitioners are anticipated to approach the court in the coming week. TJ Abraham, one of the complainants, expressed his intention to seek the special court for public representatives to acknowledge the governor's sanction.The controversy revolves around the alleged irregularities in the allotment of compensatory sites. At the heart of the scam is a 3.2-acre parcel of land that was gifted to the Chief Minister's wife, Parvathi, by her brother Mallikarjunaswamy in 2010.Following the acquisition of the land by Muda, Parvathi sought compensation and was subsequently allocated 14 plots. These plots are said to be substantially more valuable than the original piece of land.The opposition parties claim that the total value of the scam could potentially fall within the range of Rs 3,000 crore to Rs 4,000 crore.Karnataka's chief minister Siddaramaiah, aged 76, is facing prosecution while in office, making him the second CM in the state's history to face such charges. The first was BJP's BS Yediyurappa in 2011. Ironically, Siddaramaiah, who demanded Yediyurappa's resignation as opposition leader in 2011, now faces similar charges and growing demands for his own resignation. The current situation resembles the events of 2011.In Yediyurappa's case, the then governor HR Bhardwaj approved the prosecution on December 12, 2010, based on a petition from advocates Sirajin Basha and KN Balaraj. The sanction was granted under ""Section 19(1) of the Prevention of Corruption Act1988, and Section 197 of Criminal Procedure Code-1973."" This decision led to controversy and widespread protests by the BJP.Despite pressure, Yediyurappa did not resign immediately. He held a cabinet meeting to condemn the governor's decision and engaging in a lengthy legal battle. He eventually resigned after months of political pressure and following an indictment by the then Lokayukta Santosh Hegde in the illegal mining scandal.The sanction against Siddaramaiah adds to the list of rare but significant instances in Indian political history where governors have taken decisive actions against chief ministers. Similar scenarios have occurred in other states, such as the cases of J Jayalalithaa, AR Antulay, and Lalu Prasad Yadav, all of whom resigned following the sanction to prosecute them.","Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah is facing prosecution over the Muda scam.
