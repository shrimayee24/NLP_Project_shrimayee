Won’t share Indus waters with other states: Omar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/wont-share-indus-waters-with-other-states-omar/articleshow/121982601.cms,"JAMMU: Days after Union home minister Amit Shah declared that Indus waters will be taken to Rajasthan’s Sri Ganganagar through canals within three years, J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah on Friday opposed sharing such flows with other states.“I will never allow this (divert water from J&K to other states). Let’s use our water for ourselves first,” Omar said when asked about the Centre’s proposal for a 113-km canal to redirect surplus waters from Indus, Jhelum and Chenab to Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan.Shah had announced the canal plan in Madhya Pradesh’s Pachmarhi on June 14 against the backdrop of the Centre putting Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan “in abeyance” in the aftermath of the April 22 Pahalgam attack.Speaking on the sidelines of an outreach office’s inauguration in Jammu on Friday, Omar made it clear that he would not allow any proposal to build a canal and divert surplus water to other states. “I am not going to give approval. Let us be allowed to use our water first, then we will talk about others,” the J&K chief minister said.Among the three states mentioned in the water-sharing plan, the CM specifically questioned Punjab’s inclusion.“Why should I send water to Punjab? Punjab already has water under Indus Waters Treaty. Did they give us water when we needed it?” Omar said.Among the three states mentioned in the water-sharing plan, the CM specifically questioned Punjab’s inclusion. “Why should I send water to Punjab? Punjab already has water under Indus Waters Treaty. Did they give us water when we needed it?” Omar said. He alleged that Punjab had kept J&K waiting for years on two key projects, Ujh Shahpur Kandi. “The water of the three rivers is for us. We will use it for ourselves and then think about others,” Omar said.The CM slammed PDP president Mehbooba Mufti and People’s Conference chief Sajjad Lone for criticising his National Conference (NC) govt over high reservations in J&K, alleging the two were politicising the issue. “Where was she when she had the opportunity to raise this issue?” Omar asked. The allusion was to Mehbooba’s term as chief minister in coalition with BJP from 2016 to 2018.Omar pointed out that a cabinet sub-committee set up by his government had submitted its report on reservations and the law department was examining it.Asked if his govt would move Supreme Court to have J&K’s statehood restored, Omar expressed hope that PM Narendra Modi and the Centre would stand by their commitment on such a move. “Will see whether we have to go legally or not for statehood but till then, we are waiting for the Prime Minister and home minister (Shah) as they have assured that statehood will be restored,” the CM said.","“I will never allow this (divert water from J&K to other states) Let’s use our water for ourselves first,” Omar Abdullah said.

Ensure Muslim trader can access shop in Hindu area: HC to Gujarat govt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ensure-muslim-trader-can-access-shop-in-hindu-area-hc-to-gujarat-govt/articleshow/122014447.cms,"AHMEDABAD: Reminding state govt that maintaining law and order was its duty, Gujarat high court directed the authorities to redress the problem faced by a Muslim trader in conducting business from his legally-owned shop in a Hindu-majority locality in Vadodara.The order by a bench of Justice H D Suthar came as a relief to petitioner Onali Dholkawala, who allegedly faced relentless obstruction from locals as they have refused to let him open the premises.Dholkawala had legally purchased the shop from two Hindu brothers near Champaner Darwaza in 2016. However, he could get the sale deed registered only in 2020 after he approached HC, as the area is covered under Gujarat Prohibition of Transfer of Immovable Property and Provisions of Tenants from Eviction from Premises in Disturbed Areas Act, 1991. The Act restricts property transactions in designated areas and mandates the district collector's permission for transactions.Dholkawala continued to face opposition in the neighbourhood as some of the residents challenged the sale to a Muslim and demanded its cancellation. The residents contended that allowing a Muslim to buy property in the area could lead to polarisation and disturb demographic equilibrium.In Feb 2023, HC rejected their petition and imposed a fine of Rs 25,000 on each of the two litigants hounding the owner and ""thwarting his attempt to enjoy the fruits of the property which he successfully purchased"". An appeal against this order was also dismissed.However, the locals still did not allow Dholkawala to use the shop. They allegedly dumped debris at its gate so that it could not be opened.

VIJAYAWADA: Guntur police have found out that an elderly man and YSRCP activist, Cheeli Singaiah (65), was crushed to death by the car in which former CM YS Jagan Mohan Reddy was travelling to Sattenapalli on June 18 to visit the family of a party activist, who died by suicide a year ago.Earlier, police said a vehicle in Jagan's convoy was involved in the accident. The convoy, however, moved on and Singaiah was found dead later.The police found it was Jagan's car that was responsible for the accident, based on new video footage, which went viral on social media.After careful examination of the video, cops changed their version and said Jagan's car was involved. The police reportedly picked up the driver of Jagan's car for questioning. The accident took place when a large crowd of admirers rushed towards the convoy to shower flowers and greet Jagan.The former CM's convoy went ahead with the rally without noticing the person, who was crushed under the wheels of his vehicle. Earlier, Guntur superintendent of police Satish Kumar said Singaiah was run over by a vehicle in the convoy. It has now emerged that Singaiah was mowed down by Jagan's vehicle itself.Jagan went to Sattenapalli on June 18 to console family members of a party activist, who committed suicide about a year ago in Rentapalla village of Sattenapalli assembly constituency.A massive crowd followed Jagan's convoy throughout his trip right from his residence at Tadepalli near Vijayawada to Rentapalla village.Although the police granted permission for three vehicles and about 100 people, a large crowd gathered en route.Singaiah also participated in the rally and tried to come close to the former CM's vehicle with a view to throwing flowers on him.Guntur police have reportedly detained Ramana Reddy, the car driver of former chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, and questioned him about the accident involving his car in which an elderly person was mowed down during Jagan's visit to Sattenpalli four days ago.Police are likely to name Ramana Reddy as accused No 1 in the case. Meanwhile,YS Jagan Mohan Reddy has also been booked by the police in the case. Sources said that the police took Ramana Reddy into custody after the visual evidence showing the horrific incident in which 65-year-old Singaiah was crushed under the wheels of Jagan's car near Eturkur village.Initially, police suspected that Singiaha fell under the tyres of another vehicle. District SP Satish Kumar had also disclosed the number of vehicle which apparently caused the accident, after going through the initial evidence. After verifying more visuals, police are believed to have come to conclusion that Singaiah was run over by Jagan's vehicle. Sources said that police are also planning to alter the sections in the case based on the new evidence.Sources said that the vehicle allegedly involved was registered with YSRCP.","YSRCP activist Cheeli Singaiah (65) was crushed to death by the car in which former CM YS Jagan Mohan Reddy was travelling to Sattenapalli on June 18.

""Secularism means no discrimination against any religion. But for them, secularism means no discrimination against any religion except Hinduism,"" he said.""For atheists, it has become a habit to denigrate our gods. If this does not change it would become difficult to sustain Hindu dharma. I am not a fanatic, but I am a committed Hindu. I respect Christianity and Islam. But there should not be disrespect for Hindu dharma,"" he said.He called Pasumpon Muthuramalinga Thevar, an icon of thevars, an influential vote bank in south Tamil Nadu an incarnation of Lord Murugan, the 'world's first revolutionary leader'.Hindu Munnani and BJP leaders presented Pawan Kalyan a vel (spear).

Since the high court had directed that there should not be political speeches, all the speakers skipped political content.Though BJP's ally AIADMK chose not to speak about the Murugan conference, four former ministers from the party R B Udhayakumar, Sellur K Raju, Rajendhira Balaji and Kadambur Raju participated in the event. AIADMK general secretary Edappadi K Palaniswami had wished the conference success.
