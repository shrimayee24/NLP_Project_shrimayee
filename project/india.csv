UP BLO Deaths Trigger Outrage As Families Blame Extreme SIR Stress While Officials Deny Any Pressure

It’s for the state to ensure that employees deputed as BLOs are fit to carry out the task: SC

NEW DELHI: In a bid to calm the political slugfest over alleged suicides by BLOs due to heavy work pressure of Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls, Supreme Court on Thursday said those BLOs unwilling to do SIR work because of health or mental issues should be substituted with other govt employees by states concerned, reports Dhananjay Mahapatra.Dealing with a petition filed by a Tamil Nadu political party, TVK, alleging registration of cases against BLOs by EC when many have allegedly committed suicide due to workload, a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi said, “The state govt concerned has provided employees to do the statutorily mandated work which is being carried out by EC.”The bench said, “Can the statutorily mandated work be stopped? The states concerned must ensure that they are not posting such employees who are pregnant or having other health issues for the SIR work.”On BLOs’ selection, Supreme Court said, “EC cannot find out which employee is fit for BLO work. It is for the state to ensure that the employees deputed as booth-level officers are fit to carry out the task.”“Once the state puts the employees at the disposal of EC, they are obliged to perform the work. They are not being sent to other states as it was done on many instances in the past.If any or some of the employees are facing difficulty in carrying out the SIR work, the state must replace them,” the bench said.The court issued two directions — one, the states concerned may depute additional workforce with EC to reduce the workload on BLOs; and, second, if any employee, for a specific reason, seeks exemption from SIR work, the competent authority of the state concerned shall consider such requests on case-to-case basis and replace such employee with another employee.The bench clarified that the state is bound to provide a substitute for every employee it exempts from SIR work. “The workforce of employees put at the disposal of EC as BLOs can be increased by the states but under no circumstance it can be reduced,” the court said.Appearing for EC, senior advocate Maninder Singh said the distribution of enumeration forms have been 96% complete in Tamil Nadu and 86% in Uttar Pradesh.TVK’s counsel G Sankaranarayanan told the court EC should not register FIRs against BLOs for not meeting the target or laxity. The bench said FIRs were registered in Noida alone in UP and another FIR by Bengal police against EC by the husband of a deceased BLO. “Were there any FIR registered in Tamil Nadu,” Justice Bagchi asked.The bench said, “It is not the first time that FIRs were registered by EC against BLOs. It was done earlier too. What else can EC do? The state govt employees are not under its control. At the same time, the statutorily mandated work must be completed. Let us hope the states provide additional workforce.”Senior advocate Kapil Sibal questioned the hurry to complete SIR, the time can be extendede without overburdening BLOs.For EC, senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi said the work is going on smoothly, but some political parties are politicising the incidents to create a narrative. “Every BLO is to sign and upload approximately 30 forms a day. Is this too much of a workload,” he asked.","Supreme Court on Thursday said those BLOs unwilling to do SIR work because of health or mental issues should be substituted with other govt employees.

Shashi Tharoor Defies Congress Line, Supports Amit Shah’s Bill On Arrested PM, CM And Ministers

NEW DELHI: A parliamentary committee scrutinising the bill seeking removal of PM, CMs and ministers arrested on serious charges on Thursday unanimously resolved to ask opposition parties, which have decided not to join the panel in protest against the proposed law, to share their suggestions, sources said.The committee headed by BJP MP Aparajita Sarangi held its first meeting and, according to her, all members agreed on the need for “decriminalisation of politics”. She added that the panel would ensure “wide-ranging discussion” with all stakeholders.The constitutional amendment bill proposes that PM, CMs and ministers will cease to hold office if they are in detention for 30 consecutive days on serious criminal charges. Opposition parties such as Congress, SP, TMC and DMK have declined to the join the joint parliamentary committee, asserting that the bill can be used to target state govts for political reasons.The committee has decided to reach out to them. It will also be visiting states and speaking to different stakeholders, including leaders of opposition, the sources said. The panel will be speaking to constitutional experts and lawyers’ bodies as well.In the meeting, sources said, AIMIM MP Asaduddin Owaisi cited different criminal laws, including BNS Section 187, which allows detention of an accused for 90 days, as well as PMLA to argue against the proposed law.Another JPC, which is scrutising the constitutional amendment bill for simultaneous Lok Sabha and assembly elections met on Thursday, with Law Commission chairperson Dinesh Maheshwari, a former SC judge, endorsing the proposed law. He rejected the contention that it was against the basic structure of the Constitution and federalism. Opposition MPs, including Congress’s Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, raised questions on its provisions. The commission will be submitting its views on the queries raised by members, sources said. EC, former CJI BR Gavai, opposition MP and noted lawyer Kapil Sibal, economists Gita Gopinath and Sanjeev Sanyal are scheduled to share their views.","The constitutional amendment bill proposes that PM, CMs and ministers will cease to hold office if they are in detention for 30 consecutive days on serious criminal charges.

Watch: MPs Speak Out as SIR Row Dominates Winter Session Opening

Major changes in 20 years in voter rolls: Govt

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday told Election Commission to keep documents ready to counter the allegation by NGO Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) that special intensive revision of Bihar’s electoral rolls failed to weed out more than 5 lakh duplicate voters.For the NGO, advocate Prashant Bhushan alleged before a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi that even the duplicate names pointed out by petitioner Yogendra Yadav thro-ugh a presentation before SC in Oct continued to remain on the final voter list published by EC after completion of SIR.Displaying astonishing adamancy, EC refuses to run the deduplication software — which is in its possession — through the voter list which could eliminate the 5 lakh duplicate voters, Bhushan said, adding that the SIR exercise in Bihar lacked transparency at every stage as the commission refused to divulge details of the process it adopted to add or delete names from the final list.After hearing Bhushan, the bench told poll panel counsel Eklavya Dwivedi that “EC must respond to these factual aspects. Keep your records ready. EC is required to demonstrate that it scrupulously followed the rules and regulations set by itself for SIR”. Dwivedi said EC had filed an affidavit stating that the rules, regulations as well as the directions of SC were complied with.Bhushan said the purported exercise was to strike off foreigners and illegal migrants from the voter list, but EC was neither constitutionally, statutorily nor judicially empowered to determine a voter’s citizenship.He said if a BLO found a voter’s citizenship to be doubtful, EC could refer the case to the competent authority. Till the authority took a final decision, which was amenable to appeal before a court, EC could not remove that person from the voter list if s/he claimed in an affidavit that s/he was an Indian citizen, he said.Appearing for a petitioner, senior advocate Shoeb Alam said though the general power for conduct and superintendence of elections was entrusted to EC, the commission could not claim to possess powers beyond what was statutorily prescribed.","Supreme Court tells Election Commission to keep documents ready to counter allegation.

TN defies HC for 2nd time in 2 days on hilltop lamp ritual,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tn-defies-hc-for-2nd-time-in-2-days-on-hilltop-lamp-ritual/articleshow/125775300.cms,"BJP state chief Nainar Nagenthran (right), party veteran H Raja (centre) and other partymen being arrested in Thiruparankundram on Thursday

MADURAI: The Karthigai Deepam issue has snowballed into a major controversy in Tamil Nadu, with the state govt Thursday defying for the second time a Madras HC order allowing lighting of the lamp at Deepathoon (a stone lamp pillar) atop Thiruparankundram hills, even as a division bench of the HC rejected its appeal against a contempt order. Meanwhile, BJP state chief Nainar Nagendran and dozens of others were detained by police during protests.State govt filed an SLP in the Supreme Court challenging the division bench order, which dismissed its appeal against a single bench order on a contempt plea.Earlier in the day, the bench of Justices G Jayachandran and K K Ramakrishnan dismissed the state’s appeal, saying it was meant to preempt contempt action. The bench upheld Justice G R Swaminathan’s orders permitting lighting of the lamp at Deepathoon with CISF protection. The single bench had also initiated contempt proceedings Wednesday after the Deepam was lit at Uchi Pillaiyar Temple, not at Deepathoon atop the hill, as directed by it on Dec 1.Despite the single-bench order on Wednesday, police had prevented the petitioner and 10 others, who had been allowed to light the lamp at Deepathoon, from proceeding to the hills citing prohibitory orders.Following the rejection of the state’s appeal Thursday, Justice Swaminathan resumed the contempt proceedings, quashed the prohibitory orders imposed by Madurai district administration, and once again permitted lighting of the lamp atop the hill, this time under protection of Madurai city police. If officials defied the order, “harsh consequences will ensue”, the judge said.However, police once again stopped the individuals from proceeding, saying it would be detrimental to public order. It was a re-enactment of the scene from Wednesday at the Thiruparankundram foothills, with hundreds of BJP workers and Hindu group activists protesting against state govt, and over 1,000 police personnel deployed. BJP’s Nagendran had an argument with police before he was detained along with several others, including H Raja and Amarprasad Reddy, and about 50 cadres to prevent them from proceeding to the hills.Meanwhile, the HC division bench will on Dec 5 take up the appeals filed by Madurai district collector and executive officer of the Subramaniya Swamy temple authorities, challenging the order passed by the single bench allowing the lamp to be lit at Deepathoon.Justice Swaminathan had Monday allowed Rama Ravikumar and other petitioners to light the lamp at Deepathoon, brushing aside objections on proximity of the site to a dargah and the fact that the lamp has been lit at Uchi Pillaiyar Temple for decades.","State govt files an SLP in the Supreme Court challenging the division bench order, which dismissed its appeal against a single bench order on a contempt plea.

'We Are United...Will Go To Delhi If High Command Calls': Siddaramaiah, Shivakumar After Meeting

BENGALURU: Karnataka deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar has rejected allegations from the BJP that he failed to declare an expensive watch in his election affidavit, insisting he has been fully transparent about all his assets.Shivakumar was responding to remarks by BJP MLC Narayanaswamy, who claimed the Congress leader had omitted details of a costly watch. Speaking to reporters at Vidhana Soudha on Thursday, he dismissed the accusation outright.""What does he know? I know about my affidavit. I am the one who paid the money for the watches, and I have disclosed all the details transparently. I have also disclosed ownership of a Rolex watch. I have nothing to learn from Narayanaswamy,"" he said.When asked about Narayanaswamy’s comment that his own watch had been stolen, Shivakumar responded with a quip, ""Yes, I stole from his house!""The DKS also spoke at a convention of women employees, saying the Congress government had launched several measures aimed at women’s empowerment. ""Women are capable in all aspects today. They are a lot more disciplined than men.Our government supports the function of women's employees' organisation,"" he added.Earlier this week, during a “Breakfast 2.0” event, Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar were spotted wearing strikingly similar gold-toned watches during their joint press appearance after breakfast, sparking chatter in political circles.Those close to the pair said the watches appeared similar to the Cartier Santos De line, estimated at around Rs 43 lakh each. The matching accessories added a curious subtext to the day’s messaging on unity. Neither office commented on the watches, but they did not go unnoticed."," DK Shivakumar has rejected allegations from the BJP that he failed to declare an expensive watch in his election affidavit.
