HISAR/KOLKATA: Five men associated with a cow vigilante group have been arrested and two boys below 18 detained for allegedly beating a 24-year-old migrant worker from Bengal named Sabir Malik to death in Haryana 's Charkhi Dadri district on Aug 28. The lynching happened on the suspicion that migrant workers were eating beef in the village.CM Nayab Singh Saini condemned the crime on Saturday, saying; ""Mob lynching is unacceptable.We've implemented strict laws for cow safety and preservation. There's no compromise when it comes to protecting cows. People are very devoted, and villagers often react strongly when they hear about cow slaughter. I urge them to exercise caution and avoid such actions.""Nuh MLA Aftab Ahmed of Congress criticised BJP govt. ""There is nothing called law and order in Haryana.

His body reached his home on Friday. The West Bengal Migrant Workers Welfare Board has reached out to his family and has assured them of all help.On Aug 27, rumours circulated about migrant labourers from Assam and Bengal eating beef in Hansawas Khurd village.

Police registered a case of murder against four youths and handed the body to his family.

The other five suspects are Sahil alias Pappi, Kamaljeet, Mohit, Ravinder alias Kalia, and Abhishek alias Shaka. They are from Charkhi Dadri and Rohtak districts.

Apologisng will not compensate for the insult to Chhatrapati, it will never be enough.
