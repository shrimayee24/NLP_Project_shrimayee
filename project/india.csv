107 oppn MPs submit notice to remove Madras HC judge over lamp-lighting order,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/107-oppn-mps-submit-notice-to-remove-madras-hc-judge-over-lamp-lighting-order/articleshow/125879677.cms,"Over 100 opposition MPs have submitted a notice to the Lok Sabha Speaker seeking the removal of Madras High Court Justice GR Swaminathan. They accuse him of misconduct and bias in a recent order concerning a lamp lighting at a temple near a dargah in Tamil Nadu.

Oppn accuses Madras HC judge of showing 'undue favouritism'

As many as 107 MPs, including those from Congress, DMK and Samajwadi Party, signed the application which accuses Justice Swaminathan of misconduct, saying his functioning has raised questions over ""impartiality, transparency and secular nature"" of the judiciary.One of the grounds cited in the notice by the opposition against the Madras HC judge is ""deciding cases on the basis of particular political ideology and against secular principles of Indian Constitution"".DMK MP Kanimozhi handed over the notice to Birla. She was joined by Priyanka Gandhi and Gaurav Gogoi of Congress and Akhilesh Yadav of SP, among others.The judge is also accused of showing ""undue favouritism"" to a senior advocate and lawyers from a particular community. Supriya Sule of NCP(SP) and Asaduddin Owaisi of AIMIM were also among the signatories.At least 100 MPs are required to support a motion to remove a judge, and it is now for Birla to study the grounds on which they have sought the motion for his removal and verify the signatories before he decides on admitting the notice.The judgment has sparked a political row, with DMK raising the issue in Lok Sabha last week. Party MP TR Baalu accused BJP of trying to spark communal tensions in the state, where elections are due in a few months.Union minister and BJP MP L Murugan had hit back, accusing the state govt of denying devotees their right to worship.Baalu's criticism of Justice Swaminathan in Lok Sabha for owing allegiance to a ""particular ideology"" had drawn a sharp response from govt, with Union minister Kiren Rijiju emphasising that he cannot cast aspersions on the judiciary.Hearing a plea, Justice GR Swaminathan had on Dec 1 held that Arulmighu Subramania Swamy temple was duty-bound to light the lamp at the 'deepathoon', a stone lamp pillar located on the Thiruparankundram hillock close to the dargah.When authorities did not allow it, the single bench passed another order on Dec 3 permitting devotees themselves to light the lamp and directed Central Industrial Security Force to ensure their protection.However, the state govt did not implement the order and has moved Supreme Court challenging the verdict. The Madurai bench of the high court had last week dismissed an appeal filed by Madurai district collector and city police commissioner.","107 MPs, including those from Congress, DMK and Samajwadi Party, signed the application.

'Documents must've been forged': Court notice to Sonia Gandhi over voter fraud; Priyanka rebuts charges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/documents-mustve-been-forged-court-notice-to-sonia-gandhi-over-voter-fraud-priyanka-rebuts-charges/articleshow/125866836.cms,"""Nehru's False Sense Of Secularism"": BJP Fires Back At Priyanka Gandhi

NEW DELHI: A Delhi court on Tuesday issued a notice to veteran Congress leader Sonia Gandhi over the wrongful inclusion in the 1980-81 electoral rolls.Senior advocate Pavan Narang, appearing for the revisionist Vikas Tripathi, argued that the matter warranted reconsideration as the material placed on record indicated serious irregularities in the manner Sonia Gandhi's name was entered into the electoral roll before she became an Indian citizen.He submitted that ""certain documents must have been forged and falsified to get the name in the electoral roll of 1980,"" emphasising that her name was later deleted and then re-entered in 1983 on the basis of an application filed in January 1983, both instances, according to him, occurring before she acquired citizenship.After considering the submissions, Judge Gogne issued notice to both respondents, including Sonia Gandhi.The revision petition stems from a complaint filed by advocate Vikas Tripathi, which the Magistrate had rejected at the threshold, holding that it lacked legal foundation and relied solely on uncertified photocopies of electoral records from 1980.The Magistrate had also observed that questions of citizenship and electoral rolls fall exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Centre and the Election Commission of India, and cannot be adjudicated through a criminal complaint.Meanwhile, Congress MP and Sonia's daughter Priyanka Gandhi Vadra defended her mother claiming the allegations to be ""absolute lie""""Do they have any evidence? This is an absolute lie. She voted only after she became a citizen (of India). I don't know why they are after her, even though she is about to turn 80. She has dedicated her whole life to serving the nation. She should be spared at her age now,"" Gandhi said.The matter is now listed for further hearing on January 6, when the Sessions Court will continue examining the challenge to the Magistrate's order dismissing the complaint at the threshold.","A Delhi court on Tuesday issued a notice to veteran Congress leader Sonia Gandhi over the wrongful inclusion in the 1980-81 electoral rolls.

Pro-Muslim parties opposing clean-up of rolls: BJP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pro-muslim-parties-opposing-clean-up-of-rolls-bjp/articleshow/125877302.cms,"Cong involved in 'vote chori' since 1952, claim BJP netas

NEW DELHI: BJP MP Nishikant Dubey on Tuesday took on Rahul Gandhi over his allegation of electoral malpractices against the govt, saying EVMs were introduced by former PM Rajiv Gandhi to curb poll irregularities, and blamed ""pro-Muslim"" politics of Congress and regional parties for their opposition to SIR, as he cited disproportionate rise in Muslim population in states like West Bengal to back the exercise.Dubey rebutted Gandhi's allegations - including over ""vote chori"" and govt's decisive say in appointment of election commissioners - saying Congress put its favourite bureaucrats in poll bodies and rewarded them with berths and party tickets. As member of the selection committee, the LoP is now part of the process and can file his dissent which was never the case when Congress was in office, he said.Intervening in the discussion on election reforms in the lower House of Parliament, law minister Arjun Ram Meghwal said the special intensive revision of electoral rolls has been held multiple times since 1952 & was necessary to clean up rolls, which change due to migration and rapid urbanisation.Meghwal accused Congress of engaging in ""vote chori"" since the first LS elections, including in the defeat of B R Ambedkar. He emphasised that the Modi govt did not change the law regarding appointment of the CEC and fellow election commissioners, but created a framework following a 2023 SC ruling.Nishikant Dubey said former CEC TN Sheshan was given a Congress ticket to contest against BJP's LK Advani, while another CEC, MS Gill, became a minister in the Manmohan Singh govt after ""favouring"" Sonia Gandhi in the ""office of profit"" row.""They talk of transparency. Congress worker Batuk Singh was made UPSC chairman,"" he said.He said Parliament's select committees dating back to the 60s and 70s recommended SIR and voting machines for reforming polling process, while a joint committee that included MPs from Jana Sangh, BJP's forerunner, favoured in 1972 reducing the voting age to 18 from 21. Rajiv Gandhi implemented this in 1988, and Congress is claiming it to be the biggest polls reform, he said.Batting for SIR, he named a number of districts, including Kolkata and Murshidabad, in poll-bound West Bengal and Jharkhand, and cited 2011 Census data to flag disproportionately high rise in the Muslim population compared to their national growth since independence to claim the presence of Bangladeshi infiltrators.BJP MP Sanjay Jaiswal said Congress did ""vote chori"" by picking Nehru as PM over Sardar Patel, who was favoured by most party units, while Indira Gandhi did it by imposing Emergency.","BJP MP Nishikant Dubey says EVMs were introduced by former PM Rajiv Gandhi to curb poll irregularities.

We will change law & we will find you, Rahul warns ECs

NEW DELHI: Asking why the prime minister and home minister are so keen on deciding who becomes the election commissioner, Congress MP Rahul Gandhi Tuesday alleged that BJP has captured the Election Commission (EC) which is ""colluding"" with the governing party to help it win polls. He also accused the BJP of ""vote chori"" that, he said, is the worst possible unpatriotic act.Rahul said the Modi govt's decision to remove the Chief Justice of India from the collegium that selects election commissioners has given BJP complete control over who becomes the poll watchdog - as the three members of the collegium are PM, HM and leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi. The govt had also changed the law to give ""tremendous gift of immunity"" to election commissioners for their actions, he alleged, while EC laid down that CCTV footage be destroyed after 45 days of polling.While election commissioners got immunity, the poll commission changed the rule to lay down that CCTV footage be destroyed after 45 days of polling - decisions that, LoP Rahul Gandhi alleged, were at the root of ""vote chori"".As he targeted RSS, Rahul said the complete capture of EC was the culmination of the ""project"" executed after the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi by Nathuram Godse, referring to the education sector, intelligence agencies and bureaucracy as some other institutions.Rahul said ""our friends"" don't embrace Godse anymore because he is an ""uncomfortable truth"", but Gandhi's killing was ""not where the project ended"".Rahul presented a four-point wish list to govt for reforming the poll process: provide machine-readable voter lists to parties a month before the election, withdraw the order to destroy CCTV footage after 45 days of polling, provide opposition access to ""architecture of EVMs"" and change the law that ""allows EC to get away with what he wants to do"". In a warning that the law providing immunity to top poll officers would be no deterrent when the opposition comes to office, Rahul said election commissioners should remember ""we"" will change the law retrospectively and ""we will find you"".","Congress MP Rahul Gandhi alleges that BJP has captured the Election Commission.

"Return to ballot papers, expand collegium that picks ECs: Opposition",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/return-to-ballot-papers-expand-collegium-that-picks-ecs-opposition/articleshow/125877240.cms,"The Congress-led coalition of opposition parties is making strong demands for the reinstatement of ballot papers alongside a transformed collegium responsible for appointing election commissioners. Their criticisms target the Election Commission, claiming it has lost credibility, especially regarding electoral roll updates and those pesky model code infringements.

NEW DELHI: Accusing EC of being compromised, opposition, led by Congress, SP and DMK, demanded on Tuesday a return to ballot papers and expansion of collegium that selects election commissioners to a five-member body, comprising two LoPs, PM, home minister and CJI, as against the present composition of PM, home minister and LoP in Lok Sabha.Congress MP Manish Tewari, who opened the debate on electoral reforms in Lok Sabha, argued that if such a committee was formed, then ""theek se khela hobe"", and it will remove doubts over the credibility of EC.The all-round attack on EC and BJP was carried out by SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, DMK's Dayanidhi Maran, TMC's Kalyan Banerjee, NCP's Supriya Sule, Shiv Sena's Anil Desai, CPM's Amra Ram, RJD's Abhay Sinha, and AAP's Gurmeet Hayer, among others.Tewari and Banerjee said EC has no legal power to conduct SIR across states, and it can order such revision only in specific constituencies after recording complaints and conducting inquiries into them. Tewari also slammed the SIRs done by past govts.Akhilesh described the SIR as NRC with another name, stating the UP CM has declared that ""detention centres"" are being constructed for those weeded out of the electoral rolls.He called the SIR a hasty exercise which was launched without providing training to BLOs, citing their deaths. Training guns at EC, he alleged that the administration was misused to help BJP in past UP bypolls, but SP's complaints to EC went unheeded.Tewari and Maran demanded a return to ballot papers, as done by US and Japan. Tewari said EVMs could continue in case of 100% VVPAT counting. However, Supriya Sule refused to criticise EVMs, saying she has been voted to LS four times through the same machines. Tewari also demanded a ban on cash transfers ahead of polls, saying cash benefits were playing havoc with the exchequer while distorting the electoral landscape in favour of the governing party.Stating that erosion of people's faith in democracy leads to anarchy, he demanded that govt inform opposition if the ""source code"" of EVMs, the motherboard programme, is with EC or with the companies concerned.Trinamool's Banerjee dubbed BJP ""Bengali hater"" and asked if it will expel all Bengalis from India by calling them ""Rohingya"".Maran, targeting EC, said in 2019 and 2024 Lok Sabha polls, EC had allowed PM Narendra Modi to meditate at Kedarnath and at Vivekananda Memorial for two days each, helping him dominate TV coverage ahead of voting.Sule said EC's political neutrality is under a cloud because it has failed to curb hate speech and its enforcement of the model code of conduct is inconsistent, and errors in electoral rolls are disproportionately hurting the weaker groups.","Congress-led coalition of opposition parties is making strong demands for the reinstatement of ballot papers alongside a transformed collegium responsible for appointing election commissioners.

NEW DELHI: Key NDA constituents JDU and TDP on Tuesday accused opposition of ""double standards"" on the issue of EVMs, while another ally Shiv Sena (Shinde) made a strong demand for lowering the minimum age to contest Lok Sabha and assembly elections from 25 to 18 years and allow remote voting for migrant voters.Participating in a discussion on election reforms in Lok Sabha, Shiv Sena MP Shrikant Shinde also said EC should introduce a common electoral roll for all elections and usher in simultaneous polls for LS and state assemblies.Union minister and JDU MP Rajeev Ranjan Singh (Lalan Singh) said, ""You won in Bengal, Himachal and Karnataka, then the EVMs were correct. But in Maharashtra, Haryana or Bihar, the machines suddenly became faulty? People do not accept this double standard.""He accused opposition of trying to ""pollute the electoral system"" instead of engaging with EC's repeated clarifications.

""No one in opposition asked about 'vote chori' when Congress won in Telangana or Karnataka, but these questions only arise when results do not go their way,"" he said, dismissing claims that EVMs were manipulated.""We were hoping opposition would tell us what improvements can be made,"" he said, but added that Congress MP Manish Tewari instead ""insinuated that EC is influenced"".
