Hundreds of vehicles from different parts of Marathwada reached Sambhajinagar and started towards Mumbai via Samruddhi Super Expressway , disrupting traffic along the way. Police said this was for the first time the Samruddhi expressway witnessed a jam due to vehicles participating in a protest rally.Jaleel was calling for the arrest of Ramgiri Maharaj and Nitesh Rane, accusing them of making inflammatory remarks. He planned to deliver copies of the Constitution to members of the ruling Mahayuti and senior police officials. However, Mumbai police stated Jaleel had not been granted permission to enter the city, and barricades were put up at Mulund toll naka, a key entry point to Mumbai. There was heavy police bandobast at the toll naka and across the city and more than 3,000 cops were deployed and traffic diverted.Joint commissioner of police (law and order) Satyanarayan Choudhary, who was at spot monitoring the situation, confirmed the crowd left Monday night after handing over their letter to govt representatives. Close to 2,000 vehicles were part of the protest, an officer said, adding the rally of Muslims was also joined by vehicles comprising activists from the Dalit and Maratha communities.The first traffic snarl was witnessed on the expressway soon after the vehicles entered it through Harsul Sawangi junction from Sambhajinagar. Similar situations arose at multiple locations till the rally, which even had private buses and mini-trucks, reached Mulund naka, where the police barricaded the entry point. Not taking any chances, the Sambhajinagar police as well as the state intelligence department deputed their teams along with the rally.According to arrangements made by the Mumbai police, the cavalcade was to be stopped at Mulund naka and asked to return.While heading to Mumbai after reaching Mumbra, Jaleel said, ""We are going to Mumbai to make a representation to the chief minister and deputy CM (Fadnavis), who also holds charge of the home department. We will remind them that it is their duty to ensure that law prevails.

"'No decision taken ... ': Congress, Himachal govt firefight after minister Vikramaditya Singh announces 'UP-like' diktat for shops, street vendors",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-decision-taken-congress-himachal-govt-firefight-after-minister-vikramaditya-singh-announces-up-like-diktat-for-shops-street-vendors-to-display-ids/articleshow/113704474.cms,"Vikramaditya Singh

NEW DELHI: The Congress, which had vehemently opposed the ""display nameplate"" diktat for eateries on the route of Kanwar Yatra by BJP-led Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand governments, finds itself in an embarrassing situation with party's minister in Himachal Pradesh Vikramaditya Singh announcing a similar proposal for the state.Vikramaditya Singh, who is the state public works minister, had on Wednesday announced that it will be mandatory for all shopkeepers and street vendors in Himachal Pradesh to display their identity cards.Street vendors, especially those selling food items, will also be checked for hygiene and quality by the food supplies department, he had added. The Himachal minister defended the move citing internal security concerns, people's apprehensions and also drug menace in the state.The proposal comes in the backdrop of massive protests against the dispute over illegal construction in Shimla's Sanjauli mosque which put the spotlight on growing street vendors in the state and led to demands for a policy to identify, verify and register them. Following the incident, assembly speaker Kuldeep Singh Pathania constituted a seven-member committee of the assembly to make a street vendors policy.""The decision on ID cards was taken considering ""apprehensions"" expressed by several locals about rising number of migrants in the state,"" Vikramaditya Singh said. He had also mentioned that the decision was taken on the lines of the one taken by the Uttar Pradesh government. ""We have decided to make it mandatory for the street vendors to display their ID cards given by the street vendor's committee on the pattern adopted by the Uttar Pradesh government, which pioneered the idea,"" Singh had said.However, the move has raised a storm within the party. Senior Congress leader and former Chhattisgarh deputy chief minister TS Singh Deo has openly criticised the state government's move. ""I do not agree with the Himachal government's decision. I saw a video on social media showing crosses being marked above the shutters of minority-owned shops, indicating a boycott. This is condemnable, and if the Himachal government is doing this, questions will arise about whether it deserves to remain in power,"" Deo told news agency IANS.The Congress incharge for Himachal Rajeev Shukla said that connecting the Himachal move to Uttar Pradesh was not right. ""Vikramaditya has said that this is done to make sure only authorised persons can set up shops. The Himachal Pradesh assembly speaker has made an all-party committee to regulate hawkers and to give them licenses. Connecting this to Uttar Pradesh is not right,"" the Congress leader said.Reports say the Congress leadership is not happy with Vikramaditya going overboard with the announcements. The Himachal Pradesh government has tried to distance itself from Vikramaditya's remarks and clarified that the proposal is yet to get a cabinet nod. Shukla also presented a report to the Congress high command on the proposal, news agency ANI reported.The Himachal Pradesh government on Thursday issued a statement clarifying that no such decision has been taken.However, the BJP has been quick to latch on to Vikramaditya's announcements and not just welcomed it but has also taken credit for initiating the move during its government in the state. ""If the government is going to do this then I welcome it. There was already a street vendors policy which we had implemented but it was stopped after the Congress government came. Today we feel that it is needed, their minister himself has said this. I hope Vikramaditya Singh will stick to his word. We welcome his move,"" former Himachal Pradesh CM and LoP Jairam Thakur said.When the Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand governments had made a similar diktat during the Kanwar yatra, Congress was at the forefront opposing the order. Priyanka Gandhi had called the police directive ""a crime against Contitution.""""Creating division in society on the basis of caste and religion is a crime against the Constitution. This order should be withdrawn immediately and strict action should be taken against the officials who issued it,"" Priyanka had then written on X.Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi had criticized the diktat and accused the BJP of resorting to communal politics. ""After the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP is not able to digest its moral defeat. So it has returned to the path of communal politics. An order has come that directs shopkeepers to display their names on their food stalls in Uttar Pradesh during the Kanwar yatra, in Assam politics is going on about the population of a certain community,"" Gogoi had then said.The Supreme Court had eventually stayed the enforcement of these directives and had said that eateries should not be compelled by the police to display the names or, for that matter, the caste or religious identity of their owners or employees.",Vikramaditya Singh announced that it will be mandatory for all shopkeepers and street vendors in Himachal Pradesh to display their identity cards. The move has raised a storm within the party.

In a significant move, the Congress-led Siddaramaiah government in Karnataka on Thursday withdrew its 'general/open consent' to the Central Bureau of Investigation ( CBI ) to conduct investigations in the state.According to Section 6 of the Delhi Special Police Establishment (DSPE) Act, 1946, the CBI must obtain consent from the respective state governments to conduct investigations.Karnataka law minister HK Patil said: ""We are withdrawing open consent for CBI investigation in the state. We are expressing our concerns about the misuse of the CBI. In all the cases we have referred to the CBI, they have not filed charge sheets, leaving many cases pending.

However, the BJP is being allowed to protest, but we are being denied permission to cleanse Vikasa Soudha,"" Manohar said.Earlier, the Karnataka government ordered a probe by SIT against Munirathna.He was first taken into custody for allegedly threatening a contractor and violating the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.Subsequently, a woman social activist filed a rape complaint against Munirathna at the Kaggalipura Police Station in Ramanagara district on Thursday, leading to the registration of an FIR.According to the complaint, the victim was taken to a godown owned by Munirathna in Mutyalanagara, where she was allegedly raped. The complainant further stated that the act was recorded, and Munirathna threatened her, saying, ""if the matter came out, she would be dealt with severely"".The woman also alleged that she was coerced into setting up honey traps at various private resorts. In her complaint, she claimed, ""The BJP MLA forced me to carry out honey traps. He had threatened me with life to get this job done.""The woman also accused Naidu's six associates, including his gunman, of assisting him in blackmailing and threatening her with obscene videos that Naidu himself recorded.

NEW DELHI: With just days left for Haryana polls , Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday sought to enthuse the BJP cadre saying that the party would get a third term in the state as people realise that its two previous ones marked a break from the corruption which had become the hallmark of the Congresss decade.""The youth of the state are getting employment without 'kharchi' or 'parchi', this has happened for the first time in Haryana.Therefore, the people of Haryana are with us, their blessings are with us, and victory is certain,"" the Prime Minister said in a virtual "" Mera Booth Sabse Majboot "" event. Suggesting that national interest should be paramount, the PM explained the attitude workers should have while working on the ground, as he said, ""I shall not let BJP's flag go down, I will work hard, I will motivate voters to vote, I will build a strong voters' base from my booth.""The pep talk is seen as significant from the point of view of the party brass's task to convince the cadre they should not succumb to the perception about Congress heading for a comfortable victory in the state. BJP has learned from the mistake it made in Delhi Municipal Corporation polls when it allowed itself to be persuaded by the dominant view of AAP scoring a landslide. In the event, it turned out to be a close finish and left the party regretting that it did not even try to put up a fight.PM Modi once again hit out at Congress, which, he said, spends most of its time infighting. ""Every child in Haryana is aware of it,"" said the Prime Minister as he asserted that people have decided to give one more chance to BJP to serve the state. He said, ""The entire basis of those fighting against us in the polls is lies. They repeatedly tell lies, their talks have no head or tail and they vitiate the atmosphere.""""Some are saying the Congress is becoming weak each day.

Congress is not concerned about anyone else's children. To get votes, Congress in Himachal Pradesh made promises that they would make golden roofs for every house and then after forming the govt, they gave up. Today, the Congress govt in Himachal is unable to pay the govt employees, is unable to do any development work, is unable to make govt recruitments. Schools, roads, electricity, water, hospitals, everything is at a standstill.""He outlined key strategies to ensure success in upcoming polls focusing on voter outreach , digital engagement, and community-driven initiatives.

"Vote for ‘dynastic’ NC-Congress, PDP to serve Pakistan’s intentions in J&K: Amit Shah",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/vote-for-dynastic-nc-congress-pdp-to-serve-pakistans-intentions-in-jk-amit-shah/articleshow/113713608.cms,"Amit Shah (PTI photo)

JAMMU: Union home minister Amit Shah cautioned Thursday that electing candidates from the NC-Congress alliance and PDP in the ongoing J&K assembly elections would play into Pakistan’s hands. “If they get elected, Pakistan will celebrate,” he said, addressing a BJP campaign rally at Chenani in Udhampur district for the third and final phase of polling on Oct 1.Alleging that the three “dynastic” parties are responsible for 40 years of terrorism in J&K, during which he said 40,000 people were killed and 3,000 days were lost to bandhs and curfews.Shah said PM Narendra Modi’s government has brought down terrorism-related violence, but NC and PDP seek to revive it. “Whatever be your wish, terrorism will be eradicated forever from Kashmir. I want to tell (NC vice president) Omar Abdullah that despite his desire, we will bury terrorism deep down under the earth and it will never come back,” he said. “There is only one symbol to eradicate terrorism. That symbol is lotus.”These are the first assembly elections in a decade in J&K and since the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019 and the subsequent bifurcation of the region into two Union territories, including Ladakh. “In the first two phases, NC-Congress has been completely wiped out. On October 8, a strong BJP government will be formed under the leadership of Modiji,” Shah said.The Union minister said the Modi government had fulfilled the dream of BJP patriarch Syama Prasad Mookerjee by removing Article 370, in line with the latter’s famous slogan: “Ek desh mein do vidhan, do pradhan, aur do nishan nahi chalenge (There cannot be two constitutions, two PMs, and two flags in one nation)”.On reversing J&K’s status from UT to state, Shah reaffirmed: “I had said in Parliament that after the elections, we will restore J&K’s statehood. Modiji also said this. Only Parliament can give J&K statehood, and Modiji is the leader of Parliament.”Shah also responded to Congress MP Rahul Gandhi’s remarks on restoring Article 370. “I tell Rahul baba, even if his three generations fight for it, Article 370 will not come back. Rahul baba, it is because of Jawaharlal Nehru’s mistake that today PoK is with Pakistan,” he said.Referring to Gandhi’s recent jibe at lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha, whom he described as “king”, Shah said: “Rahul baba is saying outsiders are governing J&K. Those guiding him might not be well-versed with history because the longest tenure of central rule in the region had happened during the tenure of his grandmother (Indira Gandhi) and father (Rajiv Gandhi).”Shah accused NC chief Farooq Abdullah of allowing terrorism to flourish during his tenure as CM. “They kept terrorism alive, cinemas were closed, and when Farooq Abdullah was CM, terrorism grew. Instead of fighting it, he left Srinagar for holidays in London,” he said.He criticised Farooq Abdullah’s remarks about the Army’s presence in J&K, asserting that the people would respond to the former CM, who had described soldiers as “accomplices of terrorists”.The Union minister referenced Omar Abdullah’s earlier comments about the hanging of 2001 Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru, asking: “Phir kya, usko biryani khilani thi? (Then what, should we have served him biryani instead?).” He also took aim at NC’s promise to release youth from jails, accusing them of wanting to free “terrorists and stone-throwers” and assuring that strong laws would prevent this.Shah accused the three political “dynasties” of holding democracy hostage for 70 years. He lauded BJP for bringing grassroots democracy through panchayat, block development council (BDC), and district development council (DDC) elections in J&K. “These three families gave you 87 MLAs, we gave you 40,000 elected representatives through panchayat, BDC, and DDC elections,” he said.Shah also celebrated recent events in Kashmir, saying that while “it was once a struggle to hoist the Indian flag in Lal Chowk, every house in Srinagar has a Tricolour now”. He added that after 40 years, “Muharram and Janmasthami were celebrated in Srinagar”.Shah also addressed rallies in Udhampur, Bani, Jasrota, and Madh during the day. The final phase of elections will cover 40 assembly seats in seven districts — Jammu, Udhampur, Samba, and Kathua in the southern parts of the UT and Kupwara, Baramulla, and Bandipora in north Kashmir. Votes will be counted on October 8.","Union home minister Amit Shah cautioned that electing candidates from NC- Congress alliance and PDP in the ongoing J&K assembly elections would play into Pakistan’s hands. “If they get elected, Pakistan will celebrate,” he said, addressing a BJP campaign rally at Chenani in Udhampur district.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113713584,imgsize-930757,width-400,resizemode-4/113713584.jpg"

Her call comes amidst concerns from local leaders who accused that the delay in opening the Metro line is politically motivated.During a press conference, Sule expressed her regret over PM Modi 's cancelled visit to Pune, which was postponed due to heavy rainfall in the city.""It is very unfortunate that we have missed PM Modi's visit. It is Maharashtra's culture to welcome a guest,"" she said.Sule highlighted that this would be the sixth occasion for the Prime Minister to inaugurate the Pune Metro project, adding, ""So I request the PM to inaugurate Pune Metro online. It will help the people of Pune city, and the inauguration must not wait for the next visit of the PM.""Pune NCP (SP) chief Prashant Jagtap alleged that the Metro route has remained closed despite being fully operational, as the government waited for PM Modi's presence for the inauguration. Jagtap criticised the government's decision, asserting that the Metro line between the civil court and Swargate is ready for public use.Jagtap issued a decisive warning too, saying that if the government does not open the Metro line for public use, leaders from the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), which includes the Shiv Sena (UBT) and Congress, will inaugurate the underground Metro corridor at 11 am on Friday. ""The Metro line between Civil Court and Swargate is ready to be opened for the public, but it has been kept closed as (they) were waiting for PM Modi to inaugurate it,"" he said.PM Modi was scheduled to flag off the Metro train connecting the district court to Swargate and inaugurate several projects valued at over Rs 20,900 crore. However, due to inclement weather, these plans were disrupted.Sule also commented on the broader political context, questioning the BJP's focus on targeting prominent leaders such as Sharad Pawar and Uddhav Thackeray during Union minister Amit Shah 's recent visit to Maharashtra, rather than serving the public.She noted the ""coincidence"" of Sharad Pawar receiving an Enforcement Directorate notice on the same day five years ago, implying a pattern of political targeting leading up to elections.When asked about recent trips to the United States by both PM Modi and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, Sule remarked on the historically strong India-US relations, which she attributed to former PM Manmohan Singh's groundwork during Barack Obama's presidency.","NCP (SP) leader Supriya Sule urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday to inaugurate the new phase of the Pune Metro through an online ceremony.

Sisodia's remarks came in response to an order from Delhi LG VK Saxena, directing the immediate completion of the election for the final member of the MCD Standing Committee by 10 pm.""Tonight, on the orders of PM Narendra Modi, the BJP is killing democracy in the Delhi Municipal Corporation,"" said Sisodia. He alleged that the BJP had prior knowledge of the LG's directive and had strategically kept its councillors in the MCD House while AAP and Congress members were absent.Sisodia also criticised the sudden nature of the directive, stating that Mayor Shelly Oberoi had already adjourned the House until October 5 due to chaos during the election process. ""The Mayor adjourned the House till October 5, but at 8:30 pm, the Delhi LG, from America, wrote a letter to the MCD Commissioner, demanding the election be completed by 10 pm,"" he added.Meanwhile, Delhi LG VK Saxena had instructed MCD Commissioner Ashwani Kumar to ensure that the election for the 18th Standing Committee member was completed by 10 pm. The directive also stated that in the Mayor’s absence, the Deputy Mayor or the senior-most councillor should preside over the meeting.However, MCD at 10:20 pm stated that ""the standing committee election for sixth member will not be held today (Thursday). The date and time of the election will be intimated later.""The controversy erupted earlier in the day over the ban on mobile phones in the MCD House, which sparked protests from AAP councillors. The phone ban, implemented to ensure the secrecy of voting, led to a heated confrontation between AAP councillors and the police, with AAP members refusing to enter the House unless allowed to bring in their phones.Meanwhile, Delhi BJP President Virendraa Sachdeva on postponing the MCD Standing Committee election, said, "" AAP, Arvind Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia are murdering the democracy...you won the election and formed the govt, you have the majority still you are not letting the MCD elections take place...this year a Dalit mayor is supposed to be elected and they are trying to take away the right of Dalit...why are you running away from elections?...they don't trust their own councillors.""Union Minister Harsh Malhotra also said that, ""They themselves postponed the election...Manish Sisodia is right, democracy is being murdered but he is not saying the fact that Mayor herself has murdered the democracy by stopping the election...against whom will they move legally? Mayor?""MCD Mayor Shelly Oberoi, who had initially entered the House at 2:25 pm, expressed frustration with the situation and adjourned the meeting three times. She cited the insult to councillors and lack of cooperation from officials as the reasons for postponing the session until October 5.""The councillors have been insulted and nowhere in the country are corporators treated like this in any municipality. I must say there is pressure on the officials as well,"" Oberoi stated, before postponing the meeting.Outside the MCD House, AAP councillors staged a protest, accusing the BJP and Municipal Commissioner of acting under pressure. Meanwhile, BJP councillors, having completed security checks, were present in the House on time and participated in the proceedings without any issues.Of the 18 Standing Committee seats, 17 have already been filled, with eight members from AAP and nine from BJP. The formation of the Standing Committee is crucial as it holds authority over key financial decisions that have been pending for over 20 months.Municipal Secretary Shiva Prasad KV defended the ban on mobile phones, stating that under rule 51 (5) of the DMC Act, the prohibition was necessary to maintain the secrecy of voting, but that phones would be allowed after the voting process was completed.",Former Delhi deputy CM and AAP leader Manish Sisodia launched a scathing attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP.
