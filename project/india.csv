NEW DELHI: The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Saturday expressed shock over the reports that lieutenant government (LG) VK Saxena had given the Enforcement Directorate (ED) approval to prosecute party chief Arvind Kejriwal in a liquor policy case , with the rival BJP calling the former Delhi CM ""kingpin"" of the ""scam"".Fresh trouble mounted for AAP convenor Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday when LG Saxena gave his sanction to the ED to prosecute Kejriwal in a case that has trapped the party in a legal labyrinth for the past few years The central investigating agency sought Saxena's nod to prosecute Kejriwal earlier this month after it allegedly found a ""huge level of corruption in framing and implementation"" of the excise policy, which was mentioned in prosecution complaint no. 7 filed in the Rouse Avenue court on May 17 this year.The court took cognisance of the complaint on July 9.Reacting to the development, Delhi health minister Saurabh Bhardwaj expressed shock over the reports and claimed there was no prosecution sanction issued in this regard.""I am shocked...don't they have the basic knowledge that prosecution sanction is required to prosecute a chief minister or a minister? They are saying that today they have given sanction to prosecute (Arvind Kejriwal), what was the BJP doing for the last two years? If they did not have permission to prosecute (Arvind Kejriwal), what were they doing? We have information that there is no prosecution sanction today also. This is part of a conspiracy being pushed for political reasons,"" Bhardwaj told news agency ANI.Another senior AAP leader Sanjay Singh called the reports on Kejriwal's prosecution ""fake"" and asked LG Saxena to make the letter public.""This fake news has been circulating since the morning. I don't know what is the source of this information. If Delhi LG has given any sanction, then he should make it public. Where is that letter of the sanction? If the ED (Enforcement Directorate) has been given the nod to prosecute (Kejriwal), the LG should show the letter. It is important to have evidence before running such baseless news. Delhi LG has given no such letter,"" Sanjay Singh, who is AAP Rajya Sabha MP, told ANI.Meanwhile, Delhi Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) President Virendra Sachdeva accused Kejriwal of being the ""kingpin"" of Delhi's liquor scam and stated that the ex-CM would be punished for his alleged involvement in the excise policy case.""It is clear that Arvind Kejriwal is the 'kingpin' of the Delhi Excise Policy scam and he has looted Delhi. We have been saying this since the first day that once you are out on bail, it is not evidence of your innocence. As the investigation progresses, Arvind Kejriwal is the culprit in this and will be punished,"" Delhi BJP President Virendra Sachdeva told ANI.On Friday, the Delhi high court granted the ED additional time to file its reply to the petition filed by Kejriwal and former deputy CM Manish Sisodia, challenging the trial court's decision to take cognisance of the chargesheets in the Delhi excise liquor policy case.The matter has been scheduled for hearing on February 5 by the bench of Justice Manoj Kumar Ohri.","LG VK Saxena gave his sanction to the ED to prosecute Kejriwal in a case that has trapped the party in a legal labyrinth.

NEW DELHI: The confrontation in Parliament over Ambedkar took an ugly turn Thursday as BJP and Congress MPs came face to face at the entrance of the new Parliament while accusing each other of insulting the Dalit icon.BJP's Lok Sabha MP Pratap Sarangi suffered a cut on his forehead and was taken to hospital along with colleague Mukesh Rajput. Both accused leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi of shoving his way through BJP MPs standing at the main entrance, Makar Dwar.Later, both sides filed complaints against each other. PTI reported, quoting sources, that LS Speaker Om Birla had banned demonstrations at any of the Parliament gates.The scuffle happened minutes before 11am when the two Houses were to gather for what would have been another stormy round. A big group of BJP MPs had gathered at the entrance to protest against Congress's alleged insult of Ambedkar. As Rahul reached, he decided to walk through the saffron column.Soon, Sarangi was seen tumbling and bleeding. He was also hurt in the knee. The 70-year-old MP from Balasore in Odisha, and his colleagues, said he suffered the injury after Rahul shoved Rajput who was standing next to him, bringing both of them down.Kya Rahul, kya? Aap ko sharam nahin aati hai, budhe ko gira diya (What Rahul, are you not ashamed of what you have done to an elderly member)?” BJP MP Nishikant Dubey was heard repeatedly shouting at Rahul as the Congress MP paused to look at Sarangi and Rajput.“What happened? I did not push him, he pushed me,” Rahul replied.Amid the welter of allegations and counter-allegations, Sarangi with a bleeding temple, and Rajput were rushed to RML Hospital. As doctors stitched Sarangi’s wound and ran a series of scans on him, defence minister Rajnath Singh and agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and others visited the hospital to check on them. PM Modi spoke with the two MPs. In a statement, RML Hospital said Sarangi was profusely bleeding when he was brought in.With BJP accusing Rahul of physical violence and goonish behaviour, Congress members wrote to LS Speaker Om Birla alleging that the LoP had been manhandled by three BJP MPs.They also alleged that BJP MPs had shoved party chief Mallikarjun Kharge.Ministers and BJP MPs, however, pressed with the charge that Rahul was the instigator. They said that faced with similar protests from Congress MPs who have been regularly blocking the entrance on a range of issues for years, BJP parliamentarians would take the passage created by security personnel to help them sidestep the opposition MPs.At a press conference later, Kharge said BJP was trying to divert attention from home minister Amit Shah’s remarks on Ambedkar.Both Houses were adjourned soon after they assembled, and then again at 2pm for the day when Congress and other opposition parties continued their protest demanding an apology and resignation of home minister Amit Shah.Speaking to reporters, parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju said, “BJP MPs were protesting outside the Parliament gate where Rahul Gandhi with a few of his MPs physically assaulted them, who were peacefully protesting against falsehoods being spread against Amit Shah on the Ambedkar issue.”He said the entire incident was recorded on CCTV cameras and everyone saw that Rahul physically attacked NDA MPs.","BJP's Lok Sabha MP Pratap Sarangi suffered a cut on his forehead and was taken to hospital along with colleague Mukesh Rajput.
