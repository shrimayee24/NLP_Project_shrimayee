NEW DELHI: The conspicuous absence of affirmation from the BJP top brass on ally Nitish Kumar's chief ministership ahead of the upcoming Bihar assembly polls has led to out-of-sync statements from both the BJP and the JD(U).While Nitish's party has dug its heels on the CM post, Haryana counterpart Nayab Singh Saini's remark that NDA would win the Bihar poll under BJP's Samrat Choudhary raised eyebrows on Monday.As Saini's statement triggered flutter in the poll-bound Bihar, the JD(U) leaders rolled up their sleeves on Tuesday to assert Nitish as CM for the next five years.Blunting the opposition's charge of the BJP outsmarting the Nitish, national spokesperson Rajeev Ranjan Prasad dismissed the Haryana CM's comment and asserted that the ruling alliance faces no crisis over its chief ministerial face in Bihar.Prasad said, ""The Bihar assembly elections will be held under the leadership of Nitish Kumar, and he will be the face of the National Democratic Alliance. Chief minister Nitish Kumar will head the NDA government, which is certain to be formed after the elections for a full term till 2030.""Nitish Kumar's son Nishant Kumar also appealed to Bihar voters ""to give a majority (to JDU) more than what they gave in 2010... Nitish Kumar will undoubtedly become the CM"".Samrat Chaudhary, who is Bihar's deputy CM, expressed that Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is going to retain his post after the Bihar Assembly elections even if the ""entire UPA, INDI alliance"" fights the polls.""There is no challenge. Even if the entire UPA and the entire INDI alliance fight, Nitish Kumar will remain the chief minister of Bihar,"" Samrat Chaudhary told ANI in Patna.The BJP has made it clear on several occasions that the Bihar election will be fought under CM Nitish Kumar but has remained mum on whether he would be the CM for five years after the NDA victory.Meanwhile, as the uncertainty shrouds Nitish's chief ministership, Congress and the RJD huddled at Malikarjun Kharge's house to pan out an alliance in the state.The meeting was also attended by Congress' Rahul Gandhi, party's general secretary (Organisation) KC Venugopal and others. On the RJD side, Tejashwi Yadav , MP Manoj Jha, MP Sanjay Yadav and other leaders were present.Following the meeting, Tejashwi said that another round of discussions would take place between the two parties in Patna.“Congress and RJD will sit in Patna to make the strategy. We are committed to taking Bihar on the path of progress,” Tejashwi said.“The government has been in place for 20 years in Bihar, with PM Modi at the helm for 11 years. Despite all this, Bihar remains the most economically backward state, with the lowest per capita income, lowest farmers' income, and the highest migration,” he added.",JD(U) leaders rolled up their sleeves on Tuesday to assert Nitish as CM for the next five years.

PATNA/NEW DELHI: Congress and RJD decided to fix a timeline to clinch the nitty gritties of electoral alliance early, with the leadership of the two parties kickstarting the talks for Bihar polls on Monday.RJD neta Tejashwi Yadav , accompanied by MPs Manoj Jha and Sanjay Yadav, visited Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge for discussions that included Rahul Gandhi, AICC general secretary K C Venugopal and Gurdeep Sappal.The allies will meet again in Patna Thursday, where, sources said, they are likely to fix the schedule for finalising the seat-sharing formula, campaign plan and manifesto points. Well-placed sources said the parties expressed concern that delay in seat sharing not only puts electioneering on hold, but also embitters the cadres and hurts coordination. The focus of the 2025 polls is likely to be on joint campaigning.The sources said seat-sharing will, in all probability, be clinched by May-end. ""It is the only ticklish part. Else, we have no differences of manifesto or leadership. The speculation about the CM face of the Mahagathbandhan is also laughable as everybody knows who leads the alliance. Just to underline, Tejashwi has called the meeting to be held on Thursday,"" a Congress functionary said.RJD is said to have argued that allies should make realistic demands on seats instead of just seeking a higher tally. It is felt that Congress may focus on quality of seats instead of numbers.Tejashwi said the talks were positive and the CM face of the Mahagathbandhan will be decided amicably.","Congress and RJD decided to fix a timeline to clinch the nitty gritties of electoral alliance early.
