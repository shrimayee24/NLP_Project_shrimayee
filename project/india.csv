"Amid talk of Thackerays reunion, MNS 2nd rung recalls hostilities",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amid-talk-of-thackerays-reunion-mns-2nd-rung-recalls-hostilities/articleshow/120467966.cms,"MUMBAI: A day after estranged cousins Raj and Uddhav Thackeray hinted at a possible patch-up between their parties, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena and Shiv Sena (UBT), there were already rumblings from party workers.Speaking to the media Sunday, MNS’ functionary Sandeep Deshpande asked whether Uddhav would apologise for the 17,000 cases lodged against MNS workers when he was CM and pointed out that he had rejected an olive branch from MNS in 2017. “The parties should not come together just for elections but there are larger issues affecting Marathi people ,” he added.In response, Sena (UBT) spokesperson Sanjay Raut pointed out that Deshpande was a party functionary and the words of Raj Thackeray would prevail. “Raj Thackeray made a statement and Uddhav Thackeray welcomed it. What someone else says is not relevant. Everything is for the good of Maharashtra but those who are anti-Maharashtra should not be entertained. We have not given pre- conditions. Raj Thackerary knows who is anti-Maharashtra.”Raj’s frequent overtures to BJP are likely to remain a sticking point with Uddhav’s party which had a bitter parting from its former ally. “Both Raj and Uddhav spoke about the good of Maharashtra. BJP does not fit into this formula. Nor do those who support it. This is not a pre-condition but the sentiment among people,” Raut added.Naresh Mhaske from Eknath Shinde’s Shiv Sena, meanwhile, dismissed the possibility of a patch-up and said, “When Raj was in the party, Uddhav did not want to give him responsibility and did not want him to visit shakhas. How is he going to include him now?”Industries minister Uday Samant from Shiv Sena also dismissed the possibility of a reconciliation. “Raj is an independent thinker and he is unlikely to respond to riders and pre-conditions,” he said.","MNS’ functionary Sandeep Deshpande asked whether Uddhav would apologise for the 17,000 cases lodged against MNS workers when he was CM. “The parties should not come together just for elections but there are larger issues affecting Marathi people,” he added.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120467963,imgsize-1145334,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Poll Is the political climate in India becoming more polarized? No Yes

NEW DELHI: Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav stirred the pot with a claim about the Maha Kumbh of this year, suggesting that it was part of a BJP plot to present Yogi Adityanath as the Prime Ministerial candidate.Addressing the media in Prayagraj, SP supremo said, ""It is being heard that during the Maha Kumbh, it was their plan to announce his (CM Yogi Adityanath) name as the Prime Minister's face. They wanted to make this a political Kumbh. This was not a religious Kumbh.""Yadav didn’t stop there. He targeted the saffron party, accusing it of fostering division in society. ""The truth is that if anyone is creating rifts between religions, then it is the BJP. Creating a divide in society in the name of religion, caste is a very well-planned programme of the BJP, and they spend funds on it. Whatever was said is the thinking of the BJP,"" he said.His comments came on the heels of the heated political row surrounding BJP MP Nishikant Dubey's remarks about the Supreme Court.Dubey had alleged that the apex court was ""inciting religious wars"" and questioned its authority, suggesting that Parliament should shut down if the judiciary was to make laws.""The top court has only one aim: 'Show me the face, and I will show you the law'. The Supreme Court is going beyond its limits. If one has to go to the Supreme Court for everything, then Parliament and the State Assembly should be shut,"" Dubey said.The BJP, meanwhile, distanced itself from Dubey’s statements, with party leaders asserting that these remarks were personal and not aligned with the party's position.",Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav claims BJP wanted to present Yogi Adityanath as Prime Ministerial candidate.
