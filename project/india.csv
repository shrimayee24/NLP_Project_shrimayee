NEW DELHI: Parliament on Thursday passed the Bharatiya Vayuyan Vidheyak, 2024 — a bill that replaces the Aircraft Act, 1934 — to improve ease of doing business in the fast-growing aviation sector.The bill was passed by voice vote in Rajya Sabha on Thursday. It was approved by Lok Sabha in the previous session in Aug.The debate on the bill in RS saw the name of the legislation in Hindi become a point of heated discussion with members of certain opposition parties objecting to it. BJP netas refuted the charge, alleging that the reaction of the opposition members reflects their “colonial mindset”.YSRCP’s S Niranjan Reddy asked govt to reconsider the nomenclature of the bill and said he was saying so not because he is opposing “Hindi imposition” but because there is a constitutional requirement. CPI’s Sandosh Kumar P also demanded that the title of the bill be amended, claiming that it is in contravention of the Constitution. TMC’s Sagarika Ghose and DMK’s Kanimozhi NVN Somu also opposed the bill’s name.Replying to the debate, civil aviation minister K Rammohan Naidu said there was no violation of any Constitutional rule in the change in title of the bill from English to Hindi. He added that it was done to “showcase India’s heritage and culture”.Responding to concerns of some MPs over skyrocketing airfares, Naidu said, “Through the Udan scheme, we have kind of addressed the accessibility. We are now addressing the affordability factor.” He said under the scheme, 609 routes were started in eight years.",The bill was passed by voice vote in Rajya Sabha on Thursday.

NEW DELHI: Amruta Fadnavis , wife of Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, credited her husband’s political success to his patience and perseverance as he assumed office as CM for the third time following the BJP’s landslide victory in the Maharashtra assembly polls.""Patience and perseverance are the main qualities that have taken Devendra Fadnavis to where he is,"" she told reporters on Thursday, expressing happiness at his sixth consecutive term as an MLA and his third stint as chief minister. However, she stressed the heavy responsibility of fulfilling the government’s mandate.Fadnavis, who previously served as CM from 2014 to 2019, had famously coined the slogan "" Me Punha Yein "" (I will come back again) during the 2019 assembly elections. Despite securing 105 seats, the BJP’s fallout with the Shiv Sena kept him from reclaiming the top post, though he briefly held an 80-hour term with Ajit Pawar as deputy.He faced further challenges in 2022 when the Maha Vikas Aghadi government fell, and Eknath Shinde took the chief minister’s position, relegating Fadnavis to the deputy CM role. His ""Me Punha Yein"" slogan became a source of mockery during these years.Finally, the BJP emerged triumphant in the recent elections, winning 132 seats and bringing the Mahayuti alliance back to power with a commanding majority in the 288-member assembly.Reflecting on this victory, Amruta Fadnavis said, ""He wanted to come back to work for the welfare of Maharashtra.""","Amruta Fadnavis credits her husband's political success to his patience and perseverance.

Ambitions vs reality

A family rift and a costly gamble

From cooperative politics to state leader

The road ahead

NEW DELHI: In a career marked by dramatic turns, NCP chief Ajit Pawar has once again proven his resilience by becoming Maharashtra’s deputy chief minister for the sixth time. Taking the oath on Thursday at a grand ceremony in Mumbai, the 65-year-old leader fortified his position in state politics, stepping out of the shadow of his uncle, NCP founder Sharad Pawar , more than a year after rebelling against him.A seasoned politician, Ajit Pawar has never hidden his desire to become the chief minister. Yet, the title continues to elude him, earning him the moniker ""forever Deputy CM"" among detractors. Despite such jibes, his political maneuvering since 2019 has solidified his role as one of Maharashtra's most adaptable leaders.Reflecting on the leadership reshuffle, political analyst Suhas Palshikar observed, ""Ajit Pawar's survival instincts are unparalleled. Even when cornered, he has an uncanny ability to turn challenges into opportunities, as seen in his post-2019 trajectory.""In the lead-up to the 2024 elections, Ajit Pawar risked a significant family divide by fielding his wife, Sunetra Pawar, against his cousin Supriya Sule in the Baramati Lok Sabha polls. The gamble backfired, with Sunetra losing to Sule, a setback that many saw as a dent in his political acumen. Later, Ajit Pawar admitted the move was a mistake.Despite this, Ajit Pawar retained his hold on Baramati in the assembly elections, even with Sharad Pawar campaigning aggressively against him. His faction of the NCP secured 41 out of 59 seats it contested, a stark contrast to the NCP (Sharad Pawar faction), which struggled in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.Ajit Pawar’s journey began in 1982 when he was elected to the board of a sugar cooperative. Over the years, he carved a niche for himself in Maharashtra’s political and cooperative landscape, holding portfolios such as irrigation, finance, and water resources. He became an MLA in 1991 and has represented Baramati ever since.In 2019, Ajit Pawar briefly broke away from the NCP, forming a government with BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis. The government collapsed within three days, yet Ajit Pawar emerged stronger, later serving as Deputy CM in the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government and subsequently joining the Shinde-BJP alliance in 2023.With a firm grip on the NCP name and its iconic ""clock"" symbol, Ajit Pawar has not only outmaneuvered his uncle but also positioned himself as a pivotal player in Maharashtra’s political chessboard. However, his critics continue to question whether his ambitions will ever culminate in him leading the state as Chief Minister.For now, Ajit Pawar stands tall as Maharashtra’s political survivor, proving that adaptability and resilience are as critical as ambition in the game of power.","Ajit Pawar has been Maharashtra's deputy chief minister for the sixth time.

Historic 2024 election victory

NEW DELHI: Shortly after being sworn in as Maharashtra's chief minister for the third time, Devendra Fadnavis took his first official action by approving monetary assistance of Rs 5 lakh for a bone marrow transplant patient. According to the chief minister's office, the funds from the chief minister's relief fund were sanctioned for Chandrkant Shankar Kurhade, a Pune resident.Fadnavis directed the administration to expedite work processes and stressed the need to meet public expectations with urgency. ""We need to work faster, delve deeper into issues, and prioritise sustainable development while making key decisions,"" he urged officials.The swearing-in ceremony, held at Mumbai's Azad Maidan, was attended by key national leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah, and defence minister Rajnath Singh. Eknath Shinde and Ajit Pawar were sworn in as deputy chief ministers, underscoring the strength of the BJP-led Mahayuti alliance .Born on July 22, 1970, in Nagpur, Devendra Fadnavis comes from a middle-class family and holds a law degree, a postgraduate degree in business management, and a diploma in project management. His political career began in 1992 as a councillor in the Nagpur Municipal Corporation, where he served two consecutive terms. He has since been elected as an MLA five times.Fadnavis first served as Maharashtra’s chief minister from 2014 to 2019, becoming the second-youngest person to hold the position after Sharad Pawar. During his tenure, he managed key portfolios, including Home, IT, Urban Development, and Ports. His leadership saw several flagship initiatives, such as the Mumbai Next project, the Police Digitisation Project, the Samruddhi Expressway, and the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Krishi Sanman Scheme.He briefly served as chief minister for five days during the 2019 Maharashtra political crisis.The BJP-led Mahayuti alliance achieved a landslide victory in the 2024 Maharashtra Assembly Election , securing 235 seats. The BJP emerged as the largest party with 132 seats, followed by the Shiv Sena with 57 seats and the NCP with 41 seats. Meanwhile, the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) suffered a significant defeat, with Congress winning just 16 seats, the Shiv Sena (UBT) 20, and the NCP (Sharad Pawar faction) 10.With this mandate, Fadnavis is set to lead Maharashtra into a new phase of governance focused on stability and sustainable development.","Devendra Fadnavis was sworn in as Maharashtra's chief minister for the third time.

His decision comes as AAP prepares for the Delhi Assembly elections expected in early 2025.In his letter, Goel expressed gratitude for the trust and respect he received during his tenure. “For the last 10 years, I have efficiently performed my duties as MLA and Speaker of Shahdara Vidhan Sabha. You have always given me a lot of respect, for which I will always be grateful. Due to my age, I want to distance myself from electoral politics. I assure you that I will stay in Aam Aadmi Party and will continue to serve with all my heart and soul,” he wrote.Reacting to Goel’s announcement, Kejriwal described the moment as emotional for the party. “Ram Niwas Goel’s decision to leave electoral politics is an emotional moment for all of us.

Mahayuti’s win made possible by BJP & allies’ team effort: PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mahayutis-win-made-possible-by-bjp-allies-team-effort-pm-modi/articleshow/116025508.cms,"PM Modi at Maharashtra CM oath ceremony

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi Thursday said Mahayuti’s thumping win in Maharashtra was made possible by a team effort by BJP and its allies Shiv Sena (Shinde) and Ajit Pawar’s Nationalist Congress Party.“This team is a blend of experience and dynamism, and it is due to this team’s collective efforts that the Mahayuti has got a historic mandate in Maharashtra. This team will do everything possible to fulfil the aspirations of the people of the state and to ensure there is good governance,” Modi said on X (formerly Twitter) as he congratulated newly sworn-in CM Devendra Fadnavis and his two deputies — Eknath Shinde and Ajit Pawar.The remark was being seen in political circles as significant, given that in terms of numbers BJP is ahead of its allies by a mile and almost in a position to form govt on its own. It was seen as aimed at outgoing CM Shinde, in particular, who struggled to come to terms with his “demotion”, besides signalling the intent to take the two alliance partners along.Modi also assured all possible support from the Centre for Maharashtra’s development.In the November 20 elections to the 288-member Maharashtra assembly, BJP bagged 132 assembly seats, the highest among all constituents of the Mahayuti alliance . Shinde’s Shiv Sena and Ajit Pawar’s NCP also performed well, bagging 57 & 41 seats, respectively.","PM Narendra Modi said Mahayuti’s thumping win in Maharashtra was made possible by a team effort by BJP and its allies Shiv Sena (Shinde) and Ajit Pawar.

MUMBAI: Devendra Fadnavis ’s letter to governor CP Radhakrishnan stating he would take oath at 5.30 pm as CM along with two deputy CMs reached Raj Bhavan only at 2.30 pm Thursday, barely three hours before the actual swearing-in, as there was uncertainty until afternoon about whether Eknath Shinde would agree to be sworn in as deputy CM.Tension mounted in BJP camp in the absence of a letter from Shinde till Thursday morning; Shinde has been insisting on portfolios of his choice. However, in the morning, Shiv Sena ’s Uday Samant, Bharat Gogawale, Ravi Phatak and Sanjay Shirsat persuaded him to join the government as deputy CM, stating that the row over allotment of portfolios could be resolved at a later stage. Following their marathon meeting, Shinde agreed to take oath as deputy CM and a letter signed by Shinde was given to Fadnavis.It was then that Fadnavis sent his letter to the governor. Fadnavis could have sent his own name and that of Ajit Pawar on his own to the governor, but he waited for Shinde’s confirmation, sources said.Atop bureaucrat told TOI that the oath-taking event was confirmed only after written communication was received from CM-designate Fadnavis stating he along with Shinde and Ajit would take oath.Elaborating on what had happened earlier, the bureaucrat said that after the meeting of BJP legislature party Wednesday, a delegation comprising Shinde, Ajit and Fadnavis had called on the governor to stake claim for forma tion of the government. The delegation submitted a list of 237 MLAs supporting the Mahayuti. In addition, separate letters were given by BJP legislature party, Shiv Sena legislature party and NCP legislature party pledging support to Mahayuti government. Shinde and Ajit had earlier been elected as legislature party leaders of Sena and NCP, respectively.But in view of reservations expressed by Shinde over portfolios, no letter was given to Raj Bhavan stating Fadnavis would be leader of Mahayuti legislature party. During the interaction with media in the presence of Fadnavis and Ajit, Shinde was non-committal on whether he would join Mahayuti government as deputy CM. “There is no hurry, media will know by evening,” Shinde had said when asked if he would take oath as deputy CM.Sources said Shinde was hopeful he would get the portfolios of his choice and he was reluctant to join the government as deputy CM in the absence of any assurances in this regard.“All formalities were completed after Raj Bhavan received Fadnavis’s letter around 2.30pm, and the oathtaking took place as scheduled. Certainly it was a piquant situation, but there was no embarrassment, and the event passed off peacefully,” the bureaucrat added.Later at a presser, Fadnavis said about Shinde, “I am telling you 100% he wasn’t upset. Once I appealed to him, he accepted. When I was asked to be deputy CM after being CM, I was also reluctant. But I understood that without taking the post in an alliance government, there is a lack of coordination between the party & the government.”",Devendra Fadnavis’s letter to governor CP Radhakrishnan stated he would take oath at 5.30 pm as CM along with two deputy CMs. Tension mounted in BJP camp in the absence of a letter from Eknath Shinde till Thursday morning.

AGRA: A district court in Aligarh sentenced a 35-year-old woman -- a mother of four minor children -- and her 36-year-old lover to life imprisonment for the murder of her husband, Lekhraj Singh, in 2013.
