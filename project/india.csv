New Delhi: BJP on Friday flayed Congress over the Karnataka govt's decision to withdraw the general consent to the CBI to probe cases in the state amid the MUDA land allotment row, describing it as a response of a ""professional thief and a corrupt party"".Terming the Congress govt's move a bid to evade a CBI probe into the MUDA ""scam"" allegedly involving CM Siddaramaiah , BJP national spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla said the decision depicted a ""guilty mind"" in itself.""Thousands of crores have been usurped in the MUDA scam . After this, Congress has done what is expected from any certified 'chor and lootera' (thief and robber). To evade the long hand of law, it has withdrawn the general consent given to the CBI to investigate in the state,"" he said."" Congress is behaving like a professional thief and a professional corrupt party. First to err and then go brazen about it, this is the attitude and approach of Congress in Karnataka and other states where it is in power,"" Poonawalla added.Opposition parties in Karnataka have alleged that the Mysuru Urban Development Authority (MUDA) has fraudulently allotted sites to people who lost land to other development projects, including Siddaramaiah's wife Parvathi.Poonawalla alleged that Siddaramaiah was following the ""same approach"" of Congress since his alleged involvement in the MUDA scam worth Rs 5,000 crore surfaced, and demanded his resignation as CM.""When Narendra Modiji was chief minister of Gujarat, several cases were (registered) against him and the central probe agency was unleashed on him... Yet, being the chief minister, Narendra Modi ji cooperated fully with every investigation,"" he said.""This is the difference between a morally upright individual and one with a guilty conscience,"" Poonawalla said.Amid the MUDA land allotment row, the Karnataka govt on Thursday withdrew general consent given to CBI to investigate cases in the state as it alleged that the federal agency was ""biased"".Announcing the decision after a cabinet meeting chaired by CM Siddaramaiah, law and parliamentary affairs minister H K Patil said, ""It is clear that the CBI or the central govt are not using their instrumentalities judiciously.""",Karnataka govt on Thursday withdrew general consent given to CBI to investigate cases in the state.

NEW DELHI: Firing a fresh salvo against Congress ahead of the Haryana polls , BJP on Friday raised the alleged corruption involving Rahul Gandhi's brother-in-law Robert Vadra when the opposition party was in power in the state.BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia claimed the election in the state is a fight between ""Haryana ka laal (son of Haryana)"" and ""dalaal (fixer)"" of the Gandhi family, as he questioned the Congress brass silence on the corruption charges against Vadra and the party's then govt headed by Bhupinder Singh Hooda He said peoplehave made up their mind to elect BJP for a third straight term.While Gandhi has been speaking about farmers' issues, he has not said a word about his ""land-grabbing"" brother-in-law, Bhatia said. Hooda is just a mask and the real face of corruption is the Gandhi family, he alleged, citing questionable land deals involving Vadra.In one case, he noted, Vadra's firm allegedly acquired 3.5 acres of land from farmers and the then Hooda govt changed the land use, allowing him to pocket a huge profit by selling the land parcel at four times the purchase price.In another case, farmers resorted to distress selling of their land after the Congress govt in the state issued a notification to acquire their land and then denotified after a builder linked to Vadra bought their land, he alleged.","BJP raises alleged corruption involving Rahul Gandhi's brother-in-law Robert Vadra.

GURUGRAM: Even as he declared that BJP would retain Nayab Singh Saini as CM if it gets a third term in Haryana, Union home minister Amit Shah sought to put a spoke in Congress's efforts to put a lid on the rift between Bhupinder Singh Hooda and his factional rival Selja by accusing the former Haryana CM of having an anti-Dalit mindset.""Don't get tired as you have to work as CM of Haryana for another five years,"" Shah told Saini, his remarks at a large public rally at grain market at Barara in Ambala consolidating the prominence of Saini who was dramatically catapulted into the CM's office because of party's recognition of the fatigue with his predecessor, Manohar Lal Khattar .In his rally, Shah played up the the differences between Hooda and his in-house Dalit challenger, Selja who is widely perceived to be unhappy over having been marginalised in the distribution of tickets. A day after Congress got Hooda and Selja to appear together at a rally addressed by Rahul Gandhi, Shah seized upon the footage of her conversation with a journo that shone the spotlight on the simmering feud. Asked about whether she would campaign for the candidates belonging to the rival faction, Selja bluntly says she was not going to be invited.Referring to the statement, Shah said that the clip was emblematic of Hooda's anti-Dalit mindset.""Dalit brothers of Haryana have not forgotten the Dohana incident and Nijpur incident. Recently, a journalist asked Selja Ji whether she would go to campaign for Hooda. She answered by saying that although she wants to do that, Hooda will not invite her. Hooda still has the mindset. He fears that he will lose an election if a Dalit woman campaigns for him. But we have given a nomination to our Dalit sister,"" he said at a rally in Ladwa assembly constituency. Hooda and Selja had shared dias, for the first time on Thursday, during a Rahul rally.Reiterating the party's commitment made in its manifesto, Shah promised govt jobs with pension to Haryana youths joining armed forces through Agniveer scheme . ""Join the forces with passion. Haryana and the Indian govt will give jobs with pension to all the Agniveers of Haryana,"" the home minister said, asserting ""Pakki pension wali sarkari naukri (govt jobs with pension)"".In Rewari, which has had strong links with the Army, Shah praised mothers for raising their children with sacrifice and valour to protect the country's borders. ""During Congress govts in Haryana, the jobs were given to youth with kharchi and parchi (corruption or recommendation). BJP gave jobs without any kharchi and parchi,"" he said.","BJP would retain Nayab Singh Saini as CM if it gets a third term in Haryana.

While Reasi, where the decline was the sharpest since 2014, had seen a major terror attack in June with nine persons killed after terrorists fired on a bus, Rajouri and Poonch have seen fierce encounters between the security forces and terrorists in the recent months.The gap between male and female voter turnout was wide in many constituencies of Kashmir region; like, it was over 10.6 percentage points in Zadibal AC, 10.4 in Budgam AC, 9.9 in Lal Chowk AC and 9.6 in Habbakadal AC.

The court indicated it would hear the plea in the afternoon.The father requested the court to direct the local civic body to find a place to bury his son, Akshay Shinde, who was 24 years old.Shinde was accused of sexually assaulting two minor girls at a school in Badlapur, Thane district and was in custody since last month.The alleged shootout occurred earlier this week while Shinde was being transported from Taloja jail to Badlapur due to a case filed by his second wife.During the transport, near the Mumbra Bypass in Thane on Monday evening, Shinde allegedly snatched a policeman's gun, leading to his death in retaliatory police firing.Shinde's father has filed a petition in the high court, claiming his son was killed in a fake encounter and has requested a high court-monitored probe into the incident.On Wednesday, Justice Dere's bench questioned the incident and stressed the need for a fair and impartial investigation , stating the incident could have been avoided.The family stated Shinde had expressed a wish to be buried instead of cremated. His body is currently in the mortuary of a civic hospital in Thane's Kalwa area.

Tirupati temple row: Why Jagan Reddy’s religion has become a flashpoint in Andhra Pradesh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tirupati-temple-row-why-jagan-reddys-religion-has-become-a-flashpoint-in-andhra-pradesh/articleshow/113742786.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former Andhra Pradesh chief minister and YSRCP chief Jagan Mohan Reddy on Friday hit out at CM Chandrababu Naidu and said ""demons are ruling"" the state as he cancelled his visit to Tirumala temple. He said he had ""never seen political parties creating hurdles even to visit a temple"".Reddy cancelled his scheduled visit to Tirumala temple on September 28 amid the adulterated Tirupati laddus row over security concerns and demand for 'declaration of faith'.Claiming that Reddy was a believer of Christianity , TDP had demanded that Jagan Reddy must declare his faith before the temple visit.TDP's allies BJP and Jana Sena also insisted that Reddy declare his faith before entering the Sri Venkateswara temple.Rule 136 of the temple board's guidelines states that only Hindus are allowed to go for darshan. Non-Hindus who wish to have darshan of Lord Venkateswara will have to inform the TTD Board about their religion and have to declare the same in a form as per their conscience only as mentioned in Rule 137.Amid the heat, Reddy finally cancelled his visit which was meant to atone for the ""sin"" allegedly committed by CM Naidu who claimed that animal fat was used in the laddus, part of temple prasadam.""Many questions have been raised about my caste. I read the Bible at home, and I respect and follow Hinduism, Islam, and Sikhism. I belong to the community of humanity. What does the Constitution say? If a person equivalent to the chief minister is not allowed into the temple, I question how Dalits will be treated,"" he said.This is not the first time Reddy's religion has become a flashpoint in Andhra Pradesh politics. His opponents have time and again used his Christian faith to portray him as 'anti-Hindu'. This is also not the first time Reddy has openly disclosed that he follows Christianity and reads the Bible.In 2019, after a glorious victory in the Lok Sabha elections, as he was asked about Congress and his exit and if he felt vindicated after the results, he said, ""I pray and read my Bible. It is for God to decide.""During his whole tenure as chief minister, he was under constant attack by the opposition as they blamed him for the desecration of temples in Andhra Pradesh and conversions.He was also attacked for several decisions for the Christian community in the state. The Reddy government hiked financial aid to Christian pilgrims visiting Jerusalem in Israel and other Biblical places. The state-sponsored tour period of the Biblical places was also enhanced from eight to 10 days.In August 2019, Reddy’s trip to Jerusalem which was ""purely personal and the expenditure shall be borne by the dignitary"" was also criticised by the opposition after the Andhra Pradesh government spent Rs 22.5 lakh on it. His government, however, dismissed the charges stating the cost was towards security arrangements.During this time, Naidu's party, which had till now stayed away from communal remarks, also started targeting the Reddy government over temple vandalism incidents and for pushing English medium school education as a ""ploy to spread Christianity"" in the state.Amid huge debate over his religious faith, Reddy's uncle YV Subba Reddy also took over as the 50th chairman of Tirumala trust board in June, 2019.Jagan Reddy, who has visited the hill shrine several times, has always found himself in the middle of the ""declare your faith"" campaign.In September 2020, when as CM he visited Tirupati temple , TDP and BJP renewed their demand that he should sign the declaration.Adding to the fuel, the temple trust chairman had stated at that time that the declaration was not needed for the temple entry of the non-Hindus.Now in 2024, just months after the tables were turned in favor of Chandrababu Naidu and Reddy lost power in Andhra Pradesh, the new CM has attacked the Reddy government by alleging that it allowed the use of animal fat in Tirupati laddus and hurt the sentiments of Hindus across the country.And once again, the ""declare your faith"" attack has come back to haunt Reddy.","Reddy cancelled his scheduled visit to Tirumala temple on September 28 amid the adulterated Tirupati laddus row.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday said it will examine the serious allegations of Enforcement Directorate and Chhattisgarh govt that Nagarik Apurti Nigam (NAN or PDS) scam accused ex-bureaucrats Anil K Tuteja and Alok Shukla allegedly influenced a HC judge for getting anticipatory bail.A bench of Justices A S Oka and A G Masih repeatedly asked additional solicitor general S V Raju for evidence on two counts - whether the ex-bureaucrats have misused the bail granted to them to tamper with evidence and for allegedly influencing the HC judge for getting pre-arrest bail in the scam.Raju said the evidence was filed in a sealed cover by the ED but the bench was unable to trace it. Raju offered to file it afresh. Senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani, appearing for Chhattisgarh govt, said the state in its affidavits have annexed details of WhatsApp chats to show the nexus between the ex-bureaucrats, the then advocate general of the state and the judge.Appearing for the accused, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi said Chhattisgarh govt has no role in the case as it was between the accused and the ED and wondered why it has filed the affidavit in the case.Jethmalani said the then AG of the state had participated in the perpetration of the fraud and facilitated grant of bail in subversion of established judicial process. Rohatgi said these affidavits are meaningless in the proceedings pending before the court as the ED is seeking shifting of the trial of the case outside the state.While posting next hearing in the case to Nov 8, the bench said it must examine the evidence furnished by the ED and state govt on the alleged nexus between the accused, former AG and the judge.""We will examine it as the charge is against the judicial system,"" the bench said.

JAMMU: BJP president JP Nadda on Friday accused National Conference (NC)-Congress combine and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) of trying to revive the “era of violence and bloodshed” in J&K.“They are supporting activists working against the country. NC’s manifesto says it will release terrorists (from jails), resume cross-border trade and talks with Pakistan. This is how NC is supporting anti-India forces and Congress is backing it,” Nadda told a news conference in Jammu.The BJP chief was speaking on a day he addressed a rally at Billawar in Jammu’s Kathua ahead of the final phase of J&K assembly polls on October 1.“NC and Congress have struck a deal to save their families and promote corruption. They are least bothered about the people of J&K,” Nadda said, echoing PM Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah’s dynastic charge at the two parties.Nadda hailed the momentous polls, saying the “people of J&K have rejected bullets and chosen the path of ballots”. “They have given a befitting reply to bullets. This is the first election after which not only representatives of PoK and J&K but also nominated members of Kashmiri migrants will sit in the assembly,” Nadda said.He was alluding to the families of PoK refugees who came in 1947 and settled in J&K as well as those ofKashmiri Pandits forced to leave the Valley after the onset of terrorism in the 1990s. The new assembly will have one nominated member of PoK refugees and two of Pandits.Referring to the J&K visit by heads of missions of 16 countries during the polls, Nadda described it as an international stamp on the peaceful exercise. “They saw the law and order and how people have increasingly participated in the polls.”Nadda stressed the importance of the abrogation of J&K’s special status by the Modi govt, highlighting the development schemes ushered in by the Centre after the Aug 2019 decision. “After the abrogation of Article 370, J&K has become a place for premier institutions, from AIIMS to IITs and emerged as a knowledge hub. This is PM Modi’s gift to J&K,” the BJP chief said.","BJP president JP Nadda accused National Conference (NC)-Congress combine and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) of trying to revive the “era of violence and bloodshed” in J&K. “NC’s manifesto says it will release terrorists (from jails), resume cross-border trade and talks with Pakistan.
