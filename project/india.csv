"Suvendu Adhikari’s call to stay off Kashmir riles own party, NC slams it as ‘terrorism’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/suvendu-adhikaris-call-to-stay-off-kashmir-riles-own-party-nc-slams-it-as-terrorism/articleshow/122410995.cms,"File photo: Bengal BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari (Picture credit: PTI)

SRINAGAR: Bengal BJP leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari’s comments advising Bengal’s people not to travel to Kashmir have drawn fire in J&K, with his own party repudiating the statement and the governing National Conference (NC) equating it with “terrorism”.“Kashmir is the crown of India, an integral part of our motherland. Every Indian holds Kashmir close to his heart,” former J&K BJP chief Ravinder Raina said in a video message where she asked Adhikari to visit the Valley and witness firsthand the “patriotism of Kashmiris”.Adhikari had advised Bengal’s people against going to places “where Muslims are in a majority”. “If you want to visit Kashmir, visit Jammu.” Referring to the Pahalgam terror attack, Adhikari said tourists were “selectively killed” and advised people to visit Himachal Pradesh or Uttarakhand instead.Raina contested Adhikari’s version of events. “After the Pahalgam terror attack, it was local Kashmiris who rescued the wounded and later sheltered tourists to ensure their safety. Thousands of Kashmiris have laid down their lives for the nation’s unity and security. Many of our own BJP workers from Kashmir were killed by terrorists. Countless Kashmiri policemen and security personnel have been martyred defending the country.If the Tricolour flies proudly in Kashmir today, it is because of the sacrifices and patriotism of Kashmiris,” Raina said.Adhikari’s comments came after a meeting between J&K CM Omar Abdullah and Bengal’s Mamata Banerjee in Kolkata on Thursday. After the talks, Mamata had appealed to the people of her state to travel to Kashmir and support its tourism. She also accepted Omar’s invitation to visit the Valley, promising to do so after Durga Puja in Sept.Mamata’s TMC has slammed Adhikari’s comments, accusing him of indulging in a “disgraceful, calculated act of communal provocation” and “pushing the message of terrorists at home”.On Saturday, Omar’s NC echoed the condemnation. NC spokesperson Tanvir Sadiq said he did not find “any difference between him (Suvendu) and terrorists” and pointed out that the statement was contrary to efforts by the Centre and J&K govt to revive tourism. “Terrorists also wanted that no one should visit Kashmir and this person (Adhikari) is saying the same. If you want to condemn the Pahalgam terror attack, you must visit Kashmir,” Sadiq added.","Bengal BJP leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari advised Bengal’s people not to travel to Kashmir.

The court accepted his plea, observing that there was no material suggesting he posed a flight risk.Additional Sessions Judge Bhupinder Singh noted that Kumar “has not only the right but also duty towards his family for taking them for a family vacation.” In an order dated July 7, the court added, “No such conduct of the accused has been brought to the notice of the court, since he was released on bail, that may dissuade this court to consider the prayer made by the accused to travel abroad.”The judge further said that Kumar had earlier received a no-objection certificate to renew his passport, which had not been challenged by the prosecution. The additional deputy commissioner of police, North district, had argued that there was no emergency warranting foreign travel, but the court dismissed that concern.“I find no reasons as to why the application should not be allowed, more so, when the next date of hearing is much later than the intended dates of travel,” the judge said, while imposing conditions such as a fixed deposit of ?5 lakh and a requirement that Kumar inform the court of his return within 72 hours.No extension of his stay would be allowed.Kumar is accused of assaulting Maliwal at Kejriwal’s then official residence on May 13, 2024.

Siddaramaiah Dismisses CM Change Talks Amid Rising Buzz in Congress Circles

BENGALURU/NEW DELHI: Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah slammed the door Thursday on speculation about an imminent baton change with his deputy DK Shivakumar by declaring there was ""no vacancy"" at the top. He then threw down the gauntlet to any future challenger with the clincher: ""I will lead party in 2028 state polls too.""Siddaramaiah, seen as being on shaky ground ever since his wife was named as an alleged beneficiary of Muda land-swap scam, acknowledged Shivakumar's chief ministerial ambitions but said he was realistic enough to accept that Karnataka had ""a CM for the full term"".""I am very much here before you. I am the CM of Karnataka. That is what Shivakumar has said, and I am also saying it,"" he told reporters in Delhi. ""Shivakumar has never stated that the CM should be changed,"" he said.On few MLAs seeking a change and rooting for Shivakumar, the CM claimed their numbers were insignificant. ""Few MLAs may support him, majority don't."" Sidda said he and Shivakumar were answerable to party brass... that was how it should be.Shivakumar, too, is in Delhi, apparently waiting to meet party chief Mallikarjun Kharge and LS LoP Rahul Gandhi. Party insiders said Shivakumar was attempting to convince Siddaramaiah through Congress high command to accept a rotation formula for the chief ministership, as was the buzz when the party came to govt in 2023.","Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah slammed the door on speculation about an imminent baton change with his deputy DK Shivakumar.

Delhi Judge Cash Row: Modi Govt Likely To Move Impeachment Motion Against Justice Varma

Poll Do you support the impeachment of Justice Yashwant Varma for corruption charges? Yes, he should be impeached No, he should not be impeached

NEW DELHI: With government indicating that it will set up a statutory inquiry committee as part of impeachment proceedings of Justice Yashwant Varma contrary to its earlier stance, Congress is likely to support the move to sack the judge on corruption charges, even as it plans to use the platform to ""embarrass"" BJP for ignoring similar proceedings against another judge Shekhar Yadav over ""hate speech"".The push in Congress is to use impeachment proceedings to hammer at government's ""selective approach"" against judges. In a rare occurrence, twin impeachment proceedings are hanging fire simultaneously - Varma is facing the charge of corruption after the alleged recovery and burning of cash at his residence, while Allahabad high court judge Shekhar Yadav is in the firing line for his controversial comments about Uniform Civil Code.Interestingly, while central government has announced its intent to bring an impeachment motion against Varma, opposition last Dec filed an impeachment notice against Yadav for ""hate speech"" but govt has maintained silence on it.Senior lawyer and Congress MP Abhishek Singhvi said, ""There should be no double standards in the way govt seeks to approach Varma and Yadav cases. Selectivity and opportunism between the two cases is not good.Both deserve initiation of impeachment process. In Yadav case, govt has already dragged its feet long enough.""Congress sources said the party is expected to support impeachment of Varma in monsoon session of Parliament. Congress functionaries like Singhvi and Vivek Tankha had earlier targeted govt for planning to do away with the inquiry panel provided for in Judges Inquiry Act, and warned that the ""violation"" will lay grounds for Varma's discharge later.Now, sources said, government has since conveyed that it will set up an inquiry committee on Varma.However, a big issue for opposition is ""hate speech"" by Justice Yadav, for which its impeachment notice is pending. Modi govt has not given any indication on taking it up, despite public calls for it by Congress functionaries, and a letter by lawyer-MP Vivek Tankha to Rajya Sabha chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar.A senior Congress functionary said, ""We are not linking the two issues of impeachment. We will support the move to sack Varma, but we will use the platform to embarrass govt on its selective approach on accountability in the judiciary.""","Congress is likely to support the move to sack the judge on corruption charges.

High court rejects pre-arrest protection of gangster Suresh Pujari associates in 2021 BJP Neta extortion case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thane/high-court-rejects-pre-arrest-protection-of-gangster-suresh-pujari-associates-in-2021-bjp-neta-extortion-case/articleshow/122414257.cms,"The Bombay High Court has revoked pre-arrest protection for three associates of gangster Suresh Pujari in connection with a 2021 extortion case. BJP leader Amit Wadhwa was threatened by Pujari over a Rs 1 crore ransom after the associates failed to repay a Rs 2 crore loan.





ULHASNAGAR: In the case of gangster Suresh Pujari threatening BJP leader Amit Wadhwa with an extortion demand of Rs 1 crore in 2021, the High Court rejected the pre-arrest protection given to three associates of Pujari. The High Court stated that police interrogation of Sushil Udasi, Pankaj Tilokani, and Umesh Rajpal is required.Four people took a loan of over Rs 2 crore from Wadhwa, who is the Chairman of Kalpataru Cooperative Credit Society. However, the money was not returned. When Wadhwa asked for the loan money back from the accused, they got Suresh Pujari to call Wadhwa.Wadhwa was threatened on the phone, being told not to ask for money from the four and to pay an additional ransom of Rs 1 crore to save his life.The incident dates back to 2021 when Wadhwa lodged a complaint at the local Ulhasnagar police station and presented the phone call records to the police. In these records, Suresh Pujari, on behalf of the four other accused—Sushil Udasi, Pankaj Tilokani, Umesh Rajpal, and Roshan Mahesh Makhija—threatened Wadhwa, demanded Rs 1 crore, and asked him to waive off the loan taken by these four and give them a no-dues certificate.Based on this call record, the police registered a case of extortion against the four, besides Pujari, and handed over the investigation to the Central Crime Unit of the Crime Branch.During that time, many businessmen in Ulhasnagar city were threatened by don Suresh Pujari for money. A cable operator was also killed, and there was a shooting outside a builder's office.In such a situation, considering the seriousness of the case, the Central Crime Unit started searching for the four accused, all of whom absconded. Makhija later got bail from the sessions court, while the remaining three accused received pre-arrest protection from the High Court.Wadhwa filed a petition in the court against the pre-arrest protection given to the four accused by the High Court.During the hearing on Wadhwa's plea this week, High Court Judge Nitin Sambre stated that the transcript produced by the complainant on record sufficiently justifies the allegations against the accused, which, in his opinion, warrant custodial interrogation. Therefore, the pre-arrest protection given to them is rejected.However, the judge's order provides them with four weeks of temporary protection before arrest. After the High Court order, Wadhwa said the arrest of the three accused will help the police crack the trio's nexus with gangster Suresh Pujari, who he suspects provided information about many other businessmen from the city to Pujari for ransom.","BJP leader Amit Wadhwa was threatened by Pujari over a Rs 1 crore ransom after the associates failed to repay a Rs 2 crore loan.
