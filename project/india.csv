NEW DELHI: Uttar Pradesh Congress chief Ajay Rai on Tuesday claimed that Rahul Gandhi’s “ hydrogen bomb ” will go off in Varanasi — suggesting that the Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha may expose alleged “vote chori” (vote theft) on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s parliamentary seat.""Like our leader (Rahul Gandhi) said yesterday, after his 'atom bomb' expose on Bengaluru's Mahadevapura assembly seat, we will now explode 'hydrogen bomb'. Which is the most powerful bomb? Hydrogen bomb. Such a bomb should explode at the most important place. Now it's obvious what happened in Banaras (Varanasi) after 1 pm (on June 4 - day of Lok Sabha election counting). PM Modi cheated to win,"" Rai told reporters.He clarified, however, that he had not spoken to Gandhi on the matter and that these were his own views.""It's obvious, isn't it, what he (Gandhi) was hinting at,"" Rai added.Ex-Congress president Gandhi had made the “hydrogen bomb” remark at a mega rally in Patna on Monday, which marked the culmination of his 16-day state-wide tour of poll-bound Bihar. During his tour, he reiterated his ""vote chort"" charge against the Election Commission and BJP.""I showed 'atom bomb' to expose the vote theft in Mahadevapura but now I am coming out soon with a more powerful 'hydrogen bomb' to make the whole country aware about the truth of vote theft,"" the he told the gathering.The Rae Bareli MP then directly targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying the prime minister “would not be able to face the public” after the revelation.Modi’s victory margin in Varanasi—where he was elected to the Lok Sabha for a third consecutive term—was his lowest so far. He secured 54 per cent of the vote, compared with 64 per cent in 2014 and 56 per cent in 2019. Rai, who contested against him, polled 41 per cent, a significant rise from just 7 per cent when he finished third in 2014.",Uttar Pradesh Congress chief Ajay Rai says Rahul Gandhi's 'hydrogen bomb' will go off in Varanasi. Rai suggests that Gandhi may expose alleged 'vote chori' (vote theft) on PM Narendra Modi's parliamentary seat.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123668506,imgsize-29278,width-400,resizemode-4/pm-narendra-modi-and-ajay-rai-varanasi-news.jpg"

Voter ID Row: BJP Targets Pawan Khera With Double ID Claim, He Retorts With Big Charge On EC

NEW DELHI: BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya on Wednesday intensified his attack on the Congress, this time targeting Pawan Khera's wife and Congress leader Kota Neelima. Malviya alleged that Neelima holds ""two active EPICs - one registered Khairatabad and another in New Delhi. ""He also hit out at Rahul Gandhi, saying the Congress leader held a press conference without ""adequate due diligence."" Malviya claimed Rahul “targeted and tarnished honest voters — even putting them at risk by revealing their identities without consent. He doxxed young, upwardly mobile professionals and poor daily wagers who had moved cities in search of better opportunities.”Referring to Rahul’s earlier allegations of “vote chori” and claims that the Election Commission was “colluding with the BJP” during recent assembly elections, Malviya added: “Yet, he has maintained an equivocal silence on the shocking revelation that his close aide holds two EPIC cards. Is he the only one? Apparently not.”Malviya further alleged that “it’s now quite obvious” that Congress leaders hold multiple voter IDs across constituencies. “This is no coincidence,” he said, also drawing Sonia Gandhi into the row: “The rot isn’t limited to Pawan Khera and family. It goes back to the top — when Sonia Gandhi, an Italian, managed to get her name included in the voter list in 1980.”This fresh round of accusations comes a day after Malviya had claimed that Pawan Khera himself held two EPICs.Following that, the Electoral Registration Officer (ERO) of New Delhi issued a notice to Khera, stating that his name appears in both the New Delhi and Jangpura constituencies, and asked why action should not be taken against him.Khera, however, hit back at the Election Commission, alleging bias. He said the poll body functions “to support the ruling regime” and questioned why no notice had been issued to “the 1,00,000 fake voters of Mahadevapura constituency” in Karnataka, as highlighted earlier by Rahul Gandhi.","BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya has intensified his attack on the Congress.

'Only Mistake I Made Was...': Prajwal Revanna Tells Court Before Life Sentence In Rape Case

Poll Do you think protests will effectively change the political situation in Punjab? Yes No





PATIALA: AAP MLA Harmeet Singh Pathanmajra has allegedly escaped police custody while being taken to a local police station after his arrest.According to Punjab Police sources, Pathanmajra and his accomplices fired at police officers during the escape and even ran over one personnel, leaving him injured.According to reports, Pathanmajra and his accomplices ran over police personnel with an SUV.The Sanour MLA was arrested a day after publicly criticising his party’s Delhi leadership.His detention in Patiala was linked to a rape case filed against him, sparking political uproar in the region.In a social media post, Pathanmajra claimed the case related to his former wife and alleged that the fresh charges of rape were politically motivated.“I was booked because I raised my voice against my own government, especially the Delhi leadership,” he wrote.His brother, Hardev Singh, said the MLA was taken into custody under Section 376 of the IPC despite already having been granted bail by the Punjab and Haryana High Court. “He was arrested from Dabri in Haryana in a case where bail was already granted. This is clearly an attempt to silence him,” he alleged.CIA Patiala confirmed that three weapons have been recovered and one accomplice of MLA Pathanmajra has been arrested.The arrested individual has been identified as Balwinder Singh, while the search for MLA Pathanmajra continues.Police said two officers were injured when stones were thrown at them during the MLA’s escape attempt.Authorities added that supporters of the MLA not only pelted stones but also opened fire at the police team.Before his arrest, Pathanmajra had appealed to colleagues and supporters via Facebook to protest outside the Patiala SSP’s office at the Mini Secretariat. He urged people to reach “in tractors, trolleys, and cars” to demand his release. “I will not be silenced even if more cases are registered against me. Will AAP’s Delhi leadership rule Punjabis now? Even Congress and BJP did not interfere to this extent,” he said.The MLA has repeatedly accused the party’s central leadership of sidelining Punjab leaders and “remote-controlling” the state. Recently, he criticised officials of the Irrigation Department over flood relief efforts in his constituency. Soon after, his security cover was withdrawn and police officers in the area were reshuffled — moves that raised eyebrows.“This is retaliation. They looted Punjab more than Abdali. Now they want to sell Punjab,” Pathanmajra declared.","Harmeet Singh Pathanmajra allegedly escaped police custody while being taken to a local police station after his arrest.

‘Insult To Every Mother’: PM Modi Tears Into Congress-RJD For Abusing His Late Mother

Poll Should political parties be held accountable for remarks made during rallies? Yes, they should be No, it's free speech

Video of clash went viral



NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday broke his silence with a sharp rebuttal over the Bihar rally row, after a viral video allegedly showed abusive remarks directed at his late mother. He called the remarks an insult not only to him but to “every mother, sister, and daughter of the country,” adding that the people of Bihar shared his anguish.Speaking at an event of the Bihar Rajya Jeevika Nidhi Saakh Sahkari Sangh Limited, PM Modi said, ""Mother is our world. Mother is our self-respect. I had not even imagined what happened a few days ago in this tradition-rich Bihar. My mother was abused from the stage of RJD-Congress in Bihar... These abuses are not just an insult to my mother. These are insults to the mothers, sisters and daughters of the country. I know.. . how bad all of you, every mother of Bihar, felt after seeing and hearing this! I know, as much pain as I have in my heart, the people of Bihar are also in the same pain.""PM Modi went on to say that his late mother had distanced him from herself so that he could dedicate his life to serving the nation.He said, ""My mother separated me from her so that I could serve crores of mothers like you. You all know that now my mother is not alive. Some time ago, after completing 100 years of age, she left us all. That mother of mine, who had nothing to do with politics, who is no more, was abused from the stage of the RJD, Congress. Sisters and mothers, I can see your faces; I can only imagine the pain you must have felt. I can see tears in the eyes of some mothers. This is very sad, painful.""Slamming the RJD-Congress over remarks targeting his mother, PM Narendra Modi said, ""'Yuvraaj,' born in a royal family with golden and silver spoons, cannot understand the pain of a poor mother.""His remarks came days after a video went viral on social media, purportedly showing unidentified men hurling abuses at PM Modi and his late mother from the stage of Rahul Gandhi’s ‘Voter Adhikar Yatra’ in Darbhanga, held along with RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar , a key ally of the BJP in the upcoming state assembly polls, also condemned the incident.In a post on X, he said, ""During the Voter Adhikar Yatra in Darbhanga, the use of highly inappropriate language against the Honourable Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi and his late mother from the platform of Congress and RJD is utterly deplorable, and I condemn it.""BJP and Congress workers clashed in Patna last week after the saffron party staged a protest over alleged abuses directed at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his mother during a rally in Darbhanga.
