"Battling BJP push, Naveen keeping it short and sharp",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/battling-bjp-push-naveen-keeping-it-short-and-sharp/articleshow/110286558.cms,"BHUBANESHWAR: Naveen Patnaik is known for coming across as a man of few words. Despite being at the helm in Odisha for decades, lengthy speeches have never been his style. This year though, as he seeks a sixth straight term in office, he is covering the miles and making sure he gets his message across succinctly, keeping it conversational.Despite concerns about his age and health, the 77-year-old bachelor looks undeterred.He is criss-crossing the state — Odisha is voting simultaneously to elect its state assembly and send MPs to Lok Sabha — to canvass for party candidates in the gruelling summer heat. Even as his trusted aide, V K Pandian, conducts far more extensive tours on his behalf, Naveen himself has been strategically selecting specific areas for campaigning, attending three to four rallies a day.In 2019, Naveen would pose a question to the crowds after a short speech. “Aapana maane khusi ta (are you all happy)?” That phrase became a popular tagline for BJD . This year, Naveen has been posing a series of questions to the gathering after making brief remarks at campaign stops. “You will get free electricity from July. Are you happy?”; “Are you happy with Biju Swasthya Kalyan Yojana (BSKY)?”; “Is Kalia scheme good?” And, after the chorus of replies from the people, “Is Naveen Patnaik good?”“Vote for Jodi Sankha (twin conch; BJD’s election symbol)” is Naveen’s new slogan as he seeks votes for the 21 Lok Sabha and 147 Vidhan Sabha seats.He also subtly criticises the opposition, specifically BJP, accusing its leaders of shedding crocodile tears over Odisha’s struggles while questioning the promised ‘achhe din’ narrative. Then there are the short videos of Naveen talking on various issues that his team has been releasing. To counter ‘Modi’s guarantee’, he has been highlighting ‘Naveen’s guarantee’ to promote his welfare promises ranging from free electricity to nearuniversal free health coverage under BSKY.A significant feature of Naveen’s campaign is the prominent presence of Pandian on the dais. After Naveen’s “questions” to voters , Pandian takes over. If Naveen makes veiled attacks, Pandian amplifies them, providing details of the BJD govt’s schemes and sharpening the party’s criticism of BJP.Poll analyst R K Satpathy said BJD poll managers are well aware of how the mere presence of Naveen is a significant draw for voters. A simple wave of Naveen’s hand, it is felt, can work magic as BJD banks on the love and trust he enjoys with the public. “No other face in BJD comes close to having the same appeal among the electors. Naveen is the face, heart and soul of BJD; everything revolves around him,” said Satpathy.Another analyst, Jayant Mohapatra, observed that Naveen’s stance towards BJP is more aggressive this time compared with previous elections . “That may be his response to BJP leaders’ attacks on him. Had Naveen not responded, he would have been perceived as being weak. He certainly doesn’t want that,” Mohapatra said.After a visible warmth in ties — till coalition talks failed between the two estranged partners who shared power in Odisha from 2000 to 2009 — BJP and BJD are going hammer and tongs at each other. If PM Narendra Modi said ‘Odia Asmita’, or pride, faces a threat under Naveen, Union home minister Amit Shah accused Naveen of pushing Odisha back by 50 years. Naveen, the Odisha CM since 2000, has responded by saying the BJP leaders remember the state only during elections.This time, Naveen contested from two assembly seats, Hinjili and Kantabanji, both of which voted on May 20, the second of the four phases of polling in the state. While Hinjili is his usual seat, where he fought his first assembly poll battle, joining the fray from Kantabanji in western Odisha was a calculated move with a view to galvanising voters to back BJD in what is a BJP stronghold.","Despite concerns about his age and health, the 77-year-old bachelor looks undeterred.

"In Phulpur, Nehru’s ‘running mate’ Masuriya Din a distant memory",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-phulpur-nehrus-running-mate-masuriya-din-a-distant-memory/articleshow/110286215.cms,"Major parties field OBCs

In India’s electoral memory, Phulpur is best remembered as India’s first PM Jawaharlal Nehru’s constituency. Not many know that Nehru wasn’t the only MP then representing the Uttar Pradesh seat. In the 1950s, as many as 86 Lok Sabha seats had “two-member” representation, seats which could elect two MPs. This practice, abolished in 1961, was primarily adopted to ensure a healthy representation of SCs and STs in those early years of Independence.The second MP from the seat was Masuriya Din, who won four LS elections: Phulpur (1952 and 1957) and Chail (1962 and 1967). Nehru often addressed Masuriya Din with the prefix, mahashay, a respectful term meaning high-thinking. TOI reports referred to him as Nehru’s “running mate”.It’s fascinating how two remarkable leaders with contrasting backgrounds — one elite, the other subaltern — came to share a constituency. Nehru’s pathway from Allahabad’s palatial Anand Bhavan to Teen Murti in New Delhi, via Harrow and Cambridge, is well-documented. But the extraordinary journey of his political partner is little known.Born into a deprived SC family, Masuriya Din went to a govt school. “He was impressed by Gandhi, drawn to the national movement and joined Congress on being urged by Motilal Nehru,” says research scholar Pradeep Rawat, who’s working on a dissertation on him. Masuriya Din was jailed during the Salt Satyagraha (1930), and again in 1940 and 1942. He also ran a printing press that published anti-colonial literature.“He was in prison when his first wife, Ram Pyari, passed away. Authorities told him he would be allowed to attend the funeral if he stops publishing anti-govt writing. He refused,” says grandson Sachin Kumar, who runs Mahashay Masuriya Din school in Teliarganj, Prayagraj (formerly Allahahad). His father, Shashi Prakash, was elected a Janata Dal MP from Chail (UP) in 1991.Ram Abhilash Saroj, who edits New Pasi Darpan, underlines Masuriya Din’s focus on education and reforms. As per 1952’s Who’s Who, he founded a Harijan hostel in Allahabad and nine Harijan primary pathshalas. Rawat says his message was, “Send at least one child to school. In these schools, an empty earthen pot (matki) would be kept outside the classroom. Parents would drop a fistful of grain, vegetables or coins. That would be the teacher’s wage.”Masuriya Din’s daughter Kamla Devi, president, national women’s wing of Lok Janshakti Party (LJP), says, “He played an important role in the abolition of the Criminal Tribes Act, which stained our community. Which is why his birthday is celebrated by the Pasi Samaj even today.”Masuriya Din, also a vegetarian and an anti-alcohol activist, shared a close rapport with Indira Gandhi. But after Congress split in 1969, he opted for the rival faction, Congress (O). The story goes that Indira Gandhi called him on the phone and said, “Chacha aap saath aa jaiye (Uncle, please join us).” He replied, “Main tumhe apni beti manta hoon. Lekin main zubaan de chuka hoon, saath nahi aa paunga (I consider you my daughter. But I’ve given my word and can’t retract).” He lost in 1971 and passed away in 1978, becoming a footnote in India’s political history.Of late, Masuriya Din has prompted discussion among a new generation of Pasis on social media. Both BJP and Congress celebrated his birth anniversary, which incidentally falls on Oct 2, as part of their SC outreach. And this Feb, his statue was unveiled at Purab Pashchim Sharira village in adjoining Kaushambi constituency.“Masuriya Din was a major social reformer. He was hugely popular, especially among Pasis, the community he belonged to. He should have been a Union minister had the ruling leadership of the time been empathetic enough. Perhaps his lack of cultural capital caused this bias,” says political commentator Chandra Bhan Prasad.At a time when SCs were at the receiving end of extreme social inequities and financial deprivation, Masuriya Din’s vision in proactively promoting education and working on political changes to uplift his community needed greater appreciation and attention.After the heady Nehru-Masuriya Din days, Phulpur became the constituency of Nehru’s sister Vijaya Lak shmi Pandit — she won the bypolls after the PM’s death in 1964 — and V P Singh (1971). In 2004, mafia don-turnedpolitico Atiq Ahmed (SP) won here, bringing unwanted attention to the seat. Atiq was gunned down last year. In the post-Mandal era, Phulpur has often changed hands among BJP, SP and BSP, mostly electing MPs from OBC communities (Patel, Maurya).In 2024, all major parties have put up OBC faces for the seat that includes chunks of west and north Prayagraj. Praveen Patel, the current Phulpur MLA, is BJP’s candidate. Amarnath Maurya, a 54-year-old law graduate is SP’s contender while Jagannath Pal, a 63-year-old postgraduate in Hindi and a party veteran is BSP’s nominee. Patels, Brahmins, Baniyas and Muslims are numerically significant.Everyone’s talking in Phulpur. At a tea shop in Ghatampur village, a motley assemblage of Yadavs, Mauryas, Patels, Muslims, Thakurs, Pasi and other SC members openly declare who they will vote for and why. Qayimuddin, a plumber and SP voter, says, “Under Congress, gas cost Rs 450, while it’s at Rs 1,200 now. Janta baukhlayee (upset) hai.” he says. Vinod Kumar Yadav says govt institutions have weakened. Arbind Kumar Patel says, “Jahan Apna Dal, wohin Patel.” Apna Dal is part of the NDA. Harischandra and Ram Khelawan, both from the SC community, will vote for BSP. Only the Mauryas in the gathering don’t put their voting card on the table.A little away, a family says they get free foodgrains regularly and had got Rs 12,000 from the govt to build a toilet some years back. They are Pals, OBCs, and voted for “Modi” in 2019. They are not sure this time. Sushil Kumar Pal, 28, a commerce graduate, is unemployed. He finds the Congress manifesto attractive. “BJP manifesto doesn’t focus on jobs,” he says. Sushil lists exam paper leaks as a key issue. His sister, Seema Pal, preparing for sarkari jobs, talks about the huge unemployment around. His father Dheeraj asks, “Ram Mandir achcha hua, lekin kya vikas hua (Ram Mandir is nice but what about development)?” Others nod in agreement.","Masuriya Din was born into a deprived SC family and went to a govt school. He was jailed during the Salt Satyagraha (1930), and again in 1940 and 1942. He joined Congress on being urged by Motilal Nehru, says research scholar Pradeep Rawat.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110286237,imgsize-362359,width-400,resizemode-4/110286237.jpg"
Why all parties are courting women in Bengal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-all-parties-are-courting-women-in-bengal/articleshow/110286106.cms,"Steady rise in numbers

Race to make women happy

Not easy to win over

Vote chase gets toxic

For every 1,000 male voters on the 2024 Lok Sabha electoral rolls in West Bengal, 968 are women — an elusive lot that political parties are actively chasing this season. There has been an uptick in women’s poll turnout since 2019, sometimes even outpacing male voters. Political parties are now losing their sleep over this new constituency. Each party is trying to woo the emergent woman voter with freebies, guarantees and counter-guarantees, curating a gendersensitive narrative throughout the election campaign .The voter turnout figures for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls in Bengal was an eye-opener for political parties — women topped with a higher turnout rate in 18 of the 42 Lok Sabha constituencies in the state, helmed by a woman chief minister. This means that in these 18 seats, a higher proportion of women electors turned up to vote compared to their male counterparts. For instance, in Cooch Behar 82.4% of male electors and 85.3% of female electors voted in the elections.The same elections also saw women voters outnumbering men in gross votes polled in six Bengal Lok Sabha constituencies — Maldaha Uttar, Maldaha Dakshin, Jangipur, Baharampur, Murshidabad, and Ghatal. For instance, in Maldaha Uttar, 6.6 lakh men and 6.9 lakh women voted.Voting trends for 2024 LS polls show that there is no departure from this trend in at least the first three phases of polls (the state is voting in all seven phases). For example, according to data available with the returning officer and shared with the TOI, the Balurghat Lok Sabha constituency from where BJP Bengal president Sukanta Majumdar contested the polls, witnessed a higher turnout of women voters than men. The election commission is yet to release actual breakup of votes based on gender.Election Commission data is pivotal in understanding Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee’s Lakshmir Bhandar scheme , implemented for women from economically weaker sections of society, in 2021. The scheme, a monthly monetary support, benefits 2 crore women in Bengal where the total number of women voters is 3.73 crore.Just before Lok Sabha poll dates were announced, Mamata hiked the Lakshmir Bhanadar allowance to Rs 1,000 for the general category and Rs 1,200 for the SC/STs. It is to be seen if this direct cash support overrides other factors in the polls when it comes to influencing women voters.Those arguing the case cite the recently held assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka. The BJP benefited out of the Ladli Behna scheme among other freebies in MP while Congress reaped dividends after making a ‘Five Guarantee’ promise in its poll manifesto, which includes free bus rides for women (Shakti scheme), and Rs 2,000 for every woman head of the house (Gruhalakshmi). The Lakshmir scheme, implemented after the 2021 Bengal assembly polls, would be put to test in the LS polls.Though assembly polls do not match the grandeur of Lok Sabha elections, the principal Opposition in Bengal, BJP, is not discounting this factor. After Trinamool national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee told a rally in Basirhat Lok Sabha constituency that “no one can take away the Lakshmir Bhandar scheme as long as the Trinamool is in power”, Union home minister Amit Shah assured voters last week that “the BJP is not going to stop the Lakshmir Bhandar scheme”. “We will enhance it by Rs 100,” Shah had said.Bengal BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari took Shah’s statement a notch up, saying “BJP will give women Rs 100 a day” — which, if implemented, will make Lakshmir Bhandar payout Rs 3,000 a month. Adhikari also announced a similar scheme for Adivasis, Dalits and senior citizens. The Congress-Left combine, too, announced Mahalakshmi scheme, promising Rs 1 lakh yearly to women from poor families.The way political parties rival each other in scripting schemes for women only explains their desperation, and it could not finally have a huge impact on the ground. A look at the Election Commission data on the 2019 Lok Sabha elections doesn’t establish a direct correlation between women-oriented schemes and the election results in the 18 constituencies in which women voter turnout rate was higher. For instance, prior to Lakshmir Bhandar, the Bengal CM had announced Kanyashree (support for girl students) and Swasthya Sathi (family health card in the name of a woman member), in 2013 and 2016 respectively. But when the 2019 LS results were announced, of the 18 constituencies where women voter turnout surpassed that of men, Trinamool bagged nine seats while seven went to BJP and two to Congress.The competition among political parties to impress women voters goes off the track at times — as evident from what has been playing out in Sandeshkhali, a village in Bengal’s North 24 Parganas district.Sandeshkhali witnessed a groundswell after some women there lodged complaints of landgrabbing and sexual assault by local Trinamool leaders. The incident drew national attention and prompted the Calcutta High Court to take cognizance of the matter suo motu. A viral video later claimed sexual harassment complaints were doctored, which was followed by arrests of BJP functionaries. And the woman voter, evidently, lies at the heart of these slanging matches.","There has been an uptick in women’s poll turnout since 2019, sometimes even outpacing male voters.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Monday wrote to the Union home ministry, stating that the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) allegedly received foreign funds exceeding Rs 7 crore in violation of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA).The ED discovered this information during a money laundering investigation related to drugs, involving former Punjab AAP MLA Sukhpal Singh Khaira and others, said several media reports.The ED initiated the probe in 2021 and arrested Khaira, who has since joined the Congress.In August last year, the agency sent a detailed communication to the Union home ministry, highlighting the alleged violations by AAP and categorising them as contraventions of the FCRA and The Representation of the People Act.Recently, the ED shared additional information with the Ministry of Home Affairs ( MHA ).Media reports said the ED found that the AAP had received approximately Rs 7.08 crore in overseas donations to date. The agency alleged that the party ""mis-declared and manipulated"" the identities and nationalities of the foreign donors, as well as other details.The ED provided the MHA with verified information about the donors, including their nationalities, passport numbers, donation amounts, mode of donation, bank account numbers, billing details, and payment gateway used.The agency also reported that some fundraising events organised by the AAP's overseas wing volunteers in the USA and Canada between 2015 and 2016 were allegedly conducted in violation of the FCRA.In one specific instance, the ED claimed that the names and nationalities of some Canada-based individuals had been ""concealed"" in the party's financial records to ""hide"" the foreign donations being made to the party's Indian bank account.A senior official stated that cases of FCRA violations are investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), and the home ministry can request the CBI to look into the charges made by the ED.AAP leader Atishi hit back at ED's allegations, and said that this was yet another ploy by the BJP.""After the liquor scam and t he Swati Maliwal case failed to bring down AAP, the BJP has concocted this case ... this clearly shows the BJP is losing the 20 seats of Delhi and Punjab. This is not the ED's action ... but the BJP,"" said Atishi.The AAP leader said the ED's charges over foreign funding stem from a case that is 11 years old. ""This is a conspiracy by Modi to defame AAP,"" Atishi added.""I want to tell BJP and ED that since its formation, Aam Aadmi Party has given account of every single rupee to the Election Commission and the Income Tax Department,"" she said.","The Enforcement Directorate (ED) wrote to the Union home ministry, stating that the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) allegedly received foreign funds exceeding Rs 7 crore in violation of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) The ED discovered this information during a money laundering investigation related to drugs, involving former Punjab AAP MLA Sukhpal Singh Khaira.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110277435,imgsize-36548,width-400,resizemode-4/110277435.jpg"

AAP's counter allegations

Swati Maliwal's repsonse

NEW DELHI: Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal has accused the BJP of viewing the AAP as a threat, initiating what he said ""Operation Jhaadu"" to undermine his party. The Delhi CM held a press conference ahead of the protest march in the national capital saying the PM is trying to crush the Aam Aadmi Party.""The PM is determined to crush the Aam Aadmi Party,"" Kejriwal said, alleging that the operation includes arresting key AAP leaders, freezing the party's bank accounts, and closing their offices.Meanwhile, the security has been beefed up outside BJP headquarters in Delhi in view of the protest by Aam Aadmi Party leaders and workers in the national capital today. Paramilitary troopers, along with Delhi Police personnel, have been deployed to maintain law and order.Delhi Police have said the AAP leaders will not be allowed to march towards the BJP office as they did not seek prior permission for the protest.In the press conference before the protests, Arvind Kejriwal said, ""BJP and PM Modi have started 'Operation Jhaadu' so that we don't grow big and become a challenge to them. Through 'Operation Jhaadu', AAP's big leaders will be arrested, they are being arrested and in the coming days, AAP's bank accounts will be frozen.""This party poses a threat to the BJP, which is why they believe it's crucial to address it now,"" Kejriwal said.""ED's lawyer has already given this statement in court that soon after the election AAP's bank accounts will be frozen, he said that if they freeze our account now we will get sympathy... After election, they will freeze our accounts, our office will be cleared out and we will be brought to streets. These are the three plans made by BJP,"" he added.Delhi Police detained some AAP workers as they tried to march towards the BJP headquarters to protest against the arrest of party leaders.DCP Delhi Central, Harsha Vardhan Mandava said, ""Based on the information we received through social media and other channels, we have made preventive arrangements on DDU Marg to ensure that the law and order are maintained at all costs. We are focused and committed to making adequate security deployments and have barricades in place to ward off any attempt to disrupt law and order.""""Section 144 has been imposed on DDU Marg and there is no permission for any kind of protest here,"" he informed.Earlier in the day, Delhi Traffic Police also issued an advisory in view of the protest, informing that traffic will remain heavy at DDU Marg, IP Marg, Minto Road and Vikas Marg. It also said that DDU Marg may remain closed for traffic movement between 11 am to 2 pm and urged commuters to avoid these roads.In view of the protest, the Delhi Metro authority also has informed that the entry and exit at ITO Metro station will remain closed till further notice.The political slugfest escalated after Delhi Police on Saturday arrested Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal's ex-personal secretary, Bibhav Kumar in connection with the alleged assault on AAP MP Swati Maliwal at the CM's residence this week. The Ex-aide is also in five-day police custody after a ruling in the Tis Hazari Court late Saturday night.Hours after Kumar's arrest, Kejriwal held a press conference in which he announced his intention to march to the BJP office on Sunday, and dared the ""Prime Minister to send anyone he wants to jail"".""I along with my MLAs and MPs would go to the BJP office at noon tomorrow so that the Prime Minister can send anyone he wants to jail. The AAP is an idea. For as many AAP leaders you jail, the country would produce leaders a hundred times more,"" Kejriwal added.On Sunday, AAP on X said, ""Today at 12 noon, AAP leaders will march towards BJP headquarters under the leadership of CM Kejriwal.""The AAP has also alleged that Swati Maliwal was 'blackmailed' by the BJP to hatch a 'conspiracy' against the Delhi CM Kejriwal.

If you want me to go to jail choose the BJP, otherwise choose the AAP. They (BJP) are after us. They arrested Manish Sisodia, Satyendar Jain and me. Today they arrested my PA, now they will arrest Raghav Chadha, Atishi, Saurabh Bharadwaj,"" Kejriwal in a rally after Bhibav's arrest said.Meanwhile, BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla slammed Arvind Kejriwal's decision to march to the BJP office on Sunday, saying the chief minister is doing ""emotional(torture)"" instead of replying to questions on Maliwal's alleged assault.BJP has also accused AAP and senior leader Atishi Marlena for engaging in the character assassination of a “distressed woman”, called it deeply shameful.“From corruption to misconduct and then defamation... this has become the ideology of AAP, which is aligned with Bibhav Kumar, who has a criminal record. Arvind Kejriwal’s silence indicates that Bibhav is merely a pawn, with the Delhi CM himself being the true mastermind of the incident,” BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawala said.The police have said that they have recorded statements from at least 10 individuals, including staff members and security personnel, who were present at the CM's residence during the alleged assault on May 13. Bibhav Kumar's mobile phones have been confiscated, and they are investigating his communications with Maliwai. According to the police, Kumar has also deleted chats and other content from his phone. The Delhi Police have also gathered footage from eight CCTV cameras and the DVR from the chief minister's residence. An officer noted that there was no CCTV camera installed in the drawing room where the alleged assault took place.The Delhi Police in its remand paper submitted late Saturday evening seeking seven days custody of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's aide Bibhav Kumar regarding the alleged assault on AAP Rajya Sabha member Swati Maliwal said that it was a ""serious case"" where the ""brutal assault"" could have turned ""fatal"".Metropolitan Magistrate Gaurav Goyal, who sent Kumar to five-day police custody, was told by the investigating agency that he did not cooperate with the police and had been evasive in his replies.""This is a very serious case where a Member of Parliament, a public figure, has been brutally assaulted which could have been fatal. Despite specific questions, the accused has not cooperated in the investigation and has been evasive in his replies,"" said the remand paper signed by North District Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police Anjitha Chepyala.The remand application said that Maliwal's testimony before the magistrate was corroborated by the medical evidence.In the ongoing blame game following the assault case, AAP leader Atishi said that if the Delhi Police are truly impartial, they should also file an FIR based on Bibhav Kumar's counter complaint against Maliwal.AAP leader Saurabh Bharadwaj has said that ""senior BJP leaders are in touch with Swati Maliwal"".""When a woman makes such allegations, it seems that there must be truth in her words. We, too, felt the same in the case of Swati Maliwal. But when the video of the drawing room of the Chief Minister's residence came to light, something different was visible in it,"" he added.Taking to X,Swati Maliwal has alleged that a video of Bibhav Kumar allegedly assaulting her has been edited. ""Only 50 seconds (of the video) were released when I was fed up of explaining to the security guys. Now they have formatted the phone and deleted the entire video? CCTV footage is also missing! Even conspiracy has its limits!""(With inputs from agencies)","Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal has accused the BJP of viewing the AAP as a threat, initiating what he said ""Operation Jhaadu"" to undermine his party. The Delhi CM held a press conference ahead of the protest march in the national capital saying the PM is trying to crush the Aam Aadmi Party.

NEW DELHI: Keeping up the attack on AAP over the Swati Maliwal assault case, the BJP on Saturday accused the Kejriwal led party of subjecting their own party colleague Swati Maliwal tocharacter assassination).""AAP is calling their own MP a traitor. Earlier, ""Cheer Haran' happened, and now they are doing Charitra Haran"", BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawala said.Shehzad Poonawala also further said, ""Congress did not even invite the Aam Aadmi Party President to its election rally held in Delhi.This suggests that the incident involving the assault on the Rajya Sabha MP at the Chief Minister's residence has created unease within the Congress. However, Priyanka Gandhi tried to hush up the matter.""Amid the raging controversy, the Delhi Police earlier on Saturday arrested Bibhav Kumar, an aide of Kejriwal.Poonawalla taking a swipe, also said that AAP is essentially an ""anti-aurat party (anti-women party)"" and alleged past incidents of mistreatment of women involving its leaders.AAP is now busy in Maliwal's character assassination, too, he said.""AAP's corruption and misconduct is followed by disinformation. It has become the party's standard operating procedure,"" he said, comparing the Maliwal case with Draupadi's disrobing episode in the Mahabharata.The Delhi BJP chief also joined the attack and accused AAP leaders of circulating ""edited"" videos to tarnish the image of their own party MP Swati Maliwal, who has accused an aide of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal of assaulting her.It is regrettable that ""edited"" videos are being circulated on social media groups since Friday in an attempt to ""defame"" Maliwal who is a member of the Aam Aadmi Party, Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva claimed.""Now that the entire Aam Aadmi Party is tarnishing the image of Swati Maliwal, it's time Kejriwal comes forward and speaks on the matter,"" Sachdeva said.The AAP has accused Maliwal of lying and being involved in a BJP ""conspiracy"" to falsely implicate Delhi CM Kejriwal in a fabricated case during the elections.Sachdeva said that Kejriwal's aide has been arrested by police, many ""dirty pages"" of AAP's politics will become public.If the AAP is trying to implicate Maliwal by circulating ""edited"" videos, it would be better for the Delhi Police to immediately take possession of the complete CCTV footage of the chief minister's residence, Sachdeva said.He accused Maliwal of not being the first female leader of the AAP whom the party has defamed.Earlier, Sachdeva conducted interviews with Kiran Bedi, Shazia Ilmi, and Richa Pandey, all of whom have departed from the AAP.( With input from agency)","AAP is calling their own MP a traitor.

Election Commission's updated turnouts for 4 phases up votes by 1.07 crore,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/election-commissions-updated-turnouts-for-4-phases-up-votes-by-1-07-crore/articleshow/110218098.cms,"An analysis of turnout numbers put out by EC late night of the day of polling in each phase and the latest updated numbers shows that the difference could be nearly 1.07 crore votes over the first four phases of the 2024 Lok Sabha polls . That's an average of over 28,000 votes per constituency for the 379 that have finished polling.How do we reach this conclusion? The EC has been putting out data on turnout in various stages in each phase, apart from what is available 'real-time' on its app.The latest data put out on polling day in each phase has been for somewhere between 10.30 pm and 11.30 pm. The 'final' figures - which still do not include postal votes and which the EC app cautions are ""approximate trends"" - were put out 11 days after polling day for the first phase, and four days after polling for phase 2, 3 and 4.The final figures have been only very slightly different from figures put out typically late evening on the day after polling. However, they vary considerably from the data put out on polling night in several states. Since the EC has also put out numbers for the electorate in each constituency - though only after the first two phases and a controversy over the lack of any absolute numbers - and since the turnout data is correct to two decimal places, it is possible to get an approximation of the votes cast by working back (see graphic).Such calculation backward shows that the implied difference in number of votes for the two turnout figures was about 18.6 lakh for phase 1, 32.2 lakh for phase 2, 22.1 lakh for phase 3 and 33.9 lakh for phase 4, totalling up to 1.07 crore.The biggest variations were in Andhra Pradesh, 4.2 percentage points in turnout and 17.2 lakh in derived vote numbers, Maharashtra (2.4 percentage points and 16.7 lakh), Kerala (4.1 percentage points and 11.4 lakh) and Assam (4.2 percentage points and 10.3 lakh). In Assam's case, that translates to an average difference of over 73,000 per constituency. For Andhra Pradesh, the average is 69,000 and for Kerala 57,000. Karnataka at 51,000 and Maharashtra at 48,000 have also seen significant differences. The variation in the Hindi heartland states was on the lower side.","EC puts out data on turnout in various stages in each phase, apart from what is available'real-time' on its app. Latest data put out on polling day in eachPhase has been for somewhere between 10.30 pm and 11.30pm.

Just two phases of voting are left in the

Lok Sabha elections

. How has it been for Congress and the opposition?

Congress was routed in the North belt in the 2014 and 2019 elections. Is it showing some fight in these polls?

PM Narendra Modi and other BJP functionaries have lately been talking about political instability if the INDIA alliance comes to office. How do you counter it?

A consistent feature in the PM’s campaign after the first phase of voting has been the claim that Congress wants to favour Mus lims. What do you think is his objective, and how is it working on the ground?

Congress is contesting 326 seats, the lowest in the party’s history. Are you concerned about the message it has sent out to the people?

But what about the contradictions within the INDIA bloc, like Congress and Left being allies in Bengal and rivals in Kerala, and AAP being an ally in Delhi and rival in Punjab?

This election has seen serious charges levelled by the opposition against the conduct of Election Commission. Do you still have doubts about EVMs?

How has the wipeout of Congress in MP, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh in Dec assembly elections impacted the LS polls?

and threat to the Constitution and attack on democracy emerging as the top issues resonating with voters. BJP will not be able to return to office and opposition will form a stable govt at the Centre, he asserted.Excerpts from the interview:■ Compared to 2019, this election has been very good and we are scoring well in every state. I am confident that we will defeat BJP and stop it from coming to office. The grassroots’ feedback is that people are coming forward to fight this election and we are just helping them. So, BJP claim of “400-500 paar” is impossible. The PM is denting his image by telling such lies. People say high prices are hurting them. Youngsters who were till now tilted towards BJP are also complaining about joblessness. They are saying “if we don’t have the basics of survival, then what will we do?” And the weaker sections, Dalits, tribals, backwards are scared that a majority to BJP can result in a change of the Constitution and that even democracy may be under threat. They have resolved to fight to bring the non-BJP parties to power to save democracy and the Constitution. People are voting with a certain stubbornness on these two big issues.■ In Bihar, Congress-RJD is fighting against the BJP ideology, and the youth, the backwards, extremely backwards and Dalits are strongly backing the alliance. In UP, the BJP tally of 2019 will go down because SP and Congress are fighting unitedly while leaving no scope for any mutual mistrust. They are campaigning together and attracting people. The hard work of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Rahul Gandhi and Akhilesh Yadavwill shore up the opposition. In Rajasthan, we were wiped out in the last two elections, but we will get many seats this time. In MP, we will go up from one seat in 2019, and similarly in Chhattisgarh. We are getting a decent tally in Haryana, and in Punjab we will retain our tally. In Maharashtra, where we won just one seat, Congress will gain and the MVA alliance will get a good score. We are gaining in Telangana, Karnataka. In Kerala, we are winning, but whoever wins there, Congress or Left, will be against BJP. We are fighting well in Himachal and Uttarakhand. The fact is that we are gaining in every state while BJP is falling. So, how will BJP gain seats or come back to power?■ During the UPA terms, Congress won 140-odd and 206 seats, but Manmohan Singh govt ran for 10 years, and we were successful in bringing good policies like MGNREGA, RTI, RTE, NFSA and Indo-US nuclear deal. If you consider this, do you really think we cannot run a govt for five years? This is a bogey Modi is raising, despite the opposition having proved it for 10 years. Should I call the PM an intelligent person for such remarks?■ There is a Constitution in the country, and people are closely watching that Modi is speaking against it. The reservations for SC, ST, OBCs are in employment and education, while SC/ST also have political reservation. Nobody can snatch it from them. Then why try to scare the people? On the contrary, our serious charge is that BJP wants to take away the very Constitution to deprive the people of their rights. Look at how Modi has taken control of the media and how BJP extorted money through electoral bonds. The big issue here is dictatorship. He came to office through polarisation, by speaking lies. Has anybody’s property or mangalsutra been snatched away in 70 years. What the PM is claiming is juvenile and I sympathise with him. He thinks he will gain by provoking people, but it will not work, and is, instead, exposing him.■ We created a big alliance of 26 parties, and we had to give space to allies in states where they are strong. So, the message that has gone out is that we have formed a strong coalition to defeat BJP. There has to be give and take in an alliance. It is not an issue of who is contesting more seats or less, but about what has to be done to defeat BJP.■ There is a state wise strategy to defeat BJP. Whoever wins in Kerala will go against BJP. Similarly, we have allied with AAP in Delhi, Haryana, Gujarat, but in Punjab, Congress and AAP are the top two parties, and they cannot join hands. We worked out alliances strategically.■ Now, the Supreme Court has asked EC about the problem in making the voting data public without delay, which was our demand. The EC accused us of creating suspicion and sowing doubts in people’s minds, but the SC snubbed the EC. We have been proved correct. Also, we have been asking since the start why give such a protracted schedule of election. Voting has been held in the country in one day and elections completed in one week. But the EC gave two months for elections. It was to enable the PM to travel everywhere because he has the govt air travel. But what resources do other parties have to match him? Even before the elections, the PM travelled to many states in the name of inaugurations to seek votes. But whatever they may do, people understand that Modi is harassing and suppressing the opposition. Even Congress party funds were seized. A minor omission in the IT returns of names of donors involving Rs 14 lakh was used as a pretext to impose heavy penalties. Such actions erode people’s faith in elections. By not respecting the Constitution and by depriving the opposition of the level playing field, Modi’s autocratic attitude has vitiated the atmosphere of elections. I will not comment on EVMs because it will create a controversy in the middle of elections.■ People are regretting their vote in the assembly polls and that is the reason why Congress will get seats in Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and MP. Even in 2018, when we won the elections in these states and formed govts, we won 0-2 seats. But in the LS polls, people have whole-heartedly supported us, and we will get more seats in these states.","Mallikarjun Kharge is a leading campaigner for the opposition front, Congress.

NEW DELHI: Days after snubbing him for questioning TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee’s trustworthiness, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge heaped praise on the party’s West Bengal unit chief Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury on Monday, lauding him as a “ladaku sipahi” (combative soldier) of the grand old party.Kharge snubbed Chowdhury, a five-time Lok Sabha MP from Bahrampur in West Bengal, last week for his remarks that Banerjee cannot be trusted and that she might also go with BJP.“Woh hamarey ladaku sipahi hain (he is our combative solider),” Kharge said on Monday about Chowdhury, who has only intensified his offensive against Banerjee, the West Bengal chief minister, by alleging that she has used violence to crush the Congress in the state and has been helping BJP.Asked if Congress is making the same mistake with Chowdhury as it had made with Banerjee in 1998, when she quit the party to float her own outfit protesting against its coyness in the face of Left “atrocities” on its cadre in West Bengal, Kharge said, “I do not want to speak about an individual. He (Chowdhury) is a combative soldier of the Congress party and is our leader in West Bengal.”He said some TMC leaders are now trying to rake up the issue of Congress’s alliance with Left but it will not work.“They are trying to present it differently. But it will not happen like this as Congress party is strong and understands each other. What has happened in West Bengal is that the Congress brass has taken a decision to have a coalition with the Left and we are moving forward with that,” Kharge said.TMC is contesting the ongoing Lok Sabha polls on its own in the state, while the Congress and the Left are jointly fighting the election.Kharge on Saturday dismissed Chowdhury’s criticism of Banerjee while addressing a joint press conference with Shiv Sena (UBT) president Uddhav Thackeray and Nationalist Congress Party (SP) chief Sharad Pawar in Mumbai. pti","Mallikarjun Kharge and Adhir Chowdhury clashed over Mamata Banerjee's role in the INDIA bloc, resulting in ink being smeared on the AICC president's poster in Kolkata.

I can't belong to a bad organisation if I am a good person: Calcutta HC judge

I have treated everybody on a par — the rich, the poor, a Communist, or someone with BJP, Congress or Trinamool. All were equal before me Justice Chitta Ranjan Dash

KOLKATA: Justice Chitta Ranjan Dash of Calcutta HC caused a flutter Monday when he declared in his farewell speech before a full bench that he was free to work for RSS again after having distanced himself from it for 37 years for professional reasons even while remaining ideologically moored to the organisation.""To the distaste of some, I must admit here that I was and am a member of RSS.(But) I don't have any bias against anybody,"" Dash told the audience, just over two months after his controversial former colleague Abhijit Gangopadhyay resigned as a judge to join BJP and become the party's candidate for Tamluk Lok Sabha seat.""I am ready to go back to the organisation (RSS) if it calls me for any assistance for any work that I am capable of doing,"" said Dash, who was an HC judge for 15 years. The outgoing judge, third in seniority, added, ""I have never used my (RSS) membership for any advancement of my career, which is against the principles of my organisation.""Outgoing judge of Calcutta HC, Justice Chitta Ranjan Dash, said on Monday he ""had the courage to say I belong to the organisation (RSS) because that is not wrong. I cannot belong to a bad organisation if I am a good person"".In his farewell speech, Dash said, ""I have treated everybody on a par - the rich, the poor, a Communist, or someone with BJP, Congress or Trinamool. All were equal before me.""A division bench led by Dash stoked a controversy earlier this year with its observations in a case pertaining to sexual abuse of a minor, prompting Supreme Court to term these ""wrong and problematic"".""Adolescent girls must control their sexual urges instead of giving in to two minutes of pleasure,"" the bench said, leading SC to say that judges were supposed to decide a case based on the law and facts instead of resorting to preaching.""I don't have any bias against anybody - not against any political philosophy or mechanism. I tried to dispense justice based on two principles. The first is empathy, and the second is the law. The law can be bent to suit justice but justice cannot be bent to suit the law...I may have done wrong, I may have done right,"" Dash said at his farewell.He also spoke about the need for Calcutta HC to change some of its ""archaic"" rules. ""The Chief Justice needs the bar's cooperation. We have to march with time. We cannot look back at the past. We have to look ahead.""Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has often accused some HC judges of compromising the law. A day after the court's verdict in the cash-for-school jobs case last month, she said at an election rally, ""They have purchased everything. Courts have been purchased. I am not talking about the Supreme Court.""A division bench of Chief Justice T S Sivagnanam and Justice Hiranmay Bhattacharya admitted five petitions seeking suo motu action against the chief minister for allegedly insulting the judiciary.","Outgoing judge of Calcutta HC, Justice Chitta Ranjan Dash, said on Monday he ""had the courage to say I belong to the organisation (RSS) because that is not wrong.

It cited speeches by these two leaders to argue its case.A week later, Congress filed a complaint against Modi alleging violation of MCC, electoral and criminal laws. It gave details of PM’s poll speeches in the complaint. On April 21 and 23, CPI and CPI(ML) filed complaints against Modi with the poll body.On April 25, the poll panel simultaneously sent notices to both Congress president Kharge and BJP chief J P Nadda, asking them to respond by April 29. Both parties have submitted their response, and EC is yet to take any decision even as only two phases of Lok Sabha elections will remain after Monday's polling.The second case involves Andhra Pradesh CM and YSR Congress president Y S Jaganmohan Reddy and TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu.EC records show that Reddy filed a complaint against Naidu with the Andhra Pradesh chief election officer (CEO) on April 1 mentioning objectionable portions of his speeches and the CEO issued a show cause notice to the TDP leader on April 3. Naidu replied to the notice and did not deny the words and statements made against Reddy. Even after the notice, the CEO received complaints of the leader violating the MCC.In the case of the YSR Congress chief, TDP filed a complaint against him on April 5 alleging he used false statements against Naidu and violated the MCC. On April 7, the CEO issued a showcause notice to Reddy. The CM replied on April 9 and didn’t deny using the words and statements against his political rival. As per the EC document, the CEO received two more complaints against Reddy for violating MCC even after getting the notice.Finally, the CEO sent reports against both the leaders on April 22 and the EC on May 6 “censured” them with the direction to “remain careful” in their public utterances in future.EC sources said the poll body takes into consideration several factors before passing an order or initiating action. “It observes how leaders behave after showcause notices are served. Second, if it initiates action soon after getting a complaint against an opposition leader, you can imagine the allegations that will be levelled. Another major factor is to ensure that the poll process is smooth,” said a source.","In two cases involving high-profile leaders, the poll panel acted or passed orders the same day. The first case pertains to complaints against Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, party leader Rahul Gandhi and PM Narendra Modi. The second case involves Andhra Pradesh CM and YSR Congress president Y S Jaganmohan Reddy and TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110281531,imgsize-48908,width-400,resizemode-4/110281531.jpg"
