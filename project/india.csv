NEW DELHI: The Mumbai police have revealed that the plot to assassinate NCP leader and former Maharashtra minister Baba Siddiqui had started three months ago. The accused had visited Baba Siddiqui's residence multiple times without carrying any weapons, as per the Mumbai police.Based on the information obtained from the Mumbai Crime Branch, the entire plot to murder Baba Siddiqui was orchestrated in Pune.The Mumbai Crime Branch has recorded statements from over 15 individuals, including several eyewitnesses who were present at the scene of the incident.In connection with the murder of NCP leader Baba Siddique, the Mumbai Police has taken another individual into custody, alleging that he supplied funds and weapons for the crime. Harishkumar Balakram Nisad (23), originally from Bahraich in Uttar Pradesh, is the fourth person to be arrested in the case. On Tuesday, a court remanded him to police custody until October 21.""Nisad worked as a scrap dealer in Warje area of Pune city,"" said a police official. A team from the Mumbai crime branch apprehended him in Bahraich on Monday.Previously, the police had arrested Gurmail Baljit Singh (23) from Haryana, Dharmaraj Rajesh Kashyap (19) from Uttar Pradesh, both alleged shooters, and ""co-conspirator"" Pravin Lonkar from Pune.Shivkumar Gautam, another suspected shooter who also hails from Bahraich, remains at large.During Nisad's appearance before additional chief judicial magistrate V R Patil, the police informed the court that he had provided financial assistance to the co-accused and that further investigation was required to establish ""the upper link and lower link"" regarding the financial support and determine how he procured the weapons used in the crime.Nisad and Kashyap are from the same village as the wanted accused, Shivkumar Gautam.Ajay Dubey, Nisad's lawyer, opposed the remand plea, arguing that the accused was a ""victim of circumstances and a scapegoat."" However, the magistrate acknowledged the seriousness of the offence and deemed his custodial interrogation necessary.According to the police, Nisad, along with Kashyap, Gautam, Pravin Lonkar, and Pravin's brother Shubham, was involved in the conspiracy to kill Siddique.On Saturday night, Baba Siddique (66), a former Congress leader who had recently joined the Nationalist Congress Party, was ambushed by three individuals in Mumbai's Nirmal Nagar area, just outside the office of his MLA son Zeeshan Siddique , and shot.The Mumbai crime branch has assembled various teams to apprehend Shivkumar Gautam, accused Mohammed Zeeshan Akhtar, and other individuals wanted in connection with the case.According to officials, the crime branch is exploring various angles, including the possibility of a contract killing, business or political rivalry, or threats related to a slum rehabilitation project.","Harishkumar Balakram Nisad (23), originally from Bahraich in Uttar Pradesh, is the fourth person to be arrested in the case.

"Nayab Singh Saini gets backing of Haryana MLAs, to take oath as CM today",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nayab-singh-saini-gets-backing-of-haryana-mlas-to-take-oath-as-cm-today/articleshow/114294202.cms,"CHANDIGARH: Nayab Singh Saini , who was, as expected, elected leader of BJP legislature party, will take oath as Haryana CM Thursday, a date chosen by PM Modi to mark anniversary of sage Valmiki.Home minister Amit Shah enlisted the party's senior-most legislator Anil Vij, who had staked claim to the CM's post during the campaign, to propose Saini's name during a 30-minute meeting of newly-elected MLAs at BJP headquarters in Panchkula Wednesday.""MLAs Krishan Kumar Bedi and Anil Vij proposed the name of Saini which was approved by all. I announce Saini as the leader of the legislature party,"" Shah said.On March 12, when BJP named Saini as Manohar Lal Khattar's successor during a meeting held at Haryana Niwas, Chandigarh, Vij had abruptly left the meeting, abandoned his security and took a private car to reach his residence in Ambala. Rumours swirled that Vij, a seasoned neta, was unwilling to accept the junior Saini as his superior. Further signalling his discontent, Vij declined any ministerial roles in Saini's cabinet after the latter took oath on March 13.Although Vij and Union minister Rao Inderjit Singh had indicated during the campaign that they were contenders for CM's job, the leadership always appeared to be favourably inclined towards Saini. Though backed by Khattar, Saini's affable style and accessibility helped sand out the unpleasant memories of the two tenures of his predecessor who had earned goodwill by bringing transparency in recruitment to put an end to the ""cash-for-jobs"" scheme widely perceived to have been rampant under Congress's decade-long run, but whose ""rough and brusque"" style during his second term created a wall between the government and the people. Saini managed to bridge that gap, while his OBC background turned out to be a big electoral plus.Besides backing of OBCs, support of Dalits played a major role in BJP's surprise victory and Modi's choice of Valmiki Jayanti for the swearing-in is seen simultaneously as a thanksgiving gesture to Dalits and a celebration of the defeat of Congress's narrative that BJP was plotting to abolish caste quotas.Sources said Modi pencilled in the birth anniversary of the author of Ramayana as soon as he was presented with a set of options.The PM also scheduled a meeting of CMs and deputy CMs of 16 NDA-governed states in Chandigarh on Thursday. Leaders of all NDA parties will be present in what is expected to be a major show of strength before the Maharashtra and Jharkhand polls.At the BJP meeting, Shah said it was the first time that a party had returned to office for the third time in a row in Haryana and credited Modi for the victory. ""Since our PM had been in-charge of the state for BJP, he has great understanding about the needs, issues and problems of the people of Haryana. When he was sworn in as PM for the first time, we decided to fight polls without any alliances and formed the government. Khattar worked for nine-and-a-half years before the party utilised his services at the Centre and appointed Saini as the CM. Now, we have contested and won the election under his leadership,"" Shah said.Others present in the meet included BJP's poll in-charge for Haryana Dharmendra Pradhan and co-in-charge Biplab Deb, Union ministers Khattar & Rao Inderjit Singh.Hours after the meeting, Saini met Haryana governor Bandaru Dattatreya and staked claim to form the government.",Nayab Singh Saini will take oath as Haryana CM Thursday. PM Modi chose date to mark anniversary of sage Valmiki. Home minister Amit Shah enlisted the party's senior-most legislator Anil Vij. Vij had staked claim to the CM's post during the campaign.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114294247,imgsize-1524532,width-400,resizemode-4/114294247.jpg"

Congress is likely to promise an increase in the cash amount paid under the scheme.The party first adopted the ""guarantee-based approach"" in the 2022 Himachal polls, which also marked its first victory since December 2018 when it swept Chhattisgarh, MP and Rajasthan.

Devendra Fadnavis Hints at Mahayuti’s Chief Minister Face,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sitting-here-maharashtra-deputy-cm-devendra-fadnavis-hints-at-mahayutis-chief-minister-face/articleshow/114278249.cms,"NEW DELHI: Maharashtra deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said that the ruling Mahayuti alliance does not need to announce its candidate for CM post, as the “chief minister is right here” without naming anyone.Speaking at a joint press conference with chief minister Shinde and deputy CM Ajit Pawar by his side, Fadnavis declared, “Our chief minister is sitting right here.”In a pointed challenge to the opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), he said, ""The MVA isn't announcing their CM face because they themselves don't believe their candidate will be able to take the position post-elections.I challenge Pawar Sahab to declare their candidate for the CM post.""Fadnavis did not hold back as he further criticised the MVA, which comprises the Congress, the Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray), and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) under Sharad Pawar.He accused the previous MVA government of corruption and misconduct, saying, ""This is the alliance whose home minister was jailed for accepting a bribe of Rs 100 crore, who planted bombs outside a businessman’s house, and who jailed journalists. They are in no position to lecture us on law and order. In their tenure, Nirbhaya Squad vehicles, meant to protect women, were used to escort their leaders. These people, who failed to ensure women’s safety, should not be preaching to us about Nari Shakti.""Fadnavis also highlighted the Mahayuti’s plans for the upcoming elections, saying, ""We have already rolled out several schemes, made financial provisions, and set the budget for these programs. In addition, our manifesto will include new schemes and benefits for everyone.""Echoing Fadnavis, chief minister Eknath Shinde took aim at the MVA, urging them to announce their leader for the opposition. “Our two years of governance and performance is the face of our alliance. Let the MVA declare their face,” Shinde said. He stressed the Mahayuti’s governance record, adding, “Presenting a report card of your government’s performance after two years is no easy task. It requires actual work and accomplishments.”During the press conference in Mumbai, the trio—Shinde, Fadnavis, and Ajit Pawar—released the Mahayuti government's report card, highlighting their achievements over the past two years.As Maharashtra braces for the upcoming Vidhan Sabha elections, the battle lines between the two major alliances—Mahayuti and the Maha Vikas Aghadi—are clearly drawn. The election marks the first direct contest between these coalitions since the splits within both the Shiv Sena and the NCP.The MVA, consisting of Congress, the Shiv Sena (UBT), and NCP (Sharad Pawar), is keen on replicating its recent Lok Sabha success. On the other hand, the Mahayuti, which includes the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Shiv Sena faction led by Shinde, and the NCP faction under Ajit Pawar, aims to retain power, banking on its populist schemes targeting women and youth.Maharashtra politics has seen dramatic shifts since the 2019 Vidhan Sabha elections, where the BJP secured 26.1% of the votes, the Congress 16.1%, the NCP 16.9%, and the Shiv Sena 16.6%.","Devendra Fadnavis said that the ruling Mahayuti alliance does not need to announce its candidate for CM post.

The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections , which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases. The results will be declared on November 23, along with Maharashtra.In the Tribal-dominated state, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and CM Hemant's Soren Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) are in a direct fight, while the Congress party and Lalu Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) are in alliance with the JMM.The JMM-Congress-RJD alliance are also reportedly seeking to deal with Left parties, Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party and other tribal outfits that have been contesting the elections in the state as independent entities and make efforts to field candidates against the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) on all 81 seats collectively.In the last assembly polls in 2019, the JMM-Congress-RJD alliance won a comfortable majority of 47 seats in a House of 81.The BJP slipped to 25 seats from 37 it held in 2014. The poor performance was perceived to be the outcome of its decision to contest alone backfiring. The party did not foster an alliance with the Ajsu in the 2019 polls when Raghubar Das, currently the Odisha governor, was serving the state as CM.In this year's Lok Sabha polls in Jharkhand, the BJP-led NDA secured nine out of the 14 seats, with the BJP winning eight and its alliance partner, the Ajsu (All Jharkhand Students Union) Party, retaining its single seat.On the other hand, the opposition India bloc improved its tally, increasing its seat count from two in 2019 to five in the parliamentary polls.BJP and JMM have spruced up their pace of campaigning from the ground zero to social media. BJP and JMM leaders are actively rebutting and challenging each other on a range of issues, including illegal immigration, youth welfare, employment and housing.INDIA bloc parties in Jharkhand slammed the EC for holding assembly elections in the state along with that of Maharashtra but claimed that they were ready to slug it out with BJP-led NDA, which has welcomed the announcement of poll dates.JMM, Congress, and CPI (ML-L) said the announcement showed that EC was in a hurry to conduct elections though the assembly tenure was due to end in January next year.Also, both the INDIA bloc and BJP-led NDA are expected to get into huddles to discuss the modalities of seat-sharing which is going to be a challenge for both the competing teams.","The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections, which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra. Elections in Maharashtra will be held in single phase on November 20. The counting of votes will be on November 23.Maharashtra is gearing up for elections as the two major political alliances—the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) and the Mahayuti—prepare to face each other for the first time in a Vidhan Sabha election.The Maha Vikas Aghadi, comprise of the Congress, the Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray), and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) under Sharad Pawar, will go head-to-head with the Mahayuti , which includes the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Shiv Sena faction led by Eknath Shinde, and the NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar. This will be the first electoral contest between these two alliances since the splits within the Shiv Sena and NCP.The MVA is hopeful of replicating its recent Lok Sabha success, while the Mahayuti aims to retain power by leveraging its populist schemes targeted at women and youth. Both alliances have set their sights on winning the state.Narayan Rane, a former Union Minister and the victor in the Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg Lok Sabha constituency, is poised to be a key figure for the BJP in the Konkan region during the forthcoming elections. Meanwhile, two constituencies are expected to be critical battlegrounds: chief minister Eknath Shinde's Kopri-Pachpakdi seat in Thane City and Worli in Mumbai, where Aaditya Thackeray, a leader of the Shiv Sena (UBT), is seeking reelection.In the last Vidhan Sabha elections in 2019, the BJP secured 26.1% of the votes, the Congress 16.1%, the NCP 16.9%, and the Shiv Sena 16.6%. The BJP and the Shiv Sena (then united) formed the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which secured a majority. However, the coalition soon crumbled due to disagreements over government formation, plunging the state into a political crisis.After no party could establish a government, Maharashtra was placed under President's rule. Devendra Fadnavis was briefly sworn in as chief minister, with Ajit Pawar as deputy chief minister. However, both resigned just days later before a scheduled floor test.By November 28, 2019, a new coalition emerged, with the Shiv Sena (Uddhav faction), NCP (Sharad Pawar faction), and Congress forming the Maha Vikas Aghadi government, led by Uddhav Thackeray as chief minister.The state's politics took another turn in June, 2022, when Uddhav Thackeray resigned following a rebellion within the Shiv Sena, led by Eknath Shinde, who then allied with the BJP. Eknath Shinde assumed the role of chief minister, with Devendra Fadnavis returning as deputy chief minister.",The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra. Elections in Maharashtra will be held in single phase on November 20. The counting of votes will be on November 23.

Since they couldn't find a suitable space for live practice, they relied on YouTube videos for nearly four weeks to learn loading and unloading techniques.Another alleged conspirator, Shubham Lonkar, had been under police surveillance until September 24, after being questioned in June about a shooting incident outside actor Salman Khan’s residence.Shubham was suspected of having ties to the Lawrence Bishnoi gang.In January, Shubham was arrested under the Arms Act in Akola, Maharashtra, where over ten firearms were seized. He was later released on bail.He had also been in contact with Lawrence Bishnoi’s brother Anmol before disappearing on September 24.The investigation further revealed that the accused used social media platforms like Snapchat and Instagram to communicate, with Shubham recommending these apps to evade surveillance due to features like Snapchat's automatic message deletion.Authorities continue their efforts to capture Gautam and uncover more details of the case.","Suspected shooter Shivkumar Gautam first learned firearm handling during celebratory firings at weddings in Uttar Pradesh.
