"Madras High Court: Girl, 14, jumps off Madras high court building after it orders authorities to send her to govt shelter",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/custody-clash-ends-in-courtroom-shock-madras-hc-orders-shelter-home-stay-for-teen-she-jumps-from-1st-floor-minutes-later/articleshow/123272940.cms,"CHENNAI: Upset with a Madras high court order to send her to a govt home, a 14-year-old girl tried to escape from police by jumping from the court's first floor on Tuesday. She was in court to tell the judges whether she wanted to live with her divorced father or mother.Minutes after a division bench of Justices M S Ramesh and V Lakshminarayanan pronounced the order, the girl tried to escape by jumping off the first-floor corridor of Court No 5, clutching a wire. The girl, who suffered injuries due to the fall, was rescued by police and rushed to the Rajiv Gandhi Govt General Hospital (RGGGH) in an ambulance stationed in the court.The issue pertains to a complaint made by M K Nair with the Neelankarai police alleging that his daughter was missing. Since considerable time had lapsed and the girl could not be secured, he moved a habeas corpus plea in high court. During the pendency of the petition, the girl was traced and produced before the court.The bench was informed that the girl had gone to her grandmother's house in the Andamans and was residing with her since she did not want to live with either her father or mother, who are divorced and living separately.In view of the wish expressed by the minor girl, the court subjected her to counselling before the Tamil Nadu Mediation and Conciliation Centre on the HC campus.However, the mediation talks failed, and the special counsellor's confidential report submitted to the court recorded that the child may require specialised counselling from a psychiatrist.When the judges interacted with the girl, she said she wanted to live with her mother in the Andamans. ""However, from the confidential report, we are of the view that there would not be a conducive atmosphere for the minor girl to safely reside in the Andamans. Since the girl said that she does not want to live with her father, the only alternative left to us is to direct her to be put in a safety home,"" the court said.The court then directed police to ensure that the girl is safely admitted to Govt Children's Home for Girls, Kellys, Chennai, by Aug 12. ""During her stay there, the petitioner shall accompany his minor daughter and produce her before Dr Venkat, psychiatrist attached to the Institute of Mental Health, Ayanavaram Road, Kilpauk, by Aug 13 and on any other subsequent dates, as specified by the specialist,"" the bench said.""We request Dr Venkat, psychiatrist, to submit an interim report on his evaluation in a sealed cover. The psychiatrist is also at liberty to counsel the father, who has not been living with his daughter for a very long time.It is made clear that the cost of medical fees and other expenses of the minor girl and the petitioner shall be borne by the petitioner.During the stay of the girl at the govt home, her mother/grandmother are at liberty to visit her during the permissible hours,"" the court added and adjourned the hearing to Aug 26.","14-year-old girl tried to escape from police by jumping from the court's first floor on Tuesday.

NEW DELHI: Heavy rains wreaked havoc in the national capital on Thursday, claiming three lives within 12 hours and leaving parts of the city paralysed by waterlogging, fallen trees and traffic chaos.In southwest Delhi’s Vasant Vihar, two boys died after a wall collapsed on them in Basant Nagar near Hanuman Mandir around 4.40 pm. Police said they received a call about the incident and rushed to the spot along with a disaster management team.A 10-year-old boy from Begusarai, Bihar, and a 9-year-old boy from Madhubani, Bihar, were pulled from the debris and taken to AIIMS Trauma Centre in PCR vans.Both of them were declared dead upon arrival, deputy commissioner of police (Southwest) Amit Goel said.Police said the boys were sitting on stairs next to the wall when it suddenly collapsed.According to the DCP, the wall, owned by the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), is suspected to have been weakened by prolonged rain and waterlogging in the area.Police said the debris was being cleared to prevent any further inconvenience.They added that the DDA had been informed and would conduct a detailed inspection to assess the structural safety of surrounding walls.The bodies have been kept for post-mortem, and legal formalities are in progress.Earlier in the day, a massive old neem tree uprooted and fell on vehicles in South Delhi’s Kalkaji area, killing a man and injuring his daughter. The incident took place around 9.50 am in B-Block, where Sudhir Kumar, 50, and his daughter Priya, 22, were riding a motorcycle that got crushed under the fallen tree.Both were rushed to Safdarjung Trauma Centre in critical condition, but Kumar could not survive. Priya suffered a pelvic fracture and is undergoing treatment.Authorities have urged residents to remain cautious as heavy rains continue to lash the city, bringing down trees, flooding streets and disrupting normal life.After the rain-related deaths came to light, AAP leader Atishi called for the resignation of Delhi PWD minister Parvesh Verma, holding him responsible for the deaths and accusing the BJP government of failing to prepare for the monsoon.""This is not the first such death, the toll from rain-related incidents has now risen to 20. Who is responsible for this?"" she asked, talking to PTI.She alleged that there had been no preparation for the rains, which had led to widespread waterlogging, trees collapsing and vehicles getting stuck in underpasses.“Parvesh Verma must take responsibility and resign. If he is not resigning, chief minister Rekha Gupta should remove him from the post,” she said.She called the situation in the national capital the result of the “failure of BJP’s four engines.”Atishi further claimed that even with all powers in its hands, the ruling party had failed to safeguard citizens during the monsoon.","Two boys died after a wall collapsed on them in southwest Delhi's Vasant Vihar.

Seeking a restraint on such detentions, he was told by a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi that the court would first consider the states' responses before passing any interim order.

‘Non-application of mind’: What Supreme Court observed while cancelling Kannada actor Darshan’s bail; pulls up Karnataka HC for giving ‘acquittal order to accused’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/non-application-of-mind-what-supreme-court-observed-while-cancelling-kannada-actor-darshans-bail-pulls-up-karnataka-hc-for-giving-acquittal-order-to-accused/articleshow/123315703.cms,"Misconduct & influence

BENGALURU: Cancelling the bail granted to Kannada actor Darshan and his six aides in the Renukaswamy murder case, the Supreme Court Thursday observed that the order of the Karnataka high court depicted ""non-application of the mind"".The apex court noted that courts are not expected to render findings on the merits of the case at the bail stage. On Dec 13, 2024, the high court single bench judge Justice S Vishwajith Shetty granted regular bail to Darshan (accused number 2), Pavithra Gowda (accused no 1) along with other accused - R Nagaraju, Anu Kumar alias Anu, Lakshman M, Jagadeesh alias Jagga and Pradoosh S Rao - on grounds of non-furnishing of a memo for reasons of arrest as per the mandate of CrPC, several inconsistencies in statements of witnesses, etc.The state govt challenged the verdict. Now, after 244 days, the Supreme Court reversed the order.During the course of hearing the appeals, the SC bench of Justices JB Paridiwala and R Mahadevan even remarked that the high court had handed out ""an acquittal order to the accused"".The bench, in the 66-page order, stated: ""In the present case, the high court failed to properly evaluate the nature of allegations, involving premeditated murder and conspiracy, attracting Section 302 of IPC read with Section 120B IPC; the chain of circumstantial evidence, including CCTV footage, call records and forensic report showing a deliberate attempt to destroy evidence (e.g.,disposal of blood-stained clothes and vehicle cleaning); and the incriminating role of A2 (Darshan), who was in constant touch with A1 (Pavithra Gowda) and other co-accused before and after the incident, and who facilitated the conspiracy and cover-up. On the other hand, it simply recorded that A2 (Darshan) had 'no direct role' and there was 'no prima facie case', without discussing or analysing the incriminating material on record. This amounts to non-application of mind and renders the order unsustainable in law.""By treating Darshan's stature as a mitigating factor, the high court committed a ""manifest perversity"" in the exercise of its discretion, thereby warranting cancellation of bail.""A2 is not a common undertrial. He enjoys celebrity status, mass following, political clout and financial muscle. His conduct inside jail - including recorded instances of VIP treatment, violations of jail rules and registered FIRs for misuse of facilities - reflects his capacity to defy the system even while in custody. If a person can subvert the prison system, the risk of interference with evidence, threatening or influencing witnesses and tampering with the course of justice is both real and imminent,"" the top court observed.Moreover, Darshan's immediate return to social events sharing the stage with prosecution witnesses, and continued influence over police witnesses, despite being on bail, establish that his liberty is a threat to the integrity of the proceedings, the court noted.""Granting leniency to such persons despite grave charges of conspiracy and murder sends the wrong message to society and undermines public confidence in the justice system. Accordingly, the accused's antecedents, influence, jail misconduct, and the seriousness of the charges against him make him unfit for bail,"" the SC stated.The apex court noted that on a cumulative analysis, it is evident that the high court suffers from serious legal infirmities. The order fails to record any special or cogent reasons for granting bail in a case involving charges under Sections 302, 120B and 34 of IPC. Instead, it reflects a mechanical exercise of discretion, marked by significant omissions of legally relevant facts.Moreover, the high court undertook an extensive examination of witness statements at the pre-trial stage, highlighting alleged contradictions and delays - issues that are inherently matters for the trial court to assess through cross-examination. The trial court alone is the appropriate forum to evaluate the credibility and reliability of witnesses, the SC observed.","Kannada actor Darshan and his six aides were granted bail in the Renukaswamy murder case.
