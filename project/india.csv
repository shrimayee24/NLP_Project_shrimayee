"Bihar elections: Smallest member of opposition bloc, but with victory under its belt",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-elections-smallest-member-of-opposition-bloc-but-with-victory-under-its-belt/articleshow/125374479.cms,"Bihar Assembly Poll Results: NDA Touches 200-Seat Lead, Congress Intensifies SIR, Vote Chori Attacks

NEW DELHI: The smallest member of Mahagathbandhan in Bihar has made its presence felt in an otherwise trainwreck of an election for the opposition. In a state crowded with sub-regional satraps who are identified with their castes, I P Gupta of Indian Inclusive Party has come into the limelight by successfully mobilising members of castes that have long been on the margins.Gupta (55) won from Saharsa by defeating his BJP rival by over 2,000 votes, marking a successful electoral debut for his party which had contested three seats as an MGB constituent.It was an outcome that eluded better-known parties helmed by much bigger names. Jan Suraaj Party of Prashant Kishor and Vikashsheel Insaan Party of Mukesh Sahani, the latter an RJD ally like Gupta, are two such examples. While Kishor fielded candidates in over 235 seats, VIP contested 12. Both parties drew a blank.Gupta quit Congress in 2023 to champion the cause of Tanti-Tatwa which falls under Extremely Backward Classes and is estimated to be 1-2% of the population, and pushed for a separate quota for them along with members of the Paan community. He blamed the state's NDA govt for the Supreme Court verdict that had overturned the move to grant SC quota to Tanti-Tatwa (historically weavers) and put the community back in the EBC category.He showed a knack for mobilisation by organising a successful rally in Patna's huge Gandhi Maidan in April, coming to the notice of parties of all hues in the election year. He said he was contacted by formations from across the political spectrum, from NDA to AIMIM and MGB, before he reached a deal with the opposition alliance. He held meetings with Rahul Gandhi and Tejashwi Yadav and accused NDA of trying to sabotage his politics while holding talks with him.An engineer who ran a business before plunging into politics, Gupta's stock is likely to rise in a state where mobilisation along caste lines is central to political shifts.","I P Gupta of Indian Inclusive Party has come into the limelight by successfully mobilising members of castes that have long been on the margins.

Congress ex-MP links Delhi blast to 'injustice' in Kashmir,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-ex-mp-links-delhi-blast-to-injustice-in-kashmir/articleshow/125397875.cms,"NIA Arrests Alleged Aide Of ‘Suicide Bomber’ Umar Nabi In Delhi Terror Attack

NEW DELHI: Former Congress MP Husain Dalwai sparked a controversy Monday by linking the Nov 10 Red Fort blast to ""injustice"" in Kashmir and questioning its occurrence during the Bihar elections , drawing instant condemnation from BJP as it targeted the opposition party for its ""justification"" of the terror act.Dalwai asked why such incidents occur during elections and demanded a probe into this, a remark that seemed to suggest that the blast was timed to coincide with the Bihar polls' second phase of voting (Nov 11).He then went on to allege that injustice is being done in Kashmir, which will have some consequences.BJP hit back at Congress, accusing the party of speaking the language of separatists in Kashmir. ""MMC (Muslim League Mao Congress) justifies Red Fort blast. Quotes former home minister P Chidambaram in defence. Shame,"" said BJP spokesperson Amit Malviya using the description that PM Narendra Modi used post-Bihar polls to attack Congress.Malviya's colleague, Shehzad Poonawalla lashed out at the Congress leader for refusing to condemn ""Islamic jihad"". ""After Mehbooba Mufti, now Hussian Dalwai jumps in to become a spin doctor for terror. In a sense he gives clean chit to the Delhi blast accused,"" he said.As his remarks drew criticism, Dalwai sought to clarify it and said there is no doubt that terrorists were behind the blast and that he can never support violence. He, however, stuck to his assertion about alleged injustice in Kashmir and said the govt should not target an entire community.","Former Congress MP Husain Dalwai sparked a controversy Monday by linking the Nov 10 Red Fort blast to ""injustice"" in Kashmir.

NEW DELHI: A day before scrutiny of nomination papers for the Maharashtra civic body elections is scheduled to begin, Supreme Court on Monday said it would not permit total reservations for SC, ST and OBCs to exceed the 50% limit, and warned that it would stop the nomination process in those constituencies where quota breached the ceiling.Appearing for certain petitioners, senior advocate Vikas Singh said there are civic bodies in which the 27% reservation for OBCs took the total quota beyond the 50% ceiling in violation of SC's May 6 order, which had directed Election Commission to follow the OBC reservation specifications as existed before the Banthia Commission's report of July 2022.SC said since recommendations of the Banthia Commission have not yet been fully crystallised by the state govt, the elections to local bodies - 409 urban local bodies and over 28,000 rural local bodies - will be held as per the OBC reservation applicable to constituencies prior to July 2010.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta and senior advocate Shekhar Naphade told a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi that the process of scrutiny of nomination papers commences from Tuesday and that it was not appropriate for the petitioners to move court at this late stage. ""Do not exceed the 50% limit, we have not permitted this. We never allowed the reserved seats to exceed 50% of the total seats,"" the bench repeatedly told Mehta, who requested for adjournment. The bench posted the matter for further hearing on Wednesday.While allowing the short adjournment, the bench said it would stall the process for all civic bodies where that the total reserved seats was found to exceed 50%.","Supreme Court on Monday said it would not permit total reservations for SC, ST and OBCs to exceed the 50% limit.
