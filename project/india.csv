NEW DELHI: After Rahul Gandhi called out Congress insiders for supporting the BJP in Gujarat, former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Digvijaya Singh asked when Gandhi would take action against those inside enemies. ""When will Rahul Gandhi expel BJP supporters from Congress?"" posted the former CM of Madhya Pradesh on X.Rahul Gandhi, while addressing party workers in Ahmedabad on Saturday, suggested that some were ""cut off"" from the people and half of them were ""in cahoots"" with the BJP. ""The leadership of Gujarat, the workers of Gujarat, the district presidents (Congress) of Gujarat, the block presidents, there are two types of people in them, there are divisions. One stands with the people, fights for people, respects the people and has the ideology of the Congress party in his heart. The other is the one who is cut off from the people, sits far away, does not respect the people and half of them are in cahoots with the BJP. Until we do not separate these two, the people of Gujarat cannot believe in us,"" Gandhi said.Recalling his own experience in Gujarat, Digvijaya Singh said when he was campaigning as the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh, he was instructed to not speak against RSS. He was told Hindus would get angry if he said anything against the RSS. ""The Sangh does not represent the Hindus. It only misleads and exploits the Hindus in the name of religion,"" Digvijaya said adding that the Hindus have Shankaracharyas as their leaders. ""The tradition of Shankaracharyas, the Hindu spiritual leaders, has been established for thousands of years and continues to this day. Which of these Shankaracharyas support @BJP4India and @RSSorg today?"" said the Congress MP.The BJP dismissed Rahul Gandhi's statement and said he should first understand that he is responsible for the party's defeat. ""He said more than half of his party leaders were in cohorts with the BJP while he got his party defeated in more than 90 elections. In this sense, he is the biggest asset of the BJP,"" BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla said. ""He said that(horses supposed to be deployed in a race were used in the groom's procession to a wedding,"" Poonawalla said and asked, ""Was it a question on the leadership of Mallikarjun Kharge (Congress president)?...Is Rahul Gandhi eyeing Kharge ji's chair (position in party)?""","Former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Digvijaya Singh asked when Gandhi would take action against those inside enemies.
