LUCKNOW: A woman scrolling through adult content online was shocked to find that a person in a video — dressed as a woman and engaged in explicit acts with another man — looked like her husband, a govt doctor posted in Sant Kabir Nagar district.Lodging an FIR, the woman claimed that the videos, uploaded under a pseudonym, were hosted on paid adult platforms. She insisted that the man in the video, donning a wig and women's clothes and performing lewd acts, was her husband who had monetized adult content.The complainant said that the decor and furniture visible in the videos matched the interiors of their official residence at the district jail complex in Khalilabad (Sant Kabir Nagar), where the couple previously lived. She claimed she herself selected the wallpaper, curtains, and furnishings seen in the footage, and claimed the house could have been used as a makeshift studio.The woman alleged in the FIR that the situation turned violent when she confronted him at their home in Gorakhpur on May 18. Her father and brother confronted the doctor at his residence in Khalilabad after which a scuffle broke out which was captured in CCTV.""
