NEW DELHI: Amid the ongoing stalemate over seat-sharing arrangements in the Mahayuti alliance over at least four seats in Mumbai and adjoining areas, senior BJP functionaries, including Maharashtra deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis and state president Chandrashekhar Bawankule on Wednesday called on Union home minister Amit Shah to explore possible solutions.BJP released its first list of 99 candidates last Sunday after which Shiv Sena workers opposed BJP candidates in at least four seats, including Kalyan East , Thane, Navi Mumbai and Murbad.They have threatened not to campaign for BJP candidates in these constituencies, which could have a ripple effect in other constituencies in the region as well. In Kalyan East, BJP has fielded Sulabha Gaikwad, wife of sitting MLA Ganpat Gaikwad.Gaikwad is currently in jail for allegedly firing on Shiv Sena neta Mahesh Gaikwad inside a police station. Sena functionaries have opposed Sulabha Gaikwad's nomination since the beginning.Shiv Sena workers are also not happy with BJP's decision to field Sanjay Kelkar in Thane, who is considered Shiv Sena chief and CM Eknath Shinde's stronghold. Besides this, they are opposing the candidature of Ganesh Naik in Airoli in Navi Mumbai and Kishan Kathore in Murbad constituency.Sources said Sena leadership isn't ready to accede to BJP's decision of contesting the above seats and is contemplating fielding is own candidates, thus raising prospect of 'friendly fights', something which threatens to negate the advantage which the saffron alliance hoped to reap on account of the fight among rival Maha Vikas Aghadi partners.BJP sources, however, said the party brass would sort out the differences, and pointed out that allies, including NCP of Ajit Pawar, have reached a consensus on the majority of seats. Sources said BJP is likely to contest over 160 seats followed by Sena and NCP.Assembly elections in Maharashtra will take place in a single phase on Nov 20 and counting of votes will take place on November 23.","BJP released its first list of 99 candidates last Sunday.

It's 85-85-85 formula in MVA after Sharad Pawar steps in,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/its-85-85-85-formula-in-mva-after-sharad-pawar-steps-in/articleshow/114519441.cms,"Sharad Pawar (left), and Uddhav Thackeray

Maha formula a setback for Congress, says party neta

MUMBAI: At a point when it appeared Maha Vikas Aghadi could be on the verge of collapse owing to lack of consensus over a seat-sharing formula for assembly polls, MVA's architect & NCP (SP) chief Sharad Pawar stepped in to draft an acceptable agreement.Following a meeting of MPCC president Nana Patole, UBT Shiv Sena's Sanjay Raut, NCP (SP)'s Jayant Patil and CLP leader Balasaheb Thorat with Sharad Pawar, an understanding was reached on Wednesday evening over contesting 255 seats: Congress , NCP (SP) and UBT Sena would fight 85 each, while 18 seats would be left for smaller parties who are allies.There is still no call on 15 disputed seats - 3 in Mumbai & 12 in Vidarbha, but they will be distributed among MVA partners, sources said.UBT Sena’s Sanjay Raut said following Sharad Pawar’s intervention, the process of drafting the seat-sharing formula was expedited as most candidates were in favour of filing nomination papers on Thursday as it is being seen as an auspicious day. Raut initially said at a press meet that consensus had been reached on 270 seats. Later he said, “I had said 270 seats, but it was 255.”A senior Congress politician said the new formula is being seen as a major setback for Congress because on Tuesday, it had been informally agreed that Congress would contest 105 seats, NCP (SP) 84 and UBT Shiv Sena 95. “Since there was no end in sight to the negotiations, Congress decided to go some steps back and agreed on 85 seats. We are sure that we will improve on our Lok Sabha polls performance, and in addition, we expect to secure additional seats from the remaining 15,” the politician said.As it appeared that no agreement could be reached, state Congress functionaries knocked at the doors of AICC president Mallikarjun Kharge, who summoned the Congress state functionaries to New Delhi for discussions.Kharge then deployed Congress legislature party leader Balasaheb Thorat to call on both Sharad Pawar and UBT Sena president Uddhav Thackeray to resolve the dispute. Accordingly, Thorat had a brief meeting with both Pawar and Thackeray, but even then the dispute was not resolved, after which Congress netas felt that it was time to exit from MVA and contest the polls separately.NCP (SP) leadership took note of these developments and felt that if MVA does not contest elections jointly, Mahayuti is sure to retain power in the state. Pawar then spoke to Raut, Thorat and Thackeray and asked them to expedite matters and decide the seat-sharing formula on “as is where is” basis (meaning they should go ahead with what has been decided already) instead of discussing it on a seat-to-seat basis until the final seat is decided. However, notwithstanding Pawar’s words to the warring netas, the row over the 15 disputed seats remains unresolved.","Congress, NCP (SP) and UBT Sena would fight 85 each, while 18 seats would be left for smaller parties who are allies.

HYDERABAD: Andhra Pradesh former CM YS Jagan Mohan Reddy has approached the Hyderabad bench of National Company Law Tribunal ( NCLT ) against his mother YS Vijayamma and sister YS Sharmila , urging it to cancel the July 6, 2024, transfer of shares of Saraswati Power and Industries Private Ltd in favour of his mother.Jagan has fallen out with his mother and sister after Sharmila's political foray in Andhra Pradesh.A bench of judicial member Rajeev Bharadwaj and technical member Sanjay Puri issued notices to Vijayamma, Sharmila, Saraswati Power and also to the Registrar of Companies in Telangana and other respondents, asking them to file their replies to Jagan's petition. The bench adjourned the case to November 8 for further hearing.After his YSR Congress Party swept to power in AP in 2019, Jagan had promised his mother and sister that he would transfer some of the shares in his companies to them. He along with his wife Bharathi then registered a gift deed to this effect.Jagan said the MoU which he entered into with his mother and sister with good intention will not remain in force since they disturbed the goodwill and sought nullification of the share transfer done in favour of his mother. ""To prove that my MoU and gift deeds are real, I transferred all the shares of Sandur Power to Vijayamma in June 2021 as a goodwill gesture,"" he claimed.Later, a gift deed was executed stating that the shares of Saraswati Power too would be transferred after clearance from courts in theED cases , Jagan explained. But with Sharmila making political forays into AP as a rival to him, Jagan said it caused him distress. Stating that there was no goodwill, he conveyed his intent to nullify the MoU and gift deeds.""The transfer of shares in Saraswati Power was done behind my back,"" Jagan said, questioning the decision of the authorities in effecting such transfer without the beneficiaries producing any share certificates of the companies that were facing ED cases. The case, which was listed in NCLT on September 10, was filed under section 59 of Companies Act, which deals with rectification of the register of members.Claiming that his mother and sister had broken this trust by transferring the shares of Saraswati Power in their favour without informing him, Jagan sought directions to the ROC to restore the shareholding pattern to the previous pattern. Jagan maintained that the transfer of shares was not lawfully permissible because the company was facing ED cases and that there was a restraint order from the high court.""Unless all these cases are cleared, no lawful transfer of shares is possible,"" he contended in his petition before NCLT. ""Even the discreet transfer of shares effected by my mother and sister is also illegal,"" the ex-CM said and sought a direction from NCLT to this effect.Jagan further asserted that his late father, former chief minister YS Rajasekhara Reddy, settled all the property issues during his lifetime and the current assets were a result of his hard work and effort. Conveying his changed mind, Jagan said the gift deed that he executed was a mere manifestation of the intent and not the actual transfer of shares.","Andhra Pradesh former CM YS Jagan Mohan Reddy has approached the Hyderabad bench of National Company Law Tribunal ( NCLT ) against his mother YS Vijayamma and sister YS Sharmila.

The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections , which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases. The results will be declared on November 23, along with Maharashtra.In the Tribal-dominated state, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and CM Hemant's Soren Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) are in a direct fight, while the Congress party and Lalu Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) are in alliance with the JMM.The JMM-Congress-RJD alliance are also reportedly seeking to deal with Left parties, Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party and other tribal outfits that have been contesting the elections in the state as independent entities and make efforts to field candidates against the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) on all 81 seats collectively.In the last assembly polls in 2019, the JMM-Congress-RJD alliance won a comfortable majority of 47 seats in a House of 81.The BJP slipped to 25 seats from 37 it held in 2014. The poor performance was perceived to be the outcome of its decision to contest alone backfiring. The party did not foster an alliance with the Ajsu in the 2019 polls when Raghubar Das, currently the Odisha governor, was serving the state as CM.In this year's Lok Sabha polls in Jharkhand, the BJP-led NDA secured nine out of the 14 seats, with the BJP winning eight and its alliance partner, the Ajsu (All Jharkhand Students Union) Party, retaining its single seat.On the other hand, the opposition India bloc improved its tally, increasing its seat count from two in 2019 to five in the parliamentary polls.BJP and JMM have spruced up their pace of campaigning from the ground zero to social media. BJP and JMM leaders are actively rebutting and challenging each other on a range of issues, including illegal immigration, youth welfare, employment and housing.INDIA bloc parties in Jharkhand slammed the EC for holding assembly elections in the state along with that of Maharashtra but claimed that they were ready to slug it out with BJP-led NDA, which has welcomed the announcement of poll dates.JMM, Congress, and CPI (ML-L) said the announcement showed that EC was in a hurry to conduct elections though the assembly tenure was due to end in January next year.Also, both the INDIA bloc and BJP-led NDA are expected to get into huddles to discuss the modalities of seat-sharing which is going to be a challenge for both the competing teams.","The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections, which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra. Elections in Maharashtra will be held in single phase on November 20. The counting of votes will be on November 23.Maharashtra is gearing up for elections as the two major political alliances—the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) and the Mahayuti—prepare to face each other for the first time in a Vidhan Sabha election.The Maha Vikas Aghadi, comprise of the Congress, the Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray), and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) under Sharad Pawar, will go head-to-head with the Mahayuti , which includes the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Shiv Sena faction led by Eknath Shinde, and the NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar. This will be the first electoral contest between these two alliances since the splits within the Shiv Sena and NCP.The MVA is hopeful of replicating its recent Lok Sabha success, while the Mahayuti aims to retain power by leveraging its populist schemes targeted at women and youth. Both alliances have set their sights on winning the state.Narayan Rane, a former Union Minister and the victor in the Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg Lok Sabha constituency, is poised to be a key figure for the BJP in the Konkan region during the forthcoming elections. Meanwhile, two constituencies are expected to be critical battlegrounds: chief minister Eknath Shinde's Kopri-Pachpakdi seat in Thane City and Worli in Mumbai, where Aaditya Thackeray, a leader of the Shiv Sena (UBT), is seeking reelection.In the last Vidhan Sabha elections in 2019, the BJP secured 26.1% of the votes, the Congress 16.1%, the NCP 16.9%, and the Shiv Sena 16.6%. The BJP and the Shiv Sena (then united) formed the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which secured a majority. However, the coalition soon crumbled due to disagreements over government formation, plunging the state into a political crisis.After no party could establish a government, Maharashtra was placed under President's rule. Devendra Fadnavis was briefly sworn in as chief minister, with Ajit Pawar as deputy chief minister. However, both resigned just days later before a scheduled floor test.By November 28, 2019, a new coalition emerged, with the Shiv Sena (Uddhav faction), NCP (Sharad Pawar faction), and Congress forming the Maha Vikas Aghadi government, led by Uddhav Thackeray as chief minister.The state's politics took another turn in June, 2022, when Uddhav Thackeray resigned following a rebellion within the Shiv Sena, led by Eknath Shinde, who then allied with the BJP. Eknath Shinde assumed the role of chief minister, with Devendra Fadnavis returning as deputy chief minister.",The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra. Elections in Maharashtra will be held in single phase on November 20. The counting of votes will be on November 23.
