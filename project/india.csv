It is circulating in the media and on social media, and Kumari Selja has confirmed it. In broad daylight, on a Congress platform in the presence of Deepender Hooda, a female leader was openly harassed and abused by Congress workers who are likely Hooda supporters. If women in Congress are not safe on public platforms during the day, how can the state's women feel secure? Congress is the most anti-women party, and tickets are being sold for money and influence. Sharda Rathore mentioned it, and Simi Rosebell John spoke about the casting couch,"" Poonawalla said.""Many female Congress leaders have left due to the misconduct by so-called Congress men. Yet, Priyanka Vadra, who promotes the slogan of women's empowerment, remains silent. Silent in Kannauj, Kerala, Kolkata, and even in Kathua, where a supporter of the accused was given a ticket and made a star campaigner. It is clear that Congress is anti-women, and their own leaders are revealing this. This is a published report. The discomfort of the female leader is visible in the video when she was being harassed. Congress signifies an anti-women mindset. Congress means if I am a girl, can I be safe from these Congress men? Will Priyanka Vadra and Rahul Gandhi take action against Hooda supporters?"" he added.Meanwhile, Congress leader Kumari Selja condemned the incident and demanded strict action against the accused party workers.""I spoke with her, and she mentioned that she was harassed there quite a bit. People were touching her, elbowing her, trying to remove her from the stage, as we also saw in the video. I confirmed this with her, and she said she was mistreated in such a manner. The point is, if this happens to a woman who works hard to rise in politics or any field and faces such behavior, what could be worse or more condemnable than this?""

Demolish illegal floors of mosque: Shimla MC court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/demolish-illegal-floors-of-mosque-shimla-mc-court/articleshow/113972686.cms,"SHIMLA: The Shimla municipal commissioner's court on Saturday ordered demolition of the top three unauthorised storeys of the disputed Sanjauli mosque that has been at the eye of a storm, with Hindu organisations taking to streets demanding it be razed.The Muslim Welfare Committee was directed to carry out the demolition within two months at its own cost.Municipal commissioner Bhupender Kumar Attri's court, however, disallowed the application moved by Sanjauli residents seeking to be impleaded as a party in the suit, and posted the matter for next hearing to Dec 21 for ascertaining the legal status of the remaining two floors.The case pertaining to the "" illegal construction "" of the mosque has been pending before the Shimla municipal commissioner's court since 2010, with 46 hearings conducted so far.A day after a massive protest was held by Hindu organisations on Sept 11 seeking demolition of the mosque and subsequent police lathicharge, the mosque committee had submitted a memorandum to the municipal commissioner saying they were ready to demolish the illegal portions of the building themselves, if ordered.The Dev Bhoomi Sangharsh Samiti, which has been at the forefront of the agitation seeking demolition of mosque, welcomed the court order, although its convenor Bharat Bhushan claimed entire building was illegal and should be razed. Himachal wakf board's counsel B S Thakur said they were awaiting detailed order. Rural development minister Anirudh Singh had earlier pointed out that in the revenue records pertaining to 1945-46, the land on which the mosque was built was in the name of Rana Sahib Bahadur Koti. Thereafter, the land ownership was with state govt and its possession was shown in the name of ""Ahl-e-Islam"" (Islam religion followers).","The Muslim Welfare Committee was directed to carry out the demolition within two months at its own cost.

Farooq Abdullah rules out post-poll alliance with BJP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/farooq-abdullah-rules-out-post-poll-alliance-with-bjp/articleshow/113972003.cms,"SRINAGAR: National Conference (NC) president Farooq Abdullah ruled out Saturday any possibility of a post-poll alliance with BJP to form the next govt in J&K after results of the assembly elections are declared on Oct 8.Abdullah stressed that any party that aligns with BJP would “vanish” in J&K. “The vote we got here is the vote against BJP,” said the former J&K CM, whose party contested the three-phase elections (Sept 18 to Oct 1) in alliance with Congress.“The difficulties they (BJP) put the Muslims in, bulldozed their shops, houses, mosques, and schools — do you think we will go with them?” PTI quoted him as saying.“I think our people will not vote for BJP. If they (BJP) think they will form the govt, then they live in cuckoo’s world.”NC vice president and Farooq’s son Omar Abdullah echoed his father’s sentiments, saying the party would prefer to sit in opposition rather than forge an alliance with BJP. “Any kind of arrangement would ruin any party in Kashmir,” he said.The statements came in response to speculation of potential post-election alliances, particularly if neither NC nor BJP secures the required number of seats for govt formation.The elections were the first in J&K since the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019 and the region’s bifurcation into two Union territories, including Ladakh. J&K now has a 95-member assembly — 90 elected and five nominated by the lieutenant governor.PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti ’s younger daughter Iltija Mufti accused BJP-led Centre for changing rules in J&K, alleging Saturday that these moves were meant to reduce the CM’s role to that of a “glorified mayor” and leave the govt powerless.“With the LG nominating five MLAs and the chief secretary changing transaction of business rules, it’s clear that the incoming govt will be a toothless tiger… How much more will the Government of India strip J&K of any semblance of authority and autonomy? Rubber stamp CM…” Iltija wrote on X.Iltija’s remarks followed Omar’s suggestion that BJP had “accepted defeat” in J&K. “Why else would the chief secretary be assigned the duty to change (assembly’s) transaction of business rules…?” Omar asked Friday.","National Conference (NC) president Farooq Abdullah ruled out any possibility of a post-poll alliance with BJP to form the next govt in J&K.
