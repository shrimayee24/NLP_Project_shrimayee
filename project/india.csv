'I made a mistake ... ': Ajit Pawar repents 'Pawar vs Pawar' contest in Baramati,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/i-made-a-mistake-ajit-pawar-repents-pawar-vs-pawar-contest-in-baramati/articleshow/112497556.cms,"File photo of Ajit Pawar with wife Sunetra (Middle) and cousin Supriya Sule

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra deputy chief minister and NCP chief Ajit Pawar on Tuesday regretted the ""Pawar versus Pawar"" electoral battle in Baramati in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. Baramati Lok Sabha seat, which has been a bastion of Sharad Pawar for decades, saw an interesting contest between senior Pawar's daughter Supriya Sule and his estranged nephew's wife Sunetra Pawar .For Sharad Pawar, who had lost his party and most of his MLAs to Ajit Pawar, it was not just a prestige battle but also a test of his influence and relevance in state politics.Sharad Pawar won this battle hands down with Supriya Sule securing 51.85% of votes and Sunetra Pawar managing only 40.64%. In fact, Sharad Pawar trumped his estranged nephew comprehensively winning 8 Lok Sabha seats, his best-ever performance in Maharashtra. Ajit Pawar, on the other hand, could manage only one seat despite being a part of the BJP-led ruling alliance in the state.Reflecting on the Lok Sabha battle, Ajit Pawar said one should not allow politics to enter home. ""I love all my sisters. One shouldn't allow politics to enter homes. I made a mistake in fielding Sunetra against my sister. This shouldn't have happened. But the parliamentary board (of NCP) made a decision. Now I feel it was wrong,"" Ajit Pawar told Marathi news channel Jai Maharashtra.Ajit Pawar, who had split the NCP in July last year and eventually got the name and symbol of the party, has been pushed to a corner after a disastrous showing in Lok Sabha elections. The NCP still does not have a minister in Modi 3.0. This after the party refused to accept minister of state with independent charge post that was being offered for its leader Praful Patel. Ajit Pawar had then said it was a conscious decision taken unanimously as Praful Patel had been a Cabinet minister at the Centre earlier and the offered post would be demotion for him.What's worse for the junior Pawar, the RSS had openly questioned the BJP's alliance with him after the Lok Sabha results were out.An article in ""Organiser"" magazine, which is linked to the RSS, had slammed BJP's move and called it ""unnecessary politicking."" It had said the induction of Ajit Pawar's NCP into NDA had reduced the brand value of BJP.""Maharashtra is a prime example of unnecessary politicking and avoidable manipulations. NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar joined BJP though BJP and split SS (Shiv Sena) had a comfortable majority. Sharad Pawar would have faded away in two-three years as NCP would have lost energy with infighting between cousins,"" RSS lifelong member Ratan Sharda had said in the article.""Why was this ill-advised step taken? BJP supporters were hurt because they had fought against this Congress ideology for years and were persecuted. In a single stroke, BJP reduced its brand value. After years of struggle to become numero uno in Maharashtra, it became just another political party without any difference,"" he had added.However, despite RSS criticism, Ajit Pawar remains a part of the ruling coalition for now. But as Maharashtra gears up for the year-end assembly elections, the NCP leader stares at an uncertain future. Little wonder, the junior Pawar, who was very aggressive vis-à-vis Sharad Pawar before the Lok Sabha elections, seems to have softened his stance. However, Sharad Pawar has made it clear that he can accept Ajit Pawar back only after consulting all leaders who stood with him after his nephew's rebellion.","Sharad Pawar trumped his estranged nephew comprehensively winning 8 Lok Sabha seats. Ajit Pawar, on the other hand, could manage only one seat despite being a part of the BJP-led ruling alliance in the state.

HC overturns man’s conviction for rape of daughter after 9 years in jail,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hc-overturns-mans-conviction-for-rape-of-daughter-after-9-years-in-jail/articleshow/112502639.cms,"PILIBHIT: Babu Ram , a resident of Turkpur Barhwar village under the jurisdiction of Neuria police station, was released from Pilibhit district jail on Monday after the Allahabad high court overturned his conviction for repeatedly raping his minor daughter.

Ram had been in jail since his arrest, as he was never granted bail.Jitendra Pal Singh , Ram's lawyer, said, “The medical examination of the victim, who is around 14 to 15 years old, showed no signs of external or internal injuries and no spermatozoa were found in the pathological examination of her vaginal slides. Despite these findings, the trial court focused on the victim's statement recorded under CrPC section 164, in which she accused her father of repeatedly raping her.”“The high court, however, considered the supplementary medical reports and the testimony of Dr Anjali Singh, who conducted the victim's examination. She testified that in cases of sexual assault, some signs should be evident on the victim's body, which was not the case here. The court also noted the improbability of the victim being raped repeatedly over a year without anyone noticing, especially as she lived with her grandparents near the house of the accused,” he added.","Allahabad high court overturns Babu Ram's conviction for repeatedly raping his minor daughter.
