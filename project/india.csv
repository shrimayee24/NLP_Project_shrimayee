NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu BJP chief K Annamalai fired back at chief minister MK Stalin after the chief minister announced that the state was ready for ""another language war"". Stalin called an all-party meeting on March 5 to discuss the Lok Sabha delimitation issue -- the ""threat"" that Tamil Nau was going to lose eight seats because the state successfully implemented the family planning programme leading to population control.Annamalai said the BJP may not attend the all-party meeting as he believes Stalin was now trying to ""shift the narrative"" with the ""imaginary fear"" regarding delimitation. ""When TN CM Thiru MK Stalin knows the whole of TN has rejected their argument except a few paint-dabba carrying DMK cadres on the third language for our children studying in TN Govt schools similar to the schools run by TN CM’s family, he now wants to shift the narrative to his imaginary fear of TN losing in the Delimitation of seats,"" Annamalai posted on X.""What a shame & downfall for DMK!"" he said.""When our Hon PM Thiru @narendramodi avl had clearly said delimitation - if and when it happens - will be favourable to all, including the southern states, why this fear-mongering Thiru @mkstalin?

Annamalai wrote.When Stalin was asked if the March 5 meeting would discuss the three-language policy in light of the National Education Policy, Stalin said that to raise a voice in Parliament on these issues, adequate number of MPs was required. ""Because, in the name of delimitation, a sword is hanging over southern states,"" he said.""Tamil Nadu succeeded in population control through the family planning programme. Just because population is less, there is a situation of the Lok Sabha seats being cut down (in TN). We stand to lose 8 seats and as a result, we would be having only 31 MPs, and not the 39 (present number),"" he added.""Our representation (in Parliament) will reduce, Tamil Nadu's voice is being stifled. This is a matter of Tamil Nadu's rights. All leaders and political parties should jointly speak across party lines on the issue,"" the CM added.DMK has been opposing the three-language policy and insisted that the state would continue with Tamil and English resisting the push for Hindi from the BJP-led NDA government.On the issue question of Hindi imposition, Stalin said Tamil Nadu is ready for another language war if necessary -- in reference to the anti-Hindi agitation of 1965.",Tamil Nadu BJP chief K Annamalai fired back at chief minister MK Stalin.

Medical examination confirms groom was drunk; booked under Dowry Act

BAREILLY: A drunk groom 's misstep at his own wedding in UP - in which he mistakenly garlanded his bride's best friend - set off a series of mishaps, ending with his arrest and the bride calling off the marriage.It started as Indian weddings often do - with a delay. The groom, Ravindra Kumar, 26, was late, and when he arrived, he didn't seem to be in a hurry, lingering with his friends, catching up over drinks.The 500-odd guests at a house in Naughwa Bhagwantpur village in Bareilly stayed in their seats as the bride waited. The garland-exchanging ceremony - one of those formalities that takes only a moment - was about to begin. Then, Kumar turned to the wrong woman. It was just a second. A miscalculation. But in that brief pause, before anyone could intervene, he placed the ceremonial garland over the bride's best friend.As confusion rippled through the crowd, he took the garland off and placed it around the neck of a male friend beside her. Then, to perhaps maintain a certain symmetry, he garlanded an elderly guest as well. There are moments when silence is more telling than noise. The wedding guests did not react immediately. They watched. The bride, Radha Devi, 21, did not. She slapped him and walked away. It had taken months of preparation.Omkar Verma, the bride's brother, said the family had spent over Rs 10 lakh on the wedding. He had his own theory for why things had gone wrong. ""They were unhappy with the dowry gifts. Maybe this was their way of humiliating us,"" he told TOI. ""And then we find out that he isn't even a farmer as his family told us-he's a truck driver.""At 4am, a complaint was filed at Kularia police station. By morning, the wedding was off, and Kumar was in police custody. By noon, he had apologised. His family suggested the wedding should go on. Radha refused.Circle officer Harsh Modi-used to break-ins and thefts but less accustomed to cases of misdirected garlanding-kept his summary brief. ""The groom was intoxicated. He misbehaved. His medical examination confirmed he was drunk. He was booked under sections of the Dowry Act.""","Medical examination confirms groom was drunk; booked under Dowry Act.

No – Some Crimes Require Stricter Punishment Yes – If They've Served Their Time, They Deserve a Chance

SC: 20-year jail terms would become meaningless if state takes such stand

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Monday took exception to Delhi govt's stand that a convict, sentenced to life imprisonment with 20 years of jail term without remission , could not be released even after completion of the period.A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan expressed surprise over the oral submission made by the Delhi govt counsel in the case of convict Sukhdev Yadav alisa Pehalwan in the Nitish Katara murder case and asked that it be said on oath in an affidavit. It said the govt's stand might amount to contempt of the court's order which awarded a 20-year jail term.How can a govt take such a stand? Twenty-year jail terms would become meaningless. The court had said 20-year imprisonment and now the state is saying he cannot be released even after 20 years,"" the bench said.The court was hearing a plea by Sukhdev Yadav alias Pehalwan who was sentenced to life imprisonment with a caveat that it shall be 20 years of actual imprisonment without consideration of remission. He was convicted in the 2002 Nitish Katara murder case and had filed a petition seeking furlough. As his jail term is about to get over in a few weeks, the court sought the state's response on when he could be released from jail.Senior advocate Aparajita Singh, appearing for Nitish's mother Neelam Katara, said it was a life sentence with 20 years without remission which meant that the convict could be eligible for remission after 20 years.The bench, however, was not convinced and disapproved of the state govt's stand on the issue relating to freedom. ""This is the concept of liberty for the state? We will deal with it. Let your home secretary take a stand on oath after taking legal opinion. If needed we can haul up your home secretary,"" the bench said.On Oct 3, 2016, Supreme Court had awarded 25-year jail term without any benefit of remission to Vikas Yadav and his cousin Vishal for their role in the kidnapping and killing of Nitish Katara. Co-convict Sukhdev Yadav was handed down a 20-year jail term in the case.Earlier, Delhi high court, while upholding the life imprisonment awarded to Vikas and Vishal Yadav by the trial court, had specified a 30-year sentence, without any remission, to the two. It had awarded 25-year jail term to Sukhdev Yadav.All three were convicted and sentenced for kidnapping Nitish from a marriage party on the night of Feb 16, 2002, and killing him for his alleged affair with Bharti Yadav, Vikas's sister. Bharti is the daughter of Uttar Pradesh politician D P Yadav who is in jail in connection with another murder case.","Supreme Court takes exception to Delhi govt's stand that a convict, sentenced to life imprisonment with 20 years of jail term without remission, could not be released even after completion of the period.

Vij women cops to probe

VIJAYAWADA: A shocking case of deceit and exploitation came to light in Vijayawada, exposing the horrifying ordeal of a young girl, who was lured and abandoned after she gave birth to two children. The case, which originated in Rompicherla of Palnadu district, has now reached the Vijayawada Child Welfare Committee (CWC).According to Chandragiri Radha Kumari, CWC member, Batula Nagaraju (31), a resident of Rompicherla, was already married and had two children when he set his sights on a 13-year-old girl in 2017. Using threats and deceitful promises, he manipulated the minor and eventually fathered two children with her. However, as the financial burden grew, Nagaraju allegedly sold the children under the guise of adoption. He sold one of the babies to a woman in Vuyyuru and another to a couple in Narasaraopet.Meanwhile, the girl's mother, unaware of the full extent of the situation, filed a missing complaint at Rompicherla police station. Upon investigation, police traced Nagaraju to Nandivelu, where he was working as a labourer for a railway contractor.To evade legal action, Nagaraju declared that he married the girl, but she later discovered that he was already married with children. When the truth surfaced, the village elders intervened, and Nagaraju distanced himself from her.Instead of taking responsibility, Nagaraju allegedly launched a campaign of harassment against the girl's family. He reportedly wrote her phone number on train coaches with misleading messages, attempting to tarnish her reputation.Additionally, he filed false complaints with the child welfare department in Palnadu, alleging that the girl's family sold his children. However, upon investigation, it was found that Nagaraju fabricated these claims to mislead authorities.On Sunday, a case was registered against Nagaraju in Vijayawada. On Monday, the survivor approached the CWC members in Vijayawada, pleading for strict action against Nagaraju for the physical and mental trauma he inflicted upon her.The case has now been handed over to Vijayawada's women police station for further investigation. The survivor's family met NTR district police commissioner SV Rajasekhara Babu on Monday night, urging action against Nagaraju. Following the complaint, CWC members instructed Nagaraju to appear along with the two children on Friday.","Batula Nagaraju, 31, lured and exploited a 13-year-old girl in Vijayawada, fathering two children with her.
