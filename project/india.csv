What the EC said





NEW DELHI: Congress leader and leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi has widened his charge of “vote theft”, alleging that the Haryana assembly polls were not an isolated case. Addressing reporters in Panarpani, Madhya Pradesh on Sunday, he claimed that the BJP used the same method in earlier elections as well, including in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra.“After seeing the data that I also presented in a press conference about how vote theft took place in Haryana, I think the BJP has done the same thing in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra. We have all the evidence and will release it one by one – what we have shown so far is only a little,” he said.Rahul said there was an effort to institutionalise “vote chori”, adding, “There is an attack on democracy and the Constitution of B. R. Ambedkar. PM Modi, Amit Shah, and CEC Gyanesh Kumar are directly involved in it.” He claimed the Congress will release further evidence in phases and asked the youth to “resist this wholesale theft of democracy”.On 5 November, Rahul Gandhi held a press conference where he presented what he called “The H-files”, accusing the BJP of “stealing” the 2024 Haryana assembly election. He cited electoral roll data to claim that 25 lakh entries were fake and the Election Commission had “colluded” with the BJP to ensure its victory.He alleged a “centralised plan” and pointed to a ‘Brazilian model’ whose photograph was used 22 times in 10 booths under names such as “Seema, Sweety and Saraswati”.The congress leader said, “One in eight voters in Haryana are fake and despite that the Congress loses by 22,779 votes which was the difference in eight seats.” Claiming 1,24,177 fake pictures were used, he argued, “You can understand that there was no election in Haryana. There was a theft (of elections) in Haryana and it is very clear who is responsible for the theft.”According to him, “Sarkar Chori” had destroyed democracy and the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) was the latest weapon. Rahul alleged that the Election Commission and the BJP ran “Operation Sarkar Chori” to convert a Congress victory into a loss. “Why is the Election Commission not removing duplicates? It is because if it does so, it would result in fair elections and it doesn’t want fair elections,” he said. He also accused the CEC of lying when he said “house number zero” was used for people without formal addresses.He told reporters: “Every single opposition party understands this, they can see this...If the voter list is a lie, there is no democracy. My role as an opposition leader is to let you know the real world that you are living in.” Asked about approaching the courts, Rahul Gandhi responded, “The Supreme Court, the highest court in the country, is watching… it is not hidden.”The BJP dismissed Rahul's claims as “false and baseless”, accusing him of defaming India’s institutions to divert attention from political setbacks. Union minister Kiren Rijiju said he was “raising questions on the Election Commission to hide his failures and defame the country’s democracy.” He accused Gandhi of trying to “instigate the GenZ”, insisting such efforts would not succeed. “The young generation is firmly standing by Modiji,” he said.Rijiju also questioned why the Lok Sabha LoP had not filed complaints before the Election Commission or courts, arguing, “But they do not have to file any appeal before the EC or approach the court. He (Gandhi) will just call a press conference, give a presentation made by someone else and run away,"" he said and asked, ""Will democracy function in such a manner?""Defence minister Rajnath Singh too criticised Rahul Gandhi during a rally in Bihar, saying, “If Rahul Gandhi thinks that the votes of the people of Bihar are being stolen, why does he not file a written complaint with the Election Commission?” Singh accused Gandhi of misleading voters and claimed the Congress was resorting to “lies” for political success.Election Commission (EC) officials told news agency PTI that Rahul Gandhi’s allegations of voter manipulation were “unfounded.” They said no appeals were filed against the electoral rolls and no instances of multiple voting were reported. Responding to Gandhi’s claim that 25 lakh entries were “fake” and that the polls were “stolen,” officials questioned why Congress booth-level agents failed to raise objections during the revision process.(With inputs from agencies)","Congress leader and leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi has widened his charge of “vote theft”, alleging that the Haryana assembly polls were not an isolated case.

NEW DELHI: Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi on Friday launched a sharp attack at the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Election Commission, alleging large-scale electoral malpractice and claiming that Prime Minister Narendra Modi “became the PM through chunav chori. ”Speaking to reporters in Delhi, Rahul said his party had gathered extensive evidence to expose what he described as a pattern of election manipulation. “We have a lot of material, we will continue this process. We will clearly show India's GenZ and youth that Narendra Modi became the PM through 'chunav chori' and BJP indulges in 'chunav chori',” he said.Referring to recent reports of a BJP leader allegedly casting votes at two different locations, Rahul claimed that electoral fraud was not isolated but systematic. “I gave a presentation that Haryana elections were not elections at all. A 'wholesale chori' occurred there. There was no response by the EC to the allegations levelled by me – fake vote, fake photograph,” he said.According to Rahul, the BJP’s defence of the incident without denial only reinforced his charge. “BJP is defending this but not negating what I said. Media is picking up small examples, like a Brazilian woman voted.How was voting done on the photo of a Brazilian national?” he asked.The Congress leader went on to accuse the Prime Minister, home minister Amit Shah, and the Election Commission of jointly undermining the Constitution. “The reality is that Narendra Modi ji, Amit Shah ji and EC are attacking the Constitution together. Constitution says 'One man, one vote'. Haryana shows that there was no 'One man, one vote' there. It was 'One man, multiple votes',” he said.He alleged that the same pattern of electoral malpractice was being repeated across states. “They are going to do the same in Bihar. It happened in MP, Chhattisgarh, Haryana and Gujarat,” he said, adding that his party would continue to raise the issue to “protect the Constitution and the people’s vote.”The Election Commission has not yet responded to Rahul Gandhi’s latest allegations. The BJP, meanwhile, has dismissed earlier claims by the Congress leader as politically motivated attempts to discredit the electoral process.","Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi alleges large-scale electoral malpractice.

BENGALURU: Karnataka Congress Saturday announced it has collected 1.1 crore signatures from across the state as part of AICC's nationwide campaign against what it claims as voter fraud.CM Siddaramaiah and his deputy D K Shivakumar , setting aside differences over leadership issues, made a rare joint appearance here to unveil the results of the signature campaign and presented a set of documents alleging discrepancies in voting, which TOI could not independently verify.The duo accused the Election Commission (EC) of failing to curb large-scale irregularities in electoral rolls. Holding the EC responsible for ignoring anomalies nationwide, Shivakumar charged: ""In Haryana, Rahul Gandhi exposed 25 lakh fake votes, but the Commission did nothing. It has become an agent of BJP.""Siddaramaiah said the documents and signatures would be submitted to the EC and President Droupadi Murmu, asserting that the campaign was aimed at ""protecting democracy and the Constitution"".He charged BJP with manipulating voter lists in several constituencies of the state.“Ever since BJP came to power at the Centre, constitutional institutions, including the EC and CBI, have lost their independence.BJP is unparalleled when it comes to lying and voter fraud. We will not tolerate this,” he added.Reacting to the media address by the CM and DCM, former minister and BJP MLA S Suresh Kumar said: “With Congress facing a likely defeat in Bihar assembly elections, the two leaders appear to be seeking an excuse by making baseless allegations of voter fraud.”Shivakumar alleged large-scale electoral irregularities in assembly constituencies such as Mahadevapura and Aland. “In Mahadevapura, some houses had more than 80 registered voters, and even bars had 70-80 names on the voter list,” he said.Drawing attention to the probe being conducted by a special investigation team (SIT) into alleged irregularities in Aland, where minister Priyank Kharge had raised a red flag before the polls, the deputy CM said: “Fake deletion requests were filed at 4am, leading to 14 deletions within 17 minutes and nearly 6,000 names were deleted. Outsiders used mobile numbers from other states to manipulate records. Around Rs 80 was paid per deleted vote, and BJP candidate Subhash Guthedar was accused of burning voter lists. ”",Karnataka Congress Saturday announced it has collected 1.1 crore signatures from across the state as part of AICC's nationwide campaign against what it claims as voter fraud.
