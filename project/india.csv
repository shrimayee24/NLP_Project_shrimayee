"To embarrass govt, Cong demands Dhankhar farewell",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/to-embarrass-govt-cong-demands-dhankhar-farewell/articleshow/122870068.cms,"Jairam Ramesh. (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Congress on Wednesday directly asked BJP and the Modi govt to hold a farewell for Jagdeep Dhankhar, in a move that appeared to be the opposition party's bid to embarrass the governing camp which has given a curt parting to the VP after a sudden breakup in relationship.In a closed-door meeting of the business advisory committee of RS, senior Congress neta Jairam Ramesh conveyed to BJP stalwarts, which included key ministers and leader of the House J P Nadda, that Dhankhar should be given a send-off befitting of the high constitutional position he occupied. The context of his demand was the scheduled farewell on Thursday for RS MPs whose term is ending soon.Ramesh told TOI, ""There is going to be a farewell to the retiring members tomorrow in RS. So, I suggested why not have a farewell for the retired chairman also."" According to him, BJP netas kept mum.The appeal for farewell appeared more of a taunt as BJP and Dhankhar have had a bitter falling out amid indications that the VP resigned after earning the displeasure of the Modi govt for seeking to supersede the removal notice that the govt sponsored in Lok Sabha against Justice Yashwant Varma by entertaining a parallel one by the opposition in RS.His suggestion to suddenly move on the removal notice pending against Justice Shekhar Yadav of Allahabad HC for ""hate speech"" also did not go down well with the BJP brass. Post-resignation, there has been no praise or polite words that are customary for the high officials who leave their positions.Ramesh said, ""A farewell is the minimum courtesy we owe to the chairman who was also the Vice President of India. It is especially so for the govt which appointed him.""Meanwhile, CPM MP John Brittas demanded that the govt clarify the circumstances surrounding Dhankhar's resignation to ""protect the dignity of the second-highest constitutional office and address growing speculation"". In a post on X, he also said it would be befitting for Dhankhar to ""break his silence to uphold the dignity of the office"" if the govt ""continues to evade questions"".",Congress asks BJP and Modi govt to hold a farewell for Jagdeep Dhankhar.

CJI recuses from hearing Justice Varma's plea,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cji-recuses-from-hearing-justice-varmas-plea/articleshow/122868854.cms,"CJI BR Gavai (File photo)

Sibal seeks urgent hearing before LS admits Varma removal motion

NEW DELHI: Chief Justice B R Gavai on Wednesday recused from hearing a petition by Allahabad high court's Justice Yashwant Varma, who has sought quashing of an in-house inquiry panel report finding him complicit in the sacks of cash discovered at his official residence on the night of March 14 when he was a judge of Delhi HC.""It would not be proper for me (a bench headed by him) to take up the matter as I was part of the administrative processes related to the judge (linked to the cash-in-kothi incident). I will list it for hearing as soon as possible,"" CJI Gavai said. The other members of the bench were Justices K Vinod Chandran and Joymalya Bagchi.Justice Yashwant Varma's counsel Kapil Sibal, who in his YouTube show has already doubted the procedure adopted by the inquiry panel and questioned then CJI Sanjiv Khanna's decision to send the report to the govt along with the recommendation to initiate a removal motion, sought urgent hearing before a bench headed by CJI Gavai a day after the govt garnered signatures of more than 150 Lok Sabha MPs for the removal motion.Probably understanding the need for an expeditious hearing prior to the Lok Sabha speaker admitting the removal motion, Sibal said, ""There is some urgency. Please list the HC judge's petition for hearing. The recommendation for his removal raises some important constitutional issues.""In his social media panel discussion, which included former SC judge Sanjay Kishan Kaul and ex-Delhi HC judge Mukta Gupta, Sibal had said sending the in-house panel report to the govt amounted to mixing politics with a purely constitutional process.Justice Yashwant Varma's writ petition, filed through advocate Vaibhav Niti, has questioned why Delhi Police and Delhi Fire Service personnel, who discovered the cash, did not seize it or prepare a 'panchnama' (statement of witnesses in writing corroborating the discovery of cash), which alone could have been admissible evidence.Accusing former CJI Khanna of subjecting him to media trial by uploading ""unsubstantiated"" material against him on the SC's official website, Justice Varma has said principles of natural justice were violated as the then CJI did not grant him a personal hearing after offering him the choice of either resigning or taking voluntary retirement in the wake of the damning report.The May 3 report of the inquiry committee was sent to the President and the PM on May 8 with the recommendation to initiate removal motion.",Chief Justice B R Gavai recused from hearing a petition by Allahabad high court's Justice Yashwant Varma.

DHANBAD/RANCHI: At least 12 miners are feared trapped in a caved-in illegal coal mine in Jamunia under Baghmara block, around 40 km from Dhanbad district headquarters, with some feared dead, local villagers and political leaders said on Wednesday.The police, administration and the Bharat Coking Coal Limited (BCCL), however, said that, so far, they have not found any sign of mine collapse.The alleged incident, however, snowballed into a political brick-batting on Wednesday as both the ruling and coalition parties accused each other over the illegal mining menace in coal belt and the state at large.""Twelve labourers were trapped while some others, who managed to escape, were undergoing treatment in private hospitals. Families of the trapped workers were being offered Rs 10 lakh as compensation. This is a planned racket where labourers are brought from other districts and used for illegal mining. After the mishap, the entry point was filled with mud to conceal the incident,"" Giridih MP Chandra Prakash Chaudhary claimed.On the other hand, Jamshedpur west MLA Saryu Roy on Tuesday wrote on X, ""At a place called Jamunia in Baghmara, Dhanbad, a tunnel used for illegal mining collapsed, resulting in the death of nine workers.The illegal mining mafia is engaged in disposing of the bodies of the deceased. I have informed #SSP#Dhanbad about this,"" he wrote on X.

So far, no formal complaint has been lodged from any side,"" he told TOI.Regional nodal security officer of block- 2 project of BCCL, Rajiv Ranjan, also said there is no information of any such incident in the closed underground mine of block-2 project.Health, food and civil supplies and disaster management department minister and Congress MLA, Irfan Ansari accused the BCCL for patronising illegal mining demanding appropriate compensation.He said, ""BCCL needs to be controlled first. They are patronising illegal mining with local mafia by engaging our innocent, poor workers. In case of mishap, they will be called as illegal miners to avoid giving compensation. I urge CM to announce appropriate compensation and take strict action. I will soon take up this matter with him.""State Congress hit out at the Centre as BCCL comes under it. ""The security of the mines is entirely managed by institutions like CCL and BCCL through CISF which is directly under the Centre and the state govt has no control. Coal companies, for their benefit, leave mines insecurely open after mining instead of closing them permanently, promoting illegal mining. This is a centrally orchestrated murder,"" said spokesperson Sonal Shanti.BJP hit back demanding a CBI probe. ""It's a state sponsored deaths and CBI probe should be instituted for such illegal mining and its related deaths.
