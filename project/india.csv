"In Biju’s karmabhoomi, BJP fields heavyweight eyeing maiden win",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-bijus-karmabhoomi-bjp-fields-heavyweight-eyeing-maiden-win/articleshow/110608884.cms,"NEW DELHI: Kendrapara Lok Sabha constituency, the karmabhoomi of former chief minister Biju Patnaik in the coastal belt of Odisha , has gained national attention with BJP turning to its national vice-president Baijayant ‘Jay’ Panda in search of a maiden victory.BJP heavyweights PM Narendra Modi, UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath, his Assam counterpart Himanta Biswa Sarma, and Union minister Smriti Irani all campaigned for Panda, who is in charge of the party’s UP, Assam, and Delhi units.Two-time chief minister Biju, father of current CM Naveen Patnaik , had won Kendrapara in 1977 with Bharatiya Lok Dal, and again in 1980 and 1984 with Janata Party.BJP has its task cut out in the constituency as it has never won the seat, which continues to be a BJD stronghold. The party, which was founded in Dec 1997, a few months after Biju’s death, has been winning the seat since the 1999 Lok Sabha elections . Besides, BJD won all seven assembly segments in Kendrapra LS con stituency — Salipur, Mahanga, Patkura, Kendrapara, Aul, Rajanagar and Mahakalapada — in the 2019 state elections.Panda, who was with BJD, won the general elections from Kendrapara twice — in 2009 and 2014. Following his suspension in Jan 2018 for alleged anti-party activities, Panda joined BJP and lost the Kendrapara seat to BJD’s actor-turnedpolitician Anubhav Mohanty in 2019. Mohanty, who too is now with BJP, had defeated Panda by more than 1.8 lakh votes.BJD has fielded Congress turncoat Anshuman Mohanty this time. Ex-Congress MLA Mohanty’s nomination was significant as he is the son of late Nalinikanta Mohanty, who was a protégé of Biju. Nalinikanta had won from Rajnagar assembly segment in Kendrapara seven times from 1977 to 2004, including on Janata Party, Janata Dal, BJD and Congress tickets.Though BJD still claims to have a vice-like grip on its traditional fort of Kendrapara, BJP sees an undercurrent in favour of Modi this time, not just in the constituency but across the state.“Baijayant Panda is very hardworking. I appeal all of you to vote for him so that he wins with a record margin,” Modi said in his address in Kendrapara on Wednesday.Panda said people across Odisha, including Kendrapara, have decided to usher in a change this time under the leadership of Modi.“Odisha has been deprived of development as the BJD govt hijacked central schemes. Odia Asmita (pride) is now in danger as a Tamil (indirectly hinting at BJD strategist V K Pandian) has captured Naveen babu,” said Panda, who fell out of Naveen’s favour in 2018 after indirectly accusing Pandian, who was then Naveen’s private secretary in the CM’s office, of indulging in political activity and controlling the party affairs.At a recent election rally in Kendrapara, Naveen and Pandian came down heavily on Panda. Without naming him, Naveen said the former ‘betrayed’ the people of Kendrapara.“I had made someone the MP from Kendrapara for 10 years. However, he worked only for his own prosperity and the profit of his company without doing anything for people. He betrayed the people of Kendrapara,” Naveen said, a charge denied by Panda.Amid BJP’s allegations that Kendrapara continues to reel under issues involving distress sale of paddy, defunct river embankments, unavailability of cold storage, bad roads, and rampant irregularities in rural development works, BJD claims Kendrapara underwent transformation.The party also harps on the proposed establishment of a steel plant by Japanbased Nippon Steel along with ArcelorMittal in Kendrapara. Naveen said AM/ NS India, the joint venture, has already announced Rs 1 lakh crore investment to establish a 24 million tonne per annum state-of-the-art steel plant with sustainable technologies in Kendrapara.“People of Kendrapara are with Naveen babu’s development agenda. BJD will continue to retain the seat, thanks to the blessings of people,” BJD candidate Mohanty said.Despite all odds, Congress candidate Sidharth Swarup Dash is hopeful of giving a checkmate. “I may not match the money power of BJD and BJP. But I am confident that the people of Kendrapara will give their mandate to Congress,” Dash said.","Kendrapara Lok Sabha constituency is the karmabhoomi of former chief minister Biju Patnaik. BJP has never won the seat, which continues to be a BJD stronghold. BJD has fielded Congress turncoat Anshuman Mohanty this time.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110608937,imgsize-33076,width-400,resizemode-4/110608937.jpg"
"How parties are juggling caste, class & community",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-parties-are-juggling-caste-class-community/articleshow/110608888.cms,"BJP’s Dalit Challenge

‘Sikh Vs Dalit’

Ten years ago, when Aam Aadmi Party first tested the ground in Punjab, the soil was fertile for a newbie that would upset the bipolar contests between Shiromani Akali Dal-BJP and Congress.The Punjabi diaspora, largely Sikhs, had earlier displayed its yearning for change through Manpreet Badal-led PPP. But it ended in failure. After the 2012 polls, restlessness on Sikh issues was palpable — first on Balwant Singh Rajoana’s scheduled hanging and then on Bandi Singhs (Sikh prisoners). Amidst this, AAP projected prominent faces identifying with Sikh issues pertaining to 1984 and drew support from all sections, across communities and castes. The biggest push came from diaspora and despite its skeletal organisation, AAP won four seats with onefourth of vote share.After 2014, Punjab’s political landscape was three-cornered till farm movement forced a breakup between Akalis and BJP in 2020. In 2021, AAP used Bargari sacrilege and Behbal Kalan issues to its advantage and in 2022 assembly polls capitalised on sentiment of change among people through its “guarantees” — from 300 units of free power to monthly Rs 1,000 to every woman. AAP gained support across castes, communities and classes and every fault-line was transcended as big guns of other parties were decimated. AAP romped home with 92 of 117 seats.Now that BJP with massive resources has jumped into the fray solo in Punjab’s political landscape, here is an attempt to decipher how caste and community cards can work in this election and afterwards:The caste gambit played by Punjab’s then ruling Congress party in the 2022 assembly elections failed when despite appointing Charanjit Singh Channi as the chief minister and later making him the CM face, it failed to consolidate Dalit votes. Congress could win only five of 34 reserved seats and Channi lost both seats he contested as Dalits too responded to the AAP’s call of ‘badlav’ (change).What worked for AAP was the strong desire of people for a qualitative shift inPunjab politics , which was fanned by the farm movement, and its two “guarantees”.Just as caste failed in the 2022 polls, class seems to be a bigger factor in these Lok Sabha polls. Even now, 300 units of free power is the single biggest issue favouring AAP, considerably blunting caste, and community factors. It has helped the party create a constituency for itself based on class.BJP expects consolidation of Hindu voters in Punjab as it is contesting on its own after more than two decades. Other parties are wary as Hindus account for 38.5% of the population and Sikh voters appear to be in a disarray. However, there are layers and blocs within Punjabi Hindus and ‘Hindu consolidation’ has essentially meant upper caste Hindus.Despite BJP’s success in winning over backward classes and Dalits in other states, Punjabi Dalits, who make around one-third of the state’s population, have so far remained a challenge for the saffron party. Caste contradictions exist but they are not as deep and wide as in other northern states. At times, religious identity across castes also decides political behaviour. This is true for Sikhs across castes as well as for upper-caste Hindus, whose caste becomes secondary when they vote as ‘Sikh bloc’ or ‘Hindu bloc’.In the last 10 years, BJP has made a lot of efforts to get Dalits on its side. Elevating first-time MPs Vijay Sampla and Som Parkash, both belonging to Ad-dharmi/Ravidasia community, as Union ministers and then appointing Sampla as the first Dalit BJP state president were part of this exercise. However, its success has been limited to a few pockets till now.BJP’s challenge comes from two levels as most Dalits are Sikhs — comprising 19.4% of the total population — and Hindu Dalits, who comprise 12.4% of the total population, are not adherents of Hindutva politics.Uniquely, a major chunk of Hindu Dalits, especially the Ad-dharmi/Ravidasia community, are closer to Sikhs in religious practices. “Except for registering as Hindus in official records, a major section of Ad-dharmi/Ravidasias prefer to use caste identity instead of Hindu religious identity. In religious practices, they are closer to Sikhs than upper caste Hindus and their shrines are separate. This is a major factor in their politics too,” says Kulwinder Bagha, former sarpanch of Bolina village near Jalandhar, who belongs to the same community.Amid these fault-lines, BJP appears to be trying hard to make inroads into the Mazhabi Sikh/Balmiki community that is relegated to the lowest step of the caste ladder. Apart from fielding Mazhabi candidate Hans Raj Hans from Faridkot and Balmiki candidate Gejja Ram from Fatehgarh Sahib, BJP has also fielded a Mazhabi Sikh, Mandeep Singh Manna from Khadoor Sahib seat.Originally, Punjab SCs were a strong support base of Cong and Akalis. BSP disrupted Congress’s easy-going relationship with SCs and weakened it by taking away a section of Ravi dasia/Ad-dharmi voters.At least two BJP candidates have tried to play the caste card by talking on Jat Sikh vs Dalits divide. On April 25, when farmers gathered to protest against him in Jalandhar, BJP candidate Sushil Rinku called them “gundas” and “anti-Dalit” and claimed they were there to insult Dalits. Rinku, who belongs to the Ravidasia community, urged Dalits to boycott these “antiDalit farmers”. In Punjab, most farmers come from the Jat Sikh community.BJP’s Faridkot candidate Hans Raj Hans, who has a Mazhabi Sikh background, after facing several protests by farmers, said that his people were also heirs of Baba Jiwan Singh — a much respected Sikh warrior from the same caste, who brought the severed head of Ninth Sikh Master Guru Teg Ba hadur after his execution in Delhi to Guru Gobind Singh. This seemed not just an impulsive reaction but a careful positioning of Jat Sikh vs Mazhabi Sikhs.Reacting to Hans’s statements, Pendu Mazdoor Union, largely representing rural Dalit labourers, repeatedly issued statements alleging that BJP was playing its divisive agenda through its can didates and there was an attempt to create a wedge between farmers and Dalit labourers.Despite their same caste background, there are differences, mainly of religious identity and practices, between Mazhabi Sikhs and Hindu-Balmikis. The former are largely in rural areas and involved in farm labour and the latter are in urban areas. For Mazhabi Sikhs, it is only the caste card that can work, but for Balmiki-Hindu identity, BJP is already working at the level of religious identity by re peatedly highlighting that it named Ayodhya airport after Maharishi Valmiki.The caste factor among Mazhabi Sikhs/Balmikis has the potential to act on two levels as they can be positioned against Jat Sikhs and can compete with Addharmi/Ravidasias in the Dalit space. “BJP is making strong attempts for outreach among Balmikis. Though earlier also there were some people in our community aligned to them, this time their attempts appear unprecedented,” said Darshan Ratan Ravan, founder and head of Adi Dharam Samaj (ADS), a major organisation of Balmiki com munity in Punjab. He said that like other SC communities, apprehensions of changes in the Constitution among Balmikis also had percolated deep.When BJP fielded former Lok Sabha deputy speaker Charanjit Singh Atwal’s son Inder Iqbal Singh Atwal, a Mazhabi Sikh and a former SAD MLA, in Jalandhar bypoll last year, his caste card worked among sections of Mazhabi Sikhs/Bal mikis.“Things are much different in Punjab due to the Sikh Gurus’ influence across castes but still there are caste contradictions between upper and lower castes and within Dalits. There are regular discussions within well-informed Dalit circles and activists on how to tackle the emerging challenge when attempts are being made to widen the fault-lines for political purposes,” said Gian Chand, vice-president of All India Ad-Dharam Mission.For now, the perception of ‘change in the Constitution’ which seems to have travelled deep and wide among Dalits, can become the biggest roadblock for BJP.",The caste gambit played by Punjab’s then ruling Congress party in the 2022 assembly elections failed. Caste contradictions exist but they are not as deep and wide as in other northern states. Other parties are wary as Hindus account for 38.5% of the population and Sikh voters appear to be in a disarray.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110608886,imgsize-1162286,width-400,resizemode-4/110608886.jpg"
Non-Yadav OBC candidates take centre stage in the final phase today,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/non-yadav-obc-candidates-take-centre-stage-in-the-final-phase-today/articleshow/110608764.cms,"NEW DELHI: In the final phase of 2024 Lok Sabha elections in Uttar Pradesh , the main political parties have put their bet on non-Yadav candidates from the OBC community on a majority of seats. As many as 13 seats — Maharajganj, Gorakhpur, Kushinagar, Deoria, Ghosi, Salempur, Ballia, Ghazipur, Chandauli, Varanasi, Mirzapur, Bansgaon (reserved) and Robertsganj (reserved) — will see polling on Thursday.Out of 11 non-reserved seats, political parties have fielded non-Yadav OBCs candidates on seven seats. On three of these seats, non-Yadav OBCs are in a direct contest. In Mirzapur for instance, BJP ally Apna Dal (Sonelal) leader Anupriya Patel is taking on Ramesh Bind of the Samajwadi Party.Likewise, in Maharajganj BJP’s Pankaj Chaudhary is facing Congress MLA Virendra Chaudhary. Both the candidates are members of the Kurmi community. The third seat in this category is Salempur where Ravindra Kushwaha of the BJP is competing with Ramashankar Rajbhar of the SP.Of the remaining four, the other OBCs are the main candidates. This list includes Prime Minister Narendra Modi from Varanasi on the BJP ticket who is seen as the biggest non-Yadav OBC leader in the country now.BJP ally Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP), which largely represents the Rajbhar community, has given the ticket to Arvind Rajbhar from Ghosi. In Gorakhpur, INDIA bloc candidate Kajal Nishad is contesting against Ravi Kishan (a Brahmin) while in Kushinagar, the alliance is represented by Ajay Pratap Singh alias Pintu Sainthwar. Even the Bahujan Samaj Party has given importance to locally significant non-Yadav OBCs. In Kushinagar, the BSP has fielded Shubh Narayan Chahuhan, who belongs to the Lonia Chauhan community.These candidates have naturally made the communities they represent in the centre of political activity and their voting pattern would play a key role in the outcome. Aware of this, political parties have been making all out efforts to consolidate community votes, say election analysts.“The scramble for growth across communities and hope from reservation has been a universal phenomenon across UP. However, it has been more dominant in less developed areas like Purvanchal. Therefore, communities entitled for the benefits got consolidated under smaller political parties like the Apna Dal, SBSP, Mahan Dal or Janvadi party to be able to bargain better,” said Prof Sushil Pandey, faculty at Babasaheb Bhim Rao Ambedkar University, who has studied the caste politics in India in detail. He added that while the BJP talks about inclusivity and ‘Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas’ ideology, it leads the way in keeping in mind the caste factor by strategic deployment of candidates.“Data from various socio-political ends reveals that nearly 60% of the electorate on the 11 of 13 seats going to poll in this phase are OBCs. While Yadavs are present in significant numbers, different seats have the other OBCs as the next big dominating chunk,” he said. Based on his own study of the castes in UP, Prof Pandey said that Kurmis are dominant in seats of Mirzapur, Varanasi, Maharajganj, Kushinagar and Deoria. Likewise, Binds, who are also known as Nishads and Mallahs in different regions are dominant in Mirzapur, Varanasi and Gorakhpur seats.Chauhans (also known as Nonias) have significant presence in Ghazipur and Ghosi seats while Rajbhars become a dominant factor in Ghosi, Ghazipur and Ballia.","As many as 13 seats — Maharajganj, Gorakhpur, Kushinagar, Deoria, Ghosi, Salempur, Ballia, Ghazipur, Chandauli, Varanasi, Mirzapur, Bansgaon (reserved) and Robertsganj — will see polling on Thursday.

Congress Riding On Anti-Incumbency

BJP Banks On Mandir

AMRITSAR/JALANDHAR/LUDHIANA: Standing in the oppressive May heat with a sea of white in front of him, Congress MP from Amritsar Gurjeet Singh Aujla plays a recording on the microphone. His audience, all farmers, sit under the shade of a tent in Ajnala’s Jagdeep Khurd village, and listen intently. It’s an interview of a fellow MP extolling Aujla’s bravery as he overpowered the intruders who had barged into Parliament in Dec 2023 before security personnel took charge. Once the recording is over, Aujla tells the gathering, “We are fearless people whether it is in Parliament or the battlefield. You will never find a Punjabi who has hesitated to put his life on the line for the country.”The public — drawn from villages across the district — cheers and Aujla knows he has chalked himself another win. But the reference to the battlefield saddens Sukhjinder Singh, a sarpanch from the neighbouring Gujjarpura village, who is part of the crowd. He recalls how an Agniveer who had died on duty was refused a military salute at the funeral. “No compensation, job, or land… but no respect either? Did the martyr’s family not even deserve that?” he asks. It was only after roadblocks and protests that the soldier was given a ceremonial send-off by Punjab police.The Agniveer Scheme has only added to the already long list of complaints, he says. “Kisan de naal dhakka kitta (They have used forceful means against farmers),” he says. The world may have moved on, but the 358 days of protest against the farm laws at the Delhi border in 2021-22 still rankle and farmers have shown their anger by not allowing BJP candidates to campaign in villages where they hold sway. Videos of candidates and their cavalcades beating a hasty retreat are popular on social media.This anger has spilled over to urban areas as well since more than 60% of the state is involved in agriculture and allied professions. It would have been natural for Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), once known as ‘pinda di party’ (party of the villages) to capitalise on this frustration. “But people have been so disappointed by the party’s lacklustre support for the protests that it’s now fighting for survival,” says Ronki Ram, Shaheed Bhagat Singh Chair at Panjab University’s political science department.This has given Congress and AAP a tactical advantage. Barring a seat or two, the fight for Punjab’s 13 LS seats is between these two INDIA bloc parties, which have tied up for Delhi’s seven seats but are locked in battle here.AAP, which has an overwhelming majority of 92 of 117 seats in assembly, believes it has a strong pitch — free electricity up to 300 units, free PDS grain, and mohalla clinics are seen as popular among the urban poor. Delhi CM and AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal, who’s out on bail, raised the slogan “Sadda haq, aithe rakh” (give us our rights) at a rally last week, seeking to position AAP as a party that could take on BJP at Centre.Ludhiana’s Baljit Singh, who runs a small readymade store at Chander Nagar, says the power bill waiver has brought much-needed relief. “Business hasn’t picked up since Covid but expenses have been going up,” he says. He’s also used the mohalla clinic for a recent illness and was able to get medicines without any charge. “Kejriwal in his public rally at Amritsar said vote for me if you think I have done some work. It takes guts to say that. Have you heard any other candidate speak with such confidence?” he asks.Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann, too, has been at pains to point out his two-year-old govt’s achievements, but there is one uncomfortable question that he keeps side-stepping. At nearly every public meeting, among the first things Congress and BJP candidates ask women is if they’ve received the Rs 1,000 a month promised by Mann during assembly elections — and are met with a resounding ‘no’. Such is the embarrassment that he’s now hiked the cash stipend to Rs 1100, starting “soon”.Tactically, both Congress and BJP have trained their guns at AAP accusing the party of “jhoothe laare” or spinning lies. This has found some resonance with the urban middle class, which views the party as incapable of fulfilling crucial promises such as tackling drug trade and improving law and order.Guru Nanak Dev University’s political science professor Satnam Singh Deol describes it as ‘dantekatha’ or folktales that are passed on orally. Boliya kuch, te kitta kuch aur (promising one thing and doing another) is a common refrain. “They are following the Delhi model but that won’t work here,” he says. He also doesn’t think freebies alone will completely sway the Punjabi voter, who unlike the larger migrant population in Delhi, is typically more affluent and expects more.Ludhiana’s Kuldeep Kaur, who works in the billing section of a T-shirt manufacturing factory, regrets having fallen for the “ek maukaa” plea that helped AAP come to office in 2022. “We’ve got neither the women’s allowance nor the senior citizens’ pension. Congress has always worked for us, even helped us in times of need. They know how to run a govt,” she says.But with swathes of the Congress brass defecting to BJP, sentiment in favour of the party remains muted and candidate specific. The party sans its old warhorse Capt Amarinder Singh, who moved to BJP in 2022, is banking on antiincumbency both at Centre and in the state. Congress had won eight of the 13 seats in 2019 with a 40% vote share and is hoping for a repeat performance with Rahul Gandhi building a national narrative on a pro-poor welfarist plank.At Amritsar’s Hall Bazaar, in the shadow of the Partition Museum, autos with slogans “Jo ram ji ko lai hain, unko hum layenge (we will vote for those who have built Ram Mandir)” whizz past. Krishna Bhatia, 38, who owns a shop selling traditional juttis, says the mandir has been a strong emotional connect for Hindus. “We marked the consecration on this street with firecrackers. It was among the biggest celebrations in Punjab,” he says.Farm protests affected business and tourism slowed down too ever since the rail roko campaign started. “Every weekend there were 2 lakh to 4 lakh tourists coming to the Golden Temple and Wagah border. Hotels were full. During last year’s New Year, there were so many tourists that they had to spend the night at the Golden Temple. Now the streets are empty, and our business is down 20-25%,” he says.Ronki Ram says mandir may be an emotional draw but not so much an elec toral one. “Hindus in Punjab have been syncretic in nature and despite resentment against the farmers, mandir’s not an issue,” he says.But that hasn’t deterred shopkeeper and BJP pracharak Devender Arora from holding door-to-door meetings in the busy market of Ludhiana’s Chander Nagar. “People have realised that only Modi can protect them, we cannot depend on any other party for our security or progress,” he says. Metro, AIIMSlike hospitals, better infrastructure… the list of goodies on offer is seemingly endless and could help BJP increase its vote share as it goes alone in the state for the first time.As Punjab votes Saturday under a scorching sun, a local comic’s words are doing the rounds on social media: “Tin vaari cha ubalo, taan kodi ho jandi ai (If you boil tea thrice, it becomes bitter)”. It’s a veiled reference to BJP’s pitch for a third term. While the tea boils — for another three days, till June 4 — there isn’t much Punjab, or the nation, can do except some heated chai pe charcha.",Congress Riding On Anti-Incumbency and BJP Banks On Mandir.

It is not surprising, since the Congress usually opts out when it doesn’t expect results to go in its favour, but has no compunction showing up, if it thinks it has even an outside chance. Their hypocrisy is not lost on anyone. Let no one in Phase 7 waste their vote on them.""Further, the BJP chief also accused the Congress party of questioning exercises carried out by several professional agencies by boycotting the Exit Poll exercise.""Now by deciding to boycott the Exit Poll exercise, they are bringing into question exercise carried out by several professional agencies, who have worked with thousands of associates to bring what people may have voted for. Is it the Congress’s arguments that there is a big conspiracy, which includes millions of voters, and all of it is aimed at ridiculing the Congress for the next few days, when the actual result comes out on 4th of June? It doesn’t behove India’s grand old party to behave like a child, whose toy has been taken away. One expects certain level of maturity from the largest political party in the Opposition,"" he said.BJP leader Amit Malviya also taking a dig at the Congress said ""it might not be a bad idea"".""Congress concedes Lok Sabha 2024 on the eve of Phase 7 polling. It may not be a bad idea for the Congress to stay in their bunkers on 4th Jun too, since results are likely to more brutal than what exit pollsters may have to say.

""Our statement on the reason for not participating in #ExitPolls Voters have cast their votes and their verdict has been secured. The results will be out on 4th June.

Ex-colleagues slug it out in key Kolkata clash,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ex-colleagues-slug-it-out-in-key-kolkata-clash/articleshow/110608413.cms,"Trinamool Congress ’s Sudip Bandyopadhyay , 75, has won the Kolkata North seat ever since it was formed in 2009 irrespective of the opposition, be it Congress or BJP, but he has to see off the ‘challenge’ from a few within the party ranks this time. However, with chief minister Mamata Banerjee having thrown her weight behind him, Bandyopadhyay should be able to maintain his winning run.The simmering discontent within Trinamool ranks boiled over after the party’s long-time loyalist Tapas Roy defected to BJP. The departure of Roy, a vocal critic of Bandyopadhyay, after being in Trinamool for more than two decades reignited the conflict between the old guards and Young Turks in the party with Roy, 67, embodying the sentiments of the new generation. Irked over the disagreements on the renomination of Bandyopadhyay who also enjoys Mamata’s confi dence, Roy quit the party.On the face of it, Kolkata North is a Trinamool fortress. Bandyopadhyay won it in 2019 by more than 1.3 lakh votes, pocketing 50% of the votes polled. In an increasingly bipolar contest, BJP got 36.6%. In the 2021 state elections, Trinamool won all seven assembly segments which make up the Kolkata North LS constituency.“Sudip Da is not on good terms with most of the local functionaries, MLAs, and councillors in North Kolkata. Several disgruntled councillors will be indifferent or might play a passive role on the polling day, which is concerning,” said a senior Trinamool functionary from the constituency. Kolkata Municipal Corporation ward No.49 councillor Monalisa Banerjee went a step further by protesting openly and even joined sitin-demonstrations after being sidelined by Bandyopadhyay.On the other hand, when Roy was selected as Trinamool Congress president for North Kolkata, he became close with most of the councillors for his ‘open door’ policy.“We cannot forget Roy because we always had free access to his office and residence. As the chief of the party’s north Kolkata district, he would often listen to our problems and offer solutions,” said a councillor who represents a ward under Maniktala assembly constituency. Kunal Ghosh, who was removed from his party general secretary post for terming BJP candidate Roy the “most competent” in the fray, had also been critical of Bandyopadhyay. Ghosh has now buried the hatchet. Mamata and Kolkata mayor Firhad Hakim have asked councillors to throw their weight behind the party candidate.“The BJP candidate is trying to harm Sudip Da. He was arrested for no fault. But he did not leave the party even after his arrest. On the other hand, he (Roy) fled just because the ED raided him,” Mamata said at a public meeting.After 136 days in custody, Bandyopadhyay was granted bail by the Odisha High Court in May 2017 in the Rose Valley case. He was arrested by the CBI in Jan that year. Roy’s Bowbazar home was raided by ED on Jan 12 this year and he defected to BJP on March 4.Over the years, BJP has made considerable inroads in the constituency and gained some ground after young faces like Tamoghna Ghosh and Sajal Ghosh shifted from TMC to BJP. Many consider that Roy’s experienced leadership and his “straight-forward” image coupled with his expansive knowledge about the constituency will work as Bandyopadhyay’s “antidote.”Roy too has some limitations, such as a lack of a strong organisational support across the constituency. BJP has organised campaigns in northern pockets, but Roy knows there is a significant minority and anti-BJP vote in the constituency.Throughout his political career, Roy has practised secular politics but one of the questions that is doing the rounds is whether he can secure votes for Modi. While voters may not be dissatisfied with Roy, they have reservations about the BJP. There is scepticism in political circles about how much support he can garner for the party.“There is also uncertainty about Roy’s political future; whether he will stay with the BJP after the elections, regardless of win or lose. The voters and BJP’s lower-level workers too feel such an uncertainty,” said a BJP functionary from Kolkata North.The constituency has no Left candidates. Congress has fielded veteran Pradip Bhattacharya with the hope of breaking the TMC-BJP binary in the seat.Ironically, the three main candidates are former colleagues and acquaintances who have opposed the Left throughout their careers, but now find themselves contesting against each other, despite all being originally from Congress.","Sudip Bandyopadhyay, 75, has won the Kolkata North seat ever since it was formed in 2009.

Curious case of Shyam Rangeela & ‘chhoti si poll story’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/curious-case-of-shyam-rangeela-chhoti-si-poll-story/articleshow/110608230.cms,"For a long time, Prime Minister Narendra Modi , like millions of Indians, was Shyam Rangeela ’s hero, so much so that the comedian started mimicking his political idol, almost perfecting the PM’s signature ‘Bhaiyon, Behno’ greetings.With time, the equations changed. Citing restrictions on his work by a group of Modi supporters as a turning point, the self-proclaimed fan turned into a disillusioned critic .“Halfway into the show in which I was mimicking the PM, I was asked to walk out, and mend my ways. That day, I felt that my freedom was clipped. Later, I realised that such intimidation was common. Politicians are not so generous in taking humour and criticism,” says Rangeela, who was back in limelight recently when he announced to contest against Modi from Varanasi as an Independent candidate . While he came all the way from Rajasthan’s Sriganganagar to file nomination, a technical error of “not taking oath” while submitting papers led to the cancellation of his papers, and “shattering of a dream”.“It is disappointing but my rejection is also my victory. The cause of freedom for which I stood up got some attention,” he says, summing up his “chhoti si poll story”.Having taken “rejection” in his stride, Shyam is busy enjoying the moment, giving interviews, meeting journalists and influencers from different parts of the world.Sharing his ‘victim story’ with TOI, the comedian says, “Wo kehte they ki challenge ke bina maza nahi aata hai.(He used to say that life without a challenge was no fun). Why couldn’t Modi ji keep his words” he wonders, questioning his rejection. So, does he regret his decision of political misadventure?“Haan, main toh kahin ka nahi raha. BJP wale kehte hain ki maine Modi ji ka mazak banyaya. Congress wale kehte hain main Rahul ki mimicry ki hai. Mujhe dono taraf se kaam nahi milta hai. Chunav mein bahut paisa bhi kharch ho gaya hai to ab naya kaam dhoondh ke hisab theek karna hoga,” he says while claiming that he rejected offers to join opposition candidates and target Modi from a more robust platform.“I didn’t want to get tagged. In this way, I will prove my trollers right,” he says.Describing himself as the product of appreciation, Rangeela remains unaffected with what trollers have to say.“Jibes such as ‘mazak mazak mein serious ho gaya’ and ‘ghode pe aaya tha nomination bharne’ are very decent compared to allegations like my nomination was rejected because of a pending rape case against me,” he says while insisting that he will miss the love that people showered on him when he announced to contest poll from Kashi.The Kashi’ites, meanwhile, are enjoying the “free ka entertainment.”“Ab koi gudgudayega toh hansi toh ayegi hi. Waise Banaras mein maskharon ki kami nahi hai aur yaha par hasi thitholi ki parampara hai (one is bound to laugh when someone tickles the funny bone. By the way, there is no dearth of comedians in Banaras which has a tradition of appreciating humour),” remarked Hindi satirist and author Damdar Banarasi in the signature style.","Comedian Shyam Rangeela used to be a fan of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

"UP’s quiet Robertsganj ‘wishes for change’, but youth & tribal voters to have final say",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ups-quiet-robertsganj-wishes-for-change-but-youth-tribal-voters-to-have-final-say/articleshow/110608019.cms,"ROBERTSGANJ/SONBHADRA: A region of multiple terrains and river streams, Sonbhadra , the second largest district in Uttar Pradesh , comes alive during monsoon. Normally though, apart from the noise of the constant movement of heavy vehicles in and out of its factories and plants, the region remains mostly calm.Talk of a change, however, is getting louder as Robertsganj Lok Sabha constituency is set for polls on Saturday. Robertsganj, the headquarters of Sonbhadra district, has five assembly segments — Ghorawal, Obra, Duddhi, Robertsganj and Chakia — and an electorate of 17.8 lakh.Ramdev Gond, 58, a tribal from Basuda village in Chopan block, stresses the need for ‘badlav’ (change). “Our vote helps candidates go to Delhi, but I haven’t seen any major change taking place in my area in the last 10 years. I believe change is needed at this juncture.”Politicians will not overlook Ramdev, member of a tribal community that forms 20% of the electorate in Sonbhadra. Tribal hamlets in the district account for 3.9 lakh of UP’s 11.3 lakh ST population per Census 2011. Gonds alone are 45% followed by Kharwars (21%). Only SCs (23%) outnumber tribals in Robertsganj and share the potential to tilt the scales in someone’s advantage.Chhanbey MLA Rinki Singh Kol , 36, of NDA constituent Apna Dal (S) is locked in a direct fight with Samajwadi Party’s Chhotelal Kharwar, 51, for the seat. BSP has fielded Dhaneshwar Gautam, a lawyer.Rinki is the daughter-in-law of Pakaudi Lal Kol, who was the Robertsganj MP in 2009 with SP and in 2019 with Apna Dal (S). Her husband Rahul died of cancer. The family enjoys the backing of their Kol SC community, which has about 75,000 votes here.After making embarrassing remarks against upper castes at a public meeting in Oct 2021, Pakaudi Lal had to sacrifice his ticket as Apna Dal (S) chief Anupriya Patel did not want to invite their wrath in Sonbhadra and her own seat of Mirzapur.Pakaudi Lal had earlier pushed for the candidature of his younger son Jagprakash instead of Rinki. “Kols have a sizeable population in Mirzapur and, hence, pleasing the community is important for Anupriya. Picking Rinki appears to be wise as it becomes easier to target women voters across various castes,” said Jagat Narayan Vishwakarma, a journalist from Renukoot.In 2014, Pakaudi Lal, contesting on an SP ticket, finished third behind Kharwar, then a BJP candidate, and Sharada Prasad (BSP). In 2019, BJP handed the seat to Apna Dal and Pakaudi Lal made a strong comeback by winning 45.3% votes. In 2022 state polls, BJP swept all five assembly segments of Robertsganj LS seat.Yadavs have 1.3 lakh votes and Muslims nearly 60,000. Along with anti-incumbency, Rinki has to worry about resentment among upper caste members against Pakaudi Lal.It becomes evident that folk singer Kharwar has been on song and the SP camp upbeat about their campaign. A dedicated BJP worker and former pradhan of his village, Kharwar became MP twice only to be denied a ticket in 2019.Shalik Patel, 34, a driver from Arauli village on the outskirts of Robertsganj, said: “The ‘barat ghar’ (community centre) that was opened in our gram sabha in Aug 2011 collapsed within a few months. Not a single wedding could be held there. Villagers are using the damaged building as a shelter home for cattle. Pakaudi Lal has been elected multiple times and has started taking things for granted. BJP should have fielded a new face instead of his ‘bahu’.”Shiv Mohan, 45, a dhobi and a father of four, runs a small grocery shop in Kota, a village on the road to Garhwa district in Jharkhand, which still has a Naxal presence. “A decade ago, it was not possible to move out after sunset as Naxals used to target the Kon-Garhwa route. Maoists have shifted out of Sonbhadra and we feel secure while commuting in the night though unemployment is a big worry here,” said Mohan.Dubbed as the energy capital of India as it produces more than 10,000 MW power, many villages in Sonbhadra are not yet connected to the power grid and don’t have mobile phone services. Moreover, industries and manufacturing units that exploit the natural resources of the region offer limited jobs to local youths.“Only a few lucky people get employment. Earlier, ‘baniyas’ and ‘seths’ avoided offering jobs to locals as they felt that people who stay in remote villages are Naxal sympathisers,” said Shalik Patel from Arauli.Though the Maoist movement has been suppressed in Sonbhadra, its shadow still looms over the region. Voting will end at 4pm in 504 of the 1,295 polling stations in Robertsganj as a “precautionary measure”.With almost 40% of the area covered by forest, it takes up to five hours to commute between two farthest villages in the district. Ram Bhog Gond, a private employee in late 20s who works at a leading hotel near Badhauli crossing in Robertsganj, says elected representatives should ensure local youths get preference in jobs.“Local bodies, MLAs and MPs together with factory owners must ensure that 15-20% of unskilled and non-technical roles that require manual labour are set aside for local youths. We are among the few tribal families that moved out of the village in search of jobs,” he said.Rinki said: “I do not speak a lot during public meetings and rallies as I don’t feel there is a lot to say. I’m working hard to win the seat for the NDA alliance in UP.” She admitted unemployment was a major issue, adding that she was determined to address it.","Robertsganj Lok Sabha constituency is set for polls on Saturday.

It’s Bipolar Contest

SP’s Smart Ticket Distribution

Silent voter

Mandir, Jobs

LUCKNOW: With the marathon poll battle reaching its seventh and last round, polling will be held in its south-eastern region dominated by OBCs, Dalits and, of course, the Modi-Yogi factor. Hectic political activities worthy of a high-voltage contest are being witnessed in the run-up to the V-day. BJP ’s ‘Chanakya’ Amit Shah managed to win over two key leaders from Ballia, former minister Narad Rai and Ram Iqbal Singh, to make things easier for BJP’s candidate Neeraj Shekhar. The 13 seats going to the polls broadly come under the areas of influence of PM Narendra Modi and CM Yogi Adityanath.Most of these seats have the dominance of OBCs – Yadavs, Kurmis, Nishads, Kushwahas, Rajbhars, Nonias – Brahmins, Thakurs and Bhumihars are also in large numbers. In fact, this is the only region out of seven where Bhumihar votes play a role and send people’s representatives of their caste. To understand the pattern of this phase, one must understand the voting patterns seen in the past six phases.About two hours after phase 3 polling came to an end on May 7, in a surprise move, BSP chiefMayawati removed her nephew Akash Anand from the position of national coordinator and her political successor, barely five months after she had appointed him.According to political observers, the decision was not formed by Akash’s speeches which led to FIRs, but voting trend in the phase 3 which showed that a fraction of BSP’s core voters, Jatavs, were getting vocal about their ‘disillusionment’ with the party leadership and seen drifting away. While non-Jatavs have historically shifted towards BJP, this time, as a new trend, a few Jatavs were seen moving towards SP-Cong alliance as well. “That was the time when BSP chief Mayawatidecided to go for a safety and damage control exercise,” says a highly placed source.According to observers by removing Akash, BSP chief Mayawati wanted to save her nephew from failed launching as a section might begin associating his launching with the shift in Jatav votes -- though it thinned as election moved towards east. The phenomenon of the division in Jatav voters may come as an eye-opener for the BSP, which has remained complacent elections after elections for the past around three decades ever since Kanshi Ram began expanding the BSP by mainly wooing the Dalits.“There was a time when we all were steadily behind BSP,” says Mahesh Prasad of Batrauli in Kushinagar. However, in this election we will certainly look at the winnability of the candidates more than anything else, Prasad further says. Why to waste our vote just to prove loyalty when a BSP candidate is unable to throw a fight, questions Ram Bhor, a native of Kashipur village in Deoria.Observers see two main reasons behind the shift towards the Cong-SP alliance even though it may not be substantial. First, ever since the 2017 Assembly polls, Mayawati has failed to present a strong force in the state and even created a perception among the masses of not contesting the polls too strongly. Secondly, a section of Dalits,which had been traditionally with Congress before the ’90s when the BSP emerged as their last resort, saw some value in INDIA bloc narrative that if BJP comes to power with huge numbers it will remove their reservation and change the Constitution.However, the big question is whether the Congress-SP will be able to capitalise on this gain or whether BSP chief will rework on the strategy to regain the lost confidence of Jatavs on her and also counter yet another political threat rising slowly yet steadily from this poll onwards – Azad Party chief Chandrashekhar Azad.This drifting of Dalits and lack of ‘formidable’ BSP candidates has turned the contest bipolar on majority of seats, including 13 going to the polls. Varanasi, Gorakhpur, Ballia, Chandauli, Ghazipur, Ghosi, Kushinagar, Salempur all are witnessing a direct fight between BJP and INDIA bloc candidates. “It would mean that the winners will have to manage over 45-46% votes. A large number of BJP candidates had won by a large margin in 2019. Although INDIA bloc is getting a new set of voters, it will need to really jack up its tally of votes to bridge that gap,” says a political analyst.Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav has invested some thoughts in distributing tickets, even if that meant replacing the candidates several times. “He fielded just five Yadav candidates and four Muslims to avoid the tag of an M-Y party. It was also a bid to avoid any counter-polarisation against the party,” says a UP watcher, adding “he also kept caste equations in mind while deciding the names of candidates.”“He has fielded Rajiv Rai in Ghosi keeping in mind a large number of Bhumihars in the constituency,” he says, “this is the seat which belonged to Kalpnath Rai.” Similarly, constituencies like Kushinagar (Pintu Sainthwar), Ballia (Sanatan Pandey), Chandauli (Virendra Singh), Mirzapur (Ramesh Chand Bind) are examples of smart ticketing, keeping local caste considerations,” he adds.There are two sets of silent voters who are generally out of pollsters’ radar – women, especially the rural women, and beneficiaries. These voters which were neither heard of nor talked about earlier, seem to have not only gained prominence but also are gradually forming a strong and stable voter base. The more the rural women have been empowered even at home with facilities like toilets, Ujjwala scheme and an affordable house for the family, free ration, and improvement in law-and-order situation, the more they are becoming vocal and independent with their opinions.“Isme toh koi sandeh nahin hai ki Yogi raj mein koi darr nahi lagta hai kahin bahar jaane mein (There is no doubt that women are not scared of going out in Yogi govt),” Chanda Devi, a former pradhan at Rampurka Lal village in Deoria, says, giving a hint of her voting preference. Some 250 km away from Deoria, the voices in Basti are no different when it comes to getting the benefits of govt schemes. At Nathanpur village, around two kilometres off the Barabanki-Bahraich highway is Meera Devi (name changed) running a grocery shop to earn the living for her two children. “There is no doubt that fear among the women has come down in the past over six years,” she says, and adds that things need to further improve to give a free and fair society to the women.Although Ram Mandir is not being talked about, there is a huge chunk of voters who are keeping construction of temples at Ayodhya in mind. Lastly, the anti-incumbency against candidates at several places has only made BJP think-tank and workers toil harder than ever before.","Polling will be held in south-eastern region dominated by OBCs, Dalits and, of course, the Modi-Yogi factor. The 13 seats going to the polls broadly come under the areas of influence of PM Narendra Modi and CM Yogi Adityanath.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110607830,imgsize-1328886,width-400,resizemode-4/110607830.jpg"

Some called it “Mission Impossible”. Treacherous terrain in Maoist strongholds, steep Himalayan slopes, and the Chinese frontier; bedbugs , sex workers and a slum; rain, mudslides, and jungles infested with mosquitoes and leeches; personal grief and health challenges. But election personnel — school teachers, administrative staff, and other govt employees — demonstrated remarkable commitment and courage in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections to ensure nearly 970 million voters, over 10% of the world’s population, could exercise their franchise. These compelling tales from the frontlines evoke the essence of a modern-day “Rediscovery of India”, embodying the spirit of Bharat Ek Khoj and the nation’s democracy.In the rugged landscape of Uttarakhand , polling parties undertook strenuous treks to remote villages twice — once for elderly voters above 85 years old and again on the main polling day. For instance, a polling party of six, including a policeman, navigated a four-hour trek to Kalgot village in Chamoli district on April 8, which falls under Pauri Garhwal Lok Sabha seat, to ensure elderly women could vote, then returned for the rest of the village’s 350 voters.Sector magistrate Surya Prakash Maithani, who led the team, said: “Although govt officials are accustomed to election duty, undertaking such a challenging journey twice within two weeks was a task that could have been avoided in remote areas with no road connectivity.”In Pithoragarh district, another team faced an 80km bus journey and 16km trek, only to find a voter boycott over the lack of road connectivity. Only eight people — four villagers and as many polling officials — cast votes out of 587 registered voters.Rukmini Patnaik, a PWD engineer, served as a presiding officer at a polling booth in Bhubaneswar’s Kharvela Nagar. The booth, located near a slum with many sex workers and ragpickers, was a “pink booth” staffed entirely by women. Patnaik and her team were provided rudimentary accommodations in a primary school, where they had to sleep on insect-infested floors, making rest nearly impossible. The incessant biting of the bedbugs left her with itchy welts. Sanitation was poor, with one unclean toilet shared by over 30 people, forcing Patnaik to avoid using it for two days.“I can never forget the two nights of poll duty,” Patnaik said. “We could hear the conversations between sex workers and their clients in the nearby slum until 3am. A lactating woman police officer couldn’t feed her child for two days, leading to intense physical pain and mental trauma. Despite all the challenges, the only satisfaction we have is that we were able to fulfil our duty.”Primary school assistant teacher Anil Kumar Goswami had conducted many elections, but the experience of 2024 stands out vividly. He was part of a group of about 15 people, including his fourmember team of election officials, along with police and forest personnel, and a lekhpal, entrusted with the task of conducting polling at Bharthapur village — a remote settlement near the Nepal border in UP’s Bahraich parliamentary constituency.Their departure itself was a scene reminiscent of a grand adventure. A musical band played as they began their 160km journey. Bahraich district magistrate Monika Rani said: “We made them wear pagdis and gave them a festive send-off with dhols, balloons, flowers, and the tricolour adorning their bus and boat to motivate them.”The team travelled by bus, then 60km in an SUV through the dense, mysterious forest of Katarniya, and boarded a boat adorned with marigolds to cross the confluence of Girwa and Kauriala rivers.“The river, teeming with crocodiles, can be quite disconcerting. I saw crocodiles and even rhinos during my previous visit to Bharthapur,” Rani said. Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) troopers escorted the team from the riverbank to the booth.The voter turnout was modest. Out of 802 registered voters, only 313 cast their ballots on May 13. Yet, Anil’s sense of fulfilment was undiminished.“It was worth contributing to the world’s largest democratic process,” said the presiding officer whose team included Neelesh Gaur, Arthika Verma, and Ram Naresh.In Maharashtra’s Gadchiroli, polling personnel faced lifethreatening situations as helicopters dropped them into Maoist territory . Located in the dense Dandakaranya forests, these polling stations straddled 100km of the Red Corridor along the Chhattisgarh border.Govt school teachers, escorted by commandos, trekked through booby-trapped, dangerous terrain and spent a night in the open — sleeping on a tarpaulin sheet in the rain-soaked jungle, avoiding detection by not lighting a torch or setting up a fire. “Lurking cobras and mosquitoes in the blinding darkness of the jungles were as lethal as IEDs,” said one teacher. Their efforts enabled villagers of Arewada, who had rarely voted due to Maoist threats and the risks of trekking long distances, participate in the democratic process for the first time in 77 years.Surendra Yadav, an employee of Tandwa high school in Jharkhand’s Chatra district, was assigned election duties for Chatra Lok Sabha constituency, which voted on May 20. His assignment took him to Pathel village in the Maoistdominated Kanhachatti block. Yadav, along with four other polling officials, reached the booth after a 12km journey on foot through hilly terrain. Despite fears, the local warmth saw 670 of 1,072 electors vote. “We were apprehensive…but the locals were welcoming. The area was lush green and surrounded by hills, offering a scenic view,” Yadav recounted.Jitendra Kumar Sahi, a Jharkhand govt employee, has been conducting elections since 1998. Despite having only one kidney since 2007 due to an ailment, Sahi’s physical limitations have not deterred him from his duty. For 2024, he was deputed as a polling official at the govt primary school in Fasia, under Gumla assembly segment of Lohardaga (ST) Lok Sabha constituency, which voted on May 13. “I have had a single kidney since 2007. Even then, I have been involved in conducting elections as a polling official,” Sahi said.Vadodara DC and deputy district election officer Vivek Tank lost his wife, Pragya Balasara, to cancer on April 27. However, Vivek returned to his election duties on April 30 after her cremation in Gondal. He cast his vote via postal ballot and prepared for the May 7 polls. Vivek, who married Pragya in 2018 after meeting during their GPSC exam preparations, chose not to pass on his responsibilities, stating that doing so would be like “leaving a battle midway”.Hill hikes, a sleepless night when the jungle comes alive, no electricity or mobile network — four election officials, and the smallest polling booth in the heart of India. Located 90km from the district headquarters, Sonewani in Maoist-affected Balaghat district of Madhya Pradesh has 10 homes and 42 voters.Starting a day early for the April 19 polls, the team arrived using jungle shortcuts. They relied on the villagers’ hospitality for food and light.They faced fears of wild animals and a storm that night, with a tree crashing outside their booth. Their perseverance included locating the last voter by climbing onto the school roof for a weak mobile signal. “Booth-level officer Chaturbhuj Rana learnt that he was once his student. The voter could not refuse his teacher’s request and made it by 4pm, and we ensured 100% voting,” said presiding officer Mamraj Singh Markam.Election staff deployed to Bodhaimalai in Namakkal district of Tamil Nadu thought it was just another remote polling booth until they reached the foothills on April 18. They realised the challenge ahead — an 8km uphill trek. Two polling stations, one at Keelur with 845 voters and Kedamali with 297 voters, awaited them atop Bodhaimalai.“The journey began around 9am and took seven long hours of trekking in sweltering summer heat,” said a polling officer. Local porters carried EVMs, VVPATs, and stationery. The return journey, starting late in the eve ning, was equally arduous. In pitch dark, the team navigated back down, reaching their destination around 1am on April 20, using torchlights. Some suffered cuts and bruises.A polling team’s three-day, 150km journey to Arunachal Pradesh’s Gate village involved navigating precarious slopes and heavy rain along the Chinese border. They started on April 16, travelling by vehicle, then continuing on foot from Malo, the last motorable village. “We reached Gate on April 18, welcomed by villagers with food,” said presiding officer Toni Dupak, a PWD junior engineer. “The journey was perilous…Leeches were a constant nuisance. We carried instant noodles, light foods, and chocolates,” Dupak recounted.Banej, a secluded village in Gujarat’s Gir Somnath district, set up a polling booth for its sole voter, a temple priest.A team of 15, including security personnel, was deployed.“There is no electricity or mobile network. We were totally cut off,” said presiding officer Sursinh Padhiyar. The team stayed at the forest department’s field office and was provided meals by the priest. Banej maintains a 100% voting record.Shiyal Bet, an island surrounded by the Arabian Sea, is part of Amreli parliamentary constituency. The island, with a population of 10,000 and 5,100 registered voters, primarily sees women voters due to men being away for fishing. A team of 60, including security and health officials, conducted the election across five booths. “We had to consider tide timings and brought medicines and medical practitioners,” said polling official Ramesh Maru. The team travelled by boat and carried food packets and dry snacks, with villagers also providing meals.","In the world’s largest democracy, the journey to conduct elections can be as arduous as it is significant.

Cong (Santokh Singh Chaudhary), AAP ( Sushil Kumar Rinku won in 2023 bypoll)Charanjit Singh Channi (Cong), Sushil Kumar Rinku ( BJP ), Pawan Kumar Tinu (AAP), Mohinder Singh Kaypee (SAD)It’s a battle of turncoats, and a former chief minister. BJP’s candidate Sushil Kumar Rinku quit Congress and joined AAP in 2023 to win the Jalandhar bypoll after sitting MP Santokh Singh Chaudhary’s death . Rinku, who was AAP’s only MP in Lok Sabha, switched over to BJP earlier this year. After this blow, AAP nominated two-time MLA Pawan Kumar Tinu as he quit SAD. The Akali Dal, too, picked former Punjab PCC president Mohinder Singh Kaypee to fight the election. Nominating former CM Charanjit Singh Channi is Congress’s move to reclaim its dominance in Jalandhar. The seat was a Congress stronghold till the party’s shock defeat in the 2023 bypoll. But Channi’s nomination angered Karamjit Kaur, the wife of MP Santokh Chaudhary, and she jumped ship to the saffron camp. Her MLA son Vikramjit Singh Chaudhary launched a tirade against Channi, prompting the party to suspend him. Channi is the only Dalit to have held the state’s top post even though SCs form the largest chunk of population.BJP (Ravi Kishan)Ravi Kishan (BJP), Kajal Nishad (SP), Javed Ashraf (BSP)This east UP seat was represented by CM Yogi Adityanath five times. In 2019, Adityanath ‘blessed’ Bhojpuri star Ravi Kishan to claim his seat and win it. This was despite Kishan’s loss from Jaunpur in 2014 as a Congress candidate. Kishan is back again, riding on a slew of development projects that Yogi govt initiated. Kajal Nishad, also a Bhojpuri singer and actor famous for serials such as Laapataganj, has made it a battle of artists. Samajwadi Party has fielded her to cash in on large number of Nishad voters, who supported Pravin Nishad, then an SP candidate, to see him through in the 2018 bypoll.ADS (Anupriya Patel)Anupriya Patel (ADS), Ramesh Chand Bind (SP), Manish Tripathi (BSP)Union minister Anupriya Patel of Apna Dal (Soneylal) is seeking a third term from the constituency where Kurmi voters tilt the equation. Her camp was unfazed after Kunda MLA Raghuraj Pratap Singh, popularly called ‘Raja Bhaiya’, announced that he will campaign against Patel who said, “In a democracy, kings are born from EVMs.” SP has fielded Ramesh Chand Bind, BJP’s Bhadohi MP who was denied a ticket, and BSP’s candidate Manish Tripathi is a trusted party worker. The seat has a sizeable presence of Nishad and Brahmin voters. Brahmins have backed Patel in the past but Tripathi’s candidature could play spoilsport.TMC (Mala Roy)Mala Roy (TMC), Debasree Chaudhuri (BJP), Saira Shah Halim (CPM)Starting 1991, Kolkata South never elected anyone but Mamata Banerjee. And after she became the CM in 2011, the constituency always elected her party candidate. Kolkata South is synonymous with Mamata — it is where her home is; it is also from here in Bhowanipore that she has been elected to the state assembly. A Trinamool bastion, the constituency threw up a scare in 2014 LS polls when the party’s vote share dropped below 40%. But even then, Trinamool’s victory margin was 1.3 lakh over its nearest rival. In its attempt to make inroads into Bengal, BJP has nominated different candidates from Kolkata South since 2009 (the last being Chandra Kumar Bose in 2019) though none could win. Still, BJP’s vote bank has slowly and steadily risen – a mere 4% in 2009 to 34.6% in 2019. Up against Trinamool’s might is Raiganj MP and former Union minister of state Debasree Chaudhuri of BJP, who has campaigned in the name of PM Modi. CPM, which has fielded Saira Shah Halim, is banking on rekindled support for the Left.BJP (Ram Swaroop Sharma), Cong (Pratibha Singh won the 2021 bypoll)Vikramaditya Singh (Cong), Kangana Ranaut (BJP)In this closely watched battle, Bollywood actor Kangana Ranaut, a political greenhorn, is taking on seasoned politician Vikramaditya Singh, Congress MLA and scion of the erstwhile Bushahr princely state. Ranaut’s popularity is enough to get droves to her rallies, while Vikramaditya is banking on the legacy of his father Virbhadra Singh, six-time CM and three-time MP from Mandi. His mother Pratibha Singh is the sitting MP, having won the seat in the 2021 bypoll. Though Ranaut hails from Bhambla village of Mandi, Congress has been portraying her as an outsider. She has not raised any local issues, and is apparently relying on the Modi factor for this election. Mandi, which includes 17 assembly segments that cover six of the state’s 12 districts, is the largest parliamentary constituency in Himachal. It includes the tribal belts of Bharmour and Lahaul-Spiti, Kullu, Manali, Mandi, Kinnaur and Shimla.BJP (Virendra Singh)Neeraj Shekhar (BJP), Sanatan Pandey (SP), Lallan Singh Yadav (BSP)Neeraj Shekhar, son of former PM Chandra Shekhar, is back in the land of ‘Baghi Ballia’ — which had declared itself independent during the Quit India movement — to reclaim his legacy. Chandra Shekhar had won this seat eight times. After his death, SP fielded Neeraj in the 2007 Lok Sabha bypoll. Neeraj won, and retained the constituency in 2009, but lost in 2014. SP sent him to Rajya Sabha as the constituency, like most in UP, rode the saffron wave till 2019. Neeraj, meanwhile, switched over to BJP. Pitted against him is SP’s Sanatan Pandey, a socialist, who quit his job as junior engineer in a govt department to join the party in 1996. Pandey was elected MLA from the now-dissolved Chilkahar in 2007, but lost from Rasra in the next two polls. SP fielded him from Ballia LS seat in 2019 and he lost narrowly to Virendra Singh. Pandey is hopeful that over 15% Brahmin voters will see him through. Dalits, who are in equal numbers, may hold the deciding vote.TMC (Sudip Bandyopadhyay)Sudip Bandyopadhyay (TMC), Tapas Ray (BJP), Pradip Bhattacharya (Cong)Kolkata North has elected TMC ‘old guard’ Sudip Bandyopadhyay thrice in succession since the Lok Sabha constituency was formed in 2009. And Trinamool won all seven assembly segments here in the 2021 state polls. This election, Bandyopadhyay’s battle for a fourth term is against BJP and several functionaries of his own party. The MP is pitted against party colleague-turned-adversary Tapas Ray. His poll-eve defection to BJP has turned some Trinamool loyalists against each other and given jitters to party old-timers. Ray is a known face in the region and commands strong ground support here.TMC (Nusrat Jahan)Haji Nurul (TMC), Rekha Patra (BJP), Nirapada Sardar (CPM)Sandeshkhali, one of the seven assembly segments in Bashirhat LS constituency, has injected unpredictability in what has been a predictable poll script for the past decade and a half. Trinamool won the parliamentary seat in 2019 by a margin of 3.5 lakh votes despite a surge of BJP support in Bengal. Sensing a tough battle, Trinamool has brought back former MP from the seat Haji Nurul to take the fight to BJP’s Rekha Patra, a prominent face of the Sandeshkhali protests. A seat that has two scheduled caste (SC) assembly segments and one reserved for scheduled tribes (ST), the controversy over sexual abuse of women by local politicians is bound to resonate beyond small pockets. Those backing TMC point to its rebuttal that the allegations were false and a conspiracy. Either way, Bashirhat is among Bengal’s closely watched contests.BJD (Anubhav Mohanty)Baijayant Panda (BJP), Anshuman Mohanty (BJD)In the karmabhoomi of party ideologue Biju Patnaik, BJD has been focusing on its progress agenda, promoting “Biju babu’s vision of a developed and industrialised Odisha”. To maintain its unbeaten record in Kendrapara, BJD nominated Anshuman Mohanty, a former Congress MLA, to take on BJP’s Baijayant Panda. Anshuman’s father Nalinikanta Mohanty was a prominent figure in BJD, having risen to the position of working president under Naveen Patnaik’s leadership before his unceremonious exit over statements made against the party leadership. Baijayant was elected twice from the seat on a BJD ticket — in 2009 and 2014. As a BJP nominee, he lost to BJD’s Anubhav Mohanty in the 2019 elections.","Jalandhar is a battle of turncoats, and a former chief minister. Sushil Kumar Rinku quit Congress and joined AAP in 2023 to win the Jalandhar bypoll after sitting MP Santokh Singh Chaudhary’s death. Kolkata South is synonymous with Mamata Banerjee — it is where her party is always elected.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110607657,imgsize-1328886,width-400,resizemode-4/110607657.jpg"

With several TMC heavyweights contesting, from party general secy and Mamata’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee to veterans Sudip Bandyopadhyay, Saugata Roy, Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar and Mala Ray, it is a prestige battle for the party. The spotlight is also on Basirhat, which includes the assembly segment of Sandeshkhali. A Trinamool stronghold, it is now enmeshed in allegations of atrocities against women by TMC netas and an ongoing legal battle.It’s a vital election for all parties and panthic candidates banking on the Sikh vote. CM Mann has led the campaign in the absence of Kejriwal, and a good show by AAP will help cement his position in the party and state. After losing the 2022 assembly polls, Congress hopes to emerge as the party with a majority of the 13 seats — it had won 8 in 2019 — but divisions within will be a big hurdle. Having consistently lost vote share after losing to Congress in the 2017 assembly polls, Sukhbir hopes to turn the tide, the focus being on his wife Harsimrat’s seat. BJP, going solo, is eyeing an increased vote share and bigger footprint.The ﬁnal frontier of eastern UP comprises the home turfs of PM Modi and CM Yogi Adityanath. Of the 13 seats going to the polls in this phase, nine were won by BJP in 2019 and two by its ally Apna Dal (S). BSP had won two. In this phase, OBCs — Yadavs, Kurmis, Kushwahas, Rajbhars — play a crucial role while Dalits and upper castes have their pockets of inﬂuence and can tilt the balance in some seats. In Bihar, the oppn alliance is hoping to reclaim some of the lost ground.BJP (Narendra Modi)Narendra Modi (BJP), Ajay Rai (Cong), Ather Jamal Lari (BSP)If it’s ‘ab ki baar 400 paar’ for BJP nationally, in Varanasi, it is ‘ab ki baar 10-lakh paar’. The talk is only about the winning margin as PM Modi is conﬁdent of a third stint as MP from here. Will he cross the 66% voter share and beat former PM Chandra Shekhar’s record? Or will he beat his own margin record of 4.8 lakh votes (63%) in 2019? Modi’s choice of Varanasi in 2014 was seen as a masterstroke, and the consequent BJP victory has done the temple town and adjoining constituencies a lot of good. The only spoiler: high temperatures. Modi’s rival here is Ajay Rai, whom Congress has retained since 2014. Rai polled 75,000 and 1.5 lakh votes in 2014 and 2019 respectively and on both occasions, ﬁnished third. This time, he is the joint candidate of INDIA bloc and that might improve his tally. BSP’s Lari is a veteran who started his career with Janata Party and contested an LS poll for the ﬁrst time in 1984. Since then, he has been associated with Apna Dal, Qaumi Ekta Dal, SP and now BSP. But he is yet to win an election.BJP (Ravi Shankar Prasad)Ravi Shankar Prasad (BJP), Anshul Avijit (Cong)BJP has won the seat in all three elections held since it was formed in 2009 following reorganisation of Patna LS constituency into Patna Sahib and Patliputra. While the old Patna seat was a bastion of Congress, Left and socialists, Patna Sahib is a BJP stronghold – 4 of the 6 assembly segments here are represented by BJP and 2 by RJD. Former law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad is locked in a straight ﬁght with Anshul Avijit, son of ex-LS Speaker Meira Kumar, for this Kayastha-dominated seat. It has become a matter of prestige for both NDA and oppn: while Modi held a road show in Patna — the ﬁrst by any PM here — Rahul too addressed a rally, only the second seat under Congress’ quota in Bihar for which he campaigned.BJP (Ram Kripal Yadav)Ram Kripal Yadav (BJP), Misa Bharti (RJD)This is one of the seats where Lalu Prasad’s prestige is at stake. It has remained with NDA since it was formed in 2009, with BJP winning it last two times. RJD has never tasted victory in the constituency even though all six assembly segments here are held by the opposition alliance. Like in 2014 and 2019, Lalu’s eldest daughter Misa Bharti is locked in a direct ﬁght with BJP’s Ram Kripal Yadav. Lalu actively campaigned for his daughter, braving the scorching sun and ignoring his health issues. On the other hand, PM Modi did night stays in Patna twice and addressed a rally. Lalu also befriended Ranjan Yadav ahead of polls and entered an alliance with CPI-ML to avoid a split in secular votes to ensure victory of his daughter. The battle looks very tough.BJP (RK Singh)RK Singh (BJP) and Sudama Prasad (CPI-ML)Once the stronghold of Congress and socialists, Arrah has been backing BJP candidates the last two elections. In the last LS polls, BJP’s RK Singh, a former bureaucrat, defeated the CPI-ML candidate by a margin of nearly 1.5 lakh votes. This time again, he is locked in a straight ﬁght with the CPI-ML candidate but a uniﬁed campaign by the INDIA bloc has posed a serious challenge. In 1989, Indian People’s Front (IPF), founded by Vinod Mishra, had created history when its candidate Rameshwar Prasad emerged victorious from this seat which has been a hotbed of Maoist activities. Out of seven assembly segments under this parliamentary constituency, three are held by RJD and two by CPI-ML while the remaining two are with BJP.TMC (Abhishek Banerjee)Abhishek Banerjee (TMC), Abhijit Das (BJP), Pratikur Rahaman (CPM)In the last decade, Diamond Harbour has become synonymous with Abhishek Banerjee. Since his electoral debut in 2014, Diamond Harbour – a Left bastion since 1952 – has also risen in prominence in national politics along with its MP, now the party general secretary. From the Diamond Harbour assembly segment in the extreme south to Metiabruz assembly segment, closer to Kolkata, Trinamool holds a vicelike grip in all seven assembly belts in this LS. The constituency has a substantial minority population. Abhishek faces a triangular ﬁght against BJP and the CPMCongress alliance. But like all Lok Sabha seats in Bengal, he will also face a steady BJP rise in vote share from 3% in 2009 to over 33% in 2019.Cong (Preneet Kaur)Preneet Kaur (BJP), Dharamvir Gandhi (Cong), Balbir Singh (AAP)Preneet Kaur, wife of former CM Amarinder Singh and sitting MP, is hoping to retain the seat of the Patiala royal family, after switching to BJP from Congress. PM Modi and several high-proﬁle BJP netas have thrown their weight behind her, though Amarinder has been missing from the campaign due to ill-health. Former AAP MP and Congress candidate Dr Dharamvir Gandhi has a strong following here and both Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka have campaigned for him. AAP too is eyeing the seat, with both CM Mann and Kejriwal campaigning for state minister Balbir Singh. Balbir was Gandhi’s campaign manager in 2014 when he contested on an AAP ticket.SAD (Harsimrat Kaur Badal)Harsimrat Kaur Badal (SAD), Gurmeet Singh Khudian (AAP), Jeet Mohinder Singh Sidhu (Congress)Badal family bahu and sitting MP Harsimrat Kaur faces a multi-cornered contest. Her immediate rival is AAP’s Gurmeet Singh Khudian, the agriculture minister who defeated her father-in-law and ﬁve-time CM Parkash Singh Badal from Lambi in the 2022 assembly election. Cong’s Jeet Mohinder Singh Sidhu, a four-time MLA from Talwandi Sabo, switched from Congress to SAD and back between 2015 and 2023. BJP’s candidate is Parampal Kaur Sidhu, former IAS ofﬁcer and daughter-in-law of former Akali minister Sikandar Singh Maluka.","PM Modi’s hat-trick bid in Varanasi grabbing the spotlight.

He exuded confidence that the opposition would oust BJP from office.“In Congress, our great leader Rahul Gandhi is there. Why should they unnecessarily bring my name?

If anybody asks me, my preference will be Rahul (for the PM’s post),” he added.Kharge said he had urged Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi to contest from Amethi and Rae Bareli respectively but Rahul was hesitant to fight out of concern that he had to campaign across the country and there would be nobody to take care of his campaign. He said Priyanka sat out the elections to become Rahul’s campaign manager in Rae Bareli.“We wanted Rahul to be free to campaign across the country.

"Rishi Sunak sees 78 Tory MPs exit ahead of July poll, surpassing 1997 exodus before Tony Blair's win",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/rishi-sunak-sees-78-tory-mps-exit-ahead-of-july-poll-surpassing-1997-exodus-before-tony-blairs-win/articleshow/110445174.cms,"Britain's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak (AFP photo)

There were tears, anger and frustration as many Conservative lawmakers digested their PM Rishi Sunak 's decision to call the UK elections on July 4, much earlier than they had ever expected.

Some of those fighting to retain their seats feared the six weeks left to convince skeptical voters to back them would not be enough. For others planning to stand down, it meant an abrupt end to their political careers , forced to clear out their offices months earlier than planned.Trailing Labour by over 20 percentage points in polls, Sunak, analysts said, is betting that the Tories can cut their losses by facing the voters.

But a grassroots Conservative campaign coordinator said that the morale was the lowest he had known in five decades. Tory members of parliament seem to share this sense of futility: 78 of them have opted not to contest their seats, an exodus that includes Michael Gove, who once vied for party's top post and has been at the heart of nearly every Conservative-led govt since David Cameron's in 2010. Other high profile figures who have announced they will not seek re-election include former PM Theresa May, Northern Ireland minister Chris Heaton- Harris, ex-armed forces minister James Heappey and ex-defence minister Ben Wallace.

The number of Tories exiting is more than the previous post-1945 high of 72 who quit prior to Tony Blair's 1997 landslide win for Labour, which is expected to triumph again. The departures add to a feeling that the Conservatives are on track to be kicked out of power after 14 years, although Labour require a big swing to secure a majority. Sunak's decision to go to the polls early has triggered fears that he's leading the party to one or more ""Portillo"" moments - when a Tory big beast loses a safe seat in an election whitewash - named for the time cabinet minister Michael Portillo lost in Enfield Southgate in 1997.

The eighth seat in the last phase – Karakat – is being contested by the Rashtriya Lok Morcha where party president Upendra Kushwaha is contesting. On the other hand, RJD has fielded three, CPI-ML three and Congress two candidates from the opposition INDIA bloc in the last phase.Prominent among those whose fate will be sealed in the final phase of Lok Sabha elections are Union minister R K Singh (Ara), Former Union minister Ravishankar Prasad (Patna Sahib), Ram Kripal Yadav (Patliputra), Misa Bharti (Patliputra), Kaushlendra Kumar (Nalanda), Upendra Kushwaha (Karakat) and Independent candidate Pawan Singh (Karakat).There are 29 candidates in the fray in Nalanda, 17 in Patna Sahib, 22 in Patliputra, 14 each in Ara and Buxar, 10 in Sasaram, 13 in Karakat and 15 in Jehanabad. Among the 1,62,04,594voters in the eight constituencies, there are 85,01,620 men, 77,02,559 women and 415 third gender.Stakes are particularly high for the BJP in the final phase as it seeks to retain five of these seats, which made up for more than a quarter of its state-wide tally of 17.Union minister R K Singh is aiming at a hat-trick from Ara, where his principal challenger is Sudama Prasad, a sitting MLA of the CPI(ML) which has expanded its footprint in the state rapidly ever since it allied with the RJD and the Congress ahead of assembly polls and came up with best-ever performance of 12 seats.In Patna Sahib, veteran BJP parliamentarian Ravi Shankar Prasad is aiming at a second consecutive term. His principal challenger is Congress spokesperson Anshul Avijit, whose mother Meira Kumar is a former Lok Sabha speaker, and his late maternal grandfather Jagjivan Ram had been a deputy PM.In Patliputra, RJD president Lalu Prasad’s eldest daughter Misa Bharti is trying her luck for the third time. BJP MP Ram Kripal Yadav, a former close aide of Prasad and ex-Union minister, is aiming at a hat-trick here.In Nalanda, the home district of CM Nitish Kumar, sitting MP Kaushlendra Kumar hopes to retain the seat for the party for a record fourth-term. He is up against Sandeep Saurav, a sitting CPI(ML) MLA and former JNU students’ union leader.Karakat is witnessing a multi-cornered fight, which is being most talked about because of Bhojpuri superstar Pawan Singh, who is contesting as an Independent. Singh entered the fray after having earlier turned down a BJP ticket from Asansol in West Bengal. The move has led to his expulsion from the party. Upendra Kushwaha, a former Union minister who heads the Rashtriya Lok Morcha, had won the seat in 2014 but lost it five years later upon quitting NDA. He is hopeful of wresting the seat back following return to the BJP-led coalition. The CPI(ML), which has a strong presence in the area, has fielded Raja Ram Kushwaha, a former MLA and farmer leader.In Sasaram, the BJP has dropped two-term MP Chhedi Paswan to field Shivesh Ram, a former MLA and party’s state general secretary. The reserved seat has formerly been a Congress bastion, with Jagjivan Ram and Meira Kumar together winning it nine times. However, Kumar has backed out of the race and her party has fielded Manoj Kumar, a recent entrant who was formerly with the BSP headed by ex-CM of UP Mayawati.In Jehanabad, the JD(U) has reposed its trust in sitting MP Chandeshwar Prasad Chandravanshi, whose victory margin in 2019, of less than 2,000 votes, was the lowest for any of the 40 constituencies in Bihar. The RJD candidate is Surendra Prasad Yadav, the runner-up of 2019, who had won the seat in 1998.In Buxar, the BJP sprung a surprise by denying Union minister Ashwini Kumar Choubey the chance to run for a third consecutive term. The party hopes its candidate Mithilesh Tiwari, a former MLA and state vice president, will retain the seat. However, Tiwari’s bid has met a strong challenge from RJD’s Sudhakar Singh, a sitting MLA whose father Jagadanand Singh heads the party’s state unit and had won the Buxar seat in 2009. Queering the pitch, Anand Mishra, a former Assam cadre IPS officer, who resigned from service nursing political ambitions but did not get a ticket from the BJP which had allegedly promised the same, is also contesting as an Independent.","Voting began at 7 am in Nalanda, Patna Sahib, Pataliputra, Ara, Karakat, Jehanabad, Buxar and Sasaram (SC) Lok Sabha seats.

"Day before Punjab polls, Behbal Kalan trial moved from Faridkot to Chandigarh",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/day-before-punjab-polls-behbal-kalan-trial-moved-from-faridkot-to-chandigarh/articleshow/110609021.cms,"‘Justice delayed again’

BATHINDA: Day before the Lok Sabha elections in Punjab, the trial in the October 2015 Behbal Kalan police firing case was transferred from Faridkot to Chandigarh for the safety of the accused cops. Sikh organisations objected, while a victim’s son will challenge these orders of the Punjab and Haryana high court .To shift this trial from the court of Faridkot’s additional sessions judge Ram Kumar Singla, a high court bench on Friday allowed a transfer petition that accused former senior superintendent of police Charanjit Sharma had moved in December 2019 citing security reasons. Sikh organisations demand justice for the Bargari sacrilege as well as the resultant Behbal Kalan police firing of two days later in which they lost two of their protesters — Krishan Bhagwan Singh and Gurjit Singh — at a village bus stand.That sacrilege and those two deaths had put Punjab on the boil and cost the Shiromani Akali Dal the subsequent state elections of February 2017. First the Congress and then the Aam Aadmi Party won the mandate to govern the state in the name of delivering justice, but now the justice seekers want an answer from AAP after two years. Earlier three cases of sacrilege were transferred from Faridkot to Chandigarh’s judicial magistrate for the safety of the accused who had pleaded with the Supreme Court to save their lives from elements within Punjab.On February 28, 2023, the bench of justices Aniruddha Bose and Sudhanshu Dhulia had allowed the transfer peti tion before the high court had stayed the trial over legal issues. Now only the Kotkapura police firing case remains in the Faridkot court, while the high court had ordered both Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan trials to run concurrently because of interlinked matters.Commenting on the latest case transfer, Behbal Kalan firing victim Krishan Bhagwan Singh’s son, Sukhraj Singh , claimed that: “This will delay the long-delayed justice even further, because the witnesses won’t like to travel all the way to Chandigarh. The accused are influential, and the witnesses inconvenienced, so we will challenge these orders.”About the transfer, case investigator Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh who later entered politics, said: “The govt machinery on the legal side has failed like an SIT (special investigation team) failed in the last three years. We saved this case in the high court by engaging private lawyers and secured orders favouring the trial on July 4, 2022, but now the witnesses might avoid travelling to Chandigarh.” Supreme Court’ senior lawyer H S Phoolka accused the Punjab govt of taking the case casually by letting it go to Chandigarh on the eve of a big election.","The trial in the October 2015 Behbal Kalan police firing case was transferred from Faridkot to Chandigarh for the safety of the accused cops.
