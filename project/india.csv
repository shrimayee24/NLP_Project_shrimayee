‘NDA Will Form Govt Again Under Nitish Kumar’s Leadership’: Bihar Dy CM Vijay Sinha Ahead Of Polls

NEW DELHI: NDA is banking on its reinforced alliance and the appeal of its welfare measures in regions going to polls in Bihar on Thursday to turn the tide in its favour in areas where the Mahagathbandhan (MGB) had edged past it in the last assembly election.In 2020, RJD-led opposition had won 61 of the 121 seats that go to polls in the first phase, against NDA's 59, performing strongly in Shahabad region and key districts such as Patna, Bhojpur, Saran and Siwan.Back then, Chirag Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party and Upendra Kushwaha, who headed RLSP, had fought separately, helping MGB gain ground in several constituencies, including Begusarai and Buxar. With both Paswan and Kushwaha back in NDA, alliance netas now believe their social coalition has been significantly strengthened. They are also counting on the impact of the govt's welfare initiatives - notably the Rs 10,000 cash transfer to over 1.3 crore women - to sway the voters.In 50 seats across Patna, Bhojpur, Buxar, Saran, Siwan and Begusarai, MGB had bagged 35 in 2020. CPI-ML Liberation, with its strong base among the poor across caste lines, had played a crucial role in MGB's success.A BJP neta said the alliance expects a major recovery in these districts as well as in Magadh and Shahabad regions, where polling is scheduled in the second phase on Nov 11.Also read: Key constituencies, top candidates in phase 1 of Bihar elections Home minister Amit Shah's claim that NDA's tally will rise from 125 seats in 2020 to over 160 stems from confidence of improving its performance in regions that favoured MGB earlier, he added.In 2020, Paswan had walked out of NDA and had dented the alliance's vote base, particularly in seats contested byJDU, while Kushwaha's support was tepid. The return of both netas and the rise of deputy CM Samrat Chaudhary within BJP have boosted the morale of the Kushwaha community, the second-largest OBC bloc after Yadavs, comprising about 4.2% of Bihar's population.In the first phase, JDU is contesting 57 seats, BJ and other allies six, while RJD is fighting more than 70, Congress 24 and CPI-ML 14, with VIP, CPI and CPM also in fray.","In 2020, RJD-led opposition had won 61 of the 121 seats that go to polls in the first phase, against NDA's 59.

Brazilian Model 'Sweety' Surfaces Online, Reacts to Rahul Gandhi's Electoral Fraud Charge in Haryana

NEW DELHI: Opposition parties on Wednesday accused BJP leaders of voting in more than one state's assembly polls, calling it “proof of vote theft.”The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), and Congress claimed that RSS ideologue Rakesh Sinha had voted in both the Delhi and Bihar elections.Sharing screenshots of Sinha’s posts, which showed him voting in the Delhi Assembly elections on 5 February 2025 and again in the Bihar Assembly elections on Thursday, AAP leader Saurabh Bharadwaj wrote on X: “Rakesh Sinha voted in the Delhi Assembly elections and again in the Bihar elections today. He teaches at Delhi University’s Motilal Nehru College, so how can he claim an address in Bihar? Do you think the BJP will reform if caught stealing? Not at all; they will continue to do it openly. Even today, fake monitoring continues at the AQI stations.”The opposition also alleged that BJP Delhi Purvanchal Morcha president Santosh Ojha and party worker Nagendra Kumar were among those who voted in both Delhi and Bihar.Rakesh Sinha dismissed the allegations, saying he had shifted his voter registration from Delhi to his village in Bihar, and warned that he would file a defamation suit against the accusationsTaking to X, Sinha said, “I never imagined politics could fall to such a low level. Those questioning the faith of people who respect the constitution should think a hundred times before speaking. My name was earlier in Delhi’s voter list, but since I have been active in Bihar politics, I got it transferred to my village Manserpur (Begusarai). Should I file a defamation case for this baseless accusation?” he asked.","Opposition parties accuse BJP leaders of voting in more than one state's assembly polls.

‘NDA Will Form Govt Again Under Nitish Kumar’s Leadership’: Bihar Dy CM Vijay Sinha Ahead Of Polls

Caste arithmetic in Gaura Bauram



Total electorate:

Estimated blocs:

VIP counts on consolidation in the end

A peculiar contest has emerged in Darbhanga’s Gaura Bauram constituency. Amid uncertainty and confusion during seat-sharing within the Mahagathbandhan, RJD had initially allotted the ticket to Afzal Ali Khan. Later, the seat was handed over to Mukesh Sahni’s VIP. Sahni then fielded his younger brother Santosh Sahni from here but Afzal Ali refused to withdraw. Treating this as indiscipline, RJD yesterday expelled Afzal Ali for six years with immediate effect.This sets up a potential split in the Muslim vote between Afzal Ali and Santosh Sahni, this could end up benefiting the BJP.BJP has fielded former IRS officer Sujeet Kumar Singh. His wife Swarna Singh had won from here in the previous election on VIP’s ticket, but later joined BJP. The seat has a sizeable Mallah population, the reason Mukesh Sahni had originally demanded it for himself but eventually nominated his younger brother.RJD insists that Santosh Sahni is the authorised Mahagathbandhan candidate. But on paper, Afzal Ali continues to remain the nominated nominee — something that could complicate Santosh’s prospects. Afzal Ali had lost by barely 7,000 votes the last time when he contested on RJD’s ticket.2.65 lakhMuslim 70k, Yadav 28k, Mallah 26k, Brahmin 33k, Vaishya 20k, Paswan 15k, other SC 25k.BJP’s Sujeet Kumar Singh is from the Rajput community, which is not numerically dominant here. However, he believes he can ride on the BJP’s core vote base plus Mahagathbandhan’s internal rebellion.Speaking to us, he claimed that barring Muslims, every caste group is voting for me. He also claimed a large chunk of Yadavs are backing him. Singh resigned from the IRS only a week before receiving the BJP ticket and believes his “education and clean image” will work as an added advantage.VIP spokesperson Dev Jyoti said within 24 hours of Afzal Ali’s expulsion, the “wind has swung” in VIP’s favour. He expressed confidence that Muslim voters, at the end of the day, will back the candidate best placed to defeat the BJP. He also said the backing of Lalu Prasad Yadav and Tejashwi Yadav is firmly with VIP here.However, some minority voters argue that since RJD had already issued the nomination earlier, Mukesh Sahni shouldn’t have disturbed the seat.","BJP has fielded former IRS officer Sujeet Kumar Singh.

PM Modi Warns of Cong, RJD's 'Dangerous Plot' to Alter Demographic Balance in Bihar Border Districts

The alliance contradiction in Bihar



Rahul’s line carried more than one message



The seat-sharing tussle exposed the balance of power



A familiar pattern across the INDIA bloc



Bihar exposes the reality again



NEW DELHI: Campaign heat in Bihar intensified this week after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi told a rally that Prime Minister Narendra Modi could “even dance for a vote.” The line was framed as a critique of spectacle-driven politics. But the timing gave it layered political weight.Just days earlier, Tejashwi Yadav had gone viral while dancing with local youth during an outreach event. And when Rahul linked PM Modi to the Ambani family, it was quickly noted that Tejashwi and the Lalu family had also attended the same wedding celebrations. Though the attack landed on PM Modi, the echo pierced into the INDIA bloc.Congress and RJD stand together today, but their power trajectories were shaped in opposition to each other. In the 1985 Bihar assembly election, Congress was the state’s dominant force, winning 196 of 324 seats with about 39 per cent vote share. The rise of Lalu Prasad Yadav in the post-Mandal decade reconfigured the social base with OBC consolidation, and new caste mobilisations shifted the centre of gravity. By 1990, Congress had fallen to 71 seats, and Lalu’s Janata Dal had come to power.When Lalu formed the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) in 1997, the shift became permanent. The party inherited Congress’s Yadav–Muslim core, organisational networks, and district-level nodes. By the 2020 election, RJD was the single largest party with 75 seats, while Congress was reduced to 19 seats, struggling to hold even pockets it once dominated.Rahul’s rhetoric targeted the BJP by casting Modi as performative and aligned with corporate power. But it also subtly differentiated Congress from its ally. That signalling was directed at urban, youth and minority constituencies where the Congress hopes to rebuild.In that frame, Tejashwi’s dance clip became a visual contrast, and the Ambani reference brushed against RJD because both leaderships were seen in the same frame of elite access. The outcome was political shading: an attack outward that cast a carefully measured shadow inward.Seat-sharing negotiations between RJD and Congress this season were prolonged and tense. RJD, backed by a larger cadre structure and broader voter base, argued for limiting Congress to a smaller quota than in 2020. Congress, citing national visibility and Rahul Gandhi’s campaign traction, pushed for expansion.The disagreement spilled into public view. Congress leaders accused RJD of treating it as dispensable. RJD leaders countered that Congress’s ground presence did not justify its demands. The standoff delayed candidate announcements, forced hurried swaps, and left smaller allies squeezed. The episode indicated that the alliance is driven by electoral compulsion, not ideological alignment.The contradiction on display in Bihar is part of a broader pattern across the INDIA bloc, where several of Congress’s current allies originally rose by eroding its own political base. In Uttar Pradesh, Mulayam Singh Yadav formed the Samajwadi Party in 1992 and consolidated the OBC and Muslim vote that had once anchored the Congress.In West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee broke away in 1998 to form the Trinamool Congress and, over time, absorbed Congress’s organisational networks in both urban centres and rural belts. In Maharashtra, Sharad Pawar’s split in 1999 and the creation of the NCP established a parallel power structure that drew away district leaders, cooperative institutions and vote blocs from the Congress.These parties did not simply emerge alongside Congress; they expanded by replacing it in the very regions where Congress had once been dominant.RJD seeks to retain primacy. Congress seeks to prove it is not a junior spectator. Rahul’s remark, therefore, worked on two planes: it targeted Modi’s persona politics while subtly reminding the Bihar electorate that Congress is still a political claimant, not an accessory. The INDIA bloc remains together. But in Bihar, as always, the real contest is not who stands on the same stage, but who stands taller.","Congress and RJD stand together today, but their power trajectories were shaped in opposition to each other.
