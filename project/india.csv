‘Country wants answer’: Rahul slams PM over J&K attacks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/country-wants-answer-rahul-slams-pm-over-jk-attacks/articleshow/110952349.cms,"NEW DELHI: Congress’ Rahul Gandhi lashed out at PM Narendra Modi on Wednesday, accusing govt of failing to arrest the perpetrators of terrorist attacks in J&K’s Reasi , Kathua , and Doda on June 9, coinciding with the Union Council of ministers’ oath-taking ceremony.

Rahul posted on X, “(PM) is so busy responding to congratulatory messages that he is unable to hear the cries of families of the pilgrims killed brutally in J&K. The country wants an answer. Why haven’t those behind terror attacks been caught in BJP’s regime.”

Congress’ media and publicity department chairman, Pawan Khera, stressed that while Union ministers were taking oath and heads of states were visiting the country, India suffered a horrific terror attack in Reasi when terrorists fired upon a bus carrying pilgrims from Shiv Khori Temple to Katra.

“Did the victims not deserve a word of sympathy from the self-proclaimed ‘divine’ PM? Modi is busy posting responses to congratulatory tweets by Pakistani leaders — Nawaz Sharif and Pak PM Shahbaz Sharif. Why has he maintained a stoic silence?”

Khera also alleged, “BJP’s hollow claims of the return of peace and normalcy in J&K have been thoroughly exposed. Their ‘Naya Kashmir’ policy is an abject failure as BJP doesn’t bother to fight polls in the valley.”","Congress’ Rahul Gandhi lashed out at PM Narendra Modi on Wednesday.

KOLKATA: Bengal BJP Wednesday trained its guns on the role of central forces during the 2024 Lok Sabha polls and alleged that “false voting“ had ruined the party’s chances in a number of constituencies.

“The central forces were deployed following EC’s order. But they did not have an independent role to play here. State police controlled them throughout the poll process,” Bengal leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari said.

BJP’s Ranaghat MP Jagannath Sarkar, too, raised questions on the central forces earlier in the day. “Where was the central force when Trinamool continued proxy and false voting ? I did not see them anywhere nearby. I have closely watched how they behaved on poll day,” Sarkar said.

Former Union minister Nishith Pramanik also alleged there had been false and proxy voting in nearly 8% of booths in Cooch Behar.

Adhikari said BJP had potential in a number of seats that they lost like Arambag, Midnapore, Bankura and Cooch Behar. “Proxy and false votes, this time, crossed a total of 25 lakh,” he claimed.

Why Pawan Kalyan is the 'right leader at right time' in Andhra politics,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-pawan-kalyan-is-the-right-leader-at-right-time-in-andhra-politics/articleshow/110943090.cms,"What Pawan Kalyan and his Jana Sena Party did right

NEW DELHI: Chandrababu Naidu , who took oath as Andhra Pradesh chief minister today, recently described Prime Minister Narendra Modi as the ""right leader at the right time."" However, when it comes to state politics, it is Naidu's ally and Janasena chief Pawan Kalyan who has emerged as the ""right leader at the right time"" after the just-concluded elections. After a decade of struggle and several ups and downs, the superstar-turned-politician has finally tasted electoral success. And that too with a near 100% strike rate. Pawan Kalyan's Jana Sena Party won both the Lok Sabha seats it contested from Andhra Pradesh and emerged as the second largest party in the state assembly winning 21 seats. Pawan Kalyan floated Jana Sena Party in 2014 and its first election was the 2019 though in 2014, the Jana Sena Party had supported the BJP and the TDP -- the power equation that worked for Andhra Pradesh in 2024.In 2019, Pawan Kalyan contested from two assembly constituencies -- Gajuwaka and Bhimavaram but lost both. In the face of a YSRCP wave at that time, the Jana Sena Party managed to get only 6% vote share. At that time Pawan Kalyan allied with the CPI, CPM and the Bahujan Samaj Party.In 2020, Pawan Kalyan announced an alliance with the BJP which took a formal shape in 2024 ahead of the election as TDP, JSP and the BJP joined hands. Chandrababu Naidu and Pawan Kalyan were the two leaders from Andhra Pradesh accompanying Narendra Modi when he went to file the Lok Sabha nomination from Varanasi.Pawan Kalyan did not switch sides but rejoined the NDA ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha election. In fact, he is believed to have played a crucial role in bridging the gap between the TDP and the Kapu caste -- as TDP is traditionally known as a party of the Kamma caste.Pawan Kalyan's official entry in politics was in 2007 when he worked for his brother Chiranjeevi's Praja Rajyam Party. From the beginning, he remained anti-Congress and so when Chiranjeevi merged his Praja Rajyam with the Congress, Pawan Kalyan distanced himself from politics. But he did not compromise on his ideology and after his hiatus floated the Jana Sena Party in 2014 with the slogan 'Congress hatao desh bachao'.In 2017, Pawan Kalyan pulled out of the NDA along with TDP accusing the BJP of cheating Andhra Pradesh on the promise of the special category status.Meanwhile, Pawan Kalyan worked on himself as a mass leader as his Jana Vani where he listened to people's grievances managed to get the pulse of the voters.",Pawan Kalyan's Jana Sena Party won both the Lok Sabha seats it contested from Andhra Pradesh.

But now that it's over, a video clip of an interaction between Union home minister Amit Shah and former Telangana governor Tamilisai Soundararajan has sparked speculation about potential rifts within the BJP 's state unit.The clip, which surfaced on social media, showed Tamilisai greeting Shah on stage as she walks past him. A second later, Shah calls her back and talks to her wagging his finger. The content of their conversation, however, remains unclear.The video has caught attention of many amid the speculation of rift between Tamil Nadu BJP chief K Annamalai and Tamilisai after the Lok Sabha debacle.BJP Tamil Nadu social media cell vice president Karthik Gopinath took to X and wrote: ""That looks like a strong admonishment from Amit shah ji to Tamilisai akka . But what could be the reason for this “public” warning? Unwarranted public comments?""Spokesperson of the DMK, Saravanan Annadurai said: ""What kind of politics is this? Is it polite to publicly reprimand a prominent female politician from Tamil Nadu? Amit Shah should know that everyone will see this. A very wrong example!""After BJP drew a blank in TN in the recently-concluded Lok Sabha elections, a section of party functionaries blamed Annamalai for the results. Tamilisai’s statements sparked fresh controversies as she opined that if BJP had teamed up with AIADMK, they would have won several seats.She also questioned postings given “to people with criminal history”. Though Annamalai was silent, his supporters clashed with supporters of Tamilisai on social media. Sources say that Annamalai, citing tug of war on social media, sought more control over the party.“Annamalai is unhappy about the fact that many party functionaries do not pay heed to him and urged leadership in Delhi to give him complete control of party reins to ensure a good performance in 2026 assembly election. We can expect a complete revamp of state BJP unit soon,” said another party senior, not willing to be named.Both Annamalai and Tamilisai lost as LS candidates.

Meet new Andhra minister Pawan Kalyan: The power star who brought 'aandhi' in politics,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/power-star-pawan-kalyan-deputy-chief-minister-the-actor-who-bought-aandhi-in-andhra-pradesh-politics/articleshow/110929843.cms,"The power star Pawan Kalyan

The political journey

NEW DELHI: A few days ago Prime Minister Narendra Modi introduced actor-politician Pawan Kalyan in a meeting of NDA MPs: ""Yeh Pawan nahi hai, aandhi hai (He is not a breeze, but a storm)."" Amid thunderous applause, this remark came as Kalyan's Jana Sena Party took the political arena by storm with a historic victory in the recently-concluded Lok Sabha elections 2024 and Andhra Pradesh assembly elections by winning all the seats it contested.And now the 'aandhi', Kalyan, has taken a new role on Wednesday as he took charge as minister of Andhra Pradesh in N Chandrababu Naidu cabinet.Pawan Kalyan, a prominent figure in the Telugu film industry , has left an indelible mark on Tollywood through his remarkable acting career and influential persona. Born on September 2, 1971, in Bapatla, Andhra Pradesh, Pawan Kalyan embarked on his journey in the entertainment world with his debut film ""Akkada Ammayi Ikkada Abbayi"" in 1996. Since then, he has captivated audiences with his charismatic screen presence and versatile performances.Pawan Kalyan's rise to stardom can be attributed to his ability to connect with the masses through his films. He has portrayed a wide range of characters, from the rebellious youth in ""Thammudu"" to the vigilante in ""Gabbar Singh."" His films often tackle social issues and showcase his strong convictions, earning him a loyal fan base that extends beyond the boundaries of the film industry.Beyond his acting prowess, Pawan Kalyan is also known for his philanthropic endeavors and political activism.The actor , who has earned the moniker 'Power Star' due to his dynamic performances in action movies, made his foray into the political arena in 2008. He joined forces with his brother Chiranjeevi's political party, Praja Rajyam Party (PRP).Despite the initial enthusiasm and support, the PRP failed to make a significant impact on the political landscape. The party's journey was short-lived, and it ultimately merged with the Congress party. This move marked the end of Pawan Kalyan's first political venture.In 2014, Kalyan established his own political party, JSP, but the party did not participate in the elections that year. Instead, he supported the TDP-BJP alliance, which came to power.The JSP contested its first assembly and Lok Sabha elections in Andhra Pradesh in 2019 independently. The party suffered a humiliating defeat, with Kalyan himself losing in both Assembly constituencies he contested – Gajuwaka of Visakhapatnam and Bhimavaram of West Godavari. The party managed to win only one seat, Razole assembly constituency (SC-reserved), but the MLA later defected to the YSR Congress party.Despite the electoral setback, Kalyan remained determined. He raised his voice against the ruling YSRCP and chief minister Jagan Mohan Reddy on various issues.In the latter half of 2022, Kalyan initiated 'Jana Vani', a series of small public meetings to listen to people's grievances. ""He was the only politician who worked to fight for public issues"" despite losing the 2019 elections, as noted by Businessline.When the YSRCP government cracked down on one such meeting in Visakhapatnam and arrested JSP cadres, it helped bring TDP chief Naidu and Pawan Kalyan back together.Kalyan also persistently reached out to BJP leaders, including Amit Shah and JP Nadda, even when he did not receive a warm response.Finally, Kalyan succeeded in forming an alliance among TDP, JSP, and BJP, which announced a pre-poll alliance in March.(With agency inputs)","Pawan Kalyan, a prominent figure in the Telugu film industry, has left an indelible mark on Tollywood through his remarkable acting career and influential persona.

"After Mohan Bhagwat's Manipur message, RSS-linked magazine says BJP workers were 'overconfident', some leaders 'happy in their bubble'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-mohan-bhagwats-manipur-message-rss-linked-magazine-says-bjp-workers-were-overconfident-some-leaders-happy-in-their-bubble/articleshow/110910409.cms,"Mohan Bhagwat's message

NEW DELHI: In the last 10 years, BJP's top leadership has come under several scathing attacks from the opposition ranks. But results of the just-concluded Lok Sabha elections seems to have opened a new worrying front for the saffron party, that failed to win a majority on its own despite Prime Minister Modi's strong ""abki baar, 400 paar pitch.""A day after RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat 's strong message on the ""neglect of Manipur for one year"" and ""lack of decorum"" during campaigning, an article in a magazine linked to the RSS says the BJP workers were overconfident and some party workers were happy in their ""bubble"" enjoying the glow of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's aura but not listening to the voices on the streets.The article in the latest issue of ""Organiser"" magazine also noted that though the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) is not a ""field force"" of the BJP, the party leaders and workers did not reach out to its 'swayamsevaks' (volunteers) seeking their cooperation in electoral work.Neglect of older dedicated workers who worked without the urge for recognition by the new age social media-aided selfie powered activists was also evident in the poll results, said the article written by Ratan Sharda who is a life-long member of the RSS.Sharda noted that the idea that Modi was fighting on all 543 Lok Sabha seats had “a limited value”. “This idea became self-defeating when the candidates were changed, imposed at the cost of local leaders and defectors given more importance. Sacrificing even well performing parliamentarians to accommodate late comers hurt. It is estimated that around 25 percent of candidates were seasonal migrants,” he said.“This happened despite the shocking experience of 30 per cent rebels in the last Himachal Pradesh elections that resulted in defeat of the BJP. Local issues, track record of the candidate does matter, one can see. Disinterest of local BJP workers was due to this factor too,” he added.Sharda, who has authored many books on the RSS, cited the case of Maharashtra to flag ""unnecessary politicking"" as one of the many reasons behind the BJP's underperformance in the Lok Sabha polls. The BJP fared very badly in the state winning just 9 Lok Sabha seats.""Maharashtra is a prime example of unnecessary politicking and avoidable manipulations. NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar joined BJP though BJP and split SS (Shiv Sena) had a comfortable majority. Sharad Pawar would have faded away in two-three years as NCP would have lost energy with infighting between cousins,"" he said.""Why was this ill-advised step taken? BJP supporters were hurt because they had fought against this Congress ideology for years and were persecuted. In a single stroke, BJP reduced its brand value. After years of struggle to become numero uno in Maharashtra, it became just another political party without any difference,"" he added.Sharda also pointed at the induction of some Congressmen into BJP, who had ""actively promoted"" the bogey of saffron terror and persecuted Hindus and also called 26/11 'RSS ki sazish' and branded RSS as a terrorist organisation. ""This showed the BJP ""in poor light"" and also hurt the RSS sympathisers ""immensely"","" he wrote in the article.The life-long RSS member also took a dig at the culture of posting selfies, which has been actively used to mobilise support by BJP's top leadership.""Showing off is more important by posting selfies with a multiplier effect is the new norm. If BJP volunteers don't reach out to RSS, they have to answer why they thought it was not required?"" he said.""To seek (RSS) swayamsevaks' cooperation in electoral work, BJP workers, local leaders need to reach out to their ideological allies. Did they? My experience and interaction tells me, they did not,"" Sharda said.""Was it lethargy, overconfidence, sense of comfort that 'Ayega to Modi hi, Abki bar 400 plus'? I do not know,"" he said.On Monday, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat had expressed concern over peace eluding Manipur even after one year and said the situation in the strife-torn north eastern state must be considered with priority.""The situation in Manipur will have to be considered with priority. There is need to get over election rhetoric and focus on problems facing the nation,"" the RSS chief asserted. The unrest either got triggered or was triggered, but Manipur is burning and people are facing its extreme heat, the RSS chief had said.The RSS chief stressed the need for consensus between the ruling side and the opposition so that work for common good (of the masses) can be carried out. Polls are to gain majority and it is a competition and not war, Bhagwat pointed out. Political parties and leaders bad-mouthing each other are not taking into account that these may cause rifts among communities, he said and lamented that even the RSS was being dragged into it without any reason. There are always two sides in an election but there should be dignity about not resorting to lies to win, the RSS chief asserted.Manipur plunged into violence between the Meitei and Kuki communities in May last year. Since then some 200 people have been killed, while thousands have been displaced following large scale arson that has gutted homes and government buildings. While Amit Shah and other senior ministers have visited the state several times, Prime Minister Modi has not visited Manipur ignoring the demands of several opposition leaders.(With inputs from agencies)","The article in ""Organiser"" magazine says the BJP workers were overconfident and some party workers were happy in their ""bubble"" The article was written by Ratan Sharda who is a life-long member of the RSS.

Narendra Modi Takes Oath As India's Prime Minister For Historic Third Consecutive Term

First session

NEW DELHI: A day after taking oath of office for a historic third consecutive term , Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday assigned portfolios to his 71 council of ministers .The new Union Cabinet held its first meeting at the PM's residence in the evening following which the full list of portfolios was released.Signalling continuity, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday retained four of his high-profile ministers Amit Shah, Rajnath Singh, Nirmala Sitharaman and S Jaishankar of Home, Defence, Finance and External Affairs respectively in his new government.The four ministers in charge of these portfolios make up the crucial Cabinet Committee on Security headed by the prime minister.Among new entrants to the Union Cabinet, former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has got Agriculture and Rural Development Ministries, while BJP president J P Nadda has returned to the Health Ministry, a portfolio he had held in the Modi government's first term before he took charge of the ruling BJP first as working president in 2019 and then as the full-fledged president in 2020.Among the five members of the BJP's allies in the Union Cabinet, JD(Secular)'s H D Kumaraswamy has got Heavy Industries, and Steel ministries, Jitan Ram Manjhi (HAM-Secular) has Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Ministry, and Lalan Singh (Janata Dal-United) Panchayati Raj, Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying Ministries.TDP's K Rammohan Naidu has got the Civil Aviation Ministry and LJP (Ram Vilas) leader Chirag Paswan has been allocated the Food Processing Industries Ministry.Among Ministers of State with Independent Charge, BJP ally and RLD leader Jayant Chaudhary has been allocated Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Ministry and Shiv Sena leader Jadhav Prataprao Ganpatrao will handle Ayush Ministry.The PM Modi 3.0 council of ministers include representation from all corners of the country as well as social groups.It has 27 ministers from Other Backward Classes, 10 from Scheduled Castes, 5 from Scheduled Tribes and 5 from minorities.A record 18 senior ministers will be heading ministries.Modi Cabinet 3.0 includes 43 ministers who have served 3 terms or higher in Parliament, with 39 having been ministers in central government before. The list includes multiple former chief ministers and 34 ministers who have served in state legislatures and 23 having worked as ministers in states.There are also 33 first-timers in the ranks. Seven first-time ministers in the Modi government belong to the allies: TDP's K Rammohan Naidu and Chandrasekhar Pemmasani; JDU's Lalan Singh and Ram Nath Thakur, RLD's Jayant Chaudhary, LJP's Chirag Paswan and HD Kumaraswamy of the JD(S).The new faces also include Suresh Gopi, the actor-turned-politician who scripted history by becoming the first BJP MP from Kerala.BJP's NDA partners have got five cabinet ministerial berths this time, as against none in the outgoing government, given the party's dependence on allies for a majority in the Lok Sabha. While the outgoing council of ministers had two ministers of state from BJP's allies -- Anupriya Patel of the Apna Dal (S) and Ramdas Athawale of the RPI(A) -- this time, there are two ministers of states with independent charge and four ministers of state (MoS).As per the Constitution of India, the total strength of the council of ministers cannot exceed 15% of the total number of Lok Sabha MPs.The strength of the 18th Lok Sabha is 543 members and hence the council of ministers cannot be more than 81.The 2024 Lok Sabha election results were announced by the Election Commission of India on June 4, the BJP won 240 seats and the Congress 99 seats. BJP had won 303 seats in the 2019 general elections and 282 seats in the 2014 general elections.The NDA's tally is 293 seats -- well above the majority mark of 272 -- and opposition INDIA bloc 234.As per media reports citing sources, the first session of the 18th Lok Sabha will begin from June 18 with President Droupadi Murmu expected to address a joint sitting of both Houses on June 21.The MPs in the Lower House are expected to take oaths on June 18-19, following which the Speaker will be elected on June 20.","Narendra Modi takes oath of office for third consecutive term as Prime Minister of India on Monday. No change in CCS composition but four high-profile ministers are replaced. Prime Minister retains four of his high- profile ministers, Rajnath Singh, Nath Singh and Arjun Ram Meghwal. RPI(A) leader Athawale Ramdas Bandu is replaced by RLD chief Jayant Chaudhary.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110869916,imgsize-848760,width-400,resizemode-4/110869916.jpg"
