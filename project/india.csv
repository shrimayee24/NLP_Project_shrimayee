Diversion of SC/ST funds for Congress' Karnataka pledges 'injustice': BJP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/diversion-of-sc/st-funds-for-congress-karnataka-pledges-injustice-bjp/articleshow/111590430.cms,"NEW DELHI: BJP continued to mount pressure on Karnataka govt over the alleged diversion of SC/ST funds for 'five guarantees ' Congress had promised in the run-up to the 2023 assembly polls.

Govt justified the decision saying the guarantees also cover members of SC and ST communities and that it would cover the cost of the schemes for SC and ST beneficiaries.Earlier, the Karnataka BJP unit had accused the Siddaramaiah-led Congress govt of utilising Rs 14,800-crore funds meant for the five guarantees.","BJP mounts pressure on Karnataka govt over alleged diversion of SC/ST funds for 'five guarantees' Congress had promised in the run-up to the 2023 assembly polls.

His party JMM's Champai Soren succeeded him as CM, only to resign on grant of bail to Soren to pave the way for the latter to become CM again.On May 22, the apex court had refused to entertain Soren's plea challenging the validity of his arrest by ED in the land scam case. He had argued that land grab was not a predicate office under Prevention of Money Laundering Act and that the land alleged to have been forcibly taken by him was never in his name.The refusal to admit Soren's appeal was also for the fact that a trial court had already taken cognisance of a chargesheet filed against him in the land grab case. The trial court had also rejected his regular bail plea. Soren's challenge to his arrest was rejected by Jharkhand high court on May 3, after which he had approached the Supreme Court."," ED moved SC on Monday challenging Jharkhand HC's decision to grant bail to Hemant Soren.

He has not yet become the leader of the opposition properly. He says we (the India bloc) defeated the Ram Janmabhoomi movement . Rahul ji, Ram is our existence, our ideal, our life, our God, and Ram is the identity of India.""Gandhi's comments included a claim that by defeating the BJP in Ayodhya , the INDIA bloc had undermined the Ram Mandir movement initiated by BJP veteran L K Advani. Chouhan countered this assertion, emphasizing Ram's integral role in India's identity.""This movement has thrown the Congress out of power many times and paved the way for the construction of a divine and grand temple, but Rahul Gandhi only lies,"" Chouhan said.He further accused Gandhi of fabricating information about various issues, including Agniveer martyrs and the Minimum Support Price (MSP).""He (Rahul) knows nothing else other than lying and spreading confusion.

Gujarati-origin woman scripts Tories’ only gain; Shivani Raja broke Labour’s grip on Leicester East,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/gujarati-origin-woman-scripts-tories-only-gain/articleshow/111560030.cms,"TOI

LONDON: There was a silver lining on an otherwise dark night for the Tories on Thursday. Gujarati-origin businesswoman Shivani Raja (29) won Leicester East -- the only Conservative gain of the night. Raja won with 14,526 votes, beating Labour ’s Rajesh Agrawal, former deputy mayor of London who came second with 10,100.Leicester East had been held by Labour since 1987.The area was rocked by riots in 2022, something Raja referred to after her triumph.Padma Shri awardee and Conservative MP Bob Blackman bucked the national trend and increased his majority in Harrow East from 8,170 to 11,860, beating his Indian-origin Labour opponent Primesh Patel. Harrow East has a large Indian diaspora, especially from Gujarat and south India. Many of them helped with Blackman’s campaign. Blackman now plans to throw his hat in the ring to be the chairman of the 1922 committee, the committee of backbench Tory MPs which organises the process to choose the next Conservative party leader.Raja was born in Leicester. Her mother moved to the UK from Rajkot and her father, a Gujarati, moved from Kenya in the 1970s. She works in the family property construction and hospitality business. Raja toldthat voters felt very disenfranchised and backed her as she was local, unlike some other candidates who had been “parachuted in”.“They had lost faith in politicians as previous MPs had not really stood for the people. There was no one standing that was relatable and people saw me as a breath of fresh air. They were also disappointed that the previous MP did not stand up for Leicester during the riots and immediately blamed Hindus before speaking to anyone,” Raja said.Keith Vaz first won Leicester East in 1987. Claudia Webbe, who won the seat in 2019 for Labour but then got expelled from the party over a criminal conviction and stood as an independent, got 5,532 votes. Vaz, who stood for One Leicester, got 3,681 votes.As for Blackman, he has the task cut for him. If elected as chairman of the 1922 committee, he will organise the leadership contest to replace Rishi Sunak, who bowed out as PM after last week’s election results.The panel’s former chairman, Graham Brady, stood down at this election. Blackman told the Daily Telegraph: “I’ve been around since 1992. I’ve been through all the seminal events with Theresa May, Boris, Liz Truss and the election of Rishi.” He said the Conservatives needed a “chairman with the authority to be able to get the party together to be able to hear every view.”Co-chair of Conservative Friends of India Ameet Jogia, a former No.10 political advisor and political aide to Lord Popat, failed to win Hendon by just 15 seats — the lowest margin in the country. He is now taking legal advice about launching a possible judicial review against Barnet council for not sending postal ballots to people on time.Had Jogia, a Harrow-born Girnari Soni whose parents moved to the UK from Tanzania, been elected, he would have become the first member of the Soni community in the House of Commons. Thousands of voters in 120 constituencies are thought to have been impacted by delayed and missing postal ballots. Jogia told The Telegraph he personally knows constituents would have voted for him but their postal votes never arrived. “In my case this would have made a difference.”","Gujarati-origin businesswoman Shivani Raja (29) won Leicester East -- the only Conservative gain of the night.
