Protestors demand to seal mosque

CM Sukhu to set up panel

NEW DELHI: Tension prevailed in Himachal Pradesh 's Sanjauli as protestors hit the roads on Wednesday against the alleged illegal construction of a mosque.Hindu groups, who had called for a bandh, came out on streets along with the people in the hill state as they were irked by the Shimla Municipal Corporation's slow pace in deciding the legality of the mosque's construction -- which has been pending since 2010.The case has been heard nearly 45 times, but the final decision on the matter is yet to come.The protest turned ugly when the agitators clashed with the police and removed barricades to enter the Dhalli tunnel that leads to the Sanjauli area, where the mosque stands. The cops pushed against the protesting crowds by resorting to lathi-charge and also used water cannons to disperse the gatherings.Himachal Pradesh minister Vikramaditya Singh , to persuade the enraged protestors, assured action once the decision on the matter comes and said the mosque ""will be demolished if it is found to be illegal""""This matter has been pending for a long period. As far as the construction of illegal buildings is concerned, the government has taken cognisance of it. I have also strongly said in the assembly that as soon as the decision comes on this within the ambit of law action will be taken, it will be demolished if it is found to be illegal,"" Singh said.The minister said the government will ""move ahead with the process of law"" and that an ""atmosphere of peace should prevail in Himachal Pradesh"".Several protesters complained that the government first denied them permission to hold a peaceful demonstration and now was arresting them.Vijay Sharma, one of the demonstration's leaders told news agency PTI that the police lathi-charge on the protesters led to the volatile atmosphere in the area.""We demand that the structure be sealed till the hearing is concluded, all outsiders coming to the state be registered and a vendor's policy formulated on a population basis with 95 per cent licence to Hindus,"" Sharma said.Many women also joined the protest and recited Hanuman Chalisa at Dhalli before breaking the barricades.Sunita, who was among the protesters, claimed police lathi-charged children as well.""We are neither from the Congress nor from the BJP, we are Hindus and want these street vendors out,"" she told PTI.Janvi, a student of Class 6 of SPM Public School in Sanjauli, the students were scared as they were stuck in the school due to the protest.""We were allowed to leave when our parents came to collect us,"" she added.Amid the protests against the illegal construction of the mosque, Himachal Pradesh chief minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu, on September 9, assured that his government will constitute a committee to frame a street vendors' policy and to issue licences only after their verification.The CM, on the concluding day of the 11-day monsoon session of the Himachal assembly, said either a cabinet sub-committee or a vidhan sabha committee will be constituted to address this issue since Congress and BJP were equally responsible for maintaining communal harmony in the state.He said the state had a history of various communities co-existing peacefully, but action will be taken as per law in case of any illegal activity.","Hindu groups, who had called for a bandh, came out on streets along with the people in the hill state.

"Omar fighting for chair, I’m fighting for people of Kashmir, says Engineer Rashid after walking out of Tihar",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/omar-fighting-for-chair-im-fighting-for-people-of-kashmir-says-engineer-rashid-after-walking-out-of-tihar/articleshow/113270361.cms,"NEW DELHI/SRINAGAR: Baramulla MP Sheikh Abdul Rashid , popularly known as Engineer Rashid , walked out of Tihar jail a day after he was granted interim bail by a Delhi court to campaign for the J&K assembly elections, even as his plea for regular bail was on Wednesday deferred to Oct 5.Rashid, who heads the Awami Ittehad Party (AIP), has been in prison since 2019 under UAPA in a 2017 terror funding case.The court of additional sessions judge Chander Jit Singh had granted interim bail to Rashid on several conditions, which included not speaking to the media about the case, speaking to the investigation officer on alternate days via video-conference, and not tampering with evidence or influencing witnesses.His release to participate in the poll campaign seems to have rattled mainstream parties in Kashmir , even as Rashid targeted both BJP and National Conference (NC) after coming out of prison. Talking to reporters, he vowed to fight against PM Narendra Modi ’s “narrative of naya Kashmir”, and took a dig at NC vice-president Omar Abdullah, saying he was only concerned about coming to power.“PM Modi’s narrative of ‘naya Kashmir’ has miserably failed. That was proved by the people of my constituency on June 4. The vote for me was actually a referendum against Modi’s narrative… I will fight against his narrative of ‘naya Kashmir’ and for the peaceful resolution of the Kashmir issue till my last breath,” he said.Replying to a question about Omar, Engineer Rashid said Omar was fighting for the chair while his fight “is for my people”. “My fight is much bigger than what Omar Abdullah is fighting for. There is a difference between spending five years in London and spending this time in Tihar jail, where prisoners crave for medical attention,” said the Baramulla MP, who had defeated Omar in the parliamentary polls by over two lakh votes.Rashid said he would go to the people to unite them, and not to divide them. “If that’s a crime, I am proud to commit this crime again and again. If I will have to spend my entire life in Tihar for this crime, I am ready,” he said. “I won’t exploit my people. Let youth study, businessmen do business; leave politics to us.”BJP’s election in-charge for J&K, Ram Madhav, strongly responded to Rashid’s anti-Modi rhetoric. “This rank separatist, in jail for the last 5 years under UAPA for indulging in anti-India activities, is out on bail to further vitiate Valley politics. Look at the language… anti-Modi rants, restoring Article 370 , freeing terrorists from jails… no different from what Omar or Mehbooba or even others… — the Gupkar Gang — are saying. He wants to defeat Modi’s dream of ‘naya Kashmir’. We accept the challenge. Naya Kashmir’s march will go on unrelentingly,” Madhav said in a post on X.Reacting to Er Rashid’s release, Omar and PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti insinuated that he and his party were being propelled by BJP to weaken the mainstream parties in Kashmir.Talking to reporters in Kupwara, Omar said, “When Arvind Kejriwal was allowed to campaign, they (BJP) opposed the move and questioned how a person could be released from jail for electioneering, but today they welcomed the release of Er Rashid.”Mehbooba said Rashid’s release raised doubts, and wondered how AIP seemed to have no dearth of money even when its leader was behind the bars, while her party was struggling to fund campaign rallies. “I am surprised to see AIP carrying out huge rallies in vehicles. Who is funding AIP?” she asked, while speaking to reporters in Shopian.","Sheikh Abdul Rashid walked out of Tihar jail a day after he was granted interim bail by a Delhi court.

He went on to say, ""The fight is about whether a Sikh is going to be allowed to wear his turban in India, or a kada. Or if, as a Sikh, he will be able to go to a gurdwara. That's what the fight is about.

He appealed to the people of Julana to make Vinesh Phogat win by a huge margin and said that the whole country would be watching the results of Haryana , especially the Julana assembly.He appealed to the people of Julana that the result here should be such that it echoes all over the world and people say that Julana has done justice. He said that Vinesh Phogat has worked hard and struggled in life. “It is not easy for any sportsperson to clash with the government and the system,” he said.“When all the players of the world were practicing on the mat, Vinesh Phogat was fighting to get justice for the sportswomen and put her career at stake to get justice for the daughters. When the BJP called the sportswomen daughters traitors, she gave a befitting reply to the BJP in the Olympics, by making the whole world bow down,” he added.On this occasion, Sonipat MP Pandit Satpal Brahmachari said that the hard work of every worker of Sonipat Lok Sabha constituency will pay off and Vinesh Phogat will win by a huge margin from Julana assembly.Deepender Hooda said the public mood in Haryana has shifted. “The atmosphere in favor of Congress in Haryana can be gauged from the fact that only one voice is coming from every corner of the state, that BJP government is going, Congress government is coming,” he stated.He told that during the Congress government the Hooda government built Chaudhary Ranbir Singh University in Jind, even when there was not a single MLA from Jind Lok Sabha from Congress. “We got the railway line approved here, got many development works done including school, college, hospital, four-lane highway. But the 10-year BJP government did not do any development work, on the contrary, this government insulted every section. Farmers, youth, sarpanch, players, Anganwadi, Asha workers, youth who raised voice against Agneepath were beaten up,” he noted.He said that the BJP government ruined Haryana in 10 years. “The state which was number 1 in development, prosperity, law and order has today become number 1 in unemployment, drug addiction, crime, corruption and inflation. BJP entangled people in portals, family ID, property ID and youth in CET, temporary recruitment. BJP government ate up all permanent recruitment and also brought temporary recruitment in the Army.
