‘Bihar’s New MY Formula Is Mahila & Youth’: PM Modi Targets RJD-Congress After NDA’s Landslide Win

NEW DELHI: The smooth and peaceful conduct of Bihar polls with the highest turnout ever, particularly after the first special intensive revision (SIR) of its electoral roll in over two decades, is set to boost the confidence of Election Commission as it goes about Phase 2 of SIR across a dozen states and Union territories, including those due for assembly polls next.The overwhelming participation of electors first in SIR and then in Bihar polls is seen as a clear indication that the ‘vote chori’ campaign of the Opposition, led by the Congress and amplified by Rahul Gandhi through his ‘vote adhikar’ yatra in the state, press conferences and even personal attacks against the chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar, did not find resonance with the public. The assessment is reinforced by the Congress's modest six-seat tally.Even the Supreme Court had refused to entertain the opposition parties’ and activists’ pleas to stay and quash SIR in Bihar, based on their fear that it would disenfranchise electors from weaker sections and minorities. Of course, the high participation of these very sections in the Bihar poll, has demolished their argument. Prime Minister Narendra Modi , in his victory speech on Friday, said the high voting in Bihar, particularly by the weaker sections, is a big achievement of the EC, as is the elimination of repolls that were synonymous with elections during the ‘jungle raj’ era.He recalled how voting in Naxalism-hit polling stations was earlier wound up at 3 PM over security concerns. This time, he said, electors voted overwhelmingly and fearlessly, erasing old memories of ballot boxes being looted.“I congratulate the EC, poll-related officers, security forces and electors for this,” said Modi. Importantly, he underlined that the electors of Bihar, particularly the youth, had shown that they take SIR with utmost seriousness. “For purity of democracy, every vote matters,” he said while exhorting the party apparatus at the polling station level to contribute 100% to SIR in other places.Speaking to TOI, chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar said: “The zero appeals against the final electoral roll of Bihar, not a single request for repoll from the 2,616 candidates or 12 recognised parties and the highest polling since Bihar’s first election in 1951, show the precision and commitment with which EC and its ground machinery have worked to deliver a free, fair and peaceful election. This, for EC, is the biggest validation”.Kumar was personally targeted in comments by Rahul Gandhi and AI-generated campaigns on Congress’s social media handles, both over SIR and alleged roll irregularities in long-gone elections in Karnataka, Maharashtra and Haryana. Yet, displaying tenacity, EC countered each attack with facts and cited the relevant provisions of law validating its actions and directions. Transparency at each stage of SIR -- enumeration, claims and objections and their disposal -- with daily bulletins and fact-checks ensured a direct line with the electors who willingly participated in SIR and ensured that all deadlines were met.","The smooth and peaceful conduct of Bihar polls with the highest turnout ever is set to boost the confidence of Election Commission. The overwhelming participation of electors first in SIR and then in Bihar polls is seen as a clear indication that the ‘vote chori’ campaign of the Opposition, led by the Congress, did not find resonance with the public.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125340542,imgsize-989790,width-400,resizemode-4/pm-modi-ani.jpg"

Bihar election 2025: How BJP's numbers gain cushions it against another Nitish deal with MGB,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-election-2025-how-bjps-numbers-gain-cushions-it-against-another-nitish-deal-with-mgb/articleshow/125340443.cms,"Six Ways Nitish Kumar Proved 'Tiger Abhi Zinda Hai' As NDA Registers Big Win in Bihar Assembly Polls

NEW DELHI: NDA's massive win in Bihar has placed BJP in a sweet spot as seat shares of different parties, across the political spectrum, have virtually cushioned it against political exigencies which have bedevilled it in the past.Though BJP and JDU have bonded well since CM Nitish Kumar returned to NDA in Jan 2024 and has vowed to never join hands with RJD again, the decimation of Lalu Prasad's party has ensured any such future prospect is hardly a guarantee for a new govt.RJD's tally of 25, six of Congress and JDU's 85 MLAs together falls short of the majority mark of 122 - a feat that was achievable after the 2020 elections when Nitish decided to dump BJP.A consolidation of the entire Mahagathbandhan with JDU will reach the 120 mark and will require the support of AIMIM's five MLAs to cross the magic number, an uncertain scenario as it includes parties with one or two MLAs and six of Congress, which has a history of legislators breaking ranks in the state.With BJP emerging as the single-largest party for the first time in Bihar after an assembly poll - it had achieved the distinction in the outgoing assembly after bypolls and joining by MLAs of Vikassheel Insaan Party - with 89 seats, the party can hope to spurn any bid to oust him from power, a fate it has suffered twice as Nitish switched between alliances.While the Chirag Paswan-led LJP(RV), which has won 19 seats, has been firmly by BJP's side, two other NDA partners, Jitan Ram Manjhi's HAM and Upendra Kushwaha's Rashtriya Lok Morcham, have increasingly hewed closer to BJP even though both were once in JDU.HAM and RLM have won five and four seats, respectively. BJP with its three other allies outside JDU will have the support 117 MLAs and depend upon support from six more lawmakers to get a majority, if such an eventuality arises.The numbers have also ensured that no non-JDU ally is in a position to push BJP, or is left with much leverage to get its demand met.Paswan in the past has at times flexed muscle in seat-sharing talks or tried to take a line different from BJP on key political issues, a tactic often resented by the BJP brass.Manjhi like Paswan has always been vocal in endorsing PM Narendra Modi but is seen a mercurial ally. Both are also cabinet ministers at the Centre. With Lok Sabha elections due in 2029 and assembly polls over, it is unlikely that any of these allies will venture to disturb the governing coalition.There is a view that BJP may also induct Kushwaha as a minister in the central govt or make his wife, who has won as an MLA, a minister in the state govt to ensure that all its allies are suitable rewarded.BJD had hit a similar enviable zone following the Maharashtra assembly polls where NDA received a sweeping mandate as it has now in Bihar. In the 288-member House, BJP won 132 seats, reducing its dependability on allies significantly. It ensured its decision to replace Sena politician Eknath Shinde with its neta Devendra Fadnavis as CM was executed without any major hiccup.In Bihar, BJP has asserted NDA was fighting the election under Nitish's leadership and that there was no vacancy for the top post, while stopping short of declaring himself as its chief ministerial face. However, his continuation is seen as most likely.","NDA's massive win in Bihar has placed BJP in a sweet spot as seat shares of different parties, across the political spectrum, have virtually cushioned it.

NEW DELHI: Leading BJP's celebrations over the party's impressive performance in Bihar, PM Narendra Modi on Friday said the state's people have given a befitting reply to the ""divisive M-Y (Muslim-Yadav)"" with another 'M-Y' (Mahila-Youth), a constructive and positive combine, to thwart the return of ""Jungle-Raj"".""This victory has given a new positive meaning to the 'M-Y', that is 'Mahila and Youth'. Bihar has the highest youth population belonging to all castes and religions. Their wishes, aspirations and dreams have destroyed the communal 'M-Y' formula of 'Jungle Raj',"" Modi said in his address to BJP workers in victory celebrations at the party headquarters here.Waving a ""gamcha"" to greet BJP workers, Modi chanted 'Chhathi Maiya ki Jai' and also used the Bhojpuri lingo 'garda uda diya', meaning the people of Bihar, with this massive victory and their unshakable confidence, have taken the state by storm.Doubling down the attack on Congress, the PM coined a new term, 'MMC' for the opposition party, saying it has become ""Muslim League Maoist Congress"", a remark reflecting concerns within Congress too as Sonia Gandhi, after the 2014 Lok Sabha poll loss, had attributed her party's defeat for being identified as ""pro-Muslim"". ""Today's Congress has become a Muslim League Maoist Congress (MMC), its entire agenda is run only on this,"" Modi said.The PM said Congress is headed for another split as a large section of the party is unhappy with the ""agenda"" of ""Namdaar"" (Rahul Gandhi), and they are set to part ways. He said even Congress's allies are beginning to understand that Congress is drowning everyone in its negative politics. ""That is why, during the Bihar elections, I said that the 'naamdar' of Congress is practising to drown himself and others in the Bihar elections by taking a dip in the pond,"" he said.Modi hailed the leadership of CM Nitish Kumar and the contribution of all NDA leaders, including Chirag Paswan, Jitan Ram Manjhi and Upendra Kushwaha.","Bihar's people have given a befitting reply to the ""divisive M-Y (Muslim- Yadav),"" PM Narendra Modi said.

Bihar Exit Polls 2025: Poll of Polls Show NDA Poised For Majority, MGB Trails, No Impact of JSP

NEW DELHI: In Lakhisarai, BJP’s Vijay Kumar Sinha has secured victory with 1,22,408 votes, defeating INC’s Amaresh Kumar, who finished with 97,468 votes, while Jan Suraaj’s Suraj Kumar trailed behind with 8,722 votes.Lakhisarai Assembly constituency, situated in Lakhisarai district, is among Bihar’s 243 seats and falls under the Munger Lok Sabha constituency. Classified as a General seat, it has long been a battleground between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and rival opposition groups. Bihar's deputy CM and BJP's Vijay Kumar Sinha is the sitting MLA from here.In the 2020 Assembly polls, BJP’s Vijay Kumar Sinha retained the seat, polling 74,212 votes (38.2 per cent). He defeated Congress candidate Amaresh Kumar, who received 63,729 votes (32.8 per cent), by a margin of 10,483. Independent contenders also made their presence felt — Sujeet Kumar secured 11,570 votes, while Fulena Singh got 10,938. Out of 3,68,106 registered electors, 1,94,289 votes were declared valid.Sinha had earlier won in 2015 as well, bagging 75,901 votes (40.8 per cent) against JD(U)’s Ramanand Mandal, who garnered 69,345 votes (37.3 per cent), marking a narrow margin of 6,556.The constituency’s voting history reflects tight contests, though the BJP has managed to hold the seat for consecutive terms.Polling has concluded and the fate of the candidates is now sealed in the electronic voting machines.A poll of polls released on Tuesday suggested that the NDA is likely to return to power with around 148 seats. The RJD-led Mahagathbandhan, despite campaigning on a platform of change, is projected to finish with around 88 seats, while other parties may secure about 7 seats.People’s Pulse estimated 133–159 seats for the NDA, 75–101 for the Mahagathbandhan, 0–5 for Jan Suraaj, and 2–8 for others. The Dainik Bhaskar poll projected 145–160 seats for the NDA and 73–91 for the Mahagathbandhan. It further suggested that Jan Suraaj may not win any seat, while others could secure 5–10.According to JVC-Polls, the NDA could win 135–150 seats, the Mahagathbandhan 88–103, and others 3–6.

Bihar election results: Prashant Kishor yet to come of age; poll debut proves to be a dud,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-election-results-prashant-kishor-yet-to-come-of-age-poll-debut-proves-to-be-a-dud/articleshow/125340199.cms,"‘Misa-Priyanka Ko Dickey Mein…’: Yashwant Deshmukh’s Message to RJD–Cong After NDA’s Bihar Win

This Kishor can’t sing: Bihar tunes out PKNEW DELHI: Prashant Kishor has often been credited for being the scriptwriter of the electoral successes of several political parties and satraps. His most anticipated script has, however, turned out to be a spectacular dud.When he started his public outreach in Bihar with a padyatra from Champaran three years ago, he dominated headlines because of his communication skills that mixed cocky predictions with unconventionally sharp attacks on regional satraps. He promised to deliver the state from the woes of unemployment and unceasing 'palayan' (migration).What added to his appeal was that he had worked with leading politicians, including PM Narendra Modi, and a host of regional heavyweights, such as CMs like Nitish Kumar and Mamata Banerjee, during some of their successful electoral battles. A trailblazer as poll strategist, his successes made waves while failures like the one in UP assembly polls in 2017 did not diminish his image.Unlike most election strategists who prefer the backroom and keep a low profile, he never shied away from offering punditry and denouncing politicians who he believed were not charitable to him, Rahul Gandhi being a famous example after talks of his joining Congress fell through.Some of his predictions, like BJP failing to cross 100 seats in West Bengal in 2021, proved correct and some others missed the mark. But his profile grew, leading to a sense of anticipation before his Jan Suraaj Party's debut in Bihar. His meetings and roadshows drew crowds and his interviews were much sought after.As the dust kicked up by NDA's tsunami settles in Bihar, Kishor and his ambition lie buried. He had claimed that Nitish, whose party he had joined in 2018 with much fanfare before being expelled in 2020 for publicly scorning him for supporting the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, will not be the next CM and his party, JDU, will not win more than 25 seats. As of 10.30pm, JDU had won 85 seats and Nitish is expected to be sworn in again.Kishor's assertion that he will quit politics if this were to happen may come back to haunt him. As a political strategist, he has lost his sheen.However, the annihilation of RJD-led Mahagathbandhan has also opened a narrow path for his unconventional politics that has so far shunned caste calculations and prioritised issues of universal public good like education and employment.","Prashant Kishor has often been credited for being the scriptwriter of the electoral successes of several political parties and satraps.

NEW DELHI: It may be the first time in three decades that RJD doesn't have a single member in Rajya Sabha when the next Bihar assembly elections come around in 2030.The party now has five members in the upper house, but it will gradually lose these seats even if a non-NDA party - like AIMIM with five MLAs in the new Bihar assembly - supports it in Rajya Sabha elections in 2026 and 2028.In 2030, RJD may retain one of its seats if it gets AIMIM support. But it appears a distant possibility as smaller parties invariably go by the politics of the day and their own interests.Out of five RJD members in Rajya Sabha, two - Prem Chand Gupta, the party's leader in the House, and A D Singh - will retire in April 2026. The third one, Faiyaz Ahmad, will retire in July 2028; and the remaining two, Manoj Kumar Jha and Sanjay Yadav, will complete their term in April 2030.In 2026, elections will be held for five vacancies, including two from JDU and another from Rashtriya Lok Morcha (both NDA allies). The strength of the new assembly will help NDA gain all five seats from Bihar next year.Similarly, five members - three from BJP, and one each from JDU and RJD - will retire in 2028. These five seats too will go in favour of NDA.","The party now has five members in the upper house, but it will gradually lose these seats even if a non-NDA party supports it in Rajya Sabha elections in 2026 and 2028.

Slow Traffic, Then Sudden Fireball: CCTV Captures The Delhi Red Fort Blast That Killed At Least 10

SRINAGAR: It took a doctor-cop to catch a “white-collar” terrorist network of doctors. When Jaish-e-Mohammed posters appeared overnight on Oct 19 across Nowgam-Bunpora in Srinagar, warning security forces of “dire consequences”, most residents brushed it off as a ghost from Kashmir’s violent past. For Srinagar SSP Dr GV Sundeep Chakravarthy, the signs were too deliberate — and too dangerous — to ignore.By dawn, he had ordered a case under UAPA, Explosive Substances Act, and Arms Act at Nowgam police station. CCTV footage combed frame by frame revealed three men. They were detained. Interrogation led to one name — Moulvi Irfan Ahmad of Shopian, who had led prayers at Nowgam mosque since 2020.Police teams moved fast. Ahmad’s Shopian home was searched. Another residence in Nowgam was examined. Digital footprints traced from his communications pointed to operatives beyond J&K — connections stretching into Haryana and UP.A team was dispatched. In coordinated follow-up action, police took custody of Muzammil Ahmad Ganaie, a doctor from Pulwama working in a Faridabad medical college and allegedly linked to the Jaish network. What had begun as an inquiry into wall posters turned into the exposure of a sophisticated cross-state, “white-collar” module.Three Nowgam residents were also held.A senior officer called the effort “a thorough forward-and-backward investigation that mapped every link in the chain”. “It was a good investigative effort that led to the arrest of doctors based in UP and Haryana. During questioning, more links were identified, which led to seizures, including IED-making material,” the officer said.For Chakravarthy, the 2014-batch IPS officer, this was another chapter in a career defined by frontline counterterror operations. Born in Kallur in Andhra Pradesh’s Kurnool, son of retired govt medical officer Dr GV Rama Gopal Rao and health department official PC Rangamma, he studied medicine at Kurnool Medical College and graduated in 2010. He served there briefly as a doctor before trading the stethoscope for the service revolver.On Aug 14, he received his sixth President’s Police Medal for Gallantry for his role in multiple antiterrorism operations in J&K. He took charge as SSP Srinagar on Apr 21 this year. The poster probe now stands as one of his most intricate investigations — one that allegedly peeled back layers of radicalisation and revealed an unlikely alliance of a moulvi, medics, and modules.","Jaish-e-Mohammed posters appeared overnight on Oct 19 across Nowgam-Bunpora in Srinagar.

PATNA: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday said he was shocked at the outcome of Bihar poll as the Grand Old Party witnessed its worst ever performance in an assembly election in the state.The party, which is a part of the Grand Alliance, contested in 61 seats but won only six (strike rate of 9.83%). In 2020, the party contested 70 seats and won 19 (with a strike rate of 27.14%). All its prominent leaders, including state president Rajesh Kumar, Congress legislative party (CLP) leader Shakeel Ahmad Khan and former CLP leader Ajit Sharma, lost the election.In a post on social media, Gandhi alleged the election was not fair from the start. He wrote, ""I express my heartfelt gratitude to the millions of voters in Bihar who placed their faith in the Grand Alliance. This result in Bihar is truly shocking. We failed to win an election that was not fair from the start. This fight is to protect the Constitution and democracy.""Party national president Mallikarjun Kharge said the Congress would study the election results in depth and, after understanding the reasons, would present a detailed account.Of the six seats it won, two were by very narrow margins.
