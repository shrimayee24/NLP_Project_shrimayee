NEW DELHI: Congress candidate from North West Delhi Lok Sabha constituency Udit Raj said that after the results of the General Elections are declared all parties of the INDIA bloc will decide on their course of action and may even hit the streets to save democracy.""The leaders of all parties will decide about the options. There will be discussions and then the course of action will be communicated. We will hit the streets to save democracy because democracy is not their (BJP) heritage. It is the heritage of the Congress party...They (BJP) do not believe in democracy, they want to change the Constitution...,"" Udit Raj said speaking to on Monday day before the counting of votes.Dismissing the results of the exit polls, Raj alleged that it seems that these were drafted at the BJP office or there might be a big conspiracy and the results to the Lok Sabha may have been already pre-determined.""The way the exit polls have predicted the results this time it seems that it has been drafted at the BJP office.

There was complacency as well since there was a 4-day holiday,"" the Congress leader said.""The BJP people did not brave the sun on voting day, Dalits voted in large numbers on the issue of the Constitution, Muslims voted for their safety, farmers who were agitated also voted, and the youth were also complaining because of inflation and unemployment.

NEW DELHI: A day after Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal surrendered at Tihar jail as as his interim bail ended, The Aam Aadmi Party on Monday claimed that he was not provided with cooler in his cell despite the soaring temperatures in Delhi. His party leaders also claimed that his weight was measured thrice using different machines in a "" conspiracy "" on the behalf of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). However, Tihar jail authorities refuted these claims.In a press conference, senior AAP leader and Delhi minister Atishi claimed that Kejriwal's weight was measured with three weighing machines during his medical examination in Tihar on Sunday. She also claimed that at a time when temperature in Delhi is ranging from 48 degrees to 50 degrees, Kejriwal was kept in a cell where not even a cooler was provided.""Coolers are provided to even notorious criminals lodged in Tihar. While the popular Chief Minister Kejriwal has not been given the cooler.

""In the jail, Arvind Kejriwal's weight was measured thrice with different machines, one showed 61 kg, the second 64 kg, the third 66.5 kg. Whereas when he was weighed at home before leaving, it was 63 kg. What kind of joke is this?

NEW DELHI: On the eve of Lok Sabha elections counting day, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge on Monday wrote a letter to civil servants and officers urging them to discharge their duties ""in the spirit of the Constitution, without any coercion, threat, pressure or intimidation either from the ruling party/coalition or from the opposition party/coalition"".Contending that ""the last decade has witnessed a systemic pattern to assault, undermine and suppress our autonomous institutions by the ruling party"", Kharge urged the bureaucracy ""to adhere to the Constitution, enact their duties, and serve the nation, without fear, favour and ill-will against anybody"".""Do not get intimidated by anyone. Do not bow down to any Unconstitutional means. Do not be afraid of anyone and discharge your duties, based on merit, on this counting day. We owe it to future generations, a vibrant Democracy and a long-lasting Constitution, as penned by the makers of modern India,"" he added.An Appeal to all the Civil Servants and OfficersMy dear esteemed members of bureaucracy, our civil servants & officers,I am writing you in the capacity of the Leader of the Opposition (Rajya Sabha) and as President of the Indian National Congress . The elections for the 18th Lok Sabha have concluded and the counting of votes shall take place tomorrow, on June 4th, 2024.I must congratulate the Election Commission of India, the Central Armed Forces, Police in various states, Civil Servants, District Collectors, Volunteers and each one of you who were involved in conducting this mammoth and historic task.Our inspiration and India’s First Home Minister, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel famously called the civil servants as the “Steel frame of India.” The people of India are well aware that it is the Indian National Congress which established numerous institutions, laid their solid foundation, and devised mechanisms for their independence, on the basis of the Constitution of India.Independence of the institutions is paramount, for every civil servant takes oath of the Constitution that they “will faithfully and conscientiously discharge their duties and will do right to all manner of people in accordance with the Constitution and the law, without fear or favour, affection or ill-will”. In this spirit we expect every bureaucrat and officer – from top to bottom of the hierarchy, to discharge their duties in the spirit of the Constitution, without any coercion, threat, pressure or intimidation either from the ruling party/coalition or from the opposition party/coalition.It is important to underline the fact that the Congress party, through the Constitution prepared by our inspirational founding members such as Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Dr B R Ambedkar, Dr Rajendra Prasad, Maulana Azad, Sarojini Naidu and countless others, not only created a framework of strong governance, but also ensured affirmative action through representation of the marginalised in the bureaucracy and the civil society, in our autonomous institutions.The last decade has witnessed a systemic pattern to assault, undermine and suppress our autonomous institutions by the ruling party. India’s Democratic ethos are being consequently damaged. There is a widespread tendency to turn India into a regimental dictatorship. We are increasingly seeing some institutions shedding their independence and brazenly following the diktats of the ruling party. Some have completely adopted their style of communication, their way of functioning, and in some cases even their political rhetoric. It is not their fault. With brute power, threat, coercive mechanisms and misuse of agencies, this tendency to bow to the powers that have become a way for their short-term survival. Even though, in this denigration, India’s Constitution and Democracy have become a casualty.The ‘Will of the People’ is supreme, and people want Indian bureaucracy, to return back to the same ‘Steel frame of India’ envisaged by Sardar Patel – which has been Teflon-coated by our strong Constitutional principles, that have stood the test of the time.Indian National Congress now urges the entire bureaucracy, to adhere to the Constitution, enact their duties, and serve the nation, without fear, favour and ill-will against anybody. Do not get intimidated by anyone. Do not bow down to any Unconstitutional means. Do not be afraid of anyone and discharge your duties, based on merit, on this counting day. We owe it to future generations, a vibrant Democracy and a long-lasting Constitution, as penned by the makers of modern India.In this hope that India remains truly Democratic in nature, I extend good wishes to each one of you, and expect that our eternal ideals of the Constitution remain untarnished.","Mallikarjun Kharge wrote a letter to civil servants and officers on Monday. He urged them to discharge their duties ""in the spirit of the Constitution"" ""We owe it to future generations, a vibrant Democracy and a long-lasting Constitution,"" he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110673874,imgsize-59256,width-400,resizemode-4/110673874.jpg"

BHUBANESWAR: An exit poll by Times Now-ETG predicted on Monday a near-repeat of the 2019 landslide for Naveen Patnaik ’s BJD in the Odisha assembly polls, differing from other projections that show the party either neck and neck with challenger BJP or not ahead by much.BJD is likely to win 100 to 115 seats in the 147-member assembly, with a projected vote share of 46%, the exit poll says. In 2019, BJD won 112 seats with a 44.7% vote share. BJP is tipped to get between 30 and 38 seats, with a vote share of around 38%. If this holds, it will be an improvement on the saffron party’s 2019 performance, when it won 23 seats with a 32.49% vote share. Congress is expected to face a significant setback, with the exit poll suggesting the grand old party may win four to seven seats with an 11% vote share. In 2019, Congress had nine seats with a 17.02% vote share.“People of Odisha’s faith in BJD is unwavering. With the blessings of Mahaprabhu Jagannath and the love of people, CM Naveen Patnaik will script history by winning a record 6th term,” BJD Rajya Sabha member Manas Mangaraj wrote on X.The exit poll projection has shored up BJD’s morale, especially after some agencies predicted over the weekend that the regional party might cede ground to BJP. The India Today-Axis exit poll, released on Sunday, suggested a close contest between BJD and BJP, with both parties projected to win between 62 and 80 seats. The poll put Congress at five to eight seats.Lok Sabha exit polls released on Saturday showed BJP might get between 13 and 19 of the 21 seats in Odisha, up from its 2019 tally of eight. BJD, which won 12 in 2019, is expected to win between two and seven seats. Congress might retain its lone seat or draw a blank. “Change has already happened. People have given their mandate to BJP, which will form the next govt in the state,” state BJP president Manmohan Samal said.Describing the exit polls as “doctored and motivated”, Congress’s Jayadev Jena said all exit polls would be proven wrong on Tuesday.","BJD is likely to win 100 to 115 seats in the 147-member assembly.

NEW DELHI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED), in a supplementary chargesheet against K Kavitha , Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) leader and daughter of Telangana chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao, has alleged that she paid a kickback of ₹100 crore to the leaders of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in connection with the Delhi excise policy case . The agency also said that more than Rs 1,100 crore was laundered in the alleged Delhi excise scam.The probe agency also claimed that Kavitha deleted crucial evidence from her phone before handing it over to them.The ED stated in the chargesheet, ""As per the investigation carried so far, Vijay Nair, on behalf of leaders of AAP has at least received kickbacks to the tune of ₹100 crore from a group, called South Group (controlled by Sarath Reddy, Ms K Kavitha, Magunta Srinivasulu Reddy) by various persons including Amit Arora.""The agency further alleged that Kavitha changed 10 phones in a span of 3-4 days and deleted all the data stored on the cloud after the scam came to light.The ED said, ""The 10 phones were changed in a span of 3-4 days soon after she had her phone examined by the agency on March 11, 2023.

Gandhi made the remarks after attending an event here to pay tribute to DMK stalwart M Karunanidhi on his 100th birth anniversary.On the eve of counting, Congress continued to talk up the possibility of the results being rigged even as it denied that it had finalised a detailed protest plan in the event of the results being on the lines of the exit polls.At the same time, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge appealed to bureaucrats to discharge their duties “without coercion or political pressure”, reinforcing concerns the opposition has expressed in the wake of the exit polls.“Do not get intimidated by anyone. Do not bow down to any unconstitutional means. Do not be afraid of anyone and discharge your duties, based on merit, on this counting day. We owe it to future generations, a vibrant democracy and a long-lasting Constitution, as penned by the makers of modern India,” Kharge said in a public appeal.Congress also asked all its workers to be vigilant during counting of votes, be present in their district and state headquarters and report any kind of mischief to the party’s monitoring cell . The party has informed all party workers that a monitoring centre will be open 24x7 at AICC headquarters in Delhi where any kind of wrongdoing noticed during the counting process must be reported.The party called for caution, claiming that in the past few days they had seen BJP and its govt “violate the democratic and constitutional process” during elections.A news agency handle had posted a story claiming that INDIA bloc leaders had been asked to reach the national capital by Tuesday night or early Wednesday, and they would thrash out a plan for public protests if results were not up to their estimates.Replying to the post, Congress spokesperson Jairam Ramesh said, “INDIA leaders will obviously meet after the results are declared.

NEW DELHI: The Nizamabad Lok Sabha constituency in Telangana, with its rich political history, stands out as a critical battleground in the 2024 general elections. Since its inception in 1952, Nizamabad has been predominantly a Congress stronghold, although various parties like the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) have also claimed victories over the years.Following the formation of Telangana, the Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) won the seat for the first time in the 2014 General Elections. In the 2024 general elections, held on May 13 during the fourth phase, Nizamabad recorded a voter turnout of 71.92%. This election features key candidates such as the incumbent MP Arvind Dharmapuri from BJP, T Jeevan Reddy from the Indian National Congress (INC), and Bajireddy Goverdhan from the BRS.In the 2019 elections, Arvind Dharmapuri of BJP emerged victorious with 45.22% of the votes, defeating TRS's Kalvakuntla Kavitha, who secured 38.55%. This win marked a significant shift in the constituency's political landscape, where the BJP's influence surged. The 2014 elections had seen TRS’s Kalvakuntla Kavitha winning the seat with 42.49% of the votes, indicating the constituency's fluctuating political allegiances.The 2024 election in Nizamabad is poised to be a critical contest as Arvind Dharmapuri of BJP seeks to retain his seat amidst anti-incumbency sentiments and evolving political dynamics. The Congress has strategically fielded T Jeevan Reddy, aiming to leverage the party's historical strength and the shifting voter sentiment. The BRS, which had a strong showing in 2014, is contesting with Bajireddy Goverdhan to reclaim the seat.The election is marked by intense competition and has significant implications for both local and state politics. Nizamabad’s large and diverse electorate, combined with its complex political history, makes it a focal point in Telangana’s political landscape. The robust voter turnout and dynamic candidate profiles highlight the evolving political preferences of the electorate and the strategic maneuvers of the involved parties. The outcome of the 2024 Nizamabad Lok Sabha election will be pivotal in shaping the future political narrative of the region, reflecting the ongoing contest between BJP, INC, and BRS.",Nizamabad Lok Sabha Election Results 2024.
