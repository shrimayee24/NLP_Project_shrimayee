Married 25 men in 7 months: 'Loot and scoot' bride arrested from Bhopal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/loot-and-scoot-bride-held-after-25-marriages-in-7-mths/articleshow/121275795.cms,"



JAIPUR: In an intriguing case of matrimonial fraud , a 23-year-old woman who allegedly married 25 different men across multiple states in just seven months has been arrested by Rajasthan Police. Anuradha Paswan , dubbed the "" loot-and-scoot bride "" by police, was arrested in Bhopal by Sawai Madhopur police Monday.The accused, who was part of a sophisticated marriage racket , would target desperate grooms and flee with their valuables shortly after the wedding.According to investigation officer Meetha Lal from Manpur police station, Anuradha had perfected her modus operandi. She would present herself as a bride, marry her victims using legal paperwork, stay for a few days and then vanish under the cover of night with stolen gold, cash and electronics.The scam came to light after Vishnu Sharma, a resident of Sawai Madhopur, lodged a complaint on May 3. Sharma said he had paid Rs 2 lakh to two agents, Sunita and Pappu Meena, who promised to arrange a suitable match for him. Presented with Anuradha as the ideal bride, the marriage was solemnised on April 20 at a local court. However, just days later, on May 2, she fled with valuable items.Anuradha's background adds a layer of complexity to this case.Previously employed at a hospital in Maharajganj, Uttar Pradesh, she had separated from her husband after a domestic dispute and moved to Bhopal. There, she became involved with a gang of marriage fraudsters who operated through a network of local agents. These agents showcased prospective brides via WhatsApp, demanding amounts between Rs 2 to Rs 5 lakh for their services. Once the marriage was conducted, the bride would typically flee within a week.Police have identified several other suspects involved in the operation, including individuals named Roshni, Raghubir, Golu, Majboot Singh Yadav and Arjan, all hailing from various neighbourhoods in Bhopal.After her disappearance from Sharma's residence, Anuradha allegedly married another man named Gabbar in Bhopal and collected Rs 2 lakh from him as well. Anuradha's arrest was made possible when police sent an undercover constable posing as a prospective groom. When an agent shared her photo, investigators seized the opportunity and arrested her.","Anuradha Paswan, 23, was arrested in Bhopal by Sawai Madhopur police Monday.

"Multi-state insurance scam: Notices to MCD, Delhi govt over issue of fake death certificates",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/multi-state-insurance-scam-notices-to-mcd-delhi-govt-over-issue-of-fake-death-certificates/articleshow/121281948.cms,"The Delhi High Court has addressed notices to MCD and Delhi government regarding lapses in death certificate issuance, prompted by a plea citing a large-scale insurance scam.





MEERUT: Delhi High Court has issued notices to Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) and Delhi govt via chief secretary over alleged lapses in issuance of death certificates without proper verification protocols. The move follows a plea filed by Noida-based advocate Praveen Pathak, who cited TOI reports highlighting a large-scale life insurance scam spanning at least 12 states.A division bench comprising Chief Justice Devendra Kumar Upadhyaya and Justice Tushar Rao Gedela, on May 14, directed MCD and Delhi govt to file a counter-affidavit ""within four weeks"". The high court bench also instructed the respondents to address each paragraph of the writ petition and clarify whether a statutory mechanism is in place for issuing death certificates. The matter is scheduled for next hearing on Sept 24.The plea cites a more disturbing national scam, now under the Enforcement Directorate (ED) lens. The scam first came to light on Jan 17, when Sambhal police intercepted an SUV carrying large amounts of cash and forged papers. Taking cognisance of the huge scam, ED's Lucknow unit, last week, registered a money laundering case against a criminal syndicate allegedly involved in fraudulent life and vehicle insurance policies amounting to over Rs 500 crore.The gang has been accused not only of fabricating policies and documentation but also of orchestrating murders to claim insurance payouts.Notably, a TOI report in Feb revealed how the MCD issued two death certificates for the same individual, Trilok Kumar - first in June 2024 (his actual death) and again in Dec the same year. The second certificate was allegedly used by fraudsters to claim insurance worth Rs 22 lakh. The policies were bought three months after Kumar passed away.Noida-based advocate and petitioner in this matter, Praveen Pathak, said: ""Due to gross negligence by MCD, accused persons fraudulently claimed insurance payouts using forged death certificates. In many cases, policies were issued in the names of the dead, and fake certificates were obtained later to support the claims. This is not just a procedural lapse - it's a constitutional violation of the rights of those affected. Besides, crores of rupees have been siphoned off through meticulously planned and fabricated claims in a fraud running unhindered in 12 states -- which is disturbing -- and hence the PIL.""Pathak added that loopholes in schemes like the Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana -which does not require extensive verification beyond a death certificate - make such frauds easier. ""The absence of a mandatory Aadhaar or unique ID check allows civic bodies to issue incorrect certificates without scrutiny,"" he said.After the Jan 17 episode, subsequent investigations revealed the racket's operations across multiple states and involved a disturbing pattern - targeting terminally-ill and vulnerable individuals to obtain insurance policies under false pretences.",Delhi High Court has issued notices to MCD and Delhi govt over alleged lapses in death certificates.

SC grants four week status quo on proposed demolition of dargah near Mumbai,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/sc-grants-four-week-status-quo-on-proposed-demolition-of-dargah-near-mumbai/articleshow/121273270.cms,"



Swati DeshpandeMumbai: The Supreme Court Bench, headed by Chief Justice of India Bhushan Gavai, on Monday granted a four-week status quo over claims of a proposed demolition near dargah at Uttan, near Mumbai. A petition filed by Balepeer Shah Charitable Trust stated that on May 16, the vacation bench of Bombay HC declined to intervene, but one of its members was informed of the impending demolition on May 20.The HC vacation bench of Justices Kamal Khata and Arif Doctor declined to intervene, stating that urgency was not made out since no demolition notice was issued by the state authority to the trust. The trust then moved the SC for orders to direct the state to follow due process of law. Its counsel, V Navarre, with advocate Prashant Pandey, contended there was an impending threat of demolition of the structure, which was in existence for more than eight decades. The urgency was wrongly ignored by the HC, said lawyers for the Trust, citing a notice dated May 15, 2025, received by its member from a senior police inspector of Uttan Sagari police station of the Mira Bhayandar and Vasai Virar commissionerate under Section 168 of BNSS. The notice stated that the state govt declared the unauthorised construction of the dargah would be removed on or before May 20, 2025, and that the members of the petitioner's trust were warned against creating any law and order situation.Recently, revenue minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule, in response to a question raised on the issue of the dargah by legislator Niranjan Davkhare in the state Legislative Council, assured its demolition. It has been alleged that the Bale Shah Peer Charitable Trust encroached upon protected mangrove belts located on govt-owned land parcels near the sensitive Chowk jetty in Uttan near Bhayandar. The Trust denied the allegations and said the HC erred by ""adopting a hyper-technical approach"" and ignored the fact that the police authorities stated in their notice that the authorities would remove the structure and render its plea before the court infructuous unless a stay is granted. The Dargah is of ""Hazrat Sayyed Peer,"" the Trust said.The trust also informed the SC that Bawankule mentioned before the Maharashtra state assembly on March 29, 2025, that the structure would be demolished. The trust has already approached the chief minister, revenue minister, and the state secretary and has claimed it is being arbitrarily targeted by the govt without following the due process of law. Fearing it may be too late if illegally demolished, the trust sought a stay from the SC.
