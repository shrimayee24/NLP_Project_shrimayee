'Hate-filled agenda': Cong slams arrest of Nagpur Christian priest; demands action against Bajrang Dal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hate-filled-agenda-cong-slams-arrest-of-nagpur-christian-priest-demands-action-against-bajrang-dal/articleshow/126275380.cms,"KC Venugopal (ANI)

NEW DELHI: Congress on Wednesday strongly criticised the BJP following the arrest of a Christian priest and 11 others in Nagpur, Maharashtra, during a Christmas prayer meeting, accusing the party of pursuing a “hate-filled agenda of religious bigotry. ”The Maharashtra Police arrested 12 individuals, including Father Sudhir, a Malayali priest of the CSI South Kerala Diocese, Nagpur Mission, and his wife Jasmine, after a complaint allegedly filed by Bajrang Dal activists. The arrests reportedly took place around 8.00 pm during a Christmas prayer meeting in Nagpur.According to the leaders, people who later went to the police station to enquire about the incident were also taken into custody, and cases were registered against them.Congress MP KC Venugopal in an official post on X described the incident as “highly condemnable” and alleged that the arrest showed the BJP ""uses the state machinery to harass Christians under the bogus pretense of religious conversions.""Venugopal said growing polarisation had made life “unlivable for all minorities” in BJP-ruled states. He demanded that the FIR against the priest be withdrawn immediately and called for strict action against what he described as “Bajrang Dal goons,” whose alleged “hooliganism” led to what he termed a “frivolous case.”He said, “Those who take law into their own hands and destroy the secular fabric envisioned in our Constitution must be the ones receiving punishment - not innocent citizens.”Kerala Assembly Leader of Opposition VD Satheesan also condemned the arrests and sought urgent intervention from the Centre and the Maharashtra government. In a post on X, he tagged PM Modi and Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, demanding the release of all those arrested.In his letter, Satheesan wrote, “I write this letter to register my strong protest and to seek your urgent intervention regarding the arrest of twelve persons, including a Malayali priest, in Nagpur on allegations of forced religious conversion.”He added that Father Sudhir is a native of Amaravila in Thiruvananthapuram district and has been serving in Maharashtra for the past five years, while the remaining 10 arrested individuals are natives of Maharashtra.Satheesan said all the arrested persons are currently being detained at the Benoda Police Station and are likely to be produced before a court shortly. He noted that CSI representatives attempted to secure bail at the police station but were directed to approach the court.Describing the incident as alarming, he said, “This incident is deeply disturbing and raises serious concerns about the violation of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution of India, particularly the freedom to profess, practice, and propagate religion. Arresting individuals for conducting a peaceful prayer meeting is unconstitutional and contrary to the spirit of our democratic and secular values. ”","The Maharashtra Police arrested 12 individuals, including Father Sudhir, a Malayali priest of the CSI South Kerala Diocese, Nagpur Mission, and his wife Jasmine.

‘Amit Shah’s Hands Were Shaking’: Rahul Gandhi Hits Out At BJP-RSS, Warns EC In ‘Vote Chori’ Rally

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission Wednesday issued a strict warning that intimidation of electoral staff by political workers will not be tolerated and that stringent action will be taken against miscreants who attempt to take the law into their own hands.After a meeting with a TMC delegation, officials said the poll panel urged party netas to ensure their ground-level representatives do not threaten staff on election duty. ""Intimidation of any electoral staff, including booth-level officers (BLOs), electoral roll officers, assistant EROs, and observers, by political representatives will not be tolerated,"" an official said.EC also urged the West Bengal govt to immediately release the enhanced honorarium for BLOs, as approved by the commission. In response, AITC sources said CEC Gyanesh Kumar should write to Union finance minister seeking release of Rs 2 lakh crore of Bengal's allegedly blocked funds. They added that even if the funds are not released, the AITC-led govt would pay a Rs 50,000 honorarium to BLOs if such a letter is written.In a separate development, the CEO of West Bengal informed Wednesday that it had received only eight claims and objections from over two lakh booth-level agents of national- and state-level political parties for inclusion of names in the electoral roll between Dec 17 and 31 after the publication of the draft electoral roll on Dec 16.","EC urges party netas to ensure their ground-level representatives do not threaten staff on election duty.

‘Amit Shah’s Hands Were Shaking’: Rahul Gandhi Hits Out At BJP-RSS, Warns EC In ‘Vote Chori’ Rally

NEW DELHI: After its delegation met the full bench of the Election Commission on Wednesday, Trinamool Congress national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee alleged that 'vote chori' (vote theft) is not happening in the EVM rather it is being done through manipulation of electoral rolls and Congress and other opposition parties failed to catch it in states like Haryana, Maharashtra, Delhi and Bihar where they lost in the assembly polls.""If they would have caught that - BJP would have lost in these states,"" Banerjee said while highlighting that TMC will not let this happen in West Bengal which goes to the polls in a few months.While training his guns at the EC and BJP, Banerjee urged like-minded parties to catch the votetheft, allegedly being done through manipulation using software in voter rolls.Banerjee, the Lok Sabha MP from Diamond Harbour said that the battle against “vote theft” cannot be won through debates on TV channels or social media and asserted that opposition parties - the Congress and others will have to be on the ground, at polling booths, to thwart manipulation at the stage of special intensive revision (SIR) and special summary revision.The remarks came after a 10 - member TMC delegation led by Banerjee met the Election Commission led by chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar and raised various concerns related to the Special Intensive Revision process in West Bengal. Banerjee said he told the CEC that “you are weaponising the electoral rolls”.“The EC has failed to address most of the concerns that we raised. We will not accept the final voter list if it has discrepancies”, Banerjee said alleging collusion between the EC and BJP.He said that the TMC was ready to ""fight it legally"" if required going forward. The 10-member delegation included MPs Derek O'Brien, Saket Gokhale, Kalyan Banerjee, Nadimul Haque, Ritabrata Banerjee and Mamata Thakur, and ministers from West Bengal. In the meeting with the Election Commission led by chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar they raised various concerns related to the SIR process in West Bengal. Banerjee said he told the CEC that “you are trying to weaponise the electoral rolls”.Banerjee also alleged that Kumar was ""aggressive"" during the meeting and challenged the CEC to release the CCTV footage of the nearly two and a half hour meeting. He said the party would fight it legally if EC failed to address its concerns on SIR.Pointing that people wanted to vote for opposition parties like Cong, AAP and RJD in Haryana, Maharashtra, Delhi and Bihar, Banerjee said, “If the Congress had been able to catch this it would have won and the BJP would have lost. I appeal to all like-minded parties, especially those in the opposition: the theft is happening in the voter list, in the software, not in the EVM. You are failing to understand what algorithms and software are being run to disenfranchise and remove voters,” he asserted.He also questioned the EC's move to retroactively introduce a new category termed ""logical discrepancies"", summoning 1.36 crore voters for hearing on different grounds, including issues like unreasonable age gaps between parents and children, name and surname mismatches and address related issues. The party has demanded why the detailed discrepancy list has not been made public.Among the various issues raised with the EC, the TMC has challenged the poll panel to come out with the list of Bangladeshis and Rohingyas among the 58 lakh voters whose names have been deleted in the draft electoral roll. ""There is selective targeting, allegations of infiltration, which are leaked to malign West Bengal,"" Banerjee alleged.","Abhishek Banerjee says 'vote theft' is not happening in the EVM rather it is being done through manipulation of electoral rolls. TMC will not let this happen in West Bengal which goes to the polls in a few months, he says.

'Will Rid Bengal Of Infiltrators': Amit Shah Slams Mamata Banerjee’s 14-Year Rule, Sounds Poll Bugle

KOLKATA: Union home minister Amit Shah urged BJP functionaries and workers in Bengal to mentally lock in victory in the 2026 assembly elections. ""Dil pe likh lo, is baar hamari sarkar (Write it on your hearts, this time it's our govt),"" Shah said Wednesday, hours before leaving Kolkata.Addressing party workers, Shah set a specific target. ""Our workers have been killed and that has bled our hearts. This time, I want 22 out of 28 seats from areas in and around Kolkata,"" he said. On Tuesday, Shah had said BJP would form next govt in Bengal with a two-thirds majority.Kolkata district and adjoining urban pockets include constituencies such as Jadavpur, Dumdum, and central neighbourhoods like Jorasanko and Shyampukur. BJP failed to win a single assembly seat in these areas in the 2021 state polls, but led in Jorasanko and Shyampukur during the 2024 LS election count.During his hour-long address, Shah referred to Bhowanipore, the constituency from which CM Mamata Banerjee won the 2021 bypolls. When he initially said BJP had led in three civic wards there, party worker Navin Mishra stood up to correct him. Shah accepted the correction.""Hard work helped us lead in five civic wards in Bhowanipore,"" Shah said, revising his remark.Party seniors said Shah wants a breakthrough in the wider Kolkata belt - nearly 140 seats across Kolkata's periphery, North and South 24 Parganas districts to the east and south, and Howrah district across Hooghly river to the west. ""These are areas where the party is still weak. Shah wants us to penetrate this zone,"" a Bengal BJP neta said.Shah raised concerns about alleged infiltration and what he described as a ""changing demography"" around Kolkata. ""He said we may not fully grasp the danger now, but Kolkata is no longer safe. Infiltration will rise and the consequences will be serious,"" a functionary said, quoting him.The home minister also sought to counter perceptions of organisational weakness in the state. ""He told us to ignore narratives about a weak organisation. Compared to 2021, our strength has improved a lot,"" the neta added.Trinamool spokesperson Kunal Ghosh, meanwhile, dismissed Shah's claim that BJP will win Bengal in 2026 polls, saying party workers were being fed ""daydreams"" and faulty arithmetic. ""BJP's maths is wrong,"" Ghosh said, alleging the saffron party was building a narrative that Trinamool's victory margins would be offset by voter deletions under EC's SIR. ""Every 70-75% turnout means 25-30% didn't vote. Deletions will fall there. Let them daydream.""Responding to BJP's corruption allegations, he said netas facing graft charges ""turn saints"" after joining BJP, calling it ""the biggest washing machine"". Ghosh also rejected BJP criticism of Bengal's record on women's safety, citing cases such as Unnao, Hathras and Bilkis Bano in BJP-governed states.","Union home minister Amit Shah urged BJP functionaries and workers in Bengal to mentally lock in victory in the 2026 assembly elections.
