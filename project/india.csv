Poll Do You Agree with the Complaint Raised for Distributing Shoes? No, It’s a Minor Incident Yes, It’s a Violation of Election Rules

NEW DELHI: An election official on Wednesday asked the Delhi police to register a case against BJP candidate Parvesh Verma for distributing shoes to voters.In the complaint, the returning officer claimed Verma distributed shoes to electors of his New Delhi assembly constituency.""Parvesh Sahib Singh Verma, prospective BJP candidate is distributing shoes to electors of New Delhi Assembly Constituency in the religious campus of Valmiki Temple near Mandir Marg, Police Station,"" the complaint, which was filed at Mandir Marg Police Station, read.The poll officer said what Verma did came under the preview of ""corrupt practices"" as per section 123 of the Representation of People Act, 1951. The officer said the BJP candidate's act was also in violation of the Model Code of Conduct (MCC).This is not the first time that the BJP's New Delhi candidate has got into the centre of controversy for undertaking distributions. Last month, Verma spurred electoral heat in the poll-bound capital when he handed out Rs 1,100 to women in his constituency.AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal labelled him a ""traitor"" while chief minister Atishi called for his immediate arrest.Hitting back, Verma said that by calling him a traitor, Kejriwal had called the entire Jat community traitors. ""My father, Dr Sahib Singh Verma, always helped people. I am also helping people. Delhi's rural areas will never forgive Kejriwal,"" he said.Verma announced his initiative to provide women with Rs 1,100 in financial aid through Rashtriya Swabhiman , an organisation established by his father.He said, unlike Kejriwal, he was offering ""genuine assistance"" to people rather than distributing alcohol.Notably, BJP has pitted Verma against Kejriwal from the high-stake New Delhi assembly constituency that goes to poll on February 5. Both leaders filed poll papers on Wednesday.The results of the Delhi elections will be declared on February 8.","Parvesh Verma distributed shoes to electors of his New Delhi assembly constituency.

It has recommended reforms to ensure that the PM can face a no-confidence motion in parliament.To prevent the concentration of power in the hands of an individual or institution, it has proposed the creation of a constitutional body - national constitutional council (NCC) - to establish a system of checks and balances between the three branches of the state and the two executive positions - PM and president.This council would include the president, chief justice, PM, leaders of opposition of both houses, speakers and deputy speakers from the opposition, and a representative of other parties. The commission has recommended decentralising the judiciary by maintaining the unitary structure of Supreme Court, while establishing permanent high court benches with jurisdiction in all divisional cities.It has also provided a framework for an interim govt to be formed after the dissolution of parliament, and recommended that selection of advisers to such govts should be solely the NCC's responsibility.",The Constitution Reform Commission has recommended introducing a two-term limit on the PM's tenure.
