MUMBAI: With no decision in the Mahayuti yet on who will be CM, Eknath Shinde , accompanied by deputy CMs Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar , met governor CP Radhakrishnan and tendered his resignation and that of his cabinet. The governor has asked Shinde to continue to hold charge of his post till alternate arrangements are made, so Shinde will continue as caretaker CM.Sena MLA Deepak Kesarkar said the resignation is a formality and a decision on the new CM will be taken in New Delhi. With clamour growing in the Sena for him to be CM again, Shinde appealed to Sena workers - some of whom came up with the slogan ''Ek'nath hain to safe hain' to push for him as CM - not to gather at Varsha, the CM's official residence, to demand that he be made CM.Shinde said in a post on X, ""After the great victory of Mahayuti, our govt will be formed once again in the state. As Mahayuti, we contested the election together and are still together today. Out of love for me, some congregations have appealed to everyone to gather together and come to Mumbai. I am deeply grateful for your love. But I appeal that no one should come together in my support in such a manner. Once again, it is my humble request that Shiv Sena workers should not assemble at Varsha or anywhere else. The Mahayuti has been and will continue to be strong for a strong and prosperous Maharashtra.""Meanwhile, Sena functionary Ramdas Kadam on Tuesday said that because of Ajit Pawar's NCP, the Sena's bargaining power to claim the CM's post had reduced in the Mahayuti. Kadam said that NCP had said that they were 'okay' with BJP's Devendra Fadnavis as CM. ""We feel Eknath Shinde should be CM, BJP thinks Fadnavis should be CM. Ajit Pawar has surrendered. He has reduced our bargaining power. No matter what happens, there will be no spat in the Mahayuti. We fought the polls under Eknath Shinde and we have got big success,"" Kadam, a former minister, said.He added, ""People have given a huge mandate to the Mahayuti. We are together and we will abide by whatever decision New Delhi takes. PM Modi and Amit Shah put faith in Shinde and fought the polls. We will come together and take Maharashtra forward on the path of development. We have full faith in Delhi's leadership. , Before the elections, Amit Shah had said that all three parties would sit and decide. Nothing apart from this was said.""While Ajit Pawar was on Sunday unanimously elected group leader of the NCP legislature party, sources said on the question of the chief minister's post, the party has taken the view that in view of the assembly polls results, it would be appropriate if Devendra Fadnavis is placed at the helm of affairs in the state.Sena MP Naresh Mhaske had said on Monday that Shinde should be declared CM by the NDA top brass by following the 'Bihar pattern.'","Eknath Shinde, accompanied by deputy CMs Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar, met governor CP Radhakrishnan and tendered his resignation and that of his cabinet.

'Pre-election deal for CM post': Shinde Sena leader's remark revives memories of Uddhav's claim in 2019,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pre-election-deal-for-cm-post-shinde-sena-leaders-remark-revives-memories-of-uddhavs-claim-in-2019/articleshow/115700876.cms,"NEW DELHI: The BJP in Maharashtra would be feeling a strange sense of deja vu. Five years after Uddhav Thackeray 's Shiv Sena claimed that there was an agreed ""deal"" with the BJP over rotational chief minister, now Eknath Shinde 's Sena says there was a ""deal"" with the saffron party for the top job if Mahayuti won the 2024 assembly elections.A Shiv Sena leader, who is close to caretaker chief minister Eknath Shinde, has claimed that there was an agreement after the Lok Sabha elections that Shinde would take over the reins of the state if Mahayuti won the assembly polls.Read more- Maharashtra govt formation: Deal was Shiv Sena chief would be CM, says neta close to Eknath Shinde The Sena leader said that after the Mahayuti's debacle in the LS polls, there were a series of meetings to draft a strategy for the assembly elections. ""In these meetings, it was decided that BJP would contest the maximum number of seats followed by Shiv Sena and NCP, but ""irrespective of the number of seats the Mahayuti constituents win, Shinde will continue to be the CM if Mahayuti secures a clear majority,"" the leader claimed.The Shiv Sena, which won 57 seats in the assembly elections, is making a strong pitch for continuity at the top and wants the BJP to let Eknath Shinde continue as Mahayuti's chief minister. However, the BJP, with 132 seats in its kitty, which is only 12 short of the half-way mark in the 288-member assembly, is firm about Devendra Fadnavis leading the new government.Rejecting Sena's contentions, BJP leaders say that Union home minister Amit Shah had made it clear during the course of the elections that while Mahayuti was contesting the assembly polls under the leadership of Shinde, but in the event of it securing a clear majority, the new CM would be decided by BJP's parliamentary board and heads of Shiv Sena and NCP.In 2019, after the assembly election results were out, the BJP had faced a similar challenge. The BJP and Shiv Sena, then united under NDA, had secured a comprehensive victory to retain power in the state winning 161 seats after a five-year term under Devendra Fadnavis. However, Uddhav's party, which had won only 56 seats compared to BJP's 105, claimed that the then BJP chief Amit Shah had agreed on rotational chief ministership for the two parties.Amit Shah strongly denied Uddhav's claim. ""No such promise was ever made to them. I make promises not in a closed-door room, but in public meetingsâ€”out in the open, in a loud and clear voice,"" Amit Shah had then said at a public gathering.As the rift over the issue widened, Shiv Sena severed its ties with the BJP and formed a post-poll alliance with NCP and Congress under the banner of Maha Vikas Aghadi and Uddhav Thackeray became the chief minister.However, 2024 is different from 2019. The BJP, with 132 seats under its belt, is in a commanding position and none of its allies is in a position to dictate terms to the saffron party. While Eknath Shinde's party may be pressing hard for the top post, it would not want to strain ties with the BJP and lose the gains it has made in the last two-and-half years. It will be interesting to see how the BJP reacts to Shinde Sena's claim of ""pre-election deal"".","Eknath Shinde's Sena says there was a ""deal"" with the saffron party for the top job if Mahayuti won the 2024 assembly elections.

NEW DELHI: BJP on Tuesday lit into Congress MP Rahul Gandhi for resuming his attack on Veer Savarkar after keeping mum on the Hindutva ideologue during the poll campaign in Maharashtra where he is revered as a social reformer and nationalist.The party cited PM Narendra Modi 's remarks during the Maharashtra campaign that Rahul'' silence was tactical and that he would go back to deriding Savarkar as soon as the elections were over.""How can one be so predictable?"" asked HRD minister Dharmendra Pradhan as he emphasised that PM Modi had been validated. ""PM was absolutely right. By attacking a nationalist, Rahul has confirmed that he is a hard-baked pseudo-secular and an appeaser. Have no hope from Uddhav ji, but am sure that members of his party are watching,"" he added.In his meetings during the Maharashtra campaign, Modi had attacked Shiv Sena (UBT) which counts Savarkar as among its heroes, and Congress for their ""opportunistic"" tie-up. He challenged Uddhav Thackeray to get Rahul to say ""two sentences"" in praise of Balasaheb Thackeray, a Hindutva hardliner and a source of inspiration for Shiv Sena, while predicting that the Congress leader would start mocking Savarkar as soon as the Maharashtra campaign was over.Rahul fired his latest salvo at Savarkar while addressing a Constitution Day event Congress had organised at Talkatora Stadium.Holding up a copy of the Constitution, Rahul asked whether it reflected Savarkar's views or his advocacy for violence - remarks which BJP leaders described as ""derogatory"" towards the freedom fighter.BJP's chief spokesperson Anil Baluni accused Rahul of diminishing the contributions of all but his own forefathers to India's freedom struggle. He labelled Rahul's approach as that of a ""seasonal politician"" whose ideology shifted with electoral tides.Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, revenue minister in Maharashtra's outgoing govt, also condemned Rahul's statement, asking how Congress's new political allies would react to these perceived insults to Savarkar's legacy.BJP's IT department head Amit Malviya said in a post on X, ""Rahul Gandhi is vile and predictable.

UDAIPUR: Rajasthan authorities took control of portions of Udaipur's iconic City Palace Tuesday following violent clashes between two factions of Mewar royal descendants. The unrest stemmed from a decades-long property and succession dispute reignited by a ritual linked to the coronation of Mewar's kings.The conflict pits the family of Arvind Singh Mewar, chairman of Maharana of Mewar Charitable Foundation (MMCF) and younger son of Udaipur's last king Bhagwat Singh Mewar, against descendants of his elder brother Mahendra Singh Mewar, who died on Nov 10 at 83.Mahendra's son Vishvaraj Singh, the BJP MLA for Nathdwara, declared himself the 77th titular head of Mewar royal family and held a ""coronation"" ceremony Monday at Fateh Prakash Palace in Chittorgarh Fort.As part of his accession ritual, Vishvaraj sought entry to a shrine within City Palace, sparking resistance from MMCF and his uncle's family. MMCF had issued public notices barring unauthorised access to the palace and Eklingji temple, both of which are under the trust's control. The trust cited a family history exhibit at the palace that claims Mahendra Singh ""voluntarily and seceded from the family of his father"".Vishvaraj attempted to visit the palace shrine but was blocked, resulting in a scuffle that escalated to stone-throwing outside the mansion. Several people, including police officers, were wounded. The dispute dates back to 1983, when Mahendra Singh challenged his father over leasing and selling stakes in royal properties since 1963. These assets had been transferred to a company established by the family. ""Through his final will dated May 15, 1984, Maharana Bhagwat Singh Mewar appointed Arvind Singh Mewar as executor of the will, which has been probated up to SC,"" said MMCF advocate Sheetal Kumbhat.The trust continues to control several properties, including City Palace and Eklingji temple. This long-standing rift saw the two brothers living separately: Arvind at Shambhu Niwas within City Palace and Mahendra at the nearby Samor Bagh mansion.Vishvaraj criticised the district administration: ""It is my right to visit the temple of my ancestors on such a special occasion. I sought administration's assistance, but they did not help. No one can be stopped from visiting a place of worship.""Arvind's son Lakshyaraj accused his cousin of politicising the situation and misusing his position. ""We are legal occupants of City Palace. If they have any objection, this can be challenged in the court of law,"" he said.
