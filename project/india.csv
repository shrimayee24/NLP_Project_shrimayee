"Nitin Gadkari refuses to fall for Mallikarjun Kharge's bait, corners him instead",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nitin-gadkari-refuses-to-fall-for-mallikarjun-kharges-bait-corners-him-instead/articleshow/119229883.cms,"NEW DELHI: Mallikarjun Kharge 's attempt in Rajya Sabha on Wednesday to play to the perceived differences between PM Modi and Nitin Gadkari did not work as the road transport minister not just refused the bait but also skilfully turned the spotlight on the much-talked about tension in the Congress president's ties with the Karnataka CM and the deputy CM, reports Dipak Dash.Kharge made his manoeuvre while flagging the lack of progress on a four-lane highway project linking Bengaluru to Gulbarga. Midway through his statement, he shifted gears to say the problem could be that Gadkari lacked the power he earlier had.""Things have gone so far that I have heard - if it's wrong I take it back - that even for assigning a number to an NH, you need to go to PMO. I have got such information. If it's wrong, then it is fine. You tell us... You are raising funds through different means, including from bonds and that's because of your own efforts. You have a sharp mind and if they don't give funds, you find ways out,"" the Congress chief said.""Now, you are appreciating the PM, which I didn't expect since while you do all the work, it is the PM who gets all the credit,"" he added.However, Gadkari refused to fall for the praise. ""I want to tell Kharge ji that for assigning numbers to NHs, no file goes to the PM. The PM has appointed me (for the task) and I work as per the mandate given. I face no problem,"" he said.The minister also denied that lack of funds was a constraint, while stating that lack of environmental clearance, failure of state govts to acquire land and court cases were obstacles for highway construction . ""Your chief minister and deputy chief minister agree that more work has been done than ever before. You can ask them, though I don't know whether you have discussions with them,"" Gadkari said, dipping into the speculation about Kharge's not-so-smooth equations with his party colleagues Siddaramaiah and D K Shivakumar, CM and deputy CM of Karnataka, his home state.","Kharge made his manoeuvre while flagging the lack of progress on a four-lane highway project linking Bengaluru to Gulbarga.

NEW DELHI: The discussion on the working of the home ministry in Rajya Sabha on Wednesday took a fiery turn with treasury benches strongly protesting ""objectionable"" remarks made by TMC member Saket Gokhale who, while initiating the debate, took potshots at home minister Amit Shah and the functioning of the ministry.The RS chairman too took strong objection to what he called Gokhale's repeated ""personal observations and remarks"" on Shah and called for deletion and expunction of the same from the proceedings. The chairman said he would give his ruling in the matter on Thursday.Gokhale took on the home ministry and Shah alleging that central agencies like CBI and NIA were being controlled and used to attack govts in opposition-governed states and people who disagreed with BJP dispensation at Centre. RS chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar repeatedly intervened, asking Gokhale to withdraw some of his remarks which the latter refused to do, leading the chair to call for deletion of what it termed ""unparliamentary"" expressions.""MHA feels that the Union govt is the sole representative of the republic and the states don't mean anything. MHA has become a force for battling against states and any person who tries to disagree with the Union govt,"" Gokhale said. He took exception to MHA, though a notification, expanding BSF's patrolling jurisdiction on the border in Bengal and Punjab, and said it marked transgression of the authority of states.He alleged that Bengal was being treated poorly as far as central funds were concerned and that Aparajita Bill passed by West Bengal assembly after brutal rape of a medical student in a Kolkata hospital was still awaiting MHA's approval.As the TMC member alleged that CBI had filed over 6,900 cases in Bengal, Shah pointed out to the chair that the discussion was on MHA and CBI did not come under the ministry. He went on to assert that Gokhale was misleading the House by giving wrong information and said not all CBI cases the TMC member referred to were corruption cases. ""Many of them were related to poll violence registered at the instance of Supreme Court and HC. Victims had approached courts after state govt took no action on their complaints,"" he said.","The discussion on the working of the home ministry in Rajya Sabha on Wednesday took a fiery turn. treasury benches strongly protested ""objectionable"" remarks made by TMC member Saket Gokhale.

He claims his daughter was ""brutally raped and murdered"" and alleges a politically-driven cover-up to shield influential figures.His lawyer, Nilesh Ojha, stated that while the petition was in the process of being filed, it would be numbered at the high court registry department on Thursday.The plea argues that the Mumbai Police ""hastily closed the case as a suicide or accidental death"" without thoroughly examining forensic evidence , circumstantial proof, and eyewitness accounts.

The Mumbai Police registered it as an Accidental Death Report (ADR) at the time. Just days later, on June 14, 2020, Sushant Singh Rajput was found dead in his Bandra apartment.
