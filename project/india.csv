Poll Should politicians maintain a level of decorum towards public servants? Yes, it's crucial for respect. No, they can express their frustration.

NEW DELHI: Karnataka ASP NV Baramani has opted for voluntary retirement, months after chief minister Siddaramaiah publicly humiliated him with a slap gesture during a rally in Belagavi.Baramani, in a letter dated June 12, said that he was ""submitting voluntary retirement due to humiliation by the chief minister.""""On April 28, opposing the central government's price hike policy, a protest meeting was organized by the Congress party under the leadership of Mr Siddaramaiah, the Honorable chief minister of Karnataka, in Belgaum.

Several ministers of the state government, as well as state and national-level leaders, addressed the gathering from the stage. Subsequently, Mr Siddaramaiah, the Honorable chief minister of Karnataka, began his speech addressing the protest program,"" it added.Baramani said that he felt ""deeply humiliated"" after the incident, which caused him ""severe mental trauma.""""I felt deeply humiliated. For a moment, I wanted to confront the Chief Minister and say that what he did was wrong.But I refrained, understanding the potential public embarrassment it could cause. I chose silence. This incident was widely reported in national media and circulated heavily on social media.

Bihar elections: Tensions in NDA? Jitan Ram Manjhi warns Chirag Paswan over past 'mistakes',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-elections-tensions-in-nda-jitan-ram-manjhi-warns-chirag-paswan-over-past-mistakes/articleshow/122232936.cms,"‘It’s Up To Them’ Owaisi Ready To Join Mahagathbandhan In Bihar Elections, Says NDA Must Go

NEW DELHI: Are the NDA allies growing wary of Chirag Paswan? Speculation is swirling after Union minister and Hindustani Awam Morcha chief Jitan Ram Manjhi warned that the Lok Janshakti Party leader would face consequences if he repeated his 2020 assembly poll strategy.Asked whether Chirag was trying to build pressure on the NDA over seat-sharing ahead of the year-end Bihar elections , Manjhi said, ""You saw what happened in 2020. He had to face the consequences of what he did. If he does the same again, the outcome will be similar. Bihar now has a double-engine government under Narendra Modi and Nitish Kumar.""Praising the current NDA administration, Manjhi said progress had been made across sectors including roads, electricity, law and order, and governance.Chirag Paswan, however, chose not to escalate the matter and responded diplomatically: ""Jitan Ram Manjhi is like a father to me. Even if he says something harsh, I will accept it with respect. If the Opposition tries to project this as a rift in the alliance, they will fail.""The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) used the episode to take a swipe at the NDA. Party MP Manoj Jha said, “Sometimes they say one thing, sometimes another, and sometimes it’s all in gestures—but the intent is clear.This is their internal matter. The script of such differences is often written in the Delhi darbar.”In the 2020 assembly elections, Chirag Paswan’s LJP fielded candidates in 137 seats but won only one. However, by splitting the anti-BJP vote, particularly in JD(U) strongholds, the LJP is widely seen to have contributed to the JD(U)’s poor performance. The BJP ended up winning 74 seats, overtaking JD(U)'s 43, and emerged as the senior partner in Bihar for the first time.The assembly election is scheduled for the end of the year, where a high-stakes battle is expected. The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) — consisting of the Janata Dal (United) led by Bihar CM Nitish Kumar and the Bharatiya Janata Party — will face off against the Mahagathbandhan, which includes the Congress, RJD, and Left parties.","Chirag Paswan's LJP fielded candidates in 137 seats but won only one.

The minority community should understand we are not fighting against them. We are fighting against the forces that shove stones in their boys' hands. We want to replace thosestones with books. We want to replace the swords in their hands with pens,"" he said.Bhattacharya's line contrasts sharply with the shrill anti-Muslim pitch adopted by his BJP colleague and assembly opposition leader Suvendu Adhikari, and comes after his party's abject defeat in Kaliganj assembly bypoll. Kaliganj is a Muslim-majority constituency in Nadia. BJP was the only party that saw its vote share dip (from 31% in 2021 to 28.2% now), prompting TMC to emphasise how BJP had failed to hold on to even its majority community votes. It remains to be seen whether Bhattacharya's party colleagues keep up their anti-Muslim pitch even as he takes a conciliatory approach, which would indicate the party has hit on a good cop-bad cop strategy with Bengal's approximately 2.5 crore Muslim voters.""Look at Bengal's villages. Morchhe Musalman, marchhe Musalman (Muslims are killing and Muslims are dying). Who is responsible for this situation? Those who do not like BJP may not vote for us. But they should accept that 90% of the people killed in the last three years have been Muslims,"" he said.""BJP wants visarjan and Muharram processions to walk side by side without any malice against each other. We do not want riots. We want the minority youth to know Bengal through the eyes of Syed Mujtaba Ali and Kazi Nazrul Islam, not terrorists.

PATNA/NEW DELHI: Allies in governing NDA have backed EC's ongoing special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar, describing the exercise as ""routine and necessary"".

They added that they are holding review meetings with booth level agents (BLAs) to assess the situation, and as of now there has been no problem.HAM (Hindustan Avam Morcha) founder Jitan Ram Manjhi and LJP (Lok Janshakti Party) boss Chirag Paswan, both Union ministers, came out strongly in support of EC's exercise.The stand of the allies is significant in view of opposition's allegation that the poll commission's drive is aimed at disenfranchising Dalits and most backward castes. While Dalits are the mainstay of LJP and HAM, JDU draws its support from MBCs and sections of OBCs.Paswan Thursday accused the opposition of deliberately undermining constitutional institutions. ""After EVMs, they are trying to blame SIR as they see defeat staring them in the face in the state election,"" he said.Manjhi echoed this, claiming bogus voter registrations had long benefited the opposition. ""I know many seats where up to 20,000 bogus voters were registered before 2005. Opposition wants to continue with it to their advantage.

GURGAON: The city could play host to India's Disneyland amusement park, chief minister Nayab Singh Saini has said, unveiling ambitious plans to develop areas off the Western Peripheral (KMP) Expressway as tourist destinations.Saini said govt was in talks with officials from Disney and has identified 500 acres of land near Pachgaon Chowk in Manesar for the project. A Disneyland in NCR will be ""game-changing"", the CM said, after meeting Union culture and tourism minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat in Delhi on Wednesday.He said the entertainment hub will bring economic, cultural and social benefits, not only to the state, but the country too. ""The project will generate thousands of direct and indirect employment opportunities and bring major changes to the area. It will attract international tourists too,"" Saini said.Gurgaon, he said, was chosen as the site for the park as many Fortune 500 companies are headquartered in the NCR city, and it gives the state most of its revenue.""The upcoming Global City project in Gurgaon will be another milestone for the region.Hence, Gurgaon is the most suitable location for Disneyland. The site in Manesar is strategically located along KMP Expressway and Haryana Orbital Rail Corridor (HORC). People from across NCR can easily visit,"" Saini said.The Global City project is a 1,000-acre mini-city that the state govt plans to build across sectors 36, 36B, 37 and 37B. Apart from links to the Delhi-Gurgaon and Dwarka expressways, the project will be based on a walk-to-work concept, and all facilities and services will be easily available.Separately, Haryana govt is planning to expand the scale of International Gita Mahotsav, an annual event in Kurukshetra, and organise three melas, instead of one, at Surajkund every year.""Considering the popularity of the Surajkund Mela, govt is planning to organise a Diwali mela and a book fair at Surajkund as well… We have also sought support from the Union tourism ministry and the central govt to organise Gita Mahotsav on a grand scale,"" he said.The CM added, ""Together, these projects will firmly establish Haryana as a tourism hub.""Disneyland, if it goes ahead, will be the first to be built in collaboration with the animation giant in India.Earlier this Feb, the Maharashtra govt had announced plans to develop a park inspired by the Disneyland theme in Navi Mumbai.In 1989, then Haryana CM Om Prakash Chautala had proposed to set up Disneyland in Gurgaon but the project was eventually shelved amid opposition by other political parties and farmers whose land would have to be acquired.INLD national president Abhay Singh Chautala said on Thursday BJP must explain its change in stand on establishing Disneyland in the city.

Race for top posts: UP BJP chief or national president?

LUCKNOW: With the BJP brass expediting the process to elect chiefs of party's state units, discussions and debates over the next UP BJP chief have intensified among the party functionaries. The question though is whether the appointment will be done before the election of the BJP national president.The jury in UP BJP is divided.One section of BJP functionaries, whom TOI spoke to, cited the possibility of UP BJP chief being appointed before the election of the national president. However, another section said since the election of UP BJP head will not be a lone development, the process could be deferred and taken up after the election of the BJP national chief.They said the election of state party chief will be deferred because along with changes in the organisation the Yogi cabinet too could be reshuffled. Since the process is interlinked and might need some brainstorming, the state unit chief election will take time, they added.A BJP functionary said there is still time to elect the national president since the monsoon session of Parliament will begin after two weeks - the time frame set by the party to pick its national head.However, a senior BJP functionary told TOI that time is running out to choose the UP BJP chief since the process will take at least four days. He said the party will have to publish the list of voters after calling for objections, etc.This will take at least two days, he said, adding that once the list is published, only then the nomination for the UP BJP chief will begin. A day after the nomination, observer Piyush Goyal would announce the new BJP chief. Before that, a date for the election of the new BJP chief would be announced, followed by the publishing of the voters' list at the BJP office, the BJP functionary said.Voters in the election of UP BJP chief include one member from each assembly, who are called ""prantiya parshads"" in the BJP, and 20% of the total sitting MLAs and MPs. These prantiya parshads have been elected along with the district BJP chiefs. This means that prantiya parshads from 70 organisational districts have been elected. The number of these parshads from 70 organisational districts would be over 300. District chiefs would also be present when the election of the state BJP chief takes place but will not have voting rights, the BJP leader said.Rather than who will be the new BJP chief, the question now is when will the new UP BJP chief be appointed. The second question is whether the state unit will see only changes at the organisational level or both in the organisation and govt simultaneously.Since UP will go to Assembly polls in 2027, rejig in the organisation and govt will be done keeping this in mind.",BJP brass expediting process to elect chiefs of party's state units.
