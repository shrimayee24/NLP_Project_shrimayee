""The Janata Dal (United) and Nitish Kumar do not need your certificate of secularism. Your secularism is about dividing the society for votes,"" he said, targeting opposition parties.Participating in the debate, LJP (Ram Vilas) MP Arun Bharti said the bill is aimed at transparency and accountability.

PM Modi fulfills Lalu Yadav's wish on strict Waqf law: Amit Shah

Lalu's 2010 video resurfaces on social media

INDI alliance pushback

Government defends the bill

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah invoked an old statement by RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav while defending the Waqf Amendment Bill 2025 in the Lok Sabha. Shah said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had fulfilled Yadav’s 2013 demand for stricter laws to prevent misuse of Waqf properties .""When amendments to the Waqf were introduced in 2013, Lalu Yadav said he wanted a strict law and wanted to put those in jail who were stealing. PM Narendra Modi has fulfilled his wishes,"" Shah remarked during the debate on the bill, which has triggered strong opposition from the RJD and other INDI alliance members.Shah also accused the Congress of ""committing the sin"" in 2013 by barring those whose land was taken for Waqf from seeking legal recourse.""If land is purchased for a temple, the collector verifies its ownership. So why object to the collector determining whether Waqf land belongs to the government?"" he questioned.Shah further said, ""Temples, churches, and gurdwaras have been built, but not on government land. Where Waqf is declared, only the collector has the authority to decide if the land is state-owned.""As opposition parties resisted the bill, an old video of Yadav from May 7, 2010, resurfaced, showing him voicing concerns over alleged land encroachments linked to the Waqf Board. In the clip, Yadav is heard saying, ""Look, there should be a very strict law. All the land has been grabbed—whether government land, private land, or that of workers. Prime land near Patna’s Dak Bungalow has been turned into apartments. Everyone has looted. Pass the amendment today, but future processes must be strict.""The video, shared by Bihar Deputy CM Samrat Choudhary, has stirred political debate, with BJP leaders pointing to an apparent contradiction in RJD’s stance.RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav strongly opposed the bill, calling it unconstitutional. “BJP wants to impose ‘Nagpur ka kanoon.’ We believe in ‘Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb’ and will continue to oppose this bill,” he told ANI.Former Bihar CM Jitan Ram Manjhi, however, urged the opposition to reconsider, highlighting Yadav’s past statements supporting stricter Waqf laws. “Some are opposing it only because Modi’s government is bringing it,” Manjhi posted on X.Union minister Kiren Rijiju, who introduced the bill, said it aims to improve transparency in Waqf property management. He argued that past amendments gave the Waqf Act undue power over other laws. ""If not for this amendment, even Parliament could have been claimed as Waqf property,"" Rijiju claimed.Amit Shah further clarified that Waqf is a charitable endowment and government properties cannot be donated. ""Waqf councils and boards will now ensure that those exploiting properties are caught,"" he said.The bill, renamed the Unified Waqf Management Empowerment, Efficiency and Development (UMEED) Bill, is facing a heated debate as it moves forward in Parliament.",Amit Shah invoked an old statement by RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav while defending the Waqf Amendment Bill 2025 in the Lok Sabha.

""Minorities are now being forced to prove their religious identity with certificates from govt. Tomorrow, will people from other faiths also have to do this?"" he questioned .""What message you want to send out? Which community you want to taint?
