PUNE: Even as many sitting MLAs across Maharashtra face anti-incumbency, there are 12 who have managed to win their seats for more than five consecutive terms, including three who remained undefeated seven times in a row from the same constituency. At least 11 are back in the poll arena.Late PWPI leader Ganpatrao Deshmukh was the longest-serving MLA in Maharashtra’s history, as he was elected to the state assembly for 11 consecutive terms from Sangola. Among the current serving MLAs in the state, Congress MLA Balasaheb Thorat is the senior-most, who won the Sangamner seat for eight consecutive terms since 1985 and is now eyeing to win it for the ninth time.Other MLAs who remained undefeated in their constituencies for a longer period include Dilip Walse Patil from Ambegaon and Jayant Patil from Islampur, who won for seven consecutive terms since 1990. Deputy CM Ajit Pawar also won all assembly elections from Baramati after he first won a by-election here in 1991. Babanrao Shinde, the former MLA of NCP (undivided), who won from Madha constituency for six consecutive terms, is not contesting the election this time. His son Ranjit Shinde is in the fray as an independent.There are also five legislators who remained undefeated in their respective constituencies since 1995, while three more have not lost any assembly poll since 1990. When asked about how he manages to defeat anti-incumbency, Balasaheb Thorat said, “The most important thing is to have a clear vision, and one should sincerely work hard for it.”","There are 12 MLAs who have won their seats for more than five consecutive terms.

MUMBAI: For the minority Christian community in Maharashtra, the election offers difficult choices, especially after home minister Amit Shah’s statement that a BJP govt in the state will implement the anti-conversion law and never allow quota for minorities. Despite the fact that no Christian candidate has been fielded by major political parties in Mumbai, community leaders are advising members to vote in large numbers on Nov 20.Cyril Dara, core member of a federation of NGOs named Samast Christi Samaj, said, “Christians are targeted by anti-conversion laws, which create an environment where conversion to a minority religion is very dangerous, and sharing the gospel can lead to persecution.”Bishop Allwyn D’Silva, in-charge of the social apostolate of the Archdiocese, echoed the need to “vote in parties that respect the Constitution”. “We must invoke the conscience of people regarding issues like communal tension, worsening economic inequality, lack of jobs, and multiple injustices like the anti-conversion bill.”Herbert Barretto, president, Maharashtrian East Indian Christian Federation, said, “The community is unhappy with Congress, NCP and both Shiv Senas for ignoring our members during distribution of tickets.”Melwyn Fernandes of AOCC also expressed hurt over the “exclusion of Christian candidates from Congress party’s list” despite its claims of “secularism, and the community’s loyalty”.Fr Frazer Mascarenhas SJ, an educational administrator and Catholic priest, said, “In these elections, Christians are more interested in voting because of increasing violence against different groups, apparent breakdown of law and order, and abuse of laws like UAPA and PMLA. Other factors include economic distress, lack of jobs, hate speeches and the deterioration of democratic institutions like media, even judiciary, as in the case of Prof Saibaba and Fr Stan Swamy.”","Despite the fact that no Christian candidate has been fielded by major political parties in Mumbai, community leaders are advising members to vote in large numbers on Nov 20.

NAGPUR: As Maharashtra gears up for assembly elections, data reveals a stark under representation of Muslim candidates who make up only about 10% of the total contestants, according to the state’s election department. Of 4,136 candidates vying for seats in 288 constituencies, only 420 are Muslims, and more than half of these are running as independents.Major parties have fielded relatively few. Congress has put forth only nine Muslim candidates, while BJP has fielded none. However, NCP led by Ajit Pawar has given tickets to five, deviating from ally BJP’s approach.Asaduddin Owaisi’s AIMIM has fielded the highest number of Muslim candidates among the parties, with 16, while smaller parties account for 150. Of the 420 Muslim candidates, 218 are running as independents.A TOI analysis of the data found that over 150 constituencies do not have a single Muslim candidate, while nearly 50 constituencies have just one in the race. The numbers thin out even further in many areas, though five constituencies are deviations, featuring seven Muslim candidates each.Malegaon Central stands as an exception to the state’s broader trends, as all its 13 candidates are Muslims. Aurangabad East also has a higher-than-average number of minority candidates — 17 of the 29 contesting in this seat are Muslim, three of whom are women.Across Maharashtra, Muslim women are severely underrepresented, making up only 22 of the total candidate pool. This means that roughly .5% of all candidates are Muslim women. Out of 288 constituencies, 270 do not have even one Muslim woman candidate, whether independent or party-affiliated.According to former state cabinet minister Anees Ahemad, the financial demands of elections make it “out of reach for most middle-class candidates, particularly from minority communities”. He said: “We need to encourage minority women to step forward, but the high cost often holds them back.”","Of 4,136 candidates vying for seats in 288 constituencies, only 420 are Muslims.

Book Rahul & Kharge for bid to mislead electorate: BJP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/book-rahul-kharge-for-bid-to-mislead-electorate-bjp/articleshow/115196449.cms,"Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi

NEW DELHI: Ahead of the Maharashtra polls, BJP has approached EC, accusing Congress MP Rahul Gandhi and Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge of violating the model code of conduct (MCC). On November 6, during a rally in Maharashtra, Gandhi made “objectionable” statements, BJP said in its formal complaint on Monday.The BJP’s complaint highlights what it describes as “gross violations” of the MCC and relevant electoral laws, emphasising that Gandhi’s comments reflect a “malicious and slanderous campaign” against the party. The complaint specifically accuses Gandhi of spreading false information about BJP and its ideological parent, RSS.According to BJP, Gandhi claimed that BJP and RSS intend to “erase” the Constitution. Additionally, Gandhi reportedly alleged that only members of RSS can qualify for high-ranking university positions, disregarding other qualifications.BJP requested EC to “reprimand, censure and restrain Gandhi from handing out lies” from making further statements during the campaigning that BJP considers unfounded. The party also sought an FIR against Kharge and Gandhi for what it views as a persistent campaign to mislead the electorate.The complaint argues “Gandhi with his statements is inciting youths of Maharashtra which is immensely dangerous for the unity and integrity of the nation”.Among the statements flagged, Gandhi allegedly claimed that industries like Apple and Boeing are relocating operations to other states at Maharashtra’s expense, a claim the BJP calls “unverified” and “misleading”.BJP carrying out vicious communal propaganda: CongressAccusing the governing BJP of vicious communal propaganda in Jharkhand and Maharashtra, Congress Monday said the Election Commission has accepted the party’s complaints about specific instances of campaign violations and ordered FIRs to be lodged. The party demanded that BJP be censured if the communal advertisements continue in the future.A Congress delegation met EC with eight complaints, and claimed that the poll watchdog accepted all its eight petitions as valid and initiated proceedings to redress the grievances. The EC later in a statement said, that an FIR has been registered for posting false and misleading videos on ‘BJ Jharkhand’ social media platform.Lok Sabha MP Sasikanth Senthil, who led the Congress team, said the party told the watchdog that there is a pattern in the communal propaganda through social media posts by the BJP, which happens even without elections, and the only objective is to divide society for political advantage. “It is way beyond what the country is used to. We told EC that if this is repeated, then there should be strong strictures against this party,” he added.Senthil said while the advertisements in Jharkhand social media were very communal, the one on the official party handle in Maharashtra showed a Congress leader and a community in very bad light. He added that EC ordered that the advertisements and posts be taken down and also ordered police cases to be filed. Also, Congress said it repeated the earlier complaint that a governor (Raghubar Das) is involved in the political campaign in Jharkhand. “The ECI promised to take cognisance and order a probe,” the party added.","BJP has approached EC, accusing Congress MP Rahul Gandhi and Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge of violating the model code of conduct (MCC) On November 6, during a rally in Maharashtra, Gandhi made “objectionable” statements, BJP said in its formal complaint on Monday.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115196459,imgsize-56314,width-400,resizemode-4/115196459.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday castigated the AAP govt in Punjab for its “lame excuses” to delay elections to grassroots level governance institutions — municipal corporations, municipal councils and nagar panchayats — even though the five-year tenure of most of the 42 such bodies expired years ago.“Non-holding of elections since 2020 is a serious lapse. Your affidavit before the (Punjab and Haryana) high court is full of lame excuses. These are all false and baseless reasons given by the Punjab govt for not holding elections. Hold elections or face action,” warned a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Ujjal Bhuyan.Senior advocate A M Singhvi attempted to diffuse the situation by telling the bench that the state cannot escape holding elections, but sought time till Dec 31 to initiate the process as the delimitation exercise had to be carried out. The fresh delimitation process initiated by the state govt was quashed by the HC.When advocate general Gurminder Singh pitched in to say that without delimitation several villages would be deprived of voting, the bench said, “We hope the state govt understands the mandate of Article 243U that warrants completion of the elections to the civic bodies before expiry of its five-year tenure. The ground of delimitation is not available to the state to defer elections, as has been laid down by two SC judgements.”The bench also expressed surprise as to how the state election commission is a co-petitioner with the Punjab govt in the appeal against the HC judgement. “Where is the independence of the EC,” the bench said and directed the state election commission and the Punjab govt to issue notification for civic body elections within two weeks and complete the process, including declaration of results, within eight weeks of issuance of the notification.The bench said only three out of 42 civic bodies have an elected body. “When the constitutional mandate is to hold elections prior to expiry of the five-year tenure, the state is seeing ghosts and not holding elections for the last four years. These are serious lapses,” it said. Elections to the three civic bodies were held in Jan 2023.","The five-year tenure of most of the 42 such bodies expired years ago. “Non- holding of elections since 2020 is a serious lapse.

I was shocked by the content they used to publish during the leadership of Rajiv Gandhi.

RANCHI: Union home minister Amit Shah accused chief minister Hemant Soren ’s coalition govt of patronising illegal Bangladeshi immigrants in Jharkhand for vote-bank politics , while pledging that the BJP would bring a law to prevent the transfer of land to all infiltrators who marry off tribal girls.“The entire tribal community is against the infiltrators and their atrocities,” he said and promised that BJP, if elected, would reclaim all such land grabbed by illegal immigrants.Earlier, while unveiling BJP’s manifesto for Jharkhand on Nov 3, Home minister Shah had accused illegal Bangladeshi immigrants of grabbing tribal land “by marrying tribal girls through false pretensions”. He had promised that BJP govt “will identify and deport each infiltrator and take back the land they’d usurped from the tribal people”.On the final day of campaigning for the first phase of Jharkhand assembly elections on Nov 13, the Union Home minister addressed two rallies — one at Tamar in Ranchi district and another in Seraikela, both reserved for STs.Shah alleged that the JMM-Cong-RJD alliance is against tribal people as it had unceremoniously removed former chief minister Champai Soren for speaking out against govt policies.“Hemant Soren’s party JMM removed Champai from the CM’s post because he spoke about the illegal infiltration of the Bangladeshis in the state. JMM humiliated Champai by dethroning him for telling the truth.

It argued that the three legislators should not have been invited as “non-Hindus are not allowed entry at the ghat since long, and the British had also made it a rule under the Haridwar Municipal Act of 1935.”The event, held on Monday in the presence of CM Pushkar Singh Dhami and a host of other BJP leaders, featured cultural performances and a light show.

NAGPUR/NASIK: Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray expressed outrage after his bags were checked by officials deployed by EC at Wani, Yavatmal , ahead of a rally Saturday. A video circulated by the party shows Thackeray’s bags being examined, a move he termed “biased” and questioned whether such checks were conducted on PM Modi, Amit Shah, Eknath Shinde or Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar.“I don’t mind if you check my water cans, fuel tank, or even my urine pot,” he said to the officials, “but make sure you’re checking Modi and Shah’s bags as well and send me those videos.” Thackeray questioned why functionaries from his party were subjected to such scrutiny while BJP netas were allegedly not.Responding to Thackeray’s comments, Yavatmal collector Pankaj Ashiya said, “This process is conducted in accordance with EC’s instructions.

Thackeray claimed an official informally mentioned Modi and Shah’s bags were checked previously but said it should be standard practice to verify the bags of all political leaders equally.“If these BJP star campaigners are here only to campaign, they should be treated like any other candidate’s representative,” Thackeray argued. “Justice should be equal for all. Don’t salute them as PM or CM here — they’re here as party campaigners, not as heads of govt.” Thackeray also called on EC to ensure a level playing field, adding if they don’t have the courage to apply the same rules for all leaders, his Shiv Sainiks would conduct the checks themselves.","Uddhav Thackeray's bags were checked by officials deployed by EC at Wani, Yavatmal.

Congress party has openly opposed the quota system and the language they have used for SC/ST/OBC people was clumsy,” the PM said while interacting virtually with BJP volunteers from Jharkhand under the ‘Mera Booth Sabse Majboot’ programme.BJP circulated the Congress advertisement, saying that in 1991, the party was preparing to end reservations meant for SCs, STs and OBCs. “This ad was one such attempt. It exposes their nefarious plans. Recently, during his US visit, Rahul Gandhi again spoke about scrapping reservations. Left to the Congress, there would be no reservations for backwards. Muslims alone will corner all benefits,” BJP IT department head Amit Malviya said in a post on X.Modi said no one dared talk about reservations when Congress was in office. “There was a time when Congress was in power from panchayat to Parliament... then none dared to talk about quota and Congress used to suppress those who demanded it. From Jawaharlal Nehru to Rahul Gandhi, all had opposed reservation in govt jobs. For years, Dalit and Adivasi society was divided until they got the identity as SC and SC. Even OBC people got their due only in 1990,” he said.Modi said people of Jharkhand were determined to bring change. The biggest reason for this, he said, was that JMM, Congress and RJD had attacked Jharkhand’s “roti, beti and maati” — a reference to BJP’s charges of corruption under the JMM-Congress coalition, infiltration of Bangladeshis and the rise in atrocities on women and loss of land belonging to tribals.“They talked big in the last five years, but today the people of Jharkhand are seeing that most of their promises are false,” Modi said.","BJP circulated the Congress advertisement, saying that in 1991, the party was preparing to end reservations meant for SCs, STs and OBCs. “This ad was one such attempt.

RANCHI: Responding to PM Narendra Modi and BJP’s poll slogans “Eh rahoge toh safe rahoge (Stay united and you’ll be safe)” and “Batoge toh katoge (Divided, you’ll be destroyed)”, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge Monday countered with “Daroge toh maroge (If you get scared, you’re dead)”, saying the saffron party and its politicians were trying to polarise voters ahead of the Jharkhand election.In response to the PM’s allegations against the Hemant Soren-led Jharkhand govt, Kharge said, “Modi and his govt are against OBC, SC and ST as they reduced the reservation quota in Jharkhand in the past. Our govt got a resolution passed to increase the reservation limits in the state assembly and sent the proposal to the governor. But the governor is yet to act on the issue.”Kharge, who was addressing a rally in support of Congress candidate Radha Krishan Kishore at Chatterpur and other INDIA bloc alliance candidates in Palamu-Latehar region, also criticised UP CM Yogi Adityanath, saying BJP believes in coming to office by resorting to divisive politics and fear-mongering. “Yogi-ji visited here a few days ago. He is the head of a ‘math’ and wears a dress donned by sadhus. But sadhus must be compassionate and unite people to safeguard humanity. However, he said, ‘Batoge toh katoge’. You must now understand that ‘daroge toh maroge’,” he said.Kharge also said, “(Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma) came here and tried to intimidate locals — those working with Congress or its allies. ‘Lekin hum darne wale nahin hain. Hum darenge to marenge’ (But we can’t be intimidated. If we grow fearful we’ll die).”Kharge said INDIA bloc’s united fight to save democracy and constitutional rights prevented BJP and Modi from getting the required numbers in the Lok Sabha election. “Modi-ji is running a minority govt because of your power. It is because of your fight to save the country. Once again you have to show your power to help our alliance form the state govt to fight such divisive forces.”Hailing the five-year tenure of Hemant government, Kharge said the administration focused on staying united and working for the welfare of the people despite BJP’s attempts to topple the government. “We tried to deliver all promises we made, unlike the jumlas of BJP.”",Mallikarjun Kharge: BJP trying to polarise voters ahead of Jharkhand election.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Monday stayed a Madras HC order transferring to CBI the investigations into repeated sexual assault of a 10-year-old girl on Oct 29, and decided to set up a special investigation team (SIT) to probe the incident while expressing shock over the manner in which state police treated the minor.Appearing for DMK govt in Tamil Nadu , senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi told a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Ujjal Bhuyan that Chennai Police had acted promptly and registered FIRs prior to arresting the accused. However, when the bench said it would constitute an SIT to probe the incident instead of transferring the probe to CBI, the state govt readily agreed.The bench said, prima facie there appears to be mishandling of the case by police, which is likely because of their insensitivity to the survivor. “We aren’t happy with the investigations,” SC said, and asked DMK govt to furnish the names of seven direct recruit IPS officers , who are natives of other states but have opted for TN cadre. “Of the panel of IPS officers, at least three should be women,” it said.“We would like to constitute an SIT to investigate the incident,” the bench said and asked the state to furnish the names of the IPS officers by Nov 18, the next date of hearing. It also said that the state would bear the expenses of litigation and fees of the advocate engaged by the mother of the sexually assaulted minor.Hours later, senior advocate Kapil Sibal requested the bench to pass similar orders in a case from Bengal where HC had ordered CBI probe into the alleged physical torture of two women, who were arrested for instigating an accused to give threats of rape against the minor child of an MP.The bench agreed and stayed Calcutta HC’s orders for CBI probe into the incident but stayed the ongoing probes by Bengal Police into the incident. Following the approach adopted in the TN incident, the bench asked Trinamool govt to furnish a panel of seven IPS officers of WB cadre, who are not inhabitants of the state, of which at least five should be women by Nov 18.On Oct 1, HC ordered CBI probe into the rape case saying though the minor was repeatedly raped, cops harassed the parents & arrested the prime suspect only after 12 days.","Supreme Court stayed a Madras HC order transferring to CBI the investigations into repeated sexual assault of a 10-year-old girl on Oct 29.

People from SC, ST, OBC communities need not worry: Shah

Mahayuti will meet & decide after polls: Shah on CM face

MUMBAI: A very stringent anti-conversion law that will ensure zero religious conversions in Maharashtra will be enacted once the Mahayuti comes to power, promised Union home minister Amit Shah. On Sunday, he released the BJP’s “Sankalp Patra” (election manifesto) in Mumbai, listing 25 promises that the Mahayuti will fulfil if elected to power.Meanwhile, elsewhere in Maharashtra, Shah in his speech made it clear there will be no religion-based reservation for education and employment.The party has been wooing the Hindu community in this election, and the announcement is seen as a concrete attempt to take the party’s election slogans “Batenge toh Katenge (divided we shall be cut), Ek hain toh safe hai (We are safe if we are one)” a step forward. Speaking on the anti-conversion law, Shah said the BJP will form an internal committee to draft the anti-conversion law. “...after the Mahayuti forms the government, it will constitute a committee to hold discussions with all stakeholders. It will come up with very stringent laws so religious conversions do not take place,” said Shah.In Mumbai, Shah said PM Modi brought a bill to improve the Waqf Board, but in Karnataka, attempts were made to evict villages and even temples constructed on Waqf land. “When the opposition says it wants to improve the Waqf Board bill , it means this can happen even in Maharashtra,” he said. Shah addressed a press meet after the event.On who would be the next CM, Shah said after elections, the three parties will sit together and take a decision. On increasing number of family members of party members being given tickets , Shah said the party made attempts to reduce number of such candidates. “There are more family dynasts in MVA,” he said. On a common minimum programme, Shah said the first ten points of Sankalp Patra were of Mahayuti. “Every party will announce its own Sankalp Patra. Once Mahayuti forms govt, a committee of ministers from all three parties will be formed to pritise commitments made and ensure 100% implementation,” he said.Attacking Uddhav Thackeray, he said MVA promises are merely to “grab power”. Urging people to vote for Mahayuti, he said the 2019 people’s mandate was betrayed. “Thackeray should decide where he wants to sit. He is sitting with people who opposed abrogation of Article 370, amendment to CAA, NCR, Ram Mandir construction... I want to ask himif he can appeal to Rahul Gandhi to speak a few good words on Veer Savarkar, can he ask Congress members to say a few good words on Bal Thackeray.”","The party has been wooing the Hindu community in this election.

The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections , which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases. The results will be declared on November 23, along with Maharashtra.In the Tribal-dominated state, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and CM Hemant's Soren Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) are in a direct fight, while the Congress party and Lalu Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) are in alliance with the JMM.The JMM-Congress-RJD alliance are also reportedly seeking to deal with Left parties, Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party and other tribal outfits that have been contesting the elections in the state as independent entities and make efforts to field candidates against the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) on all 81 seats collectively.In the last assembly polls in 2019, the JMM-Congress-RJD alliance won a comfortable majority of 47 seats in a House of 81.The BJP slipped to 25 seats from 37 it held in 2014. The poor performance was perceived to be the outcome of its decision to contest alone backfiring. The party did not foster an alliance with the Ajsu in the 2019 polls when Raghubar Das, currently the Odisha governor, was serving the state as CM.In this year's Lok Sabha polls in Jharkhand, the BJP-led NDA secured nine out of the 14 seats, with the BJP winning eight and its alliance partner, the Ajsu (All Jharkhand Students Union) Party, retaining its single seat.On the other hand, the opposition India bloc improved its tally, increasing its seat count from two in 2019 to five in the parliamentary polls.BJP and JMM have spruced up their pace of campaigning from the ground zero to social media. BJP and JMM leaders are actively rebutting and challenging each other on a range of issues, including illegal immigration, youth welfare, employment and housing.INDIA bloc parties in Jharkhand slammed the EC for holding assembly elections in the state along with that of Maharashtra but claimed that they were ready to slug it out with BJP-led NDA, which has welcomed the announcement of poll dates.JMM, Congress, and CPI (ML-L) said the announcement showed that EC was in a hurry to conduct elections though the assembly tenure was due to end in January next year.Also, both the INDIA bloc and BJP-led NDA are expected to get into huddles to discuss the modalities of seat-sharing which is going to be a challenge for both the competing teams.","The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections, which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra. Elections in Maharashtra will be held in single phase on November 20. The counting of votes will be on November 23.Maharashtra is gearing up for elections as the two major political alliances—the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) and the Mahayuti—prepare to face each other for the first time in a Vidhan Sabha election.The Maha Vikas Aghadi, comprise of the Congress, the Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray), and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) under Sharad Pawar, will go head-to-head with the Mahayuti , which includes the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Shiv Sena faction led by Eknath Shinde, and the NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar. This will be the first electoral contest between these two alliances since the splits within the Shiv Sena and NCP.The MVA is hopeful of replicating its recent Lok Sabha success, while the Mahayuti aims to retain power by leveraging its populist schemes targeted at women and youth. Both alliances have set their sights on winning the state.Narayan Rane, a former Union Minister and the victor in the Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg Lok Sabha constituency, is poised to be a key figure for the BJP in the Konkan region during the forthcoming elections. Meanwhile, two constituencies are expected to be critical battlegrounds: chief minister Eknath Shinde's Kopri-Pachpakdi seat in Thane City and Worli in Mumbai, where Aaditya Thackeray, a leader of the Shiv Sena (UBT), is seeking reelection.In the last Vidhan Sabha elections in 2019, the BJP secured 26.1% of the votes, the Congress 16.1%, the NCP 16.9%, and the Shiv Sena 16.6%. The BJP and the Shiv Sena (then united) formed the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which secured a majority. However, the coalition soon crumbled due to disagreements over government formation, plunging the state into a political crisis.After no party could establish a government, Maharashtra was placed under President's rule. Devendra Fadnavis was briefly sworn in as chief minister, with Ajit Pawar as deputy chief minister. However, both resigned just days later before a scheduled floor test.By November 28, 2019, a new coalition emerged, with the Shiv Sena (Uddhav faction), NCP (Sharad Pawar faction), and Congress forming the Maha Vikas Aghadi government, led by Uddhav Thackeray as chief minister.The state's politics took another turn in June, 2022, when Uddhav Thackeray resigned following a rebellion within the Shiv Sena, led by Eknath Shinde, who then allied with the BJP. Eknath Shinde assumed the role of chief minister, with Devendra Fadnavis returning as deputy chief minister.",The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra.
