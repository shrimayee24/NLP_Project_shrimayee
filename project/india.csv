MADURAI: Years after their political face-off and estrangement, Tamil Nadu CM M K Stalin visited his elder brother and former Union minister M K Alagiri at his house in TVS Nagar in Madurai on Saturday night, soon after concluding his road show in the city.Sources said Alagiri had recently invited Stalin to his house. Accepting the invite, the DMK supremo visited Alagiri's house around 10 pm on Saturday, after several years, and had dinner with his brother and his family.The meeting was a family affair as no ministers accompanied Stalin to Alagiri's house. However, a large number of supporters of Alagiri had gathered in front of his house. They gave a warm reception to the chief minister and presented him with shawls & a 'sengol' (sceptre).This is the second time Stalin has met his brother Alagiri in a long time. He had earlier met his brother in 2024 while visiting his nephew Durai Dayanidhi, who was undergoing treatment at Christian Medical College in Vellore.In 2014, late DMK chief M Karunanidhi had expelled elder son Alagiri from the primary membership for criticising the party and its members. In December 2024, nine Alagiri supporters expelled from DMK in 2014 along with the former Union minister had written a letter to Stalin, seeking his pardon and requesting him to take them back into the party.","Tamil Nadu CM M K Stalin visited his elder brother and former Union minister M K Alagiri at his house in TVS Nagar in Madurai on Saturday night.
