NEW DELHI: The Congress on Thursday criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for seating Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi , in the ""fifth row"" during the Independence Day celebrations at the Red Fort, labeling it as a display of ""pettiness"" and a disregard for democratic norms.Gandhi was observed sitting behind several rows occupied by members of the Indian contingent from the recently concluded Paris Games.It was for the first time in a decade that a Leader of the Opposition was present at Red Fort for the Independence Day celebrations.As per several media reports, officials of the ministry of defence, which organises the event, said the seating was arranged ""according to the table of precedence"", with the decision made to honor ""Paris Olympics medal winners"" as special guests this year.The front rows were occupied by Olympic medallists such as Manu Bhaker and Sarabjot Singh. Members of the Olympic-bronze-winning hockey team, including its captain Harmanpreet Singh and PR Sreejesh, were also seated ahead of Rahul Gandhi.As per protocol, the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, whose rank is equivalent to that of a Cabinet Minister, is always assigned a seat in the front row. The front row was occupied by Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud and Union ministers Nirmala Sitharaman, Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Amit Shah and S Jaishankar.Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate asserted that PM Modi exhibits a ""petty mindset"", consistently revealing this aspect of his character.""It is pointless to expect significant actions from small-minded individuals. Modi's decision to place Rahul Gandhi in the fifth row during the Independence Day event reflects his frustration, but it does not deter Gandhi from addressing the people's concerns,"" she stated in a video on X.""However, this act underscores a lack of respect for democracy, democratic traditions, and the Leader of the Opposition,"" she added.Shrinate emphasised that the Leader of the Opposition holds a rank equivalent to a cabinet minister, while government ministers occupied the front row.""Not only was Rahul Gandhi relegated to the fifth row, but Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge was also assigned to the same row,"" she noted.She criticized the defense ministry's justification for the seating arrangement , which claimed it was intended to honor Olympians, questioning why prominent leaders like Amit Shah, J P Nadda, S Jaishankar, and Nirmala Sitharaman were not also recognized.""The Leader of the Opposition is crucial for holding the government accountable and voicing public issues,"" Shrinate stated.""These individuals with a petty mindset disregard democracy and its traditions,"" she alleged.She further claimed that Modi and his ministers are uneasy with Gandhi's inquiries.""Whether Rahul Gandhi is seated in the fifth row or the fiftieth, he will always be a leader for the people. When will you cease these disgraceful actions?"" she remarked on X.Congress leader Vivek Tankha echoed this sentiment, questioning Modi's pettiness in a post on X, emphasizing that the Leader of the Opposition should be seated higher than any cabinet minister.","Gandhi was observed sitting behind several rows occupied by members of the Indian contingent from the recently concluded Paris Games.

MUMBAI: In a fresh tiff between Congress and Shiv Sena (UBT) over the CM face of the Maha Vikas Aghadi for the assembly polls, Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut on Tuesday said that if Congress has a face for the CM's post, then they should make it public.Raut was responding to state Congress chief Nana Patole 's statement that if Sharad Pawar or Uddhav Thackeray make a statement regarding the CM face, they (Congress) would take it seriously, else there is no need to talk about anyone else making claims.Last week, former CM Prithviraj Chavan of Congress said there was a tradition in Maharashtra that in an alliance , the party which wins more seats gets the post of CM and the decision on who will be CM is taken by the top brass of that party.

It is expected that the meeting will provide clarity for the MVA to kickstart joint election work at the ground level.Earlier, Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut said that there would be a Thackeray-2 government after the elections. However, former CM and Congress leader Prithviraj Chavan had noted that there is a tradition in Maharashtra where the party in an alliance that wins more seats gets the CM's post.Taking a dig at Congress, Raut added that there were many in Congress eyeing the CM post, including some former CMs, but if their party has any candidate in mind, they should declare it.On Thursday, reacting to reports that Uddhav Thackeray is likely to be appointed as the Aghadi's campaign chief, Raut told a TV news channel that it was similar to there being a “need for a hero to fight with a villain in cinema.” He added, “Uddhav Thackeray is our party face, and he worked hard campaigning for MVA candidates during the Lok Sabha elections.”Uddhav's rival and chief minister Eknath Shinde stated that since Uddhav had abandoned Shiv Sena founder Balasaheb Thackeray’s ideology, it did not matter if he was appointed ""campaign head or to any other post.Our Ladki Bahin (a reference to the Mukhya Mantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana, a flagship scheme of the Shinde-led government) will not listen to them.”A Sena (UBT) leader said Uddhav commands a good reputation and has the sympathy factor going for him, so it would help if he is the face of the MVA alliance.","The Maha Vikas Aghadi ( MVA ) leadership is likely to appoint former chief minister Uddhav Thackeray as the campaign chief for the assembly elections.
