Congress silent on Uddhav’s demand

NAGPUR: In his bid to reclaim the hardline Hindutva turf after being accused of abandoning the party's core ideology, Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday questioned BJP on why the nation's highest civilian honour, Bharat Ratna , was still not bestowed on Veer Savarkar . He was talking to reporters in Nagpur after attending the winter session of the legislature on Tuesday.""When Devendra Fadnavis was CM, he had written to PM Modi with a request to bestow the honour on Savarkar. Even today he's the CM and his demand has not been considered. Then BJP has no right to speak on Savarkar. I reiterate my demand that the nation's highest honour be given to Savarkar,"" he said.Thackeray also called upon BJP and Congress to move beyond historical debates surrounding Jawaharlal Nehru and Vinayak Savarkar and urged them to focus on critical development issues plaguing the nation. ""Both Nehru and Savarkar are historical figures who made their contributions. Today, what we need is a focus on development, addressing farmers' issues, improving infrastructure, and resolving unemployment,"" he said.Uddhav also met and congratulated CM Devendra Fadnavis in the latter's office at the legislature premises in Nagpur. Sena (UBT)'s Aaditya Thackeray, Anil Parab, Varun Sardesai and Ambadas Danve also congratulated Fadnavis on the poll win. Later, Uddhav and Fadnavis had a closed-door meeting which lasted around 10-15 minutes, Sena (UBT) functionaries said. Uddhav also met speaker Rahul Narwekar. After the meetings, there was speculation that the leader of opposition's post could be given to Sena (UBT), which is the single largest opposition party with 20 MLAs. This was Uddhav's first meeting with Fadnavis after the assembly polls which saw a bitter war of words between the two.Uddhav said, ""I have the expectation of a cultured political atmosphere in Maharashtra. We could not win the polls, they won the polls and have formed the govt. Naturally, we expect this govt to work in the interest of the state and take decisions for the benefit of the state. The rest of the questions on the results are there in the minds of people. We will keep raising our voice about that.""Aaditya said, ""We met CM Fadnavis. We want to have cultured politics and work in the interest of the state for the next five years. So we congratulated them. We have political differences, but there is no personal enmity.""Uddhav Thackeray’s demand for Bharat Ratna for Savarkar was met with silence from Congress on Tuesday. Till late evening, Congress had not reacted to the politically sensitive faultline among the allies. Thackeray’s demand came barely days after Congress MP Rahul Gandhi in Lok Sabha criticised Savarkar for his views on the Constitution, and for having apologised to the British.","Congress silent on Uddhav’s demand for Bharat Ratna for Veer Savarkar.

Govt introduces ONOE bills in Lok Sabha; opposition says numbers won't add up to pass them,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-introduces-onoe-bills-in-lok-sabha-opposition-says-numbers-wont-add-up-to-pass-them/articleshow/116413042.cms,"Lok Sabha MPs give voice vote on the ‘one nation, one election’ bill during the winter session of Parliament in New Delhi on Tuesday.

ONOE bills assault statute's basic structure, says Congress

NEW DELHI: The Centre on Tuesday introduced two bills in Lok Sabha - the Constitution (129th Amendment) Bill and the Union Territories Amendment Bill, 2024 - to change laws for holding simultaneous elections of Lok Sabha and state assemblies along with UTs amid massive uproar from the opposition parties , underlining the challenge Modi govt would face to synchronise polls.In the 90-minute debate, the opposition claimed the 'one nation, one election' (ONOE) plan was against the spirit of federalism and exceeded the legislative competence of Parliament and was part of a conspiracy to bring in dictatorship by stealth. Govt defended the effort saying it is 41 years since Election Commission recommended clubbing of polls and said the two bills would be referred to a joint committee of Parliament for scrutiny.A vote on whether the bill should be introduced saw the ruling side prevailing with a 263-198 score despite the glaring absence of 20 members, including ministers, from BJP . The opposition pointed out that govt did not have the two-thirds majority required for LS to clear the bill.But the margin paled before the ask of the support of 362 - two -third of the 543-strong House laid down for the passage of a constitutional amendment bill. Although successive govts have managed to rustle up numbers in excess of their actual squad, the gap between the actual and the desirable is too big and would require extraordinary effort.BJP does not have adequate numbers to meet the two-third threshold in Rajya Sabha either - 121 against the 167 needed in the House with a total strength, inclusive of the 12 nominated members, of 250.This was pointed out by Congress's Shashi Tharoor to predict that the bill was destined to be defeated. ""Undoubtedly, govt has larger numbers on its side... but to pass it (bills to amend the Constitution), you need a two-thirds majority that they very clearly don't have,"" he said. Significantly, govt on its own referred the bills, introduced by law minister Arjun Meghwal, to a joint parliamentary panel for detailed scrutiny. Home minister Amit Shah said PM Modi had favoured referring the bills to a joint committee of Parliament for wider deliberations at every level. ""Detailed discussions can take place in the JPC. The report of the JPC will be approved by the Cabinet and Parliament will get to discuss the bills,"" Shah said, urging the agitated opposition MPs to calm down. ""When this bill was being discussed in the Cabinet, the PM himself suggested referring it to a JPC,"" he said. Meghwal said: ""There have been multiple discussions on the issue. On June 19, 2019, a meeting was held by the Prime Minister on holding simultaneous elections in which 19 political parties participated. Of them, 16 supported the move while three others opposed it.""""One of the essential features is federalism and the structure of our democracy. The bills assault the basic structure of the Constitution and exceed the legislative competence of this House,"" Congress MP Manish Tewari said and demanded that the bills be withdrawn.Samajwadi Party MP Dharmendra Yadav said the measure was an attempt to bring dictatorship in the country. ""Two days ago, govt was swearing by the principles of the Constitution. Now, they want to finish the federal structure which is a core principle of the Constitution,"" Yadav said.TMC's Kalyan Banerjee said the move wasn't aimed at election reform but to fulfil the desires of a single person. DMK's T R Baalu and Anil Desai from Shiv Sena (UBT) also opposed the govt decision to introduce the two bills. NCP (SP)'s Supriya Sule favoured referring the bills to a parliamentary committee, if they could not be withdrawn. ""This bill is aimed at maximising political gain and convenience. This bill will finish off regional parties,""AIMIM's Asaduddin Owaisi said.BJP allies TDP and Shiv Sena, extended ""unwavering support"" to the election reform measure.Congress's Priyanka Gandhi Vadra rejected the bill as ""anti-constitutional"".

He also said that Congress never respected Ambedkar either who had to quit the Nehru cabinet due to serious differences over issues like Article 370.Congress' continuing invocation of Ambedkar was a sham as they never respected him, Shah said.

""This was the biggest-ever fraud perpetrated. It may have worked in LS polls but now people have seen through it and that is why Congress suffered a rout in Maharashtra,"" he said.Taking on Congress over its claim to be the defender of the Constitution, he said that a momentous decision like the imposition of Emergency was taken through a demi-official note and by bypassing the Cabinet.

He called the act not only troubling but a direct insult to the historical significance of the event, urging the central government to ""immediately"" return the photograph to its original location.""This action is part of a disturbing trend observed in recent years, where similar efforts to alter or erase India's original history have been reported across various ministries, monuments, and defense establishments.
