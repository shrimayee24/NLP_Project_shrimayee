2026 Tamil Nadu election a direct fight between TVK & DMK: Vijay,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2026-tn-election-a-direct-fight-between-tvk-dmk-vijay/articleshow/123442609.cms,"MADURAI: TVK chief Vijay on Thursday positioned himself as the alternative to “Stalin uncle” saying the 2026 assembly election would be a straight fight between his party and DMK.In a fiery 34-minute speech at TVK’s second state conference at Parapathi, Madurai, Vijay accused DMK of hypocrisy. “You ask women to call you appa (father), but there is no safety for women themselves,” he said addressing Stalin, before asking the crowd if DMK had fulfilled its promises. As they shouted “no,” he said, “Stalin uncle, hear the noise of the people.”On DMK’s approach to BJP, Vijay accused the ruling party of shifting positions. “When in opposition, they flew black balloons against Modi. Now, as the ruling party, they welcome him. Whenever ED raids take place, they rush to Delhi and the raids fade away. Stalin uncle, what uncle? It is very wrong uncle,” he said, and the gathered cadres burst into laughter.The TVK chief also posed pointed questions to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, asking whether he had come to power for the third time “to do good for the people or to plot something against the Muslim community”.He pressed Centre to retrieve Katchatheevu island, withdraw NEET and resolve the plight of “around 800 fishermen” arrested by the Sri Lankan Navy. He accused BJP of hiding facts about the Keeladi excavations and depending on “alliance partners without real people power” to extend its rule till 2029.Without naming AIADMK, Vijay said BJP was using the party once nurtured by M G Ramachandran as a “backdoor to enter Tamil Nadu”. He said that even that party’s cadres were upset with their present state.TVK, he said, would be a “truly secular party” that would never have any hidden tie-up with BJP. He added that alliances under TVK would give equal power to partners.Indirectly addressing critics, Vijay said, “A lion comes to the ground only to hunt, not to pass time. Even if it is single, it will be the king of the jungle. It is not just a description but a clear declaration.” He greeted his cadres as “lion cubs” and described TVK as an “army of common people.”Vijay said TVK had already created “ripples” in state politics. “Many said I will not enter politics, then that I will not get support, then that I cannot conduct a conference. Now they say I cannot win elections. They also say this crowd may not translate into votes. To those analysts, I say — this crowd is not just support, we have already entered every household in the state.”He emphasised that the safety of women, children and the elderly would be TVK’s top priority, and pledged welfare measures for youth, farmers, labourers, weavers, fisherfolk, the disabled, elderly and transpersons.Amid cheers, Vijay made a surprise announcement, saying he would contest from Madurai East constituency in 2026. After a short pause, Vijay named all the nine remaining constituencies and asked people to assume that he himself is contesting in all 234 assembly constituencies in the state.In a symbolic gesture, he sang an MGR song from the movie ‘Enga Veetu Pillai’, asking whether people could “take the whip of politics” and use it against both BJP and DMK.Vijay concluded with a parting shot at stereotypes about actors in politics. “Leaders such as Ambedkar, Kamaraj and Nallakannu were defeated by politicians, not by cinema actors. Not all politicians are knowledgeable, and not every actor is an idiot,” he declared, drawing loud applause.","TVK chief Vijay positioned himself as the alternative to ‘Stalin uncle’ He said the 2026 assembly election would be a straight fight between his party and DMK.

AHMEDABAD: Twenty-nine years after then Gujarat minister Atmaram Patel's dhoti was pulled during a BJP function at Sardar Patel Stadium, a city sessions court on Thursday dropped the criminal case against former Union minister A K Patel, one of the two first BJP Lok Sabha members.Another BJP politician, Mangaldas Patel, was also an accused in the case, registered at Naranpura police station under IPC Section 307 (attempt to murder) for allegedly assaulting and pulling off the minister's dhoti in 1996.The accused had backed Shankersinh Vaghela at the time of his rift with then chief minister Keshubhai Patel. The incident occurred immediately after BJP's Atal Bihari Vajpayee had finished addressing the party gathering.Public prosecutor Sudhir Brahmbhatt filed an application under CrPC Section 321 seeking withdrawal of the case against the 95-year-old former MP. The co-accused in the case, Mangaldas Patel, and witness (victim) Atmaram Patel, had passed away during the pendency of the trial.After hearing the submissions, additional sessions judge H G Pandya observed: ""The case involves an internal political party dispute that occurred 28 years ago, and the victim, Atmarambhai Maganbhai Patel, has passed away... The public prosecutor's request to withdraw the case appears to be made with bona fide intentions, and sufficient consideration has been given to withdrawing the prosecution. Therefore, considering the records and the nature of the offence, it is appropriate to grant permission to withdraw the prosecution under Section 321 of CrPC in the interest of justice. ""Earlier, on Jan 30, 2018, a metropolitan court had dropped a related criminal case against 41 BJP workers and politicians, including VHP leader Pravin Togadia and BJP MLA from Daskroi Babu Jamna Patel.","Former Union minister A K Patel was one of the two first BJP Lok Sabha members.

NEW DELHI: In a show of solidarity, Congress and TMC leaders accompanied the opposition’s Vice Presidential candidate former Supreme Court judge B Sudarshan Reddy to the residence of AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal who assured his party’s full support.Though AAP has disengaged from the bloc it joins hands with INDIA bloc members on issues where it deems fit and Sanjay Singh from the party was present when Reddy filed his nomination in the presence of top opposition leaders earlier in the day.AAP has three MPs in Lok Sabha and out of its 10 MP posts in Rajya Sabha currently it has nine MPs including the estranged Swati Maliwal. One seat fell vacant after MP Sanjeev Arora won the Ludhiana West assembly bypoll in June.Congress’s Pramod Tiwari and Syed Naseer Hussain and TMC’s Kalyan Banerjee were present at the meeting at Kejriwal’s residence. ""Justice Reddy's judicial career is very impressive. He gave many unbiased judgments in favour of the country. I request everyone to vote for him, keeping party affiliations aside,"" Kejriwal said. Noting that Justice Reddy is from Andhra Pradesh where NDA ally TDP is in power, Kejriwal said “we expect parties from AP and Telangana to rise above partisan politics and vote for Telugu pride and national interest. ”With 781 members in the electoral college and 391 required for a majority, the ruling alliance has a clear numerical advantage.",Opposition's vice-presidential candidate B Sudarshan Reddy meets Arvind Kejriwal.

"Lawyer, 27, faked disappearance to escape marriage, traced to Nepal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lawyer-27-faked-disappearance-to-escape-marriage-traced-to-nepal/articleshow/123421063.cms,"Photo/IANS

BHOPAL: A 27-year-old MP lawyer and civil judge aspirant's desperation to escape family pressure to get married led her to meticulously plan a cross-border escape from Itarsi to Nepal's Kathmandu, dodging CCTVs, toll booths and police checkpoints to ensure she didn't leave any trail leading to the life of obscurity she desired.The 13-day search for Archana Tiwari - involving multiple teams from police, GRP and NDRF - culminated Wednesday in Nepal authorities confirming that an Indian woman found living incognito in Kathmandu matched the profile of the young lawyer reported missing by her family after boarding the Indore-Katni Narmada Express on Aug 7.Investigators said her circuitous escape route took her from Itarsi, where she got off the train with an acquaintance, to Kathmandu via Shujalpur, Indore, Hyderabad, Jodhpur, Delhi and then the UP-Nepal border.Her discarded bag had been found in the B3 coach of the train, leading her brother to file a complaint with GRP Katni on Aug 8, the day after Rakshabandhan.Police said they scanned footage from over 500 CCTV cameras, deployed NDRF personnel to scour a forested patch from Barkheda to Budni, and sent divers to search a 32-km stretch of the Narmada. The breakthrough came when investigators pored through her call records.""The name Saransh Jokchand popped up during the scan. Then one thing led to another,"" an officer said. Investigators found out that Saransh travelled with Archana by the Narmada Express and carried clothes for her to change into before getting into a pre-arranged taxi.Tejinder Singh helped the lawyer avoid being captured on surveillance cameras as he was familiar with areas of the railway station outside CCTV coverage. Archana had stopped using her mobile phones before her disappearing act, police said. She handed one of her phones to Tejinder, instructing him to activate it near Midghat and then discard it.Saransh's interrogation gave police enough clues to reconstruct her escape route. ""Being a lawyer, she knew that a missing person case lodged with GRP usually doesn't get pursued aggressively. She was probably convinced the trail would go cold, little knowing that the case would get the media attention it did,"" SP (railways) Rahul Lodha said.Police found out Archana had turned down at least five marriage proposals in recent months. Her family's decision to get her married to a revenue official was purportedly the last straw.","Archana Tiwari, 27, was reported missing by her family after boarding the Indore-Katni Narmada Express on Aug 7.

With them skipping the meeting, one of the participants in the get together is learnt to have remarked that it has become increasingly difficult to bring Congress on board as few of its members, who govt interacts with regularly, can influence the party's decision.Modi said monsoon session covered several important bills and regretted that they could not be discussed in Parliament.On opposition parties keeping away from the meeting, parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju took a swipe at them saying they might have been too ""embarrassed"" with their conduct.","PM Narendra Modi blamed disruptions in Parliament on ""insecurities"" of a few politicians.

The state had asked the EC to rethink its ""disproportionately harsh"" recommendation but the poll panel had insisted that its orders be complied with.Two of the four officers indicted by the EC belong to the West Bengal Civil Service executive cadre. State chief secretary Manoj Pant informed the EC on Thursday of the steps taken by Bengal's govt.The stand-off between the poll panel and Bengal's govt started 16 days ago with EC on Aug 5 seeking action against two EROs (election returning officers) and AEROs (assistant EROs) of Moyna in East Midnapore and Baruipur East in South 24 Parganas ""for failure in supervising election-related work"".Bengal govt reacted by removing an AERO and the data-entry operator from poll duty and starting a probe against all the officers.Unsatisfied, EC seniors asked Pant to meet them in person.Pant appeared before the EC officials on Aug 13 to clarify the Bengal govt's stance. He informed the officials that the state had ordered a fresh probe because it felt the EC's directives were harsh.He was told that the state could probe the matter but he needed to comply with the order by Aug 21 and send a compliance report, and that any further delay would be considered insubordination.A section of lawyers argued that EC has powers both under the Representation of the People Act, 1950 and 1951, and under penal laws to act against officers for omissions in their official duty and to lodge FIRs on its own.
