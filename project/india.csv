NEW DELHI: What started as a row over Union home minister Amit Shah's remark on Dr. BR Ambedkar, took an ugly turn on Thursday with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress embroiled into protest vs counterprotest, scuffle and FIR vs FIR by the two parties.Parliament premises witnessed chaos as the BJP-led NDA and the Congress-led INDIA bloc staged simultaneous protests, accusing each other of disrespecting BR. Ambedkar. The controversy began after the Congress alleged that Union home minister Amit Shah had insulted Ambedkar during his speech in the Rajya Sabha.Congress was leading the attack with a clip from Amit Shah's Rajya Sabha speech, in which on Tuesday he had said, ""Abhi ek fashion ho gaya hai - Ambedkar, Ambedkar, Ambedkar, Ambedkar, Ambedkar, Ambedkar. Itna naam agar bhagwan ka lete to saat janmon tak swarg mil jata (It has become a fashion to say Ambedkar, Ambedkar, Ambedkar, Ambedkar, Ambedkar, Ambedkar'. If they had taken God's name so many times, they would have got a place in heaven).""As the two political fronts held simultaneous protests, a scuffle broke out outside the Parliament complex. The BJP cornered the Congress after its two MPs Pratap Sarangi and Mukesh Rajput were injured and admitted to Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital for head injuries.Pratap Sarangi (69) from Odisha and Mukesh Rajput from Uttar Pradesh were brought to the hospital from Parliament with head injuries, the hospital's Medical Superintendent Dr Ajay Shukla said.""Sarangi was bleeding profusely.

This inflicted injuries on my knees which have already undergone surgery,"" Kharge said.Kharge asked the speaker to order an inquiry into the BJP MPs ""pushing"" him, and said it was an assault not just on him but on the Rajya Sabha LoP and the Congress president.In their letter to Birla, some senior Congress MPs said they were writing to express their ""deep anguish"" over the incident that happened when members of the INDIA bloc were peacefully protesting and marching from the Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar statue to Makar Dwar.Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also dismissed the allegations against bother Rahul by terming it a conspiracy by BJP to protect Amit Shah.""Rahul (Gandhi) was peacefully going inside the Parliament while holding BR Ambedkar's photograph and chanting the 'Jai Bhim' slogan. Who stopped him from going to the Parliament? We have been protesting for so many days and there is always space left for those who are going inside and outside,"" the Wayanad MP said.""Today, they protested for the first time and stopped everyone while resorting to pushing, shoving and hooliganism. This is a conspiracy hatched to save Amit Shah's skin. They pushed Kharge as he fell on the floor before my eyes. After that, a CPI (M) MP was also pushed around and he fell on Kharge. We could see that he has been injured,"" Vadra said.Meanwhile, a BJP MP from Nagaland, Phangnon Konyak, filed a complaint with Rajya Sabha Chairman against Rahul Gandhi, accusing him of misbehaving with her by standing too close and causing discomfort.""I was standing just below the staircase of Makar Dwaar with a placard in my hand. The Security Personnel had cordoned and created a passage to the entrance right for the moment of Hon'ble MP's of other parties. Suddenly, the Leader of the Opposition, Shri Rahul Gandhi Ji along-with other party members came in front of me despite there being a passage created for them,"" her letter stated.""He misbehaved with me in a loud voice and his physical proximity to me was so close that I, being a lady member, felt extremely uncomfortable,"" the MP said.As the row over the scuffle intensified, Congress and BJP delegations reached police station to file FIR and counter FIR.A delegation of Congress MPs including women MPs reached the Parliament Street Police station to complain against the BJP.On the other side, three NDA MPs, including Anurag Thakur and Bansuri Swaraj, reached the same police station to file a complaint against Rahul Gandhi.""We have filed a complaint with Delhi Police against Rahul Gandhi for assault and incitement. We have mentioned in detail the incident that happened today outside Makar Dwar, where NDA MPs were protesting peacefully... We have given a complaint under Sections 109, 115, 117, 125, 131 and 351. Section 109 is attempt to murder, Section 117 is voluntary causing grievous hurt,"" BJP MP Anurag Thakur said after meeting police officials.Delhi Police later registered an FIR against Rahul Gandhi.Later in the day the two parties also held press conferences in which the Congress accused the BJP of orchestrating the scuffle to divert from Adani row and Amit Shah's anti-Ambedkar remark.""A few days before the Parliament session, the Adani case came up in America and the BJP tried to stop the discussion on it. The basic strategy of the BJP was that there should be no discussion on the Adani case, it should be suppressed...

They accused BJP of shielding Union home minister Amit Shah after his ""reprehensible statement"" about BR Ambedkar and demanded his resignation.Condemning Shah's remark (that he gave during his Rajya Sabha address on December 17), Kharge and Gandhi said that they would continue their nation-wide protest.""The BJP wants to divert attention from Shah's remarks on Ambedkar and that is why they are raising other issues,"" Kharge told reporters.Rahul Gandhi in his press conference said, ""A few days before the Parliament session, the Adani case came up in America and the BJP tried to stop the discussion on it.

Karnataka cops rely on DNA test to settle fight over ‘holy’ buffalo,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/karnataka-cops-rely-on-dna-test-to-settle-fight-over-holy-buffalo/articleshow/116481609.cms,"DAVANAGERE: A buffalo dedicated to a temple and worshipped by hundreds of devotees is at the centre of a dispute between two villages in Karnataka's Davanagere district. In an unusual step, police are conducting a DNA test to confirm ownership of the buffalo.The fight is between Kunibelakere and Kulagatte villages, which are 40km apart. With the jury still out, the buffalo is currently under police custody at a Shivamogga goshala.This is a re-run of a similar incident in the district in 2021, when a buffalo's ownership was established through DNA test.Eight years ago, a buffalo was dedicated to Kunibelakere's village deity, Kariyamma Devi. In neighbouring Belakere village, a buffalo was recently found, coinciding with reports of a bovine missing from Kulagatte village of Honnali taluk. Kulagatte residents transported the buffalo to their village, claiming its ownership. Madappa Rangannavar from the village claimed it had been missing for two months.However, this prompted Kunibelakere villagers to assert their rights over the animal, leading to a confrontation that required police intervention.There was a disagreement over the buffalo's age, too. Kunibelakere claimed the animal was eight years old, while Kulagatte put its age at three. An examination by veterinarians suggested the animal was over six years old, supporting Kunibelakere's claim. However, Kulagatte villagers contested this.Subsequently, Kunibelakere residents filed a theft case against seven persons from Kulagatte and sought a DNA test, citing the presence of the buffalo's offspring in their village as evidence. Dander Tippesh from Kunibelakere said the case has reached the Davanagere SP's office.Additional SP Vijaykumar Santosh confirmed DNA samples had been collected, and the matter would be resolved upon receiving the test results.","The fight is between Kunibelakere and Kulagatte villages, which are 40km apart.

""In Nov, you lost badly in Maharashtra. At least now stop lying. Because your lies will not go unchecked. The truth will always win. Jai Bhim,"" the Union minister said.Shah had accused Congress of distorting his remarks and has received strong support from his party's members, including PM Narendra Modi.""So, I thought of sharing some facts to illustrate the deep Congress hate towards Dr Ambedkar. Pandit Nehru hated Dr Ambedkar. Yes, it was unfiltered hate. That is why Pandit Nehru got Dr Ambedkar defeated twice (in elections),"" Nadda said.""Nehru was proudly writing to people overseas, expressing joy that Ambedkar was no longer in the Cabinet,"" he added.Nadda said the ""self-proclaimed custodians"" of social justice in Congress made empty promises of making a grand memorial at 'Chaitya Bhoomi', where Ambedkar was cremated in Mumbai, but it was the Modi govt which ensured in 2015 that land transfer was done. Modi prayed there twice in recent years, the Union minister added.The BJP president also shared a deleted post of Congress member Sam Pitroda, who had rated Nehru's contribution to the Constitution bigger than Ambedkar.""The most loyal courtier of the dynasty spelt out what Congress really thinks of Dr Ambedkar, that he had no role in the making of our Constitution. Some screenshots indeed speak a thousand words,"" he said.The post can be deleted but their real feelings will never go, Nadda added.","Congress has insulted and ignored Ambedkar as well as his legacy, he alleged.

BJP MLC Ram Shinde’s filing of nomination is being seen as a setback for Shinde-led Sena, which was seeking the legislative council chairperson’s post. (PTI)

NAGPUR: BJP MLC Ram Shinde filed his nomination for the election to the chairperson of the legislative council on Wednesday. While chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and deputy CM Ajit Pawar accompanied Ram Shinde, deputy CM Eknath Shinde didn't join them.Ram's nomination is being seen as a setback for Shiv Sena led by Eknath, which was seeking the council chairperson's post. Sena's Neelam Gorhe, who is currently deputy chairperson, was said to be in the race.Ram said, "" Congress also said that it will not be filing any nominations, so this election will be unopposed. That has sent a good message. I thank CM Fadnavis and the deputy CMs. Some discussion could have happened at the senior level between BJP and Sena.""Elections to the prestigious post were not held as Shiv Sena and NCP were split in 2022 and 2023 respectively. BJP has a majority in the council, but Sena was keen to get the post since BJP has the speaker's post in the legislative assembly. Now BJP will have presiding officers in both Houses of the legislature.Party sources said BJP has picked Ram for the post as he is from the Dhangar community. He was MLA from Karjat-Jamkhed but was defeated by NCP's (SP) Rohit Pawar in 2019 and in 2024.In July, Maha Vikas Aghadi's MLAs and MLCs led by leader of opposition in the legislative council Ambadas Danve had met then governor Ramesh Bais and urged him to direct that the election to the council's chairperson be held during the monsoon session. However, the election was not held then.A BJP functionary said, ""Ram lost the assembly polls in 2019 and was made an MLC, but he also lost the 2024 assembly polls. However, so far neither he nor MLA Gopichand Padalkar, who is also from the Dhangar community, have been made ministers in the new govt. So the party is nominating Ram for the chairperson's post. BJP is the largest party in the council and Ram's election will be easy and most likely unopposed.""","BJP MLC Ram Shinde filed his nomination for the election to the chairperson of the legislative council on Wednesday.

NEW DELHI: The central government will be sending the bills meant for simultaneous elections to the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC), comprising 31 parliamentarians, including Congress leaders Priyanka Gandhi, Manish Tewari, BJP's Anurag Singh Thakur and Anil Baluni.The JPC for the "" One Nation One Election "" bill, officially named the Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-Ninth Amendment) Bill, 2024 and Union Territories Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024, will have 12 MPs from Lok Sabha and 10 from Rajya Sabha.Other members of the JPC include Samajwadi Party's Dharmendra Yadav, TMC's Kalyan Banerjee, NCP-SP's Supriya Sule, Shiv Sena's Shrikant Shinde, BJP's Sambit Patra and Anil Baluni.Union law minister Arjun Meghwal on Tuesday introduced two bills aimed at conducting simultaneous Lok Sabha and Assembly elections, as part of the 'one nation, one election' initiative, which sparked strong opposition protests .The bills, however, failed to secure the required two-thirds majority in the lower house, receiving 269 votes in favour and 198 against. The opposition parties criticised the bills as an attack on federalism, while the government asserted that the bill was in line with the Constitution.""ONOE bills in line with Constitution, do not assault basic structure doctrine. Objections to ONOE bills political in nature,"" stated the law minister.The opposition demanded immediate withdrawal of the bills, labelling them as an assault on the Constitution and an attempt to ""kill democracy and bring authoritarianism and dictatorship"".Earlier, Union home minister Amit Shah revealed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had suggested sending the bill to the JPC for thorough examination.""When the One Nation, One Election Bill was taken up in the cabinet for approval, PM Modi had said that it should be sent to the JPC for detailed discussion.

'Nothing new': Ambedkar's grandson reacts to Amit Shah's remarks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nothing-new-ambedkars-grandson-reacts-to-amit-shahs-remarks/articleshow/116456296.cms,"NEW DELHI: Babasaheb Ambedkar's grandson, Prakash Ambedkar , on Wednesday criticised Union home minister Amit Shah for his remarks on the architect of the Indian Constitution, describing them as reflective of the BJP 's ""same old mentality."" His comments came amidst an ongoing political row, with opposition parties demanding a resignation from Shah, accusing him of insulting BR Ambedkar .Speaking to reporters in Pune, Prakash Ambedkar, who heads the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA), alleged that Shah's remarks reveal the BJP's underlying disdain for Ambedkar’s contributions. ""Before the BJP came into existence, its forerunners Jan Sangh and RSS had opposed Babasaheb while the Constitution was being adopted,"" he said. He added, “There is nothing new in the statement. They are not able to execute their old plans. Not because of Congress, but because of Babasaheb Ambedkar and they will continue to sulk.”He also demanded Rs 1 crore compensation for the family of Somnath Suryawanshi, who died in judicial custody following violence in Parbhani city over the desecration of a Constitution replica.The controversy erupted after Shah, during a Rajya Sabha debate, remarked, ""It has become a fashion to repeatedly invoke Ambedkar’s name. If they had taken God’s name as often, they would have earned a place in heaven.""The comments sparked outrage, with several MPs from the INDIA bloc staging protests in Parliament and the Congress demanding a public apology. Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh shared a video snippet of Shah's remarks, accusing the BJP of belittling Ambedkar’s legacy.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, however, defended Shah, accusing the Congress of distorting his remarks. Modi claimed Shah’s comments exposed the Congress’ “anti-Ambedkar history,” alleging that the party had previously worked to undermine Ambedkar, including denying him the Bharat Ratna and opposing his electoral bids. ""Congress can try as they want, but people know the truth about their legacy,"" Modi stated.Congress leaders, including Rahul Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge, dismissed Modi's defence, accusing the BJP of systematically undermining Ambedkar’s ideology. “They are against the Constitution and Ambedkar’s vision,” Gandhi said, warning that the BJP’s actions are aimed at erasing Ambedkar’s contributions.","Babasaheb Ambedkar's grandson criticises Union home minister Amit Shah for his remarks on the architect of the Indian Constitution.
