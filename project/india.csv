"‘INDIA bloc is an immature dal, will disappear after polls’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-bloc-is-an-immature-dal-will-disappear-after-polls/articleshow/110578343.cms,"If you are re-elected MP what facilities or changes will you bring that couldn’t be achieved in the first term?

Gorakhpur is still struggling with waterlogging, unemployment and traffic jams. What have you done to resolve them as the MP?

Opposition calls you an ‘outsider’ here. What do you have to say about it? Also, it is alleged that since you come from the film industry you give more time to Mumbai than Gorakhpur?

How will BJP fare in Purvanchal this time? In the last polls, BJP failed to make a clean sweep despite ‘Modi wave’ in 2019 and could win 18 of the 27 seats. Will BJP win all 80 seats in UP?

You are among BJP’s star campaigners. Tell us how this election is different for you than 2019

Last time it was SP-BSP alliance and this time it’s INDIA bloc. Will it pose a challenge to you and the party?

What win margin are you aiming for? How many seats will BJP win in UP and the country?

NEW DELHI: Actor-politician and sitting MP Ravi Kishan , who is seeking re-election from Gorakhpur , felt that the dignity of polls has been lowered by the opposition’s personal attack on PM and says that BJP will secure a landslide victory banking on the works done by PM Narendra Modi and CM Yogi Adityanath. He adds that the INDIA bloc is nothing but ‘26 logon ka ek immature dal’ which will disintegrate as soon as the poll results are announced. In a chat with TOI’s Mohita Tewari, he spoke about his poll prospects and priorities. Excerpts:It’s my dream to set up a regional film city in Gorakhpur like the Film and Television Institute of India in Pune. I am a student of cinema and the one who set up a new film (Bhojpuri) industry in Mumbai. I had given employment to around one lakh people in Mumbai. I know how to generate employment with the help of cinema. I want to end the struggle of lakhs of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar children who want to make their career in this field. They will learn the art in their state and won’t have to struggle in Mumbai.We have invested over Rs 1,000 crore to solve the waterlogging issue. We have set up a water regulator in Tarkulani village which sucks up excess water and diverts it towards the river to prevent waterlogging. Now we are constructing Goddhaiya Nala with an investment of Rs 1,100 crore. Around 80% of its work is complete. This way we have resolved the waterlogging issue to a great extent and just a few places are left which will be made free from the problem. On employment front, we have made Gorakhpur Industrial Development Authority where big companies are coming, and students will get a lot of job opportunities. Also, I have raised the issue in Parliament demaning opening of IIT and IIM in Gorakhpur. This would help students get quality education and technical skills too. For resolving traffic woes, we have got Rs 2,650 crore sanctioned from govt for the construction of the ring road. Its work is in progress.You are sitting in my house. I have shifted here with my wife and my children. If you just scroll down my social media wall of the last five years you will find my presence here, be it during the construction of the underpass, railway track or flyover, or inauguration of new facilities, you will find me wearing a mask and carrying a ration on a boat to help people during the pandemic. I am the only one who has raised 500 questions in Parliament in the interest of public and have become the No. 1 parliamentarian in Uttar Pradesh.Seats are won with ‘work’ and fulfilling ‘commitment’. My Prime Minister Modiji is a man of his words. ‘Unki kathani aur karni mai antar nahi hai’ the same is true with ‘Maharaj ji (CM Yogi). Be it Ram Mandir or Ayushman Yojana, all work committed by the party have been done. I am sure of a very big success in this region. We are winning maximum seats in UP including all in Purvanchal.“Maine itni ghatiya rajneeti ka starr nahi dekha, maine bahut saare election dekhey hain bachpan se par vipaksh ka starr bahut gir gaya hai iss election me. They don’t have facts or figures to counter PM Modi and hence are personally attacking PM and also Yogiji. ‘Rahul Gandhiji ki bhasha, Akhilesh Yadavji ki bhasha, inke pass jhoothe aropon ke alawa kuch nahi hai. The opposition doesn’t have anything to oppose, all they have is ‘26 logon ka immature dal’.These people are here just for elections. After elections you will see them flying off to foreign shores. Their flights are already booked for Italy and Australia. They don’t know India. It is a land of villages and they will get lost here if left alone. Modi govt has worked for all sections of society. Hence people from all communities, religions and castes have aligned to vote for him be it backward class, SC or Muslim women. Govt schemes like distribution of free ration, giving houses to poor and others have benefitted all. It was PM Modi who asked me to make a movie on organic farming and real India, hence my recently released film Lapata Ladies is getting so much love from people.Last time it was ‘Damru’ of our success and I am confident that this time it will be a deafening ‘Nagada’ of success.

"In Premchand’s birthplace Lamhi, change is on view, and in the air",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-premchands-birthplace-lamhi-change-is-on-view-and-in-the-air/articleshow/110578059.cms,"LAMHI: Poised roughly 10km from Varanasi, Lamhi could have been another faceless village of east Uttar Pradesh . But as the birthplace of Hindi-Urdu litterateur Munshi Premchand , it is both celebrated and privileged. Only, it is no longer a village, either by looks or designation.Over the years, especially in the last decade, north India’s premier temple town has swelled and swallowed nearby areas. Lamhi is now part of Varanasi’s Nagar Nigam (municipal corporation). “We wanted the ward to be named after Premchand. But it didn’t happen,” says former pradhan Santosh Singh.Little surprise, real estate prices have soared. “From roughly Rs 10-12 lakh about a decade ago, a biswa (1,360 sq ft) costs anywhere between Rs 40 lakh and Rs 80 lakh now, depending on the locality. You could rent a single room for as little as Rs 300 per month. Now it is Rs 2,500,” he says.Lamhi has a panchayat bhavan, a post office, a primary school and a primary health centre. Small entrepreneurs are active. Beauty parlours, dry-cleaners, hardware stores, cosmetics and jewellery shops have also sprung up. Fresh advertisements of cement, private hospitals and coaching classes garnish the village walls. Premchand’s realistic novels and stories captured the song and suffering of rural India like few before or after. One wonders how the writer would have reacted to the change.Nearly 90 years after his death, Premchand too is all over Lamhi. The gateway to the village bears his memory. A memorial with a marble bust, a dormant research and study centre affiliated to Banaras Hindu University (BHU) and a pond are named after the ex-village’s illustrious son.Lamhi is part of Chandauli Lok Sabha constituency. Patels (OBCs by caste) form roughly half the village’s population. The Patel percentage was higher but with other castes such as Brahmins building homes here in recent years, the larger caste demographic has altered. Kayasthas roughly form 10%. Premchand was a Kayastha; his real name being Dhanpat Rai Srivastav. Muslims, Dalits, Kumhars, Rajbhars and Thakurs make up the rest. The village has about 2,600 votes.Chandauli has been fickle in choosing political sides: Samajwadi Party (1999), Bahujan Samaj Party (2004), and SP again in (2009). But the last two terms (2014 and 2019) were claimed by BJP’s Mahendra Nath Pandey, the 62-year-old former Union minister who holds a doctorate in Hindi from BHU.By all accounts, Pandey was on an unsure wicket in the previous elections, till Pulwama happened. The Feb 2019 terror strike left 40 CRPF soldiers dead. One of them, Awadesh Kumar Yadav, was from Chandauli district. Some others were born in nearby east Uttar Pradesh areas of Deoria and Maharajganj. The dastardly attack changed the public mood. Several demonstrations were staged. Pandey prevailed by 14,000 votes; in 2014, he had romped home by 1.6 lakh votes.In the recent past, most Patels have preferred BJP, which is in alliance with Anupriya Patel’s Apna Dal (S). Surendra Patel, who runs a hardware store, says a majority of Patels are still with BJP but, this time, quite a few will vote for others. “Not many like the BJP candidate. SP’s Birender Singh is more accessible and people-oriented,” he says. Birendra, a 65-year-old science graduate, is a former MLA.Ajay Gupta, who runs a small grocery store, says his family will vote for Modi. “Mehngai hai par vikas bhi hai (There’s price rise, but development too),” he reasons. Mohd Sabir, whose family has received free grains and benefited from a subsidy for toilet construction some time back, differs. The 23-year-old driver talks about mehngai (price rise) and how examination paper leaks are a major issue for students. “There are about 250 Muslim votes in the village. Most will vote for SP,” he says.Aiedhe village is contiguous to Lamhi. A group of Dalits sitting near Sant Shiromani Guru Ravidas Mandir are playing cards on a charpoy. They are annoyed with the Union govt. “Govt schools are no good and private ones are too expensive. How do we compete in this unequal world?” asks Rajesh Kumar. The Dalits are not happy with Mayawati either, especially the way she has handled the ‘political successor’ issue. “She should have discussed the subject with more seniors,” says Manish Kumar, an ITI student. The disappointments aside, most Dalits will vote for the 50-yearold BSP candidate Satendra Kumar Maurya. Like Akansha, a girl filling water from a hand pump.Suresh Chandra Dube, who looks after the Premchand memorial, says people want Modi to stay. “But unemployment and price rise worry them. Log mayoos hain (people are despondent),” he says.In a small room in the memorial, the writer’s books, photos and memorabilia are on display. The items include his personal hookah (smoking pipe). One black and white photo shows him with fellow Hindi litterateur Jaishankar Prasad; in another he is sitting in a chair with his wife. Premchand, who spent his last years in deprivation, is seen wearing torn shoes which later prompted a much-discussed essay by noted writer Harishankar Parsai.Godan and Nirmala are among Premchand’s finest novels. Shatranj Ke Khiladi, the subject of a 1978 Satyajit Ray film, Kafan and Idgah are among his greatest stories. “All copies of his book, Soz-e-Watan, were burnt by the British. Premchand was a patriot and a reformer,” says Dube. What saddens him is that the research institute is now defunct. “There are no books, teachers, research scholars or sanitation workers. Only the security guards come and go,” he says.","Lamhi is the birthplace of Hindi-Urdu litterateur Munshi Premchand.

"In Diamond Harbour, Trinamool expects its ‘ratna’ to shine again",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-diamond-harbour-trinamool-expects-its-ratna-to-shine-again/articleshow/110577859.cms,"The rise of Diamond Harbour in West Bengal ’s political map in the last decade has been intertwined with the phenomenal growth of its MP Abhishek Banerjee in Bengal politics.From a novice in 2014 to Trinamool Congress ’s general secretary and No.2 in 2024, the political strides of Banerjee have also seen Diamond Harbour, a former Left bastion, elect him with a 3.2 lakh margin in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. The 2021 assembly polls gave Banerjee further cushion, with Trinamool winning all seven segments in the Lok Sabha constituency.“I’m contesting an election. I’m not an astrologer. I can’t predict the future, but I have left no stone unturned in serving people.... I’m hopeful and optimistic that the margin that Diamond Harbour gave me last time will increase further and people will continue to shower their love and blessings on us as we have worked hard in the last 10 years,” Banerjee said.Courtesy Banerjee, there is the ‘Diamond Harbour model’ — a mix of welfare schemes for the elderly and others, health facilities and educational initiatives. It had become the talking point in the state during Covid. In the last 10 years, projects worth Rs 5,580 crore were implemented in Diamond Harbour constituency, Banerjee claimed, saying it would be replicated statewide.Since his 2019 Lok Sabha poll win, Banerjee has emerged as the ‘general’ in Trinamool ranks. During the highly successful 2021 assembly poll campaign, he devised the party strategy and anchored the campaign with his aunt and Bengal CMMamata Banerjee . He also played a key role in the party’s success in the municipal and panchayat polls, in 2022 and 2023, respectively.While campaigning for Banerjee in Metiabruz on Wednesday, Mamata recollected: “I had promised Abhishek that I would visit his constituency once. Abhishek has been in politics since he was two years old when CPM attacked me. He saw me and would chant slogans seeking answers from CPM for attacking me. These CPM goons have become the leaders of the BJP.”A day before, women and men had gathered on both sides of Sarisha Cross- ing braving the scorching sun to get a glimpse of Banerjee during a roadshow. Nearly one-and-a-half hours later, he arrived sitting atop his MUV and was greeted with ululation and the blowing of conch shells. Banerjee, the politician, is also a youth icon here. “The younger ones have his hairstyle and wear white kurtapyjamas and spectacles like him,” said Ratanpur farmer Rehan Ali, who travelled 5km to watch Banerjee.On the other hand, the opposition campaign, beset with rumblings, has been a late starter in Diamond Harbour. Despite multiple claims by key partner Indian Secular Front’s Nawsad Siddiqui, the only MLA of the Left-Congress alliance in the 2021 assembly elections, that he would contest against Banerjee, the party finally nominated Majnu Laskar as its candidate. CPM had already nominated Pratikur Rahaman as its candidate. BJP took more than a month to name Abhijit Das.Diamond Harbour has around 55% Hindus and 35% Muslims voters. SCs comprise 20.6%, and STs 0.1% of the electorate. As much as 51% of its voters are staying in urban zones.Like any other Lok Sabha seat, Diamond Harbour too has issues plaguing it. Opposition alleges “a climate of threat and intimidation”.Residents complain of water scarcity issues, waterlogging and most importantly, of shut industries on the urban stretches at Satgachia, Maheshtala or Budge Budge.Perhaps it is nowhere more evident than at Budge Budge, an old settlement dotted with jute mills, oil companies, and small industrial units. A lot of high-rises have come up on old industrial premises on the Budge Budge Road from Dakghar to Budge Budge via Maheshtala.“TMC is propagating a model of coercion and undemocratic practices. The way voters are being intimidated is unacceptable in a democracy. It is not a model for development, but a laboratory of violence,” said BJP’s Das. The party had a sizable 34% vote share in the last elections.CPM state committee member Pratikur, 33, dismisses claims of being intimidated by Banerjee’s stature.“I am not fighting against any individual. My fight is against the policies of TMC and BJP,” he claimed. “They are trying to polarise elections on religious grounds. Our fight is not for caste or religion but for class. They cannot stop me with violence. I will fight back hard,” Rahaman said.","Diamond Harbour MP Abhishek Banerjee has been in politics since he was two years old.

NEW DELHI: Following the conclusion of election campaign for Lok Sabha Elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi reached the Vivekananda Rock Memorial and began his 2-day meditation till June 1. PM Modi is meditating at the Dhyan Mandapam, the same spot where Swami Vivekananda once meditated.The Prime Minister arrived at the Bhagavathi Amman temple from nearby Thiruvananthapuram by helicopter. He worshipped at the temple and then made his way to the rock memorial via a ferry service.Dressed in a dhoti and a white shawl, Modi offered prayers at the temple and walked all the way round the 'garbhagriha'. The priests performed a special 'arthi' and presented him with temple 'prasad', which included a shawl and a framed photograph of the temple's presiding deity.After the 'arthi' PM Modi reached the rock memorial using a ferry service provided by the state government-run shipping corporation. He commenced his meditation at the 'dhyan mandapam.' Prior to beginning his meditation, the prime minister briefly stood on the stairs leading to the mandapam, taking in the stunning views of the surrounding sea.Modi paid his respects to Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, mother Sri Sarada Devi, and Swami Vivekananda by showering flowers on their portraits. A life-size statue of Swami Vivekananda on a high pedestal adorns the mandapam. Following this, Modi began his sadhana (spiritual practice) within the mandapam.At the end of the 2014 and 2019, PM Modi had made similar trips - first to Pratapgarh, the stronghold of Shivaji, and later to a cave in the vicinity of the Kedarnath temple.This visit will mark the Prime Minister's ninth trip to Tamil Nadu since January.Kanniyakumari holds a special place in the life of Swami Vivekananda, as it was here that he had a profound vision of Bharat Mata after wandering across the country. The rock upon which he meditated for three days is believed to have had a significant impact on his life, similar to how Sarnath is important in the life of Gautam Buddha.The location also has religious significance, as it is believed that Goddess Parvati meditated on one foot at the same spot while waiting for Lord Shiva.Kanniyakumari is not only the meeting point of India's eastern and western coastlines but also the confluence of the Indian Ocean, Bay of Bengal, and Arabian Sea.It is well-known that PM Modi undertakes spiritual journeys at the end of election campaigns, having previously visited Kedarnath in 2019 and Shivaji's Pratapgarh in 2014.Swami Vivekananda took India’s spiritual fame to the world at the Parliament of World’s Religions held in Chicago in 1893. It was in honour of the great monk that the memorial was erected in 1970. The rock on which the memorial is built is said to be where Vivekananda attained enlightenment. Legends also say that it was on this rock that goddess Kanniyakumari prayed to lord Shiva, thus attaining an important place in India’s religious premises. There is a specially preserved portion in the rock which is believed to be the imprint of the goddess’s feet. The memorial showcases an elegant blend of different architectural genres. The Sripada Mandapam and Vivekananda Mandapam are two structures to be explored in the memorial. There is also a life-sized bronze statue of Swami Vivekananda in the premises.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived at the Bhagavathi Amman temple from nearby Thiruvananthapuram by helicopter.

He has pervasive control over the chief minister and Nabin Niwas,"" Sarma added.Sarma also commented on Patnaik's response regarding his continuation as chief minister for the next five years if BJD wins the upcoming election. He suggested that either Pandian has already selected a ""successor"" or that Patnaik knows the BJP is likely to win the election.Earlier in the day, Patnaik dismissed the allegations made by BJP leaders that VK Pandian is ""controlling the state"", calling them ridiculous and insignificant. In an interview with ANI, when asked if his close associate VK Pandian acts as a gatekeeper and takes all decisions on his behalf, Patnaik responded, ""That is ridiculous and I have said it often before. This is an old allegation and it holds no weight"".Patnaik suggested that the BJP's accusations against his close confidant are a result of their growing desperation due to their declining popularity both in Odisha and across the country. He stated, ""I see it that they are getting more and more desperate, particularly as their popularity is waning in the country"".When questioned about the future leadership of his party, the Odisha CM assured that the BJD remains dedicated to serving the people of Odisha.

In fact, both BJP chief JP Nadda and Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge were warned and told by the poll body to rein in their star campaigners which included PM Modi and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi among others.The EC had then said in a statement: ""The Commission expects top leaders of political parties, especially of the major national parties, most of whom are star campaigners, to set good examples of campaign discourse expected of them in the current elections.""""It is primarily the leaders' responsibility to correct the course of their statements ""to avoid any permanent dent on the delicately balanced social fabric of the country,"" the poll body had told the party chiefs of BJP and Congress.As the campaign ended for the final phase of polls which is to be held on June 1, Kharge attacked Prime Minister Modi and claimed that he spoke about 'mandir-masjid' and divisive issues 421 times during poll campaigning despite the Election Commission's direction of no appeal for votes on caste and religion.Kharge also claimed that PM Modi in his speeches of the last 15 days took the Congress's name 232 times, his own name 758 times, but didn't talk about unemployment even once.PM Modi's predecessor Manmohan Singh on Thursday accused him of lowering the dignity of public discourse and the gravity of the office of the prime minister by giving ""hateful speeches"" during the poll campaign.However, undeterred by these attacks, the Prime Minister in his last rally for these elections asked the opposition to make no mistake in understanding him as he can disclose ""sins of their seven generations.""""I want to tell INDI Alliance leaders. I am silent but you should not make a mistake in understanding Modi... 'Modi jis din muh kholega to tumhari saat pidhi ke paap nikaal ke rakh dunga' (The day Modi opens his mouth, he will bring out the sins of your seven generations),"" he said.Prime Minister election speeches saw fierce attacks on the opposition, especially the Congress. From accusing the grand old party of planning to steal the Mangalsutras of women to charging the opposition of doing Mujra, one of the key themes of PM's attack was the policy of alleged appeasement by opposition parties.In his speeches, PM Modi also raised pitch against opposition's alleged plans to end reservations for OBCs and give those benefits to minorities (read Muslims).PM Modi started his Lok Sabha campaign with a strong pitch of Abki Baar 400 paar asserting that the NDA would win 400 seats and the BJP will cross the 370 mark. However, as the campaign progressed the discourse and narrative changed.Prime Minister Modi's 2024 election campaign of over 200 rallies and roadshows surpassed his nearly-145 public engagements during the 2019 polls during which the campaign period was 68 days. When the Election Commission announced the polls on March 16, PM Modi was already on a political tour of southern India - covering all five states in the three days between March 15 and March 17. We will have to wait till June 4, when the poll results will be out, to know how effective was PM Modi's high-pitched record campaign.(With inputs from agencies)",Prime Minister Narendra Modi's whirlwind Lok Sabha election campaign ended on Thursday.

""MEA has initiated action under provisions in the Passport Act 1967 for revocation of the diplomatic passport of Prajwal Revanna.

A day ago, Prajwal Revanna filed an anticipatory bail application in the sexual assault case at the Bengaluru sessions court.

Congress leader and Karnataka Minister Priyank Kharge slammed the suspended JD-S leader Prajwal Revanna and said, ""I'm quite surprised that he remained silent when videos went viral, when a complaint was filed by the victims, and when the pen drives were being distributed. Suddenly, his consciousness wakes up and he says I was depressed and isolated. If you see the video closely, it doesn't look like a person in depression is speaking. He did not say a word about the victims. He could have said the same thing on Days 1, and 2. Why did it take him 30 days? If you look from a bird's eye view, you'll know that the BJP is directing everything.""

A damdar govt is one that decimates the enemy. A damdar govt is one that goes right into the enemy’s home to strike. A damdar govt is one that makes Bharat atmanirbhar (self-dependent) in every way possible,” Modi said.The PM said BJP had drawn up a roadmap for the first 125 days of its prospective third term, reserving 25 of those for the welfare of the country’s youth.Accusing AAP of “destroying both agriculture and industry” in Punjab and Congress of fathering corruption in the country, Modi said he could take all the insults hurled at him by them, but not anyone making a mockery of the country and its people.He said there could be “no greater sin” than constituents of the INDIA bloc using the armed forces as a political weapon, alluding to Congress and its allies repeatedly talking about scrapping the Agnipath recruitment scheme if the alliance came to office.“You abuse Modi as much you want, but Modi will not tolerate this insult to my country’s armed forces. I am silent but you should not make any mistake in understanding Modi...Modi jis din muh kholega, tumhari saat pidhi ke paap nikaal ke rakh dega (The day Modi opens his mouth, he will bring out the sins of your seven generations),” the PM said.On AAP, which came to office in Punjab by ousting ally Congress, Modi said, “It took Congress 60 years to do a PhD in corruption but they (AAP) are born corrupt.” He added, “In Punjab, they are doing a drama of contesting separately, but in Delhi, they are together.”The PM, who campaigned for BJP candidates Anita Som Parkash and Subhash Sharma, said the drug mafia was operating with impunity in Punjab and gang wars were escalating alongside atrocities on women.“AAP is watching all this happen. Their chief (Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal ) makes fake slogans and fake policies, and has malicious intent,” he said.On Congress alleging that BJP would “change the Constitution” if it got a third term, Modi said the irony was that “these are the same people who strangulated the Constitution during Emergency”.“Where was the Constitution when burning tyres were put around Sikhs during the 1984 riots?” Modi said Kartarpur Sahib “would have been in India had Congress not left it to Pakistan”.He said the next BJP govt would name Adampur airport after Guru Ravidas . “When you come to see Guru Ravidas’s place (in Varanasi), you are my guest as I am the MP of that constituency.”","PM Modi wrapped up his marathon campaign in Punjab ’s Hoshiarpur Thursday.

"Rishi Sunak sees 78 Tory MPs exit ahead of July poll, surpassing 1997 exodus before Tony Blair's win",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/rishi-sunak-sees-78-tory-mps-exit-ahead-of-july-poll-surpassing-1997-exodus-before-tony-blairs-win/articleshow/110445174.cms,"Britain's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak (AFP photo)

There were tears, anger and frustration as many Conservative lawmakers digested their PM Rishi Sunak 's decision to call the UK elections on July 4, much earlier than they had ever expected.

Some of those fighting to retain their seats feared the six weeks left to convince skeptical voters to back them would not be enough. For others planning to stand down, it meant an abrupt end to their political careers , forced to clear out their offices months earlier than planned.Trailing Labour by over 20 percentage points in polls, Sunak, analysts said, is betting that the Tories can cut their losses by facing the voters.

But a grassroots Conservative campaign coordinator said that the morale was the lowest he had known in five decades. Tory members of parliament seem to share this sense of futility: 78 of them have opted not to contest their seats, an exodus that includes Michael Gove, who once vied for party's top post and has been at the heart of nearly every Conservative-led govt since David Cameron's in 2010. Other high profile figures who have announced they will not seek re-election include former PM Theresa May, Northern Ireland minister Chris Heaton- Harris, ex-armed forces minister James Heappey and ex-defence minister Ben Wallace.

The number of Tories exiting is more than the previous post-1945 high of 72 who quit prior to Tony Blair's 1997 landslide win for Labour, which is expected to triumph again. The departures add to a feeling that the Conservatives are on track to be kicked out of power after 14 years, although Labour require a big swing to secure a majority. Sunak's decision to go to the polls early has triggered fears that he's leading the party to one or more ""Portillo"" moments - when a Tory big beast loses a safe seat in an election whitewash - named for the time cabinet minister Michael Portillo lost in Enfield Southgate in 1997.
