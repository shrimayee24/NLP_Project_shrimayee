NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday modified an order by Bombay high court to constitute a special investigation team (SIT) under Lakhmi Gautam, the joint commissioner of police, Mumbai, to probe allegations against policemen in the Badlapur 'fake' encounter case and directed Maharashtra's director general of police (DGP) to supervise the probe.Seeking modification of HC order, solicitor general Tushar Mehta , appearing for the state, told a bench of Justices Bela M Trivedi and P B Varale that the govt has no issue with the constitution of the SIT but submitted that it should be under the supervision of the DGP. Allowing the plea, the bench modified the high court's direction and said Maharashtra's DGP will constitute an SIT to probe allegations against five policemen for the custodial death of Badlapur sexual assault case accused Akshay Shinde.Shinde, accused of sexually assaulting two minor girls at a school in Badlapur in Thane district, was allegedly shot in a police van on September 23, 2024, when he was being taken to Kalyan from the Taloja prison for questioning in another case.Supreme Court said, ""...it is directed that the SIT shall be constituted by the DGP consisting of officers as he may deem appropriate."" It aso directed the state CID to hand over papers to the DGP in two days.Bombay HC had ordered an FIR against five policemen and the setting up of an SIT under the supervision of JCP Lakhmi Gautam . Modifying the high court's direction, the apex court said the Maharashtra DGP would constitute the SIT which would continue the probe.Since Shinde's father, who had moved the HC for an SIT or CBI probe into the death, had withdrawn himself from the proceeding before the HC, the SC bench decided not to issue a notice to him. ""We may clarify that the complainant, if he has any grievance, may approach the competent court i.e the magistrate concerned or sessions court as the case may be for appropriate relief,"" the judges said.","Bombay HC had ordered an FIR against five policemen and the setting up of an SIT under the supervision of JCP Lakhmi Gautam.

Cop becomes 1st ‘candidate’ acquitted in Vyapam case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cop-becomes-1st-candidate-acquitted-in-vyapam-case/articleshow/120910851.cms,"BHOPAL: In a blow to Madhya Pradesh's Special Task Force (STF), a CBI special court in Bhopal has delivered the first-ever acquittal of a 'candidate' named in the infamous Vyapam scam - India's largest recruitment and exam scandal that has engulfed over 3,000 accused, including students, officials, and middlemen.The lone acquitted candidate, 32-year-old Sajan Singh Thakur , is a police constable posted at Kotwali police station in Harda. A native of Damaria village in Seoni Malwa tehsil of Narmadapuram district, he was accused of fraudulently securing his post by using a proxy to appear in the 2013 Professional Examination Board (PEB) recruitment test.The case against him was initiated in Oct 2021, when a confidential complaint reached the additional director general of police, STF Bhopal, alleging that Thakur paid Rs 5 lakh to a proxy exam-taker - referred to as a 'Munna Bhai' - with financial help from his brother, Pappu Thakur.STF investigators collected Thakur's handwriting and fingerprints, retrieved original recruitment documents, and sent them for forensic analysis. The prosecution claimed there were discrepancies, indicative of impersonation.An FIR was registered in Dec 2022, and Thakur was arrested in March 2023. He was granted bail while the trial progressed. A chargesheet was submitted before the special court in Aug 2024, and he was subsequently suspended.On May 2, 2025, the CBI special court dealing with Vyapam cases ruled that the prosecution had failed to prove charges beyond reasonable doubt. Citing inconclusive forensic results, lack of eyewitness testimony, and unproven elements of conspiracy and intent, the court acquitted Thakur.Speaking to TOI after the judgment, advocate Gopesh Sikkewal, counsel for Thakur, said, ""The prosecution was unable to provide substantial explanations on several technical issues during cross-examination. Since he has been acquitted of the charges, we will be filing a petition to get him reinstated in the police force, along with all financial benefits that he deserves till date.""The court ordered Thakur's acquittal under IPC sections 419, 420, 467, 468, 471, 120B, and provisions of the MP Recognised Examinations Act, 1937. His bail bond was cancelled, and a copy of the judgment was sent to the Bhopal district magistrate. The prosecution is likely to file an appeal in the case.This case is among hundreds tied to the Vyapam scam, a massive network of exam fraud that rocked Madhya Pradesh, involving the rigging of entrance exams for medical colleges, govt jobs, and professional courses. Over the past decade, the scam has exposed a nexus of candidates, impersonators, officials, and politicians - undermining public trust in the recruitment process and triggering national outrage.","Sajan Singh Thakur, 32, is a police constable posted at Kotwali police station in Harda.

The report details the sequence of events after the fire incident and the mysterious disappearance of cash captured in a video shot by first responders.However, there was no information about the nature of the voluminous report or its findings. The report is learned to have annexed statements of over 50 witnesses examined by the panel.The witnesses included the Delhi police commissioner, the Delhi Fire Services chief who had given contradictory statements, some Delhi high court staff, the first responders to the fire as well as the security personnel deployed at the judge's residence.Eight days after the incident, the CJI had constituted a panel comprising Punjab & Haryana chief justice Sheel Nagu, Himachal Pradesh CJ G S Sandhawalia and Karnataka HC's Justice Anu Sivaraman to conduct an inquiry into the allegations against Justice Varma. Under the memorandum of procedure, the CJI is the sole authority to decide the course of action depending on the contents of the report even though the panel's findings are not binding. If the report is adverse to Justice Varma, who has since been repatriated to Allahabad HC, the CJI could order lodging of an FIR for a formal investigation by police.The CJI, if he thinks fit, may also recommend to Union govt to initiate removal motion against the judge in case the panel has recorded specific findings of wrongdoing and his prima facie involvement in stashing of cash in the outhouse of his residence that caught fire.If the panel detects no evidence of wrongdoing on part of judge, then, too, the CJI could order a formal investigation or decide to close the case and allow Justice Varma to resume judicial work, which has been withdrawn since March 22.The fire broke out at 11.30pm on March 14. Delhi Police commissioner informed Delhi HC CJ D K Upadhyay the next day at 4.50pm, who in turn informed the CJI on March 16.

In his response to the HC CJ, Justice Varma had said, ""I unequivocally state that neither I nor any of my family members had stored or kept any cash or currency in that storeroom at any point of time. What baffles me is the absence of any sacks of allegedly burnt currency which were ever recovered or seized.""","A three-member judicial panel has submitted a voluminous report to CJI Sanjiv Khanna.

The Shankaracharya added that a reminder had also been sent, but no response came.""During his speech, he first targeted ruling party members and then made the comment against Manusmriti.
