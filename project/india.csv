"‘Worse than the British’: Kejriwal targets BJP, Congress in first major speech since Delhi debacle, invokes Bhagat Singh",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/worse-than-the-british-kejriwal-targets-bjp-congress-in-first-major-speech-since-delhi-debacle-invokes-bhagat-singh/articleshow/119380257.cms,"NEW DELHI: Making his first major public appearance since AAP’s defeat in the Delhi elections, Arvind Kejriwal has once again taken aim at INDIA bloc-ally, Congress. Speaking at AAP's 'Ek Shaam Shaheedon Ke Naam' event on Sunday, Kejriwal accused both the BJP and Congress of colluding, alleging that neither party values the contributions of national icons Bhagat Singh and BR Ambedkar .""We consider Bhagat Singh and Baba Saheb Ambedkar our ideals. There are pictures of both of them in our house and in every office of the Delhi and Punjab governments. The first thing the new government in Delhi did was to remove the pictures of both. We were waiting for them (BJP) to announce Rs 2,500 to women. But they removed the pictures of Bhagat Singh and Baba Saheb and put up pictures of their leaders first,"" Kejriwal said.He added, ""When we put up the pictures of these two, Congress protested that Gandhiji's picture was not put up. However, when the BJP removed the photos of these two, Congress did not say anything. There is a collusion between these two.""Kejriwal recalled how Bhagat Singh’s letters from jail were delivered to his comrades despite being critical of the British. In contrast, he alleged that his own letter from prison never reached the Lieutenant Governor and instead led to a show cause notice against him. ""Bhagat Singh had the freedom to write any letter, but I was not even allowed to write two lines,"" he said, calling the BJP ""worse than the British.""""I wrote a letter to LG that I was in jail, so Atishi should be allowed to hoist the flag. There was nothing wrong with this. I gave a letter to the jail superintendent, but the letter did not reach LG, and I got a show cause notice that how dare I write such a letter. Bhagat Singh had the freedom to write any letter, but I could not write a letter of two lines. You (BJP) are worse than the British,"" he said.AAP suffered a major electoral setback in Delhi, losing to the BJP, which secured 48 of the 70 seats. Kejriwal’s return to public life at the Shaheed Diwas event marks a significant moment for the party as it attempts to regain momentum. The event, held at the AAP headquarters, was attended by senior leaders, MLAs, councillors, and office-bearers.Kejriwal’s comments also reflect the deepening rift between AAP and Congress, who were allies in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections but turned into fierce rivals during the Delhi assembly polls. The campaign saw Rahul Gandhi launching scathing attacks against Kejriwal, accusing him of corruption and misgovernance. The Congress had alleged that AAP was responsible for the liquor scam and criticised Kejriwal for failing to maintain the legacy of previous Congress-led governments in Delhi.Also read: Have allies-turned-rivals dealt a deadly blow to opposition's INDIA bloc? The animosity between AAP and Congress had intensified in the run-up to the elections, with Kejriwal frequently hitting back at Gandhi’s allegations. ""Modi puts people in jail even by making fake cases like the liquor scam. Why haven't you and your family been arrested in open-and-shut cases like National Herald? How did Robert Vadra get a clean chit from BJP? It is better if you don't preach on fear and bravery,"" Kejriwal had said in response to Gandhi’s criticisms. He also accused Congress of working hand in hand with BJP to defeat AAP.","Kejriwal accused both the BJP and Congress of colluding, alleging that neither party values the contributions of national icons Bhagat Singh and BR Ambedkar.

It said the bill seeks to dilute constitutional provisions that guarantee equal rights and protection to all citizens, regardless of religion.As Centre prepares to bring the bill for discussion and passage in Parliament, Congress spokesperson Jairam Ramesh listed five reasons why it is ""deeply flawed"".He said the legislation reduces in stature, composition and authority all institutions created by previous laws to administer waqfs to deliberately deprive the ""community"" the right to administer its own religious traditions and affairs. ""Deliberate ambiguity has been introduced for determining who can donate their land for waqf purposesthus altering the very definition of waqf itself,"" he said.

NEW DELHI: Facing legal hurdles after disgruntled member state associations approached courts, the Boxing Federation of India ’s ( BFI ) forthcoming elections were on Friday “paused” by Returning Officer RK Gauba after incumbent Ajay Singhled governing body informed the RO that it is seeking urgent intervention against the “contradictory orders” issued by the judiciary.The BFI’s elections are scheduled for March 28 in Gurugram.“The president of the BFI has communicated...since these orders have the potential to disrupt the ongoing electoral process/schedule, we are taking steps to approach the superior courts for urgent intervention. Therefore, it’s requested that further orders be awaited before the conflicting orders of the high courts are acted upon,” Gauba quoted Singh as saying in his order.The RO – a former Delhi high court judge – said that the election process would remain paused until the federation informs him of the steps taken in response to the court orders.“Thus, the process is paused till BFI informs of the action taken in the wake of the court orders,” Gauba wrote.Two days ago, the Delhi High Court had stayed the federation’s March 7 directive signed by Singh that “only duly-elected members of BFI’s affiliated units are authorised to represent their respective states in the elections”.The court had ruled on a petition filed by the Delhi Amateur Boxing Association (DABA), paving the way for its office-bearers Rohit Jainendra Jain and Neeraj Kant Bhatt to vote in the BFI’s annual general meeting (AGM) as Delhi boxing body’s representatives.On Thursday, another ruling by the Himachal Pradesh High Court allowed former sports minister Anurag Thakur to contest the BFI’s presidential election by staying his disqualification from the electoral college based on the March 7 circular, and directed Gauba to include the senior BJP leader’s name as one of the representatives from the Himachal boxing body to enable his candidature.It’s been learnt that the Maharashtra state boxing association has also filed a writ petition before the High Court of Judicature at Bombay, impleading the RO to stay the elections.",Boxing Federation of India ’s forthcoming elections were on Friday “paused’ by Returning Officer RK Gauba.

NEW DELHI: Boxing Federation of India’s (BFI) elections are heading towards an intriguing finish.Incumbent Ajay Singh and the opposing faction challenging his presidential candidacy are exercising every conceivable strategy to outmanoeuvre each other in this high-stakes electoral contest.After the initial triumph of having rejected former sports minister Anurag Thakur ’s bid to contest the federation’s elections following an unexpected office directive and suspending secretary general Hemanta Kalita and treasurer Digvijay Singh on allegations of corruption and favouritism, Singh-led BFI has been compelled to confront successive setbacks within a span of two days through various court orders, yielding the advantage to their opponents.On March 7, the Delhi high court had stayed the federation’s directive that only bonafide and duly-elected members of BFI’s affiliated units are authorised to represent their respective states in the forthcoming elections, scheduled for March 28 in Gurugram. The court had ruled on a petition filed by the Delhi Amateur Boxing Association (DABA), paving the way for its office bearers Rohit Jainendra Jain and Neeraj Kant Bhatt to vote in the BFI’s annual general meeting (AGM) as Delhi boxing body’s representatives.On Thursday, another ruling by the Himachal Pradesh high court allowed Thakur to contest the BFI’s presidential election by staying his disqualification from the electoral college based on the March 7 circular and directed Returning Officer – former Delhi high court judge R K Gauba – to include the senior BJP leader and four-time Lok Sabha MP’s name as one of the representatives from the Himachal boxing body to enable his candidature.A single judge bench of Justice Ajay Mohan Goel directed the BFI to extend the last date of submission of nominations so that Thakur can file his papers whilst permitting him to represent the Himachal Pradesh Boxing Association (HPBA) in the AGM and “fully participate therein”.Justice Goel ruled that the electoral college approved by the RO on March 12 and 13, which left out Thakur, “is prima facie bad and not sustainable in law”“In this backdrop, balance of convenience is also in favour of the petitioners and if interim, as prayed for by the petitioners is not granted, then irreparable loss shall be caused to them. As an ad-interim measure, this court stayed the operation of notice, dated 07.03.2025, as well as the rejection of nomination of one of the two nominated members namely, Mr. Anurag Singh Thakur. It also goes without saying that the election process will be subject to the final outcome of this writ petition or any other order that may be passed by the court in this application,” the order stated.The court ruled that prima facie, it was evident that the March 7 order by Singh was issued “without any authority and without any power”.Thakur was declared ineligible on the grounds that he wasn’t an elected member of the HPBA and can’t represent the state in the BFI’s AGM. The HPBA maintained that Thakur was an elected member of the state unit since 2008 and served “in different capacities, including chairman”.HPBA’s president Rajesh Bhandari will be another representative from the state, along with Thakur.Reacting to the development, a BFI source close to president Singh’s camp said that the next course of action will be decided after going through the 34-page order. “A lot will now depend on the RO. We have received both the court orders and the BFI’s legal team will go through them. We will certainly challenge them in the respective courts,” added the source.",Boxing Federation of India’s (BFI) elections are heading towards an intriguing finish.
