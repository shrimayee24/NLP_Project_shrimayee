NEW DELHI: As counting begins at 8am for Bihar’s 243 assembly seats, all eyes will be on Tarapur, where Deputy Chief Minister and BJP leader Samrat Chaudhary faces his first electoral test on a saffron ticket. He faces RJD’s Arun Shah and JS’s Santosh Singh.The seat, part of Munger district and falling under the Jamui parliamentary constituency, is being closely watched as a key indicator of the BJP’s attempt to consolidate non-Yadav OBCs and upper-caste voters in the state.For the last three assembly elections, Tarapur remained with the JD(U), represented by Mewa Lal Choudhary, who retained it in 2020. But under this year’s NDA seat-sharing arrangement, the constituency has gone to the BJP, setting up a fresh contest between Samrat Chaudhary, RJD’s Arun Shah, and Jan Suraj’s (JS) Santosh Singh.In the 2020 assembly election, JD(U)’s Mewa Lal Choudhary had defeated RJD’s Divya Prakash by 7,225 votes, securing 64,468 votes (36.93 per cent) against 57,243 (32.8 per cent). LJP’s Mina Devi and Independent Rajesh Kumar Mishra followed with over 11,000 and 10,000 votes respectively. Tarapur recorded a turnout of 55 per cent, with 1.74 lakh valid votes out of 3.17 lakh electors.Five years earlier, in 2015, JD(U)’s ML Choudhary had defeated HAM(S) candidate Sakuni Choudhary by nearly 12,000 votes, polling 66,411 (43.62 per cent) to 54,464 (35.77 per cent).This time, the focus is on whether Samrat Chaudhary - who belongs to the Koeri (non-Yadav OBC) community - can expand BJP’s social reach in a seat that has historically backed JD(U)’s local leadership. The result will also test how effectively the NDA has managed its transition after the latest round of seat swaps.","Counting begins at 8am for Bihar’s 243 assembly seats.

NEW DELHI: After three years of suspension of MGNREGS in West Bengal, the Centre is said to have told a key parliamentary panel that it will resume the flagship scheme in the state as per orders of Kolkata HC.According to sources, rural development secretary Shailesh Kumar Singh told the Public Accounts Committee that the Centre would follow the HC's judgment, after MPs raised the issue of continued halt to its implementation in the state. The Centre suspended the scheme in the state in 2022 after alleging irregularities in its implementation. While the Centre approached SC against the HC judgment, the apex court rejected the appeal.The Centre has since not announced how it planned to proceed on the issue given that it had exhausted the legal route.The PAC chaired by Congress MP KC Venugopal held a three-and-half-hour discussion on MGNREGS, and members across party lines like Praful Patel, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Shaktisinh Gohil, Jagdambika Pal, Dharmendra Yadav, are learned to have raised questions about the scheme's implementation, and the norms decided by the Centre.As the secretary declared that the Centre would follow the HC order, a Congress MP told the panel there had already been a big delay in resumption of the scheme as the HC judgment came a few months ago. He demanded that the resumption be done without any further loss of time.The suspension of MGNREGS in Bengal has resulted in a protracted political confrontation between the TMC of CM Mamata Banerjee and BJP.","The Centre suspended the scheme in the state in 2022 after alleging irregularities in its implementation.

Slow Traffic, Then Sudden Fireball: CCTV Captures The Delhi Red Fort Blast That Killed At Least 10

SRINAGAR: It took a doctor-cop to catch a “white-collar” terrorist network of doctors. When Jaish-e-Mohammed posters appeared overnight on Oct 19 across Nowgam-Bunpora in Srinagar, warning security forces of “dire consequences”, most residents brushed it off as a ghost from Kashmir’s violent past. For Srinagar SSP Dr GV Sundeep Chakravarthy, the signs were too deliberate — and too dangerous — to ignore.By dawn, he had ordered a case under UAPA, Explosive Substances Act, and Arms Act at Nowgam police station. CCTV footage combed frame by frame revealed three men. They were detained. Interrogation led to one name — Moulvi Irfan Ahmad of Shopian, who had led prayers at Nowgam mosque since 2020.Police teams moved fast. Ahmad’s Shopian home was searched. Another residence in Nowgam was examined. Digital footprints traced from his communications pointed to operatives beyond J&K — connections stretching into Haryana and UP.A team was dispatched. In coordinated follow-up action, police took custody of Muzammil Ahmad Ganaie, a doctor from Pulwama working in a Faridabad medical college and allegedly linked to the Jaish network. What had begun as an inquiry into wall posters turned into the exposure of a sophisticated cross-state, “white-collar” module.Three Nowgam residents were also held.A senior officer called the effort “a thorough forward-and-backward investigation that mapped every link in the chain”. “It was a good investigative effort that led to the arrest of doctors based in UP and Haryana. During questioning, more links were identified, which led to seizures, including IED-making material,” the officer said.For Chakravarthy, the 2014-batch IPS officer, this was another chapter in a career defined by frontline counterterror operations. Born in Kallur in Andhra Pradesh’s Kurnool, son of retired govt medical officer Dr GV Rama Gopal Rao and health department official PC Rangamma, he studied medicine at Kurnool Medical College and graduated in 2010. He served there briefly as a doctor before trading the stethoscope for the service revolver.On Aug 14, he received his sixth President’s Police Medal for Gallantry for his role in multiple antiterrorism operations in J&K. He took charge as SSP Srinagar on Apr 21 this year. The poster probe now stands as one of his most intricate investigations — one that allegedly peeled back layers of radicalisation and revealed an unlikely alliance of a moulvi, medics, and modules.","Jaish-e-Mohammed posters appeared overnight on Oct 19 across Nowgam-Bunpora in Srinagar.
