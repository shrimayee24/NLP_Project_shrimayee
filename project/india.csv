INDIA bloc names former SC judge Sudershan Reddy as its VP candidate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-bloc-names-former-sc-judge-sudershan-reddy-as-its-vp-candidate/articleshow/123396899.cms,"Justice (retired) BS Reddy with INDIA bloc leaders

Reddy as judge protected Constitution: Oppn

NEW DELHI: Dubbing the vice-presidential poll as an ""ideological battle"" to counter the assault on constitutional values, the joint opposition announced Tuesday former Supreme Court judge B Sudershan Reddy as its candidate to take on NDA's C P Radhakrishnan, underlining that Reddy is a ""consistent and courageous champion of social, economic and political justice"".The opposition, after a meeting at the residence of Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge , announced Reddy's candidature to end the suspense. ""Reddy... fully reflects the values that shaped our country's freedom movement so profoundly and the values on which our country's Constitution and democracy have been anchored.""All the values on which our Constitution has been anchored are under assault and, therefore, our collective and determined resolve to fight this election, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge read out from a joint statement, adding, ""B Sudershan Reddy is a pro-poor man, and in many of his judgments... he also protected the Constitution and fundamental rights."" Reddy was welcomed at Delhi airport by an opposition delegation in the evening. Opposition MPs will meet in Parliament's Central Hall Wednesday, while Reddy will file his nomination on Thursday.Source said at the meeting attended by K C Venugopal, Sharad Pawar (NCP-SP), M A Baby (CPM), Derek O'Brien (TMC), Kanimozhi (DMK), Sandosh Kumar (CPI), Dharmendra Yadav (SP), N K Premachandran (RSP), Sanjay Raut (Sena UBT), Rajaram Singh (CPI-ML) among others, Kharge merely announced the candidate's name, which was finalised during the discussions with allies through interlocutors Kharge, Venugopal and Jairam Ramesh late on Monday.The meeting on Monday remained inconclusive after DMK's nominee Mylswami Annadurai was objected to by TMC, which argued that the VP polls could not become a local Tamil Nadu affair, alluding to BJP's choice of C P Radhakrishnan. DMK did not press for it, sources said, in the interest of unity.But since the Trinamool brass was insistent on a non-political person, Congress is said to have recommended Reddy citing his judicial past and his strong social justice credentials. Sources said, none of the parties took a hard line on any issue to ensure that the rare unity in the anti-BJP axis was not broken. Kharge said, ""Whenever democracy and the Constitution are under attack, opposition parties unite to fight against it. ""CPI MP Sandosh Kumar said Reddy's nomination is an assertion that ""defence of the Constitution and democratic values is non-negotiable"", underlining Reddy is ""an eminent jurist whose record in upholding human rights and civil liberties is impeccable"".AICC data analytics department chairman Praveen Chakravarty posted photographs of working with Reddy, who was chairman of the expert group on Telangana caste survey that concluded recently.The opposition choice is also a political trap for Andhra-Telangana parties aligned with BJP, as opposition will try to embarrass YSRCP and TDP who are supporting Radhakrishnan. At the same time, BJP's Telangana MPs will have to manage a tightrope as ""Reddy is a known name in the state"". It is the same issue of optics that BJP through Radhakrishnan is seeking to foist on DMK, which is in the opposition camp.","Former Supreme Court judge B Sudershan Reddy to take on NDA's C P Radhakrishnan.

"PM, CMs, ministers to go if held for 30 days on serious charges, Amit Shah to move 3 Bills",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-cms-mins-to-go-if-held-for-30-days-on-serious-charges-bills/articleshow/123396626.cms,"Union home minister Amit Shah (File photo)

3 statute amendment bills today

Ministers facing

criminal charges

hinder good governance, says Shah

NEW DELHI: In a significant move, home minister Amit Shah will on Wednesday move a set of three bills providing for mandatory resignation or removal of the Prime Minister, chief ministers and ministers at the Centre and in states/UTs, if they have spent 30 consecutive days under arrest or detention, on an allegation of committing offences punishable with imprisonment extending to five years or more.However, nothing will prevent such PM, CMs or ministers from being subsequently appointed to the same office by President or governor, upon their release from custody.The timing of the amendments, two days before the end of Parliament's Monsoon session, and their implications caught political circles by surprise. The Representation of the People's Act, 1951 provides for the disqualification of members of state legislatures and Parliament if they are convicted with a sentence of two years or more. Convictions for serious offences such as corruption and drug trafficking result in disqualification irrespective of the duration of the sentence.There was so far no bar on ministers holding on to their offices after their arrests: something that was justified on the ground that no one deserves to be punished until proven guilty. Until a few years ago, ministers and CMs facing arrests, resigned. But the convention was of late followed more in breach with several ministers continuing in their posts after their arrests.The SC recently sought to reinstate the practice by forcing Tamil Nadu minister Senthil Balaji to step down.Shah, in the statement of objects and reasons of the bills, says the elected representatives, who represent hopes and aspirations of the people, are expected to act only in public interest and have character and conduct that is beyond any ray of suspicion.A minister, who is facing allegations of serious criminal offences, arrested and detained in custody, may thwart or hinder the canons of constitutional morality and principles of good governance and eventually diminish the constitutional trust reposed by people in him, Union minister Amit Shah said. The bills may be sent to a parliamentary panel for detailed scrutiny of provisions.The Constitution (One Hundred and Thirtieth Amendment) Bill states the PM, if under arrest or detention for 30 days on allegation of committing an offence punishable with jail term that may extend to five years or more, shall tender his resignation by the 31st day. ""If he does not tender his resignation, he shall cease to be PM with effect from the day falling thereafter,"" it adds.The same provisions will apply in case of a state or UT CM - the latter covered by two separate bills, Govt of Union Territories (Amendment) Bill, 2025 and Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation (Amendment) Act, 2025 - arrested for a straight 30 days for an offence carrying a prison sentence of five years or more.Even the ministers in the Council of States at Centre and in states/UTs will be bound by the same provisions. While a Union minister shall be removed from office by the President on advice of the PM, state or UT ministers shall be removed by the governor on advice of the CM.In recent past, then Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had refused to resign after he was arrested in a liquor 'scam' case and spent several months in jail. It was only after he was let out on bail that he stepped down and named Atishi as CM.","Home minister Amit Shah will on Wednesday move a set of three bills providing for mandatory resignation or removal of the Prime Minister, chief ministers and ministers at the Centre and in states/UTs.

K'taka cabinet approves internal quotas for SCs; 3 groups to share 17% reservation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ktaka-cabinet-approves-internal-quotas-for-scs-3-groups-to-share-17-reservation/articleshow/123395680.cms,"Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah (File photo)

BENGALURU: After decades of deliberations, agitations and commissions, Congress govt in Karnataka on Tuesday decided to rework the internal reservation structure for Scheduled Castes (SCs).An official announcement on this will be made during the ongoing assembly session on Wednesday.According to some cabinet ministers, the Justice Nagamohan Das Commission, which had studied internal reservation among the 101 castes within the SC community, originally suggested five categories to ensure a well-balanced representation. However, govt chose to simplify the matrix and restrict it to three categories only.According to the new framework, Madigas will receive 6% allocation, while Holeyas and Alemari castes will be eligible for 6% reservation jointly. The third category comprising Bhovi, Lambhani and others will be eligible for 5% reservation.Backward classes welfare minister Shivaraj Tangadagi described the cabinet decision as one that carries consensus and acceptance across communities. Law and parliamentary affairs minister H K Patil, who briefed the media after the cabinet meeting, called it a landmark moment in social justice policymaking.""The cabinet meeting came out with a fruitful decision, which makes all ministers such as K H Muniyappa, H C Mahadevappa, and G Parameshwara happy,"" he said.Former minister H Anjaneya, a long-time advocate for greater representation of the Madiga community, hailed the decision as historic. ""I welcome the state gov's decision to grant a 6% reservation to the Madiga community,"" he said, adding: ""Community members had anticipated a 7% reservation. However, they managed to secure 6%. This is a victory for the community's demand that persisted for the last 30 years.""The Madiga community, which has been at the forefront demanding equitable distribution within the SC quota, has historically argued that benefits of reservation were cornered disproportionately by a handful of castes.","Congress govt in Karnataka rework internal reservation structure for Scheduled Castes.
