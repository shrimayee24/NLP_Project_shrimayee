NEW DELHI: Maharashtra caretaker chief minister and Shiv Sena chief Eknath Shinde who had taken ill after a hectic election schedule, returned to Mumbai on Sunday after recuperating in his native village, Dare Tamb, in Satara.

Civil Surgeon Dr Yuvraj Karpe confirmed that Shinde was suffering from a respiratory tract infection , fever, and weakness, though his vital parameters were stable.“His blood pressure and pulse rate are normal, and tests for dengue and malaria were negative.

I had come here to rest after the hectic election schedule. I did not take any leave during my 2.5 years as the CM. People are still here to meet me. This is why I fell ill.

BJP's former Union minister Raosaheb Danve suggested that a combined electoral effort between the undivided Sena and BJP would have resulted in additional seat victories.Meanwhile, Shiv Sena legislator Gulabrao Patil suggested that his party, under Eknath Shinde's leadership, could have secured 90-100 constituencies had Ajit Pawar's NCP not been part of the coalition, prompting strong opposition from Ajit Pawar's faction.Although Shiv Sena and NCP have selected Eknath Shinde and Ajit Pawar as their respective legislature party leaders, the BJP has yet to convene its legislature party meeting to formally nominate their chief ministerial candidate.Additionally, a high-ranking Mahayuti official, as quoted by PTI, indicated that the coalition partners will collectively determine whether December 5 will witness only the swearing-in of the chief minister and deputy chief ministers, or if it will include ministers as well.",A senior BJP leader reportedly confirmed on Sunday night that Devendra Fadnavis has been finalised as Maharashtra's next chief minister.

'Madam is busy': When Najma Heptulla waited an hour to talk to Sonia Gandhi during call from Berlin,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/madam-is-busy-when-najma-heptulla-waited-an-hour-to-talk-to-sonia-gandhi-during-call-from-berlin/articleshow/115865129.cms,"Najma Heptulla and Sonia Gandhi (Picture credit: X/Agencies)

Former Rajya Sabha deputy chairperson Najma Heptulla recounted waiting for an hour on an international call from Berlin to inform then-Congress president Sonia Gandhi about her election as the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) president in 1999, only to be told, “Madam is busy.”Heptulla writes in her autobiography In Pursuit of Democracy : Beyond Party Lines that she immediately informed then-Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee after her election, and he was elated by the news. “When he heard the news, he was delighted—first, because the honor had come to India, and second, because it had come to an Indian Muslim woman. He said, ‘You come back, and we will celebrate.’” She also promptly connected with the vice president’s office, where the response was equally enthusiasticHowever, her efforts to share the milestone with Sonia Gandhi were met with frustration. “When I called the Congress president, her staff responded with, ‘Madam is busy.’ Despite explaining that the call was international, I was told, ‘Please hold the line.’ I waited for a full hour, but Sonia never came on the line to speak to me,” she writes.“I pointed out that I was calling from Berlin, an international call. The staffer simply said, ‘Please hold the line.’ I waited for a full hour, but Sonia never came on the line to speak to me,” Heptulla writes.She expressed her disappointment, saying, “After that call, I didn’t tell her anything. Before forwarding my name for the post of IPU president, I had sought her permission, and at the time, she gave her blessings.”Reflecting on the incident, she adds, “If every country, culture, and family has its special moments—events so important and personal that they transcend the normal flow of daily life—this was one such moment for me. But it left a sense of rejection in my psyche forever.”Heptulla claims this incident marked a turning point within the Congress party . She alleges that a “new coterie of inexperienced sycophants” began handling party affairs, demoralizing veteran members.She eventually left the Congress following reported differences with Sonia Gandhi and joined the BJP in 2004. After her IPU election, the Vajpayee government elevated her ministerial rank to cabinet level and allocated funds for IPU-related travel.Heptulla also criticised the Congress party’s communication style under Sonia Gandhi’s leadership, contrasting it with Indira Gandhi’s accessibility. “Indira Gandhi used to keep an open house. She was accessible to rank-and-file members,” she writes. In her view, junior staff under Sonia Gandhi restricted access, hampering party communication and contributing to its decline. She also notes that Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi were not active in politics at the time.","Former Rajya Sabha deputy chairperson Najma Heptulla recounted waiting for an hour on an international call from Berlin to inform then-Congress president Sonia Gandhi about her election as the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) president in 1999. “When I called the Congress president, her staff responded with, ‘Madam is busy.’ I waited for a full hour, but Sonia never came on the line to speak to me,” she writes.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115866604,imgsize-1383840,width-400,resizemode-4/115866604.jpg"

She also responded to BJP accusations, which blamed former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal for the removal of the marshals starting in November 2023.Atishi clarified that Kejriwal had, in fact, opposed the removal, referencing a letter from October 2023, in which the CM instructed that the marshals should remain in service, and called for disciplinary action against officials who had withheld their salaries.She accused the LG of removing the marshals without regard for public safety, a decision she said was politically motivated and harmful to the welfare of the marshals and their families.BJP leaders in the assembly dismissed the AAP’s narrative, insisting that the removal of the marshals was carried out under Kejriwal’s direction, and now the AAP was merely playing politics with the issue of their reinstatement.Gupta sought answers from Atishi saying the AAP government deployed bus marshals and then removed them.BJP MLA Abhay Verma questioned the ruling party’s ability to resolve the issue, asking why the AAP government, in power for nearly a decade, had failed to bring back the marshals.Urban development minister Saurabh Bharadwaj, however, highlighted that the regularization of bus marshals fell under the jurisdiction of the LG, as it involved ""services"" and ""law and order"" matters, areas where the Delhi government has limited authority.","Delhi chief minister Atishi says Aam Aadmi Party would not field a candidate against BJP’s leader of opposition, Vijender Gupta.
