Goa: 23 Killed In Arpora Nightclub Fire; Cylinder Blast Suspected, CM Sawant Vows Strict Action

23 died in basement ‘due to suffocation’, 2 bodies found on stairs

PANAJI: Tragedy struck Goa's popular after-hours party scene just before midnight on Saturday, killing 25 people - five of them tourists - and injuring six inside a nightclub in Arpora that turned into a fireball within seconds of electric firecrackers hitting the wooden ceiling of the first floor as a belly-dancer performed.The victims in the blaze at Birch by Romeo Lane, 16km from Panaji, included four of a family from UP's Ghaziabad. Of the injured, five are being treated at Goa Medical College and Hospital. Police said 150 guests were at the club for the weekend event.DGP Alok Kumar said four club staffers - chief general manager Rajiv Modak, gate manager Priyanshu Thakur, bar manager Rajveer Singhania, and general manager Vivek Singh - were arrested. Goa Police registered an FIR against the club's Delhi-based owners, Saurabh Luthra and Gaurav Luthra, charging them with culpable homicide not amounting to murder. A police team is in Delhi with a warrant to arrest the duo.CM Pramod Sawant said his government instituted a magisterial inquiry to find out the lapses that resulted in the tragedy and submit a report within a week.The BJP govt also suspended three officials - ex-director of panchayats Siddhi Halarnkar, ex-state pollution control board member secretary Shamila Monteiro, and former Arpora-Nagoa panchayat secretary Reghuvir Bagkar - for allegedly allowing the nightclub to function without adhering to safety norms.The blaze occurred around 11.45 pm, with a portion of the ceiling catching fire. As flames coursed through the roof overhead, the guests and performers bolted. While most of them were able to step out of the club, those trapped inside reached the basement after the exit caught fire.CM Pramod Sawant said the chief secretary and DGP Alok Kumar would initiate disciplinary action against the suspended officials. The CM dismissed initial suspicion of a cylinder blast, saying a preliminary investigation by police and fire services department suggested electric firecrackers triggered the blaze. ""The fire spread quickly because of the wooden ceiling,"" he said.Of the victims, 23 died in the basement of suspected suffocation. Police found the bodies in a pile. Two charred bodies were on the staircase. The basement does not have ventilation.Sawant said except for the five tourists who died, the deceased were employees of the club - from Assam, Bengal, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Uttarakhand, UP and Nepal. Postmortem was conducted on 17 bodies by evening; five were handed over to families. State government sealed Romeo Lane at Vagator, a nightclub belonging to the same owners, after an inquiry revealed inadequate fire-safety measures.PM Narendra Modi announced Rs 2 lakh in ex gratia to the next of kin of each of the deceased, and Rs 50,000 each to the injured.CM Sawant separately declared Rs 5 lakh in compensation for each death and Rs 50,000 to the injured.","Five of the 25 people killed were tourists from Uttar Pradesh and Nepal.

PANAJI: In a major tragedy ahead of the peak tourist season, 25 people were killed, including five tourists, after an inferno tore through a popular nightclub, Birch by Romeo Lane, at Arpora, late on Saturday night. Four of the deceased were from the same family in Delhi, and three of them were women, while one tourist was from Karnataka. The fire — the deadliest in Goa’s history — also injured six persons, five of whom are undergoing treatment at GMC.Goa police have registered an FIR against the owners of the club, Saurabh Luthra and Gaurav Luthra, and others for culpable homicide not amounting to murder.CM Pramod Sawant said that Goa police have issued an arrest warrant, and that a police team has already left for Delhi to arrest the accused.Meanwhile, DGP Alok Kumar said that police have arrested four staffers of the club — chief general manager Rajiv Modak, 49, and gate manager Priyanshu Thakur, 32, both from Delhi; and bar manager Rajveer Singhania, 32, and general manager Vivek Singh, 27, both from UP.When the incident took place at around 11.45pm, there were over 150 tourists attending a Saturday night event at the club. A preliminary investigation conducted by Goa police and the fire department concluded that the fire broke out after electric firecrackers hit the wooden ceiling during the event.When the fire first sparked from the ceiling, the performers stopped the event, and within minutes, tourists made a dash for their lives. While most of them were able to leave the club, those who were trapped inside due to the flames tried to escape by entering the basement area through a small staircase when the exit door caught fire.Sawant said that there was no blast at the club and that electric firecrackers were the cause of the fire.“Due to the wooden ceiling, the fire spread quickly inside the club,” he said.A total of 23 people died in the basement due to suffocation, and when police and fire personnel reached there after dousing the fire, they were shocked to see bodies lying over each other. The basement of the club did not have any ventilation, and this caused the people to suffocate.It took two hours to remove the bodies from the basement and shift them to the hospital. Police recovered two charred bodies lying on the staircase.Sawant said that except for the five tourists who died in the fire, the rest of the deceased were employees of the club from Assam, Bengal, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and Nepal. Postmortem examinations have been conducted on 17 bodies, and five have been handed over to their family members for final rites.State govt on Sunday also sealed Romeo Lane at Vagator, a nightclub belonging to the same owners, after the mamlatdar found that they don’t have adequate fire safety measures at the nightclub.Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that Rs 2 lakh ex gratia would be given to the next of kin of each of the deceased, and that the injured would be given Rs 50,000. Sawant also announced an ex gratia amount of Rs 5 lakh to the next of kin of the deceased and Rs 50,000 for the injured.","Five tourists among the 25 people killed in Goa nightclub fire.
