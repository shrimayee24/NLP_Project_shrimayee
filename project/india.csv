Hostile opposition skipping inauguration signals legislative challenge for government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hostile-opposition-skipping-inauguration-signals-legislative-challenge-for-government/articleshow/110883765.cms,"NEW DELHI: The absence of opposition members apart from Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge at Sunday's swearing-in and the INDIA bloc 's reluctance to acknowledge defeat in the election are seen as pointers to frosty relations between the opposition and the governing alliance in the coming months, which could translate into friction in Parliament.Political watchers believe NDA may not have a honeymoon period that usually comes after elections and the Modi government may have to depend more on executive actions to push ahead with its reform agenda instead of legislative action.In the past, the opposition has accused government of pushing through several legislations in Parliament without adequate discussion with analysts expecting that with fewer MPs on the treasury benches, some legislative actions may have to be either put on the backburner or pushed only after consensus, which may not be easy.In fact, it also raises the prospect of some key moves, such as labour reforms through the new codes, being held up as new rules have not been notified with some states not responding to the draft rules.Government sources said despite NDA having a clear majority and BJP being the largest party by a long margin, Congress and its partners have not conceded defeat and are instead going to town portraying themselves as victors.On the eve of the swearing-in, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee had said, ""This government is being formed undemocratically and unconstitutionally. We cannot give our best wishes to this government. We give our best wishes to the country and people.""Government sources confirmed that all opposition parties were invited and phone calls were made to ensure their presence. However, their absence was another example of their dislike for Modi, sources said. Soon after his election as leader of the NDA parliamentary party, Modi has sought consensus and respect for all parties.The mood in the governing camp is, however, upbeat with government watchers arguing that the Modi administration will not be hobbled or shy away from taking steps to improve the overall functioning. The filed is wide open, they said.",The absence of opposition members apart from Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge at Sunday's swearing-in and the INDIA bloc's reluctance to acknowledge defeat are seen as pointers to frosty relations.

Narendra Modi Takes Oath As India's Prime Minister For Historic Third Consecutive Term

First session

NEW DELHI: A day after taking oath of office for a historic third consecutive term , Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday assigned portfolios to his 71 council of ministers .The new Union Cabinet held its first meeting at the PM's residence in the evening following which the full list of portfolios was released.Signalling continuity, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday retained Amit Shah, Rajnath Singh, Nirmala Sitharaman and S Jaishankar in charge of the four high-profile ministries - Home, Defence, Finance and External Affairs - respectively in his new government.The four ministers in charge of these portfolios make up the crucial Cabinet Committee on Security headed by the prime minister.Among new entrants to the Union Cabinet, former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has got Agriculture and Rural Development Ministries, while BJP president J P Nadda has returned to the Health Ministry, a portfolio he had held in the Modi government's first term before he took charge of the ruling BJP first as working president in 2019 and then as the full-fledged president in 2020.Among the five members of the BJP's allies in the Union Cabinet, JD(Secular)'s H D Kumaraswamy has got Heavy Industries, and Steel ministries, Jitan Ram Manjhi (HAM-Secular) has Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Ministry, and Lalan Singh (Janata Dal-United) Panchayati Raj, Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying Ministries.TDP's K Rammohan Naidu has got the Civil Aviation Ministry and LJP (Ram Vilas) leader Chirag Paswan has been allocated the Food Processing Industries Ministry.Among Ministers of State with Independent Charge, BJP ally and RLD leader Jayant Chaudhary has been allocated Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Ministry and Shiv Sena leader Jadhav Prataprao Ganpatrao will handle Ayush Ministry.The PM Modi 3.0 council of ministers include representation from all corners of the country as well as social groups.It has 27 ministers from Other Backward Classes, 10 from Scheduled Castes, 5 from Scheduled Tribes and 5 from minorities.A record 18 senior ministers will be heading ministries.Modi Cabinet 3.0 includes 43 ministers who have served 3 terms or higher in Parliament, with 39 having been ministers in central government before. The list includes multiple former chief ministers and 34 ministers who have served in state legislatures and 23 having worked as ministers in states.There are also 33 first-timers in the ranks. Seven first-time ministers in the Modi government belong to the allies: TDP's K Rammohan Naidu and Chandrasekhar Pemmasani; JDU's Lalan Singh and Ram Nath Thakur, RLD's Jayant Chaudhary, LJP's Chirag Paswan and HD Kumaraswamy of the JD(S).The new faces also include Suresh Gopi, the actor-turned-politician who scripted history by becoming the first BJP MP from Kerala.BJP's NDA partners have got five cabinet ministerial berths this time, as against none in the outgoing government, given the party's dependence on allies for a majority in the Lok Sabha. While the outgoing council of ministers had two ministers of state from BJP's allies -- Anupriya Patel of the Apna Dal (S) and Ramdas Athawale of the RPI(A) -- this time, there are two ministers of states with independent charge and four ministers of state (MoS).As per the Constitution of India, the total strength of the council of ministers cannot exceed 15% of the total number of Lok Sabha MPs.The strength of the 18th Lok Sabha is 543 members and hence the council of ministers cannot be more than 81.The 2024 Lok Sabha election results were announced by the Election Commission of India on June 4, the BJP won 240 seats and the Congress 99 seats. BJP had won 303 seats in the 2019 general elections and 282 seats in the 2014 general elections.The NDA's tally is 293 seats -- well above the majority mark of 272 -- and opposition INDIA bloc 234.As per media reports citing sources, the first session of the 18th Lok Sabha will begin from June 18 with President Droupadi Murmu expected to address a joint sitting of both Houses on June 21.The MPs in the Lower House are expected to take oaths on June 18-19, following which the Speaker will be elected on June 20.","Narendra Modi takes oath of office for third consecutive term. No change in CCS composition. PM retains Amit Shah, Rajnath Singh, Nirmala Sirmar and S. N. Sitharaman.

BJP set to name new Odisha chief minister today,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/bjp-set-to-name-new-odisha-chief-minister-today/articleshow/110883674.cms,"BJP is set to name Odisha's new chief minister on Tuesday at the first meeting of its newly elected MLAs in the presence of Union ministers Rajnath Singh and Bhupender Singh Yadav. The saffron party won 78 seats in the 147-member assembly, putting it on course to form its first govt in the state.Brajarajnagar MLA Suresh Pujari, state BJP president Manmohan Samal, and MLAs Mohan Majhi and Mukesh Mahaling are among the contenders for the chief minister's post, though the possibility of a surprise pick can't be ruled out. BJP insiders said the non-controversial and soft-spoken Pujari was a strong contender. A former state president of BJP, the ex-MP has worked earlier as BJP secretary in charge of Tripura and Bengal.Cutouts of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who will attend the swearing-in on Wednesday, have come up in Bhubaneswar. Many Union ministers, CMs of NDA-governed states and outgoing Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik are likely to attend the event. BJP functionaries asked people to be part of the ceremony at Bhubaneswar's Janata Maidan and light two lamps in their houses to mark the beginning of a ""double engine"" government.Sources said before taking oath, the CM-designate would visit Jagannath temple in Puri. All four temple gates are likely to be reopened to the public the day the new govt takes office, BJP sources said. It was a poll promise of the saffron party. The temple authorities have restricted entry to one gate since the Covid pandemic.","Suresh Pujari, state BJP president Manmohan Samal, and MLAs Mohan Majhi and Mukesh Mahaling are among the contenders for the chief minister's post.

Buzz of exit as MoS leaves Gopi firefighting,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/buzz-of-exit-as-mos-leaves-gopi-firefighting/articleshow/110883985.cms,"THRISSUR: BJP ’s first-ever MP from Kerala and junior tourism and petroleum minister Suresh Gopi was left firefighting a controversy on Monday surrounding speculation about his alleged remark to some Malayalam channels the previous day that he hoped to be relieved of his responsibilities soon so that he could act in films. “A few media platforms are spreading the incorrect news that I am going to resign from the council of ministers of the Modi govt. This is grossly incorrect. It is a matter of pride for me to be in the council of ministers, and to represent the people of Kerala,” he wrote on social media.Gopi clarified that he was committed to working for the development of Kerala, especially Thrissur. By then, Congress functionaries in Kerala had latched on to the confusion triggered by reports about Gopi’s plan. Posting video clips of the actor-politician, elected to Parliament from Thrissur in a breakthrough for BJP after years of trying, they suggested that his remark reflected a rift in the saffron party.Some speculated that Gopi and his supporters weren’t satisfied with him being made a junior minister given the enormity of his electoral achievement. They said the BJP rank and file in Thrissur had expected at least a portfolio with independent charge for the 65-year-old, if not a cabinet berth.Sources said several senior BJP functionaries of Kerala, including P K Krishnadas, K K Gopalakrishnan, M T Ramesh and A N Radhakrishnan, met Gopi on Monday morning to dissuade him from seeking an early exit from the third Modi govt. Gopalakrishnan told TOI over the phone from Delhi in the evening that there was no uncertainty over Gopi continuing to be a part of the ministry. The BJP brass in Thrissur district, too, rushed to quell talk of the actor-politician having second thoughts about being an MoS. They expressed confidence in the BJP bosses’ ability to “resolve the issue”.Sources close to Gopi said he had been asked to focus on handling the responsibilities he had been given, based on which he would be considered for a potential promotion to cabinet rank after around six months. BJP’s Kerala president K Surendran said the state had adequate representation in the Union cabinet with the inclusion of two ministers of state, former National Commission for Minorities vice-chairperson George Kurian being the other.","Suresh Gopi, BJP’s first-ever MP from Kerala and junior tourism and petroleum minister, was left firefighting a controversy on Monday.

NDA work brought it back; oppn not an adversary: Bhagwat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/nda-work-brought-it-back-oppn-not-an-adversary-bhagwat/articleshow/110884414.cms,"NAGPUR: RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on Monday said that NDA 's return to power after a decade when it was in office was a testimony to the good things that happened on its watch, even as he cautioned the political class not to treat difference of opinion as disputes and emphasised the need for evolving a consensus on the challenges facing the country.In his first public address post Lok Sabha poll results, Bhagwat criticised all sides for using falsehoods and using vituperative language during the campaign, saying the electoral discourse violated the decency that parties are expected to observe. “Your opponent is not an adversary, he only represents a counter viewpoint,” Bhagwat said as he expressed dismay over using technology for promoting false narratives and even “dragging RSS” into the electoral combat.“Elections are a necessity in a democracy and two sides compete against each other. However, there should be a degree of restraint, which should not be forgotten. Technology was used to spread lies about RSS which is a gross misuse of knowledge. The noble use knowledge for good, the evil misuse it,” he said.He praised the NDA govt for its performance in diverse fields. “It is a fact that we have done well on many counts in the period. Going by the parameters used by the modern countries to judge economic progress, we have done well. In defence, we are clearly stronger. We have done well in arts, culture, sports and science while the prestige of our country has gone up. Even developed foreign powers are now constrained to listen what we have to say,” said Bhagwat in remarks which may appear to be significant in view of the perception in certain quarters about RSS's unhappiness with BJP.However, Bhagwat, the top voice in Sangh Parivar, also cautioned saying that the process had to be carried forward to liberate country from the challenges still besetting it.Amidst the drift of a section of dalits to the opposition — a factor which is considered to have contributed to BJP's below-par performance — Bhagwat focused on bridging the caste divide by reiterating the words of the third sarsanghchalak, Balasaheb Deoras, who had said that untouchability needed to be removed ""lock, stock and barrel"".“Injustice has happened in society and it has left an acrimony in the mindset even today. There is no reference to untouchability in the scriptures like Vedas or Upanishads. It’s only a mind work of selfish elements. The custom may have been formed at some point for a particular time-period, but it needs to be eradicated now,” said Bhagwat. He called upon swayamsevaks to make it a point to establish personal relations with people of all social segments.Criticism of the election rhetoric formed an important part of Sangh chief's address at the passing-out ceremony of over 900 swayamsevaks, who completed the final stage of training at the Hedgewar Smruti Mandir campus here.“There is a dignity to the election process. People are being elected to Parliament and run our country. They should do so by consent. Need of the hour is to take everyone along. A contest is not a war in which criticism peaks to ugly levels. And this is not the way a campaign is run,” he said.Congress and PM have both accused each other of lowering the quality of discourse, with the former saying that PM used polarising themes. Bhagwat, however, refrained from blame-apportionment even as he echoed the concern over use of Artificial Intelligence and deep fakes to promote lies. He denounced the way technology was used to propagate falsehood.There are big challenges before the country, he said with a piece of advice for the govt over the state of affairs in Manipur. “Manipur continues to burn and nobody is paying attention towards the north-eastern state. Addressing Manipur should be the govt’s priority now. There was peace for nearly 10 years, and we thought the gun culture had ended and suddenly mayhem happened,” said Bhagwat. He also backed environmental protection, increasing green cover and water conversation.The guests of honour at the event included heir to the Piramal Group and Mukesh Ambani’s son-in-law Anand Piramal, Bharat Biotech chief Krishna Ella and actor Nana Patekar’s son Malhar.","Mohan Bhagwat criticised all sides for using falsehoods and using vituperative language during the campaign. “Your opponent is not an adversary, he only represents a counter viewpoint,” he said.

"In a first, a Buddhist to head minority affairs ministry",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-a-first-a-buddhist-to-head-minority-affairs-ministry/articleshow/110883861.cms,"NEW DELHI: In Kiren Rijiju , minority affairs ministry has for the first time got a Buddhist as its head. He will be helped by George Kurian, a Christian from Kerala and a surprise inclusion as he is not a member of either House of Parliament.The ministry was led, even under BJP govts , by Muslims, the largest minority community. However, the pattern broke when Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi resigned a day before his term as Rajya Sabha member ended in July 2022 and women and child development minister Smriti Irani got additional charge of the ministry. Irani is a Hindu married to a Parsi, and had a Christian, John Barla, assisting her as minister of state.The chairman of National Minorities Commission, Iqbal Singh Lalpura, is a Sikh and when he was appointed to the post, it marked a break from the pattern of the position mostly being helmed by Muslims.The choice of Rijiju could have been prompted by NDA lacking a Muslim in its ranks in both Houses. It is not clear whether any ally would like to address the issue by getting a member from the community elected to RS. In 2014, BJP appointed RS MP Najma Heptulla as minority affairs minister. She resigned in July 2016 when she was appointed governor of Manipur. Naqvi, who had been MoS since 2014, was elevated to the post of minister and served till 2019. He was re-appointed as minister in the Modi govt's second term till July 2022.Abdul Rahman Antulay was appointed by UPA govt as the first minority affairs minister in Jan 2006. He was followed by Salman Khurshid (May 2009 to Oct 2012) and K Rahman Khan (Oct 2012 to May 2014).","The ministry was led, even under BJP govts, by Muslims.

The former four-time MP chief minister, popularly known as ""mama"" (maternal uncle) and ""paon-paon wale bhaiya"" (foot soldier), assiduously worked on his 'soil of the soil' image and identified himself with the socio-economic concerns of farmers, villagers, women and children in the state.On Sunday, Chouhan became the Union cabinet minister for the first time in his more than three-decade-long political career.Born on March 5, 1959 in a farming family of Prem Singh Chouhan and Sundar Bai Chouhan at Jait village in Sehore district, Shivraj Singh Chouhan's political journey began with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) when he was just 13 years old.His leadership skills first came to the fore when he was elected president of the Model Higher Secondary School students' union in 1975.He participated in the underground movement against Emergency and was imprisoned in 1976-77 and also on many other occasions for political agitations and public causes.A volunteer of the RSS since 1977, Chouhan is a gold medalist in Masters of Philosophy from the Barkatullah University in Bhopal.He also served as general secretary of the BJP and president of the party's MP unit.Chouhan was first elected to the MP assembly from Budhni constituency in 1990.

By winning the Mandya Lok Sabha seat, Kumaraswamy has not only reclaimed the JDS's lost stronghold but also proven that the party remains a significant player in Karnataka politics through its alliance with the BJP. Kumaraswamy defeated Venkataramane Gowda of the Congress by a margin of 2,84,620 votes.Kumaraswamy, who is also the state JDS president, had hoped for a hung verdict in the 2023 assembly polls, which would allow him to emerge as a kingmaker or even a 'king' for the third time. However, his aspirations were shattered by his party's poor performance and the Congress's decisive victory. Faced with the necessity of keeping his party afloat and maintaining political relevance in the state, Kumaraswamy once again joined forces with the BJP to form an alliance before the Lok Sabha polls.Kumaraswamy's first passion was films, and he was drawn to cinema since his college days. He ventured into filmmaking and distribution, producing several successful Kannada films. In 2018, he famously said, ""I will be the king and not the kingmaker,"" and his words came true as he became the chief minister for the second time, despite the JDS finishing third in the polls.

Mix of old hands and new faces

Full list of the new council of ministers:

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi took the oath of office for a historic third consecutive term at 7.15pm on Sunday along with his council of ministers in an over 3-hour-long grand ceremony at the Rashtrapati Bhavan .As per media reports, the new Cabinet is scheduled to hold its first meeting on Monday evening at the Prime Minister's Lok Kalyan Marg residence.Ahead of the swearing-in ceremony , PM Modi had hosted a high tea for the 71 would-be council of ministers (which include 30 Cabinet ministers, 5 Ministers of State-Independent Charge, and 36 Ministers of State). The portfolios of the ministers have not yet been announced.The PM Modi 3.0 council of ministers include representation from all corners of the country as well as social groups. It has 27 ministers from Other Backward Classes, 10 from Scheduled Castes, 5 from Scheduled Tribes and 5 from minorities. A record 18 senior Ministers will be heading ministries.Modi Cabinet 3.0 includes 43 ministers who have served 3 terms or higher in Parliament, with 39 having been ministers in central government before. The list includes multiple former chief ministers and 34 ministers who have served in state legislatures and 23 having worked as ministers in states.There are also 33 first-timers in the ranks. Seven first-time ministers in the Modi government belong to the allies: TDP's K Rammohan Naidu and Chandrasekhar Pemmasani; JDU's Lalan Singh and Ram Nath Thakur, RLD's Jayant Chaudhary, LJP's Chirag Paswan and HD Kumaraswamy of the JD(S).The new faces also include Suresh Gopi, the actor-turned-politician who scripted history by becoming the first BJP MP from Kerala.The first-timers from the BJP are Kamlesh Paswan (Uttar Pradesh), Sukanta Majumder (West Bengal), Durga Das Uikey (Madhya Pradesh), Raj Bhushan Chaudhary (Bihar), Satish Dubey (Bihar), Sanjay Seth (Jharkhand), C R Paatil (Gujarat), Bhagirath Chaudhary (Rajasthan), Harsh Malhotra (Delhi), V Somanna (Karnataka), Savitri Thakur (UP).

Macron calls for snap parliamentary polls in France after loss in EU vote,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/macron-calls-for-snap-parliamentary-polls-in-france-after-loss-in-eu-vote/articleshow/110886585.cms,"What happened?

Why did he do it?

What's at stake?

How will the vote work?

What happens next?

Prez Emmanuel Macron threw French politics into disarray Sunday when he unexpectedly called for snap elections. The surprise move came after his party was battered by the far right in European Parliament elections. Macron dissolved the lower house of France 's Parliament and said the first round of legislative elections would be held on June 30.France's far-right, anti-immigrant National Rally party , led by Marine Le Pen and her protege, Jordan Bardella, surged to first place in elections for European Parliament with 31.4% of the vote. The centrist coalition led by Macron's Renaissance party came in a distant second with 14.6%. Macron acknowledged the crushing defeat. ""France needs a clear majority to move forward with serenity and harmony,"" he said, explaining why he had decided to call for legislative elections. That involved taking the rare move of dissolving the 577-seat National Assembly, a presidential prerogative. Macron is the first prez to do so since 1997.When Macron was elected to a second term in 2022, his party failed to win an outright majority. The centrist coalition he formed has since governed with a slim majority. Macron was under no obligation to dissolve parliament, even if the European vote left him a reduced figure with three years left in his presidential term.Analysts are still debating his motivations, although many suspect that he believed a dissolution had become inevitable: Conservative lawmakers were threatening to topple his govt. Jolting the country with a sudden election could be a way for Macron to prevent his opposition from organising - and to present voters with a stark choice between him or the far right.The move is seen as a gamble: If the National Rally repeats its performance in national elections, France could become nearly ungovernable, with Macron confronting a parliament hostile to his policies.The presidency is France's most powerful political office, with broad abilities to govern by decree. But the approval of parliament, and especially the National Assembly, is required on most big domestic policy changes and key pieces of legislation, like spending bills or amendments to the constitution. Unlike the Senate, the directly-elected National Assembly can topple a French cabinet with a no-trust vote. It also has more leeway to legislate and challenge the executive, and typically gets the final word if the two houses disagree on a bill.Macron's party and its centrist allies hold 250 seats in the National Assembly, short of the 289 required for an absolute majority. The National Rally party holds 88 seats, while the mainstream conservative Republicans have 61. A tenuous alliance of far-left, Socialist and Green lawmakers holds 149 seats. The remainder are held by smaller groups or independents.The elections for the 577 seats will be held in two rounds - the first on June 30 and the second on July 7. While in most cases the runoff will feature the top two vote-getters, on rare occasions it might feature three or even four candidates. Whoever gets the most votes wins .Despite its triumph in the European elections, it is unclear whether the National Rally can capture a significantly larger number of seats in the lower house. If Macron is unable to muster a strong parliamentary majority, he could find himself in a rare ""cohabitation"" scenario - where the presidency and National Assembly are on opposing political sides. In that scenario, Macron would be compelled to choose a PM of a different political party - which could potentially block much of his domestic agenda. Foreign policy, a presidential prerogative, would theoretically remain mostly untouched.","Macron dissolved the lower house of France's Parliament and said the first round of legislative elections would be held on June 30.

Efforts on for centrist alliance amid far-right surge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/efforts-on-for-centrist-alliance-amid-far-right-surge/articleshow/110886845.cms,"European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen (AFP image)

Brussels: European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen began trying to piece together a coalition on Monday after the far right surged in a European Parliament election.

Von der Leyen, the German president of the EU's powerful executive body, emerged strengthened from the four-day election across 27 countries, as her centre-right European People's Party (EPP) gained seats.

But to secure a second five-year term, von der Leyen needs the support of a majority of the EU's national parties and a working majority in the European Parliament. Provisional results on Monday gave the main parties that backed von der Leyen last time - the EPP, socialists and liberals - a total of 402 seats in the 720-member chamber. But that is regarded as too tight a majority for comfort. So von der Leyen may also reach out to the Greens, who suffered heavy losses, and Italy's nationalist PM Giorgia Meloni, with whom she has worked closely.

She said she aims to work with those who are ""pro-European, pro-Ukraine and pro-rule of law"" - a description she said applies to Meloni's Brothers of Italy but not to some other far-right parties.

The result is a remarkable reversal from 2019 European elections, when Meloni's then-marginal party secured just 6% of the vote.All eyes are now on what Meloni will do with her increased influence in Brussels.

According to a poll conducted by Swg and published by La7, Meloni's right-wing Brothers of Italy party was expected to emerge as the clear winner, securing between 27% and 31% of the vote, a significant increase from the mere 6% it obtained in 2019.

Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni delivers her speech during at an electoral rally.

Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is set to solidify her power after winning the vote in Italy for the European Parliament as far-right parties gained across the union.

Meloni’s right-wing Brothers of Italy party was on course to be the winner, according to a poll by Swg, published by La7, with the party expected to gain 27% to 31% compared to just over 6% in 2019.

According to the poll, the immediate runner-up was the left-wing Democratic Party, getting 21.5% to 25.5% of the vote, highlighting polarization between Italy’s two main political parties.

Matteo Salvini’s League and Antonio Tajani’s Forza Italia, founded by the late Silvio Berlusconi, both coalition partners in Meloni’s government, were projected to gain just under 10%.

Meloni’s projected victory is part of a slew of positive results for right-wing parties in Europe, led by France and Germany. Her position will be key in deciding vital alliances in the European Parliament — and selecting the successor to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who is running to retain her job.

Sunday night’s victory for Meloni is a significant vote of mid-term confidence from Italians, who rocketed her party to first place in the 2022 election with 26% of votes. In a bid to get more votes and have Italians rally around her persona, Meloni decided to top her party’s lists in the election even if she has no intention of leaving her job in Rome, telling them to simply vote for “Giorgia.”

","Right-wing party expected to win 27% of the vote, up from just 6% in 2013. Left- wing Democratic Party expected to get 21.5% of vote, down from 22% in 2012.

Labour pledges fresh inquiry into Thatcher's role in 1984 Operation Blue Star,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/labour-pledges-fresh-inquiry-into-thatchers-role-in-1984-operation-blue-star/articleshow/110776077.cms,"LONDON: The Labour party , which is forecast to win the July 4 UK general election, has pledged to hold an inquiry to investigate the role Britain played in storming the Golden Temple in June 1984 to remove Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and other Sikh militants, which triggered the assassination of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and the anti-Sikh riots.

Deputy Labour leader Angela Raynor said, “As we mark the 40th anniversary of the raid on the Golden Temple, Labour stands with the Sikh community in calling for an inquiry into the historic role Britain played. A Labour govt will work to determine the best way to find out the truth.”

Labour candidate for Coventry South Zarah Sultana said: “The role Thatcher’s govt played in this has been shrouded in secrecy. I stand with the Sikh community in calling for an inquiry to reveal the truth.” Labour candidate for Slough Tan Dhesi wrote on X: “40 years since Indira Gandhi ordered attack on Golden Temple complex…Still no justice for victims, nor UK inquiry (but Labour have promised) into Thatcher govt involvement!”

There has been no independent public inquiry into Margaret Thatcher’s involvement in Operation Blue Star , despite the release of classified documents in Jan 2014 implicating the UK govt.

Those files revealed that Britain had sent an SAS officer to India in Feb, ahead of Operation Blue Star, to draw up a plan to “remove Sikh extremists from the Golden temple”, having been asked to do so by Indira Gandhi.

The Heywood Review, commissioned by former PM David Cameron and published in Feb 2014, found no record of any UK assistance to the June 1984 operation other than the “limited military advice provided in mid-February”. The review, based on over 23,000 documents, said: “The recommendation and decision to agree this request were based on advice from the British high commission that it would be good for the bilateral relationship, whereas refusal would not be understood by Mrs Gandhi. There were significant differences between the actual June operation, and the advice from the UK military officer in Feb. The actual operation implemented by the Indian Army differed significantly from the approach suggested by the UK military officer.”

Many British Sikhs believe the Heywood Review is a whitewash and are calling for an independent judge-led public inquiry.
