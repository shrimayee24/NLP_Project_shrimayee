"Bogged down by internal issues, Mayawati appears uninterested in rebuilding BSP",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bogged-down-by-internal-issues-mayawati-appears-uninterested-in-rebuilding-bsp/articleshow/118692498.cms,"BSP supremo Mayawati’s key decisions, like snapping the alliance with SP immediately after 2019 Lok Sabha results, triggered speculation that extraneous factors like govt pressure over her legal woes were dictating her moves

NEW DELHI: The expulsion of heir apparent Akash Anand from BSP, after having been appointed and sacked as the party face twice in less than a year, is emblematic of the fall in the Dalit outfit's fortunes.The party was reduced to a solitary seat out of 403 in UP assembly in 2022 elections and then failed to win any of the 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state in 2024, even as its cadre and mid-rung leaders have streamed into rival SP in good numbers, boosting the strength of Akhilesh Yadav's ranks while also benefitting BJP in pockets.That encapsulates the misery of BSP over last five years - confusion at the top and erosion at the bottom. How did the party, once imperious in its appeal and strength and the byword for Dalit assertion, reach this miserable stage is difficult to fathom. But as it came after BJP's romp in UP in 2014 LS and 2017 assembly polls, Mayawati's key decisions like snapping the alliance with SP immediately after the 2019 Lok Sabha results in which it managed to win 10 seats, triggered speculation that extraneous factors like govt pressure over her legal woes were dictating her moves. Its choice of candidates in select constituencies in successive elections, which were seen as seeking to damage the BJP's rivals, only fanned the suspicion.As it stands today, BSP is without much of its votebase and without any legislative strength, while rivals BJP and SP both have benefitted from its fading from the scene. The 2024 LS polls have shown strong evidence that SP may emerge as a key destination for Dalit cadre, who are being wooed by BSP turncoats now leading the charge from Samajwadi benches.To many observers, signs of ""behenji"" bogged down in internal issues like succession, and suspicion of successors, instead of focusing on making a deft attempt at recouping the lost base suggests a distracted leader not keen on rebuilding. This is a confirmation of the party's obituaries that emerged in the wake of the 2022 UP election disaster. Few, including close followers, are willing to give the BSP another chance at re-emergence, despite the party retaining a wistful goodwill among its core vote base that is drifting to other options.As a labour of love of the tireless Kanshi Ram, BSP was a trailblazer, the first of the political platforms of Dalits which captured the imagination of the downtrodden and then showed enough realpolitik to become an indispensable political player. Anchored in the largest state of UP, it had appeal across states and became a sub-regional force in many of them. If it was not a player, it was a good enough spoiler. And if it was not a political choice of social groups, it asserted itself as a moral authority on emancipation. Now, BSP risks being nothing than a spent force all around.",The expulsion of heir apparent Akash Anand from BSP is emblematic of the fall in the Dalit outfit's fortunes.

According to the police, she had been living alone at her ancestral home in Vijayanagar, Rohtak, for the past five months and had attended a wedding last week.Earlier in the day, Savita Devi reached the mortuary ahead of Himani’s postmortem and expressed dissatisfaction with the police investigation.

"'Cover blown': Congress's EAGLE team accuses EC of voter list fraud, claims BJP benefiting from duplicate IDs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cover-blown-congresss-eagle-team-accuses-ec-of-voter-list-fraud-claims-bjp-benefiting-from-duplicate-ids/articleshow/118688977.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Congress on Monday accused the Election Commission (EC) of being complicit in large-scale voter list manipulation, alleging that duplicate voter ID numbers have been used to favor the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The allegations were made by the party’s Empowered Action Group of Leaders and Experts (EAGLE), which has called the issue a grave threat to India’s democratic fabric.""The cover is now blown. It is clear that the ruling BJP wins or attempts to win elections by manipulating voter lists in connivance with the Election Commission. Which is why the process of appointment of the Election Commissioners is so critical to the Narendra Modi government that it subverted a Supreme Court ruling to have a balanced committee to appoint Election Commissioners,"" the Congress said in a post on X.The Congress had set up an eight-member team EAGLE last month to keep a “bird’s eye view” of elections in the country and “monitor the conduct of free and fair elections by the Election Commission”. The panel includes Congress leaders Ajay Maken, Digvijaya Singh, Abhishek Manu Singhvi, Praveen Chakravarty, Pawan Khera, Gurdeep Singh Sappal, Nitin Raut and Challa Vamshi Chand Reddy.According to the statement by the EAGLE, multiple voters were found registered under the same voter ID number within the same constituency and even across different states. The party called this an unprecedented violation of electoral integrity, comparing it to multiple vehicles being registered under the same license plate number.During the Maharashtra assembly elections held in 2024, the Congress claimed the EC registered an astonishing 40 lakh new voters within just five months—far exceeding the 32 lakh new voter registrations recorded over the entire previous five-year period (2019-2024).“These new voters, suspiciously, seem to have voted overwhelmingly for the BJP-led alliance in Maharashtra, significantly impacting the election results in their favor,” the Congress alleged.The Congress further claimed that when initially confronted with evidence of duplicate voter IDs, the EC dismissed concerns, stating that a voter ID number may be repeated across states but remains unique within a state. However, subsequent findings contradicted this claim, exposing instances of identical voter IDs being used within the same constituency. The party accused the EC of deliberate silence following these revelations.The Congress alleged that the ruling BJP has manipulated the electoral process in collaboration with the EC to secure victories. The party also criticised the Modi government for overriding a Supreme Court directive aimed at ensuring a balanced appointment process for Election Commissioners.“This is a grave danger to India’s democracy,” a statement from the Congress read. “Babasaheb Ambedkar envisioned an independent Election Commission to safeguard elections from executive interference. We will not let this issue fade away and will pursue legal, political, and legislative remedies,” it said.",The Congress has accused the Election Commission of being complicit in large- scale voter list manipulation.
