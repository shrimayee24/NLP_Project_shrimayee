'Practice before preaching ... ': Assam CM Himanta hits back at Tejashwi for 'Chinese version of Yogi' remark,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/practice-before-preaching-assam-cm-himanta-hits-back-at-tejashwi-for-chinese-version-of-yogi-remark/articleshow/112948919.cms,"NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma hit back at Tejashwi Yadav over his "" Chinese version of Yogi "" remark, saying the RJD leader ""should have implemented a four-hour break when he was in power in Bihar"".Earlier, taking a dig at Sarma over the Assam assembly's decision to do away with the two-hour namaz break for Muslim MLAs, Tejashwi said that the BJP leader has become a ""Chinese version of Yogi (referring to the UP CM) in an attempt to ""gain cheap popularity"".""Tejashwi Yadav is criticising me but I want to ask him...is there any such practice in Bihar? You (Yadav) should have implemented four-hour break when you were deputy chief minister of Bihar. Practice it first before preaching,"" Sarma retorted to the Bihar's ex-deputy CM, according to news agency PTI.The Assam CM also advised Tejashwi, who also happens to be ex-Bihar CM Lalu Prasad Yadav 's son, to ""practice before preaching"".""I will re-implement the two-hour Jumma break, if those who are advising me first put into practice a four-hour break in their respective states,"" the BJP's firebrand leader added.Before Himanta's response, the BJP flayed Tejashwi for his ""racist comment"" and asked Congress leader Rahul Gandhi -- who is Tejashwi's ally in the INDIA bloc -- if he would part ways with the RJD after the ""hateful"" remark.""Tejashwi Yadav labels Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma as a ""Chinese"" because he is an Assamese and from the North-East! This reflects racist mentality of the INDI Alliance & it seems Sam Pitroda has taken over mindspace of Tejaswi when he makes such racist comments Does Rahul Gandhi , Gaurav Gogoi endorse this as ""Muhabbat ki Dukaan"" Will they end ties with RJD for such unconstitutional, anti Bharat Jodo, racist and hateful comments ?"" BJP leader Shehzad Poonawalla asked in a post.The entire controversy stems from the Assam assembly's decision to discontinue a two-hour namaz break practice for Muslim MLAs.Backing the assembly's decision, the Assam CM said that excluding Assam assembly, there is no provision of such practice of the British legacy from 1937 anywhere including in Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha.""Doing away with the two-hour Jumma break was not chief minister's decision but it is the decision of all Hindu and Muslim legislators. When the Assembly Speaker on Friday announced it, no Muslim MLA in the House raised any protest. There are 25 Muslim MLAs in Assam assembly out of total 126 legislators,"" he said.Sarma also said that no legislators in Assam, committed to the development of the country, had any issue with the decision, and only those from outside the state have raised questions.","Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma hit back at Tejashwi Yadav over his "" Chinese version of Yogi "" remark.

He also accused PM Modi of apologising just to get away with the controversy.""This is a political apology, a political moment.They are asking for an apology to get away with it. Apologisng will not compensate for the insult to Chhatrapati, it will never be enough. If the Prime Minister sincerely apologizes, then he should have apologized to the nation 5-10 years ago when 40 of our soldiers were killed in Pulwama, causing widespread grief,"" Raut said.""Forty soldiers were killed at once due to your failure. Even today, killings continue in Jammu and Kashmir, and the promise of homecoming for our Kashmiri Pandits has not been fulfilled; you should apologize for that too. You have lied so many times. You should apologise to the nation every day, but you haven't. This is Maharashtra; Maharashtra does not forgive anyone, especially in matters related to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj . So, you have no other option but to apologise,"" he added.Raut's reaction came a day after PM Modi said aplogised to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and those hurt by the collapse of the 17th-century warrior king’s statue at Rajkot Fort in Sindhudurg district of Maharashtra.""Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj is not just a name for me, for us Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj is our idol. Whatever happened in Sindhudurg a few days ago...today I bow and place my head at the feet of my beloved god Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and apologise,"" PM Modi said while addressing a rally in Maharasthra's Palghar.A statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, unveiled around nine months ago on December 4 last year by PM Modi on the occasion of Navy Day at Rajkot Fort at Malvan in Sindhudurg district, collapsed on Monday.CM Eknath Shinde described the incident as ""unfortunate"" and promised to reinstall it, saying that ""due to strong winds of around 45 kmph"", the statue ""erected by the Navy...fell and got damaged"". The fall of the statue triggered a massive political firestorm in the state as opposition slammed the state government, alleging it had paid little attention to the quality of work. Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Aaditya Thackeray criticised the ruling BJP government, expressing disbelief that even the revered figure's monument could fall victim to alleged corruption within the BJP's ranks.""It is unimaginable that the statue of our deity, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj would also be a subject of the BJP's corruption,"" Thackeray stated in his post.The opposition leader further accused the BJP of attempting to shift the blame onto the Indian Navy. He pointed out a pattern of favouritism towards certain contractors, subpar quality of work, and inaugurations timed to coincide with elections rather than genuine sentiment.On the incident, Sindhudurg guardian minister Ravindra Chavan, who holds the PWD portfolio, said, ""A case has been filed against the proprietor of the firm M/s Artistry, Jaydeep Apte, and structural consultant Chetan Patil (both involved in statue work) in Sindhudurg."" Chavan said, ""The steel used in making of the statue had started rusting.

BJP slams West Bengal CM

NEW DELHI: Union minister of women and child development Annapurna Devi on Friday responded to West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee 's second letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying that information contained in her letter is ""factually incorrect"" and suggested that it aims to ""cover up delays"" in the operationalization of Fast Track Special Courts (FTSCs) in the state.The letter came after Mamata Banerjee wrote to the Prime Minister for the second time, expressing frustration over the lack of a direct response to her initial plea for stricter central legislation on rape cases. In her letter Banerjee criticised the Union Minister’s earlier reply as inadequate and generic.""As may be seen, the information contained in your letter in this regard is factually incorrect and appears to be a step in the direction to cover up the delays in operationalizing the FTSCs by the State,"" the Union minister said in her letter.Annapurna Devi also slammed the West Bengal government for not operationalizing 11 additional FTSCs despite the pendency of 48,600 rape and POCSO cases in the state.""In the FTCs in West Bengal, a total of 81,141 cases were pending as on 30.06.2024,"" the letter read.""Inspite of pendency of 48,600 rape and POCSO cases in West Bengal, the State has not operationalized additional 11 FTSCs which may be exclusive POCSO Courts or combined FTSCs dealing with both Rape and POCSO cases, as per the State's requirement,"" the letter added.In her letter, she said that stringent laws already exist under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), which prescribes severe punishments, including life imprisonment and the death penalty, for such crimes.Mamata Banerjee's second letter to Prime Minister Modi, dated August 29, 2024, was a follow-up to her initial letter sent on August 22, 2024. In her initial letter, Banerjee had expressed deep concern over the rising incidents of rape and called for more stringent central legislation to address these crimes. She stressed the need for exemplary punishment for perpetrators to act as a deterrent and urged the Prime Minister to take immediate action.In her second letter, Mamata Banerjee expressed disappointment over the lack of a direct response from the Prime Minister to her first letter, which she deemed critical in light of the ongoing situation in West Bengal. She acknowledged receiving a reply from the Union Minister of Women and Child Development, Annapurna Devi, but criticized the response for not adequately addressing the gravity of the issue. Banerjee emphasized that the seriousness of the subject and its relevance to society had not been fully appreciated in the minister's reply.""You may kindly recall my letter No.44-CM dated August 22, 2024, regarding the need for stringent Central legislation on incidents of rape and meting out exemplary punishment to perpetrators of such crimes. No reply was received from your end on such a sensitive issue,"" Mamata Banerjee wrote in her letter to PM Modi.The BJP strongly criticized Mamata Banerjee's approach, with party leaders accusing her of attempting to mislead the public. BJP leader Amit Malviya took to social media, calling Mamata Banerjee a ""liar"" and accusing her government of failing to implement the stringent rules already in place for the protection of women and children. The BJP also urged the West Bengal government to act with honesty and integrity in handling such sensitive issues.On August 9, the brutal rape and murder of a trainee doctor at Kolkata's RG Kar hospital led to a political storm in West Bengal. The incident sparked widespread outrage, with protests erupting across the state. The tragedy has fueled accusations of negligence against Mamata Banerjee's government, further intensifying the already tense relationship between the state and the Centre.","Union minister of women and child development Annapurna Devi responded to Mamata Banerjee's second letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
