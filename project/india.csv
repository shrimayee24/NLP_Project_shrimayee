“Democracy Sliding Into ICU”: Opposition Targets BJP As BMC Polls Trigger Political Storm







MUMBAI: Deputy CM Eknath Shinde praised MNS chief Raj Thackeray , five of whose corporators have backed Shinde Sena in KDMC, saying Raj has never looked at personal gain and has always taken decisions from a broader perspective.Shinde said, “MNS has supported Shiv Sena for development in Kalyan-Dombivli. Earlier too, MNS was with us (Mahayuti) in LS and assembly elections. The alliance of BJP and Shiv Sena is not just for now. Now MNS has also participated in it. We are seeing who benefited and who lost from the (UBT Sena-MNS) alliance, Raj has never looked at personal gain.""He has always taken decisions from a broader perspective. He had supported PM Modi on development. He had also supported us in the assembly elections. Raj Thackeray values feelings of his workers,” Shinde added further.Shinde said there was no tussle between Sena and BJP over the mayor’s post in BMC and added the mayor will be from Mahayuti. In a dig at Sena (UBT), he said those who don’t have numbers must not dream of getting their mayor elected. Observers said Shinde seems to have conceded BMC mayor’s post to BJP as he has been talking of a Mahayuti mayor.Referring to Kalyan-Dombivli, Shinde said Sena and BJP won’t stay away from each other in power there.","Shinde said there was no tussle between Sena and BJP over the mayor’s post in BMC and added the mayor will be from Mahayuti.
