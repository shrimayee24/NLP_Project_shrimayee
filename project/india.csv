In a historic political shift, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is poised to form government in Delhi after 27 years, securing a commanding two-thirds majority in the assembly elections 2025. The BJP's resounding victory ends over a decade of governance by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), led by Arvind Kejriwal The last BJP government in Delhi served from 1993 to 1998, marking this win as a significant comeback for the party.Of the 70 assembly constituencies, the BJP clinched 48 seats, while AAP managed to secure only 22. This landslide victory saw several prominent AAP leaders, including Kejriwal, former deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia , former minister Satyendra Jain , and Saurabh Bharadwaj, losing their constituencies.In a closely watched contest, Kejriwal lost the New Delhi assembly seat to BJP's Parvesh Verma by a margin of 4,089 votes. Meanwhile, Congress' score remained zero as the party failed to secure any seat.Here's are the winners and losers in the Delhi assembly elections 2025Yet again, he was BJP’s mascot, chief campaigner and the man who had to compensate for the local party unit’s lack of a formidable ﬁgure. That he led BJP to a big victory proves he remains a big vote-getter and a great motivator for party cadre. He adroitly wooed both lower-income groups and middle classes. His high-decibel campaign speeches against AAP’s ‘corruption’ framed BJP’s charge against AAP chief. The Delhi victory, coming on top of BJP’s Haryana and Maharashtra wins, has pretty much restored Brand Modi, which had taken a few knocks after Lok Sabha elections.So, that’s one more job off his 'to-do' list. Delhi had eluded Modi’s BJP since 2014 and Shah had strategised hard both in 2015 and 2020. He did it again this time, framing a broad strategy as well as ﬁxing the nuts and bolts. Getting the party cadre to believe that Kejriwal was beatable was not easy. But, helped by Modi’s aggressive dubbing of Aam Aadmi Party as ""AAP-da"" (disaster), he managed to turn the mood around. His decision to ﬁeld Pravesh Verma against Kejriwal was a master stroke typical of BJP’s no.2.Humble, accessible, ﬁercely honest, a new kind of politician who promises a new kind of politics. That was his image in 2013, when he burst onto the political scene. Now? Hubristic, yet another leader who allegedly uses govt for political funding, a politician who's lost touch with those who made him a success, seemingly uncaring that the city he governed became a byword for urban mismanagement. Kejriwal's rise to power and prominence was as spectacular as his fall from grace. That he — humiliatingly — couldn't even RETAIN the seat he's won three times since 2013 makes it even worse.His star rose with Kejriwal's. But he had an early intimation of trouble in the last assembly polls. He had just scraped through in Patparganj in 2020 and shifted to Jangpura this time. That made him look like he was running away. The defeat in Jangpura has dealt him a severe political blow. Like it's for Kejriwal, his successes — supposedly the brain behind AAP's transformation of govt schools in Delhi — are now a distant memory. Not a mass politician on his own, what happens to his political career depends entirely on whether Kejriwal can recover from this defeat.Daughter of academics and plucked out of obscurity by Kejriwal, she became a media star for AAP, followed by her appointment as an advisor to the then-deputy CM Sisodia. She was the SAFE choice for Kejriwal when he had to GIVE UP CMship after being sent to jail. No one took her seriously in that job, including many in AAP. She was CM for 135 days and could do nothing to change the perception of non-governance by AAP. Her win, after a big scare during counting, is of little consolation to either her or her party.For the Gandhis, nothing's worked since Congress turned in an impressive show in Lok Sabha elections. Delhi is the third election loss since LS, and 2025 is the third time Congress has scored a duck in the city. Brother and sister campaigned in the capital but made little difference to overall results. But, funnily, all’s not bad for the Gandhis. That Congress may have cost AAP votes and that AAP was beaten roundly is, ﬁrst, revenge for Congress and, second, a buffer against other regional satraps’ critiques. Had AAP won, TMC, SP would have come down hard on Gandhis and their party.","BJP secured a commanding two-thirds majority in the assembly elections 2025.

Usually in such cases, the winning party asks one of its MLAs to vacate a relatively ‘safer’ seat for the chief minister, and then bypolls are held.Originating from an influential political family in Delhi, Parvesh Verma is the son of former BJP leader and Delhi chief minister Sahib Singh Verma. His uncle, Azad Singh, previously held the position of North Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor and contested from Mundka constituency as a BJP candidate in the 2013 assembly elections.His political journey began in 2013 when he emerged victorious in the Delhi Legislative Assembly elections from the Mehrauli constituency.Subsequently, he clinched the West Delhi parliamentary seat in 2014 and secured a remarkable re-election in 2019, winning by a substantial margin of 5.78 lakh votes.Ahead of the 2025 Delhi elections, Parvesh Verma launched a campaign titled ""Remove Kejriwal, Save the Nation"", highlighting the alleged failures of the current AAP government in delivering their core promises.During his campaign, Verma sharply criticised the Delhi government's administrative capabilities, particularly their approach towards pollution management, women's safety, and urban infrastructure development. He emphasised their unfulfilled promise regarding the cleaning of the Yamuna River, which continues to pose a significant environmental issue for Delhi.","BJP's Parvesh Verma is locked in a very tight battle against AAP’s Arvind Kejriwal in the New Delhi assembly constituency.

Offence is best defence: Politics of confrontation

NEW DELHI: Arvind Kejriwal 's dream run in Delhi has come to an end. After two sweeping victories - in 2015 and 2020 - Kejriwal's AAP has been swept out of power in the 2025 assembly elections. The BJP has finally managed to breach Kejriwal's Delhi fortress to regain power after a gap of 27 years. The former Delhi chief minister, who was out on bail in the excise policy case, ran a very aggressive campaign against the BJP and also targeted the Congress.So, why did Kejriwal lose? Here's a look at some of the tricks that failed to click for the AAP chief.Arvind Kejriwal, who was out on bail in the excise policy case, resigned as chief minister of Delhi in September 2024, months ahead of elections to take a high moral ground on the issue of corruption.""I am ready for Agni Pariksha. Two days later, I will resign as chief minister. I will not sit on that chair till the people announce their verdict,"" Kejriwal had said at the time of resignation.Kejriwal, who had refused to resign even when he was in jail, eventually gave up his chair amid turmoil faced by him in the Delhi excise policy case. Several top leaders, including Kejriwal himself, faced accusations of accepting bribes from liquor companies in exchange for favorable policies. Eventually, several AAP leaders were jailed in connection with the case.Kejriwal's claim to fame in his first two terms was his transparent and pro-people governance model. The AAP chief claimed credit for transforming Delhi's government schools and his Mohalla clinics provided cheap medicare to the poor. In the 2020 elections, Kejriwal sought votes for his work and AAP campaign centred around the change it had brought to the lives of the people. However, this time around AAP's campaign was centred around its attacks on the BJP leadership and the Congress. Kejriwal, who along with top AAP leadership faced several corruption charges, focused less on development and governance narratives. He called BJP ""Gali Galauj Party.""In the middle of the campaign, Kejriwal dropped a bombshell as he accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna waters to kill people of Delhi. Kejriwal's charges gave a toxic turn to Delhi campaign with both BJP and Congress going all out against the AAP chief. At the end, as the results show - the people of Delhi were not swayed by his ""concerns"" for them.Arvind Kejriwal tried to woo the middle class by unveiling his party’s manifesto for them. He claimed that the middle class were ignored by successive governments and accused other political parties of treating them as ""just an ATM for the government"". Ironically though, Kejriwal's manifesto did not mention what he would do for the middle class if voted to power but only listed seven demands from the Centre to improve their lives. Little wonder, at the end the Centre's sops for the middle class in the Uunion Budget appealed more to Delhi voters than the AAP's demands.Confrontation has been a part of Kejriwal's politics right from the beginning. This time around it was no different. Right through his campaign, Kejriwal trained his guns at Delhi Police and the Election Commission. Kejriwal accused the Election Commission and Delhi Police of colluding with the BJP to subvert the electoral process and prevent AAP from campaigning. Kejriwal targeted Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar and alleged that he ""wants a job post-retirement"" and was ""destroying the country"" for the post. Kejriwal's decision to take on the Congress along with the BJP boomeranged as on several seats, AAP's margin of defeat is less than the votes polled by the Congress candidate. Both Kejriwal and Rahul made relentless attacks against each other giving an opportunity to mock the allies-turned-rivals and take digs at opposition unity.",Arvind Kejriwal's dream run in Delhi has come to an end.

NEW DELHI: Pumped up by the BJP's historic win in the Delhi assembly elections, West Bengal BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari on Saturday shot off a salvo at CM Mamata Banerjee , saying after the national capital Bengal would vote for the BJP by the uproot ruling TMC.""Delhi ki jeet hamari hai...2026 mein Bengal ki baari hai...(Delhi's victory is ours...in 2026 it will be Bengal's turn),"" Adhikari said while reacting to BJP's massive comeback after 27 years of political exile.The BJP leader claimed that his party won easily in most of the Bengali majority areas of Delhi.""'AAP-da ki vidaai ho gayi hai'...

Now the People of Delhi will receive the benefits of Double Engine Govt in the National Capital as Mr Farziwal has been swept out of power,"" Adhikari posted on X.The Bengal BJP unit also hailed the party's good performance in the Delhi polls, terming it a rejection of corruption and nepotism, while the TMC, which had backed the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), maintained silence on the outcome.State BJP chief and Union minister Sukanta Majumdar said the verdict in Delhi reflected people's faith in development and would serve as a morale booster for party workers in West Bengal ahead of next year's assembly elections.The BJP is poised to form a government in Delhi after more than 26 years, with the latest Election Commission trends showing the saffron party ahead in 45 of the 70 assembly seats and AAP in 21 seats.""The people of Bengal will also vote for the BJP in the next assembly polls and reject the TMC,"" Majumdar told news agency.The 2021 West Bengal assembly election resulted in a decisive victory for the All India Trinamool Congress (TMC), led by chief minister Mamata Banerjee, securing 213 out of 294 seats.

First Congress lost allies, then votes



Had the outcome been different if INDIA bloc contested together?



NEW DELHI: In the bustling newsrooms, as vote counting began for the Delhi elections, two names dominated the airwaves: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). Conspicuously absent from the conversation was the Congress party – once the dominant force in Delhi's political landscape. As the day went by, the only thing that remained constant was the grand old party's score on the scoreboard - zero.The Congress party, which ruled Delhi for 15 years on the trot from 1998 to 2013, went through a fourth consecutive defeat, ""humbly"" accepting the mandate as it had no other choice.""We humbly accept the mandate of Delhi. Heartfelt thanks to all Congress workers for their dedication and to all voters for their support. The fight for Delhi’s progress and the rights of Delhiites—against pollution, inflation, and corruption—will continue,"" the party leader Rahul Gandhi said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his victory speech said that the Congress ""drowns and takes down its allies with it"".Political analysts have often wondered if it's the Congress that's the weak link in INDIA bloc or is it the only pan India uniting force.When outcomes are analysed, INDIA bloc has lost crucial battles since it came into existence- Lok Sabha elections and Maharashtra. However, on the other side, it did secure victory in the politically crucial poll battle of Jammu and Kashmir- but the Congress could only manage six seats, leaving the National Conference as the largest party.Likewise, the opposition bloc swept the Jharkhand polls with Jharkhand Mukti Morcha leading the way with 34 seats. Congress could win only 16.What's noticeable here is that the INDIA bloc has always won where the regional parties have taken the steering wheel.States where the opposition bloc did not contest together- Haryana & Delhi- did end up becoming each other's vote cutters, paving a smooth way for the BJP.The story of Congress's downfall in this election began well before the first vote was cast. The fractures within the INDIA bloc, a coalition of opposition parties, became apparent when heavyweight leaders like Mamata Banerjee and Akhilesh Yadav chose to back AAP's Arvind Kejriwal instead of their supposed ally, Congress.""It feels like the BJP government will be formed,"" admitted Congress candidate Sandeep Dikshit from the New Delhi constituency, his words reflecting the party's diminishing expectations. The exit polls had already predicted this outcome, with most projections pointing to a clear BJP victory.Rahul Gandhi during the poll campaigns led a fierce attack on AAP, targeting Kejriwal over corruption allegations, while Kejriwal hit back, raising the National Herald case against Rahul.Jammu and Kashmir CM Omar Abdullah criticized INDIA bloc allies AAP and Congress for contesting as rivals in the Delhi elections, as trends indicated significant gains for the BJP.""Aur lado aapas mein (fight more), "" Omar said reacting to trends.The results raised an inevitable question: Could the outcome have been different if the INDIA bloc had maintained unity? Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut seemed to think so, suggesting that a combined opposition could have secured victory against the BJP within the first hour of counting.""The early trends show a sharp competition. Had Congress and AAP been together, the results may have been different. The political opponent of AAP and Congress is BJP. Both of them fought to keep BJP from coming to power, but they fought individually. If they had been together then BJP's defeat must have been confirmed in the first hour (of counting),"" Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut said.The division of opposition votes, a phenomenon also witnessed in the Haryana assembly elections, appeared to play directly into the BJP's hands. The very alliance that was formed to unite the opposition against the BJP ended up exemplifying its disunity.As Delhi's political landscape continues to evolve, the Congress party struggles to stay relevant. The party that once commanded the capital's political narrative now finds itself searching for relevance in a city it once called its own.","The Congress party, which ruled Delhi for 15 years on the trot from 1998 to 2013, went through a fourth consecutive defeat.

NEW DELHI: Exit polls have frequently missed the mark in recent elections. In the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, they overestimated the Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) performance, while in the Haryana assembly election, they incorrectly projected a tilt towards Congress. Predictions also varied widely across states. However, in the Delhi assembly election, exit polls were notably accurate, closely aligning with the actual results.On the counting day, the BJP secured 48 seats, while the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) won 22 seats displaying its worst performance since 2013.While most exit polls correctly predicted a BJP victory, their estimates for AAP varied significantly.Exit polls broadly captured BJP's lead, though many overestimated AAP's tally, reflecting the inconsistencies that have plagued past election predictions.Based on the Delhi election results (BJP: 48, AAP: 22, Congress: 0), P-Marq emerged as the most accurate, predicting AAP at 26 and BJP at 44, with a deviation of just four seats for both parties. Poll Diary followed closely, precisely forecasting AAP’s 22 seats and coming within two seats for BJP, though it slightly overestimated Congress.Axis My India also performed well, underestimating AAP by just two seats and missing BJP’s tally by the same margin, making it one of the more reliable projections for the BJP.Chanakya Strategies and People’s Insight had a six-seat deviation for BJP and a five-seat deviation for AAP, making them relatively accurate but not the best. Similarly, JVC Poll showed a comparable margin of error.Further down the accuracy rankings, MATRIZE significantly overestimated AAP’s strength (35 seats, 13 more than actual) while underestimating BJP’s performance (38 seats, 10 fewer than actual). DV Research followed a similar pattern, overestimating AAP by eight seats and underestimating BJP by the same number.The Poll of Polls compilation had a four-seat error for AAP and a five-seat error for BJP, placing it in the middle of the accuracy rankings. Peoples Pulse-Codema was significantly off, underestimating AAP by seven seats and overestimating BJP by eight seats. However, WEPRESIDE was the least accurate of all, overestimating AAP by a massive 27 seats while underestimating BJP by the same margin, making it the most incorrect prediction overall.Also read: Delhi election results: How the OGs of AAP became Kejriwal’s biggest critics over the decade AAP leaders dismissed the projections before the results were announced, citing historical inaccuracies.

AAP's heavyweights swept off

NEW DELHI: In a stunning political shift for Delhi, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) marked a historic comeback in 27 years, securing 48 out of 70 assembly seats. The ruling Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ), which had governed the capital for two consecutive terms, suffered a massive setback, managing to secure just 22 seats.What made the defeat more striking was the loss of several top AAP leaders, including former chief minister and party's national convenor Arvind Kejriwal Despite AAP’s overall poor performance, a number of relatively low-profile candidates played a crucial role in keeping the party's presence known in the Vidhan Sabha as barely any key names were able to get a win.AAP’s Atishi secured a hard-fought victory in Kalkaji, successfully defending her seat against BJP’s Ramesh Bidhuri and Congress’s Alka Lamba with a margin of 3,521 votes. She was among the few high-profile leaders in the party to retain their constituencies. Alongside her, three former Delhi government ministers—Gopal Rai (Babarpur), Mukesh Ahlawat (Sultanpur Majra), and Imran Hussain (Ballimaran)—also clinched wins. Imran Hussain registered a decisive victory in Ballimaran with a margin of 29,823 votes, while Gopal Rai secured Babarpur by 18,994 votes. Additionally, Amanatullah Khan emerged victorious in Okhla, defeating his opponents by 23,639 votes.Thus, the lesser known names became a saving grace for the party, raising a possibility of modifications in AAP's top command. Here is a list of the underdogs that won:Here’s the list without bold and bullets:Several key AAP leaders faced setbacks in the elections, including some of the party’s most prominent figures. Delhi's ex-CM Kejriwal suffered a surprising defeat in New Delhi, losing to BJP’s Parvesh Sahib Singh Verma by 4,089 votes. Former deputy CM Manish Sisodia also fell short in Jangpura, where he lost to BJP’s Tarvinder Singh Marwah by a narrow margin of 675 votes.Senior leader Saurabh Bharadwaj was defeated in Greater Kailash to BJP’s Shikha Roy by 3,188 votes. Meanwhile, ex-minister Satyendar Jain faced one of the biggest losses for AAP, losing Shakur Basti to BJP’s Karnail Singh by a significant 21,000 votes.As the Delhi elections swept away key leaders, a significant challenge now arises in determining who will emerge as the primary opposition, with the BJP's lotus blooming in the capital.With Atishi's victory, she becomes a leading contender to spearhead the opposition, but her path could be complicated. Without the backing of major figures like her predecessor Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, and Satyendra Jain, Atishi must navigate a party with MLAs, who until now, have lacked a strong presence in top command. This leadership gap might pose a challenge as AAP works on diminished presence and the possible risk of workers jumping ship.Additionally, the 'underdogs' have the task of keeping the party's momentum going, and to work in hopes to regain the lost glory AAP had for two terms.Thus, while BJP’s sweeping victory dominated the election results, the winning AAP candidates proved that grassroots leaders and lesser-known names could still command the trust of voters over key leaders' assurances. As Delhi’s political landscape undergoes a drastic shift, these victories are AAP's silver lining in an otherwise dismal electoral performance.","The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) marked a historic comeback in 27 years, securing 48 out of 70 assembly seats.

"Ctrl+Alt+Delhi: Arvind Kejriwal loses own seat 1st time, city reboots after 10 years",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ctrlaltdelhi-arvind-kejriwal-loses-own-seat-1st-time-city-reboots-after-10-years/articleshow/118079287.cms,"Lotus bloom vs pehle AAP: It was a matter of 2% points

Delhi's is among the smallest of many elections held in the world's largest democracy - but on Saturday, the national capital sent out some massive national political messages.First, BJP's post-Lok Sabha elections loss of lustre is now a firmly closed chapter. Modi is back again as a political super-force and the most saleable political brand.Second, following from the first, Rahul Gandhi is back to looking like he used to before Congress won 99 seats in Lok Sabha polls.Nothing he does or says seems to matter when it comes to elections.Third, Arvind Kejriwal's status as a big national opposition player has, for now at least, been severely diminished. Seldom has a political brand taken as big a hit as his took after the Delhi results.Fourth, the opposition alliance is now in tatters.Fifth, at least in urban areas, freebies alone can't win elections, as became clear via Delhi voters punishing AAP for bad infrastructure.In Delhi, there was a sense of one era ending and another beginning in the city. BJP returned to office after 27 years, and AAP was voted out after a decade. Kejriwal will not return as Delhi CM, nor will Atishi. All eyes are on who Modi-Shah pick as BJP's CM.The last time BJP was voted to office in Delhi, in 1993, Yamuna still had aquatic life, Appu Ghar was the biggest city attraction, Delhi Metro looked like a distant dream, and city air wasn't toxic. A city that has changed so radically, for good and bad, gave a verdict that was equally dramatic.The sense of stunning change was heightened by Kejriwal losing the New Delhi seat. His 4,089-vote loss to Parvesh Verma, ex-BJP CM Sahib Singh Verma's son, in a seat he'd won by 21,000-plus votes in 2020, capped an awful day for AAP's brass.How Delhi apportioned its votes was an interesting story by itself. BJP’s 48-seat haul in the 70-seat assembly came on the back of a 45.6% vote share. AAP’s 22-seat tally, less than half of BJP’s, was coupled with a substantial 43.6% vote share.That a 2-percentage point difference in vote share could change fortunes so comprehensively said five things.First, this is the first time ever that a party with a 40%-plus vote share in Delhi has lost elections. Second, the 10-percentage point fall in AAP’s vote share between 2020 and 2025 didn’t erode its low-income voter base substantially.Therefore, third, middle class Delhi voters swung against the party and made a pivotal difference to the results.Fourth, middle class anger against AAP was centred around the party’s seemingly uncaring attitude towards city infrastructure, an anger AAP either missed or downplayed.Fifth, at the margins, that AAP and Congress fought separately and waged a bitter campaign against each other, made some crucial difference to the overall outcome.Breaking up the verdict by Delhi sub-regions shows just how far-reaching BJP’s victory is. Its wins largely came from the outer Delhi areas bordering Haryana in north and west, and from New Delhi and East Delhi. BJP won nine of 10 seats in the West Delhi parliamentary constituency area, eight each in North West Delhi and East Delhi, and seven in New Delhi. In the 2020 polls, BJP had failed to win a single seat in West Delhi and New Delhi, while it had emerged victorious in one seat in North West Delhi. It also won six seats in Chandni Chowk Lok Sabha area, where it had no legislators in the last term.Plus, BJP also managed to make inroads in Dalit-dominated areas, winning four of the 12 reserved SC constituencies. Capping all this was the party wresting the Muslim-dominated seat of Mustafabad, where it benefitted from a four-cornered fight.","BJP returned to office after 27 years, and AAP was voted out after a decade.

She stressed on AAP's commitment to opposing BJP's ""dictatorial"" policies.AAP MLA and Okhla assembly constituency winner Amanatullah Khan, however, alleged that the Election Commission and govt apparatus was prejudiced against his party. ""The entire system was engaged in making BJP win,"" he said. The Election Commission was partial in its conduct, he alleged.BJP, in its official reaction, said that the Prime Minister's guarantee had delivered the win. Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva said: ""The people of Delhi have expressed their faith in PM Modi 's guarantee. AAP should introspect as govts don't work on corruption and lies.""BJP winner Shikha Roy, who beat AAP's Saurabh Bharadwaj in Greater Kailash, credited her success to the party leadership and its hard-working campaigners.

BJP reclaimed Milkipur from SP in a political grudge match, while DMK proved too strong for its opponent in Erode (East) - actor-politician Seeman's NTK, a Tamil nationalist organisation.BJP candidate Chandra Bhanu Paswan defeated SP's Ajit Prasad by 61,710 votes in the bypolls held on Feb 5, necessitated after his father Awadhesh Prasad vacated the seat upon his election to LS from Faizabad in Ayodhya district in 2024.The victory served as BJP's response to its shock defeat in Faizabad within a few months of PM Modi inaugurating the Ram temple in Ayodhya. In 2022 UP elections, BJP had won four of the five seats within Faizabad LS constituency, of which Milkipur is an assembly segment.In Erode (East), DMK's VC Chandhirakumar won with a margin of 91,374 votes, securing 74% of the vote share and providing a happy tonic to CM MK Stalin's party before next year's assembly elections. AIADMK, BJP, and allies stayed away from the bypolls.NTK's MK Seethalakshmi polled 24,151 votes (15.5%), while NOTA came third with 6,101 votes - among the highest in a TN assembly election.

This was crucial as it targeted one of the largest voter demographics of Delhi, setting the tone for BJP's welfare-centric narrative.On Jan 25, he released BJP's 'Sankalp Patra (manifesto)', which was followed by two public meetings in Rajouri Garden and Tri Nagar, where he emphasised the party's promises and lashed out at AAP's governance model. The manifesto was seen as a ""masterstroke"" by many as it aimed at reinstating trust in BJP's commitment to Delhi's development.","Home minister Amit Shah hailed the Delhi result as the beginning of a ""new era of development"" in the national Capital. He said Delhi would become an ideal capital under PM Narendra Modi's leadership.

However, the total number of women elected dropped from eight in 2020 to five this year. This time, the five women who emerged victorious include four from BJP and one from AAP. The three main parties - BJP, AAP, and Congress - fielded 25 women candidates.Overall, out of 699 total candidates, 95 were women this time, marking the highest female participation in decades.However, this only accounts for 13.6% of the overall candidates. Historically, the highest number of women MLAs in Delhi was recorded in 1998, with nine women elected when Congress, led by Sheila Dikshit, first assumed office after Delhi became a Union Territory with its own legislature in 1993. The first assembly had just three women MLAs. The number fluctuated in subsequent years: seven in 2003, three in 2008 and 2013, and six in 2015.This time, the victorious women from the BJP include Shikha Roy, who defeated AAP's Saurabh Bharadwaj by 3,188 votes in the GK constituency; Neelam Pahalwan, who triumphed over AAP's Tarun Kumar by 29,009 votes in Najafgarh; Rekha Gupta, who won against AAP's Bandana Kumari by 29,595 votes; and Poonam Sharma, who defeated AAP's Rajesh Gupta by 11,425 votes. From AAP, Atishi managed to retain her seat, defeating BJP's Ramesh Bidhuri by 3,521 votes.Roy, a two-time councillor, caused an upset by defeating Bharadwaj in the GK constituency, while Pahalwan, a former councillor, unseated Tarun Kumar, the sitting MLA in Najafgarh. At Shalimar Bagh, it was a face-off between two women. In the 2020 polls, Gupta came in second place to Kumari, but this time, she reclaimed the seat for BJP. Kumari is a three-time MLA from the seat.In the last election, AAP's Rajesh Gupta won by 11,690 votes, while BJP's Mahender Nagpal finished second with 45,641 votes. He was defeated this time by Sharma. For AAP, Atishi managed to hold onto her Kalkaji assembly seat, narrowly defeating BJP's Ramesh Bidhuri by over 900 votes in a tightly-contested race. Her victory provided a rare moment of success for the party on an otherwise disappointing day, as party chief Arvind Kejriwal and other prominent members were defeated by BJP in their respective seats.In 2020, the women elected to the assembly included Atishi from Kalkaji, Rakhi Birla from Mangolpuri, Preeti Tomar from Tri Nagar, and Dhanwati Chandela from Rajouri Garden. Back then, AAP fielded nine women candidates, eight of whom secured seats, while none of the six women candidates fielded by BJP were successful.During the campaign, political parties focused heavily on addressing the women voters, pledging a range of women-focused initiatives in their respective manifestos.","BJP, AAP, and Congress fielded 25 women candidates for Delhi assembly elections.

""After we requested a meeting on Friday, he responded positively.He assured us that he would take up the matter seriously to ensure that justice is served,"" the victim's father told TOI.The meeting came a day after the parents moved SC for continuation of CBI investigation into the crime, and a day before the victim's birthday on Feb 9, when the family has appealed to people to hit the streets demanding justice.The meeting prompted Trinamool to hurl multiple posers at the family.

Leading the charge was former CM and Union minister Manohar Lal Khattar, the party's chief strategist for Delhi.The BJP in Haryana virtually turned the election into a ""Haryana versus Delhi"" battle.The election became a direct face-off between Delhi and Haryana, fuelled by dramatic theatrics by AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal and Saini. In response to Kejriwal's accusation that Haryana was sending polluted water to Delhi, Saini staged a spectacle by taking a sip of Yamuna water to prove its purity. This stunt triggered political drama, with BJP collecting water samples from the Yamuna, followed by senior AAP leaders staging protests in Delhi, using the same water as a symbol of their resistance. Haryana BJP leaders were also roped in to manage several constituencies for party nominees in Delhi, based on their ""recent successful"" mission in Haryana, where the party surprised everyone by forming the government for the third time in October last year.Even most statements issued by the Haryana CM and his ministers were dominated by the assembly elections, mostly targeting Kejriwal for being ""unfaithful"" to his home state. Kejriwal is a native of Siwani area in Haryana's Bhiwani district.Two cases were also filed in Haryana against Kejriwal. In one case, Kejriwal was summoned by a Sonipat court on January 29 after the disaster management authority in Haryana filed a complaint over his statements on Yamuna water from Haryana. Then an FIR was registered against him in Ambala on February 1 on the same issue. It was perhaps the first time that a senior leader of a party was booked in another state over statements made during a poll campaign.The result was not only a booster for Saini, who for the first time was seen being vocal, but also for Khattar, who was running the affairs in the contest. He roped in all BJP MPs, who held press conferences to target Kejriwal for his Yamuna water campaign against Haryana. Prior to Delhi polls, Haryana was involved in political affairs of another state when in February 2024 some Congress rebel MLAs were sheltered in Panchkula in a bid to topple the Sukhwinder Singh Sukhu-led Congress govt in Himachal Pradesh. That attempt failed.","The BJP in Haryana virtually turned the election into a ""Haryana versus Delhi"" battle.

Since BJP has won 48 seats, it can send two members to RS. On the other hand, AAP can bag one RS seat as the party has won 22 seats in the assembly.Earlier, all three RS seats from Delhi went to BJP (in 1994) when the party won the assembly polls in 1993. Subsequently, the three seats went to Congress thrice (in 2000, 2006 and 2012) after the party won assembly elections consecutively in 1998, 2003 and 2008. Similarly, all three seats went to AAP twice (in 2018 and 2024) as the party won the assembly polls in 2015 and 2020.However unlike AAP, which could send all three of its members to the Rajya Sabha on its own, BJP and Congress had to depend on independents and one or the other smaller parties to send their third member to the Upper House.",The results will ensure the capital sends members of two different political parties to the Rajya Sabha.

Delhi Election Results 2025: Delhi's voters have given the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) a historic mandate in the Delhi assembly polls 2025. Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has suffered a big defeat, with the former Delhi CM and AAP convenor losing his seat to BJP's Parvesh Verma! BJP has won 48 seats and AAP 22 in the 70 constituency Delhi assembly election.The NDA coalition, led by BJP, celebrated their Delhi triumph as a validation of PM Modi's stewardship. The Congress, on the other hand, maintained that the results reflected public opinion on AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal rather than the Prime Minister's initiatives.Congress strongly defended its decision to contest against AAP, criticising those who questioned their stance. They pointed out that similar concerns about opposition unity were not raised when AAP contested elections in Goa, Gujarat, Haryana and other states, potentially dividing the secular vote.Which seats in Delhi election saw the top 5 highest victory margins, and which saw the top 5 lowest victory margins? Three out of five of the highest victory margins are of AAP candidates. Interestingly, all five of the lowest victory margins belong to BJP candidates, including Tarvinder Singh Marwah who defeated AAP leader Manish Sisodia.

"After Delhi debacle, should INDIA bloc take inspiration from PM Modi's 'ek hain to safe hai?'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-delhi-debacle-should-india-bloc-take-inspiration-from-pm-modis-ek-hain-to-safe-hai/articleshow/118068463.cms,"'Ek hain to safe hai?'



NEW DELHI: Sometimes when things fall apart they may actually fall into place. Calls for re-negotiations within the INDIA bloc were heard after Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) made a comeback in Delhi after 27 years due to the ugly slugfest between INDIA bloc allies - Congress and AAP.After BJP swept 48 out of 70 assembly seats, INDIA bloc partners like National Conference and Shiv Sena (UBT) reminded the only two national parties how only a united front could stop the saffron party's victory campaign.Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut said the outcome of the recently concluded elections could have been different if Congress and AAP had the same political opponent - BJP.""The early trends show a sharp competition. Had Congress and AAP been together, the results may have been different... The political opponent of AAP and Congress is BJP. Both of them fought to keep BJP from coming to power, but they fought individually. If they had been together then BJP's defeat must have been confirmed in the first hour (of counting),"" Raut said.Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah also indicated a loss for both AAP and Congress, sharing a meme, which purportedly said, ""Jee bhar kar lado. Samaapt kardo ek dusre ko!""Congress J&K unit also reiterated Omar's stance and said that the results were a lesson for all who believe that they can fight against the BJP-RSS combine alone.""The verdict of Delhi is against the AAP, which was in power for 10 years, and its failure to deliver on promises, but also due to its over-ambition and overconfidence to defeat the BJP on its own by going solo in these elections.""The politics of opportunism, deceit and over-ambition of the AAP led to its defeat and the victory of the BJP,"" Jammu and Kashmir Pradesh Congress Committee (JKPCC) chief spokesperson Ravinder Sharma said in a statement.During the run-up to the elections, both AAP and Congress turned hostile towards each other after no consensus was achieved to contest the polls together.Congress and Arvind Kejriwal's AAP engaged in an open war of words, accusing and targeting each other - much to the discomfort of other alliance partners.Rahul Gandhi led the charge against AAP and made relentless attacks on Arvind Kejriwal targeting over corruption allegations. Kejriwal also returned fire and attacked Rahul over the National Herald case.The fight between the two key allies also divided the other INDIA bloc partners. Samajwadi Party came out openly in support of AAP as Akhilesh Yadav campaigned for Kejriwal. Mamata Banerjee and Sharad Pawar also backed Kejriwal but did not campaign on ground. However, Uddhav Thackery's Shiv Sena (UBT) stayed neutral.The opposition alliance was initially conceived with the goal of promoting regional parties in their respective states, giving them a stronger voice in local governance.However, after the Lok Sabha elections, each state assembly election pointed out the internal contradictions within the alliance, as the grand-old-party often found itself in direct competition with one another at the state level.The opposition alliance may have to find motivations from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's rhetoric 'Ek hai toh safe hai' which he used during the Maharashtra assembly polls to Dalits, tribals, and Other Backward Classes (OBCs) to stay united.The CPM and Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) expressed profound dissatisfaction, stating that internal discord within the INDIA bloc contributed to the saffron party's electoral success in Delhi.The Marxist party launched a scathing critique of the Congress, holding them responsible for enabling the BJP's triumph in Delhi.While refraining from direct criticism of the Congress, the IUML emphasised that a unified electoral approach by INDIA bloc partners could have effectively prevented the saffron party's ascent to power.TP Ramakrishnan, senior CPM leader and ruling LDF convener, contended that the Congress failed to provide adequate backing for the INDIA block's effective operation.""There was no support from the side of the Congress. If the party had taken the initiative, the alliance could have functioned more effectively. But the grand old party did not fulfil its responsibility,"" he stated.He further criticised the Congress for not adopting a constructive position in maintaining the INDIA bloc's unity and cohesion.Commenting on the BJP's success in the Delhi elections, seasoned IUML leader P K Kunhalikutty suggested that the outcome could have been averted with INDIA bloc unity.Kunhalikutty maintained that a different result would have emerged had all alliance members remained united.As INDIA bloc loses one more election to BJP, maybe it's time to regroup and fight with a united front?","Congress and Arvind Kejriwal's AAP engaged in an open war of words, accusing and targeting each other.

BJP gears up to form government as leaders celebrate victory in Delhi elections

The 2025 Delhi Assembly elections have delivered a dramatic shift in the political landscape of the national capital. As vote counting enters its final phase, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has emerged as the frontrunner, securing six seats and leading in 42 constituencies. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which has dominated Delhi politics for over a decade, has also won six seats but trails in only 16 constituencies.To form a government in the 70-member Delhi Assembly, a party must secure at least 36 seats, a milestone the BJP is poised to achieve. This election has seen significant political upsets, with prominent leaders among the candidates who lost in Delhi elections, marking a shift in voter sentiment and paving the way for new faces to rise to prominence.Former Delhi Chief Minister and AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal faced a stunning defeat in the New Delhi constituency, a seat considered a stronghold for his party over the past decade. BJP’s Parvesh Sahib Singh Verma won by a margin of 4,089 votes, securing 30,088 votes compared to Kejriwal’s 25,999. Congress’ Sandeep Dikshit trailed with 4,568 votes. The voter turnout in New Delhi stood at 56.41 per cent, reflecting a competitive battle in the constituency.Former Deputy Chief Minister and senior AAP leader Manish Sisodia lost the Jangpura constituency to BJP’s Tarvinder Singh Marwah by approximately 600 votes. Sisodia secured 38,184 votes, while Marwah garnered 38,859 votes. Sisodia acknowledged the defeat, stating, ""We fought the elections well. I would like to thank the people who supported us."" This loss marks a significant shift in voter sentiment, as Jangpura had been an AAP stronghold since 2015.AAP’s Saurabh Bharadwaj lost the Greater Kailash seat to BJP’s Shikha Roy by a margin of 3,188 votes. Roy secured 49,594 votes, while Bharadwaj finished with 46,406 votes. Congress’ Garvit Singhvi secured third place with 6,711 votes. This result reflects BJP’s growing influence in a constituency where AAP previously held a strong presence.Former Delhi minister and AAP leader Satyendra Jain was defeated by BJP’s Karnail Singh in the Shakur Basti constituency by nearly 21,000 votes. Singh secured 56,869 votes, while Jain received 35,871 votes. This marks a significant decline from Jain’s previous victories in 2015 and 2020, where he won with comfortable margins.BJP’s Ramesh Bidhuri lost the Kalkaji seat to Delhi Chief Minister Atishi by over 3,500 votes. Bidhuri secured 48,633 votes, while Atishi won with 52,154 votes. Bidhuri’s defeat marks a notable shift in Kalkaji, where he had previously shown strong performance in national elections.Congress candidate Alka Lamba secured less than 5,000 votes in the Kalkaji constituency, trailing significantly behind Atishi and Bidhuri. Lamba’s poor performance highlights Congress’s diminishing influence in Delhi politics.BJP’s Parvesh Sahib Singh Verma defeated AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal in the New Delhi constituency with a margin of 4,089 votes. Verma’s victory is particularly significant given Kejriwal’s decade-long hold on the seat. Verma attributed his win to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership and vision for Delhi.Delhi Chief Minister Atishi successfully retained her Kalkaji seat, defeating BJP’s Ramesh Bidhuri by over 3,500 votes. Despite AAP’s overall struggles in Delhi, Atishi’s victory represents a rare bright spot for the party, although her winning margin decreased compared to 2020.BJP’s Kailash Gahlot secured a comfortable lead in the Bijwasan constituency, defeating AAP’s Surender Bhardwaj by 9,833 votes. Gahlot, who resigned from AAP and joined BJP in November 2024, has demonstrated significant political strength in this election.BJP’s Tarvinder Singh Marwah defeated AAP’s Manish Sisodia in a closely contested battle in Jangpura. Marwah’s victory by approximately 600 votes marks a major upset in a constituency previously dominated by AAP.With the BJP set to form the next government, party leaders gathered at the BJP headquarters in New Delhi to celebrate. As per reports, Delhi BJP President Virendra Sachdeva stated, ""The result will be in favour of the double engine government,"" referring to the party's strategy of aligning both central and state governance under BJP leadership. Sachdeva also indicated that the next Chief Minister would be from the BJP, but the final decision would be made by the party’s central leadership.BJP MP Yogender Chandolia took to social media to thank Delhi voters, stating, ""I thank the people of Delhi for listening to PM Modi’s appeal. Kejriwal has collapsed in all models. It is confirmed that Kejriwal will go to Tihar. He wanted to be the CM, but he is not even going to be an MLA anymore. Any party worker chosen by the party high command will be the next CM of Delhi.""","The 2025 Delhi Assembly elections have delivered a dramatic shift in the political landscape of the national capital.
