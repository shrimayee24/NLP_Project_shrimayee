"For Kanshi Ram’s ‘Pagla’, polls are all about music",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/for-kanshi-rams-pagla-polls-are-all-about-music/articleshow/110317348.cms,"Singing was what Kishore Kumar picked up naturally, listening to the women folk in his village in Mau. It was this talent of his that made BSP founder Kanshi Ram give him the nickname of ‘ Pagla ’.Thereafter he came to be known as Kishore Kumar Pagla by party workers and leaders. “Behenji knows me and calls me for party events,” says the 70-year-old who is busy these days with BSP campaigns and public rallies of senior leaders where he sings folk songs .“Kanshi Ram ji kahte the, arre pagle, tune mujhe apna diwana bana diya. He loved my andaaz (Kanshi Ram Ji used to say that I had impressed him with my songs and style of singing),” the BSP cadre in Ambedkarnagar said.In one of the election rallies of Akash Anand, held in April in Ambedkarnagar, he was present on the stage, singing. “A few years ago, I met him at a party event in Patna, where I sang in front of him. People wonder how I sing so effortlessly even at this age. But it’s my passion to sing, and sing for my party,” said Pagla, who counts himself among the committed cadre of BSP. He has no training to boast of.“I picked it up from the womenfolk of my village, who used to sing on every occasion. In the weddings, they sang gaalis (cuss words) and sohar on dholak. I used to sing with them,” says ‘Pagla’ who was born in a Dalit family in a nondescript village in Mau. “We had some land. Before I joined BSP, I did odd jobs to take care of my family,” he says.In 1984, when a few people from the Bahujan movement reached his village to encourage Dalits to join DS-4 (Dalit Shoshit Samaj Sangharsh Samiti), he became a part of the social movement that Kanshi Ram had launched. “I had studied a little. The movement told us about great thinkers, from every religion. I got moved by it all and joined the party,” he added.Other than doing the works he was given at the party, he also took to entertaining people with his songs and that’s how he got noticed by Kanshi Ram.“On one of the Behenji’s birthdays, Kanshi Ram Ji had called me to Delhi and there he told her, ‘tum isko apne karyakram mein le jaao, istemaal karo, tum bhashan dena, yeh gaana gayega’ (take him to your programmes, he will sing while you address people).”Asked if his commitment to the party has paid off, he said, “Yes. I was made a member of a music institute in UP when Behenji became the CM.”‘Pagla’ does not write songs. He composes tunes on a harmonium. And that’s where the role of party cadre, like Ghulam Kiwiriya, comes in. Based in Ambedkarnagar, Kiwiriya has lost count of the number of songs he has written till now.“It must be around 800 songs. In 2005, Behenji had called me to Delhi and that’s when my songs were recorded in a studio,” says Kiwiriya, a weaver who has been with the party since its founding days. “Many songs written by me have not only been sung by big singers but also other singers in the party.” The songs reflect the ideology of the party and are inspired by the Bahujan movement.Kiwiriya can sing himself too. He is also called to sing at party events and campaigns. “I only request those who call me to pay the fare, at least.” “In villages, where pamphlets do not communicate much, it is the song that works out the connection with voters,” he says.Kiwiriya could be heard singing at the rallies that the party is organising in every state for the Lok Sabha elections.","‘Pagla’ picked it up from the womenfolk of his village, who used to sing on every occasion.

Raja vs ‘mantri’ face-off to affect Pratapgarh poll?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/raja-vs-mantri-face-off-to-affect-pratapgarh-poll/articleshow/110317304.cms,"It’s the battle of prestige between two regional parties on the twin turfs of Pratapgarh and Kaushambi .On one side is Anupriya Patel ’s Apna Dal (Sonelal) faction and on the other is Jansatta Dal (Loktantrik) led by Raghuraj Pratap Singh aka Raja Bhaiya. Given the high stakes, focus is on the electoral shift in the 10 assembly segments of the two constituencies between 2017 and 2022 UP assembly elections.In a veiled attack on Raja Bhaiya at a rally in Kunda assembly segment of Kaushambi reserved seat last week, Anupriya had slammed the “self-proclaimed kings who thought Kunda was their fiefdom”.“Ab raja EVM se paida hote hain (Now kings are born from EVMs),” she had said. The statement was seen as Patel’s aggressive posturing to consolidate Dalit and OBC votes in the region. The Kunda strongman hit back saying that “EVMs give birth to Jan sewaks (public representatives) and not Kings”. “Raja Rajwade to saat dashak pehle hi khatam ho gaye,” he had said while criticising Patel’s statement. He also claimed that there was “anti-incumbency” against the sitting BJP MP Vinod Sonkar who is seeking a second term from Kaushambi.Her attack came after Raja Bhaiya, who had been getting closer to the BJP since 2017, took a “neutral” stance and asked his supporters to “vote as per their wish” in the Lok Sabha elections. Raja Bhaiya, the scion of Bhadri estate in Pratapgarh, has been a seven-time MLA from Kunda since 1993 and wields clout in Kunda and its adjoining areas.Anupriya Patel is an ally of BJP and a minister in the Modi govt. She is in the fray from Mirzapur Lok Sabha seat which is located close to Kaushambi. While Jansatta Dal (Loktantrik) is not contesting the Lok Sabha elections, the buzz is that the party might campaign against Patel in Mirzapur.Kaushambi went to the polls on May 20 while Pratapgarh will vote on May 25.Samajwadi Party had wrested five out of 10 assembly seats in Kaushambi and Pratapgarh from the BJP in the 2022 UP elections. Three of these five seats — Sirathu, Manjhanpur and Chail – were in Kaushambi. In fact, Sirathu was won by Anupriya’s elder sister and Apna Dal (Kamerawadi) member Pallavi Patel who had contested on an SP ticket.Pallavi, however, ended her association with the SP in March this year and even left the INDIA bloc to form PDM Nyay Morcha — Pichda (backwards), Dalits and Muslims — with AIMIM chief Asaduddiin Owaisi. Likewise, SP MLA from Chail (Kaushambi), Pooja Pal, too drifted towards the BJP this year and even cross voted for BJP’s Rajya sabha candidates. She also thanked CM Yogi Adityanath for addressing the pain of her community. Pal is the widow of BSP legislator Raju Pal who was shot dead by gangsters Atiq Ahmed and his brother Ashraf in Prayagraj in 2005.In Pratapgarh, SP had wrested Patti and Raniganj assembly seats from BJP in the 2022 UP elections. Of the other three seats, BJP and Apna Dal (S) had won Pratapgarh and Vishwanathganj, respectively, while Rampur Khas was retained by Congress’s Aradhana Mishra.BJP MP from Pratapgarh, Sangam Lal Gupta, was elected from Pratapgarh assembly seat in 2017 on AD ticket. He had then defeated SP’s Nagendra Singh with an impressive margin of over 34,000 votes.In 2019, Gupta had won from Pratapgarh Lok Sabha seat on BJP ticket while defeating SP-backed BSP candidate Ashok Tripathi by around 1.18 lakh votes. Gupta is back in the fray and facing SP Singh Patel of SP and Prathamesh Mishra of BSP.","Anupriya Patel is an ally of BJP and a minister in the Modi govt.

"PM Modi: I don't have any successor, people of this country are my successors",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-i-dont-have-any-successor-people-of-this-country-are-my-successors/articleshow/110303593.cms,"NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said the people of the country were his successors as he did not have any other successor.""Modi is a person who does not have any personal ""virasat"" (legacy). For me, you are my legacy, you are my successors. I don't have any other successor. So, I have to work very hard to ensure a bright future for you and your children.I don't want that your next generation should face the problems that you have experienced in your lifetime,"" the Prime Minister said at an election rally in Bihar.The Prime Minister's assertion comes days after Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal cited the ""75 years age rule in BJP"" and claimed that Amit Shah would be Modi's successor when Prime Minister turns 75 next year. Kejriwal's claims were strongly rebutted by all top BJP leaders including Amit Shah and party chief JP Nadda.Attacking the BJP, Kejriwal had said: ""These people ask INDIA bloc about their (PM) face. I ask BJP who will be their PM? Modi ji is turning 75 on September 17 next year. He had made the rule that people aged 75 will be retired. They retired LK Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, Sumitra Mahajan.""""He (Modi) will retire next year. He is seeking votes for making Amit Shah the prime minister. Will Shah fulfill Modiji's guarantee?"" the Delhi chief minister had asked.Union home minister and senior BJP leader Amit Shah strongly rejected Kejriwal's claims and said ""I would like to tell Arvind Kejriwal and company and the whole Indi alliance, Modi becomes 75, there is no need for you to feel happy. It is not written anywhere in BJP's constitution. Modi will complete the term and will continue to lead the country. There is no confusion in BJP on this.""However, this is not the first time that the Prime Minister has identified himself with the people of the country. In several of his speeches, PM Modi has referred to people as his family. In March, responding to RJD supremo Lalu Prasad's jibe that he had ""no family"", the Prime Miniser had said “140 crore people of India are my family”. Later, the BJP leaders launched a campaign and declared themselves as ""Modi ka parivar"" on their social media profiles.In fact, a key thrust area of PM Modi's Lok Sabha campaign has been to highlight the dynasty politics of the opposition. He has been unscathing in his attack on family-based parties blaming them for the ills facing the country. In his election speeches, he has often attacked opposition leaders like Rahul Gandhi, Akhilesh Yadav and Tejashwi Yadav and said they were ""born with silver spoons"".Interestingly, to counter his charge of ""parivarvaad"" (politics of dynasty)against the opposition parties, PM Modi in his 90-minute Independence Day speech last year used the term ""parivarjan"" (members of family) nearly 68 times. In his speeches thereafter, he used the word ""parivarjan"" to address people several times.","The Prime Minister's assertion comes days after Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal cited the ""75 years age rule in BJP"" Kejriwal claimed that Amit Shah would be Modi's successor when Prime Minister turns 75 next year.

He assured the people of Odisha that once a BJP govt is formed in the state, the inquiry report will be made public.""Those who lack compassion for Odisha's heritage, cannot protect it,"" he said.Earlier on Monday, Modi visited the temple to offer prayers and also inquired about the matter from servitors.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Monday wrote to the Union home ministry, stating that the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) allegedly received foreign funds exceeding Rs 7 crore in violation of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA).The ED discovered this information during a money laundering investigation related to drugs, involving former Punjab AAP MLA Sukhpal Singh Khaira and others, said several media reports.The ED initiated the probe in 2021 and arrested Khaira, who has since joined the Congress.In August last year, the agency sent a detailed communication to the Union home ministry, highlighting the alleged violations by AAP and categorising them as contraventions of the FCRA and The Representation of the People Act.Recently, the ED shared additional information with the Ministry of Home Affairs ( MHA ).Media reports said the ED found that the AAP had received approximately Rs 7.08 crore in overseas donations to date. The agency alleged that the party ""mis-declared and manipulated"" the identities and nationalities of the foreign donors, as well as other details.The ED provided the MHA with verified information about the donors, including their nationalities, passport numbers, donation amounts, mode of donation, bank account numbers, billing details, and payment gateway used.The agency also reported that some fundraising events organised by the AAP's overseas wing volunteers in the USA and Canada between 2015 and 2016 were allegedly conducted in violation of the FCRA.In one specific instance, the ED claimed that the names and nationalities of some Canada-based individuals had been ""concealed"" in the party's financial records to ""hide"" the foreign donations being made to the party's Indian bank account.A senior official stated that cases of FCRA violations are investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), and the home ministry can request the CBI to look into the charges made by the ED.AAP leader Atishi hit back at ED's allegations, and said that this was yet another ploy by the BJP.""After the liquor scam and t he Swati Maliwal case failed to bring down AAP, the BJP has concocted this case ... this clearly shows the BJP is losing the 20 seats of Delhi and Punjab. This is not the ED's action ... but the BJP,"" said Atishi.The AAP leader said the ED's charges over foreign funding stem from a case that is 11 years old. ""This is a conspiracy by Modi to defame AAP,"" Atishi added.""I want to tell BJP and ED that since its formation, Aam Aadmi Party has given account of every single rupee to the Election Commission and the Income Tax Department,"" she said.","The Enforcement Directorate (ED) wrote to the Union home ministry, stating that the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) allegedly received foreign funds exceeding Rs 7 crore in violation of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) The ED discovered this information during a money laundering investigation related to drugs, involving former Punjab AAP MLA Sukhpal Singh Khaira.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110277435,imgsize-36548,width-400,resizemode-4/110277435.jpg"

Past Perfect, Present Tense

PRAYAGRAJ (ALLAHABAD): In the winter of 1984, Allahabad was struck by Amitabh . Paradropped into national politics, the reigning Hindi cinema superstar had returned to his land of birth to challenge the seemingly unbeatable Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna in the Lok Sabha polls. And the erudite city, on the last legs of its old lustre, was swept away.Vivek Ranjan was only a teenager then, but vividly recollects how feverish young men and women would flock to the special open van, a rarity then, that the actor used for campaigning.“People would line up on roads, wave from balconies,” recalls Ranjan, who runs an NGO. He was also told about an incident when the convoys of the two contestants crossed each other. “Bachchan got down from his van, touched Bahuguna’s feet and asked for his blessings,” he remembers being told.The election’s outcome surprised many. Adulation had converted into ballots. Bachchan triumphed by 1.87 lakh votes. It was the last time Congress won the seat. Interestingly, BJP ’s Ritu Bahuguna Joshi, who won in 2019, is Hemwati’s daughter.Now, 40 years later, Congress is hoping to retrieve a city that has not only changed political hands and name — it is called Prayagraj now — but also wandered off the map of national relevance.The city of three rivers was once the garbhagriha of the national movement, a bustling epicentre of knowledge that nourished the likes of Motilal Nehru, Madan Mohan Malaviya, Akbar Allahabadi, Meghnad Saha, Harivansh Rai Bachchan, Firaq Gorakhpuri, Sumitra Nandan Pant, and many others. It was, after all, a verdict in the Allahabad high court against Indira Gandhi in 1975 that changed the direction of India.The city’s centrality, says Sahitya Akademi recipient Neelum Saran Gour, was also tied to the primacy of the Nehru-Gandhi family in Indian politics that’s no longer there. “Even in the time of V P Singh, the city’s politics had a robustness. That season has faded away,” she says.Allahabad has served as the constituency of Prime Ministers Lal Bahadur Shastri and V P Singh, and prominent politicians like Bahuguna and Murli Manohar Joshi. But the constituency, says social scientist Badri Narayan, didn’t enjoy the kind of infrastructural growth it should have had. “Lucknow, being the centre of state power, and Varanasi, being the PM’s constituency now, have benefited. In comparison, Prayagraj only has Kumbh as a form of symbolic power to leverage,” he says.Much has changed nonetheless. Gour says the city’s infrastructure, orderliness and amenities have improved in recent years. “But one misses Allahabad’s cosmopolitan and open climate when one didn’t have to speak with caution and communities interacted freely and with trust,” she says.Politics too is in the hands of a new generation. It’s the day of the progeny. Congress candidate Ujjwal Raman Singh, a Bhumihar by caste, is the son of Rewati Raman Singh, a two-time MP from the same constituency, and a Samajwadi Party veteran. Ujjwal served as environment minister when SP governed Uttar Pradesh. The 51-year-old postgraduate in law switched parties last month. SP and Congress have joined hands for the polls.His BJP rival, Neeraj Tripathi, a Brahmin, is the son of Kesari Nath Tripathi, who, among other things, served as Uttar Pradesh speaker and Bengal governor. Ramesh Kumar Patel, a 47-year-old agriculturist, is BSP’s candidate.Of the five state assembly segments, a mix of rural and urban, BJP and its allies hold four; SP the fifth. Brahmins, Dalits and Patels (OBC) are numerically weighty, followed by Banias and Muslims. In a city where Ganga and Yamuna converge, the Nishads (boating community), based primarily in villages close to the rivers, are significant. Nishad Party, led by Sanjay Nishad, is in alliance with BJP-led NDA.The general tone of voters is one of dissatisfaction, irrespective of voting preference. But there’s no overt indication that the social blocs have moved. Geographically, BJP is strong in the urban areas, and SP relatively in villages. “Gaon hamara, shaher tumhara,” jokes an SP supporter, who will vote for Congress.Pintoo Nishad of Arail village owns 10 boats. “Too many boats, too little income,” he says, “The educated among us have nothing to do but take photos of tourists at Sangam.” He is worried whether his two daughters — one studying engineering, the other agricultural science — will find jobs. But when it comes to votes, he says, “Sanjay Nishad jahan bhi honge, hamara vote wohin hoga (We vote for whichever party our leader supports).”Guru Prasad Prajapati of kumhar (OBC) caste from Kabra village, says, “Women in my household like Modi.” Doodhnath Pathak of Lawayanpur village runs a small eatery. “Poori duniya Modiji ki ijjat karti hai (The world respects Modi). He has done good work, built roads,” he says. But he is personally indebted to Rewati Raman Singh who, he reveals, has helped him on several occasions. “I will vote for his son. But most in my community don’t think like me,” he says.Corporator Mukund Tiwary, a Congressman, estimates there are about 4 lakh Brahmin voters. “If we get a substantial chunk of them, we have a chance,” he says. Narayan of GB Pant Social Science Institute says the upper-caste votes are going to BJP in the city. “But in rural areas, it will be fractured. The OBC votes too will be divided,” he says.Allahabad is defined by divides: past and present, river and class. In 2002, noted Hindi litterateur Gyan Ranjan wrote in the periodical Tadbhav, “Allahabad…cannot go back to what it was, nor can it strike out a new path.”That may be true, but as Gour says, there is also a sincere attempt to reclaim, virtually and physically, what the city has lost. A Facebook page, Allahabad Civil Lines Nostalgic Memories, started in 2014 and with over 7,000 members, is filled with memories of the city’s mentally exiled. “And there is a profusion of writing about the city. Heritage societies have been set up, literary meets convened, even guava festivals are being organised,” she says.Reclaiming its politics, and becoming nationally relevant again, though, could be a bridge too far.","The city of three rivers was once the garbhagriha of the national movement. It nourished the likes of Motilal Nehru, Madan Mohan Malaviya and Akbar Allahabadi. Allahabad has served as the constituency of Prime Ministers Lal Bahadur Shastri and V P Singh.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110316680,imgsize-1326422,width-400,resizemode-4/110316680.jpg"

Anti-incumbency after two terms is inevitable. It’s not possible to fulfil expectations of all and disappointment is a natural corollary. Why do you still feel so confident?

But there must be some apprehension about the winnability of candidates who have already completed two terms… there might be anti-incumbency against them.

There was resentment among workers, especially in west UP, against some candidates.

Then why is Hindu-Muslim debate dominating the election discourse?

Your party is talking about inheritance tax and X-ray of properties that Rahul Gandhi mentioned in his speeches.

Amit Shah

Kejriwal is also saying that Yogi Adityanath will be replaced as Uttar Pradesh CM if BJP returns to office.

But such claims got credence after Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Manohar Lal Khattar were replaced as CMs in MP and Haryana respectively?

There was said to be a party rule that those above 75 years would not contest polls. The decision was taken when you were party president.

You have spoken several times that India will reclaim

POK

.

There is a statement by you that India will kill its enemies even if they are hiding in some other country.

Your party is claiming major gains in south India. You had several rallies there. Do you think BJP will do better in these states?

There is a perception in Odisha that BJD and BJP are engaged in shadow boxing and Naveen Patnaik will let BJP improve its share of Lok Sabha seats and you, in turn, will not obstruct a fresh term for him.

From 2014 to 2019, you were home minister and then defence minister. What role do you see for yourself in the future?

You said one issue in this election is that India’s pride and respect has increased in foreign countries. How have you reached this conclusion?

BJP is raising the Swati Maliwal issue in a big way.

Some people say RSS is not actively involved in polls this time.

This is the first election after construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya. It was believed that there would be excitement among people. However, the dip in voting indicates otherwise.

Is there a concern regarding the polling percentage?

Will your victory margin in Lucknow increase?

Your govt has taken a pledge (Viksit Bharat sankalp) to make India a developed country by 2047. For the past 10 years, the foundation for the same is being laid. How good is progress?

BJP’s slogan is ‘400 paar’ for NDA, whereas opposition parties claim it won’t be able to cross even 200 seats.The gap between the two claims is yawning. Who should be trusted?■ Our target is our pledge (sankalp)… The four rounds of polls have already given a majority to BJP and we are well on course to winning more than 400 seats for the alliance. Our target is based on the groundswell of support and the feedback of people. We have done a realistic assessment of our prospects, and the target is realistic.■ There is no doubt that fulfilling 100% expectations and aspirations of one and all is a challenging task. However, there should not be a question mark on the credibility of party members. Everybody has seen that the BJP brass has fulfilled whatever it has promised. Yo u can look at our party manifesto since 1950… whenever we got a majority we acted on our promises and delivered.■ See, I don’t deny that it is possible to some extent. But it gets trumped by the bigger issues in play: the way the country’s stature has risen globally, the way social welfare schemes have impacted each household and empowered them, I am sure people will repose faith in BJP. People sometimes express unhappiness about a particular individual but their trust in the leadership of Narendra Modi is unflinching and they say ‘aayega to Modi hi’.■ Every party goes for assessment through some agency or other means. Most decisions are taken based on the observations following assessment. I will not say that whatever decisions thus taken are 100% right. The probability of error is there in everything.■ We never do Hindu-Muslim politics. We believe in the mantra of ‘Vasudhaiv Kutumbakam’ — the whole world is a family — given by our sages since ancient times. So there is no question of discrimination on caste and community lines. Has there been any discrimination in delivery of social welfare schemes? I want you to quote PM Modi on this issue and I can give you a number of examples when the PM himself has clarified.But top BJP functionaries, including the PM, are saying that properties will be taken over by Congress and given to Muslims.■ We never say that it will be given solely to Muslims. But what kind of ideas are being fancied by the opposition? They should learn from the examples of other countries, like Brazil, Venezuela, etc. They turned bankrupt only due to such ideologies. I am surprised that such views still have takers. What do you do with such a mindset? Why will an investor come? Why will one earn if it will ultimately be taken away by the likes of Sam Pitroda?■ First of all, their claim has a message that they have already accepted their defeat and admitted that Modi will be PM once again. However, who is he (Kejriwal) to take a decision for BJP? Such a decision can be taken only by the political party concerned… in our case, it is parliamentary board that takes such decisions. The board has already announced that Modi will be PM. In fact, Modi will be PM also in 2029 . India will be a developed nation under his stewardship. People of the country want him to continue as the PM.■ Why? He (Adityanath) has done splendid work as chief minister. Law and order situation is in its best phase. The state has witnessed unprecedented development. Kaise hata diya jaayega? But let me tell you one thing, such talk by opposition parties also reflects that they have nothing to speak against the Modi govt, its performance as they are more focused on talking about BJP and making wild statements. It shows Congress and the opposition bloc is distressed and desperate.■ (Interrupts). Shivraj Singh Chouhan had an impeccable record as CM. He was CM for 18-19 years. He is a senior member of our party. There are plenty of responsibilities in the party... Centre is also there.■ (Interrupts). It was never decided. You can write in bold letters that no such decision was taken… I was party president, and I am saying it forcefully that there was no such decision at all. Had it been decided, it would have been mentioned in the party constitution. Moreover, had there been such a decision, our senior member L K Advani ji would not have contested the 2014 Lok Sabha polls.There were several others above 75 years who contested and won Lok Sabha polls in 2014 and 2019.■ I have been speaking about this for many years, it’s our commitment. I anticipate that people of POK will take a call and assert that they want to part ways with Pakistan and merge with India. Yo u must have seen people of POK removing the Pakistani flag.■ Let me repeat what exactly I said. India has never attacked any country or captured its land. Hum kisi ko aankh dikhate nahi, par koi dikhata hai to usko muhtod jawab dene ki taqat hai (We don’t go around threatening, but are capable of hitting back if someone tries to mess with us).■ We are confident of a better performance. Even in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, our party is expected to win a few seats. Our vote share will increase significantly even in Tamil Nadu. However, our party is certainly winning big in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.■ It is not at all true. Politics is serious business. BJP is an ideologydriven party and it does not resort to such games.■ This is for the party to decide. It is not necessary one continues to have responsibility throughout his life. Till the time I can work, I will discharge my responsibilities honestly and with ideological commitment. There is no discrimination at all. I believe our ideology does not allow discrimination based on caste, creed and religion.■ I had cited the example of an event that was held a few days ago in which the US ambassador was speaking. He said if you want to feel the future, come to India; if you want to see the future, come to India and if you want to work in the future, come to India. Several state heads have already said that 21st century belongs to India. There is no confusion that PM Narendra Modi has done exemplary work. Even the opponents would not deny this if asked privately. He has made the country’s economy stronger.■ It is very sad and unfortunate. I did say a day ago that it is unfortunate that such misbehaviour with a woman Rajya Sabha member has taken place at the CM’s residence. I do not have to say anything about Akhilesh Yadav, but as a well-wisher, my suggestion is that he should not have shared the dais with Arvind Kejriwal.■ (Laughs). There is no basis to it. It’s a wrong narrative. Shows the desperation of our opponents.■ Results have not come yet... (smiles). Secondly, BJP has never treated Ram temple as an election issue. It’s an issue of belief, faith and cultural heritage. We never saw this with the lens of politics. There should be development along with conservation of cultural legacy and heritage.■ It’s hot these days. Secondly, INDI Alliance has not been effective. There is no enthusiasm in its voters.What is your prediction for Amethi and Rae Bareli?■ BJP.■ It will cross 5 lakh if turnout improves.■ The foundation is very strong. It is for this reason the country has emerged as the fastest growing economy. The big size of the economy as well as the pace at which it is growing proves that the country will achieve the goal of becoming a developed nation by 2047.","Despite a lower back injury, defence minister Rajnath Singh is keeping a gruelling schedule.

The highest ever was 64.8% in 1967, while the second highest turnout was 61.75% recorded in the 1984 elections held after PM Indira Gandhi's assassination.The split in two regional parties and a bitterly contested campaign has led to even Mumbai, a city otherwise notorious for its voter apathy, clocking its second highest turnout in three decades. Mumbai has managed a respectable 54.1%, the final data shows. The turnout was just 1.3% lower than the 2019 polls even though these elections were timed almost a month later and held during the school summer vacations, in sweltering heat.As always, the elite Mumbai South constituency, home to India's richest industrialists, recorded the lowest turnout at 50%. Mumbai North, considered a BJP stronghold, had the highest turnout of 57%. Union Minister Piyush Goyal contested from here.
