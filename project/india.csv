He added, ""Those who refused to acknowledge the struggles of Vinesh and her friends, and even raised questions about their intentions and abilities, have now received their answer.""He continued, ""Today, the entire system of power that made her shed tears of blood lies shattered before the brave daughter of India,"" emphasizing that champions prove their worth on the field.Phogat’s triumph has sparked reactions from the opposition, who criticized the government for ignoring her demands during her protests in January 2023.Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh questioned whether the Prime Minister would congratulate Phogat and apologize for the mistreatment she endured at the hands of the Delhi Police during the women wrestlers' protest.Ramesh said, “Vinesh Phogat is assured of a silver or a gold medal at Paris. Will the non-biological PM call her? To congratulate her of course but more importantly to apologise for the atrocious manner in which the Delhi Police misbehaved with her during the women wrestlers protest?”Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also joined the celebration, eagerly anticipating Phogat’s medal and expressing unwavering support. ""She reached the finals by winning three important matches in a single day. My sister, we are all eagerly waiting for the medal. Your every move on the field thrills us all. The prayers of crores of Indians are with you. Jai Hind! Keep fighting! Keep moving forward!"" she said.Phogat, along with wrestlers Bajrang Punia and Sakshi Malik, had protested for the removal and arrest of WFI chief Brij Bhushan Singh over allegations of sexual harassment.Phogat's remarkable performance in the women’s 50kg freestyle wrestling event has assured her of at least a silver medal, marking India’s best result at the Paris Olympics . Her path to glory was fraught with challenges, including standing up against the wrestling federation chief, enduring harsh conditions during a 40-day protest in New Delhi, confronting police adversity, and undergoing knee surgery.","Congress leaders lauded Vinesh Phogat ’s historic achievement at the Olympics.

"Priyanka attended Ambani wedding, says BJP MP; Cong rubbishes it as ‘fake narrative’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/priyanka-attended-ambani-wedding-says-bjp-mp-cong-rubbishes-it-as-fake-narrative/articleshow/112328174.cms,"NEW DELHI: Even as Congress rubbished claims made by Nishikant Dubey that Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attended the Ambani wedding , the BJP MP from Godda stuck to his statement and said the Congress neta did attend a dinner hosted by the Ambani family at their residence in Mumbai.“I have made the statement on record on the floor of the House.The wedding celebrations took place for more than six months and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attended the dinner hosted by the Ambani family at Antilia , their residence in Mumbai. Vadra attended the dinner with her children,” the BJP MP told TOI as he stuck to his statement made in Parliament.Participating in a debate on the Finance Bill in LS, Dubey claimed a member of the Gandhi family attended the recent wedding of industrialist Mukesh Ambani ’s son Anant Ambani, an event that saw the presence of several politicians, including a number of opposition leaders.“Do you want to donate money and go to his wedding? After that keep abusing him because he is not going to defend. Which politician of this country did not go to Ambani’s wedding? Priyanka Gandhi, who is the general secretary of her party, did not go to the wedding,” he added.After Dubey’s statement, opposition MPs created a ruckus in LS. Seeing the uproar, Speaker asked Dubey to speak on Finance Bill.Congress, however, claimed Vadra did not attend the Ambani wedding and was not even in India at that time.While Congress functionaries took to X to rubbish Dubey’s claim, party leader K C Venugopal raised the issue in Lok Sabha. He dismissed Dubey’s claim and questioned the chair for allowing the MP to make such remarks. He was supported by NCP-SP’sSupriya Sule , who said there was nothing wrong in attending the wedding, adding that PM Modi also attended the event.“There is nothing wrong in attending a wedding but let us not create fake narratives. The problem with BJP is that it creates fake narratives and maligns families. It has maligned my family as well... Do you even think about what families go through?” she asked.Congress’ Supriya Shrinate wrote on X: “Priyanka Gandhi was not in the country during the event, your home minister must know this, he has an old & bad habit of keeping track of everyone (sic).”",Congress rubbishes claims made by Nishikant Dubey that Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attended Ambani wedding.

SC entrusts Gokarna temple admin to judges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-entrusts-gokarna-temple-admin-to-judges/articleshow/112328462.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has entrusted the administration of an ancient and unique Shiva temple in Gokarna, in Karwar district of Karnataka , to former apex court judge B N Srikrishna and the district judge, virtually resulting in the judiciary overseeing management of the temple as opposing groups had created an impasse.The Gokarna Mahabaleshwara temple, where the principal deity is an ‘atma linga’ believed to be one-of-its-kind in the world, was at the centre of inter-group rivalry which had led to SC appointing an eight-member committee headed by Justice Srikrishna and including deputy commissioner of the district, assistant commissioner of the taluka, SP of the district and four private persons nominated by Karnataka govt.Recently, Justice Srikrishna reported to SC that in the absence of veto power, other members were not allowing the committee to reach a consensus and this stymied the panel’s efforts to oversee administration of the eighth-century temple.Accepting Justice Srikrishna’s report, a bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra inducted the Karwar district judge as vice-chairperson of the committee to aid and assist the chairperson. “It will be open for the chairpersonto authorise him to take emergent decisions with the concurrence of the chairperson,” the bench said.While giving Justice Srikrishna veto power and relegating the other seven members to mere advisory positions, the bench said, “The chairperson shall have a casting vote in the affairs of the committee. All members of the committee other than the chairperson or the vice-chairperson shall perform advisory roles and shall not have a veto over decisions which are taken by the chairperson and the vice-chairperson. “In taking all appropriate decisions in the interest of the affairs of the trust and the temple, the chairperson and the vice-chairperson shall have due regard to age-old customs and traditions and will be at liberty to seek inputs from the upadivantas and any other eminent persons whom they may wish to consult.”SC also permitted Congress govt in Karnataka to replace the four private members in the committee, who were chosen by the earlier BJP govt, with new faces. “Above all, the parties must be mindful of the fact that Gokarna Mahabaleshwara temple is a temple of antiquity dating back to the eighth century and all steps for the proper conduct of worship and religious observances should be taken in accordance with traditions,” the bench said.","The Gokarna Mahabaleshwara temple, where the principal deity is an ‘atma linga’ believed to be one-of-its-kind in the world, was at the centre of inter-group rivalry.

NEW DELHI: Home minister Amit Shah on Tuesday took a dig at TMC MP Sougata Roy ’s suggestion to implement the “West Bengal Model” for addressing left-wing-extremism (LWE) in other states, saying, “No state would want to implement the West Bengal Model .”Speaking in the Lok Sabha during question hour, Roy said, “West Bengal was once affected by left-wing extremism , but due to Mamata Banerjee ’s developmental work, it has ceased in the state.”“There was left wing extremism in West Bengal, but the Mamata Banerjee govt controlled it there, worked on development and gave jobs to tribals,” Roy said and questioned, “Will the Union home minister, and state ministers follow the model of West Bengal and adopt it in Chhattisgarh and other states as well? Because, they are not able to control LWE.”He then asked Shah if he would study the West Bengal example and apply the same model to Chhattisgarh and other states struggling to control left-wing extremism.Replying to the Trinamool MP, Shah said, “If any state does well, then Prime Minister Modi’s govt has no problem in implementing its example in the whole country.But I believe that no state would want the model of West Bengal to be adopted there.”Left-wing extremist (LWE) violence was reported from 89 police stations across 38 districts of nine states in the first half of this year, as compared to 171 police stations in 2023 and 465 police stations in 2010, the home ministry told the Lok Sabha on Tuesday.In written reply to a question, junior home minister Nityanand Rai shared that while 647 Maoists were neutralised and 2017 security personnel martyred in LWE theatre in the past five-and-a-half years from Jan 1, 2019 to July 15, 2024, violent incidents were down 73% last year from the high levels of 2010.

BJP MP Satish Gautam demands 'quota' for SC/ST & OBC in AMU,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/bjp-mp-satish-gautam-demands-quota-for-sc/st-obc-in-amu/articleshow/112333007.cms,"Aligarh MP Satish Gautam

AGRA: Aligarh MP Satish Gautam has demanded ""quota"" for SC/STs and OBCs at Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) during a speech in Parliament. Gautam argued that AMU, being centrally-governed and funded like Banaras Hindu University, should implement the reservation system. He said that the absence of such a quota at AMU dates back to a Congress-era decision when the then education minister had declared it a ""minority institution"".Speaking in the Lok Sabha on Monday, Gautam said, ""AMU cannot get the minority status if it is receiving central funds. On the one hand, Congress talks about SC/ST and OBC , but its education minister has tried to harm the children of SCs, STs and OBCs. When there is reservation in BHU, it should be in AMU too."" This comes after Gautam on Aug 2 called for the development of Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital in Aligarh into an AIIMS-like institution to benefit people from Aligarh and its surrounding districts.He criticised AMU's Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College (JNMC), claiming that ""Hindu patients avoid it due to the majority of doctors there being from a particular community"". Prof Mohammad Asim Siddiqui, member in-charge PRO of AMU, said on Tuesday, ""The issue raised by the MP is currently before the Supreme Court. So, the AMU cannot comment on his speech.""Prof Veena Maheshwari, principal of JNMC and chief medical superintendent said, ""JNMC has always treated patients referred from Deen Dayal Hospital without discrimination. It provides non-discriminatory treatment to all patients. The college caters to around 4,500 patients daily from various districts. I've been here for 40 years.""","Aligarh MP Satish Gautam has demanded ""quota"" for SC/STs and OBCs at AMU.

Election Commission to meet political parties in J&K on Thursday,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/election-commission-to-meet-political-parties-in-jk-on-thursday/articleshow/112323202.cms,"SRINAGAR: The Election Commission of India will meet political parties in Jammu and Kashmir on Thursday to get feedback on conducting Assembly polls in the Union Territory . The office of the chief electoral officer, Jammu and Kashmir, on Tuesday issued letters to various political parties, inviting them for a meeting with the Election Commission (EC).The political parties have been given time slots for the meeting with the Election Commission.The EC, led by Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar, is scheduled to visit Jammu and Kashmir from August 8-10 to review preparedness for Assembly polls, weeks before the Supreme Court's September 30 deadline for holding elections in the Union Territory.Kumar will be accompanied by Election Commissioners Gyanesh Kumar and S S Sandhu.In March, Kumar -- who was then the sole member of the three-member commission to visit the Union Territory -- had assured political parties and the people of Jammu and Kashmir that the poll panel would soon hold elections in Jammu and Kashmir.At that time, the two posts of election commissioners were vacant. They were filled days before the Lok Sabha polls were announced on March 16.After a record turnout in the Lok Sabha elections in Jammu and Kashmir, Kumar had said, ""This active participation is a huge positive for Assembly elections to be held soon so that the democratic process continues to thrive in the Union Territory.""Besides meeting the political parties, the commission will also review the situation with the chief electoral officer and the central forces coordinator.The commission will also review the preparations with election officers and police superintendents of all districts, as well as the chief secretary and the director general of police.On August 10, the commission will visit Jammu for a review meeting with enforcement agencies. It will also hold a press conference in Jammu to brief the media on the review process.Whenever Assembly elections are held in Jammu and Kashmir, they will be the first since provisions of Article 370 of the Constitution were abrogated and the erstwhile state divided into two Union Territories in 2019.The electoral exercise in Jammu and Kashmir is usually spread over a month.Following a delimitation exercise, the number of Assembly seats has gone up from 83 to 90, excluding those allocated to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Last December, the Supreme Court directed the poll panel to hold Assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir by September 30.In a fresh indication that the Assembly polls in Jammu and Kashmir are imminent, the Election Commission last week asked the Union Territory administration to transfer officers posted in their home districts, an exercise it holds ahead of conducting elections.The commission has been following a consistent policy that officers directly connected with the conduct of elections in a poll-bound state or Union Territory are not posted in their home districts or places where they have served for a considerably long period.It is usual for the poll panel to issue instructions related to transfers of officers ahead of Lok Sabha and Assembly elections.In June, it decided to accept applications seeking allotment of 'common symbols' from registered unrecognised parties in the Union Territory.","The Election Commission of India will meet political parties in Jammu and Kashmir on Thursday to get feedback on conducting Assembly polls.
