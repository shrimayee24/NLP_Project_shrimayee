DHANBAD/RANCHI: Sita Soren, Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren's estranged sister-in-law, had a close shave Friday when a long-time personal assistant attempted to point a loaded pistol at her at a hotel during a dispute over campaign funds tied to Lok Sabha and state polls, both of which she'd lost as a BJP nominee.Other supporters overpowered PA Debashish Manoranjan Ghosh. Later, cops took him into custody and seized the unlicensed pistol.Both poll losses were attributed to mismanagement of campaign funds. Sources close to Sita said Ghosh was earlier removed as PA after her LS poll debacle. He was reinstated before assembly polls last Nov. Ghosh, sources said, was a long-time associate of Sita's late husband Durga Soren. After Durga's death in 2009, Sita took the poll plunge to become an MLA and since then, Ghosh has been associated with her.Sita was visiting Dhanbad for a wedding. ""After attending the event, I went to the hotel to get some rest. A discussion was taking place on possible reasons for my (poll) loss. Ghosh was managing my funds and campaigning. When we posed questions, he could not answer many. Suddenly, he put his hand in the pocket in a bid to pull out the pistol, but others caught him,"" Sita added.Sita had ended her 15-year-long association with JMM following ""family tussles"" and shifted allegiance to BJP in March last year.",Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren's estranged sister-in-law Sita Soren had a close shave Friday.

SURAT: Prime Minister Narendra Modi accused previous governments on Friday of neglecting the plight of the poor and using the ""Garibi Hatao"" slogan merely as a vote-grabbing gimmick without bringing any real change.On a two-day visit to Gujarat, Modi addressed a gathering in Surat's Limbayat area after participating in the Food Security Saturation Campaign. He began his tour by inaugurating and performing a ground-breaking ceremony for development and infrastructure projects worth Rs 2,587 crore in Silvassa town of the Union Territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli, including a 450-bed NAMO Hospital.He took a swipe at the opposition, saying those who failed to win even a single seat in recent elections ""wouldn't even know how many zeroes were are in Rs 32 lakh crore (amount disbursed as loans under PM Mudra Yojana over the past decade).""Modi said the BJP-led NDA govt has lifted over 25 crore people out of poverty through various welfare schemes launched in the last 10 years. ""Jise kisi ne nahin puchha, use Modi ne puja hai (Those ignored by all, Modi has honoured them),"" he said, drawing applause.In a veiled dig at previous Congress govts, Modi said, ""For decades, people were fed up with hollow slogans of 'Garibi Hatao'. These slogans were revived whenever elections were near, but poverty only deepened.""Speaking on food security reforms, Modi said that 10 years ago, nearly five crore bogus ration cards were in circulation, allowing a nexus of looters to siphon off food meant for the poor. ""We cleaned up this mess, deleted those fake beneficiaries, and linked the entire system with Aadhaar cards to ensure that every grain reaches the rightful beneficiary,"" he said.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi accused previous governments of neglecting the plight of the poor.
