"In violence-scarred Gohana, Congress has edge as farm stir, Agnipath & jobs top poll agenda",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-violence-scarred-gohana-congress-has-edge-as-farm-stir-agnipath-jobs-top-poll-agenda/articleshow/113581112.cms,"GOHANA: In 2005, Gohana was rocked by inter-caste violence. Around 50 Dalit homes were ransacked - some almost turned to ruins - in this small town in Haryana 's Sonipat. The ravagers were incensed after a Jat was killed following an altercation with a group of Dalits over an alleged slur made a few days before.Nearly two decades later, bitter memories of that long nightmare have receded to the background.In Valmiki Basti, the wrecked homes have been rebuilt; several doubled-storeyed now. Contractor Tilak Ram, old enough to remember, and 50-year-old peon Madan Lal, profess that the aggression of dominant castes has gone down considerably since then.But younger Dalits in the colony have other problems to talk about. Naveen Sawan, a graduate who plays local cricket and repairs bats for a living, bemoans lack of jobs. His elder brother says, ""Upar Modi theek hai. Par yahan badlao chahiye (Modi is okay at the Centre, but we need change in the state)."" The colony's vote, he proffers while others nod, is largely divided between Congress and BJP . Others in the fray - Dushyant Chautala's JJP and Abhay Singh Chautala's INLD, which is in alliance with BSP - don't figure in the discussion. Neither does AAP, contesting all 90 seats. Gohana assembly seat has 19% SC voters.Electioneering is at its peak in this bustling town, also famous among foodies for its giant jalebis. Vehicles flaunting party flags are brimful of robust men. Even independents are campaigning with gusto, notably Harsh Chikara, a young Jat social worker whose posters are prominent across the town and outside.Four-time MLA Jagbir Singh Malik of Congress won the last three polls. His vote share, though, has declined from 42% in 2009 to 33% in 2019. The 74-year-old Jat politician, a graduate in legislative law, faces BJP's Arvind Kumar Sharma, a 61-year-old dental surgeon and a four-term MP from an assortment of parties. Sharma lost badly on a BJP ticket to Congressman Deepender Singh Hooda in this year's Lok Sabha polls in Rohtak; he had defeated the same opponent narrowly five years earlier. ""He has been brought in to end the long reign of Malik,"" says Sonu Bamania, a Dalit who makes seats for automobiles.Mobile store owner Dinanath Chawla says Sharma is a good candidate for BJP, especially since the assembly seat has seen little development in the Malik years. But fellow shopkeeper Kartikay Mehta says that Sharma is being looked at as an outsider. ""BJP will muster decent votes in the town but Congress is stronger in the surrounding Jat-dominated villages. That's Malik's stronghold,"" he says. About 72% of Gohana voters are rural, according to chanakya.com.Like several other states both in north and south India, caste is embedded in Haryana society and politics. Pundits often see Haryana's politics as a binary between Jats and non-Jats. Roughly 1/4th of the state's total population, Jats are Haryana's single-largest caste and have traditionally lorded over state politics. The situation changed in 2014 when BJP swept the state polls and Manohar Lal Khattar, an RSS pracharak and a Punjabi, was made the CM. Shortly before the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, Nayab Singh Saini, an OBC, replaced him. BJP's slogan for the Oct 5 assembly polls is: ""Non-stop Vikas, Sabka Viswas (Non-stop Development, Everyone's Trust).""In Khandrai village, a mixed group of young and elderly Jats are unimpressed. The community seems to be gravitating in bulk towards Congress despite other parties led by Jat politicians in the fray. Their decision-making is spurred by the fact that the Congress campaign is spearheaded by former Haryana CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda, a Jat, and his son Deepender. Incidentally, the Gohana violence happened under Hooda's watch as CM.Local farmer leader Ashok Lathwa lists lathicharge on protesters during the farmers' agitation (2021 and 2023), the Agnipath scheme and widespread unemployment as three key subjects of grievances against BJP regime.","In 2005, Gohana was rocked by inter-caste violence.

'Dynastic influence' & NC's social engineering at play in Kashmir,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dynastic-influence-ncs-social-engineering-at-play-in-kashmir/articleshow/113581085.cms,"KANGAN (GANDERBAL): Without any questions, Mehar Ali , short, frail and unassuming, has eased into the role of his father Mian Altaf Ahmad, National Conference MLA since 1987, as the candidate from Kangan constituency in Ganderbal.Yet another dynasty? Well, this is one that even Narendra Modi, the heat-seeking missile against political families of opposition, would keep away from.For, Ahmad represents the high spiritual seat revered by the Gujjar-Bakerwal communities across J&K, and his family going back to grandfather have represented Kangan since 1962. In 2024 Lok Sabha polls, Ahmad defeated PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti in Anantnag, the vacant assembly now filled by his son.Debutant Ali rubbishes Modi's attack line of ""dynasty"", telling TOI, ""What dynasty? The 'awam (people)' has elected us. People will decide if they like dynasty or not."" Ahmad underscored the point. ""I am a third-generation dynast and my son is fourth. People vote for us. Dynasties work hard to earn support. It is about merit, that's how I understand.""He reasoned that a doctor's child becomes a doctor and a journalist's son becomes a journalist. ""We cultivate relationships over generations, and it is not easy to leave people midway. That's how it continues."" The ease of answer and manners, as also father-son's short stature, hides the clout that the family wields across the two regions sizzling in the heat of the battle royale.From the border areas of Jammu to deep inside Kashmir, the tribals hold the family in high esteem, its religious influence seamlessly blending with politics and creating poll winners.A loyal National Conference member, Ahmad Friday accompanied Omar Abdullah to Poonch and Rajouri for campaigning and was back in his village Babanagri at night - enough to explain his reach across regional faultlines. The tribal politics has become competitive with BJP's pre-poll decision to include the Pahari community in ST list with separate quota.Curiously, through the Mian family, one realises the social engineering and heartland style that National Conference has weaved to aggregate votes this year.In 2024 Lok Sabha contest, it fielded Ahmad from Anantnag-Rajouri seat to add the tribal votes to its base to defeat Mehbooba, and nominated a Shia cleric and veteran MLA Syed Aga Ruhullah Mehdi from Srinagar to present a diverse mix with appeal to the minority sect that populates Srinagar-Budgam and adjoining areas. Both won comfortably in 2024, even as party mascot Omar crashed to a shocking defeat to jailed Engineer Rashid in Baramulla.Ahmad was apparently reluctant to contest for LS in April, which sent Omar into a tizzy as he rushed to Babanagri to convince the veteran. Ali laughs off the episode. ""My father was unwell and he told a journo he will start campaigning after nomination, which got blown by media into something else."" Even if it was confusion, it only demonstrated the family's political salience.Three months later, along with its organisational reach and resources, National Conference is looking at Ahmad and Aga Syed to stay ahead of rivals in an election with imponderables galore in Independents and newbies like AIP of Engineer Rashid and Apni Party.Ahmad signed off, ""It is the people who create the dynasties, and who terminate them.""","Ahmad represents the high spiritual seat revered by the Gujjar-Bakerwal communities.

There was palpable resentment against her for allowing her ""ambition"" to get the better of loyalty and forgetting what the party had done for her. ""She had a say in selection of a dozen candidates and that was commensurate with her strength. She has to be realistic,"" a senior party functionary said.Senior functionaries told TOI that to quell the perception, a rally being planned for Rahul Gandhi in Haryana will bring together all important state functionaries including Hooda and his MP son Deepender Hooda, MPs Randeep Surjewala and Selja in a show of strength.Senior Congress functionaries claimed that the rumours around Selja were triggered by BJP camp led by former CM Manohar Lal Khattar to set a narrative against the party. On Saturday, Kharge was quoted by a TV channel as saying Selja was a senior functionary loyal to Congress and that the party did not need advice from BJP.Khattar, a Union minister, had on Saturday asked Selja, a prominent Dalit face seen to be close to the Gandhi family, to join BJP and accused Congress of ignoring her. Haryana CM Nayab Singh Saini too had attacked Congress. When Congress released its seven guarantees for Haryana at a press conference at the party headquarters on Sep 18, neither Selja nor Surjewala were present. Haryana state unit chief Udai Bhan and Hooda were present.","Kumari Selja is said to be feeling marginalised ever since the Congress leadership reposed faith in her factional rival Bhupinder Singh Hooda.

VIJAYAWADA: Deputy chief minister and Jana Sena president Pawan Kalyan proposed the formation of a ‘ Sanatana Dharma Rakshana Board ’ at the national level following controversy over the adulterated ingredients used in making Tirupati Laddu Prasadams.Pawan has raised serious concerns following reports of alleged contamination of the sacred Prasadam offered at the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) temple.The disturbing findings suggest the presence of animal fats, including fish oil, pork fat, and beef fat, in the Prasadam, sparking widespread outrage.Kalyan demanded that the TTD board, constituted under the YSR Congress Party govt, provide answers and take responsibility. He emphasised that such incidents not only hurt religious sentiments but also highlight broader issues related to temple desecration, land management, and dharmic practices.""Our govt is committed to taking the strictest action possible against this.

Not in politics for money: Kejriwal

NEW DELHI: Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday posed five questions to RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat: Do you agree with PM Modi 's ""tactics of using threats of ED and CBI to topple state govts?"" Does RSS agree with Modi inducting ""most corrupt netas"" into BJP ? Has Bhagwat ever stopped the PM from doing these ""wrong things""?The Delhi ex-CM also asked, ""What went through your heart"" when J P Nadda said BJP no longer needs RSS? Should BJP's ""rule on age of retirement"" apply to Modi (75) ""as it did to LK Advani""?While addressing a ‘Janta Ki Adalat’ at Jantar Mantar on Sunday, Kejriwal alleged that PM Modi uses ED and CBI to “topple state govts”.The AAP national convenor asked Bhagwat, “Is this right for the country? Don’t you think this is harmful to democracy?” He reminded Bhagwat that RSS members say they are “nationalists and patriots”.Kejriwal also said the politicians whom Modi and home minister Amit Shah themselves called “most corrupt” just a few days ago were included in BJP shortly after.The former chief minister further questioned that since BJP was born from the womb of the RSS, has Bhagwat ever stopped the PM from doing these “wrong things”?Kejriwal claimed BJP National President JP Nadda had said during this year’s Lok Sabha elections that BJP no longer needs RSS. “Has the 'son' grown up so much that he has started challenging his 'mother'?” he asked.Claiming of a “rule in BJP that anyone who crosses the age of 75 will retire”, Kejriwal said prominent netas like Lal Krishna Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, BC Khanduri, Kalraj Mishra, and Shanta Kumar were “retired” and wanted to know whether this rule will apply to Modi.Hoping that Bhagwat would respond to these questions, Kejriwal urged everyone to reflect on these questions.The AAP chief announced that he would move out of the chief minister's official residence after the ""shraddh"" period during Navratri. “I have only earned your love in 10 years….many people in Delhi are offering me their houses, without rent. I will come to any of your houses and start living with you,” he added.Addressing the public for the first time following his resignation as chief minister, Kejriwal said he resigned because he did not join politics to indulge in corruption or earn money or to sit in the CM's chair. “When I came out of jail, I thought in my mind that until the court does not honourably acquit me, I will not sit on the CM’s chair again. But my lawyers told me that this case can drag on for a very long time, maybe for 10 to 15 years. So, I decided that I will go to the court of my people, who should tell me whether I am honest or not,” he said.Though the programme was called Janta Ki Adalat, there was no dialogue with the public and no questions from the public were taken.Addressing the people gathered at the Jantar Mantar, the AAP chief said it reminded him of the old days at the Jantar Mantar as on April 4, 2011, the biggest anti-corruption movement of independent India, Anna Andolan, commenced from here.“They (the then Central govt) did not listen to us and challenged us to contest and win the election. We were ‘small people’ and did not know how to contest elections. We contested elections, and the people elected us to power,” he said.Kejriwal said that the upcoming elections are not ordinary elections. The upcoming elections in Delhi are ‘Kejriwal's litmus test’. He further added that if they think he is corrupt, they should not press the ‘jhadu’ (broomstick) button in polls.","Arvind Kejriwal posed five questions to RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat at Jantar Mantar.

Kejriwal's 5 questions to Bhagwat

The way (Narendra) Modi ji is breaking parties and bringing down govts across the country by luring them or threatening them with ED and CBI, is this correct?

Modi ji has included the most corrupt leaders in his party, whom he himself called corrupt. Do you agree with such politics?

BJP was born from the womb of RSS, it is the responsibility of RSS to ensure that BJP does not go astray. Have you ever stopped Modi ji from doing wrong things?

JP Nadda said during Lok Sabha elections that he does not need RSS. Has the son grown so much that he has started showing his displeasure? Didn't you feel sad when he said this?

You people (BJP and RSS) have made a law that leaders will retire after 75 years... Amit Shah is saying that this rule will not apply to Modi ji. What applied to Advani ji, why will it not apply to Modi ji?
