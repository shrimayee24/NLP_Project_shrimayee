AAP ’s Delhi state convener Gopal Rai said there was clarity that the alliance with Congress was forged for general elections. “We fought Lok Sabha elections together (with Congress) with honesty. There is no alliance…for Delhi assembly elections. We will fight this battle together with the people of Delhi and win it,” Rai said.

“When the alliance was discussed, both parties were of the firm view that it had to be only for Lok Sabha,” said Delhi Congress interim president Devender Yadav.

NEW DELHI: A full-strength team comprising all NDA partners will take oath along with Narendra Modi at the swearing-in ceremony that is now likely to be held on Sunday evening in the presence of leaders of South Asia countries.Sources said the share of allies in the govt will be finalised in consultations which are likely to start in earnest after Modi is elected leader of the NDA parliamentary party on Friday afternoon.The build-up to govt formation has been marked by speculation about allies claiming important portfolios and seeking to secure representation keeping with the cruciality of their support to BJP. The buzz has persisted despite insistence by these players that they were not engaged in muscle-flexing.However, sources close to BJP as well as the two most significant allies — TDP and JD(U) — said no discussion on portfolios and size of their share had taken place yet. “It is going to be the prime minister's call,” a BJP source said.Meanwhile, official sources said Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu had accepted India’s invite to attend the swearing in. Muizzu is in addition to a cast of leaders from South Asia who would be present — Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina, Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe, Nepalese PM Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Bhutan King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck.Bilateral ties with Maldives have nosedived under Muizzu, who is considered close to China, although he was among the first foreign leaders to congratulate Modi for winning a record-equalling third term.BJP president J P Nadda, defence minister Rajnath Singh and home minister Amit Shah also held consultations with RSS leaders including general secretary Dattatreya Hosabale and senior functionary Suresh Soni, who is seen as an important voice.There were strong indications that the swearing-in may now be held on Sunday instead of Saturday. Authorities were keeping both options open and preparations at Rashtrapati Bhavan have been made accordingly.Amid speculative reports on TV channels that TDP was asking for the post of Speaker, party sources said they had set no such condition. “Even in the case of our leader, late G M C Balayogi who served as Speaker for five years beginning 1999, it was the then PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee who had prevailed over N Chandrababu Naidu to nominate someone from TDP for the constitutional position,” a senior source said.“We have made no demand for any ministry either,” he added.",Full-strength team comprising all NDA partners will take oath along with Narendra Modi.

Postal ballots up 62% in 2024 polls

NEW DELHI: Nearly 65.8% of the country's 97.6 crore electorate came out to vote in the just-concluded general election , though this was 1.6 percentage points less than the 67.1% overall turnout, excluding the postal ballots , recorded in the 2019 edition. Women beat men in terms of turnouts in 19 of the 36 states and Union Territories (UTs), but at the national level, men with a polling percentage of 65.8% were a tad ahead of women with 65.7%.An EC official clarified that the 65.8% overall turnout is based on EVM votes and does not factor in postal ballots.The release of the turnout data for 2024 general election came on a day when the Election Commission — comprising chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar and election commissioners Gyanesh Kumar and Sukhbir Singh Sandhu — called on President Droupadi Murmu to submit a copy of the notification containing list of the newly elected members of 18th Lok Sabha. The commission later visited Rajghat to dedicate the “violence-free polls” to Mahatma Gandhi There is no room for violence in democracy was the upfront commitment with which 18th Lok Sabha elections were announced... the long queues at polling stations and the determination to decide their future through the ballot were testament to Mahatma Gandhi’s cherished ideals and India’s civilisational heritage, EC said in a statement later.It said EC having rebuffed attempts to vitiate the electoral process with rumours and baseless doubts “which could have fomented unrest”. Constituency-wise EVM turnout data for 2024 general election data shows that 204 parliamentary constituencies had a higher turnout by women electors. The last three phases recorded a higherfemale voting percentage , with Phase 7 clocking 64.7% women turnout as against 63.1% among men. In 2019 elections, female voter turnout at 67.2% had exceeded the 67% polling among male electors. As many as 17 states and UTs had witnessed higher turnouts by men as compared to their male counterparts.Lakshadweep recorded highest overall turnout at 84.2%, followed by Assam with 81.6%, Tripura with 80.9% and Andhra Pradesh with 80.7%. Lowest polling state was Bihar with 56.2% turnout, followed by Mizoram with 56.9% and UP, the source of the biggest upset for BJP, with 56.9%.While Dhubri in Assam recorded highest turnout at 92.1%, lowest polling was in Srinagar at 38.5%.The states/UTs where women turnout was higher this time are Bihar, UP, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Assam, Kerala, Odisha, Jharkhand, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Manipur, Nagaland, Meghalaya, Goa, Arunachal Pradesh, Puducherry, Ladakh, Lakshadweep and Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Daman & Diu.Phase-wise analysis shows that the overall turnout was highest in Phase 4 at 69.2%, followed by 66.7% in Phase 2, 66.1% in Phase 1, 65.7% in Phase 3, 63.9% in Phase 7, 63.4% in Phase 6 and 62.2% in Phase 5.Around 37 lakh valid postal ballots were cast in the 2024 general election, up 62% from the 22.8 lakh counted in 2019. The 62% jump in postal ballot count over the last general election, however, is essentially on account of extension of postal ballot facility to newer categories other than service voters; namely senior citizens aged over 85 years, persons with disabilities (PwDs) and those engaged in specified essential services, in 2020. Along with the postal ballots, the overall turnout for the just-concluded polls would be over 66%, though this is still less than the 2019 polling percentage of 67.4%.","Nearly 65.8% of the country's 97.6 crore electorate came out to vote in the just-concluded general election.

RANCHI: In Jharkhand, the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance secured nine out of the 14 seats, with the BJP winning eight and its alliance partner, the Ajsu Party , retaining its single seat. This outcome mirrors the nationwide decline in the appeal of Modi's leadership. On the other hand, the India bloc demonstrated an improved performance, increasing its seat count from two in 2019 to five in the current election.The results in Jharkhand highlight the shifting political landscape, with the BJP's dominance facing challenges from opposition parties. The India bloc's gains suggest a growing support base and a potential shift in voter preferences. As the nation witnesses a change in the political dynamics, it remains to be seen how these developments will shape the future course of governance and policy-making in the state and beyond.The India bloc has secured all the tribal reserved seats in the recent elections. According to analysts, the Enforcement Directorate's actions against Hemant Soren, the working president of the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and former chief minister, were not well-received by the tribal voters.The JMM emerged victorious in Dumka, Singhbhum, and Rajmahal seats, successfully capitalizing on the tribal sentiment. This sentiment was fueled by the BJP-led central government's refusal to include a separate sarna code in the census register, which is a matter of identity for the tribal community.In an attempt to win the Dumka seat, the BJP had nominated Sita Soren, the elder daughter-in-law of Guruji. However, she was defeated by JMM's Nalin Soren, who secured a margin of 22,527 votes.","In Jharkhand, the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance secured nine out of the 14 seats.

NEW DELHI: NDA partners JD(U), led by Nitish Kumar, and Chirag Paswan ’s LJP on Thursday articulated concern over the Agnipath scheme which was used by the opposition to attack govt over inadequate generation of jobs, though the former backpedalled on its comments saying they were twisted out of context.JD(U) general secretary K C Tyagi was the first off the blocks, telling TV news channels that his party, which with 12 MPs may have an outsized role in the BJP-led coalition govt, will insist on a review of the Agnipath scheme under which 75% of recruits, the Agniveers, will be let go of after four years while the rest get to serve for another 15 years.LJP (Ram Vilas) chief Chirag Paswan, in response to a question, told NDTV that govt must revisit the Agnipath scheme to ascertain whether it had delivered the desired results. “If somebody has raised it, the NDA gives us that platform to sit and discuss. Yesterday (Wednesday), in the (NDA) meeting, my PM said on record that he is open to discussion. This platform is open and he is easily available for discussion of concerns and suggestions. If somebody feels or any party feels, I definitely believe that we must revisit that (Agnipath),” he said.Paswan said the govt must carry out an assessment of how much could be delivered through this scheme as it directly concerned youngsters. “If it is beneficial and working for them as per the intention of the scheme and it is getting penetrated well, then we must continue. If not, then we should come up with suggestions of what can be done. But these things can be kept on hold for a while or till govt formation. So, immediately after that, we can sit and discuss all these things,” he said.The comments were interpreted as muscle-flexing by allies whose strength has acquired disproportionate dimension because of BJP lacking its own majority, before Tyagi dialled back by saying that his comments to TV channels were edited out of context.“What is said was in exact sync with the line articulated on several occasions by Rajnath Singh that the scheme is going to be reviewed periodically to look for shortcomings and their removal,” Tyagi said, adding that there were reports of unhappiness among a section of voters in western UP and Rajasthan. “My assertion that JD(U) is part of NDA and has extended unconditional support to the Modi govt was also left out,” he further said.On JD(U)’s support to a Modi-led govt, Tyagi said, “There is no pre-condition, there is unconditional support. But it is in our mind and heart that Bihar should be given special status. After bifurcation, the situation Bihar has faced, it cannot be corrected without granting special status.”On caste census, which was carried out by the Nitish Kumar govt in Bihar with the support of BJP, RJD and all other political parties, Tyagi said, “No party in the country has opposed caste census. Bihar has shown the way, the prime minister also did not oppose... It is the demand of the time, and we will pursue it.”Paswan also backed a caste-wise headcount. “Me and my party do support caste census. There’s a reason behind this because even after seven decades of Independence, there are still schemes and policies which are drafted for the upliftment of a particular caste or section of society. Many times, courts have also asked for the population count of a particular caste. So, I do believe that govt should have these details with it, what is the figure of a particular caste. I’m not in favour of making it public, because that increases the divide,” he said.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had made caste census one of his main campaign themes.Tyagi said JD(U) was not opposed to Uniform Civil Code but all stakeholders should be consulted. “On UCC, the chief minister (Nitish Kumar) had written to the Law Commission. We are not against UCC. But there should be consultation with all stakeholders, chief ministers, political parties and different sects, and a resolution should be found,” he said.","JD(U) general secretary K C Tyagi was the first off the blocks, telling TV news channels that his party will insist on a review of the Agnipath scheme.

Sources said the electoral setbacks and strategies for upcoming elections were also discussed by Sangh members.Earlier, Fadnavis touched down in Nagpur with BJP state chief Chandrashekhar Bawankule, greeted supporters and headed home, leaving Bawankule to address waiting reporters at the airport. After the post-noon huddle with Sangh representatives at his residence, the deputy CM took off for New Delhi.At the airport, Bawankule told reporters the party has requested Fadnavis to remain in his position even though it was natural for him to feel disappointed after BJP’s poor showing. “The opposition’s false narrative had confused voters. The INDIA alliance has nothing to show on development, they misled voters by creating fear of change in the Constitution if BJP returned to office. Now, they are not blaming EVMs as they usually do when they lose. Voters will not tolerate lies and politics of casteism and will vote for development,” he said.Lauding Fadnavis, Bawankule said, “His developmental efforts, both as chief minister and deputy CM, cannot be disregarded. He implemented all the welfare schemes launched by Prime MinistNarendra Modi’s govt and ensured free ration to over 6.5 crore people and worked for farmers’ welfare. But voters were swayed by the opposition’s lies. The Maharashtra BJP unit feels Fadnavis’ leadership is crucial for countering the opposition’s misinformation campaign.”BJP won only nine of 28 LS seats it contested in the state, while its allies, Shiv Sena and NCP, won seven and one seats respectively.

NEW DELHI: A meeting of the opposition INDIA alliance, which announced on Wednesday that it will take appropriate action at an appropriate moment to form govt, saw a demand from TMC that specific mention should be made about an open invite to TDP and JDU. The two regional parties play a crucial role in ensuring that the BJP alliance reaches the majority mark.During a discussion on poll numbers and the road ahead, participants, which included stalwarts of the bloc, expressed an eagerness to form the govt. But at the same time, they conceded that the numbers were stacked clearly in BJP’s favour, specially because of its pre-poll alliance with JD(U) and TDP. It was felt that the opposition could iterate upfront that the mandate was against BJP, while underlining that it will wait and watch for the right moment to stake the claim.It is learnt that TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee suggested that opposition should show some urgency in trying to form govt, and demanded that a mention could be made in the meeting’s resolution stating that the opposition bloc’s doors were open for Chandrababu Naidu and Nitish Kumar But, sources said, the general feeling was that a statement of readiness for any post-poll realignment was enough, and a specific mention naming the parties was not required given the numbers gap between NDA and the opposition.The resolution adopted in the meeting, as read out by Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge , said, “We will take appropriate steps at the appropriate time to realise the people’s desire not to be governed by BJP.”Days after Mamata Banerjee objected to CPM getting a considerable role in INDIA bloc, party neta Abhishek Banerjee Thursday met SP chief Akhilesh Singh and AAP’s Raghav Chadha and Sanjay Singh in Delhi.

Many

Congress seniors in Punjab joined BJP. Will you let them return?

Partap Singh BajwaTOISubodh GhildiyalI and state president Raja Warring worked together. Congress’s biggest handicap has been lack of unity at the top in the state. We lost because then CM Amarinder Singh, Navjot Sidhu and state chief Sunil Jakhar pulled in different directions. For us, the only effective platform available was the Punjab assembly. Our brilliant performance there helped us, despite AAP having 92 MLAs and Congress 18, and lopsided control of camera in the assembly that focused only on treasury benches. Despite that, we put the CM in the dock, called out his misgovernance, took it to the people, and regained acceptance. Had AAP govt not controlled the camera in assembly, we’d have decimated AAP in the LS polls. I even moved HC to seek impartiality in coverage. In the Lok Sabha polls, we’ve gained 38 assembly segments, AAP score has slid from 92 to 32.Punjabis always react against govt excesses and they have reacted against the anti-farmer policies and their treatment during the long struggle. Punjab’s identity is “jai jawan, jai kisan”. But Army recruitment was discontinued and farmers were sidelined, which hurt people. And people heard the arguments that gangsters who killed big names such as Moose Wala, or had abducted people, were roaming free or were lodged in local jails, while some are sent to Dibrugarh without any crime, as such, committed. It’s just reaction. And it’s momentary. One doesn’t know if these two fringe MPs will at all come to Parliament. It’s a one-time vote. We’ll see what happens. Punjabis are careful, and want to maintain peace at all costs.It’s a vote against BJP and Modi. A section was polarised that unfortunately led to counter polarisation. The same formula that was tried 40 years ago is being tried again, for which Punjab is still paying a big price. When you raise a religious slogan to polarise one community for political gains, it can trigger counter polarisation. The fringe element that we’ve controlled for 40 years is again raising its head, just because of current policies, the Centre and its agencies. BJP’s campaign brought it to zero, down from 2. But it led to two fringe elements getting elected. I hold BJP responsible for what’s happening in Punjab, seriously advising BJP don’t fish in troubled waters.From Day 1, I said we won’t touch AAP. Our political stance has been vindicated. Had Congress not allied with AAP in Delhi, it would have won majority of seats. We won 12 in Rajasthan, in UP 43, and in Haryana 5. Delhi’s the same region. Congress and AAP share the same vote base, so an alliance is myopic. We’ve decimated AAP to half in Punjab. From 38 assembly segments, we’ve to now go to 80.We’ll never take back those who back-stabbed the party. Polls have proved they were just big names and faces. Preneet Kaur, wife of Amarinder, lost in her family city. Ravneet Bittu lost in Ludhiana. Rana Sodhi lost from Ferozepur which is BJP state chief’s home. Punjab has shown the door to turncoats who ditched the party for personal benefit. In fact, Punjabis and Bengalis have behaved as one. BJP tried everything but failed miserably in Bengal, the same happened in Punjab.","Congress’s biggest handicap has been lack of unity at the top in the state.

NEW DELHI: Anti-incumbency impacted BJP’s prospects in 2024 Lok Sabha elections in UP, resulting in defeat of 27 of its 49 sitting MPs. In total, BJP had repeated 54 candidates who contested in 2019, but 31 of them failed to secure a win this time around.Among the repeated candidates , 49 were sitting MPs, including Ambedkarnagar nominee Ritesh Pandey, who had switched from BSP to BJP.Of these, 33 MPs were being repeated for the third time or more, but 20 of them lost their seats. The list included notable parliamentarians and Union ministers such as Smriti Irani (Amethi), Ajay Mishra Teni (Kheri), Kaushal Kishore (Mohanlalganj), Mahendra Nath Pandey (Chandauli), Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti (Fatehpur), Bhanu Pratap Singh Verma (Jalaun), and Sanjeev Balyan (Muzaffarnagar).High-profile parliamentarians like eight-term MP Maneka Gandhi (Sultanpur) and Rajveer Singh (Etah), son of ex-CM Kalyan Singh, also faced defeat. Other significant losses included Lallu Singh (Faizabad) and Subrat Pathak (Kannauj).“This clearly shows that people were unhappy with their work, yet BJP brass showed misplaced faith in them,” a political analyst said.Data further revealed that only 14 BJP MPs contesting for the third or more time won, including PM Narendra Modi (Varanasi), Mahesh Sharma (GB Nagar), Bhola Singh (Bulandshahr), Rajnath Singh (Lucknow), and Hema Malini (Mathura). Despite the losses among incumbents , 10 of 21 other BJP candidates, including several first-timers, emerged victorious. Prominent first-time winners included Jitin Prasada (Pilibhit), Chhatrapal Singh Gangwar (Bareilly), Atul Garg (Ghaziabad), Anand Gond (Bahraich), and Karan Bhushan Singh (Kaiserganj).According to political observers, BJP’s decision to repeat 46 of 51 candidates in the first list surprised many, given the local resentment against several of them. “The belief that Modi-Yogi factor will carry them through proved to be misguided,” an observer said.Likewise, 19 candidates, including 16 sitting MPs, contested their second consecutive LS polls. Ten of these, including seven sitting MPs, lost their seats. Notable among them were Pradeep Kumar (Kairana), Ram Shankar Katheria (Etawah), Sangam Lal Gupta (Pratapgarh), Pravin Nishad (Sant Kabir Nagar), and RK Singh Patel.","Anti-incumbency impacted BJP’s prospects in 2024 Lok Sabha elections in UP.

Asked by party not to canvass in NE barring Arunachal: Sarma,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/asked-by-party-not-to-canvass-in-ne-barring-arunachal-sarma/articleshow/110777106.cms,"TOI

GUWAHATI: Assam CM and BJP star campaigner Himanta Biswa Sarma said Thursday the party brass had directed him to refrain from canvassing in northeastern states , except Arunachal Pradesh, because of boundary disputes involving his state and its neighbours.Sarma’s comments came in the wake of NDA’s electoral setbacks in BJP-governed Manipur, where it lost both seats to Congress. Similarly, NDA conceded one seat to Congress in Nagaland, and regional outfit Voice of the People Party (VPP) and Congress secured one each in Meghalaya.According to Sarma, he was asked to “not be seen in these states frequently”, and instead focus his campaign efforts in eastern India, covering Odisha, Jharkhand, and Bengal. “I could not contribute to the best of my abilities in Manipur, Nagaland, and Meghalaya,” said the CM, who is also the convener of BJP-led North-East Democratic Alliance (NEDA), an NDA-like grouping for the region.He attributed NDA’s defeats in these states to the influence of a particular religious community over the electorate. “When religious people take part in politics, politicians cannot compete. You can compete with Congress, BJP, AGP, but how can you compete with the Sankaracharya or Srimanta Sankardeva? When spiritual leaders decide voting patterns, politicians’ roles become minimised,” Sarma said.Further clarifying, he said: “It’s unimaginable that Agatha Sangma (sitting MP of NDA ally NPP) would lose by more than one lakh votes (in Tura, Meghalaya).”Responding to Sarma’s remarks, Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi condemned the CM’s statements. He tweeted: “…He does not have the maturity to accept responsibility for the NDA’s losses in Nagaland, Meghalaya, and Manipur. I appeal to the chief ministers of the respective states to publicly condemn the statement. Together we must preserve the unique identity of the Northeast.”Sarma described the setbacks as specific to this election. “This time they (people) had some grievances and expressed them through voting. It will be erased.”NDA performed well in Assam, winning 11 of 14 seats. The alliance also maintained its dominance in Arunachal and Tripura, securing both seats in each state. BJP also formed its govt in Arunachal, with a landslide victory in simultaneous assembly polls. However, NDA’s overall LS tally of 15 seats in the region was three less than what it achieved in 2019.reported earlier on BJP’s decision to deploy Sarma outside the region, suggesting a strategic move to leverage his skills nationally and potentially groom him for a larger role within the party. This also suggested a deliberate distancing from the complex political climate of North-East, where BJP has had a mixed record.","Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma said the party brass had directed him to refrain from canvassing in northeastern states, except Arunachal Pradesh.

However, they must return to prison after taking oath or completing any official duties allowed by the court. They will need to write to the Speaker under Article 101(4) of the Constitution, which deals with absence of members from either House of Parliament, informing about their ability to attend the House on account of their incarceration, which will be referred to the concerned House committee.As per Achary, both Singh and Rashid can apply for parole later to take part in parliamentary proceedings, including in important businesses.If Rashid or Singh are convicted and jailed for a minimum of two years, they would lose their seats in Lok Sabha immediately.The law also says that they will have to remain Independents and cannot join any party during their term as MP.

Will Mr Naidu finally extract his pound of flesh from Mr Modi? Or will Mr Modi’s 1/3rd govt collapse before he can action anything?”

Ramesh was citing the questions related to Andhra Congress had asked in its “272 questions to PM in 72 days” campaign prior to the elections. Congress highlighted that Modi has ignored the promise made in the reorganisation act during the bifurcation. Congress pointed out that its Nyay Patra (manifesto) has reaffirmed the pledge for special category status for Andhra Pradesh for five years, as promised by Manmohan Singh.

On Bihar, Ramesh asked, “Will you (Modi) give special status to Bihar as promised in 2014 and fulfill your associate Nitish Kumar’s 10 year old demand? Do you promise to get caste census done on the lines of Bihar across the entire country.” In another post he also shared the questions posed to the PM by Congress related to Bihar and asked, “Will Nitish Kumar be able to raise these concerns effectively?

But it is in our mind and heart that Bihar should be given special status. After bifurcation, the situation Bihar faced cannot be corrected without granting special status.”LJP (Ram Vilas) chief Chirag Paswan said govt must carry out an assessment of how much could be delivered through this scheme as it directly concerned youngsters. “If it is beneficial and working for them as per intention of the scheme, then we must continue. If not, we should come up with suggestions of what can be done. But these things can be kept on hold for a while or till govt formation. Immediately after that, we can sit and discuss all these things,” he said.On caste census, which was carried out by Nitish Kumar govt in Bihar with support of BJP, RJD and all other political parties, Tyagi said, “No party in the country has opposed caste census. Bihar has shown the way, the PM also did not oppose... It is the demand of the time, and we will pursue it.”Paswan also backed a caste-wise headcount. “Me and my party do support caste census. There’s a reason behind this. Even after seven decades of Independence, there are still schemes and policies which are drafted for upliftment of a particular caste or section of society. Many times, courts have also asked for the population count of a particular caste. So, I do believe that govt should have these details with it, what is the figure of a particular caste. I’m not in favour of making it public, because that increases the divide,” he said.Tyagi said JD(U) is not opposed to Uniform Civil Code but all stakeholders should be consulted. “On UCC, CM (Nitish Kumar) had written to Law Commission.

Although the law prevents them from participating in the proceedings of the 18th general polls in India, they still possess the Constitutional right to take the oath of office as members of Parliament.According to the Election Commission's announcement on Tuesday, Amritpal Singh, a jailed Sikh preacher, has secured victory in the Khadoor Sahib constituency, while Sheikh Abdul Rashid, also known as ""Engineer Rashid,"" who is currently imprisoned, has won the Baramulla seat.Engineer Rashid has been lodged in the Tihar jail since August 9, 2019 on charges of alleged terror financing, while Singh has been booked under the National Security Act and sent to the Dibrugarh jail of Assam.The question that arises is whether these jailed candidates can be permitted to take the oath of office, and if so, what procedures are involved.PDT Achari, a Constitution expert and former Lok Sabha secretary general, stressed the importance of adhering to Constitutional provisions in such cases. He said that being sworn in as a member of Parliament is a constitutional right, reported PTI.However, due to their current incarceration, Engineer Rashid and Singh must obtain permission from the authorities to be escorted to Parliament for the oath-taking ceremony. After taking the oath, they will be required to return to jail.Achari further clarified the legal aspects by referring to Article 101 (4) of the Constitution, which addresses the absence of members from both Houses of Parliament without prior approval from the Chair.He explained that after taking the oath, they will inform the Speaker in writing about their inability to attend House proceedings. The Speaker will then forward their requests to the House Committee on Absence of Members.The Committee will then make a recommendation on whether the member should be allowed to remain absent from House proceedings. The Speaker will then put the recommendation to a vote in the House.If Engineer Rashid or Singh are convicted and sentenced to a minimum of two years in prison, they will immediately lose their seats in the Lok Sabha, as per the Supreme Court's 2013 judgment.

However, this figure falls significantly short of the impressive 303 seats the party had won in the 2019 elections, meaning it has been unable to convert its vote share into seats this time.Several factors contributed to the loss of over 60 seats. The Samajwadi Party, led by Akhilesh Yadav, made substantial gains in Uttar Pradesh, a crucial state that had played a pivotal role in the Prime Minister's two previous victories. The Samajwadi Party emerged as the star performer of the Congress-led alliance, delivering its best-ever Lok Sabha performance. The BJP's seat count in the state fell from 64 in 2019 to 33, while the NDA's tally dropped to 34.In Maharashtra, the effective collaboration among Congress, Uddhav Thackeray, and Sharad Pawar resulted in a setback for the ruling party's performance. In West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee successfully defended her stronghold.The following is a state-wise breakdown of the election results:","Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to take oath on June 8.
