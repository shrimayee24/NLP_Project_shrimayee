VIP counts on consolidation in the end

A peculiar contest has emerged in Darbhanga’s Gaura Bauram constituency. Amid uncertainty and confusion during seat-sharing within the Mahagathbandhan, RJD had initially allotted the ticket to Afzal Ali Khan. Later, the seat was handed over to Mukesh Sahni’s VIP. Sahni then fielded his younger brother Santosh Sahni from here but Afzal Ali refused to withdraw. Treating this as indiscipline, RJD yesterday expelled Afzal Ali for six years with immediate effect.This sets up a potential split in the Muslim vote between Afzal Ali and Santosh Sahni, this could end up benefiting the BJP.BJP has fielded former IRS officer Sujeet Kumar Singh. His wife Swarna Singh had won from here in the previous election on VIP’s ticket, but later joined BJP. The seat has a sizeable Mallah population, the reason Mukesh Sahni had originally demanded it for himself but eventually nominated his younger brother.RJD insists that Santosh Sahni is the authorised Mahagathbandhan candidate. But on paper, Afzal Ali continues to remain the nominated nominee — something that could complicate Santosh’s prospects. Afzal Ali had lost by barely 7,000 votes the last time when he contested on RJD’s ticket.2.65 lakhMuslim 70k, Yadav 28k, Mallah 26k, Brahmin 33k, Vaishya 20k, Paswan 15k, other SC 25k.BJP’s Sujeet Kumar Singh is from the Rajput community, which is not numerically dominant here. However, he believes he can ride on the BJP’s core vote base plus Mahagathbandhan’s internal rebellion.Speaking to us, he claimed that barring Muslims, every caste group is voting for me. He also claimed a large chunk of Yadavs are backing him. Singh resigned from the IRS only a week before receiving the BJP ticket and believes his “education and clean image” will work as an added advantage.VIP spokesperson Dev Jyoti said within 24 hours of Afzal Ali’s expulsion, the “wind has swung” in VIP’s favour. He expressed confidence that Muslim voters, at the end of the day, will back the candidate best placed to defeat the BJP. He also said the backing of Lalu Prasad Yadav and Tejashwi Yadav is firmly with VIP here.However, some minority voters argue that since RJD had already issued the nomination earlier, Mukesh Sahni shouldn’t have disturbed the seat.","BJP has fielded former IRS officer Sujeet Kumar Singh.

PATNA: Heat and dust of cheek-by-jowl rallies fused with war of words on social media as campaigning ended Tuesday for the first phase of Bihar polls on Nov 6 in 121 of its 243 assembly seats. More than 3.75 crore electors are expected to cast their votes at 45,341 polling stations to decide the fate of 1,314 candidates.As campaigning concluded at 6pm, governing NDA and INDIA bloc-led opposition left no stone unturned to reach out to voters. Union minister Amit Shah addressed three rallies, defence minister Rajnath Singh five, BJP president JP Nadda two and leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi three. PM Narendra Modi interacted with state BJP women workers virtually, and CM Nitish Kumar addressed meetings, as did INDIA bloc's CM face Tejashwi Yadav of RJD. Adding to BJP's blitz, Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma, UP CM Yogi Adityanath, Delhi CM Rekha Gupta and former Union minister Smriti Irani joined the campaign.Prominent seats in this phase include Raghopur, where Tejashwi is hoping for a hat-trick; Mahua, where Tejashwi's elder brother and ex-minister Tej Pratap Yadav is trying his luck with a new outfit; & Tarapur, from where deputy CM Samrat Choudhary of BJP is in the fray.Other key seats are Alinagar, where singer Maithili Thakur is the BJP nominee. In Lakhisarai, another deputy CM, Vijay Kumar Sinha, is trying to save his fort.

Operating 24x7, these hubs are the unsung architects of electoral fortunes, blending AI-driven voter profiling with old-school booth management.BJP's war room is led by Rohan Gupta, a seasoned strategist from BJP's national IT cell.

Home minister Amit Shah has exuded confidence that NDA would comfortably retain Bihar, predicting a tally of 160 to 180 seats in the 243-member assembly. ""We will win more than 160 seats and will form govt in Bihar. It can be higher than 160. It can be 180 also,"" Shah told Times Now during his campaign through Mithila, Belsand, Khutauna and Darbhanga.Responding to Congress MP Rahul Gandhi's repeated barbs at PM Modi over ""nach-gana"" and yoga, Shah hit back: ""When Manmohan Singh became PM, the country got a PM who could not go among the people to talk about himself, his party and their ideology. Why should a PM not campaign? Elections are a celebration of democracy. Communicating with the people is the responsibility of every political party.""Shah added: ""Every time Modi has been abused - even when his mother was insulted - the people of this country have ensured that a lotus blooms in the swamp of hatred. This time too, the same will happen.""On Mahagathbandhan's campaign, Shah said its partners were ""breaking each other's heads"". ""They couldn't declare candidates before the deadline or run an organised campaign.Every third rally of mine is for an alliance partner, every second rally is joint, and one is BJP-only. It's a scientific campaign. Nitishji follows the same. If you've seen such coordination in opposition alliance, please tell us - I haven't. ""Reiterating that NDA is contesting under CM Nitish Kumar's leadership, he said: ""The CM seat is not vacant, and the PM seat is not empty. Nitish Kumar is the CM and Narendra Modi the PM."" Asked if that could change after the polls, Shah replied: ""We can't stop the opposition from what they wish to say."" When questioned about JDU fielding Anant Singh, arrested for the murder of Jan Suraaj supporter Dularchand Yadav, Shah said: ""The decision is JDU's. But Anant Singh, unlike Lalu Prasad, is not convicted.

Iltija launches massive campaign in Budgam as CM Omar holds ‘darbar’ in Jammu,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iltija-launches-massive-campaign-in-budgam-as-cm-omar-holds-darbar-in-jammu/articleshow/125095962.cms,"Photo/Agencies

SRINAGAR: As the battle intensifies for the November 11 bypoll in central Kashmir’s Budgam assembly seat, Mehbooba Mufti-led Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) has placed Iltija Mufti and MLA Waheed Parra at the forefront of its campaign, and their focus remains firmly on cornering J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah.“There are 50 MLAs roaming around Budgam right now, but tell me, where is the one MLA who is missing? It is the CM of Jammu and Kashmir, Omar Abdullah,” Iltija said while addressing election rallies in Budgam on Tuesday.In the Oct 2024 assembly elections, the first after the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019, the National Conference (NC) won 41 of the 90 seats, with Omar securing victories in both the constituencies he contested from --- Budgam and Ganderbal.Omar, however, chose to retain Ganderbal, his home constituency, vacating the Budgam seat. This has given PDP a potent weapon to accuse Omar and NC of betraying people.In the bypoll, NC’s Aga Syed Mehmood is pitted against PDP’s Aga Syed Muntazir Mehdi, with BJP’s Aga Syed Mohsin also in the fray.While the NC leaders are reaching out to people, CM Omar is in Jammu following ‘Darbar Move’, a biannual practice of shifting offices to Jammu in winters and Kashmir in summers.Both Iltija and Waheed are also targeting the Omar govt over PDP’s recent land bill that sought to grant ownership rights to residents who have lived for over 20 years in houses built on state land. PDP had dubbed it as “anti-bulldozer bill,” arguing that it would protect residents facing eviction notices. However, the legislation was jointly opposed by NC, BJP and Congress in the recent assembly session, with Omar saying granting ownership of houses illegally built on state land would “reward encroachers”.“When PDP brought a land bill to safeguard your rights and ensure that your land remains yours, what did they do? BJP called it ‘land jihad’, and Omar Abdullah joined them, calling Kashmiris land grabbers,” Iltija told the people. “Tell me, are you land grabbers? You are the rightful owners of your land, your dignity and your future,” she said.Para alleged the Omar govt had failed to initiate any development work. “In the last one year, have you seen your MLA? Have you seen even a single transformer installed, or any developmental activity?” the PDP MLA asked the people.“We have seen the surrender on Article 370, on waqf, and now a complete governance vacuum. He (Omar) has reduced our entire political struggle to mere business rules and tried to depoliticise Jammu and Kashmir,” Parra saidAccusing Omar of failing to deliver on any of his pre-poll promises, Iltija urged voters to support the PDP’s candidate.","PDP has placed Iltija Mufti and Waheed Parra at the forefront of its campaign.

Will Nitish Kumar's 'Jeevika Didi' Scheme Sway Women Voters? Ground Report From Bihar's Korha

Here's what happened in the first phase:

Nitish's personal appeal to Bihar voters

Jan Suraaj worker's killing sparked political storm

Bahubali behind bars

FIR against Lalan Singh

Chhath Puja politics

Echoes of “jungle raj”

Efforts to woo women voters

Tejashwi’s big poll promise



Tejashwi vs Tej Pratap rift widens



Lalu’s Halloween row



Prashant Kishor steps back



NEW DELHI: Campaigning for the first phase of the Bihar assembly elections, covering 121 constituencies, concluded on Tuesday evening, marking the end of a high-octane political blitz by both the ruling NDA and the opposition INDIA bloc. The campaign officially ended at 6 pm, with top leaders from across the political spectrum making a final push to sway voters.Union home minister Amit Shah addressed three rallies, while defence minister Rajnath Singh covered five public meetings. BJP president JP Nadda led a roadshow and addressed a rally, and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi held three public meetings as part of the opposition’s final outreach.Prime Minister Narendra Modi interacted virtually with the BJP’s women cadre in the state, while chief minister Nitish Kumar held several meetings to consolidate support for the NDA. RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav , meanwhile, crisscrossed the state with a series of rallies, seeking to energise the opposition’s base.Among other prominent campaigners on the final day were Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta, and former Union minister Smriti Irani.Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar released a video message for the voters ahead of assembly elections, thanking them for their support to JD(U) since 2005 and urged them to vote in large to ensure victory of NDA candidatesThe JD(U) supremo also took a dig at Lalu Prasad Yadav over dynastic politics, saying that ""we did nothing for own family.""In a video message, Kumar thanked the people of Bihar for supporting him and his party since 2005 and lashed out at the previous government, saying, ""The situation of the first system was terrible.""The killing of 76-year-old Dularchand Yadav in Mokama turned into one of the most explosive flashpoints of the Bihar election. Yadav, a former strongman campaigning for a Jan Suraaj candidate, was shot dead during a local event, triggering outrage and political blame-games. The Election Commission has sought a detailed report from the state DGP amid rising tension in the area, with parties accusing one another of using violence to sway the poll narrative.Also read: 'Highway man always high': Congress mocks Nitin Gadkari over Bihar poll promises; shares old 'US-style roads' video JD(U) candidate and political heavyweight Anant Singh was arrested in connection with the killing of Dularchand Yadav, days before polling in Mokama. The arrest of the influential leader, long associated with Bihar’s bahubali politics, sent shockwaves through the ruling alliance and reignited debates over crime and politics. Singh’s detention turned the Mokama seat into a high-stakes prestige battle.Union minister Lalan Singh found himself in legal crosshairs after a video of his “controversial” campaign remark went viral. Police registered an FIR against the JD(U) leader following opposition complaints that his statement undermined the Election Commission’s authority. The issue has quickly snowballed into a new controversy, with rival parties accusing Singh of arrogance and misuse of office.As Bihar celebrated the sacred festival of Chhath, the festive fervour blended into plolitics, with leaders across parties are using the festival’s mass appeal to connect with voters, visiting ghats, offering prayers, and invoking cultural pride.During a rally in Bihar's Muzaffarpur, Rahul Gandhi had taken a swipe at the Delhi BJP's preparation for Chhath Puja on the bank of the Yamuna, saying: “They staged a drama and showed the truth of India...The Yamuna has dirty water. If someone drank it, they would either get sick or die. No one can go inside. Later, PM Modi launched a blistering attack on Rahul Gandhi for allegedly insulting Chhathi Maiya, questioning: “Will Bihar and Hindustan forgive those who insulted even Chhathi Maiya for votes?”The BJP and its allies revived the “jungle raj” refrain to corner the RJD, warning voters against a return to the lawlessness of the 1990s. The RJD, led by Tejashwi Yadav, has hit back, calling the charge outdated and irrelevant. However, the “jungle raj” label has once again become a central talking point, an emotive reminder of Bihar’s political past shaping its electoral present.With women emerging as a decisive voting bloc, all major parties ramped up their outreach to female voters. The NDA wooed on welfare schemes, including the Rs 10,000 cash transfer to women 'Mukhyamantri Mahila Rojgar Yojana', to consolidate its support base, while the opposition INDIA bloc countered with Tejashwi Yadav’s promise of Rs 30,000 under their 'Mai Bahin Maan Yojana' on the day of 'Makar Sankranti' (on January 14). From kitchen economics to empowerment slogans, gender-focused messaging has become a defining feature of Bihar’s election campaign.In a high-stakes pre-poll move, RJD neta and INDIA bloc coordination committee chairman Tejashwi Prasad Yadav promised a government job for every household in Bihar and pledged to introduce the legislation within just 20 days of taking office. ""NDA government could not provide jobs to the youth in 20 years, but we will bring the Act within 20 days of coming to power and also ensure its implementation within 20 months,"" Tejashwi said.The sibling rivalry between Lalu Prasad Yadav’s sons, Tejashwi and Tej Pratap, turned vicious as Tejashwi campaigned for the RJD candidate in Mahua, an assembly constituency from where Tej Pratap is contesting after being expelled from the RJD. Tej Pratp is in the fray from Janshakti Janta Dal, the party which he formed ahead of the polls.Tej Pratap’s independent posturing and social-media jibes have forced the RJD leadership into damage control, even as Tejashwi leads the opposition’s charge. The feud has provided fodder for the ruling camp, which paints it as a sign of disunity within the Yadav family.A video of Lalu Prasad Yadav celebrating Halloween with his grandchildren has spiralled into a political flashpoint. BJP leaders accused him of mocking Maha Kumbh but celebrating the Western festival, while RJD supporters dismissed the criticism as petty electioneering. The episode, though trivial, illustrated the charged atmosphere of the Bihar poll.Political strategist-turned-politician Prashant Kishor said he won’t be contesting the upcoming Bihar assembly elections, even as his Jan Suraaj movement fields candidates across select constituencies. The decision, he said, was guided by his party's consensus that he would campaign for all Jan Suraaj's candidates rather than restricting himself to one constituency. However, the opposition mocked him for 'laying down arms before the battle'.Key battlegrounds in the first phase include Raghopur, where RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav is contesting; Mahua, where his brother Tej Pratap Yadav is in the fray with his new political outfit; and Tarapur, where deputy chief minister Samrat Choudhary is testing his electoral strength.Polling for the first phase will be held on November 6, setting the stage for a crucial test of strength between Bihar’s two main political camps.","Campaigning for the first phase of the Bihar assembly elections, covering 121 constituencies, concluded on Tuesday evening.
