NEW DELHI: Congress on Sunday demanded the resignation of finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman after an FIR was registered against her and others in Karnataka pertaining to the now scrapped electoral bond scheme . The party also sought an “objective probe” supervised by the courts to prevent “distortion or subordination”.The case was registered against Sitharaman and others including ED officials and office-bearers of BJP at the state and national levels on Saturday.The complaint was submitted by Adarsh R Iyer, co-president of Janaadhikaara Sangharsha Parishath (JSP), alleging that the accused “committed extortion under the guise and garb of electoral bonds”.At a press conference, Congress’s Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Jairam Ramesh said the FIR against the FM and others was registered at the direction of a special court in Karnataka and Congress had nothing to do with it. They demanded that Sitharaman resign on “moral, legal and political grounds”.Singhvi said his party hoped that that through the judicial process, those involved in this “corruption” would be summoned and their statements recorded and on that basis they would be arrested.Talking about the case registered in Bengaluru, Singhvi said Sitharaman was accused number one in the FIR, besides ED, BJP functionaries and others as they had allegedly “conspired together to extort money from companies through the electoral bond scheme”.“The finance minister cannot do this on her own. We know who is number one and number two (in government) and this was done on whose directions,” he said.","The case was registered against Sitharaman and others including ED officials and office-bearers of BJP at the state and national levels on Saturday.
