They have completely discriminated against most of the states. So the INDIA alliance meeting was held on how to oppose it,"" said Congress general secretary KC Venugopal after attending the party meeting.Reacting to the Union Budget, leader of the opposition and Congress MP Rahul Gandhi called it a ""K"" (save chair budget), in an apparent dig at the central government that stays in power with support of Nitish Kumar's 12 JD(U) MPs and Chandrababu Naidu's 16 TDP MPs.""'Kursi Bachao' Budget. Appease Allies: Hollow promises to them at the cost of other states. Appease Cronies: Benefits to AA with no relief for the common Indian. Copy and Paste: Congress manifesto and previous budgets,"" Rahul Gandhi posted on X.Congress also alleged that several announcements in the Budget were copy-pasted from the party's 2024 manifesto.Senior P Chidambaram took a swipe at the government and said he is glad that finance minister Sitharaman has read the Congress 2024 manifesto after the Lok Sabha poll results. In a post on X, Chidambaram said, ""I am glad to know that the Hon'ble FM has read the Congress Manifesto LS 2024 after the election results. I am happy she has virtually adopted the Employment-linked incentive (ELI) outlined on page 30 of the Congress Manifesto.""""I am also happy that she has introduced the Apprenticeship scheme along with an allowance to every apprentice spelt out on page 11 of the Congress Manifesto. I wish the FM had copied some other ideas in the Congress Manifesto. I shall shortly list the missed opportunities,"" the former finance minister said.Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress hit out at the government calling it ""Andhra-Bihar Budget!"". The party called the Union Budget the chance of saving the power. ""Kursi bachane ki akhri prayas!"" it said.""This BUDGET is a complete failure with ZERO WARRANTY, presented by a FAILED FINANCE MINISTER OF A FAILED GOVERNMENT. Instead of tackling urgent issues like unemployment, rising prices and growing inflation, the BJP has crafted a budget to bribe its coalition partners and buy time before the government IMPLODES!"" TMC's Abhishek Banerjee said.""There is an English proverb which says that the tail wags the dog, and that's the political message of this Budget,"" Congress leader Manish Tiwari said. ""It has political compulsions written all over it,"" he added.Post the budget presentation, Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi said, ""I think this budget should be called 'PM Sarkaar Bachao Yojana' because they have realised if they want to save this Govt for the next 5 years, they would need their alliance partners to be happy. After denying a special status to Bihar and Andhra Pradesh, they have given them funds. Maharashtra continues to be ignored by the Centre.""After the Budget, Tamil Nadu CM announced that he would boycott the NITI Aayog meeting convened by PM Narendra Modi. The chief minister said that his move is aimed at condemning the Union Budget, which he claimed ""ignored"" the southern state and as a response, he said that DMK MPs will stage a protest on July 24.Stalin also argued that the central government ""boycotted Tamil Nadu"" in the UnionBudget, according to news agency PTI.",Third day of the Budget session is set for a massive showdown.

It will impact qualification status of the candidates, with some potentially crossing the qualifying 50 percentile, while others who had previously qualified may fall below eligibility mark.Vindicated by SC decision , Pradhan said ""truth has prevailed"" and accused leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi of trying to create ""anarchy"" and ""civil unrest"". SC held that there was no evidence to conclude the exam was ""vitiated"" due to a ""systemic breach"" of its sanctity.On Rahul's remark in Lok Sabha on Monday, in which the LoP alleged that the ""entire exam system of the country has become a fraud and can be bought"", Pradhan demanded an apology and accused the Congress leader of undermining the exam system and inciting unrest.""Opposition's role became clear after SC's judgment today. The attitude adopted by Lok Sabha LoP until yesterday, invalidating the examination system of the country and calling it 'rubbish', proves his mental status. By criticising this, Rahul Gandhi has criticised India. Misleading the students of the country, creating confusion, and provoking them for social tensions were all planned parts of his politics. By rejecting the electoral results in the country, anarchy and civil unrest have become a part of his strategy,"" Pradhan said.He also urged the LoP and other opposition members who had spoken against the examination to ""apologise to the students, youth and parents"" of the country.""You have hurt the country, attempted to create anarchy, and conspired to incite civil unrest. The country will not forgive you.
