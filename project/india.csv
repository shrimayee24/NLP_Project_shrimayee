History of Exit Polls

Difference between opinion poll and exit poll

When will the exit poll be declared?

NEW DELHI: The assembly elections in four states- Arunachal Pradesh Sikkim , Odisha , and Andhra Pradesh were concluded along with the Lok Sabha elections and now all have turned their attention to exit poll predictions which will be released on Saturday evening.Researchers conduct exit polls by asking questions from voters immediately after they have cast their ballots at the polling station. The purpose of these polls is to forecast the outcome of the election using the data gathered from voters on the day of the election itself.Exit polls serve as a tool to gauge the sentiment of the electorate and provide an early indication of the likely winners and losers. However, the accuracy of exit polls has been a subject of debate, as they have been known to miss the mark in some instances.Exit polls in India have a long history, with the Delhi-based Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) being the pioneer in developing indigenous exit polls in the 1960s. However, it wasn't until the 1980s that media poll surveys became prominent.During this period, psephologist Prannoy Roy collaborated with David Butler to conduct in-depth studies on Indian elections. Their research and findings were compiled into the influential book ""The Compendium of Indian Elections,"" co-authored by Prannoy Roy, David Butler, and Ashok Lahiri. This publication marked a significant milestone in the analysis and understanding of electoral trends in India.Opinion polls are surveys which are carried out to find the voter sentiment regardless if they wish to vote or not, prior to the actual voting process. However, exit polls are performed immediately after individuals have exercised their right to vote on the designated election day.The exit poll of Assembly elections in Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha will be announced on Saturday, after 6:00 pm.The assembly elections in Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim were held on April 19 in first phase while assembly polls in Andhra Pradesh were held in the fourth phase on May 13. Meanwhile, Odisha assembly elections were held in four phases from May 13 to June 1.The results for the Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim assembly elections will be declared on June 2 while results for Odisha and Andhra Pradesh will be announced on June 4.","The exit poll of Assembly elections in Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha will be announced on Saturday, after 6:00 pm.

NEW DELHI: As Arvind Kejriwal 's three-week temporary bail for poll campaigning comes to an end on Sunday, the Delhi chief minister and AAP convenor is set to return to Tihar jail later in the day. Despite this development, the party has assured its top functionaries that Kejriwal will continue to serve as chief minister.In light of the current situation, Sunita Kejriwal, Arvind Kejriwal's wife, will once again take on the role of intermediary between the party's top functionaries and the national convener. Since Kejriwal's imprisonment, Sunita Kejriwal 's involvement in the party has increased, acting as a bridge between her husband and the party.A senior party member said, ""Kejriwalji will continue to be CM. We are waiting for the poll results. If INDIA wins then, we do not have to worry as investigation agencies will not continue to be misused. But if BJP wins, CM will continue to be Kejriwal because it is people of Delhi who want him there.""Meanwhile, BJP functionaries have stated that they will intensify their demand for Kejriwal's resignation after the Lok Sabha election results are announced. They argue that the state government cannot effectively function with the Chief Minister in jail.""There is a water crisis and development projects are not being executed. So, we will press for Kejriwal’s resignation because the people of Delhi are suffering,"" said a BJP functionary.

'Do not know when I will come out', says Kejriwal

'I will be worried about you': Kejriwal

Plea hearing on June 5

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday surrendered at Tihar jail after paying obeisance at Mahatma Gandhi's memorial at Rajghat and praying at the Hanuman Temple in Connaught Place. He also went to the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) office and met with workers and party leaders.The CM was flanked by his wife Sunita, Delhi ministers and other top AAP leaders throughout his 'journey' back to jail.Moments after Kejriwal surrendered at Tihar jail after his Supreme Court-ordered interim bail came to an end, a Delhi court sent him to judicial custody till June 5.The court noted that the Enforcement Directorate (ED) recently moved an application seeking judicial custody of Arvind Kejriwal. The application was pending as he was on interim bail.After his surrender on Sunday, the application was taken by the Duty Judge of Rouse Avenue Court. Judge Sanjeev Aggarwal decided to send him to judicial custody till June 5.Kejriwal was produced from jail via video conferencing.Before surrendering, Kejriwal addressed party workers at the AAP HQ in Delhi.""The Supreme Court granted me bail for 21 days to campaign for elections. I want to thank SC for that. Today, I am going to Tihar Jail again. I did not waste even a minute of these 21 days. I did not campaign only for AAP but for various parties. I want to say to the people of Delhi that I am going to jail again, not because I have done a scam but because I have raised my voice against dictatorship ... PM Modi accepted this in front of the country that he does not have any evidence against me.""""PM Modi said in an interview that I believe that there is no proof or recovery against Kejriwal because he is an experienced thief. Let's assume that I am an experienced thief, you don't have any proof or any recovery against me so you put me in jail without any proof?... He gave a message to the whole country that if I can put him in jail in a fake case, then what is your stand? I will arrest anyone and put them in jail. I am fighting against this dictatorship and our country cannot tolerate this kind of dictatorship,"" he said at the party HQ.Lashing out at the exit polls which have predicted a resounding victory for the NDA, Kejriwal said: ""Take it in writing, all these exit polls are fake. One exit poll gave 33 seats to BJP in Rajasthan whereas there are only 25 seats there ... The real issue is why they had to do a fake exit poll 3 days before the day of counting. There are several theories regarding this, one of them is that they are trying to manipulate the machines (EVMs).""""I went to Connaught Place where I sought blessings of Lord Hanuman at the Hanuman Mandir. June 4 is also Tuesday and Lord Hanuman will destroy the dictators in our nation,"" he added.""Bhagat Singh said that when the power becomes a dictatorship, then jail becomes a responsibility ... Bhagat Singh was hanged to free the country. This time when I am going to jail, I don't know when I will come back ... If Bhagat Singh was hanged, I am also ready to be hanged,"" said the CM.Kejriwal was released from prison on May 10 on interim bail granted by the Supreme Court in a money laundering case linked to the alleged Delhi excise policy scam, to campaign in the Lok Sabha polls. The polls ended on June 1.""On orders of the honourable Supreme Court, I came out from prison for election campaign for 21 days. Many thanks to the honourable Supreme Court,"" he said in a post in Hindi on 'X'.""Today, I will go to Tihar and surrender. I will leave home at 3 pm. First, I will go to Rajghat and pay homage to Mahatma Gandhi. From there, I will go to Hanuman Temple in Connaught Place to seek blessings of Hanuman ji. And from there, I will go to the party office and meet with workers and party leaders. From there, I will leave for Tihar,"" the chief minister said.""All of you take care of yourselves. I will be worried about you. If you are happy then your Kejriwal will also be happy in jail. Jai Hind,"" he added.With his three-week temporary bail for poll campaign ending, Kejriwal surrendered at Tihar jail as a CBI-ED court put off till June 5 its order on his plea seeking interim bail on medical grounds.The CM had approached the CBI-ED court after the Supreme Court registry refused an urgent listing of his plea seeking seven-day extension of the interim bail in which he stated he needed time to undergo medical tests as he was losing weight and was having high ketone level.On Saturday, Kejriwal had held a meeting of the AAP's Political Affairs Committee at his residence before attending an INDIA bloc meeting at Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge's home.Prominent AAP leaders, including Cabinet minister Atishi, Rajya Sabha MPs Raghav Chadha and Sanjay Singh, and MLA Durgesh Pathak attended the PAC meeting, with media reports stating the CM emphasised the need to keep unity among the party leaders in his absence.It was also emphasised that Kejriwal will remain CM, and his wife Sunita Kejriwal will continue to convey his messages to party leaders, volunteers and the people of Delhi, media reports said citing sources.The Enforcement Directorate had opposed Kejriwal's interim bail plea, arguing he campaigned throughout the elections, but ""now when he has to surrender, he suddenly claims to be ill"".Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva said the chief minister should stop his ""illness drama"" and go back to the jail if he has any respect for law.The case being probed by the ED relates to alleged corruption and money laundering in the formulation and execution of the Delhi government's now-scrapped excise policy for 2021-22.",Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal surrendered at Tihar jail after his Supreme Court-ordered interim bail came to an end.

"After Jairam Ramesh alleged Amit Shah called DMs, EC says furnish details",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-jairam-ramesh-alleged-amit-shah-called-dms-ec-says-furnish-details/articleshow/110646031.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a firm counter, Election Commission on Sunday asked Congress neta Jairam Ramesh to back up his charge that Amit Shah had been calling up and “intimidating” district magistrates (DMs), who are also returning officers (ROs), ahead of counting, and sought details of the DMs contacted by the home minister as well as the factual basis of his “information”.In a letter to Ramesh on Sunday, EC noted that “the process of counting of votes is a sacred duty cast upon every RO and such public statements by a senior, responsible and experienced leader tend to put an element of doubt and thus, deserves to be addressed in larger public interest”. While underlining that no DM had reported any such attempt at undue influence, EC sought details and information from Ramesh that “he believes to be true”.“You, being a responsible, experienced and very senior leader of a national party, must have made such public statement, just before the day of counting, based on facts/information you believe to be true. It is requested that details of 150 DMs to whom such calls have been allegedly made by the home minister along with the factual matrix/basis of your information are shared by 1900 hours today... ie June 2, so that appropriate action can be taken,” EC said in its letter to the Congress general secretary in charge of communications.Significantly, EC has scheduled a press conference on Monday where it is likely to speak on several issues, including the “pattern” of doubts being raised on well-established electoral processes during general elections.Ramesh had, in a post on X on Saturday, claimed that “the outgoing home minister has been calling up DMs/collectors and had spoken to 150 DMs thus far”. “This is blatant and brazen intimidation, showing how desperate the BJP is. Let it be very clear: the will of the people shall prevail, and on June 4, Modi, Shah, and BJP will exit, and the INDIA Janbandhan will be victorious. Officers should not get under any pressure and must uphold the Constitution. They are under watch,” he had said.During the period of enforcement of model code of conduct, all officers are deemed to be on deputation to the EC and report directly to it.EC has been proactive through this election in either rebutting uncorroborated allegations — as it did in the case of Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge ’s charge that there was mismanagement and delay in release of EVM data, even terming it a biased and deliberate attempt at spreading confusion.“EC cannot be a mute spectator to ‘shoot and scoot’ attacks by politicians, especially when they tend to create confusion in the minds of voters about electoral processes or create a false narrative. People tend to believe senior leaders, who should be responsible and desist from making unverified claims and attacks,” an EC functionary said.On Sunday, the Delhi chief electoral officer rebutted Congress neta Ajay Maken’s allegation — also made via a social media post — that the candidates’ counting agents would not be allowed at the assistant returning officer’s table. “It is clarified that counting agents of candidates are allowed at the tables of RO/AROs,” the Delhi CEO’s office posted on his official handle.","EC asks Congress neta Jairam Ramesh to back up his charge that Amit Shah had been calling up and “intimidating’ district magistrates.

Porsche teen's parents' DNA test critical to prove blood swap: Cops,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/porsche-teens-parents-dna-test-critical-to-prove-blood-swap-cops/articleshow/110645954.cms,"PUNE: The prosecution in the May 19 Porsche crash case told a special court on Sunday that the police needed to collect blood from the 17-year-old's parents for DNA fingerprinting as part of their investigation into the blood sample manipulation. The crash had left two software engineers in Kalyaninagar dead.Crime branch's investigating officer Sunil Tambe produced the teenager's parents before special judge AS Waghmare and moved a plea through the prosecutor, seeking their remand for seven days. The prosecutor said that the police wanted to question the couple in front of the two Sassoon General Hospital doctors and a class IV employee to unravel the entire transaction till the blood sample was changed.The police also needed to arrest the two men, one of whom facilitated a contact between the teenager's father, a prominent city builder, and Dr Ajay Taware, and the other who, at the builder's behest, handed over Rs 3 lakh to Dr Shrihari Halnor, the prosecutor told the court. The duo, who was captured in the cameras on the hospital premises, is a vital link in the probe, Tambe said.According to the police, Dr Halnor collected blood from the minor but did not store it in a vial. Later, he drew sample from his mother, labelled a vial with the teenager's name, and sent it to the forensic science laboratory to test for alcohol content, Tambe said. The police officer said that they wanted to find that syringe containing the minor's blood which they suspected to have been given by Dr Halnor to the teenager's parents for disposal.The special court granted the parents' police custody till June 5.","The crash had left two software engineers in Kalyaninagar dead.

What the exit polls predicted

NEW DELHI: A day after the exit poll results of the Lok Sabha elections 2024 gave a historic third term for Prime Minister Narendra Modi with the NDA securing 350-400 seats, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi dismissed the pollsters terming it ""Modi media poll"" and ""fantasy poll"". The BJP , however, dismissed him with ""daydreaming"" jibe.""It is not exit poll, it is Modi media poll. It is his fantasy poll,"" the Congress leader told reporters after meeting with party's Lok Sabha MPs via video conference.When questioned about the number of seats the INDIA alliance would secure, Gandhi said, ""Have you heard Sidhu Moose Wala 's song '295'? So 295 (seats).""When asked about the remark, BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad took a jibe at the Congress leader and said, ""There is no bar for daydreaming in India. The exit polls are only reflecting the exact poll. We will cross 400 in Delhi (Centre) and 40 in Bihar.""The opposition INDIA bloc leaders on Sunday rejected the exit poll results of Lok Sabha elections 2024 as most pollsters gave 350-400 seats to the BJP-led NDA government. The exit polls, released last night, predicted historic third term for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Discarding the predictions, the Opposition leaders reiterated that the INDIA bloc will win 295 seats.Aam Aadmi Party chief and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal rejected the exit poll results calling it a fraud poll. ""What was the need for the BJP to conduct these fake polls just three days before election results?"" asked Kejriwal.Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav questioned the credibility of the exit polls, alleging that they were prepared months in advance and only being shown on TV channels now, creating scope for ""fraud"". He insisted that the opposition had already pointed out that ""pro-BJP media"" would show the ruling party crossing 300 seats in the Lok Sabha.Congress leader Jairam Ramesh accused PM Modi of conspiring and managing the exit polls, asserting that there will be a significant difference between the exit polls and the actual results on June 4. He stated that the INDIA alliance had a detailed discussion on numbers and it's impossible for them to get anything below 295 seats.Expressing confidence, Telangana chief minister Revanth Reddy said the Congress will win at least 10 of the 17 Lok Sabha seats in the state and that the INDIA bloc would form a government at the Centre. He cited a post by BJP on 'X', where the saffron party claimed it would get four-five Lok Sabha seats in Telangana.The exit polls, released on Saturday, unanimously predicted a third term for PM Modi, with NDA expected to perform at least as well as it did in 2019, potentially surpassing the 350-seat mark. Some polls even suggested that BJP's pre-poll target of crossing 400 seats could be achieved.The polls also highlighted BJP's remarkable expansion in the eastern and southern states, particularly in West Bengal and Odisha, where it is projected to outperform the incumbent parties. In Bengal, BJP is expected to win between 19 and 31 of the 42 seats, while in Odisha, projections range from 9 to 20 of the state's 21 seats, with BJD potentially winning a maximum of 10 seats.According to the exit polls, the INDIA alliance is expected to win a maximum of 182 seats, with one poll even suggesting the possibility of the alliance falling below the 100-seat mark.While exit polls are generally considered more accurate than opinion polls conducted before elections, their track record in India has been mixed, with both successes and failures. The counting of votes will be done on June 4.","Congress leader Rahul Gandhi dismissed the pollsters terming it ""Modi media poll"" and ""fantasy poll"" The BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad took a jibe at the Congress leader and said, ""There is no bar for daydreaming in India"" Opposition leaders reiterated that the INDIA bloc will win 295 seats.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110637213,imgsize-1298087,width-400,resizemode-4/110637213.jpg"

As exit polls indicated a likely third term for PM Narendra Modi and his BJP-led NDA, members of opposition INDIA bloc raised doubts about the credibility of the data on Sunday.Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi and the current chief Mallikarjun Kharge alleged that the exit polls were designed to create a favourable perception for Modi and BJP , while suggesting that the party may be engaging in some form of manipulation.Gandhi called the exit polls ""Modi media poll"", saying: ""This is Modi ji's poll, it is a fantasy poll."" Asked how many seats INDIA bloc would secure, he said: ""Have you heard (slain Punjabi rapper) Sidhu Moose Wala's song '295'? We are winning 295 (seats).""West Bengal CM and Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee dismissed the exercise as ""vague, fake, and done by BJP stooges"". ""I do not believe in it,"" she said thrice to emphasise her lack of faith in exit polls. ""Those who are working for a high-voltage Modi win, let me tell them that the (post-poll) mathematics is not so easy this time. How long govt (at Centre) will last is doubtful.""Banerjee alleged that the exit polls were prepared two months ago and conducted by a purportedly biased agency with ties to BJP.Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav echoed Banerjee's sentiments, labelling the exit polls as a tool of ""pro-BJP media"" designed to manipulate public perception. He suggested that the exit polls, which he said were prepared months in advance, could pave the way for fraudulent practices.""Based on this exit poll, BJP wants to benefit from the share market which opens Monday. If these exit polls were not false and BJP was not losing, then BJP would not have blamed its own people. The disappointed faces of BJP functionaries are showing the truth,"" Yadav said.In Tamil Nadu, both DMK and BJP's former ally AIADMK rejected the exit poll findings. DMK spokesperson TKS Elangovan dismissed predictions of BJP victories in the state and its neighbouring regions, asserting that INDIA bloc would sweep all 39 constituencies in Tamil Nadu.Elangovan said exit polls suggesting a surge in seats for BJP in Karnataka, Telangana and Kerala is flawed. ""In Karnataka, only recently Congress defeated BJP in assembly polls. In Telangana, Congress formed govt by defeating BRS,'' he said.In Bihar, exit polls conducted by different agencies have shown varying results, with LJP (RV) of Chirag Paswan projected to win ""4-6"" seats and CPM ""2-3"" seats in Jharkhand. RJD criticised the discrepancies, particularly noting the projection of LJP (RV) winning more seats than the five it contested.In Maharashtra, pollsters projected that BJP, despite aligning with CM Eknath Shinde's Shiv Sena and Ajit Pawar's NCP, will not hit the 41 tally it won in 2019. Sena minister Deepak Kesarkar expressed confidence in his party's performance, despite the challenges of last-minute candidate announcements."," exit polls indicated a likely third term for PM Narendra Modi and his BJP-led NDA.

NEW DELHI: The opposition INDIA bloc leaders on Sunday rejected the exit poll results of Lok Sabha elections 2024 as most pollsters gave 350-400 seats to the BJP-led NDA government . The exit polls , released last night, predicted historic third term for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Discarding the predictions, the Opposition leaders reiterated that the INDIA bloc will win 295 seats.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, speaking to reporters, said: ""It is not exit poll, it is Modi media poll.

Congress will emerge as the biggest party with the biggest numbers...""Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav questioned the credibility of the exit polls, alleging that they were prepared months in advance and only being shown on TV channels now, creating scope for ""fraud"". He insisted that the opposition had already pointed out that ""pro-BJP media"" would show the ruling party crossing 300 seats in the Lok Sabha.Congress leader Jairam Ramesh accused PM Modi of conspiring and managing the exit polls, asserting that there will be a significant difference between the exit polls and the actual results on June 4. He stated that the INDIA alliance had a detailed discussion on numbers and it's impossible for them to get anything below 295 seats.Expressing confidence, Telangana chief minister Revanth Reddy said the Congress will win at least 10 of the 17 Lok Sabha seats in the state and that the INDIA bloc would form a government at the Centre. He cited a post by BJP on 'X', where the saffron party claimed it would get four-five Lok Sabha seats in Telangana.AAP's Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh dismissed the exit polls as biased and labeled them as ""Modi's exit poll"". He said discussions within the INDIA bloc suggests they would secure 295 seats based on feedback from party members. Singh argued that exit polls, with their limited sample size compared to India's vast population, hold little significance.Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress also rejected the exit poll predictions regarding the 42 Lok Sabha seats in West Bengal, stating that they believe in people's mandate. TMC's Santanu Sen claimed that most exit polls predicted a BJP victory in the 2021 assembly elections, but the actual results showed TMC winning a two-thirds majority. He asserted that TMC will win more than 30 Lok Sabha seats in the state.The Lok Sabha exit polls released on Saturday predicted that the BJP-led NDA will not only win a third term but may better its 2019 results of 353 seats.The 2024 Lok Sabha polls were held in 7 phases from April 19 to June 1. Some states like Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Bihar saw polling across all 7 phases while states like Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Himachal and Punjab saw single-phase voting.
