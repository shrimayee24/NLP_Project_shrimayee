EC sources say demand neither new nor tenable,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ec-sources-say-demand-neither-new-nor-tenable/articleshow/122102823.cms,"NEW DELHI: New Delhi: Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi ’s insistence that the Election Commission share a machine-readable, digital copy of the Maharashtra electoral roll, appears to have overlooked an important aspect: a similar prayer made by senior Congress leader Kamal Nath before the Supreme Court was rejected way back in 2018.Interestingly, arguing the case on behalf of the petitioner was none other than Abhishek Manu Singhvi, now member of the Congress’s Empowered Action Group of Leaders and Experts (EAGLE) that monitors the conduct of elections in the country.A two-judge Supreme Court Bench had, in its ruling dated October 12, 2018 in the case Kamal Nath Vs ECI and Others, held that it “finds force in the submission of ECI (that) Clause 11.2.2.2 of the election manual only uses the expression “text mode”. As per the clause, the draft roll must be put on the concerned chief electoral officer’s (CEO’s) website in a text mode and no photographs shall appear against the elector’s details.The Bench explained that a draft roll in text mode was already supplied to the petitioner ahead of the 2018 polls in Madhya Pradesh. Clause 11.2.2.2 “nowhere says that the draft electoral roll has to be put up on the CEO’s website in a ‘searchable PDF’.Therefore, the petitioner cannot claim, as a right, that the draft electoral roll should be placed on the website in a ‘searchable mode’. It has only to be in ‘text mode’ and it is so provided,” ruled the SC Bench comprising Justice A K Sikri and Justice Ashok Bhushan. It also cited “issues of privacy of voters” as EC’s reasons for not providing the draft electoral roll in a searchable PDF format.“ECI has directed its field level functionaries to put only the ‘Image PDF’ of electoral roll in the public domain. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the format in which the draft electoral roll is supplied to the petitioner fulfils the requirement contained in the election manual....If the petitioner so wants, he can always convert it into searchable mode which, of course, would require him to put his own efforts,” the Bench stated.EC officials on Thursday cited this 2018 verdict to underline that the Congress’s demand for “searchable or machine-readable rolls” is not new and forms part of its strategy for well over eight years, a fact that appears to have been selectively obscured in the present representation.“The demand reiterated by Gandhi, albeit consistent with the position historically maintained by the Congress, is not tenable within the contours of the prevailing legal framework...this very issue has already been agitated by the Congress party before the highest court of the country,” said an EC functionary“It appears that Gandhi may not have been appropriately apprised of the finality with which the matter stands concluded in judicial record,” the functionary noted.","A similar prayer made by senior Congress leader Kamal Nath before the Supreme Court was rejected way back in 2018.

'Apologise to Biharis': Prashant Kishore's 'bada bada gyan' swipe at Rahul Gandhi; accuses Congress of doing 'historic injustice',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/apologise-to-biharis-prashant-kishores-bada-bada-gyan-swipe-at-rahul-gandhi-accuses-congress-of-doing-historic-injustice/articleshow/122093835.cms,"Prashant Kishore (File photo)

NEW DELHI: As Bihar braces for a high-stakes assembly election later this year, political sparring has intensified with Jan Suraaj Party chief Prashant Kishor taking direct aim at Rahul Gandhi , the leader of the opposition in the Lok Sabha.In a sharp remark, Kishor questioned Gandhi’s commitment to Bihar and accused the Congress of decades-long neglect and tokenism.In a recent interview with news agency ANI, Kishor, who has been traversing Bihar’s rural interiors as part of his Jan Suraaj campaign, threw a gauntlet at the Congress leader, daring him to spend just a single night in a village in the state to demonstrate any real grassroots engagement.""Rahul ji keeps coming and going here, but doesn't really undertake any Yatra. If Rahul Gandhi has ever spent even one night in a village in Bihar, let us know. If he can spend just one night in a village, we'll accept it,"" Kishor said.(You sit in Delhi, laugh at Biharis then come here to lecture us),"" he added, underscoring what he described as a condescending attitude from the Congress high command.Kishor also turned his fire on Telangana chief minister Revanth Reddy for allegedly disparaging Biharis, demanding an apology and criticising the Congress party for enabling such attitudes.""In Telangana, their chief minister is Revanth Reddy, it's been two years since he became CM. Before that, he was in the TDP (Telugu Desam Party), and before that, he was in the RSS and the BJP. After becoming chief minister, he officially stated that doing labour is in the DNA of Biharis. Biharis are born to do labour work. Why did he say this? Because most of his rival KCR's officers had a Bihar background. So he was implying that Telangana is in a bad state because Biharis are running it. And to justify that, he added another statement saying it's in Biharis' DNA to do labour, and that's why KCR appointed them as bureaucrats,"" Kishor said.(You say Biharis are born to do labour work, and then come here and preach to us?)"" he told ANI in an interview.Recalling an unfulfilled promise from decades ago, Kishor also invoked former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi’s 1989 commitment to turn Bihar into a development hub.“Where did that money go? Congress remained in power afterwards, so tell us, what did you do for Bihar?” he asked.He further demanded that Rahul Gandhi issue an apology for what he called the “historic injustice” inflicted upon Biharis by the Congress.""If Congress apologised for the injustice done to Sikhs, then Rahul Gandhi should apologise to Biharis as well before campaigning in Bihar. If Biharis are only born for labour, then why are you coming here? Just go campaign in Telangana and get your votes there,"" Kishor said.Taking a dig at Congress’s electoral relevance in the state, Kishor said its future in Bihar rests entirely on “Lalu ji’s charity”.""Congress has no real existence in Bihar. For the past 25-30 years, it's been a party that just carries Lalu ji's bag. If Rahul Gandhi truly has political strength, let him contest elections in Bihar on his own. Try demanding 40 per cent of the seats from Lalu ji and see what happens. In Bihar, Congress dances to Lalu ji's tune. Whatever he decides, that's what happens,"" he said.The Bihar assembly elections are expected to be held in October or November this year, though the Election Commission of India is yet to announce the official dates.The ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA), comprising the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Janata Dal (United), and Lok Janshakti Party (LJP), will look to retain power.On the other side, the Opposition’s INDIA bloc, consisting of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Congress, and the Left parties, aims to unseat CM Nitish Kumar.Kishor’s Jan Suraaj Party is positioning itself as a third alternative, aiming to disrupt the traditional bipolar contest in the state.In the current 243-member Bihar assembly, the NDA holds a majority with 131 seats -- BJP has 80 MLAs, JD(U) 45, HAM(S) 4, and support from two Independents. The INDIA bloc has a strength of 111, led by the RJD with 77 MLAs, Congress with 19, and the Left parties accounting for the rest.","Bihar braces for high-stakes assembly election later this year.

Many from Congress to select





HYDERABAD: After a lull of over a year, electoral heat is returning to Hyderabad with the upcoming by-election in the high-proﬁle Jubilee Hills assembly constituency. Triggered by the recent death of BRS MLA Maganti Gopinath, the bypoll—likely to be held well before the Dec deadline—has become a prestige contest for all three major parties: Congress, BRS, and BJP.For the ruling Congress, the bypoll is a chance to open its account in the state capital, where it failed to win a single seat in the 2023 elections. With the party having recently snatched the Secunderabad Cantonment seat from BRS in a by-election held alongside the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, it now hopes to replicate that success in Jubilee Hills.The constituency also holds added signiﬁcance for the BJP, as it falls under the Secunderabad parliamentary segment, represented by Union minister and state BJP chief G Kishan Reddy.But the Congress isn’t just eyeing a seat—it’s eyeing a cabinet reshufﬂe. With no Greater Hyderabad representation in CM Revanth Reddy’s current council of ministers, a win here could open the door for a new face in the cabinet. That has triggered intense lobbying from various castes and communities.Prominent among them are Muslim leaders, who argue that the bypoll gives the Congress a real chance to fulﬁl its social justice plank.“There’s not a single Muslim minister in the cabinet, despite our community making up 12.5% of the population,” said a senior minority leader. “Fielding a Muslim candidate here will show the party means what it says—jitni aabadi, utna haq (proportionate representation). Otherwise, the community may drift back to the BRS,” he opined.TPCC working president and former cricketer Mohammad Azharuddin, who lost from Jubilee Hills in 2023, is seeking a second shot. “I never left the constituency and have even ﬁled a case on EVM irregularities,” Azharuddin said. “My entire polling booth network is intact and active,” he claimed.Other contenders from the minority community include former minister and current advisor Mohd Ali Shabbir, Faheem Qureshi of the Telangana Minor-ities Residential Schools Society, Wakf Board chairman Syed Azmathullah Husseini, Indian Overseas Congress vice-president Numan Mohammed, and Feroz Khan, who narrowly lost from Nampally to AIMIM.From the non-minority side, Khairatabad DCC president and Revanth Reddy loyalist C Rohin Reddy is in the fray. A last-minute seat shift saw him lose from Amberpet in 2023, after ceding Khairatabad to Vijaya Reddy, daughter of former minister P Janardhan Reddy, who is also reportedly eyeing Jubilee Hills. Another contender is Navin Yadav, who has previously contested from this constituency under different banners.A Congress leader conﬁrmed that the high command will take time but ﬁnalise the candidate at least two months before the poll notiﬁcation. With each party reading Jubilee Hills as a political signal to the rest of Hyderabad, this bypoll will shape up to be much more than just a routine contest, a political observer said.","The Jubilee Hills by-election is a prestige contest for all three major parties: Congress, BRS, and BJP.
