'Faced years of systematic humiliation, harassment'

CHANDIGARH: IAS officer Amneet P Kumar, wife of senior Haryana IPS officer Y Puran Kumar who allegedly shot himself dead on Tuesday, lodged a complaint with Chandigarh police on Wednesday night seeking an FIR against Haryana DGP Shatrujeet Singh Kapur and Rohtak SP Narendra Bijarnia, and demanded their arrest.Amneet sought an FIR under BNS Section 108 (abetment to suicide) and provisions of the SC & ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. ""This is not a case of ordinary suicide but the direct result of systematic persecution of an honest officer from a Scheduled Caste community by powerful superiors,"" the IAS officer claimed in a complaint lodged at 8.55 pm on Wednesday.""Justice must not only be done but must be seen to be done - even for families like ours, shattered by the cruelty of the powerful,"" her complaint said.With a heart weighed by unspeakable grief and shaken faith in justice"", the IAS officer said that her husband, an officer of ""unimpeachable integrity and extraordinary public spirit"", faced ""years of systematic humiliation, harassment, and persecution"" by senior officers, and, she alleged, particularly by DGP Kapur.TOI contacted DGP Kapur for his response, but his office was yet to respond.SP Bijarnia told TOI, ""Rohtak police neither named him (Kumar) as an accused nor summoned him for any investigation. The FIR registered by Rohtak police on extortion charges against a police officer is based on strong evidence and facts. Regarding the complaint against me, the matter is being probed by Chandigarh police, and I have full faith in their investigation as they are fully competent to conduct a fair probe. ""Amneet claimed that her husband had informed her that ""a conspiracy was being hatched under the direction of DGP Kapur to falsely frame him in a frivolous complaint"".She specifically mentions a ""false FIR"" (No. 0319/2025) registered on Oct 6 at Rohtak's Urban Estate police station against one of her husband's former staff members. She alleged it was an attempt to implicate Puran Kumar in that case. ""This systematic persecution pushed him to his final anguish,"" the complaint read.She also said before his death, her husband had attempted to contact DGP Kapur and SP Bijarnia but received no response. The DGP ""brushed aside"" his plea and the SP ""intentionally did not respond"" to his call, she said. ""From the circumstances, it is evident SP Rohtak Narendra Bijarnia was acting in concert with DGP Kapur,""she alleged.Amneet alleged that her husband had repeatedly complained of caste-based discrimination, exclusion from police premises' places of worship, and humiliation over his SC background. ""He repeatedly invoked protection of the SC/ST Act, but was ignored,"" Amneet wrote, adding that ""administrative persecution can drive a person to suicide"".""The eight-page suicide note, a document of a broken spirit, reveals the names of several officers whose relentless actions drove him to the edge... It is impossible to express what my children and I have lost - a husband, a father, a man whose only crime was honesty in service. As an officer of the law, I now place my faith in the same institutions my husband and I served,"" says the emotionally charged complaint addressed to SHO, Sector-11. The IAS officer urged police to arrest the DGP and the SP, fearing t their positions of power could enable them to tamper with evidence and influence witnesses. Her complaint mentions that a suicide note was recovered by police and CFSL experts on the day of the incident.","Y Puran Kumar, Haryana's ADGP, allegedly shot himself dead on Tuesday.

"IPS officer suicide case: No autopsy yet, mystery over 'final note'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ips-officer-suicide-case-no-autopsy-yet-mystery-over-final-note/articleshow/124402058.cms,"File photo

CHANDIGARH: The mystery over Haryana ADG Y Puran Kumar’s suicide lingered on Wednesday as the postmortem was deferred and rumours swirled around amid police’s silence on the contents of the nine-page ‘final note’ left behind by the IPS officer.Kumar’s wife, IAS officer Amneet P Kumar, arrived in Chandigarh in the afternoon after cutting short her Japan trip as a member of CM Nayab Singh Saini’s delegation. She went to her official residence in sector 24 for a while. At 3pm, she left for the sector 11 house where Kumar allegedly shot himself with his gunman’s service revolver. From there, she headed for the mortuary in the sector 16 govt hospital where the IPS officer’s body awaits an autopsy.All this while, Amneet maintained distance from the media. When attempts were made to talk to her, she walked away with folded hands and in tears. In the hospital, she told officials present that she would “get justice at any cost”. She demanded a complete probe and told officials that she would not back down from any step to get justice, sources said.Officers said Amneet did not agree to the postmortem on Wednesday, and the autopsy, as well as last rites, will be conducted only after the couple’s elder daughter returns from the US on Oct 9.A police officer said Kumar had named at least seven serving and retired IPS officers in his final note, alleging that some seniors spoiled his ACR report and he faced unnecessary hurdles in promotion. He, however, did not name anyone specifically as the reason for his suicide, said sources, though he alleged that he was continuously harassed by officers of his own department. The note also spoke of his “stressful transfers” and “demeaning attitudes towards him” in social and professional environments.","Y Puran Kumar's wife, IAS officer Amneet P Kumar, arrived in Chandigarh in the afternoon after cutting short her Japan trip as a member of CM Nayab Singh Saini’s delegation.
