We can be political rivals and opponents but indulging in such dirty talk and using such a language is in bad taste,"" Naqvi told PTI when asked about Bittu's remarks targeting Gandhi.""Those who talk like this, it is injurious to their political health. The BJP's culture of politeness is its USP and must be adhered to by all,"" he said, without taking anyone's name.Union minister Bittu on Sunday hit out at Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi a day earlier calling him the ""number one terrorist"" and enemy of India. He was targeting the Congress leader over his remarks on Sikhs community while on a visit to the United States.""I think he doesn't love his country much because he goes abroad and says negative things about India. I think he is not a Hindustani,"" the minister said.He alleged that now Gandhi has got support from the separatists, who always talk about dividing the country. The separatists and the most-wanted persons are also appreciating Gandhi for his remarks against Sikhs, he said.""When such people, who are also experts in manufacturing bombs, are supporting Rahul Gandhi, then he is the number one terrorist of the country. He is talking like a separatist. There should be a reward for catching him as he is the biggest enemy of the country,"" he added.Earlier, during his visit to the United States, Rahul Gandhi stirred a political storm with his remarks on Sikhs in India.""First of all, you have to understand what the fight is about. The fight is not about politics. It is superficial. What is your name? The fight is about whether... he, as a Sikh, is going to be allowed to wear his turban in India. Or he, as a Sikh, is going to be allowed to wear a kada in India. Or a Sikh is going to be able to go to Gurdwara. That's what the fight is about and not just for him, for all religions,"" Rahul had said at an event in Virginia.Bittu's controversial reaction on Sunday, however, was met with criticism by the Congress.Leader of opposition in Punjab, Partap Singh Bajwa condemned Bittu's remarks saying it was deeply concerning that a minister, who drew a salary funded by taxpayers, failed to comprehend the constitutional values he is sworn to uphold.""His derogatory remarks demonstrate not only a profound lack of education and understanding of parliamentary principles but also an appalling disregard for responsible public conduct,"" he said.Congress leader Sandeep Dikshit also slammed the Union Minister over his controversial remarks and said that his political career in the Congress was also a mess.""We can only pity such people. His political career in Congress was also a mess. He used to praise Rahul Gandhi, and now, after resigning from Congress and joining the BJP, he is showing his loyalty to the BJP party,"" Dixit said.Congress leader Tariq Anwar said, ""Ravneet Bittu has just joined the BJP from the Congress party and he wants to prove that he follows the ideology of BJP and is anti-Rahul Gandhi.

"In PDP's battle for survival, south Kashmir holds the key",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-pdps-battle-for-survival-south-kashmir-holds-the-key/articleshow/113407686.cms,"ANANTNAG: In the rough and tumble of the post-Article 370 elections, Kashmir is seeing the invisible hand of ""Delhi"" behind everything, from the deluge of independent candidates to the surfeit of new parties pitching a hardline. And on the back foot is PDP , which tied up with BJP that opened the floodgates.The Kashmir contest will decide the fate of PDP, which, in its 25th year of existence, is in a battle of survival.Voting in south Kashmir in the first phase, the stronghold of PDP, will set the tone. It is significant that Mehbooba Mufti , who lost the Lok Sabha election to NC from Anantnag, has opted out of the assembly polls and is instead campaigning with gusto to ensure the party stays afloat. In her place, debutant daughter Iltija Mufti has become the third generation of Mufti clan to join electoral politics, and is in a keen fight from family borough Bijbehara.Mohd Ibrahim in Dooru-Shahbad echoed the many political analysts by remarking, ""PDP knows it is fighting against serious odds.""All regional parties of Kashmir have had a dalliance with BJP after it came to power in Delhi in 1998. But the benign face of Vajpayee and BJP's lack of ambition in Kashmir region did not roil the politics. In contrast, the aggression of PM Modi's BJP, which took away special status for J&K and downgraded it to a UT, is raising suspicions about Independents or new parties like Engineer Rashid 's AIP, Ghulam Nabi Azad 's DPAP or Apni Party.For PDP, this ubiquitous search for the ""Delhi hand"" has proved a nightmare scenario because it struck an alliance with BJP in 2015 and brought it to power in the state. Some believe PDP would have breezed past its earlier partnership with BJP, especially since the latter broke the tieup in 2018. But Centre's 2019 decision on Article 370 and the subsequent clampdown renewed the glare on PDP, in retrospect.The party appears alone, facing fire from all sides. While Engineer Rashid, who won the LS election in Baramulla from prison defeating NC's Omar Abdullah and who has presented himself as the ""untainted"" one, is targetting PDP and NC, in a cold blooded move distanced itself from the Mufti outfit after aligning with it as part of the 'Gupkar alliance' created as the resistance bloc in the post-370 scenario. Besides, this year, the banned Jamaat-e-Islami is fighting elections after three decades by supporting Independents and Rashid's candidates, and even fielding its own Independents. The direct loser of the Jamaat move could be PDP which was boosted by Jamaat support for years.Seats across Anantnag, Kulgam, Shopian and Pulwama will decide if PDP has a future in an increasingly competitive turf. Recently, Mehbooba tugged emotional chords by praising the people for changing the ""two party"" political culture, referring to PDP's founding in 1999.","The Kashmir contest will decide the fate of PDP, which, in its 25th year of existence, is in a battle of survival.

NEW DELHI: In a first, Enforcement Directorate has initiated an investigation under the stringent Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against illegal infiltration of Bangladeshis and Rohingya in Jharkhand, reported.The enforcement agency's ECIR (enforcement case information report) under PMLA is based on an FIR of Ranchi police (registered at Bariyatu PS on June 6) but it will look into the larger conspiracy, including the gains from infiltration being deployed into politics.The decision of the enforcement agency - primarily tasked to administer the anti-money laundering regime and violations of FEMA - coincides with alleged infiltration from Bangladesh emerging as one of the key issues in the campaign for Jharkhand polls.Speaking at a Jamshedpur rally in poll-bound Jharkhand on Sunday, PM Modi had blamed the coalition of JMM, Congress and RJD for change of demography in Santhal Parganas and Kolhan by allegedly facilitating infiltration of Rohingya and Bangladeshis. Jharkhand police 's FIR is related to trafficking of six girls from Bangladesh to Jharkhand. The girls, Rohingya and Bangladeshis in their 20s, were nabbed during a raid by police. Subsequent investigation showed they had obtained identity papers and Aadhaar cards in Hindu names based on fake documents arranged by agents from Kolkata.The agency has already gathered details from other central agencies related to the operation of the syndicate engaged in trafficking Bangladeshis and Rohingya through forests in Jharkhand. A well organised network operating out of Kolkata is engaged in forging documents to help the alleged infiltrators pass themselves off as Indians from Bengal, sources said.""A large syndicate is operating across Jharkhand and Bengal in illegal infiltration, making fake identity proof, which are criminal activities linked to proceeds of crime under Section 2(1)(u) of PMLA,"" a source said, adding it was necessary to investigate illegal infiltration from Bangladesh and the agents facilitating such activities, which are aimed at acquiring proceeds of crime. The agency will conduct an exhaustive money trail probe of the entire trafficking network.CM Hemant Soren's assembly constituency, Barhait in Sahibganj, is part of the region where the number of alleged Bangladeshis and Rohingya has increased. Blaming it on vote-bank politics, Modi said, ""JMM, Congress and RJD are standing with Rohingya and Bangladeshi immigrants . They want to create votebanks in the name of religion. We must stop this right away.

""The pain that I am feeling is also in Manish Sisodia 's mind.The things that were said about me were also said about him. Manish has said that he will take over the post of deputy CM and education minister of Delhi only when the people of Delhi say that he is honest,"" said Kejriwal in his speech at the party office on Sunday.Atishi's rise in the party has been meteoric. Party functionaries are pointing out that her importance was evident when Kejriwal sent a message from jail proposing that Atishi would hoist the national flag on his behalf at Delhi govt's Independence Day function. However, lieutenant governor V K Saxena nominated minister Kailash Gahlot for the job.Atishi's responsibilities include finance, planning, PWD, water, power, education, higher education, services and publicity. Since the party's formation, she has made substantial contributions to its expansion and progress. She played a critical role as a key member of the manifesto drafting committee for the 2013 assembly elections and was instrumental in formulating the party's objectives and vision.As the MLA representing Kalkaji assembly constituency, Atishi has been at the vanguard of the party's communication efforts and has taken the lead in addressing critical issues such as the Delhi water dispute with neighbouring states. She has been vocal on day-to-day party affairs and in taking on BJP and LG.The name of Kejriwal's wife, Sunita Kejriwal , is also being discussed. Speculation about her future role in the party and govt has been gaining ground because of her increasing appearances in public and political platforms. She was constantly by Kejriwal's side when he came out of jail on interim bail and campaigned for the Lok Sabha elections. Party sources are ruling her out as a candidate just as Kejriwal too has been playing down her role in the past.The party and Kejriwal must be aware that if Sunita Kejriwal, a 1993-batch Indian Revenue Services officer, occupies the hot seat, it will give BJP ready ammunition to target AAP on nepotism.Non-controversial Delhi party convenor and minister Gopal Rai , who has been with the party since the time of Anna Hazare's agitation and is a Poorvanchali, could also be a safe choice for keeping the chair warm.The name of health minister Saurabh Bharadwaj , a popular MLA who has been very vocal on party and govt affairs and in taking on BJP and LG, has also cropped up among other names.Besides these prominent names, a section of the party speculated that it might consider a scheduled caste candidate, such as Rakhi Birla , deputy speaker in the assembly, in order to send a signal.","Atishi's responsibilities include finance, planning, PWD, water, power, education, higher education, services and publicity.
