NAVI MUMBAI: A young couple who were caught on camera having sex in the back row of a fairly empty civic-run AC bus in Navi Mumbai last month were recently traced and fined Rs 2,000 each by a local court.They expressed remorse in court. The video had prompted the civic body to suspend the bus conductor for not being alert and failing to take action against the couple. He was later reinstated.The clip was shot by a motorist who spotted the couple—a delivery agent and a medical laboratory assistant—from a window of the bus. The conductor was said to have been seated in the front, along with a few passengers, and, therefore, didn't spot them.After Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation's transport wing filed a complaint at Kamothe police station, an FIR was lodged under Section 296 of BNS and Sections 110 and 117 of Maharashtra Police Act for obscenity in public and the couple were traced based on the video, said police inspector Prashant Tayade.","Couple caught on camera having sex in the back row of a civic-run AC bus in Navi Mumbai last month.
