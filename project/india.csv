Poll Do you believe that stricter regulations should be enforced for school bus drivers? Yes, definitely No, current regulations are sufficient





BENGALURU: A routine ride home from school turned into a heart-wrenching tragedy for the family of a seven-year-old boy, who died after falling out of a moving school bus due to the negligence of the driver in Magadi Friday evening.The victim is L Rajat, a class 2 student at SBS School in Magadi Town and a resident of Hosapalya in Janata Colony. He is the son of Lokesh and Radha, both daily wage workers from Hanur in Kollegal. Rajat was returning home along with his 10-year-old sister Dushita in the school bus when the incident occurred.Reconstructing the sequence of events, police the brother-sister get picked and dropped off every day by the school bus driven by 35-year-old R Vinod. ""Usually, around 30 children use the school bus. A woman attendant is appointed to look after the children during the journey. Rajat and Dushita board the bus first as the bus service starts near their house. During drop off, the brother-sister duo are the last ones to deboard,"" an investigating officer said.On Friday evening, all kids got dropped and the woman attendant got off a stop before that of Rajat and Dushita.""Vinod resumed the journey with Rajat and Dushita seated near the door. The door opened as it was not properly locked. Vinod asked Rajat to close the door. As Rajat moved closer to the door, he got thrown out of the vehicle and the rear tyre ran over him,"" police said.Vinod immediately took Rajat to a nearby private hospital, but the child succumbed to his injuries, police said. The police arrested Vinod for culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Normally, persons accused of causing accidental deaths are arrested for causing death due to negligence, and the accused person can walk out on station bail. However, when booked for culpable homicide not amounting to murder, the police have to produce the accused before the concerned court, which normally hands them over to judicial custody.""Vinod's responsibility was to ensure that the door was properly locked. He didn't check it. The second mistake was asking Rajat to close the door while the bus was moving. Vinod has been shifted to the judicial custody of Ramanagara district prison,"" an investigating officer said.","L Rajat, 7, died after falling out of a moving school bus due to the negligence of the driver.

‘Na Bijli Aayegi Na Bill’: BJP Minister’s Dig Becomes Self-Goal in Bihar | Free Electricity

NEW DELHI: On the birthday of Nishant Kumar , son of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar , Rashtriya Lok Samta Party and Rajya Sabha MP Upendra Kushwaha sparked a political buzz by publicly suggesting it’s time for a leadership transition within the party.Taking to social media, Kushwaha, an NDA ally, extended warm wishes to Nishant and called him the ""new hope"" of Janata Dal (U). “On this happy occasion, I respectfully urge Nitish ji to acknowledge the reality that managing both the government and the party may no longer be ideal for him,” he wrote.While praising Kumar’s long administrative experience and his importance in running the state, Kushwaha appealed to him to consider handing over party responsibilities—something he claimed many in the party also believe is long overdue. “Delaying this could lead to damage that may never be repaired,” he warned.Without directly naming health or age, Kushwaha’s remarks echoed ongoing chatter about Nitish Kumar’s physical and mental capacity to continue in full leadership roles.Kushwaha added that many JDU leaders may not have the access or courage to convey such concerns directly to Nitish Kumar, which is why he felt compelled to say it openly.Interestingly, when asked about his political debut during a temple visit in Patna on Sunday, Nitish's son, Nishant Kumar, denied any plans to enter politics. Instead, he urged the people of Bihar to once again make his father the chief minister.",Nishant Kumar is the son of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar.

Hundreds gather for Fauja’s final journey,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hundreds-gather-for-faujas-final-journey/articleshow/122801618.cms,"Hundreds gather for Fauja’s final journey

JALANDHAR: A marathon’s starting gun often got Fauja Singh going. Guns went off on Sunday too, those of Punjab police at a funeral with full state honours for the 114-year-old whose never-say-die spirit was cut short by an SUV’s fatal knock last week.Hundreds of admirers, locals and luminaries descended on Fauja’s native village of Beas near Jalandhar as sons Sukhjinder Singh and Harvinder Singh lit the pyre. The VIPs included governor Gulab Chand Kataria, chief minister Bhagwant Mann and other politicians across party lines. Fauja’s body was placed in a glass casket earlier in the day, allowing many to pay their final respects. It was later carried in a hearse to the village cremation ground where a Punjab police contingent offered a ceremonial gun salute.In a message to Harvinder, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the “extraordinary” Fauja’s passing had left a void “that can never be filled”. “Fauja Singh Ji became the first centenarian to complete the marathon successfully. That he took up long-distance running at a very advanced age speaks volumes not only for his physical fitness but, more importantly, his mental strength and resilience,” Prime Minister Modi wrote in his message.Governor Kataria echoed the theme, calling Fauja a global inspiration as he recalled walking with him during an anti-drugs campaign only a few months ago.“His stamina and spirit were unmatched,” Kataria said.Mann announced that the local govt school would be renamed in Fauja’s honour and his statue installed at the village stadium and a sports college in Jalandhar. “He brought international recognition not only to Punjab but also to the Sikh community,” the chief minister said.The centenarian athlete died on July 14 after being struck by a speeding SUV as he was crossing a highway near Beas on way to a roadside eatery named after his late son, Kuldeep. Amritpal Singh Dhillon, 26, a Canada-based NRI visiting nearby Dasupur village, was later arrested on charges of culpable homicide and rash driving.","Fauja Singh's sons Sukhjinder Singh and Harvinder Singh lit the pyre.

Road fatalities in 2022

NEW DELHI: The Punjab Police catching the driver involved in marathon runner Fauja Singh’s death case within days has kicked off a debate why police across states can’t nab absconding drivers, instead classifying these cases as “hit and run” and making no headway in them. Analysis of the NCRB data of 2022 (the latest published report) show that in 125 police districts, 100% of all deaths due to “negligence relating to road accidents” causing deaths were put under the “hit and run” category.This trend was across most of the states and UTs, including two police districts in Delhi, NCR cities of Ghaziabad and Meerut, Dehradun, Nainital, Mathura, Agra, Gwalior, Ujjain, Jodhpur, Bokaro, Jalandhar Rural and Nagpur police commissionerate, raising questions over the quality of data and reports that police put in file in case of road accidents.Traffic safety experts and former senior police officers told TOI that it’s high time govt reviews how data in road crashes and deaths are collected and their sanctity. “It’s simply not possible that all deaths due to negligent driving are hit and run cases. In almost all states it’s the junior most person officially records road accidents and writes the FIR. The mechanism to audit the data before sending to the NCRB or publishing is weak.Such reports hardly serve any purpose,” said a former senior Delhi police officer.On the most probable reason for recording most cases as hit and run, an expert said once such a case is registered and concluded weeks after the incident, police hardly carry out an investigation.He added that in several cases, both parties also reach a compromise and the victims’ kin get the compensation from govt rather than pursuing the case.The data published by National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) show that nearly 85% of all 384 road deaths due to negligence (section 304A of earlier IPC) in Uttarakhand were recorded as hit and run. In the case of Uttar Pradesh, this was recorded as the reason in 16,343 road fatalities out of 20,109 death cases that police registered under earlier IPC section. Out of its 78 police districts, 47 had reported all road fatalities under hit and run.It was no different even in the case of Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand where more than 55% of road deaths registered under 304A of IPC were due to negligent driving. While in MP, 15 police districts had all deaths registered under hit and run, in the case of Jharkhand there were eight such police districts. However, there were some exceptions as well. States such as Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Kerala Andhra Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal where no police district recorded all road crash deaths as hit and run cases, as per NCRB.","Punjab Police catching the driver involved in marathon runner Fauja Singh’s death case within days has kicked off a debate why police across states can’t nab absconding drivers.

NEW DELHI: A case of sexual assault has been registered against Pratik Chauhan, son of BJP MLA Prabhu Chauhan, following allegations that he repeatedly raped a 25-year-old woman from Maharashtra after promising to marry her.The complaint was lodged at the Bidar Women’s Police Station in Karnataka on Sunday.According to FIR, Chauhan allegedly began a relationship with the woman two years ago and later assured her that he would marry her.Based on this promise, she says she travelled with him to various locations and was sexually assaulted multiple times between December 2023 and March 2024.The woman alleges the first assault took place in a Bengaluru hotel room in September 2023.A formal engagement ceremony was held on 25 December 2023 at Chauhan’s family residence in Ghamsubai Bonthi Tanda in Aurad taluk, Bidar, in the presence of both families.Despite this, the victim says her repeated requests — and those of her family — to fix a wedding date were ignored. Instead, she claims she was lured on trips to Latur and Shirdi under the guise of religious visits, during which she was sexually assaulted again.In a particularly disturbing allegation, the complaint says Chauhan once coerced her to prove her love by self-harming.When she hesitated, he allegedly used a blade to inflict a deep cut on her forearm. The injury was treated at a hospital in Udgir.On 5 July 2025, when the woman’s family visited the accused's residence to press for a wedding date, they were allegedly told by Chauhan and his father to “do whatever they wanted”, according to the complaint.Police say a case has been registered and further investigation is under way.

DEHRADUN: Garhwali folk singer Pawan Semwal is facing charges of ""promoting enmity and insulting the modesty of women"" over a song that was purportedly targeting the Uttarakhand govt led by CM Pushkar Singh Dhami on issues of rising unemployment and crimes against women.Dehradun resident Manju Lal filed a complaint on Saturday, alleging that a line in the song -- which links rise in the number of liquor shops to prostitution -- was offensive to all women in Uttarakhand. A case was filed later that night at Patel Nagar police station, and Semwal, who was in Delhi, was summoned for questioning on Sunday.Inspector Chandrabhan Singh Adhikari, SHO of Patel Nagar, said the case was filed under BNS sections 196 (promoting enmity between groups), 353 (statements conducive to public mischief), and 79 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of women). ""After questioning, he was served notice under BNSS section 35, under which he must present himself before police when summoned during the probe. He was also warned not to repeat such acts,"" Adhikari said.The song, titled 'Tin Bhi Ni Thami' in Garhwali, loosely translated as 'Can't handle it for a bit', had first been uploaded three days ago, and then taken down. It was re-uploaded on Saturday and deleted again after the police action.Despite attempts by TOI, both Semwal and complainant Lal could not be reached. However, in a video posted on social media while en route to Dehradun, Semwal said there had been ""immense pressure on him from the police to delete the song"" when it was first uploaded.The case has also triggered a political row in Uttarakhand.
