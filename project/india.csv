NEW DELHI: Delhi Police on Tuesday reportedly registered an FIR against the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) for allegedly posting AI-generated photos and videos of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and union home minister Amit Shah on the party's official X handle.According to PTI sources, the case was filed under relevant sections at the North Avenue police station on 'objectionable photos and videos' on AAP's official X handle. The alleged videos were posted by AAP on January 10 and January 13.One video, made using AI-deepfake technology, showed a scene from a 90s Bollywood film where the faces of villains were replaced with those of BJP leaders, and the audio was altered to discuss Delhi polls.After analyzing the complaint, an FIR was filed, and an investigation has been initiated, an officer said.The FIR said that the tweet was fabricated to mislead the public and tarnish the Prime Minister's office.AAP leaders have also been accused of making inflammatory statements against people from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh on January 9, 2025.The complaint alleges that their statements were discriminatory and intended to create tension between communities, violating provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita and the Representation of People Act.Meanwhile, a complaint was filed against AAP leader and Delhi chief minister Atishi for allegedly violating the Model Code of Conduct by using a government vehicle for political purpose.In response, the Aam Aadmi Party stated, ""False cases are being registered to divert attention from real issues concerning the people. Their next step is likely to target chief minister Atishi and Manish Sisodia with arrests and raids as part of their political vendetta.""""However, no FIR will be filed against BJP leaders who are blatantly involved in illegal activities like manipulating voter lists -- adding fake entries and deleting genuine voters - or those who are trying to buy votes by handing out cash and gifts,"" AAP added.The party claimed that this 'selective use of power and abuse of state machinery exposes BJP's fear of AAP's growing popularity and commitment to the public good.'",Delhi Police reportedly registered an FIR against the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) for allegedly posting AI-generated photos and videos of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah.
