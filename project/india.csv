"AAP disengages from INDIA bloc, says alliance was only for 2024 LS polls",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/aap-disengages-from-india-bloc-says-alliance-was-only-for-2024-ls-polls/articleshow/121605557.cms,"NEW DELHI: AAP on Tuesday disengaged itself from the INDIA bloc, saying the opposition grouping was formed only for the 2024 Lok sabha polls. It also alleged BJP and Congress had entered a “secret, corrupt deal”.The statement came as Congress and 15 other opposition parties wrote to PM Narendra Modi demanding a special session of Parliament on developments following the Pahalgam terror attack. AAP made the same demand separately.AAP national media in-charge Anurag Dhanda said on X , “The real alliance is between BJP and Congress behind the scenes. Rahul Gandhi says only that which benefits Modi politically. In return, Modi saves the Gandhi family from going to jail. Neither of them is interested in providing basic facilities like schools, hospitals, electricity and water to the countrymen.”“To clean Indian politics, we must end this behind-the-scenes collusion. Rahul Gandhi and Modi may appear as opponents on stage but the truth is that they’ve become guarantees of each other’s political survival. Congress’s weak politics empowers BJP, and BJP’s rule hides Congress’s corruption,” Dhanda alleged in a statement issued by the party later.Asserting that the INDIA bloc was formed specifically for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, Dhanda said, “The alliance ensured that opposition parties secured 240 seats – this is a significant achievement.” He drove home the point that the alliance as far as AAP had lived its purpose and the party was not part of the bloc anymore. “AAP will contest every state election on its own. We will be contesting all seats in Bihar later this year, “ Dhanda told TOI.“In Parliament, however, our MPs will support the opposition’s position based on what is best for the country and our MPs will vote accordingly in both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha,” Dhanda said.AAP and Congress have had a turbulent equation even as INDIA bloc partners. After much to and fro on seat sharing talks and much resistance to the alliance from the Congress’s Delhi unit, the two parties finally did fight as allies in Delhi and also in Gujarat and Haryana in the Lok Sabha polls but were pitted against each other in Punjab.Later last year, the two parties failed to reach a consensus on seat-sharing in the Haryana assembly polls and fought against each other. In the Delhi assembly elections earlier this year too both parties fought a bitter battle that had put a big question mark on how both AAP and Congress would carry off as allies in the INDIA bloc.","AAP national media in-charge Anurag Dhanda said on X, “The real alliance is between BJP and Congress behind the scenes” The statement came as Congress and 15 other opposition parties wrote to PM Narendra Modi demanding a special session of Parliament on developments following the Pahalgam terror attack.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121605697,imgsize-883581,width-400,resizemode-4/121605697.jpg"
Married woman can't accuse man of rape on promise of marriage: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/married-woman-cant-accuse-man-of-rape-on-promise-of-marriage-sc/articleshow/121607008.cms,"NEW DELHI: SC has ruled that a married woman cannot accuse a man of rape on promise of marriage while her own marriage is still subsisting, and quashed a rape case filed by her against a man.The case involved a Muslim woman, mother of a four-year-old, residing at her parents' home in Maharashtra's Satara. She developed a relationship with her 23-year-old neighbour, a BSc student.In her police complaint alleging rape on the promise of marriage, she claimed that the man maintained a physical relationship with her from June 8, 2022, to July 8, 2023, assuring her repeatedly that he would marry her after her divorce.

He moved SC, where a bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and Satish C Sharma found inconsistencies in the woman's narrative and conduct.""The complainant alleged the appellant had physical relations with her without consent. However, she not only sustained the relationship for a year but also visited him at lodges on two occasions.Her conduct does not corroborate her allegations,"" court said.The bench highlighted that the woman was still married during part of the relationship. Writing the judgment, Justice Sharma noted, ""Khulanama was executed on Dec 29, 2022. It is inconceivable she entered a physical relationship with the appellant on promise of marriage while still married. Such a promise was illegal & unenforceable.""The court observed that the complaint seemed to have been filed after the man graduated, returned to his hometown Ahmednagar, and a visit by the woman led to a confrontation with his family.Quashing the police cases, SC said, ""No reasonable possibility exists that a married woman with a four-year-old child would be continuously deceived or maintain a prolonged association with someone who sexually assaulted her. A consensual relationship turning sour cannot invoke state's criminal machinery.""","The case involved a Muslim woman, mother of a four-year-old, residing at her parents' home in Maharashtra's Satara.

"Bangladesh Supreme Court restores Jamaat's party registration, clears path to contest polls",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-supreme-court-restores-jamaats-party-registration-clears-path-to-contest-polls/articleshow/121557628.cms,"DHAKA:





Bangladesh's Supreme Court on Sunday ordered the Election Commission to restore the right-wing Jamaat-e-Islami's party registration, nearly eight months after the interim govt lifted a ban on it, clearing the way for its participation in future elections.Court officials said the SC's appellate division, led by chief justice Syed Refaat Ahmed, directed the commission to restore the party's registration.The apex court said it was up to EC to decide if Jamaat could contest polls using its traditional ""scale"" symbol.EC scrapped the registration of Jamaat, which was opposed to Bangladesh's 1971 independence from Pakistan, in Dec 2018 in line with a HC ruling. In 2013, SC cancelled the registration of the Jamaat-e-Islami, saying the party is unfit to contest national elections.Former PM Sheikh Hasina's govt slapped a total ban on the party days ahead of her ouster on Aug 5, 2024 in a violent mass movement led by a platform called Students against Discrimination (SAD).Jamaat and several other parties had backed SAD.After Hasina's ouster, the party appealed for a review of the 2013 court order banning it.""Today concludes the decade-long legal battle. We hope Bangladesh will have a vibrant parliament after this verdict. We hope voters will vote for the Jamaat candidate of their choice now,"" one of Jamaat's leading counsels Mohammad Shishir Manir said.","Bangladesh's Supreme Court orders the Election Commission to restore the right- wing Jamaat-e-Islami's party registration.
