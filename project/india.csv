Mumbai: The battle for Maharashtra's limited opposition seats intensified Thursday as Sena UBT's Aaditya Thackeray virtually staked his party's claim to the Maha Vikas Aghadi's lone winnable seats in the upcoming Rajya Sabha and legislative council polls.Pointing to the current strength of the assembly, Aaditya suggested the arithmetic favours his party over its MVA allies Congress and NCP (SP). In the 288-member Maharashtra assembly, Sena UBT has 20 legislators, followed by Congress (16) and NCP (SP) (10).""If you look at the figures, the (RS polls) seat belongs to Sena UBT, and talks will definitely happen in that direction in MVA,"" Aaditya said.EC is set to officially notify polls for seven Rajya Sabha seats, scheduled for March 16, on Feb 26. Among prominent members whose term is to expire is NCP (SP) chief Sharad Pawar. Pawar has already signalled his intent to seek re-election, according to Sena UBT's Sanjay Raut.RS members are elected by MLAs, and given the massive strength of the Mahayuti, it is likely to win six out of seven seats in Maharashtra in the upcoming polls.","Sena UBT's Aaditya Thackeray virtually staked his party's claim to the Maha Vikas Aghadi's lone winnable seats in the upcoming Rajya Sabha and legislative council polls.EC is set to officially notify polls for seven Rajy Sabha seats, scheduled for March 16, on Feb 26.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128582096,imgsize-22740,width-400,resizemode-4/aaditya-thackeray.jpg"

DK Shivakumar: Trash tussle erupts as trucks queue up; DK Shivakumar threatens to dump waste at BJP MLAs’ doorsteps,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/trash-tussle-erupts-as-trucks-queue-up-dks-threatens-to-dump-waste-at-bjp-mlas-doorsteps/articleshow/128520663.cms,"Bengaluru: Fatal Crashes & Killings, Daring Theft, Political Buzz & More





BENGALURU: A long queue of garbage trucks and auto-tippers lined the road to the Bellahalli landfill after being stopped from dumping waste, turning the stretch into a flashpoint of civic disruption. The impasse quickly snowballed into a political sparring match Wednesday, with the opposition BJP accusing the govt of mismanaging waste disposal and the Congress hitting back with counter-allegations.Opposition leader R Ashoka alleged that the city is on the brink of a sanitation crisis, with heaps of garbage lying uncleared across several localities.Deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar, who holds the Bengaluru development portfolio, hit back sharply, warning: ""We'll be forced to dump garbage in front of the houses of BJP MLAs who are obstructing garbage disposal.""His remarks followed speculation that BJP MLAs from Mahadevapura and Doddaballapur were backing a section of residents who had refused to allow waste to be dumped at Bellahalli until funds for road development were released.Ashoka said the city was reeling under mounting waste, with garbage piling up across several areas. ""For the last three days, the Outer Ring Road has been lined with heaps of garbage. Compactors and auto-tippers are standing in queues.The Congress is not handling the issue properly, and contractors have not been paid,"" he alleged.""If this continues for two more days, Bengaluru will turn into a garbage city. Congress will be responsible for giving it that title,"" he said, urging the govt to immediately release pending funds and clear the accumulated waste.Shivakumar, while pointing out the landfills were located in constituencies represented by BJP MLAs, charged the BJP with obstructing essential civic services and attempting to ""blackmail"" the govt by preventing garbage trucks from entering designated dumping sites. While directing the elected representatives to behave properly, he asked: ""If they keep opposing disposal in their constituency, where do we dispose it? We will have to send to the homes of Ashoka and BY Vijayendra (state BJP president). "" If the problem continues, the govt will initiate action under the Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA), he warned.On allegations of accidents involving garbage trucks, Shivakumar acknowledged lapses. ""If an accident took place, legal action will follow. The accident should not have happened, but it occurred. However, stopping garbage trucks in this backdrop is not correct,"" he said.The DCM added that from Thursday morning, trucks will be directed to dumping sites in the constituencies of MLA ST Somashekar and minister Krishna Byre Gowda in Bengaluru, noting that the process was not new and was followed earlier as well.He said the govt purchased two locations for waste dumping and called for tenders in accordance with the law, adding that certain legal issues were being addressed.","Opposition leader R Ashoka alleges that the city is on the brink of a sanitation crisis.
