EC: Will accept Bihar roll claims even after September 1,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ec-will-accept-bihar-roll-claims-even-after-september-1/articleshow/123644380.cms,"Bihar SIR: SC Slams Political Parties’ Silence, Directs Poll Panel To Accept Aadhaar Or 11 Documents

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday did not extend the Sept 1 deadline for filing claims and objections to Bihar Draft Voters List prepared after special intensive revision (SIR) as the Election Commission said such submissions can be made by people till the last date of nominations for the Assembly elections.""Most importantly, the filing of claims or objections or corrections is not barred after Sept 1. These can be submitted even after the deadline. The applications submitted for claims, objections or corrections after Sept 1 will be considered after the electoral roll has been finalised,"" Election Commission told a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi, while arguing that extension of deadline would create complications.For EC, senior advocates Rakesh Dwivedi and Maninder Singh said, ""The process of consideration of claims and objections continues until the last date of filing of nominations, and all inclusions and exclusions are integrated in the final roll.""After the recording of EC's statement, the bench expressed surprise that despite several SC directives to political parties which protested SIR, only 128 claims and objections were filed: 10 by RJD for inclusion, and 118 by CPI(ML) Liberation (103 challenging inclusion and rest for inclusion).""What is bothering us is that despite all these directions passed by the Supreme Court, the political parties have come out with only 128 claims and objections. The booth level agents (BLAs) are grassroots-level party workers. Why are BLAs not coming out with lists of people allegedly excluded from the draft voter list? And what is more surprising is that political parties are filing more applications for deletion rather than inclusion,"" the bench said.Finding that the political parties are not assisting those among the 65-lakh people deleted from the voter list to file claims, the bench directed the state legal services authority to instruct by Tuesday noon its district units to activate para-legal volunteers and assist people in getting enrolled.EC, as per its records, said, ""Approximately 99.5% of the electors (out of 7.24 crore) featured in the draft electoral roll for the state of Bihar have already submitted their eligibility documents pertaining to the SIR exercise.""Importantly, the bench asked the district legal services authorities (DLSAs) to send a confidential report on the issues faced by people in inclusion, correction or deletion of their names from the voter list. It posted the matter for further hearing on Sept 8.EC told the apex court that, in contrast with political parties, individual electors have been more alert and proactive, having submitted 33,326 forms for inclusion in the draft roll and 2,07,565 forms for deletion.EC said extension of the deadline would disrupt the schedule for finalisation of electoral roll. ""The Sept 1-30 period is fixed for considering claims and objections and involves consideration of issuing notices and responses to doubtful cases,"" it said.",The Supreme Court on Monday did not extend the Sept 1 deadline for filing claims and objections to Bihar Draft Voters List. Election Commission said such submissions can be made by people till the last date of nominations for the Assembly elections.

BJP Raises Objection Over Alleged Abuses At Congress Rally Against PM Modi's Mother





What's next?



NEW DELHI: For 16 days, Rahul Gandhi’s 'Voter Adhikar Yatra' carved a noisy trail through Bihar ’s dusty highways and crowded colonies. More than a campaign, it was pitched as a ""moral"" crusade: a fight to ""protect the vote"" of millions allegedly struck off the rolls. The march had political theatrics, constitutional sermons, and opposition show of force - adding to both hope and controversy.Over 1,300 km, across 25 of 38 districts and 110 assembly constituencies, Rahul Gandhi walked, rode bikes, and waved his way through Bihar's politically charged landscape. From Sasaram to Patna, the yatra drew vast crowds, with slogans like 'Vote Chor, Gaddi Chhor' echoing throughout.INDIA bloc allies joined at different stages, turning the yatra into a a portrait of opposition unity.At its core, the campaign was about a single phrase 'vote theft.' Rahul Gandhi accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Election Commission of disenfranchising more than 65 lakh voters, disproportionately Dalits, OBCs, Muslims, and the poor, through the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls.""This is not just about Bihar, it is about India's democracy,"" he declared at multiple stops, equating the march with a defence of the Constitution itself.While Congress has long been a marginal force in Bihar, this yatra has pushed Rahul Gandhi into the role of lead protagonist in the opposition drama, rather than a supporting character.Though Congress has long been a minor player in Bihar politics, the yatra has also revived its cadre, giving local workers visibility and provided the party a chance to reset its organisational machinery months before Bihar assembly elections By framing the battle as one of rights and democracy, rather than caste politics alone, Congress seeks to leapfrog back into Bihar's political relevance. The yatra has also sharpened opposition attacks on the EC, ensuring the issue will reverberate in coming elections.The finale in Patna on Monday tied the campaign's rhetoric to history. Marching from Gandhi Maidan to Ambedkar’s statue, Rahul Gandhi invoked both leaders’ legacies, casting the yatra as a ""revolution for electoral justice.""Visuals of him in white T-shirt and local gamcha, riding jeeps and chatting with villagers, were circulated widely on social media by the party - crafted as proof of a grounded, accessible leader. Congress leader also stepped into knee-deep waters to see how makhana (fox nuts) - world's new favourite superfood from Bihar - is grown. Sharing a video of his interaction, Rahul said the entire hard work is done by 99 per cent 'Bahujans' while the benefit goes to only 1 per cent middlemen, as he vowed to fight this ""injustice"".But the road was not without bumps. A police constable injured in Rahul Gandhi’s convoy became a flashpoint for BJP attacks. Meanwhile, alleged abusive remarks against PM Modi during a rally in Darbhanga drew sharp and coordinated criticism from the BJP.Both party workers also clashes in Patna over the remarks escalating political tensions.The yatra has undeniably energised Congress’s rank and file, repositioned Rahul Gandhi as a rights-focused challenger to PM Modi, and sent a message of opposition unity in a state where caste politics usually dominates. But the unanswered question remains: will this momentum last, or will it fade like previous Congress spurts?For now, Rahul Gandhi leaves Bihar having turned ""vote theft"" into a political battle cry and hoping his yatra is remembered less as a roadshow, and more as the beginning of a movement that translates into results in upcoming elections.","Rahul Gandhi’s 'Voter Adhikar Yatra' carved a noisy trail through Bihar ’s dusty highways and crowded colonies.

NEW DELHI: Former vice-president Jagdeep Dhankhar on Monday vacated VP Enclave, almost six weeks after his unexpected resignation from the second highest constitutional post. Dhankhar has shifted to a farmhouse at Gadaipur in south Delhi's Chhatarpur, which belongs to INLD chief Abhay Chautala , in what is supposed to be an encampment before he gets an official bungalow.Videos showed Dhankhar, the first occupant of the Enclave, leaving the sprawling complex in the evening, accompanied by a cavalcade of cars, police escort vehicles, and an ambulance.Chautala said on X that he had offered his place to the ex-VP because of their old family links. ""We have old family ties with him. He is like a family member. When I asked him where he was shifting, he said he was thinking about it. I told him it (my farmhouse) is his house. Till the new official accommodation is allotted and ready, he can stay in our house,"" the INLD chief said.A few days ago, INLD leader Abhay Chautala had told mediapersons in Haryana that he was confident of Jagdeep Dhankhar soon speaking about why he resigned from the VP post while asserting that he had spoken to the former VP.Sources said the VP Enclave will be made ready for Dhankhar's successor in the next 10 days. The VP election will be held on Sept 9 and NDA's candidate C P Radhakrishnan is the favourite. TOI has learnt that so far there has been no movement to identify any retirement home for Dhankhar, with sources saying that the housing & urban affairs ministry would begin shortlisting available type-VIII bungalows in the Lutyens' Bungalow Zone after getting a communication from MHA. ""That process will take some time as after identifying bungalows, there will be some renovation and other works,"" said a source.Meanwhile, govt functionaries whom Dhankhar had selected to be attached to him have raised eyebrows in govt quarters by putting in requests for residential accommodation in Delhi. Sources said that usually such requests are routed through the proper channel.Dhankhar shared close ties with former deputy PM Devi Lal and his son, the ex-chief minister of Haryana Om Prakash Chautala. Though the former VP crossed over to Congress and, later, joined BJP, he had attended O P Chautala's last rites in Khera village of Sirsa district.Dhankhar got the Central Public Works Department to add many features, including a swimming pool, to the VP Enclave. The privileges will now be availed of by his successor, who will get a full five-year term.",Jagdeep Dhankhar has shifted to a farmhouse at Gadaipur in south Delhi's Chhatarpur.

Congress MP Tagore writes to PM seeking review of clearances for Great Nicobar Project,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-mp-tagore-writes-to-pm-seeking-review-of-clearances-for-great-nicobar-project/articleshow/123639385.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amid continuing uproar over the Great Nicobar Project, Congress MP Manickam Tagore on Monday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking his urgent intervention to protect the constitutional and legal rights of the Nicobarese tribes that are “threatened” by the Rs 72,000-crore infrastructure scheme. He urged the PM to direct the Union ministries of tribal affairs, and environment and forests, to conduct an independent review of the process followed to grant forest clearances and divert forest land in Nicobar.In his letter, Tagore said the Andaman and Nicobar administration has wrongly claimed that Forest Rights Act (FRA) rights were “identified and settled” before forest clearances were granted for diversion of 13,075 hectares of forest land. He said the Tribal Council of Great Nicobar has categorically rejected the administration’s claim and dubbed the assertion a direct violation of FRA, 2006.The Congress MP urged Modi to suspend the project till laws are complied with, and to ensure that forest rights of the tribal communities are fully recognised before land diversion. He also demanded that officials be held accountable for “misrepresentation”.Arguing that the Nicobarese community is among India’s most vulnerable groups and has been historically protected under the Protection of Aboriginal Tribes Regulation, 1956, Tagore said, “The strength of our democracy lies in protecting the rights of the weakest. The voice of the Nicobarese must be heard, respected, and upheld in the true spirit of justice”.","Congress MP Manickam Tagore wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking his urgent intervention to protect the constitutional and legal rights of the Nicobarese tribes.

The warning level in Delhi is 204.50 metres, the danger level 205.33 metres, and evacuations are triggered at 206 metres.Citing the risk of flooding, the DDMA ordered closure of public and vehicular movement on the bridge from September 2 at 5 pm, with notices sent to Delhi Police and Railways authorities.he Irrigation and Flood Control Department reported that the Hathnikund barrage released 3,29,313 cusecs of water at 9 am on Monday, while the Wazirabad barrage discharged around 38,900 cusecs as the flood warning was issued.Divisional Commissioner Neeraj Semwal said over 3 lakh cusecs are expected to be released from Hathnikund in the coming days. “District magistrates have been alerted about arrangements for food, electricity, and relief camps.They are closely monitoring the situation,” he told reporters.The heavy discharge pushed the Yamuna’s level to 204.94 metres at the Old Railway Bridge by 5 pm on Monday.

This perhaps explains Rahul Gandhi’s fondness for regularising ineligible and illegal voters, and his opposition to the SIR,"" Malviya had said.This comes a day after Rahul Gandhi concluded INDIA bloc's 1,300-km ""Voter Adhikar Yatra"" in Bihar.Speaking at the concluding event in Patna on Monday, the Congress leader targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying he would not be able to ""show his face to people after we bring the hydrogen bomb of vote chori.""""I want to tell the BJP people.

Examples included entries with “0” in the address field, non-existent locations, and addresses that could not be verified.The opposition has also been protesting against the special intensive revision of the electoral roll, alleging that the EC's exercise is aimed at ""disenfranchising voters"" in Bihar ahead of the assembly elections due later this year.","BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya urged the Election Commission to investigate whether Khera voted multiple times.
