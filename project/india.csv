Same electors voted multiple times in Maha polls: Chavan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/same-electors-voted-multiple-times-in-maha-polls-chavan/articleshow/122169765.cms,"NEW DELHI: Congress's allegation about a suspicious surge in the number of voters in the Maharashtra assembly elections took a new turn Monday when party veteran Prithviraj Chavan told the leadership that the spike was possibly on account of multiple registration and voting by same voters.Former CM Chavan, giving data of his constituency, claimed the same voters were found to have voted multiple times in different polling booths. He alleged the trick was pulled off by erasing the ink that is dabbed on the finger after the casting of vote.Given data presented by Chavan, sources said, the party is likely to scrutinise polling lists and records of other constituencies.The data was presented in a meeting of senior state functionaries.A senior neta said Rahul Gandhi 's charge that there was an increase of 41 lakh voters between 2024 Lok Sabha elections and the assembly polls five months later is correct, but crucial to the conundrum is who were these new voters. ""How was it done? Are they BJP workers? We have to crack this,"" he added.With the upcoming local body elections, the state leaders gave the Congress brass a mixed view on whether to continue with the Maha Vikas Aghadi and contest jointly with Sena (UBT) and NCP (SP), or to go it alone.Mumbai netas are learnt to have demanded that Congress contest the BMC polls separately, arguing that Sena (UBT) votes do not shift to Congress in a pact.",Prithviraj Chavan told the leadership that the spike was possibly on account of multiple registration and voting by same voters.

Outrage in Chhattisgarh: Doctors Protest Insulting Remarks by Additional Collector,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/doctors-protest-in-raipur-over-additional-collector-remarks-and-demand-action/articleshow/122142086.cms,"



RAIPUR: Three prominent doctors' organisations — Junior Doctors' Association (JDA), Chhattisgarh Doctors' Federation (CGDF), and CIDA — held a joint protest in Raipur on Saturday late evening.They submitted a detailed memorandum to the state health minister condemning the alleged misbehaviour and insulting remarks made by an additional collector against a senior lady doctor at Narayanpur District Hospital.The organisations stated that the use of objectionable words like ""do kaudi ke doctor"" (worthless doctor) not only undermined the dignity of the medical profession but also deeply insulted women. This incident caused widespread anger among doctors across the state.The organisations' primary demands include a public apology from the concerned official, an impartial inquiry into the incident, and assurance of disciplinary action. They also seek clear guidelines for the respect, dignity, and safety of doctors at their workplaces, priority for doctors in the allotment of F-type accommodation, and proposals for administrative reforms.The organisations proposed several administrative reforms, such as limiting inspections of health institutions to IAS officers, having health nodal positions and review meetings led only by senior administrative officials, and ensuring complaints related to doctors are investigated only by health department officials (CMHO/CS).They also requested that collectors be instructed to ensure respectful behaviour towards doctors and that no repressive action be taken against doctors participating in peaceful protests.Dr Resham Singh, President, JDA, Dr Heera Singh, President, CGDF, and Dr Piyush Srivastava issued a joint statement condemning the incident. They urged the state govt to intervene and take immediate action.Dr A S Chauhan, spokesperson, CIDA, stated that the govt has been formally informed about the matter through correspondence. He added that if satisfactory action is not taken quickly, organisations across the state may be compelled to suspend their services.The three organisations emphasised that this issue concerns the dignity and safety of the entire medical community, which cannot be ignored.Meanwhile, Narayanpur district collector Pratishtha Mamgain told TOI that the complaint was received on June 19, and the alleged incident may have occurred three to four days prior.“I constituted an inquiry headed by the Narayanpur district panchayat CEO, who is herself a doctor. Initially, the complainant and other doctors posted at the district hospital were reluctant to cooperate and also stalled the OPD work, affecting poor patients seeking treatment. Now that the complainant has begun cooperating, we are hopeful the issue will be resolved soon,"" the district collector said.","Three prominent doctors' organisations held a joint protest in Raipur on Saturday late evening.

With the setback, the Andhra Pradesh govt has to send the proposals afresh to the MoEFCC (river valley and hydroelectric projects) after revising them as per the EAC recommendations.The Telangana govt has been opposing the project as it is detrimental to the interests of the state and also the AP govt was taking up the project against the Godavari Water Disputes Tribunal Award orders and violation of other laws. Chief minister A Revanth Reddy and irrigation minister N Uttam Kumar Reddy had met Union minister of jal shakti CR Patil a few days ago and put for the state's objections. The state govt also conducted an all-party meeting on the Banakacherla issue.The EAC committee at its 33rd meeting discussed the proposal on June 17 and the minutes of the meeting were released on Monday.The members of the committee opined that the proposed scheme aims to divert floodwaters from the Godavari basin (Polavaram Dam) to the water-deficit basins within the state.""The EAC further observed that environmental clearance (EC) for the Indira Sagar Polavaram multipurpose project on the Godavari River, located at Polavaram in AP, was granted by the ministry on Jan 25 2005. However, due to submergence-related issues in Odisha and Chhattisgarh, the matter remains sub-judice,"" the committee members said.The committee also recommended that the project proponent should comprehensively assess the availability of floodwaters in consultation with the Central Water Commission (CWC).""The EAC also said that several representations have been received via email, alleging that the proposed scheme may be in violation of the Godavari Tribunal Award, 1980. In view of this, it is imperative that the project proponent should approach CWC for examining the inter-state issues and granting necessary clearance/permission before submitting the proposal for framing the TOR for conducting the EIA study,"" the EAC meeting opined.","The Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change's (MoEFCC) expert appraisal committee (EAC) has returned the proposal of the link project to the neighbouring state.
