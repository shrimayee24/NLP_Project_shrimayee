Maoist boycott calls fall flat as voters flock to Jarkhand booths

(With inputs from Abhijit Sen in Hazaribagh, Vishvendu Jaipuriar in Chatra, KA Gupta in Gumla and B Sridhar in Jamshedpur)

The overall voter turnout in the first phase of the Jharkhand election on Wednesday, for 43 seats, was 64.8%, higher than 63.7% for these 43 seats in 2019.Rural areas, mostly tribal belts in JMM ’s stronghold of Kolhan division, saw brisk voting since the morning, while urban apathy led to low turnouts across constituencies overlapping Ranchi and Jamshedpur as 1.4 crore voters cast their ballots.At 79.1%, Kharsawan (ST seat) saw the highest turnout, while Ranchi recorded the lowest turnout, 52.3%. Jamshedpur East and West segments settled at 57% and 56.3%, respectively.“In Budha Pahad area in Garhwa district, once considered a stronghold of extremists, long queues, and peaceful polling at Hesatu Polling station signalled the deep penetration of democratic ethos… this polling station was set up in Budha Pahad area for the Lok Sabha Elections 2024, allowing residents to vote in their own village,” Election Commission said on Wednesday.Even as voters lined up outside booths, hectic campaigning for the second phase of the election for the 38 remaining seats, in the crucial JMM strongholds of tribal heartland Santhal Pargana and coal-rich Koylanchal, picked up pace.The final phase of voting will be held on Nov 20. Early in the day, Odisha governor Raghubar Das voted in Jamshedpur (East), while chief minister Hemant Soren and his wife, Kalpana Soren, Rajya Sabha deputy chairman Harivansh Narayan Singh, former Indian cricketer Mahendra Singh Dhoni and other VIPs cast their votes in Ranchi.Former CM Champai Soren, who cast his vote in Seraikela (ST), said BJP would ride home on the issue of infiltration.The INDIA bloc of JMM, Congress and RJD, and NDA, led by BJP Ajsu party and JDU, remained hopeful of a good show in the first phase. Of the 43 seats where voting was held on Wednesday, JMM holds the most seats (17), followed by BJP (12) and Congress (9). In 2019, BJP lost all 14 seats to JMM and Congress in the crucial Kolhan division, which comprises Jamshedpur’s urban seats and the iron-ore rich hinterlands of West Singhbhum and Seraikela-Kharsawan districts.“The farmers, women, workers and the youth sent a clear message today, that the Hemant Soren govt will return to office for another term. Specially, electors in Ranchi, Jamshedpur and other urban constituencies have shattered the myth that JMM is not liked by urban voters,” JMM said in a statement. BJP, on the other hand, claimed it would win two-thirds of the 43 seats that went to polls on Wednesday.In 950 out of the nearly 15,344 polling booths voting ended an hour earlier, keeping in mind the threats from Maoists; polling remained peaceful with no cases of arson, violence or bloodshed being reported till the evening. Voters defied bandh calls by Maoists in Jagannathpur (ST) and Manoharpur (ST) assembly segments and turned up in numbers to exercise their franchise.In Gumla (ST) seat, locals of several villages boycotted polls over unfulfilled demands for roads and bridges but later exercised their franchise upon assurances from the local administration. In Kanke, Congress workers raised an alarm when a BJP polling agent was found with a bag with Modi’s photograph embossed on it.In Simariya (SC) constituency, a 90-year-old prominent folk singer, Saraswati Devi, died two hours after voting after suffering a heart attack. JMM and BJP workers clashed in Tandwa, in Chatra, while women turned out to vote in large numbers in Hazaribagh.","The overall voter turnout in the first phase of the Jharkhand election on Wednesday, for 43 seats, was 64.8%, higher than 63.7% for these 43 seats in 2019.

Stones & sticks fly as Sena factions clash in Mumbai,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/stones-sticks-fly-as-sena-factions-clash-in-mumbai/articleshow/115270117.cms,"MUMBAI: Violent clashes erupted between workers of the Shiv Sena and the Shiv Sena (UBT) outside Matoshree Club in Jogeshwari (East) on Tuesday night. Sticks and stones were hurled around as the violence continued for about an hour despite police intervention.Police sources said workers of the Sena faction, headed by Uddhav Thackeray, had gathered to protest against the alleged distribution of money inside Matoshree Club, leading to riots and demonstrations. Matoshree Club is run by Sena MP Ravindra Waikar , whose wife, Manisha, is an assembly election candidate.Shiv Sena filed two FIRs against Shiv Sena (UBT), alleging an attempt to murder a woman activist by pursuing her vehicle and molestation of a woman politician. Shiv Sena (UBT) responded by filing an FIR against Shiv Sena supporters.Later at a press conference, women workers of Shiv Sena alleged videography by members of the Shiv Sena (UBT), which they said was not stopped despite their objecting to it. They said the matter escalated from there.Harjeet Kaur, a party worker, said she left in a car and noticed Anant Nar, the Shiv Sena (UBT) candidate from the constituency, giving an interview nearby. She said Nar’s son and other party workers saw her and began banging on the car and tried to open the door. “I sped towards Kalpataru (complex nearby). Five men followed me on a bike and entered the Kalpataru gates to hit me,” she said.

PAKUR/DUMKA: Prime Minister Narendra Modi stepped up campaigning in Santhal Pargana for the second phase of the Jharkhand assembly election , calling upon voters to unite and bring BJP into govt if they valued their “roti, beti, and maati (employment, daughters, and land)”.Ahead of polling on Nov 20 for the remaining 38 assembly seats in Jharkhand, PM Modi addressed election rallies at the temple town of Deoghar and in adjacent Godda district, seeking support for NDA candidates contesting 18 seats in Santhal Pargana region.His rallies coincided with the first phase of elections when voting was underway in 43 seats across almost half of Jharkhand. Targeting Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, Modi accused Congress of being against the reservation policy and hinted that the demand for a caste-based census is aimed at dividing people and ending reservation benefits enjoyed by them.“Congress is moving ahead with the dangerous plan of ending reservation so that those lakhs and lakhs of people who stand together on being called Scheduled Tribes , Scheduled Castes, or OBCs do not remain united,” he said, noting that Congress had been wiped out from states in which the SC, ST, or OBC population is dominant.“Congress understands well that they can never get elected if these people remain united, so ending reservation is important for them. But I decided to fight all such forces and remind you—Ek hain to safe hain (United you are safe).” Targeting the Santhal tribes, Modi said demographic changes in Jharkhand were serious and that the number of tribals in Santhal region had been halved in recent years.“For electoral and personal gains, Congress and JMM encourage infiltrators to settle here. If this kind of infiltration in Jharkhand continues, not just land and daughters, the entire state will be at risk,” he said. Claiming Congress was anti-tribal and that its politicians demean tribal leaders, Modi cited the example of Sita Soren being abused by a Congress candidate.","PM Narendra Modi steps up campaigning in Santhal Pargana for the second phase of the Jharkhand assembly election.

MUMBAI: NCP candidate from Mankhurd Shivaji Nagar , Nawab Malik , said on Tuesday that the anti-conversion law mooted in BJP’s manifesto for Maharashtra is just being used to misguide people and his party will not join a govt with the saffron party “if it does politics on divisive and disputed issues”. Malik also did not rule out NCP joining hands with the opposition MVA in the event of a hung assembly.Though NCP is part of Mahayuti , BJP, the seniormost partner in the governing alliance, is backing Shinde Sena’s Suresh Patil in Mankhurd Shivaji Nagar.Stressing that if Mahayuti gets a majority, the govt will not be formed on BJP’s policies alone but on a Common Minimum Programme, Malik told TOI in an interview: “BJP will have to leave out some issues.”When asked about UP CM Yogi Adityanath’s ‘Batenge toh Katenge’ call, which is seen as anti-Muslim, Malik said: “I condemn this slogan. Religion based on politics is short-lived.” On BJP’s promise to bring anti-conversion law, Malik said: “Right to religion is a fundamental right and conversion cannot be stopped. BJP is playing with words to misguide people.”Malik said NCP chief Ajit Pawar will get enough seats to become a ‘kingmaker’ and dictate terms. “It’s possible that there will be a situation like 1999 when neither side has absolute majority.”When asked whether NCP could back MVA in a post-poll scenario, he said: “Anything is possible.

RAIPUR: Chhattisgarh HC Wednesday quashed all three FIRs filed against 1994-batch IPS officer G P Singh in connection with sedition, extortion and disproportionate assets charges.A division bench noted that the FIRs seem to have been filed solely to harass him. Singh was an ADGP when the FIRs were registered. According to Singh’s counsel, among the key reasons for quashing the FIR was that the person from whose custody a 1kg gold bar was seized, was not made an accused under the Prevention of Corruption Act, and the scooter where it was found wasn’t registered in Singh’s name.Similarly, in the extortion case, the FIR was registered after a gap of six years and the complainant was not known to Singh, said the counsel. And in the sedition matter, the original documents were never produced in the court and from the videography conducted by the anti-corruption bureau, it was not proved that Singh was ‘tearing a paper that had seditious content’, Singh’s counsel added.The court noted the absence of evidence in the FIRs, which “appeared to have been filed solely for harassment purposes”, leading to their dismissal.","Chhattisgarh HC quashed all three FIRs filed against 1994-batch IPS officer G P Singh in connection with sedition, extortion and disproportionate assets charges.

We do what our seniors tell us to: Ajit on 2019 BJP talks

Proof Maharashtra sarkar is Adani sarkar: Opposition

MUMBAI: Industrialist Gautam Adani was part of political talks between BJP and the undivided Sharad Pawar-led NCP five years ago, Ajit Pawar said on Tuesday. He was referring to discussions that happened just before he joined hands with BJP and formed a short-lived govt with Devendra Fadnavis as CM and himself as deputy CM in 2019. “Amit Shah, Gautam Adani, Praful Patel, Fadnavis & Pawar Saheb... All were there...,” Ajit Pawar said in an interview to Newslaundry.When asked about the ideological incompatibility between NCP and BJP and his having gone with BJP in spite of it, he said BJP formed the govt in Maharashtra in 2014 after NCP declared outside support. “When results of the 2014 assembly polls were out, NCP spokesperson Praful Patel declared we will support BJP from outside,” Ajit said.After 2014 assembly polls, NCP spokesperson Praful Patel had declared support for BJP from outside, Ajit Pawar said, adding NCP later declared the support was not permanent but only for forming govt, resulting in BJP and Sena coming together again.Asked further on the subject, he said, “we do what our senior functionaries tell us” and referred to the ‘meeting’ before his early morning swearing-in with Fadnavis. “It has been five years, everyone knows where the meeting happened, it was in Delhi at a businessman’s house, everyone knows it. Yes, there were five meetings… Amit Shah was there, Gautam Adani was there, Praful Patel was there, Devendra Fadnavis was there, Pawar Saheb was there… All were there... Everything was decided.” He further said, “Blame for it has fallen on me, and I have taken it. I took blame and made others safe.”Asked why Pawar Senior then later hesitated and didn’t go with BJP, Ajit said he didn’t know the reason. “Pawar Saheb is a leader whose mind no one in the world can read. Not even our aunty (Sharad Pawar’s wife Pratibha) or our Supriya (Sule).” Sharad Pawar has consistently denied any involvement with power-sharing talks with BJP in 2019. BJP’s Devendra Fadnavis had alleged last year that Pawar had had a series of meeting with BJP between 2017 and 2019.Asked about him having split NCP, Ajit said there was no question of a split and “one who has the majority controls the party.”Questioned if the Pawar family could get together again, he said, “I haven’t thought about it now. Right now my focus is on the elections and on Mahayuti winning 175 seats.”On the matter of ideology, Ajit asked how Shiv Sena had allied with Congress and NCP for 2.5 years during MVA rule. “When we were told to work with them, we did.” He subsequently said, “Don’t ask about ideology. Maharashtra’s politics has changed. Everyone wants power and has kept ideology aside. They want to form and run a govt.”He denied that charges of corruption made against him had anything to do with him going with BJP. “Allegations were made in 2009 and I went with BJP in 2023,” he said. He further said he was cleared in cases because there was no evidence against him at all. “If I had been guilty, there would have been action against me,” he said.Ajit went back to Sharad Pawar after the swearing-in in 2019 as he could get the support of only a few NCP MLAs, with most party legislators sticking to Pawar Senior. Later in 2023, he carried a majority of the party’s legislators with him when he joined the Eknath Shinde-led Mahayuti govt.Congress and Shiv Sena (UBT) functionaries reacted sharply to Ajit Pawar’s revelation about industrialist Gautam Adani being part of BJP-NCP talks in 2019, saying it was proof the Maharashtra govt was “Adani sarkar.” Gautam Adani was not available for comment.Mumbai Congress president and MP Varsha Gaikwad said information had “come from the horse’s mouth” now. In a post on X, she said, “What was Gautam Adani’s locus standi, why was he sitting in the meetings regarding the formation of govt? I reiterate, MVA govt was destabilised only for Adani, so that he could get Dharavi and any other projects he wanted. This is why we say, this is not Maharashtra sarkar, but Adani sarkar. Now, the truth is there for everyone to see.”UBT Shiv Sena spokesperson and MP Priyanka Chaturvedi stated in a post, “As per Ajit Pawarji, this meeting was in 2019 when Devendra Fadnavis became the shortest duration chief minister in a very early morning ceremony… Adani sarkar for a reason. As per the interview given to a digital platform by a senior minister, Gautam Adani sat through in meetings to decide how to get BJP to power in the state by trying to fix unlikely alliances, it raises some serious questions. Is he a BJP authorised negotiator, has he been given the responsibility to fix alliances, why is a businessmen so keenly and closely working to bring BJP to power at any cost in Maharashtra?..Bol Dharavi Bol.”BJP did not comment but in the past, Fadnavis has said Sharad Pawar has had a series of meetings with BJP between 2017 and 2019.",NCP chief Ajit Pawar says industrialist Gautam Adani was part of political talks between BJP and undivided Sharad Pawar-led NCP five years ago.

The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections , which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases. The results will be declared on November 23, along with Maharashtra.In the Tribal-dominated state, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and CM Hemant's Soren Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) are in a direct fight, while the Congress party and Lalu Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) are in alliance with the JMM.The JMM-Congress-RJD alliance are also reportedly seeking to deal with Left parties, Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party and other tribal outfits that have been contesting the elections in the state as independent entities and make efforts to field candidates against the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) on all 81 seats collectively.In the last assembly polls in 2019, the JMM-Congress-RJD alliance won a comfortable majority of 47 seats in a House of 81.The BJP slipped to 25 seats from 37 it held in 2014. The poor performance was perceived to be the outcome of its decision to contest alone backfiring. The party did not foster an alliance with the Ajsu in the 2019 polls when Raghubar Das, currently the Odisha governor, was serving the state as CM.In this year's Lok Sabha polls in Jharkhand, the BJP-led NDA secured nine out of the 14 seats, with the BJP winning eight and its alliance partner, the Ajsu (All Jharkhand Students Union) Party, retaining its single seat.On the other hand, the opposition India bloc improved its tally, increasing its seat count from two in 2019 to five in the parliamentary polls.BJP and JMM have spruced up their pace of campaigning from the ground zero to social media. BJP and JMM leaders are actively rebutting and challenging each other on a range of issues, including illegal immigration, youth welfare, employment and housing.INDIA bloc parties in Jharkhand slammed the EC for holding assembly elections in the state along with that of Maharashtra but claimed that they were ready to slug it out with BJP-led NDA, which has welcomed the announcement of poll dates.JMM, Congress, and CPI (ML-L) said the announcement showed that EC was in a hurry to conduct elections though the assembly tenure was due to end in January next year.Also, both the INDIA bloc and BJP-led NDA are expected to get into huddles to discuss the modalities of seat-sharing which is going to be a challenge for both the competing teams.","The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections, which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases.

The counting of votes will be on November 23.Maharashtra is gearing up for elections as the two major political alliances—the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) and the Mahayuti—prepare to face each other for the first time in a Vidhan Sabha election.The Maha Vikas Aghadi, comprise of the Congress, the Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray), and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) under Sharad Pawar, will go head-to-head with the Mahayuti , which includes the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Shiv Sena faction led by Eknath Shinde, and the NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar. This will be the first electoral contest between these two alliances since the splits within the Shiv Sena and NCP.The MVA is hopeful of replicating its recent Lok Sabha success, while the Mahayuti aims to retain power by leveraging its populist schemes targeted at women and youth. Both alliances have set their sights on winning the state.Narayan Rane, a former Union Minister and the victor in the Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg Lok Sabha constituency, is poised to be a key figure for the BJP in the Konkan region during the forthcoming elections. Meanwhile, two constituencies are expected to be critical battlegrounds: chief minister Eknath Shinde's Kopri-Pachpakdi seat in Thane City and Worli in Mumbai, where Aaditya Thackeray, a leader of the Shiv Sena (UBT), is seeking reelection.In the last Vidhan Sabha elections in 2019, the BJP secured 26.1% of the votes, the Congress 16.1%, the NCP 16.9%, and the Shiv Sena 16.6%. The BJP and the Shiv Sena (then united) formed the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which secured a majority. However, the coalition soon crumbled due to disagreements over government formation, plunging the state into a political crisis.After no party could establish a government, Maharashtra was placed under President's rule. Devendra Fadnavis was briefly sworn in as chief minister, with Ajit Pawar as deputy chief minister. However, both resigned just days later before a scheduled floor test.By November 28, 2019, a new coalition emerged, with the Shiv Sena (Uddhav faction), NCP (Sharad Pawar faction), and Congress forming the Maha Vikas Aghadi government, led by Uddhav Thackeray as chief minister.The state's politics took another turn in June, 2022, when Uddhav Thackeray resigned following a rebellion within the Shiv Sena, led by Eknath Shinde, who then allied with the BJP. Eknath Shinde assumed the role of chief minister, with Devendra Fadnavis returning as deputy chief minister.",The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra.

Wayanad bypolls: Voting under way for Priyanka Gandhi Vadra's electoral debut,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/wayanad-bypolls-voting-under-way-for-priyanka-gandhi-vadras-electoral-debut/articleshow/115236152.cms,"NEW DELHI: Voting is currently under way in Kerala’s Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency as Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra makes her highly anticipated electoral debut.Polling started at 7 am and will continue until 6 pm.This bypoll gained importance after Rahul Gandhi , who held the seat since 2019, decided to vacate Wayanad to retain Raebareli in Uttar Pradesh, a seat he also won in the 2024 general elections. Days after the June 4 election results, Congress announced Rahul’s decision to vacate Wayanad, paving the way for Priyanka’s entry into the constituency.Priyanka is competing against 15 candidates, including Sathyan Mokeri of the Left Democratic Front (LDF) and Navya Haridas of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). The Election Commission has prepared extensively for this bypoll, distributing polling materials across 1,354 booths, all equipped with webcasting facilities to monitor the voting process.Historically a Congress stronghold, Wayanad has consistently elected Congress MPs since its establishment in 2008, with Rahul Gandhi securing landslide victories in both 2019 and 2024, with margins of 4.3 lakh and 3.6 lakh votes, respectively. The United Democratic Front (UDF) is now mounting an intensive campaign to secure a substantial win for Priyanka, banking on her appeal and the traditional Congress support base of minorities, settler farmers, and tribal communities. Her campaign rallies have drawn large female audiences, which the UDF interprets as a promising indicator for her chances in the election.Sathyan Mokeri, the LDF candidate, is focused on retaining the Left’s voter base, as he did in 2014 when he reduced the Congress's victory margin. Meanwhile, NDA candidate Navya Haridas has conducted a targeted campaign, focusing on key areas of support and reaching out to Christian voters by addressing issues like the waqf dispute.The campaign concluded with a “Kottikalasham” (festive closing ceremony), followed by a day of silent campaigning. Priyanka chose a low-key approach on election eve, visiting a farm and the Banasura Sagar dam, while her LDF and NDA counterparts engaged with voters across the constituency. UDF is hopeful for a turnout exceeding the 73.5% recorded in 2024, ideally reaching the 80.3% turnout seen in 2019.The LDF is relying on its organisational strength and Mokeri’s local recognition, while NDA aims to maintain the increased vote share it achieved in the 2024 general elections. With polling well underway, Wayanad’s 14.7 lakh voters will determine the outcome of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s first step into electoral politics.","Priyanka is competing against 15 candidates, including Sathyan Mokeri of the Left Democratic Front (LDF) and Navya Haridas of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) The Election Commission has prepared extensively for this bypoll, distributing polling materials across 1,354 booths.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115236250,imgsize-739793,width-400,resizemode-4/115236250.jpg"
