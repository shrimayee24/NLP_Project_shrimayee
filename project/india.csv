SC reinstates elected man convicted for gambling and fined Rs 200,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-reinstates-elected-man-convicted-for-gambling-and-fined-rs-200/articleshow/121174654.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday set aside a Karnataka HC’s decision to disqualify a man elected to the board of directors of a cooperative society by securing highest votes on the ground that his conviction under the state police Act for roadside gambling constituted a misconduct involving moral turpitude.One Hanumantharayappa YC along with some others were allegedly playing cards on the roadside when they were caught by police, which levied a fine of Rs 200 without any trial. The man later contested elections to a post in the Board of Directors of Govt Porcelain Factory Employees Housing Cooperative Society and won with highest votes. But his election was set aside by the Registrar of society, which was upheld by HC.Reversing the HC order and reinstating the petitioner in the Board of Directors of the cooperative society, a bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh said, “In the very nature of things, we find it difficult that the misconduct attributed to the appellant involves moral turpitude. It is well known that the expression ‘moral turpitude’ is used in legal as well as societal parlance to describe a conduct which is inherently debased, vile, depraved or having some connection showing depravity.”Justice Kant said, “Every action against which one can raise an eyebrow may not necessarily involve moral turpitude. There are so many forms of playing cards. It is difficult to accept that every form of such playing would involve moral turpitude, especially when it is played as a mode of entertainment and recreation.”“In fact, in most parts of our country, playing cards without an element of gambling or betting is accepted as a Poorman’s source of entertainment. That apart, the appellant has not been found to be a habitual gambler,” the bench said.“Pertinently, the appellant has been elected to the Board of Directors of the Society with the highest votes. The consequential punishment of setting aside his election is highly disproportionate to the nature of misconduct said to have been committed by him,” it said while setting aside the judgment of the HC and orders of the authorities that disqualified him from holding office as a director of the society.",The Supreme Court on Wednesday set aside a Karnataka HC’s decision to disqualify a man elected to the board of directors of a cooperative society.

‘Language of gutters by MP minister’: HC orders FIR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/language-of-gutters-by-mp-minister-hc-orders-fir/articleshow/121171440.cms,"Representative photo

File FIR on min for using ‘

gutter language

’ against Qureshi: HC

BHOPAL/JABALPUR: Madhya Pradesh high court took suo motu cognisance on Wednesday of state minister Vijay Shah’s remarks on Colonel Sofiya Qureshi , one of the two officers who were the face of the Indian armed forces during Operation Sindoor , and ordered the state DGP to register an FIR against him for using “gutter language” against a woman Army officer.HC ordered that the case be listed on top of the cause list Thursday and warned that if the FIR isn’t filed by then, the DGP will face contempt proceedings. Late Wednesday, CM Mohan Yadav said the order would be followed and an FIR was subsequently filed.The FIR was registered at Manpur police station in Ambedkar Nagar (Mhow) under the BNS sections specified by the court: 152, 196 (1) (b) and 197 (a) (c).A division bench of justices Atul Shreedharan and Anuradha Shukla said: “This court has been compelled to take up this matter suo motu on account of an incident published in various newspapers and digital media networks that has taken place at a public function at village Raikunda in Ambedkar Nagar, at Mhow, on Monday. A sitting minister of MP govt, whose name is Vijay Shah, has used scurrilous language against a senior official of the Indian Army.”The judges said the armed forces are perhaps the “last institution existing in this country”, reflecting integrity, industry, discipline, sacrifice, selflessness, character, honour and indomitable courage, with which any citizen of this country who values the same can identify themselves with. India’s armed forces have been “targeted by Vijay Shah who has used the language of the gutters”, the court said.“…the minister made a nauseating remark against Col Qureshi by way of an innuendo which can refer to none other than her alone, as there is no one else who would fit the description of the comment made by the minister,” HC said. “There are newspaper reports and a plethora of digital material on the internet in which the minister’s speech is clear and unequivocal… His comments are disparaging and dangerous, not just to the officer in question but to the armed forces itself.”Shah’s comment “encourages feelings of separatist activities by imputing separatist feelings to anyone who is Muslim, which thereby endangers the sovereignty or unity and integrity of India. Thus this court is prima facie satisfied that the first offence made out... is under BNS Sec 152”, the court said.","Madhya Pradesh high court took suo motu cognisance of state minister Vijay Shah’s remarks on Colonel Sofiya Qureshi. Shah used ‘gutter language’ against a woman Army officer, the court said.
