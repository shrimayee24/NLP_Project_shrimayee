Bihar polls: Lalu jumps gun amid bickering over seat sharing deal in INDIA bloc; distributes tickets to RJD leaders,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-polls-lalu-jumps-gun-amid-bickering-over-seat-sharing-deal-in-india-bloc-distributes-tickets-to-rjd-leaders/articleshow/124543155.cms,"(With agency inputs)

NEW DELHI: A seat-sharing deal has yet to be announced by the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD)-led Mahagathbandhan, despite the last date for nomination for the first phase of Bihar assembly elections inching closer. However, RJD patriarch Lalu Prasad Yadav on Monday jumped the gun and gave away party tickets to candidates favoured by him.A large crowd gathered outside Lalu's residence after he reached Patna from Delhi, where he had appeared before a court . According to news agency PTI, aspirants who apparently received phone calls from the party began pouring in, only to emerge minutes later with the party symbol in their hands and a broad smile on their faces.Prominent among those who got RJD symbols were Sunil Singh (Parbatta), who quit chief minister Nitish Kumar's JD(U) last week, and Narendra Kumar Singh alias Bogo, a several-term former MLA from Matihani, who had won the seat twice for the party headed by the CM.These leaders' candidature is being seen as part of the strategy of Tejashwi Yadav, the RJD supremo's son and heir apparent, to win over a section of Bhumihars, a powerful upper caste that has traditionally supported the BJP-led NDA.However, the party symbols were reportedly taken back from the leaders.This is not the first time Lalu has distributed tickets to his party leaders without a nod from alliance partners. Ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, he had given tickets to several RJD leaders well before Congress , RJD, and Left parties had reached a seat-sharing agreement.However, the alliance partners eventually fell in line.This comes as Lalu's son Tejashwi met Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi on Monday evening and is learnt to have discussed a seat-sharing arrangement ahead of the Bihar assembly polls. Congress general secretary (Organisation) K C Venugopal and the party's in-charge for Bihar, Krishna Allavaru, were present during the meeting at Kharge's residence, PTI reported, citing sources.Sources said Tejashwi Yadav had earlier held discussions with Allavaru and Venugopal, where Bihar Congress chief Rajesh Ram and CLP leader in the Bihar Vidhan Sabha Shakeel Ahmad Khan were also present.The Mahagathbandhan in Bihar is likely to finalise seat-sharing in the next few days and may announce its candidates along with a joint manifesto this week. The Congress is likely to get fewer seats than last time due to its dismal performance in the 2020 assembly polls, when it won 19 out of the 70 seats it contested. The RJD contested 144 seats and bagged 75 in the 243-member assembly.On the other side, BJP state in-charge Dharmendra Pradhan on Sunday announced that JD(U) and BJP will contest 101 seats each; Chirag Paswan-led Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vikas) on 29 seats; and Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) of Jitan Ram Manjhi and the Rashtriya Lok Morcha (RLM) of Upendra Kushwaha will contest six seats each.Bihar assembly polls are slated in two phases on November 6 and 11, and the counting of votes will be conducted on November 14. The filing of nominations began on October 10 for the first phase, in which 121 seats will go to the polls.",Last date for nomination for first phase of Bihar assembly elections inching closer.

NEW DELHI: The seesaw in the Bihar seat-sharing saga seems to continue in the Mahagathbandhan as no party in the bloc appears to get off first without squeezing out every last seat possible.In the RJD-led Mahagathbandhan, allies are busy balancing ambition and arithmetic, each hoping to tip the scale in their favour before the final deal is struck.In Bihar's opposition camp, the tension isn't just political. It's poetic. As seat-sharing talks appear to hit a rough patch, RJD’s Manoj Jha and Congress MP Imran Pratapgarhi traded shayaris that spoke volumes about the unease simmering between the allies.After RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav met Congress MP Rahul Gandhi on the seat-sharing agreement, Manoj Jha wrote on X: "". (“Don’t snap the thread of love, Rahim says — once broken, it may be tied again, but the knot will always remain"".)Replying to ally Manoj Jha's post, Congress MP Imran Pratapgarhi wrote: """" (Tears can still be brought to the eyes; even a burning city can still be saved.)The rhyme didn't just reveal the rift, but it sparked the question: Can the Mahagathbandhan stay united, or are its allies gearing up to go solo?The seat-sharing puzzle in Bihar’s Mahagathbandhan continues to test tempers and timing. Despite several rounds of talks between the Congress, RJD and Left leaders, the INDIA bloc is yet to crack the final formula.“Tejashwi and Congress leaders may finalise seat-sharing in the next few days and could announce their candidates along with a joint manifesto this week,” an RJD functionary said.Bihar Congress in-charge Krishna Allavaru sounded cautious yet confident: “Seat distribution is being finalised. The list of candidates will be released soon. Our effort is to form a good govt for the people of Bihar so that the alliance is not harmed and Bihar benefits.”But the Congress may have to settle for a smaller slice this time, given its poor 2020 performance, bagging only 19 of the 70 seats it contested. The RJD, by contrast, had fought 144 seats and won 75 in the 243-member Assembly.Earlier on Monday, the Congress held its Central Election Committee (CEC) meeting in New Delhi to fine-tune its Bihar strategy. Rahul Gandhi, Mallikarjun Kharge , KC Venugopal, and BPCC chief Rajesh Ram were among those present.Rajesh Ram said, “All issues were discussed in the INDIA alliance meeting, in which Rahul Gandhi and other senior leaders participated. The discussions were positive, and preparations for seat announcements are underway. There is a possibility of a meeting with Tejashwi Yadav soon.”Meanwhile, sources said VIP chief Mukesh Sahni has been offered 18 seats by the RJD, of which 10 would have RJD’s own candidates contesting on the VIP symbol. The RJD, not waiting for last-minute chaos, has already asked its likely candidates to begin filing nominations for the first phase of polling.","The seat-sharing puzzle in Bihar’s Mahagathbandhan continues to test tempers and timing.

CHANDIGARH: In a late-night development, the Haryana government has sent Director General of Police (DGP) Shatrujeet Kapur on leave amid the controversy surrounding the death of senior IPS officer Y Puran Kumar, who had named Kapur in his suicide note. The decision has come just a day before the leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi was to visit the victim officer's family.The decision comes following a tense standoff, with the family of the deceased officer refusing to allow the autopsy or cremation of the body until Kapur was removed from his post. Rajiv Jaitly, media adviser to CM Haryana confirmed the development over phone. However, the official order was not released till the filing of this report.Y. Puran Kumar, a senior Haryana cadre 2001 cadre IPS officer, had committed suicide on October 7 leaving behind a detailed eight page suicide note in which he had name DGP Kapur triggering widespread outrage and demands for action.The state government on Saturday transferred another IPS officer, Narendra Bijrania, who was also accused by the deceased cop for harassing him along with Kapur, from the post of SP Rohtak.In his “final note”, Kumar accused several senior officers, including Kapur and Bijarniya, of harassment and caste-based discrimination, which he claimed contributed to his distress. A total of 16 officers including IAS and IPS were named by Kumar before taking the extreme step.The dead body of the deceased cop is lying in mortuary, as the deceased's wife P Amneet Kumar, who is also a 2001 batch IAS officer, has been demanding action against Kapur. The Haryana IAS officers association had also appealed to the Chandigarh administration and the Haryana government to take appropriate action on Amneet’s complaint filed with the Chandigarh Police on Wednesday and her representation given to the Haryana CM. In her complaint, Amneet alleged that her husband had endured “years of systematic humiliation, harassment, and persecution” at the hands of senior officials, particularly DGP Shatrujeet Singh Kapur.On Sunday, a ‘Mahapanchayat’ (congregation) was also organized in Chandigarh by 31-Member Committee fighting for justice to Puran Kumar’s family in which a 48-hour ultimatum has been given to the Chandigarh Administration and the Haryana government. The deadline was to end on Tuesday.The primary demand of the committee was immediate removal of Haryana DGP Shatrujeet Kapur from his post within 48 hours.In a rare gesture, the Haryana governor Aseem Kumar Ghosh had also visited the deceased officer's family on Sunday to offer condolences.On October 9, the Chandigarh police had registered an FIR against ""all those named in the final note"" on charges of abetment to suicide and sections of SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act. The original FIR had invoked section 3(1)(r) of the Act, which provides for a jail term of a minimum six months, extendable to five years, and a fine. Apart from this, the police had also charged the accused under section 108 of BNS for abetting suicide, which provides for a maximum sentence of 10 years.In the FIR’s column, which provides details of accused/suspect, the FIR had referred all those mentioned in deceased officer’s suicide note including around 16 senior IPS/IAS officers with specific allegations against Haryana DGP Shatrujeet Kapur and the then Rohtak SP Narendra Bijarnia. However, on October 12, the Chandigarh police amended the FIR to include Section 3(2)(v) of the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, which provides a punishment of life imprisonment and a fine if the offence is found to be motivated by the victim’s caste.",Haryana DGP Shatrujeet Kapur sent on leave amid controversy surrounding death of senior IPS officer Y Puran Kumar.

Congress questions 'respect' for allies



Weeks of negotiation



NEW DELHI: The ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in Bihar has finalised its seat-sharing for the upcoming assembly elections, after days of intense negotiations among allies.After earlier demanding 15 seats for his party, Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) chief and Union minister Jitan Ram Manjhi struck a somewhat contradictory tone following the seat-sharing announcement. While he expressed satisfaction with the six seats allotted to HAM(S), he also suggested that the NDA had undervalued his party and warned that such decisions could have repercussions within the alliance.""What the high command decided, we accept, but by giving six seats, they have undervalued us, it may have repercussions in NDA,"" he said.""In Parliament, we were given one seat, still we were happy. Here, we have been given six seats, and we respect the decision of the leadership.""""We are satisfied with what we have been allotted and we have no complaints,"" he added.Prior to the announcement, all eyes were on Chirag Paswan's LJP (RV), Union minister Jitan Ram Manjhi led HAM(S). While Chirag made a strong pitch for a larger share by leveraging his party’s 100% strike rate in Bihar during the recent Lok Sabha elections, Manjhi sought dignity and recognition, reportedly demanding at least 15 seats to maintain HAM(S)’s previous strike rate from the 2020 Assembly polls.The final seat allocation was announced by Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan was: BJP and Janata Dal (United) will contest on 101 seats each, while Chirag Paswan-led Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) will field candidates on 29 seats. Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) and Upendra Kushwaha’s Rashtriya Lok Morcha (RLM) will contest six seats each.Congress latched onto the seat-sharing announcement criticising NDA's 'treatment' of smaller allies.“What has Manjhi ji been saying over the past 15 days? His community was allocated 6 seats in the NDA. Upendra Kushwaha got 6 seats, indicating NDA assigned this many to the Kushwaha community. Does this mean the Kushwaha community is worth only 6 seats in Bihar?” Congress leader Manoj Kumar asked.Kumar further questioned if Chirag Paswan, who reportedly sought 40 seats, was truly respected with 29. Accusing the NDA of undermining key caste groups, he claimed the alliance had been “preparing to deal with” its allies rather than honouring them.""This was done because preparations were underway in the NDA to deal with these people... Jitan Ram Manjhi asked for respect, so did he receive it with 6 seats?"" he questioned.The seat-sharing announcement followed intense parleys in New Delhi over the weekend, involving top NDA figures including BJP president JP Nadda, Union ministers Amit Shah and Rajnath Singh, and Bihar leaders such as deputy CM Samrat Choudhary and state BJP chief Dilip Jaiswal.While BJP has sacrificed some seats (down from 110 in 2020), it seems to have emerged as the dominant partner in terms of influence, evident in how it brokered peace among allies and ensured cohesion ahead of the two-phase elections scheduled for November 6 and 11. Vote counting will take place on November 14.On the other side of the political aisle, the INDIA bloc led by the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) is yet to finalise its seat-sharing formula. RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav, his son Tejashwi Yadav, and wife Rabri Devi have travelled to Delhi amid reports of tension with the Congress, which is pushing to contest close to 70 seats—similar to its 2020 tally, when it won 19.","The ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in Bihar has finalised its seat- sharing for the upcoming assembly elections.

KOLKATA: A 48-year-old YouTuber from Bengal with almost 4.3 million followers and his teenage son were arrested in North 24 Parganas district’s Haroa on Sunday for allegedly raping a 15-year- old girl after luring her with the promise of featuring her in comedy and dance reels.The survivor’s father is a cop attached to Kolkata Police. Basirhat sub-divisional court remanded Arabindu Mondal in police custody for five days and sent his son to a juvenile offenders’ home. Investigators said father and son approached the Class 9 student several months ago with an offer to make shorts with her.The girl went with them to various locations for shoots, and the two allegedly filmed and photographed her secretly when she was changing. “The duo used this to blackmail her into silence after repeated sexual assault. Arabindu’s son even put vermillion on the part of her hair to suggest he would marry her, then raped her,” a police officer said.Sources said the girl’s family, who knew and trusted Arabindu, had no inkling of what she was being subjected to until she confided in them. The suspects were arrested immediately after Haroa police station registered an FIR under the Pocso Act on Sunday and recorded the survivor’s statement. Investigators seized phones, cameras and other devices from Arabindu, who runs two YouTube channels —one for videos and shorts of him performing skits, and another where he dances to Hindi and Bengali songs.","The survivor’s father is a cop attached to Kolkata Police.

Poll Do you think road maintenance in your city is adequate? Yes, roads are well maintained No, more attention is needed





BHOPAL: A major road accident was averted when a 100-metre stretch of road near Sukhi Sevania on the outskirts of Bhopal caved in on Monday afternoon, as there was no traffic on the road at the time of the incident. The Sukhi Sevania police swung into action, closing traffic on the road which caved in.The MP Road Development Corporation (MPRDC), which maintains the road, also announced a probe into the cave-in by a panel led by a chief engineer. Constructed in 2013, the road in question is part of Indore-Jabalpur bypass and connects Indore, Hoshangabad, Jabalpur, Mandla and Sagar.The road was constructed in 2013 under buildoperation-transfer (BOT) model by a company but in 2020, contract with the company was cancelled as it failed to meet the terms and conditions of the contract, said MPRDC officials. According to eyewitnesses, the road started developing cracks all of a sudden and soon a stretch of the road caved in.In July, the busy road near Jyoti Talkies in MP Nagar had also similarly caved in. However, as with Monday’s incident, there was also no damage to life and property then. The PWD, which maintains the road, blamed the incident on the underground nullah flowing beneath the road responsible. The caved-in portion of the road had still not been barricaded till last reports.Sharing details of the incident, PWD principal secretary Sukhveer Singh said a stretch of the road on Bhopal eastern bypass collapsed due to damage to one side of the retaining wall of the ROB. There was no loss of life or property. He said a committee, comprising chief engineer BS Meena, general managers Manoj Gupta and RS Chandel, has been constituted to probe into reasons behind the incident and strict action would follow against persons found guilty for the collapse.PWD Minister Rakesh Singh, who was at Delhi airport, told ToI that he had come to know of the incident just then. He said he would collect more information on his return to Bhopal but promised there would be a probe, including the technical aspects that possibly contributed to the cave-in, and the guilty won't be spared. He added that the road would be repaired soon.Rakesh Sonkar, an eyewitness, said that he was going to Kalyanpura when one side of the road beyond the ROB started developing cracks and in no time, a portion of the road collapsed. He said people nearby and those commuting on the stretch immediately informed police of the cave-in. Soon, a police team rushed to the spot and diverted traffic.Station house officer (SHO), Sukhi Sevania police station, Rambabu Chaudhary, said he received information about 12 noon that the road had developed cracks and was sinking. “We rushed to the spot and barricaded the road. A police contingent was also deployed at the scene,” the SHO said. Later, officials of the MPRDC also visited the spot.Some Congress leaders also reached the spot following the incident and staged a demonstration alleging poor quality of roads and public infrastructure under the BJP government.Manoj Shukla, who led the Congress agitation at the site, said a major accident could have taken place if a truck or a bus had been passing at the time the road sank at least 30 feet below the surface. The Congress leader also pointed to the train line that passes close to the road while adding that Sukhi Sevania railway station was close by.Sukhi Sewania SHO Rambabu Choudhary said traffic was diverted following the road collapse, and police personnel were deployed at the site. He added that approximately 50 metres of the road near the ROB on the Sukhi Sewania–Kalyanpur/Bilkhiria stretch sank.The retaining wall collapsed, and about 30 feet of the 40-foot-wide lane was damaged. Traffic was immediately diverted around noon after cracks were first noticed on the road.","A 100-metre stretch of road near Sukhi Sevania on the outskirts of Bhopal caved in on Monday afternoon.
