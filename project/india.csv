AAP claims 12 'retired terrorists' in BJP; BJP hits back with one name,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/aap-claims-12-retired-terrorists-in-bjp-bjp-hits-back-with-one-name/articleshow/123874680.cms,"SRINAGAR: A day after AAP released a list of BJP representatives in Kashmir who it alleged were former terrorists trained in Pakistan, the BJP hit back with its own list, naming an AAP representative who allegedly was involved in a terror case. While the BJP cited only one AAP name, accusing him of past involvement in terrorism, AAP’s longer list rattled BJP.“How does Aam Aadmi Party justify giving a ticket in Devsar (Kulgam) to Sheikh Fida Hussain, a person with police records linking him to terrorist activities? He was arrested in a terror case, spent over a year in jail under Tada,” BJP J&K spokesperson Manzoor Ahmad Bhat claimed, adding that Hussain lost badly in the 2024 electionAnother BJP J&K spokesperson, Altaf Thakur, didn’t refute the AAP list. He told TOI that they are not going to take any action against any party member as of now. “These people have worked in Ikhwan as well and have remained counter-insurgents after surrender. That aspect has to be seen also,” he said.“AAP has once again exposed its pro-Khalistan mindset. Its Rajya Sabha MP Raghav Chadha, instead of focusing on his medical visit, rushed to meet a known pro-Khalistan British MP, Preet Gill, in the UK.This is not a coincidence it is a continuation of AAP’s dangerous flirtation with separatist forces,” Bhat alleged. “From giving tickets to terrorist-linked candidates in Kashmir to rubbing shoulders with Khalistan sympathisers abroad, AAP has proved it stands with anti-India elements rather than with the nation,” Bhat claimed.However, it is AAP Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh's long list of BJP politicians, whom he alleged were “retired terrorists”, that has worried the party. On Friday, Singh named a number of BJP members who were former militants, including “Abdul Rehman Lone”, “Fayaz Ahmed Nazar”, “Abdul Rahman Tikri”, “Abdul Majeed Mir”, “Ghulam Mohiuddin Sufi”, “Javed Ahmed Mir”, “Zahoor Ahmed Sheikh”, “Gulzar Ahmad Malik”, “Farooq Ahmed Khan”, “Mohammad Ashraf Hajam”, “Talib Hussain Shah”.","AAP released a list of BJP representatives in Kashmir who it alleged were former terrorists trained in Pakistan.

NEW DELHI: The seat-sharing negotiations for upcoming assembly elections in Bihar have become more complex as two new parties - Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and Pashupati Paras's LJP faction - joined the Mahagathbandhan alliance. The situation is getting trickier as major parties are firm on their seat demands.The 243 seats will now be divided among eight parties -- Rashtriya Janata Dal, Congress, CPI, CPM, VIP, LJP (Paras) and JMM.“Two more parties are expected to be part of the INDIA bloc soon and we all have to sacrifice our share of seats to accommodate the new partners.” State Congress president Rajesh Kumar told reporters after a discussion during a key meeting of INDIA bloc leaders at the official residence of RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav.Meanwhile, Congress insist that it cannot go below the 70 seats.VIP chief Mukesh Sahani, on the other hand, has demanded “60 seats plus the post of deputy CM” while the CPI-ML is pressing for at least 40 seats, pointing to its past performance.The RJD is also unwilling to contest on fewer than 150 seats.In 2020 assembly elections, Rashtriya Janata Dal had contested on 144 seats, of which it won 75.Congress won 19 out of 70 seats.CPI-ML contested 19 seats and won 12.CPM contested 4 seats and was successful in winning 2 seats.CPI contested on 6 seats and won 2 seats.RJD's Tejashwi Yadav has already declared himself as the CM face of the opposition INDIA bloc.Addressing the rally in Ara town, the last stopover of the 'Voter Adhikar Yatra', Tejashwi questioned the Nitish Kumar government in Bihar for ""frequently copying his ideas"" and described it as a ""copycat government"". Ridiculing the government for copying his ideas, he said that at present he was moving ahead while the govt was behind him.""Tejashwi aage-aage, Sarkar pichhe-pichhe. Original CM chahiye ki duplicate?"" (Tejashwi is moving ahead while the govt is following him from behind. Do you want a duplicate CM or the original CM?), Tejashwi asked the crowd.","Two new parties - Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and Pashupati Paras's LJP faction - joined the Mahagathbandhan alliance.
