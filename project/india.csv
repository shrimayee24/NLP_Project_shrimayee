"Allu Arjun told about stampede death, didn't leave: Cops",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/allu-arjun-told-about-stampede-death-didnt-leave-cops/articleshow/116576623.cms,"Congress netas snipe at Allu, BJP claims conspiracy



HYDERABAD: A day after Telangana CM A Revanth Reddy launched a scathing attack on Allu Arjun over the Dec 4 stampede at the premiere of his film, ' Pushpa 2: The Rule ', Hyderabad police alleged Sunday that the actor insisted on sitting through the show even after being told that a woman had died in the crush outside.The stampede at Sandhya Theatre left 39-year-old Revathi dead and her minor son severely injured. Arrested and granted bail, the actor claimed at a presser Saturday that no cop had asked him to leave the theatre. He called it ""character assassination by spreading misinformation"".Despite being briefed about the situation outside, the actor refused to leave the theatre. He was adamant on watching the entire film. We not only told him about the fatality but also assured to clear the road outside for him to leave as he is a celebrity. Even then he refused to leave. It was only after the DCP stormed inside and gave him a deadline of 15 minutes to clear out, did he budge from there,” ACP L Ramesh Kumar said Sunday at a presser with colleagues.Telangana DGP in-charge Jitender emphasised that public safety supersedes film promotion. “With regard to Allu Arjun, we have nothing against any individual. At the same time everyone should be responsible towards the state. They should understand that safety and security of citizens is of utmost importance. They are heroes in films but on ground they should understand the problems of society. Promotion of films is not as important as the safety of citizens.” Jitender said.City police chief CV Anand released a 6.5-minute video to chronicle sequence of events that unfolded on Dec 4, with some visuals purportedly showing the actor being escorted out of theatre by cops.B Raju Naik, SHO of Chikkadpally area in which the theatre falls, also addressed the presser, echoing his senior colleagues and asserting that the crowd was “out of control”. “I somehow managed to escape death. But for the past 15 days, the fact that one woman (Revathi) died in my hands, and that we could not save her, has been haunting me. I pray for the soul and speedy recovery of her child,” Naik said, fighting back tears.As Revanth defended cops, some of the CM’s Congress colleagues insinuated Sunday that Allu had lacked empathy for the stampede victims and urged him to behave like “a real hero, not a reel hero”.“How can he prioritise box office collections over public safety? The actor should be a role model both on and off the screen,” said Congress MP Chamala Kiran Kumar Reddy. Congress MLC Balmoori Venkat questioned Allu’s statements that he and the film brought pride to Telugu people. However, CM Revanth’s rivals slammed his criticism of Allu in the assembly Saturday. Junior Union home minister Bandi Sanjay accused the Congress govt of collaborating with AIMIM to target Tollywood as part of a “calculated conspiracy”.Sanjay pointed out that Allu had informed the cops beforehand and blamed the govt for the chaos. “An AIMIM member was prompted to raise a scripted question in the assembly, weaving a narrative like a movie plot to reignite this issue. This is shameful,” Sanjay said in a statement, referring to AIMIM’s MLA Akbaruddin Owaisi and his tirade against Allu.",Telangana CM A Revanth Reddy launched a scathing attack on Allu Arjun over the Dec 4 stampede at the premiere of his film.

i tells

TOI’s Subodh Ghildiyal

. Excerpts from the interview:

How do you see the winter session?

INDIA bloc unity seems to be fraying. Many allies did not agree with Congress focus on Adani.

Congress was gung-ho after Lok Sabha polls, but much seems to have changed after the defeats in Maharashtra and Haryana.

About the LS numbers not changing over five years, the speculation is that Maharashtra allies NCP and Shiv Sena could switch sides.

The opposition managed to raise the questions it wanted - Adani indictment and role of Sebi chief, Manipur, farmers demand for support price, railways, erosion of autonomy of law enforcement institutions. Govt evaded all questions.The fact that the govt had no reply on Adani showed it was on the backfoot on this matter and is hiding something. Sometimes, we will have difference of opinion, which is normal. When we were protesting over Adani, many allies took part in our protest outside the House. And when we protested against home minister Amit Shah, everybody participated on all days. There are bound to be differences on select issues and yet, we maintained a healthy relationship.There are many state elections to be fought and there will be victories and defeats. But the numbers inside Parliament will not change, and we saw the govt barely scrape through on the introduction of the bill on 'simultaneous elections'. If we had some more people there, we could have blocked it. The results of the state elections over five years will not change the distribution of numbers inside LS.This question is not worth answering. We are united and serious about questioning the partisan role of the Election Commission, the voters' list and the way the poll officers are appointed. I think the Maharashtra elections pose very serious questions about the faith of voters in the integrity of the EC.","The opposition managed to raise the questions it wanted - Adani indictment and role of Sebi chief, Manipur, farmers demand for support price, railways, erosion of autonomy of law enforcement institutions.

The BJP leader also alleged negligence by the police, who he said had not yet registered a complaint or a zero FIR yet.""Police brought me to Khanapura police station around 8 pm. They didn't tell me in which case they brought me. They're not registering my complaint, they're not even filing zero FIR,"" CT Ravi said in a video released by news agency ANI.The BJP leader further claimed that there was a conspiracy hatched to murder him and said the ruling Congress government in Karnataka will be responsible. ""If something happens to me, Congress government must take responsibility. By registering a false case, they're conspiring to murder me,"" he said.The incident followed the arrest of former minister Ravi on Thursday from the Suvarna Vidhana Soudha premises. He was charged with making derogatory remarks against Karnataka’s women and child development minister, Laxmi Hebbalkar. Initially detained at the premises, Ravi was transported in a police van to a nearby station and later moved to Khanapur station, located 25 kilometers away.""It's been 3 hours since I was brought to the police station, and I haven't been told why I have been brought to the police station.

"Ambedkar row turns physical; BJP, Congress trade accusations",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ambedkar-row-turns-physical-bjp-congress-trade-accusations/articleshow/116481958.cms,"No one’s admitting guilt. Parties blame each other for clash



NEW DELHI: The confrontation in Parliament over Ambedkar took an ugly turn Thursday as BJP and Congress MPs came face to face at the entrance of the new Parliament while accusing each other of insulting the Dalit icon.BJP's Lok Sabha MP Pratap Sarangi suffered a cut on his forehead and was taken to hospital along with colleague Mukesh Rajput. Both accused leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi of shoving his way through BJP MPs standing at the main entrance, Makar Dwar.Later, both sides filed complaints against each other. PTI reported, quoting sources, that LS Speaker Om Birla had banned demonstrations at any of the Parliament gates.The scuffle happened minutes before 11am when the two Houses were to gather for what would have been another stormy round. A big group of BJP MPs had gathered at the entrance to protest against Congress's alleged insult of Ambedkar. As Rahul reached, he decided to walk through the saffron column.Soon, Sarangi was seen tumbling and bleeding. He was also hurt in the knee. The 70-year-old MP from Balasore in Odisha, and his colleagues, said he suffered the injury after Rahul shoved Rajput who was standing next to him, bringing both of them down.Kya Rahul, kya? Aap ko sharam nahin aati hai, budhe ko gira diya (What Rahul, are you not ashamed of what you have done to an elderly member)?” BJP MP Nishikant Dubey was heard repeatedly shouting at Rahul as the Congress MP paused to look at Sarangi and Rajput.“What happened? I did not push him, he pushed me,” Rahul replied.Amid the welter of allegations and counter-allegations, Sarangi with a bleeding temple, and Rajput were rushed to RML Hospital. As doctors stitched Sarangi’s wound and ran a series of scans on him, defence minister Rajnath Singh and agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and others visited the hospital to check on them. PM Modi spoke with the two MPs. In a statement, RML Hospital said Sarangi was profusely bleeding when he was brought in.With BJP accusing Rahul of physical violence and goonish behaviour, Congress members wrote to LS Speaker Om Birla alleging that the LoP had been manhandled by three BJP MPs.They also alleged that BJP MPs had shoved party chief Mallikarjun Kharge.Ministers and BJP MPs, however, pressed with the charge that Rahul was the instigator. They said that faced with similar protests from Congress MPs who have been regularly blocking the entrance on a range of issues for years, BJP parliamentarians would take the passage created by security personnel to help them sidestep the opposition MPs.At a press conference later, Kharge said BJP was trying to divert attention from home minister Amit Shah’s remarks on Ambedkar.Both Houses were adjourned soon after they assembled, and then again at 2pm for the day when Congress and other opposition parties continued their protest demanding an apology and resignation of home minister Amit Shah.Speaking to reporters, parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju said, “BJP MPs were protesting outside the Parliament gate where Rahul Gandhi with a few of his MPs physically assaulted them, who were peacefully protesting against falsehoods being spread against Amit Shah on the Ambedkar issue.”He said the entire incident was recorded on CCTV cameras and everyone saw that Rahul physically attacked NDA MPs.","BJP's Lok Sabha MP Pratap Sarangi suffered a cut on his forehead and was taken to hospital along with colleague Mukesh Rajput.
