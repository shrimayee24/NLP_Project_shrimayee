The AAP MPs, holding placards with slogans such as ""Stop misusing ED and CBI"" and ""Dictatorship will not work"", announced their decision to boycott the President's address to the joint sitting of Parliament, marking this as the first presidential address following the formation of the third National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government.AAP leader Sandeep Pathak emphasized the significance of protesting against what they deem to be dictatorial actions under the guise of justice.He stated, ""The President and the Constitution are supreme and when dictatorship is done in the name of justice, it is important to raise voices."" He added that the party would express their dissent in the Rajya Sabha .""Today we will protest in the Rajya Sabha against the arrest of Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and we will boycott the President's address. The President and the Constitution are supreme and when dictatorship is done in the name of justice, it is important to raise our voices,"" Pathak highlighted.Pathak clarified that the decision to protest was taken independently by AAP without coordinating with other parties in the INDIA alliance. ""We did not have a discussion with the remaining parties of the INDIA alliance regarding this but our party will boycott the President's address,"" he said.The Rouse Avenue Court of Delhi on Wednesday ordered Kejriwal to three days of CBI remand related to the Excise policy case . Vacation Judge Amitabh Rawat, after considering the arguments from both sides, permitted Kejriwal's CBI remand until June 29, 2024.During the remand, Kejriwal's wife, Sunita Kejriwal, will be allowed to meet him for 30 minutes daily, and his lawyer will also have daily 30-minute meetings. Additionally, Kejriwal can carry his prescribed medicines throughout the remand period.During the court hearing, Kejriwal defended himself, arguing that the accusations against him were fabricated and intended to tarnish his reputation and that of his party. He said, ""CBI is claiming that I have made a statement against Manish Sisodia, which is completely false. Manish Sisodia Nirdosh hai, Aam Aadmi Party Nirdosh hai. Main bhi nirdosh hun. Iss Tarah ke statements hamme media me badnam Karne ke liye diye ja rahe hai.""He further emphasized the perceived media manipulation. ""CBI sources ke hawale se media me hamme badnam kar rahe rahe hai.

The High Court stated that the trial court should have recorded its satisfaction regarding the fulfillment of the twin conditions of Section 45 of the Prevention of the Money Laundering Act (PMLA) before deciding.The motion of thanks following the President's address will be moved in both Houses of Parliament and discussed by the members.

As Tharoor walked off after shaking hands with Birla, the Speaker said, ""He is already taking oath on the Constitution.""Soon after this remark, a few members of the opposition started to contradict him while Deepender Hooda stood up from his seat to say the Speaker should not be objecting to this.""Don't give me advice on what I should or should not object to.

'He will not in future ...': Why Congress reinstated Sam Pitroda,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/he-will-not-in-future-why-congress-reinstated-sam-pitroda/articleshow/111320362.cms,"So, what forced Pitroda's 'temporary separation' from the Congress?

What has changed for Congress to reinstate Pitroda?

Why is Sam Pitroda important for Congress?

'PM Modi had already predicted Pitroda's reinstatement'

Pitroda's past controversies

On Ram Mandir

On 1984 anti-Sikh riots

On Pulwama attack

Nehru vs Ambedkar on Constitution

NEW DELHI: Sam Pitroda , who has a penchant for stoking controversies, is back as chairman of the Indian Overseas Congress , less than two months after he quit the post in the middle of Lok Sabha elections with ""mutual consent"" over remarks that were ""totally unacceptable to the Congress.""""Congress president has reappointed Sam Pitroda as chairman of the Indian Overseas Congress with immediate effect,"" AICC general secretary K C Venugopal said in a statement on Wednesday.Party general secretary Jairam Ramesh said that Pitroda was reappointed Indian Overseas Congress chief after he clarified the context in which the controversial statements were made.Well, it was a remark that had the potential to harm the grand old party's electoral prospects. Pitroda during a podcast cited ethnic and racial identities like Chinese, Africans, Arabs and Whites to describe the physical appearance of Indians from different parts of the country.In the podcast, Pitroda had said, ""We have survived 75 years in a very happy environment where people could live together, leaving aside a few fights here and there.""""We could hold a country as diverse as India together. Where people in the east look like the Chinese, people in the west look like the Arabs, people in the north look like, maybe, white and people in the south look like Africans.""It does not matter. All of us are brothers and sisters. We respect different languages, different religions, different customs, different food,"" he had said.The BJP was quick to make this a poll issue. Prime Minister Narendra Modi led the BJP's attack on Pitroda's analogy and slammed his comments as ""racist"". He asserted that people will not tolerate the attempt to insult them on the basis of their skin colour.At his rallies in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, Modi had said he is livid with the racial profiling of Indians by the US-based ""philosopher and uncle of 'Shehzada'"", and linked the Congress' opposition to Droupadi Murmu's presidential bid to its mindset, which saw her as an ""African"" because of her dark skin.With PM Modi 's focus on south outreach, the Congress was quick to distance itself from Pitroda's remarks and called it ""completely unacceptable.""Unfortunately for the Congress , this was not the first but the second controversy stoked by Pitroda.His remarks on the concept of inheritance tax in the United States while discussing the Congress' Lok Sabha poll manifesto gave the ruling BJP a potent handle to accuse the opposition party of eying citizens' assets as part of its ""redistribution of wealth"" policy.This came at a time when the Congress was trying hard to counter Prime Minister Modi's relentless attack over its manifesto pitch on socio-economic and caste survey and redistribution of resources.PM Modi attacked Congress with a popular tag line of LIC and said ""zindagi ke saath bhi, zindagi ke baad bhi"" is the opposition party's mantra to ""loot"" people. In his poll rallies, PM Modi used Pitroda's comments to assert that it has exposed Congress's hidden agenda and that the party has become so removed from the country's social and family values that it wants to legally rob people of their assets and lifelong savings they want to bequeath to their children.The Congress was again quick to clarify that Pitroda's views were not the official views of the party.Well, nothing except that elections are now over so perhaps there is no fear of electoral damage to the Congress in the near future. The party has blamed the BJP for distorting Pitroda's statement to reap electoral gains.Pitroda has given an assurance not to leave room for such controversies in future. ""He has clarified the context in which statements were made and how they were later distorted by the Modi campaign. The Congress president has reappointed him on the assurance that he will not in future leave room for such controversies to arise,"" Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said in a post on X.The veteran leader was an advisor to former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. He has been closely associated with Rahul Gandhi, accompanying him during his foreign visits. Pitroda has also arranged several interactions of Rahul with students of foreign universities in the UK, the UAE and the US.The BJP reacted sharply to Congress move and said that the grand old party kept a distance from Sam Pitroda during the Lok Sabha elections just to deceive the public.""The first thing Rahul Gandhi did as soon as he became the leader of the opposition was to become the leader of hypocrisy and leader of opportunism...One thing is clear from this that the cosmetic distance that the Congress party had made from Sam Pitroda during the elections was only and only a pretence, it was a lie, and it was to deceive the public,"" said BJP leader Shehzad Poonawalla.Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju took a jibe at the Congress and said Prime Minister Modi Ji had already predicted this development.Sharing a post on X, the Union Minister wrote, ""Prime Minister Modi ji has already said! Rahul Gandhi Ji's adviser who said, South Indians look like Africans, North-Eastern people look Chinese, West Indians are like Arabs & North Indian are whites is reinstated. We are not surprised as PM @narendramodi ji had predicted.""Along with the text, the Union Minister also shared an old video of Prime Minister Modi in which he said that Sam Pitroda doesn't give controversial statements by chance, rather, it's the Congress party's strategy to create new issues in the country.The PM had then said, ""I don't think he does it by his choice, as after his controversial statements, he is suspended from the party, and after some days, he is again seen in the mainstream works of the party. It's a well-known strategy of the Congress party to create confusion, change the environment, and add new issues to the nation. So, they play some tactics from time to time.""In June 2023, Pitroda gave the BJP ammunition to attack the Congress as he said that temples were not going to solve India’s problems of unemployment, inflation, education, and health. ""No one talks about these things. But everyone talks about Ram, Hanuman, and Mandir. I have said that temples are not going to create jobs,"" he had said then.In May 2019, Pitroda had said ""hua to hua"" (so what) when he was asked about the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. ""Ab kya hai '84 ka? Aapne kya kiya 5 saal mein, uski baat kariye. ’84 mein hua to hua. You were voted to create jobs. You were voted to create 200 smart cities. Aapne wo bhi nahi kiya. Aapne kuch nahi kiya isliye aap yahan wahan gup lagate hain',"" Pitroda had then said.In February 2019, Pitroda kicked up a storm as he raised questions on Balakot air strikes by the Indian Air Force which were carried out in retaliation to the Pulwama attacks. ""I don’t know much about attacks. It happens all the time. The attack happened in Mumbai, also. We could have then reacted and just sent our planes, but that is not the right approach. According to me, that’s not how you deal with the world,"" Pitroda had said.Pitroda had in April 2019 cited an article by Sudheendra Kulkarni, a former close aide of BJP veteran LK Advani, and claimed that India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, contributed more than BR Ambedkar in the framing of the Constitution. Pitroda later deleted the post.Pitroda is now back with the Congress. Will he be more careful with his remarks as he has promised or will he embarrass the grand old party again? Well, we will have to wait for the next round of elections due later this year.(With inputs from agencies)","Sam Pitroda is back as chairman of the Indian Overseas Congress.

MSCB scam: EOW opposes ED claims on Ajit Pawar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mscb-scam-eow-opposes-ed-claims-on-ajit-pawar/articleshow/111323939.cms,"MUMBAI: Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the Mumbai Police, in its reply to the court, objected to Enforcement Directorate (ED)'s claim that Maharashtra State Co-Operative Bank (MSCB) office bearers, including NCP leader and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar , had committed cheating while auctioning the sick sugar mills at throwaway prices to their kin.Submitting that ED had no right to file an intervention plea despite an earlier one being rejected by the court, EOW filed its reply against the application which opposed the closure report by EOW in the Rs 25,000-crore MSCB scam . EOW said even after further investigations were conducted, it was found that no cognizable offence had been committed. Hence, the closure report was submitted.The development comes days after an article in the RSS organ 'Organiser' attributed BJP's poor performance in LS polls in state to its alliance with Ajit Pawar, and amid reports of state BJP and Shiv Sena functionaries urging their netas to 'remove NCP from the Mahayuti'.The Rs 25,000 crore MSCB scam case highlights the alleged irregularities in auctioning of sick sugar mills by MSCB, which was reportedly controlled by senior politicians who allegedly benefited from auctioning of these mills to their kin. ED had alleged cheating, misconduct, and money laundering in the auctioning of the four sick mills and linked the suspicious transactions with Ajit Pawar, his wife Sunetra Pawar, Shiv Sena's Arjun Khotkar, and companies of NCP (SP) leaders Rohit Pawar and Prajakt Tanpure.ED informed the court that it had shared its findings with EOW and stated that it is an affected party as their money laundering case is based on EOW's FIR in the scam that was registered on Bombay HC's directions. In response, EOW submitted its reply in the court recently stating that the court had earlier rejected the ED's similar intervention application.","Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the Mumbai Police objected to Enforcement Directorate (ED)'s claim that Maharashtra State Co-Operative Bank (MSCB) office bearers committed cheating.

Congress's invocation of Constitution a masquerade: BJP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congresss-invocation-of-constitution-a-masquerade-bjp/articleshow/111323369.cms,"NEW DELHI: BJP on Thursday attacked Congress for objecting to Speaker Om Birla's condemnation of the Emergency , claiming that this shows the opposition party's intentions are not right and its invocation of the Constitution is merely a smokescreen.Former Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said Congress begins squirming at the mention of Emergency, which was imposed by the then PM Indira Gandhi in 1975.Referring to the Emergency as ""the sin of murder of democracy"", he asked, ""Why should not this black chapter in the Indian democracy be discussed.""He noted that Congress never apologised for the Emergency. Taking a swipe at its current allies like Akhilesh Yadav , M K Stalin and Tejashwi Yadav, he said they should remember the excesses of Emergency.Prasad's remarks came after LoP Rahul Gandhi met Birla and voiced his displeasure over his critical statement Wednesday in the House on Emergency. Gandhi claimed it was ""clearly political"" & could have been avoided. Defending Birla's stand, Prasad said it is necessary to tell the country why it was imposed.President Droupadi Murmu also condemned the Emergency in her address to a joint sitting of the Parliament on Thursday.The BJP neta noted that opposition leaders were arrested, RSS activists were tortured, thousands of people were forced to undergo vasectomy and media was put under censorship among the Emergency's numerous excesses. While the DMK govt in Tamil Nadu was dismissed, Tejashwi Yadav's father and former Bihar CM Lalu Prasad Yadav was arrested. Akhilesh's father Mulayam Singh Yadav was also imprisoned.Congress functionaries are carrying copies of the Constitution and it is clearly a smokescreen, Prasad claimed.

Congress, along with the rest of the opposition , also punched holes over the govt's claims including on the economy and women empowerment.In a stinging criticism of the Prez's address, Kharge said the speech was silent on paper leaks, backbreaking price rise , violence in Manipur, train accidents, terror attacks in J&K, and rising atrocities against SC/ST/minorities in BJP-governed states. ""Modi is making a futile attempt to garner some applause by making the Honourable President read lies, which the people of India have rejected in the 2024 polls,"" he said.SP chief Akhilesh Yadav said, ""The story that is being told about India becoming the fifth-largest economy... has it made our farmers prosperous? If we are the fifth-largest economy, then why are so many youths unemployed? Why is there a scheme like Agniveer? Why can't price rise be controlled?""

This address was full of lies.""AAP boycotted the joint address against the ""misuse of agencies"" and arrest of Arvind Kejriwal ahead of his bail hearing, and held a protest in the Parliament complex.Kharge said Modi's election speeches confirmed that BJP/RSS stood for social division, and BJP-ruled Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Assam and UP have witnessed rising incidents of mob lynching, communal violence and illegal ""Bulldozer Justice"" against the poor after Modi's coming to power. ""The governing party cannot maintain a stoic silence on this,"" he said.Kharge accused the govt of trying to ""whitewash NEET scam "", stating that 12 of the 66 recruitment exams by NTA in last five years have witnessed serious rigging and paper leaks, affecting 75 lakh youth. ""Modi govt cannot run away from its responsibility by just simply saying that 'we should rise above partisan politics' when every second youth is unemployed,"" he said.He said prices of essential food items have skyrocketed with food inflation over 8.5% for four months, but the word ""inflation"" was missing from the speech.

BJP is the new 'Congress' for Akali Dal in Punjab politics,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/bjp-is-the-new-congress-for-akali-dal-in-punjab-politics/articleshow/111302557.cms,"JALANDHAR: Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) appears to have become the new Congress for Akali politics in Punjab. Though Akali Dal and Congress were main adversaries in Punjab after Partition, following the tumultuous events of 1984 there was a very strong sentiment against Congress and it was often called the enemy of Sikhs. The labels of 'Congress agent' or 'B team of Congress' were used by the competitors within Sikh political space against each other.Former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal was the most deft and frequent user of these labels and any dissenter in Shiromani Akali Dal was labelled 'B team of Congress'.His camp used this label even for the late Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) president Gurcharan Singh Tohra and his associates when they sparred with Badal Senior. IPS officer-turned-Akali politician Simranjit Singh Mann was attacked with the same label by Badal Senior's camp and this label was even used for those in the radical camp at different times, sometimes subtly and at others openly.After Congress was badly thrashed and thrown out of power in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the Badals started missing the 'enemy' at the Centre. The concept of Congress as 'enemy' was vital to their politics and rhetoric and it also helped them to provide cover to their deviations from the earlier stated positions and policies of the Akali Dal on a few crucial issues. Though the Badals shared power at the Centre for over six years as part of NDA till the farm movement forced them to sever ties with BJP, Congress as the 'main enemy of Panth and Punjab' remained central to their political rhetoric.Even after ending 25-year-old alliance with BJP in 2020, the Badals and other Akali leaders, barring a few occasions including in their speeches in Parliament, did not attack or criticise BJP much as the possibility of coming together again had not been ruled out yet. Opening of channels before the 2024 elections between SAD and BJP was confirmed by Union home minister Amit Shah himself but after SAD laid conditions for the alliance and BJP announced its decision to contest elections on its own in Punjab by turning to aggressive campaigning, both sides hardened their positions.After that, SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal repeatedly started mentioning how RSS had taken control of gurdwara bodies outside Punjab. He also time and again attacked communal politics being played in the country, referring to BJP by implication.That the larger Sikh community remains apprehensive about BJP is clear from the voting pattern in Punjab for the Lok Sabha elections as the community strategically voted to block the saffron party and Congress became its biggest beneficiary in the state.Sukhbir's allegations that BJP was sponsoring his detractors within the Sikh political space seem to resonate given the examples of Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee and Haryana State Gurdwara Management Committee. DSGMC remains the biggest example of Sukhbir's loyalist SAD leaders shifting loyalty to the BJP.The BJP has now replaced Congress in the labels such as ""agents"" and ""B team"" used by the Badal camp as they know well that, true or false, projecting this perception will help them counter their detractors amongst the Sikh community.The irony remains that they are deftly using these after extending unconditional support to BJP for close to 25 years even if that meant complete reversal of Akali Dal's stated positions or policies on a few issues. The long alliance also helped the saffron party to expand its base in Punjab.","After Partition, there was a very strong sentiment against Congress and it was often called the enemy of Sikhs. The labels of 'Congress agent' or 'B team of Congress' were used by the competitors within Sikh political space against each other. The concept of Congress as 'enemy' was vital to their politics and rhetoric.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111302617,imgsize-38732,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/111302617.jpg"
Video: Uddhav Thackeray's 'secret' meeting with Devendra Fadnavis in lift,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/video-uddhav-thackerays-accidental-meeting-with-devendra-fadnavis-in-lift/articleshow/111317900.cms,"NEW DELHI: An accidental meeting between Maharashtra deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray in Vidhan Bhawan has sent ripples across in state's political affairs. The two leader bumped into each other while waiting for a lift at Vidhan Bhawan on the first day of state legislature monsoon session.A viral video showed the two leaders standing together and having a brief conversation.When asked about the conversation, Thackeray said, ""People must have thought of the song, 'na na karte pyar tumhi se kar baithe' (I fell in love with you despite denials). But no such thing will happen.""Thackeray, on a lighter note, added that lifts don't have ears so it is a good suggestion to have such meetings in lifts in future.Though the former BJP ally stated that nothing else was to be inferred from the lift encounter as it was an ""unexpected meeting"".BJP legislator Pravin Darekar, who was also in the lift, said, ""When the lift doors opened, Fadnavis walked towards the side of the ruling party offices and Uddhav ji walked to the opposition party offices. This means he (Uddhav) has no intention of joining the ruling benches.""Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Shirsat said the meeting between Thackeray and Fadnavis showed there can be political differences but no animosity. Talking to reporters in the Vidhan Bhavan premises, Shirsat, an MLA, said fights can be political but personal ties should not break. ""You can understand the meaning of this (meeting) that we don't have personal fights. Uddhav saheb must have realised that he is being misguided by the ones like Sanjay Raut (Sena UBT MP). There should be differences but no animosity. This is an example of that,"" emphasised Shirsat.Recently, Maharashtra chief minister Eknath Shinde claimed that after assembly election results in 2019, Fadnavis tried to contact Thackeray 50 times to discuss the sharing of the CM’s term for 2.5 years each by the Sena and BJP but Thackeray did not take his calls. CM Shinde said Thackeray told him that he would not go ahead with BJP as he did not trust them anymore.Of the 48 Lok Sabha seats in Maharashtra, the ruling alliance won 17, while the opposition MVA combine of the Congress, NCP (Sharadchandra Pawar) and Shiv Sena (UBT) bagged 30.",The two leader bumped into each other while waiting for a lift at Vidhan Bhawan.
