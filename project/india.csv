PM, Shah to join Constitution debat

NEW DELHI: Parliament is set to hold a discussion on the Constitution of India in the backdrop of the 75th anniversary of its adoption, but the landmark event may see the rivals using the stage to target each other instead.Leader of the opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi met Speaker Om Birla Wednesday and urged that the House should function and the December 13-14 discussion on Constitution should not fall prey to disruptions by BJP. The governing party said its intent was evident from the fact that dates were fixed in the two Houses with the idea of holding the discussion.It added that PM Modi would reply to the debate in Lok Sabha, and home minister Amit Shah would initiate the debate in Rajya Sabha on December 16.But the general belief is that the bitterness may result in the Constitution being reduced to a cover the rivals will use to corner each other with their political agenda.There was a hint of what is to come in Rahul's remarks to reporters on Wednesday when asked about disruptions and BJP's allegations about Congress's links to George Soros. ""There is a commitment for debate on the Constitution on Dec 13. They can level any allegation against me, but it should happen. Govt does not want a discussion on Adani and they want to distract. But in the end, we will not spare them,"" Rahul said.With the two Houses having witnessed continuous disruption in the ongoing session in the wake of the govt's refusal to take up the Adani indictment, the debate on the Constitution presents the opposition with a readymade stage to try to embarrass govt and Modi. Issues such as caste census, removal of 50% cap on reservations, BJP's ""controlling"" of constitutional bodies, Manipur crisis, Places of Worship Act and incidents like Sambhal, communalism and bias against opposition-governed states are other subjects likely to dominate the speeches of Congress and the opposition.BJP is set to raise the issues of suspension of democracy by the Congress govt led by Indira Gandhi as well as efforts of non-BJP govts to roll out quotas for Muslims. It may retaliate against Congress's attack by creating openings to push its allegation that billionaire George Soros and Congress, including its representatives Sonia Gandhi and Rahul, had combined with ""anti-India"" forces. BJP has alleged Sonia had links to Forum of Democratic Leaders-Asia Pacific (FDL-AP) Foundation, an organisation financed by George Soros Foundation, which has backed the idea of Kashmir as an independent nation.Sources in Congress said the party's charge will be led by Rahul. It will also check with Priyanka Gandhi Vadra for second speaker, while it has the likes of Gaurav Gogoi, Shashi Tharoor, Manish Tewari among others. SP's Akhilesh Yadav is another major face in opposition camp who would use the national platform to send out a signal to the electorate in UP. Modi's reply to the debate will be designed to answer the opposition's political offensive and he is adept at cashing in on the privilege of having the last word.The 2024 LS poll results gave opposition a boost, but BJP's victories in Haryana and Maharashtra have neutralised much of anti-BJP camp's momentum. The debate may set the trajectory of the battle going forward.",Parliament is set to hold a discussion on the Constitution of India in the backdrop of the 75th anniversary of its adoption. The general belief is that the bitterness may result in the Constitution being reduced to a cover the rivals will use to corner each other with their political agenda.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116228094,imgsize-1874945,width-400,resizemode-4/116228094.jpg"
INDIA bloc divided: Can Congress prevent another Delhi rout after Kejriwal says no to alliance?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-bloc-divided-can-congress-prevent-another-delhi-rout-after-kejriwal-says-no-to-alliance/articleshow/116220724.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Congress , already weakened by its losses in Haryana and Maharashtra, faces a tough start to 2025 with Arvind Kejriwal 's Aam Aadmi Party ruling out any alliance with the grand old party for the Delhi assembly elections to be held early next year.On Wednesday, Kejriwal took to X to reiterate that Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) will be fighting the election on its own strength in Delhi. ""There is no possibility of any alliance with the Congress,"" the former Delhi chief minister said in a post.In a tit-for-tat response, Delhi Congress chief Devender Yadav also said that his party will go solo in the polls as it is in a very strong position to win the contest. Yadav claimed the Congress had to pay a heavy price for aligning with the Kejriwal-led outfit in the Lok Sabha election held earlier in the year.The AAP and the Congress had fought the 2024 Lok Sabha elections in Delhi together earlier this year under the INDIA banner but lost on all the seven seats against the BJP.AAP's announcement was on expected lines especially after the snub Kejriwal's party got in Haryana earlier this year at the hands of the Congress. The two parties failed to reach seat-sharing agreement in Haryana despite several rounds of talks as an overconfident state Congress leadership led by Bhupinder Singh Hooda was not willing to accommodate the demands of AAP.AAP leader Raghav Chadha, who headed the Haryana talks as Arvind Kejriwal was then in jail, was absolutely categorical in rubbishing reports of alliance.""I am making it clear that AAP will contest the upcoming Delhi Assembly elections on its own strength. There is no question of any alliance. The reports of any kind of alliance between AAP and Congress are baseless. The AAP has won the last three Delhi elections alone, on its own. Fourth time also, when there will be Assembly elections in 2025, AAP will contest based on its work and Arvind Kejriwal's name, and win. There is no chance of alliance,"" Raghav Chadda said.The Delhi Congress unit, which has always opposed any tie-up with AAP, would be happy with the prospect of contesting the 2025 assembly elections on its own. However, the fact remains that the grand old party has been on the path of steep decline in Delhi and contesting the elections on its own will be a huge challenge for the party leadership.In the last two assembly elections, the Congress was completely decimated in Delhi as it even failed to open its account. In the 2015 and 2020 assembly polls, the AAP won 67 and 62 seats and the BJP won three and eight seats respectively. The Congress scored two consecutive zeroes in these elections.Not just that, the party's vote share which was at 48.1% in 2003 has seen a sharp dip to 4.3% in 2020. in 2013 when the Congress had won 8 seats it had a vote share of 24.6%. However, that came down to around 10% in 2015. A look at the comparative performance of the two parties shows that AAP made massive gains in 2015 and 2020 at the cost of the Congress, while the BJP managed to improve its vote share despite not winning enough seats.The state Congress leaders have already started raising their pitch against the AAP government, which is at present headed by Atishi. The Delhi Congress chief claimed that during the month-long ""Delhi Nyay Yatra"" the feedback received from lakhs of people was that the party should go alone in the assembly polls.Yadav claimed that the AAP has lost credibility and the people's trust after its leaders -- Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, Satyender Jain and Sanjay Singh -- went to jail in connection with corruption and money-laundering cases.The Delhi Congress chief had also recently criticised AAP and its national convenor Arvind Kejriwal, for being responsible for the ""deteriorating"" law and order situation in the national capital.Yadav also demanded that Kejriwal should ask for the resignation of Delhi chief minister Atishi, the same way he asked for the resignation of former CM Sheila Dixit during the Nirbhaya case.The Delhi Congress president further alleged that the women are facing the brunt of increasing crimes, including gang wars, firing, murder, rape, harassment and snatching incidents.These attacks notwithstanding, the road ahead is likely to be very difficult for the Congress. It will be a Herculean task for the party leadership to reclaim the lost ground in Delhi. With the party already under all-round attack within the INDIA bloc over its electoral failures, another dismal show will add to the pressure it faces. Perhaps, a joint contest with AAP may have helped it win some seats and prevent another possible decimation.(With inputs from agencies)",Aam Aadmi Party rules out any alliance with the grand old party for the Delhi assembly elections to be held early next year.

LUCKNOW: The family of Nikita Singhania , estranged wife of Bengaluru-based automobile executive Subhash Atul , denied Wednesday any involvement in his death by suicide two day ago. Atul, 34, left behind a 24-page suicide note and an 81-minute video alleging harassment from his wife and in-laws amid a contentious legal battle over divorce and child custody in a Jaunpur family court in UP.Nikita's paternal uncle Sushil Singhania said in Jaunpur: ""Neither I nor any family member was present at the scene. The claims made in the video will be addressed by Nikita shortly.""He said the family had no contact with Atul in the last three years and expressed trust in the judiciary. ""We are not guilty, and we trust the court to deliver a fair judgment."" A complaint filed by Atul's brother Bikas Kumar accused Nikita and her family of demanding Rs 3 crore to withdraw police cases and Rs 30 lakh to grant visitation rights for Atul to see his four-year-old son. In the video, Atul is seen wearing a board around his neck that read ""Justice is Due"".Nikita's lawyer Vinod Srivastava defended the court's handling of the divorce and child custody case, stating that judicial officer Rita Kaushik acted within legal bounds. The civil court of Jaunpur ruled on the matter in July 2024, setting specific alimony for the couple's son.Nikita had filed an FIR on April 24, 2022, at Jaunpur Kotwali, accusing Atul, his parents Anju Devi and Pawan Modi, and younger brother Bikas of dowry harassment and violations under the Dowry Prohibition Act.The FIR alleged that after their marriage on April 26, 2019, in Varanasi, Atul's family demanded a dowry of Rs 10 lakh. It also claimed that on Aug 16, 2019, Atul's parents again demanded Rs 10 lakh, leading to Nikita's father's sudden death the next day.In his note, Atuldenied any link between the dowry demand and her father's death, asserting that he had long been ill and was treated at AIIMS Delhi before passing away in a local hospital.","Atul, 34, left behind a 24-page suicide note and an 81-minute video alleging harassment from his wife and in-laws.

Oppn steps up attack on Dhankhar, says he's the biggest disruptor of RS

NEW DELHI: A day after the opposition moved a notice to remove vice-president Jagdeep Dhankhar , who serves as Rajya Sabha chairman, Congress president and leader of opposition in RS Mallikarjun Kharge said the VP's ""commitment is not to the Constitution...but to the ruling party"".At a presser Wednesday by INDIA bloc of opposition parties, which was attended by the allies, Kharge said, ""Over the past three years his conduct is contrary to the dignity of the high office he holds. Sometimes he starts praising the govt and sometimes he starts calling himself Eklavya of RSS .""In RS, Dhankhar told opposition MPs he was aware of the notice against him. BJP and its allies rallied behind him and sought an apology from Kharge for ""insulting"" a ""son of the soil"".NEW DELHI: Alleging that ""the biggest disruptor of Rajya Sabha was its own chairman"", INDIA bloc on Wednesday stepped up its attack on Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar and said his ""biased and partisan conduct"" had forced the opposition alliance to bring a resolution seeking his removal.Members of the anti-BJP bloc led by the LoP in Rajya Sabha and Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge alleged that Chairman Dhankhar was ""strangulating the opposition's voice"" and was acting as the ""govt's spokesperson and shield"" with an eye on his ""next promotion"".""This is not just a breach of protocol, but a betrayal of the Constitution and the people of India,"" Kharge told reporters at a press conference, while clarifying that the notice for Dhankhar's removal was not about personal grievances or political battles. Opposition parties on Tuesday submitted the notice to the Rajya Sabha secretary general.Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, Rashtriya Janata Dal, Trinamool Congress, Samajwadi Party, Shiv Sena (UBT), NCP (Sharad Pawar), Jharkhand Mukti Morcha and CPI (M) members were among those who attended the press conference. No member of AAP, a key constituent of the alliance, was present, but Congress's Jairam Ramesh said AAP was very much part of this coming together, and five AAP leaders were signatories to the notice. AAP members had to skip the press conference as they had an appointment with Election Commission.""We are saddened that 75 years after the adoption of the Constitution, the biased and partisan conduct of the Chairman has forced the opposition to bring this resolution against him,"" Kharge said. He claimed that those who held the post previously were unbiased and stayed away from indulging in politics.He said, ""Over the past three years his conduct is contrary to the dignity of the high office he holds. Sometimes he starts praising the govt and sometimes he starts calling himself the Eklavya of RSS.""""His commitment is not to the Constitution and constitutional traditions, but to the governing party. He is working like the government's spokesperson,"" Kharge said. He went on to call Dhankhar as the ""biggest reason"" for disruptions in the House.""Normally the opposition seeks protection from the Chair as they see the person on the post as their protector. But if the chairman himself starts singing praises of the PM and governing party in that situation, who will listen to the opposition?"" Kharge asked.He alleged that Dhankhar resorts to schooling senior leaders and speaking down to them like a headmaster. The chairman never ""missed an opportunity to insult opposition leaders,"" Kharge said.Recalling incidents of Monday in the House to target Dhankhar, he said it was ""particularly troubling as it was marked by blatant partisanship and a total lack of fairness"". ""The Chairman openly encourages and provokes the treasury benches to make outrageous remarks against the opposition,"" Kharge said.On BJP claiming that the opposition parties don't have the numbers to get the resolution passed, Kharge said, ""let them first allow and admit the notice, then we will also muster the numbers"".DMK's Tiruchi Siva, RJD's Manoj Jha, TMC's Nadimul Haque, SP's Javed Ali Khan and Shiv Sena (UBT)'s Sanjay Raut also hit out Dhankhar and supported the notice against him, saying it was about ""about restoring of core principles of democracy"".","India bloc steps up attack on Dhankhar, says he's the biggest disruptor of RS.

""If you cannot respect the Chair, you have no right to be members of this House,"" he said. Nadda accused Congress of acting as a ""tool of external forces"".

The remarks led to treasury benches sparring with the opposition, and BJP MP Sandhya Ray, who was in the chair, adjourning proceedings till 2 pm.Raising the Manipur issue during zero hour, Gogoi said people of Manipur wanted to know when PM Modi would visit the state and when Shah would apprise the House of the steps required to resolve the situation.""The state is in a humanitarian crisis and instead of finding a solution, government is sending paramilitary forces and enforcing AFSPA.

Rahul's Adani focus, Congress unilateralism rile INDIA allies

NEW DELHI/PATNA: RJD chief Lalu Prasad on Tuesday endorsed Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee 's desire to take over the reins of INDIA bloc from Congress, days after Sharad Pawar too had backed her.""Congress's reservations (on this) amount to nothing. Mamata ko do (give her the leadership role),"" Lalu said.Congress, though, played down the issue. At a meeting with party MPs, leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi is learnt to have advised them to ignore what is seen by the party to be a ""media-manufactured"" issue and mere ""posturing"" by allies.Though Lalu supported Mamata's claim to lead the anti-BJP alliance , it may be recalled he had consistently backed Congress since the days when Sonia Gandhi was struggling to shake off the ""foreigner"" tag.Other allies of Congress, such as Shiv Sena (UBT) and SP , have made few bones of their reservations about Congress continuing to lead the opposition alliance despite having been consistently underwhelming in election contests since the LS polls where it significantly improved its tally.YSR Congress, which is not part of INDIA group, too reiterated support for Mamata, calling her the ""most capable leader to lead the bloc"".There have been palpable signs of uneasiness with Congress's unilateralism in deciding priorities of the alliance. Allies are also upset with Rahul's fixation with the Adani issue which, many feel, has deprived them of the opportunity to use Parliament to seek to corner govt on issues like inflation which, they maintain, resonate better with people. Congress's poor performance in Maharashtra, Haryana and J&K and its manifest inability to be competitive against BJP in direct contests have weakened its case to be the natural leader of the opposition alliance.Considering that INDIA bloc, despite having Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge as its president, is not a structured entity and does not have a secretariat or a programme of action agreed upon by all stakeholders, Mamata's claim appears to be a challenge to Congress's ""size matters"" assertion and to make the intra-alliance equations more symmetrical.Congress is not pleased and its annoyance with Lalu came to the fore, with Congress secretary Shahnawaz Alam saying the party deserved to lead the alliance by virtue of its sheer strength.""Lalu ji is known to say lots of things casually.
