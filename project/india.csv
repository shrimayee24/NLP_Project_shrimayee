The ADJ court also imposed a fine of Rs 71,000 on him.ADGC Manoj Sharma said the matter came to light after the survivor gathered courage and reached the local police station with her mother on May 3, 2019, to file a complaint against her father's conduct. Based on her complaint, an FIR was registered under IPC sections 376 (rape), 323 (voluntary causing hurt) and 506 (criminal intimidation). Pocso wasn't invoked in this case as the child was an adult at the time of complaint, the ADGC added.In her statement before the magistrate under section CrPC 164, she stated: ""When I was 12 (in 2012), my dad started raping me and married me off in April 2014 when I got pregnant and delivered a child. After marriage, when my father again tried to rape me, I couldn't take it anymore and filed a police complaint.""Police thereafter launched a probe, and based on technical evidence and the statements by the survivor, her mother and the doctors, a chargesheet was filed in Sept 2019.When the case reached the court, the man denied all the allegations and said he did not commit such a crime -- which his wife and other family members vehemently opposed. He also claimed his ""daughter had a premarital relationship with her husband, and the child was a result of that. ""The court of the additional district and sessions judge (fast track), Shyam Babu, however took the police investigation report, medical reports and all the testimonies into consideration and rejected the accused's plea.
