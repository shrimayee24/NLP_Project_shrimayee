PATNA: The INDIA bloc continues to grapple with mounting internal friction, which is beginning to derail its election campaign in Bihar as the filing of nomination papers for the second and final phase of closes on Monday. Some seats have witnessed INDIA bloc partners fielding candidates against each other and none of them withdrew their nominations even on Sunday. Meanwhile, the RJD and Congress have so far not stepped in to quell the dispute, sending a worrying signal to voters.In contrast, the NDA campaign is in full swing. Union minister Amit Shah has returned to Delhi after a three-day tour while union minister Dharmendra Pradhan is currently camping in Bihar. The chief ministers of Goa, Haryana and Tripura have addressed rallies in various parts of the state. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will launch his Bihar poll campaign from Samastipur on Oct 24.“The INDIA bloc leaders need to sit together and tell the people that ‘we are united’ and there is no conflict among us,” Congress MP from Katihar Tariq Anwar told TOI on Sunday, acknowledging the impact of the internal discord.“But we hope everything will be over by Monday, the last date for filing nominations for the second phase. There must not be any scope for a friendly fight,” he added.Despite the mounting tension, top INDIA bloc leaders have been largely absent from the campaign trail. RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, perceived as the opposition’s CM face, remains in Patna, chalking out strategy at home, while there is no clarity on the campaign plans of Congress leaders such as leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi, party president Mallikarjun Kharge and Wayanad MP Priyanka Gandhi.However, state RJD spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan sought to downplay the concerns. “Tejashwi will embark on a poll campaign after Diwali. Every party in the INDIA bloc wants him to campaign for their candidates. Although Tejashwi has filed his nominations from the Raghopur seat, he is, in fact, contesting elections on all 243 seats of Bihar,” Gagan said.Meanwhile, denial of tickets has triggered dramatic protests across the state. Candidates have been seen rolling on the ground, tearing their kurtas, crying bitterly before the camera and threatening to teach lessons to official nominees. The chaos comes just a fortnight before the first phase of polling on Nov 6.In Patna, RJD leader Madan Shah, seeking a ticket from the Madhuban seat, broke down outside the 10,Circular Road residence of former CM Rabri Devi, tearing his kurta in despair. “Lalu ji promised a ticket from the Madhuban seat, but it was given to someone else. I will die… Can’t bear the pain,” he shouted.Another aspirant, Usha Devi, cried bitterly before the reporters outside Rabri’s residence. “I have been associated with the RJD for the past 20 years and have been the torchbearer of the party in the region, but the ticket went to someone else… This is heart-breaking, but I will still campaign for the RJD,” she said, describing RJD chief Lalu Prasad as a “father figure.”In Gopalganj, former RJD legislator Reyazul Haq Raju broke down during a live online session, expressing anguish over not receiving a party ticket while three-time Congress legislator from Kasba in Purnia district, Afaque Alam, accused party leaders of demanding money in exchange for tickets.“The state unit of Congress has now become hostage in the hands of ‘personal brokers of some leaders’. Ground-level workers who have been struggling for the party for years are being ignored for tickets while outsiders have a field day,” Alam alleged on Sunday.", INDIA bloc partners fielding candidates against each other.

Bihar elections: 5 tips Congress can take from BJP’s pre-poll playbook - from cadre to alliance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-elections-5-tips-congress-can-take-from-bjps-pre-poll-playbook-from-cadre-to-alliance/articleshow/124687528.cms,"Shah Avoids Naming Bihar CM Face, Says Bihar CM to Be Decided by Elected MLAs

Ground cadre

Alliance discipline and timely seat-sharing

Unified leadership and disciplined message

Candidate selection

Forward-looking campaigning

NEW DELHI: When Chirag Paswan campaigns shoulder to shoulder with BJP leaders, Nitish Kumar fine-tunes his alliance messaging, and BJP’s top brass, from Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Union home minister Amit Shah, lead high-pitched rallies, the Congress and its Mahagathbandhan allies still appear tangled in seat-sharing disputes and mixed messaging.As Bihar heads for assembly polls, the contrast between the Congress’s pre-poll uncertainty and the BJP’s methodical campaign machinery could not be starker. While results will tell whether the BJP’s precision planning converts into votes, its playbook offers the Congress five clear takeaways if it wants to regain relevance in the election battleground.The BJP’s biggest strength remains its disciplined network of booth-level workers, nurtured through the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and local shakhas. In the run-up to Bihar elections , both Modi and Shah have frequently interacted with ground volunteers through digital town halls, giving micro-tasks such as voter outreach, welfare-scheme verification, and local mobilisation.In contrast, Congress cadres continue to complain about a top-heavy command structure and weak communication between state and central units, problems that the party’s own post-poll reviews since 2019 have acknowledged.As BJP unveiled its full list of 101 candidates, visuals of Congress workers protesting ticket distribution circulated widely last week, highlighting accusations of bias and lack of transparency within its Bihar unit.To counter BJP’s organisational muscle, Congress must rebuild from the booth up - empower local communicators, reward consistent volunteers, and create digital feedback loops that turn engagement into turnout.In Bihar, the BJP finalised its pre-poll arithmetic well before the nomination window — 101 seats each for BJP and JD(U), 29 for LJP (Ram Vilas), and 6 each for HAM (Secular) and RLM.By contrast, the Congress-RJD-CPI(ML) bloc remains locked in disagreements, with smaller allies voicing frustration over delay and imbalance. Several alliance partners even fielded overlapping candidates as nominations for Phase 1 closed.Early seat-sharing sends a message of clarity and control. Congress needs to close deals before deadlines - visible rifts undermine confidence among voters and cadres alike.The BJP has turned PM Modi into its central brand, letting state leaders campaign under a unified triad of vikas (development), samman (respect), and suraksha (security). In Bihar, it avoided naming a chief-ministerial face, insulating itself from Nitish Kumar’s anti-incumbency while keeping focus on ""Modi ki Guarantee.""The Congress, meanwhile, continues to project fragmented messaging. Its Bihar unit has seen frequent leadership churn, and Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra themes have yet to translate into a coherent local pitch.Elections reward consistency. Congress needs one emotionally resonant storyline, Bihar-specific but tied to national aspirations, that every leader can echo without dilution.The BJP’s ticket distribution appears increasingly data-driven: constituency-level surveys, winnability audits, and digital tracking shape final lists. It has also deployed senior organisational leaders from Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand to supervise tough regions.Congress, by contrast, continues to rely on familiar faces and late entrants. Its own internal reviews (AICC, 2022-23) flagged lack of local credibility as a recurring reason for losses.Winnability, not hierarchy, must guide choices. Congress may benefit from focussing on candidates with local connect and accountability, not just name recall.Congress’s current campaign focuses heavily on warnings of “vote chori” and allegations of voter-roll manipulation. While such themes energise the base, they rarely appeal to undecided or aspirational voters who prioritise jobs, growth, and education.The BJP, by contrast, anchors its message in delivery and promises — publicising welfare “guarantees,” housing schemes, and local infrastructure achievements through Modi’s personal brand.A constructive, Bihar-centric vision, job creation, youth opportunities, and agricultural reform, can help Congress shift from grievance to governance mode.As election dates near, Congress risks being squeezed between the NDA’s organisational machine and newer regional fronts seeking to tap disillusioned voters. The party’s revival in Bihar will depend on whether it can blend a forward-looking local agenda with disciplined alliance management and credible grassroots presence.Without that recalibration, it risks remaining a spectator in a contest increasingly defined by clarity of message - something the BJP has mastered ahead of yet another high-stakes Bihar poll.","The Congress and its Mahagathbandhan allies still appear tangled in seat-sharing disputes and mixed messaging. The BJP’s biggest strength remains its disciplined network of booth-level workers, nurtured through the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh.

CHANDIGARH: In another dramatic twist in IPS officer Y Puran Kumar’s suicide, Rohtak police on Wednesday registered an FIR of abetment to suicide and criminal conspiracy, naming all those mentioned in the final video of ASI Sandeep Kumar Lather, who allegedly shot himself on Tuesday after accusing Puran Kumar of corruption.The FIR (number 305) was registered at Sadar police station in Rohtak a few hours after Haryana CM Nayab Singh Saini visited Sandeep’s family in Ladhot village on Wednesday morning and promised justice.The FIR had not been made public at the time of filing this report, but according to highly placed sources, four persons are named in it — including the deceased IPS officer’s wife Amneet P Kumar, an IAS officer of 2001 batch, her brother Amit Rattan, who is an AAP MLA in Punjab, and head constable Sushil Kumar, who was Puran Kumar’s PSO and is now in jail remand in a corruption case.The FIR was registered under BNS sections 108 (abetment to suicide) and 61 (criminal conspiracy) on a complaint submitted by Sandeep’s wife Santosh. TOI contacted Amit Rattan but was yet to get any response till midnight.Sources say Virendra Badkhalsa, OSD to Haryana CM, informed Sandeep’s family about registration of FIR on Wednesday evening. TOI has spoken with two of the negotiators who were present when the contents of the FIR were read out to the family.Only then did Sandeep’s family agree to an autopsy. Around the same time, Puran Kumar’s body was being cremated in Chandigarh, 230km away, after eight days of stalemate.Sandeep’s body, which was so far kept in a hired freezer by the family, was taken to PGIMS Rohtak at night. Cremation will follow postmortem on Thursday morning, said sources in the family.Sandeep was part of the team that was investigating the case allegedly involving Puran Kumar, and was also involved in the arrest of Puran Kumar’s former PSO on Oct 5.It was this FIR, registered on Oct 6, that’s alleged to be the trigger for Puran Kumar’s suicide as Sushil was alleged to have given a statement that he was demanding money on behalf of Puran Kumar, who was then Rohtak IG.Haryana govt found itself battling on two fronts. Amneet and other members of the family had refused to allow autopsy until action was taken against DGP Shatrujeet Kapur and then Rohtak SP Narendra Bijarniya, who were among those named by Puran Kumar in his suicide note. Bijarniya was transferred on Oct 10 and Kapur was sent on leave on Monday midnight.Less than 12 hours after Kapur was sent on leave, Sandeep shot himself after releasing a final video in which he called Kapur honest and accused Puran Kumar of corruption. In the video, he said Puran Kumar’s suicide was due to “humiliation from corruption charges” and had “nothing to do with caste issues”.Sandeep’s family took away his body, kept it in a freezer in Ladhot, and refused to allow autopsy or cremation until an FIR was registered against all those he had named in the video and his four-page suicide note.The Haryana CM, accompanied by ministers Krishan Lal Panwar and Mahipal Singh Dhanda, rushed to the village on the outskirts of Rohtak on Wednesday morning to console the family. Sandeep’s sisters tearfully asked Saini what was their brother’s fault, and pleaded for justice, said a source.The CM assured the grieving family that appropriate action would be taken, and justice would be delivered.Apart from the FIR, the family wanted a job for a relative and financial assistance, to which govt agreed.","Haryana CM Nayab Singh Saini visited Sandeep Kumar Lather's family in Ladhot village on Wednesday morning and promised justice. His wife Amneet P Kumar, an IAS officer of 2001 batch, her brother Amit Rattan, who is an AAP MLA in Punjab, and head constable Sushil Kumar, who was Puran Kumar’s PSO, are named in the FIR.

This is an insult to the voters of Maharashtra and the country. All the group presidents (group presidents), branch presidents, and election list heads should go door to door and count the votes.
