As Bihar heads into a heated two-phase assembly election on November 6 and 11, the political scene saw a day of rapid developments on Thursday — from the Election Commission’s strong defence of its voter roll revision to the NDA completing its candidate lists, while the Mahagathbandhan (MGB) remains mired in seat-sharing talks. Tej Pratap Yadav filed his nomination amid family tensions, and Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath took direct aim at the opposition over the burqa voter verification controversy.The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) formally declared all its candidates for the 243-member Bihar Assembly, with both JD(U) and BJP announcing 101 seats each. Other allies, the Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), the Rashtriya Lok Morcha (RLM) and the Hindustani Awami Morcha (HAM), have also completed their lists.JD(U)’s second list featured ministers Sheila Mandal, Vijendra Prasad Yadav, Leshi Singh, Jayant Raj and Zama Khan, along with turncoats Chetan Anand and Vibha Devi. “The JD(U) has now released all 101 candidates,” the party said.The BJP, meanwhile, unveiled its list of 40 star campaigners, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah and party president JP Nadda. It also includes five chief ministers: Yogi Adityanath, Hemanta Biswa Sarma, Rekha Gupta, Mohan Yadav and Devendra Fadnavis — and a mix of senior leaders and Bhojpuri stars such as Pawan Singh, Manoj Tiwari and Ravi Kishan.The first phase of polling will be held on November 6, the second on November 11, and counting on November 14.The Congress Party unveiled its first list of 48 candidates for the Bihar election with no finalisation of a Mahagathbanthan seat-sharing deal yet.Among the prominent names, state Congress chief Rajesh Ram is set to contest from the Kutumba seat, while the Leader of the Congress Legislature Party (CLP), Shakeel Ahmad Khan, will represent the Kadwa constituency.The list includes a diverse group of candidates, ranging from Bagaha's Jayesh Mangal Singh to Patna Sahib's Shashant Shekhar.While the NDA went into campaign mode, the opposition Mahagathbandhan (MGB) is yet to finalise its seat-sharing formula. RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav filed his nomination from Raghopur but refrained from announcing the alliance’s seat division.Congress leader Kanhaiya Kumar said an agreement within the INDIA bloc would be announced “soon”. Speaking to reporters, he said, “Discussions are progressing in the right direction… the people believe in Tejashwi Yadav as their leader.”He accused the Nitish Kumar-led government of “failing to meet the people’s needs over the last 20 years” and cited a CAG report on Rs 73,000 crore in unutilised funds. “Bihar’s youth deserve better. Rats drinking liquor, stolen bridges and question paper leaks show the scale of corruption,” Kumar said.He confirmed he would not contest the election but would campaign across 243 constituencies, adding: “My beliefs have not changed. Only the platform has.”Janshakti Janata Dal (JJD) chief Tej Pratap Yadav filed his nomination from Mahua with a roadshow, carrying a photo of his grandmother. “I have moved ahead with the blessings of my grandmother and my parents. People of Mahua will support whoever works for them,” he said.Tej Pratap, earlier expelled from the RJD, now leads his own party after a public rift with his brother Tejashwi. He recently unfollowed Tejashwi on X, adding to speculation of a full family break.Mahua, currently held by RJD’s Mukesh Kumar Raushan, will now see a high-profile contest. Tej Pratap said he had worked to make Mahua a district and promised jobs for the youth.The Election Commission on Thursday defended the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of Bihar’s electoral roll before the Supreme Court, calling it “accurate” and dismissing allegations of Muslim voter exclusion as “false and communal”.“This communal approach is to be deprecated,” the poll body said in its affidavit, responding to a petition by the Association of Democratic Reforms and activist Yogendra Yadav. The EC told the court that “no appeal has been filed by any voter” since the publication of the final roll and that errors had been minimal.It added that 3.66 lakh names were deleted due to duplication, migration or deaths, and that “not a single objection has been reported so far”. The final voter count now stands at 7.42 crore — down by 47 lakh from the earlier list.The bench, led by Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi, posted the matter for further hearing on November 4.On the campaign trail in Danapur, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath accused the RJD-Congress combine of “mischief” over the EC’s decision to verify the identity of burqa-clad women voters.“Should fake voters be allowed to vote? The Congress and RJD want this to happen,” he said, claiming the opposition opposed electronic voting “because they want to restore the old system of booth capture”.He linked Bihar’s politics to cultural heritage, saying, “After the construction of a grand temple of Lord Ram at Ayodhya, the birthplace of Goddess Sita in Sitamarhi is all set for a facelift.”Calling the RJD’s allies “partners of the mafia”, Yogi declared, “Under NDA rule, they will meet the same fate in Bihar.”",Bihar heads into heated two-phase assembly election on November 6 and 11.

CHANDIGARH: In another dramatic twist in IPS officer Y Puran Kumar’s suicide, Rohtak police on Wednesday registered an FIR of abetment to suicide and criminal conspiracy, naming all those mentioned in the final video of ASI Sandeep Kumar Lather, who allegedly shot himself on Tuesday after accusing Puran Kumar of corruption.The FIR (number 305) was registered at Sadar police station in Rohtak a few hours after Haryana CM Nayab Singh Saini visited Sandeep’s family in Ladhot village on Wednesday morning and promised justice.The FIR had not been made public at the time of filing this report, but according to highly placed sources, four persons are named in it — including the deceased IPS officer’s wife Amneet P Kumar, an IAS officer of 2001 batch, her brother Amit Rattan, who is an AAP MLA in Punjab, and head constable Sushil Kumar, who was Puran Kumar’s PSO and is now in jail remand in a corruption case.The FIR was registered under BNS sections 108 (abetment to suicide) and 61 (criminal conspiracy) on a complaint submitted by Sandeep’s wife Santosh. TOI contacted Amit Rattan but was yet to get any response till midnight.Sources say Virendra Badkhalsa, OSD to Haryana CM, informed Sandeep’s family about registration of FIR on Wednesday evening. TOI has spoken with two of the negotiators who were present when the contents of the FIR were read out to the family.Only then did Sandeep’s family agree to an autopsy. Around the same time, Puran Kumar’s body was being cremated in Chandigarh, 230km away, after eight days of stalemate.Sandeep’s body, which was so far kept in a hired freezer by the family, was taken to PGIMS Rohtak at night. Cremation will follow postmortem on Thursday morning, said sources in the family.Sandeep was part of the team that was investigating the case allegedly involving Puran Kumar, and was also involved in the arrest of Puran Kumar’s former PSO on Oct 5.It was this FIR, registered on Oct 6, that’s alleged to be the trigger for Puran Kumar’s suicide as Sushil was alleged to have given a statement that he was demanding money on behalf of Puran Kumar, who was then Rohtak IG.Haryana govt found itself battling on two fronts. Amneet and other members of the family had refused to allow autopsy until action was taken against DGP Shatrujeet Kapur and then Rohtak SP Narendra Bijarniya, who were among those named by Puran Kumar in his suicide note. Bijarniya was transferred on Oct 10 and Kapur was sent on leave on Monday midnight.Less than 12 hours after Kapur was sent on leave, Sandeep shot himself after releasing a final video in which he called Kapur honest and accused Puran Kumar of corruption. In the video, he said Puran Kumar’s suicide was due to “humiliation from corruption charges” and had “nothing to do with caste issues”.Sandeep’s family took away his body, kept it in a freezer in Ladhot, and refused to allow autopsy or cremation until an FIR was registered against all those he had named in the video and his four-page suicide note.The Haryana CM, accompanied by ministers Krishan Lal Panwar and Mahipal Singh Dhanda, rushed to the village on the outskirts of Rohtak on Wednesday morning to console the family. Sandeep’s sisters tearfully asked Saini what was their brother’s fault, and pleaded for justice, said a source.The CM assured the grieving family that appropriate action would be taken, and justice would be delivered.Apart from the FIR, the family wanted a job for a relative and financial assistance, to which govt agreed.","Haryana CM Nayab Singh Saini visited Sandeep Kumar Lather's family in Ladhot village on Wednesday morning and promised justice. His wife Amneet P Kumar, an IAS officer of 2001 batch, her brother Amit Rattan, who is an AAP MLA in Punjab, and head constable Sushil Kumar, who was Puran Kumar’s PSO, are named in the FIR.

BENGALURU: A city-based surgeon was charged with murdering his wife, a Victoria Hospital dermatologist, by administering an overdose of an anaesthetic under the pretext of treating her.The autopsy report from the forensic science laboratory (FSL) completely changed the contours of the case, turning it from one of unnatural death to that of a cold-blooded murder, police said.The victim, Kritika M Reddy, 28, died in April this year, but police arrested the accused, Dr Mahendra Reddy G S, 31, only on Tuesday after the FSL report confirmed the presence of an anaesthetic in the viscera samples of Kritika.The couple was married in March 2024.Read also: ‘Never gave anaesthesia’: Big twist in Bengaluru dermatologist murder Accused Mahendra is a surgical resident at the Institute of Gastroenterology Sciences and Organ Transplant (IGOT).

Now, her father, K Muni Reddy, has filed a fresh complaint, accusing his son-in-law of administering an overdose of the anaesthetic to kill the victim,” the police official said.Investigation revealed that Mahendra had moved Kritika to Cauvery Hospital in Marathahalli on April 24, saying she had fallen unconscious at their Munnekolal residence in Whitefield.

He also made his father-in-law pitch a similar plea to police. Cops, though, went ahead with the autopsy.ACP (east) Ramesh Banoth said: “According to the husband, he was trying to treat his wife who was suffering from gastrointestinal issues for a long time.”According to police sources, Kritika’s ill-health disturbed her husband.Read also: 'Toxic chemicals found inside body' “Soon after their marriage, Mahendra discovered that Kritika had several health issues.
