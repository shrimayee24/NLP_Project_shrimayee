'Balakot Strike Helped Modi': Telangana CM'S Big Pulwama Attack On BJP Govt

NEW DELHI: Home minister Amit Shah has said that the Supreme Court granting interim bail to Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal is ""not a routine judgment"". The home minister also added that many people believe the Aam Aadmi Party chief was given special treatment.Amit Shah, in an interview to news agency ANI, said, "" ... I believe this is not a regular or a routine judgement.A lot of people in this country believe that special treatment has been given."" The Supreme Court granted Kejriwal interim bail on May 10 until June 1 for the Lok Sabha election campaign. The bench had clarified that the grant of interim bail will not be treated as an expression of opinion on the merits of the case or the criminal appeal which is pending consideration before it.On the question of Kejriwal adding new strength to the INDIA alliance campaign after walking out of jail, the Home Minister said, ""Right now he is stuck in another issue [Swati Maliwal assault], let him get free from that then let's see what happens.""Dismissing Kejriwal's claims that the central government installed cameras in Tihar jail to keep a watch on him, the Union Home Minister said that the Tihar jail administration is with the Delhi government. ""Tihar is with them (Delhi government), not with us. They are lying continuously. Jail administration is with the Delhi government, it's with Kejriwal. Not with the Home Ministry,"" Shah said.Talking about how the Opposition has been raising question on Balakot strike and Pulwama attack recently during the election campaign, Union Home Minister Amit Shah said, "" ... Narendra Modi. [Narendra Modi has attacked in their own home.] Adding further he claimed the Opposition is questioning the strikes to mislead the people of the country. ""Had they seen Pakistan's reaction after surgical strike and air strike, they would not have said this. They have become of such petty mindset, that they are misleading people as if nothing has happened,"" he said.Several Congress leaders, including Telangana chief minister Revanth Reddy , have recently raised fresh questions over the Pulwama terror attack and Balakot air strike. Hitting hard at the party, Amit Shah said, ""So many bomb blasts occurred in 10 years of Sonia-Manmohan government, was any concrete reply given for any of them? ... What did you do? You did not even oppose it for fear of losing your minority vote bank.""","Amit Shah said that the Supreme Court granting interim bail to Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal is ""not a routine judgment"" The home minister also added that many people believe the Aam Aadmi Party chief was given special treatment.

For Punjab, it suggested an increase of 13% and 15% for govt employment and education respectively.NCBC's 'advisory' comes amid an intensifying battle between BJP, on the one hand, and TMC, AAP and Congress, on the other, over quotas. The INDIA bloc has alleged that BJP is seeking 400 seats so that it can abolish quotas by amending the Constitution. BJP has retaliated by citing moves by Congress to cut into the quota for OBCs by declaring Muslims as a whole as ""backward"" in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.NCBC chairman Hansraj Ahir told TOI that he had been taking up this issue with the two states for quite some time but they were yet to comply. ""We have yet again written to them to provide the leftover quota to OBCs,"" he said.NCBC said that in West Bengal, quota for SCs, STs, and OBCs was 22%, 6% and 17% respectively, adding up to 45%. In case of Punjab, quota for SCs and OBCs was 25% and 12% respectively for govt employment.NCBC said Punjab govt officials had appeared before the commission in Feb and informed that a decision on enhancing OBC quota was in advanced stages and they would comply at the earliest. However, Ahir expressed displeasure and said ""action taken and concerns still remain unanswered"".",NCBC recommended that West Bengal increase the quota for OBCs by 5% in govt employment and educational institutions.

Should I think about my image and not speak about it at all? I will not allow my country to be divided like that. Aren’t all Hindustanis one?” he said.

Now you will say ‘Hindu budget,’ ‘Muslim budget.’ Can this country have a separate budget for Hindus and Muslims?”Modi said Congress had shown the “green flag” to distribution of money on the lines of religion and had even asked state govts to spend 15% of their budget only on members of a minority community. “Aap kalpana kar sakte hain ki Budget ka is prakar se tukde karna kitna khatarnak vichar hai. Aur aap jaante hai Congress ke liye minority sirf ek hi hai — unka apna priya vote bank (You can imagine how dangerous the thinking of dividing the budget this way is. For Congress, there is only one minority community — its dear vote bank),” Modi said.Describing Uddhav Thackeray’s Shiv Sena UBT again as ‘Nakli Sena’, he said it had joined Congress and was mum on all such things and also on Congress’s clean chit to Pakistan and terrorists. He challenged Sena UBT to get ‘Congress’s Shehzada’ (Rahul Gandhi) to say five positive sentences about Veer Savarkar. Modi said the ‘Nakli Sena’ would merge with Congress after LS poll results and “would cease to exist.”He also accused Rahul of insulting Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, indirectly referring to a clip where the Congress MP was handed a bust of Shivaji on a dais during a recent poll rally.The PM also said in Kalyan that he has prepared a blueprint for work to be done in the first 100 days after formation of his govt and appealed to youth to send him innovative suggestions about what work should be done so that he could make it a target of “the first 125 days instead of 100” and could work on their suggestions for 25 days separately.Modi reiterated Congress was planning to give Muslims the quota meant for SCs, STs and economically weaker sections. “Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar never intended to have reservation on religious lines,” he said.Modi asserted Congress would lose the LS polls in such a way that it would be difficult for it to even get the tag of main opposition party .",PM Narendra Modi claims Congress had drawn up a plan to spend 15% of the Union Budget exclusively on Muslims when it was in office. He said the govt led by Manmohan Singh then had to shelve the plan after strong opposition from him in his role as Gujarat chief minister and BJP. Modi said Congress had shown the “green flag” to distribution of money on the lines of religion.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110157249,imgsize-1443492,width-400,resizemode-4/110157249.jpg"
Lok Sabha polls: Finger in every pie? 'Double voters' press button where they are and 'back home',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lok-sabha-polls-finger-in-every-pie-double-voters-press-button-where-they-are-and-back-home/articleshow/110157198.cms,"‘Only

Aadhaar linking

can stop double voting’

Candidates with less than 30% vote share have won elections. That's changed now

Shanti keeps her hair well-oiled every election, preparing for a ""picnic"" - voting at home in Mumbai's Panvel as well as her native village in Maharashtra. She isn't alone. Countless others across the country are taking the one-person one-vote principle for a ride in a seamy sideshow of the great Indian festival of democracy.With large numbers of migrants, floating populations and many voter IDs not linked to Aadhaar yet, double voting is more common than many would like to believe, and most officials are in denial or profess ignorance.""We were advised to oil our hair. Just before my turn (to vote), I was asked to ensure my index finger is oily by rubbing it against my hair. As soon as the ink was applied, I rubbed my finger back again in my oily hair and most of the ink was gone,"" Shanti said, recalling how she and many others in Mumbai from their Raireshwar village pull off the double act. Raireshwar is a few hours' drive from Panvel and ""the journey together to vote is like a picnic"", she adds.Ahmedabad's Neeraj offers a peek into another ""ride"". The 28-year-old vegetable vendor was among many herded into a bus arranged by a major political party and taken to vote in their native Rajasthan on April 24, two days before polling day.Neeraj voted again May 7, in Ahmedabad-West. ""I have two voter IDs. I went to Rajasthan to vote with my family in Sirohi last month,"" Neeraj said, holding back his full name.Satish Patel didn’t bother with any hide and seek, posting pictures of himself with ink-stained forefingers on both hands to claim he had voted twice “legally” in Gujarat’s Navsari Lok Sabha seat. Patel, a former councillor of Congress, joined BJP in March this year.In Neeraj’s case, Gujarat chief electoral officer P Bharathi insisted voting twice was illegal but said she would need to verify Neeraj’s case. “We have not come across any complaints of people voting in Gujarat and also in their native places,” Bharathi said.On Patel’s claim, the Navsari collector dismissed it as fake and said he had cast the ballot the second time as an “assistant voter” for his disabled daughter.In Maharashtra’s Chandrapur, at least 50% of the residents of 14 villages straddling the Telangana border cast votes in neighbouring Adilabad on May 13. Flaunting dual voter ID cards, they did not miss voting in Chandrapur either, during the first phase on April 19. Villagers said the Adilabad administration had set up six booths in these 14 Maharashtra villages. As per Maharashtra govt records, there are 5,117 voters in these villages.Adilabad collector Rajarshi Shah told TOI he was “busy with elections and will look into the issue after he gets free”, without refuting the dual voting trend.His counterpart in Chandrapur, Vinay Gowda, who had earlier called it a criminal offence, refused to answer TOI’s calls and text messages.The northeast is not an outlier in this practice. The village of Ranibari, in the foothills of Meghalaya, is “part of both Guwahati and Shillong LS constituencies”. Living along the disputed Assam-Meghalaya border areas, these “dual voters” have been exercising their franchise in Assam for decades, even after creation of Meghalaya in 1972.Despite Meghalaya officials’ stance against double voting, residents with valid identification proof from both states continue to participate in elections in both states. Officials struggle to check it. This time, many of the hamlet’s nearly 200-odd people voted on May 7 in the Guwahati LS seat, after having done so for the Shillong LS seat on April 19.“With poll officers from both Assam and Meghalaya approaching us, we got voter IDs made. When the authorities from both sides want us to vote, can we sit idle at home on election day?” says Pranab Rangsha, (56), headman of Ranibari village.Manash Jyoti Bora, an election officer in Assam’s Kamrup, believes only the completion of Aadhaar-voter ID linking will check “dual voters” while pointing out that only over 50% of voters have completed such coupling. Meghalaya chief electoral officer BDR Tiwari said he was “unaware of villagers possessing two voter IDs cards” or voting twice.(With inputs from Hemali Chhapia in Mumbai, Vaibhav Ganjapure and Mazhar Ali in Nagpur, Paul John and Meghdoot Sharon in Ahmedabad, Kangkan Kalita in Guwahati)","Double voting is more common than many would like to believe, and most officials are in denial or profess ignorance.

While Congress’s manifesto resolves to implement personal law, Sharia law. Therefore, people of the country have to decide if this country will now function as per UCC or Sharia law. An impression of Muslim League is seen in Congress’s manifesto as it is playing politics of appeasement,” said Pushkar Dhami .Dhami said, “Congress will snatch right (of reservation) of SC, ST, OBC communities and give it to a community as they have done so in Karnataka already. Leaders of the arrogant (INDIA) alliance are openly announcing to give reservation to Muslim community. Therefore, you need a strong government led by Modi Ji, which will lead the country in the world.”Dhami also hit out at opposition parties for ‘stealing’ word ‘guarantee’ from BJP. In his address at Haryana’s Ambala, Dhami mostly talked about works done by BJP in Uttarakhand state and nationally, in his attempt to woo voters for Kataria. He said they are people who are seeking evidence of surgical strikes from armed forces.“They are misleading farmers and fulfilling their political interests. While the truth is that Modi Ji’s tenure has done most work for farmers since independence,” said Dhami.“BJP does what it promises at any cost and this is what is the guarantee of Narendra Modi Ji. Just by stealing, word ‘guarantee’ does become theirs (AAP’s or Congress’s). Today, many people are talking about several types of guarantees, but the actual guarantee of working style is Modi Ji’s guarantee,” said Dhami.Dhami also hailed Modi for 33% reservation to women by passing the Women Reservation Act, building Ram Temple, ending Triple Talaq.“They (opposition leaders) were given an invitation to attend the consecration of Ram Temple, but they did not come. They never wanted the dream of Ram Temple to come true, but this happened due to the leadership of Modi Ji. The arrogant alliance also disrespects Sanatan Dharam,” said Dhami.Dhami said ""late Ambala MP Rattan Lal Kataria had close relations with Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi and he was told about his demise by the PM himself during an event. He added Rattan Lal Kataria did a lot of work for Ambala being an MP from here and now, to take forward his work, the responsibility is on Banto Kataria.""“I am sure that Banto Kataria Ji is going to win by a huge margin from Ambala and she is going to break records of 2014 and 2019,” said Dhami.“Under the leadership of Narendra Modi Ji, India’s honour has increased at the world level and today, Indians irrespective of the country they are in, feel proud of their Indian identity. We have jumped to fifth economy from eleventh and soon, we are going to be the third largest economy. The resolution of developed India is to become number one economy in the world. Every company in the world today wants to invest in India,” said Dhami, while highlighting the developments done during the BJP government in the last 10 years.Dhami also highlighted welfare schemes started by BJP for poor people.“Uttarakhand state has taken the honour of becoming the first state in the country to implement Uniform Civil Code. Now, BJP’s manifesto has resolved to flow Gangotri of Uniform Civil Code that originated from Uttarakhand in the entire country. Entire country will benefit from it,” said Dhami.Slogans of Bharat Mata Ki Jai, Narendra Modi Zindabad and Abki Baar Modi Sarkar were raised during the BJP rally.Haryana minister Aseem Goel appreciated the efforts of the Uttarakhand government led by Dhami in implementing UCC and becoming the first state in the country to do so.Appealing to people to vote for Kataria, Goel said, “We have kept a target of giving a lead of 70,000 votes to Banto Kataria Ji from Ambala City assembly constituency.”","Uttarakhand chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami addressed BJP’s Vijay Sankalp rally in Ambala City, while campaigning for his party's Ambala Lok Sabha candidate Banto Kataria.

My every moment is for you, my every moment is for the country, that is why I say 24/7 for 2047.During this time, while questioning the efficiency of Rahul Gandhi , Modi without naming him said that the way India is developing rapidly in every field today, who can take the country from where we have reached today?

Whereas Modi is exposing their dirty secrets. I want to give an example to Congress and this example is recorded in history, I challenge Congress to answer this question of mine"".PM Modi while repeating his earlier statement that Congress openly said that ""Muslims have a right over the resources of the country and Manmohan Singh ji used to say it and during that time I was chief minister and I had opposed it.""PM Modi also claimed that Congress and its allies had planned to divide the country's development budget. They had thought of making a Hindu budget and a Muslim budget. Congress wanted 15% of the budget to be allocated for Muslims.""They (Muslim) had to create a religion in the name of the country and so they did. Congress was helpless and gave it. Now you will say Hindu budget, Muslim budget. Can this country have a separate budget for Hindus and Muslims?"" PM asked the crowd.""Congress was committing this sin and at that time I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat and I strongly opposed it. If Congress and its alliance come to power, they will do the same but is it right to divide the country on the basis of religion?,"" PM added.PM Modi said, ""Such party should not be allowed to win even a single seat in the entire country"".PM Modi accused Rahul that the ""prince"" of Congress is playing the same old game of appeasement by giving example of Muslim reservation given by Congress in Karnataka from OBC quota.PM said that before 2014 government there used to be bomb blasts all over the country and attacks on the border, but this did not happen after 2014.During this, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called out the previous governments and said that the previous government used to do peace talks when there was an attack, used to fly doves of peace, used to say please please do not attack us, these people shamed the brave land of India, but after 2014, Pakistan does not threaten India. Because we responded to their attack. We did air strikes strikes.PM Modi also said that now Pakistan has stopped giving atomic threats to us, but now this work is done by Congress people who asks us to respect Pakistan saying they have atomic power.During the rally PM Modi also accused Uddhav Thackeray that he does not see the mistakes of the prince of Congress who insulted Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj .The ""fake"" Shiv Sena has blindfolded itself, they do not even see the insult of Veer Savarkar by the prince of Congress.

During his visit, he addressed several events when he appealed to the public to vote for Congress.Haryana Congress chief Udai Bhan and former minister Nirmal Singh were also present with Hooda.In his address, Hooda said, “People of Haryana will vote for MSP guarantee, not for lathi and bullets to farmers, for 32 lakh government jobs, not for record breaking unemployment, for annual apprenticeship guarantee of Rs 1 lakh and not for sending youth to work as labourers in war zone Israel. People will vote for guarantee of vote and not for fear and crime.”“Congress is asking for votes in the name of development and welfare schemes, while BJP is asking for votes without showing any work or future plan. It is obvious that public votes will go to Congress and the sting of these votes will be felt by BJP,” said Hooda.Speaking about unemployment, Hooda said, “There is anger in the entire state including Northern Haryana that the BJP government forced our youth to leave the country by spreading massive unemployment. The youth are convinced that they have no future in the country under BJP rule. It is the reason why every second youth wants to go abroad through dunkie (illegal) routes or any other means. BJP policies have separated young children from their old parents. Congress wants to make Haryana a state from where no youth is forced to migrate from the country.”In his address, Chaudhary Udaibhan claimed that BJP wants to make India an undemocratic country like China and Russia by ""strangulating the Constitution"". “Now BJP does not care at all about bringing back black money, bullet train, smart city, rising prices of diesel-petrol, gas cylinder rates and double income of farmers, nor does BJP want any party to talk about the grassroots issues of the people. That is why those in power spread lies about the 5 justices and 25 guarantees of the Congress, but now the manifesto of Congress has reached the hands and hearts of the people,” he said.In his address, Congress Ambala candidate Varun Chaudhary said, “Lakhs of martyrs have sacrificed their lives to bring democracy in India. There can be no place for dictatorship in this country. Today every person is feeling pressure. The time has come to teach BJP a lesson, which crushed the voices of every section of the society including farmers, labourers, employees, panches-sarpanches, traders and businessmen either by lathis or bullets.”Varun promised that he will raise the voice of Ambala in Lok Sabha after being elected as MP, similar to the way he raised the voice for Mullana assembly constituency.","Hooda reached Ambala Cantonment to campaign for Congress Ambala Lok Sabha candidate Varun Chaudhary.

Amid allegations from the Congress and the JJP that his government was in the minority due to three Independent MLAs switching sides, CM Saini accused the opposition of misleading the public and challenged them to provide a written statement to the Governor, specifying the number of legislators supporting them.""We won the trust vote recently and will win it again if asked to prove majority in the House,"" he asserted, dismissing the Opposition's claims of the BJP leading a minority government.The political turmoil in Haryana intensified on Thursday when JJP chief and former deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala wrote to Governor Bandaru Dattatreya, urging him to intervene and call for a floor test . Chautala also suggested imposing President's Rule if the government failed to prove its majority. However, the presence of three JJP lawmakers at CM Saini's press conference hinted at divisions within the opposition party.In the meantime, BJP candidate Sanjay Tandon from Chandigarh and CM Nayab Saini conducted a joint roadshow in the capital city on Friday. Tandon will submit his nomination for the current Lok Sabha elections today. Previously, on Thursday, three Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) legislators visited the residence of state Panchayat Minister Mahipal Dhanda in Panipat to meet former chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar.As per reports, JJP's Devender Singh Babli, Jogi Ram Sihag, and Ramniwas Surjakhera arrived at Dhanda's residence in their individual vehicles. However, Dhanda later explained that the JJP MLAs came to see him to inquire about the health of his unwell nephew.The JJP leader reiterated his proposal to provide 'external support' to the Congress in toppling the current BJP government . On May 7, the Haryana government faced a significant setback when three independent MLAs retracted their support from the Nayab Saini government, placing the administration in the minority. The three MLAs were Randhir Golan from Pundri, Dharmpal Gonder from Nilokheri, and Sombir Singh Sangwan from Charkhi Dadri.All of them chose to offer their support to the Congress. Nevertheless, the BJP expressed confidence in maintaining power, as former chief minister Manhora Lal Khattar stated that numerous Congress and JJP leaders were in contact with his party. This development occurred during the Lok Sabha elections and just two months after Nayab Saini assumed office as CM, succeeding Khattar.In the 90-member House, the BJP holds 39 MLAs, the Congress has 30, the Jan Nayak Janata Party has 10, the Haryana Lokhit Party (HLP) has one, the Indian National Lok Dal has one, and there are seven Independents. Initially, the BJP had 41 MLAs, but the number decreased to 39 after the Karnal and Rania seats became vacant due to the resignation of two MLAs. Previously, six out of seven Independent MLAs supported the BJP.Following the withdrawal of support from three Independents, the BJP currently has the backing of three Independents and one HLP MLA, totaling 43 MLAs in the government. The state's 10 Lok Sabha seats will be contested in the penultimate phase on May 25.","Nayab Singh Saini, accompanied by three sitting Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) MLAs, addressed the media.
