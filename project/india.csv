NEW DELHI: BJP on Tuesday accused Rahul Gandhi of playing politics over the incident of the Odisha student committing self-immolation, after he termed the death a ""murder by BJP system"".Rahul said the ""brave student"" raised her voice against sexual harassment, but instead of being given justice, she was harassed and threatened by ""those who were supposed to protect her"". ""As always, BJP's system continued to shield the accused - & forced an innocent daughter to set herself on fire. This is not suicide, it is an organised murder by the system,"" he said.Reacting to this, Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan said the ""cheap politics"" played by Rahul Gandhi and Congress on the tragic incident involving Odisha's daughter is extremely unfortunate. ""Turning a serious and sensitive matter into a political weapon reflects his petty mindset. The incident in Odisha has shaken the entire nation, but Congress has seized this opportunity to bake its political bread,"" Pradhan said.Rahul also alleged PM Narendra Modi keeps silent on women's deaths - ""be it in Odisha or Manipur"". ""The country doesn't need your silence, it needs answers. India's daughters need safety and justice,"" he said.Pradhan said the PM and BJP have always taken concrete steps for women's safety and justice, while Congress has consistently sought opportunities in every tragedy. ""BJP government in Odisha stands with the victim's family, and the strictest action will be taken against the culprits,"" he added.","Rahul said the ""brave student"" raised her voice against sexual harassment, but instead of being given justice, she was harassed and threatened by ""those who were supposed to protect her"" ""This is not suicide, it is an organised murder by the system,"" he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122539793,imgsize-48240,width-400,resizemode-4/122539793.jpg"

JABALPUR: ""Ab humko beti ke upar rona kam aur kanoon ke upar rona jyada aata hai (Now we cry more over law than my daughter),"" said Suresh Kosta, father of Ashwini Kosta, 24-one of the two engineers from Madhya Pradesh who died in the Pune Porsche hit-and-run case.He was reacting to the recent judgement of the Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) that the accused will be treated as a minor.""In today's time, if parents do not keep an eye, children become adults mentally by the age of 14-15 years, though the law considers them adults after 18 years. In the recent case, if the same accident would have happened 4 months later, the accused would be considered an adult,"" Kosta told TOI.He added, ""In the present judgement, what I feel is that the JJB has not considered the killing of two youngsters as a heinous crime. Their death is not a heinous crime; hence the accused should be treated as a minor.""""We will cry our entire lives. But, currently I cry on law more than on my daughter. What can we do? We will approach the Maharashtra police and the lawyers to file an appeal,"" he said.The father of Anees Awadhiya (24), the second victim of the accident, OP Awadhiya, said, ""In this case, we are observing that JJB has shown leniency from the beginning, like bail was granted in just 15 hours and it took me 58 hours to bring the body of my kid to my home.This decision will not send a good message to society. The state govt there is working for justice and we were also hopeful that we will get justice. But it seems that there are pressures of any kind. The govt of Maharashtra is also serious about the case. I have come to know that the police there will move an appeal against the judgement of JJB. I feel that the judgement is not correct.""The accident occurred at 2.30am on May 19, 2024, on Kalyaninagar-Airport Road under the Yerwada police station limits. A minor, driving a Porsche car, rammed a motorcycle, killing Anees Awadhia and Ashwini Kosta, both 24-year-old.While Anees hailed from Pali town in Umaria.
