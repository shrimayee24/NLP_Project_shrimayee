High court summons Surat MP over pleas against his unopposed win,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/high-court-summons-surat-mp-over-pleas-against-his-unopposed-win/articleshow/112092034.cms,"AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court has issued summons to Bharatiya Janata Party MP from the Surat Lok Sabha constituency, Mukesh Dalal , over two petitions challenging his uncontested victory.The court of Justice JC Doshi issued summons to Dalal, directing him to respond by Aug 9, after the matter came up for hearing on July 25, the lawyer for petitioners PS Champaneri said on Sunday.Dalal was declared the winner on April 22, the last date for withdrawal of nomination, after Congress pick Nilesh Kumbhani 's nomination was rejected and other candidates withdrew from the race.The remaining 25 Lok Sabha seats in Gujarat went to polls on May 7 in the third phase of general elections. Including Surat, BJP won 25 seats in the state, with Congress bagging one.The petitioners have challenged the legality and validity of the decision of the Surat collector and returning officer to reject Kumbhani's nomination. The two petitions, filed by four voters from the Surat parliamentary constituency who are also Congress members, question the decision of the returning officer to reject Kumbhani's form under the provisions of Section 36 of the Representation of the People Act, concerning scrutiny of the nomination forms.The petitioners have claimed that Kumbhani's three proposers who later denied having signed his nomination papers had declared in an application before the deputy collector that they would be signing as proposers on his nomination form.They had done so while applying for the certificate declaring them voters of the same constituency, a pre-condition for proposers.Furthermore, the verification of signatures is not a collector's job, they contended, stressing that the Congress, being a national party, doesn't have any shortage of proposers for its candidates in a given constituency. Dalal became the first candidate in the last 12 years to win a Lok Sabha contest unopposed.","Mukesh Dalal was declared the winner on April 22, the last date for withdrawal of nomination.

Amit Shah: Sharad Pawar should apologize to Amit Shah for statement: Piyush Goyal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/sharad-pawar-should-apologize-to-amit-shah-for-statement-piyush-goyal/articleshow/112071868.cms,"Sharad Pawar faced backlash from BJP leaders after making accusations against Amit Shah, with demands for an apology.

MUMBAI/AKOLA/SAMBHAJINAGAR: Sharad Pawar must apologise to Union home minister Amit Shah for his statement that Shah had been externed by SC for misusing the law, Union minister and BJP MP from Mumbai North Piyush Goyal said on Saturday. While BJP state president Chandrashekhar Bawankule said the courts had given Shah a clean chit, BJP minister Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil said Pawar should refrain from making personal attacks.Pawar had made the “externment” taunt after Shah called the NCP (SP) chief the “kingpin of corruption.”Addressing a press conference at the BJP state headquarters, Goyal said it was the UPA govt, of which Pawar was an important part, which had filed a false and baseless case against Shah, which was ripped apart by Supreme Court.Goyal said, ""Sensing the increasing popularity of then Gujarat CM Narendra Modi and aware it was losing the next elections, the UPA govt tried to make out a false case against Shah so it could also ensnare Modi. Pawar was a cabinet minister and was part of this conspiracy.”Bawankule said, “The court has already given Shah a clean chit and therefore, Sharad Pawar’s statement is uncalled for. The allegations against Shah were made during the Congress era.”He alleged the Congress and Pawar’s political ideology revolves around power and money. “Amit Bhai does not speak unless he has concrete information. Criticising him is like showing a lamp to the sun,” Bawankule said.Responding to this, Pawar said, “The lamp (diya) they are alluding to, we have witnessed him in Maharashtra’s prisons.”Vikhe Patil said Pawar’s criticism was out of frustration. He further stated, “There are also allegations against Sharad Pawar on issues related to bomb blast accused which people know about. But that doesn’t mean we should keep on discussing the issues politically.”Vikhe Patil added that the SC had given a clean chit to Amit Shah on the issue. “Amit Bhai is our leader… He was Union home minister in the past and is the minister in the current govt of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In his tenure, he has done away with Article 370. Wonder why it could not happen earlier.” Pawar had said on Friday, “We have a home minister who was banished by the Supreme Court. It is astonishing that the individual responsible for the country’s security and who is helming the home ministry was once expelled from Gujarat by the Supreme Court.”",Sharad Pawar faced backlash from BJP leaders after making accusations against Amit Shah.

Whether it is Prez Nicolas Maduro who is chosen, or his main opponent, retired diplomat Edmundo Gonzalez , the poll will have ripple effects across the Americas.Govt opponents and supporters alike have signalled their interest in joining the exodus of 7.7million Venezuelans who have already left their homes for opportunities abroad should Maduro win another term.Polls opened at 6am across the country. The number of eligible voters is estimated to be around 17 million. Polls close at 6pm local time (3.30am IST), but it's not clear when the first results will be released.Authorities set Sunday's election to coincide with what would have been the 70th birthday of former Prez Hugo Chavez, the leftist firebrand who died of cancer in 2013, leaving his Bolivarian revolution in the hands of Maduro. But Maduro and his United Socialist Party of Venezuela are more unpopular than ever among many voters who blame his policies for crushing wages, spurring hunger, crippling the oil industry and separating families due to migration.Maduro is facing off against Gonzalez who is representing a coalition of opposition parties after being selected in April as a last-minute stand-in for opposition powerhouse Maria Corina Machado, who was blocked by the Maduro-controlled Supreme Tribunal of Justice from running for any office for 15 years.
