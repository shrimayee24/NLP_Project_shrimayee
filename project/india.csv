"Biren quits as CM of Manipur, assembly session suspended",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/biren-quits-as-cm-of-manipur-assembly-session-suspended/articleshow/118099815.cms,"Governor change hinted at Biren power shift

GUWAHATI: Manipur CM N Biren Singh's defiance of repeated resignation calls over his handling of the ethnic conflict raging there since May 2023 ended Sunday when he put in his papers on eve of the assembly's budget session, and a possible no-trust motion by Congress against the BJP-led government.Governor A K Bhalla accepted Biren's resignation and asked him to continue ""till alternative arrangements"". Late Sunday, the governor's secretariat notified that its Jan order summoning the assembly session stands ""null and void"" with immediate effect.The buzz around his resignation grew after Biren flew to Delhi, his second trip in a week, late Saturday. After a lengthy meeting with home minister Amit Shah on Sunday - BJP chief J P Nadda was also present - he returned to Imphal along with BJP's Northeast coordinator Sambit Patra.The closest that Biren had come to stepping down before this was on June 30, 2023, when a crowd of supporters, most of them Meitei women, waylaid his convoy en route to Raj Bhavan. An elderly woman then dramatically snatched his resignation letter and tore it to shreds.Over the next 19-odd months, the footballer-turned-politician would brave mounting pressure from within and outside BJP to quit as Manipur vacillated between violence and short-lived calm.As fissures within BJP deepened over the continuing conflict, Biren found himself in an increasingly vulnerable position.Last Nov, majority of BJP legislators, including those from the Meitei community, abstained from an emergency meeting convened by him to assess the situation in the wake of more violence attributed to tribal militants. Meghalaya CM Conrad Sangma’s NPP, a BJP ally, withdrew support to govt specifically over Biren’s handling of the conflict. Sangma said his party would reassess its stand if there was a change at the helm.In Manipur’s 60-strong assembly, NDA bloc consists of 37 BJP legislators, six from NPP, five of NPF, one from JD(U) and three Independents. Congress has five MLAs and Kuki People’s Alliance two. One seat fell vacant with the NPP incumbent’s death.The first signs of Biren’s position getting weaker came after Bhalla, a former Union home secretary, was appointed governor last Dec. Speculation about a change intensified last week with talk of a no-trust move.In his resignation to the governor, Singh said, “It has been an honour to serve the people of Manipur thus far. I am extremely grateful to central govt for time actions, interventions, developmental work and implementation of various projects for safeguarding the interests of every single Manipuri.”","Governor A K Bhalla accepted Biren's resignation and asked him to continue ""till alternative arrangements"" Late Sunday, the governor's secretariat notified that its Jan order summoning the assembly session stands ""null and void"" with immediate effect.

'After everything was ruined': Congress says Manipur CM Biren Singh’s resignation came 'too late',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-everything-was-ruined-congress-says-manipur-cm-biren-singhs-resignation-came-too-late/articleshow/118091953.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Congress on Sunday criticised the timing of Manipur chief minister N Biren Singh ’s resignation, arguing that his removal should have come earlier to prevent the deepening crisis in the state.Reacting to Singh’s resignation, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said, ""For nearly two years, BJP's CM Biren Singh instigated division in Manipur. PM Modi allowed him to continue despite the violence, loss of life, and the destruction of the idea of India in Manipur. The resignation of CM Biren Singh shows that mounting public pressure, the SC investigation and the no-confidence motion by the Congress have forced a reckoning. But the most urgent priority is to restore peace in the state, and work to heal the wounds of the people of Manipur. PM Modi must visit Manipur at once, listen to the people and finally explain his plan to bring back normalcy.""Congress leader Udit Raj echoed similar sentiments, stating, ""When the Congress party was demanding him to be removed at the right time then he was not removed... A rift has been created between the two communities forever. This govt should not be there for such a long time. Removing the CM after everything was ruined does not make any sense.""Singh submitted his resignation to Governor Ajay Kumar Bhalla at Raj Bhavan in Imphal on Sunday. He was accompanied by 14 MLAs from the BJP and NPF, along with state BJP president A Sharda and senior party leader Sambit Patra.In his resignation letter, Singh wrote, ""It has been an honour to serve the people of Manipur thus far. I am extremely grateful to the central government for timely actions, interventions, developmental work and implementation of various projects for safeguarding the interests of every single Manipuri.""His resignation came just hours after returning from Delhi, where he met Union home minister Amit Shah.On Saturday, Singh had convened a meeting with BJP-led ruling alliance MLAs at the CM Secretariat ahead of the upcoming assembly session beginning February 10. The meeting took place amid the opposition Congress’s plan to bring a no-confidence motion against his government.Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh accused Singh of stepping down only when his position became untenable. In a post on X, he said, ""The Congress was all set to move a no-confidence motion against the chief minister and his council of ministers in the Manipur Assembly tomorrow. Sensing the climate, the Manipur CM has just resigned. This was a demand that the Congress has been making since early May 2023, when Manipur erupted. The CM's resignation was belated. The people of Manipur now await a visit by our Frequent Flier PM who is off to France and the USA now – and who has found neither the time nor the inclination to go to Manipur these past twenty months.""Meanwhile, Congress MP Imran Masood said, ""He is resigning today after the death of so many people, after creating a divide between two communities. Now The Central Govt needs to interfere and work to stabilise the situation there.

NEW DELHI: A day after its crushing defeat in the Delhi assembly elections, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has alleged widespread violations of the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) and claimed that the entire system was against them.

""We are deeply saddened by the result. It feels like the system, Election Commission, police, and all powers were used by them (BJP) to intentionally cause the loss (to AAP).

The party had claimed that BJP workers were distributing cash and gifts to voters and using state institutions to harass AAP candidates. These claims were dismissed by the Election Commission at the time, which maintained that the elections were conducted fairly.Interestingly, Sisodia and Khan's comments come a day after Kejriwal had conceded defeat and congratulated the BJP.

NEW DELHI: As AAP reels from its crushing defeat in the Delhi elections, social activist Anna Hazare has delivered a scathing rebuke of Arvind Kejriwal, blaming his downfall on greed for power and money. Hazare, who once mentored Kejriwal during the anti-corruption movement, said their ties ended when the AAP leader ""took the wrong path."" Criticising the liquor policy, Anna said that the AAP leader's focus on power and liquor policies ultimately led to the party's demise after more than a decade in power.""Initially, I was not unhappy with him, but when he took the wrong path, came into power, and his thinking changed—focusing on liquor shops and all—our ties ended,"" Hazare said. ""Alcohol causes immense suffering to women. I am 90 but still healthy; if I had consumed alcohol, I would not be healthy,"" he added.The activist recalled Kejriwal’s earlier promises of simplicity and service to the people, which he believes were abandoned once AAP came to power. ""He used to say that he will stay in a small room all his life... Happiness is not found outside... Doing good work for society makes one happy from within. He did not understand this... Otherwise, he would have never thought of making the 'Sheesh Mahal',"" Hazare said.Speaking from his village Ralegan Siddhi, Hazare criticised Kejriwal's choices, saying that Kejriwal's governance strayed from the principles they had once fought for. ""When he formed the party, people trusted and supported him. Later, however, he started promoting liquor and went after money, which has drowned him and his party today,"" Hazare remarked.Hazare’s remarks come in the wake of AAP’s crushing defeat in the Delhi assembly elections, where the BJP secured over two-thirds of the seats, ending more than a decade of AAP’s rule in the capital. Kejriwal himself lost his long-held New Delhi seat to BJP’s Parvesh Verma by 4,089 votes. Other AAP bigwigs, including former deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and senior party figures like Satyendra Jain and Saurabh Bharadwaj, also faced defeats.The BJP’s return to power in Delhi after 27 years was met with strong remarks from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who called it a “historic” victory.

Among the frontrunners is rural development and panchayati raj minister Yumnam Khemchand Singh. A former speaker, RSS-backed Khemchand has been vocal against Biren's handling of the ethnic crisis that erupted in May 2023 and was among 19 BJP legislators who skipped a key meeting convened by the former CM last year. His recent summons to New Delhi has further fuelled speculation about his potential elevation.Another strong contender is T Biswajit Singh, a senior cabinet minister whose name has been in the mix for the top post since 2022.He was earlier considered as an alternative to Biren when BJP won its second consecutive term in Manipur 2022. T Satyabrata Singh, the current assembly speaker and another politician called to New Delhi for consultations, is also seen as a possible pick. While no official announcement has been made, BJP's Manipur unit president Adhikarimayum Sharda Devi said: ""Things will be known when it happens. There is a process.""

Looming Manipur trust vote may've forced Biren's hand,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/looming-manipur-trust-vote-mayve-forced-birens-hand/articleshow/118097525.cms,"GUWAHATI: N Biren Singh's resignation as Manipur's chief minister on Sunday after almost two years of parrying calls for his ouster came with the obvious question: Why now?The buzz is that the BJP brass in Delhi forced his hand, concerned over the widening rift among party legislators in the state over his handling of the ethnic conflict and the possibility of the opposition Congress going ahead with a damaging no-confidence motion against the BJP government despite not having the numbers to do so. Governor AK Bhalla declared his notification summoning the budget session from Monday ""null and void"" after Biren's resignation.BJP and its allies account for 45 MLAs in the House of 60, which, on paper, means the no-trust motion would have met a quick end. However, of the 37 BJP MLAs, seven are Kukis who might have abstained from voting. Also, among the remaining 30, Biren no longer enjoys unconditional support.The BJP brass would not have wanted to risk the slightest chance of embarrassment in the event of voting on the first opposition motion since this government assumed office. The fissures within BJP Legislature Party widened last Nov when 19 MLAs, including the seven Kuki legislators, skipped a meeting called by Biren to discuss law and order in the state in the wake of violence in Jiribam. The same month, BJP's strongest ally in the state - Meghalaya chief minister Conrad Sangma's NPP - withdrew support to the govt for Biren ""completely failing to resolve the crisis and restore normalcy"". Sangma said his party would review the decision if there was a leadership change.A leaked audio clip in which Biren purportedly makes offensive remarks against a community also went against him. The video went viral in August last year.On February 3, the Supreme Court sought a report from Central Forensic Science Laboratory on the tape that suggests Biren's role in fomenting ethnic violence.The Manipur government came out with statements twice - on August 8 and 20 last year - stating the clip was ""doctored"" and that its circulation on social media was ""a malicious attempt by certain sections to incite communal violence or derail the process of peace that has been initiated at multiple levels"".","N Biren Singh's resignation as Manipur's chief minister came with the obvious question: Why now?
