Opposition slams Chhattisgarh govt as 'rat' theory blamed for vanishing paddy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/opposition-slams-chhattisgarh-govt-as-rat-theory-blamed-for-vanishing-paddy/articleshow/126555551.cms,"Opposition alleged the ‘rat’ explanation was a cover for the scam as paddy worth Rs 30 crore has either rotted, gone missing or been written off



RAIPUR: 'Rats' have become Chhattisgarh's newest political flashpoint after managers at paddy procurement centres blamed rodents, among other reasons, for paddy worth crores of rupees going missing or rotting.In Kabirdham district, about 26,000 quintals of paddy worth Rs 7 crore were reported 'damaged', dried or missing from two procurement centres. Officials initially cited rats, termites, and weather as reasons for the loss, triggering a backlash from opposition parties which alleged a statewide scam in grain procurement and storage.The state issued a clarification, stating that reduction in paddy weight due to moisture loss and minor pest-related damage is a scientific, natural and decades-old phenomenon, not evidence of corruption. Officials stressed that paddy loses weight when stored in open due to evaporation of moisture, a physical process recognised across all major paddy-producing states.However, opposition parties alleged the 'rat' explanation was a cover for the scam as paddy worth Rs 30 crore across Kabirdham, Mahasamund, Jashpur, and Bastar has either rotted, gone missing or been written off on account of pests, moisture, and weather.Janta Congress Chhattisgarh launched a 'wanted rats' campaign in Kabirdham's Kawardha, putting up posters across district. The party's state chief, Amit Jogi alleged, ""They are saying rats ate paddy. So, we have put up posters and are searching for this missing rat."" He urged people to tell the party ""whether these rats have four legs or two.""As the controversy grew, BJP MP Brijmohan Agrawal added fuel to the fire with a sarcastic remark that the govt would ""arrange cats for the treatment of rats"" accused of devouring paddy. Congress pounced on the comment, calling it proof that the govt was trivialising large-scale losses. Former CM Bhupesh Baghel posted on X, ""Guarantee of rats, good governance of rats.""","In Kabirdham district, about 26,000 quintals of paddy worth Rs 7 crore were reported 'damaged', dried or missing.

NEW DELHI: Axis My India’s exit poll has projected a sweeping victory for the BJP-led NDA in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections.According to the survey, the BJP+ alliance, comprising the BJP and the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena, is predicted to win between 131 and 151 of the BMC’s 227 seats.The UBT+ bloc, which includes the Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena, MNS and NCP (SP), is projected to secure 58–68 seats, while the Congress-led alliance is expected to manage just 12–16 seats. Others are likely to win between six and 12 seats.Polling across Mumbai and 28 other municipal corporations in Maharashtra saw an estimated turnout of 46–50 per cent, officials said, lower than the 55.53 per cent recorded in Mumbai during the 2017 civic polls. Voting concluded at 5.30 pm amid heavy security, with more than 25,000 police personnel deployed in the city.The BMC election, held after a nine-year gap following delays caused by the pandemic, court rulings on OBC reservations and ward delimitation, witnessed a fiercely contested battle between the ruling Mahayuti and the reunited Thackeray cousins. Over 1,700 candidates were in the fray in Mumbai alone, with the civic body controlling an annual budget exceeding Rs 74,400 crore.The day was marred by controversy over claims that the indelible ink used on voters’ fingers could be easily removed. While the State Election Commission rejected the allegations, opposition leaders Uddhav and Raj Thackeray accused the poll body of serious irregularities, demanding accountability.","Polling across Mumbai and 28 other municipal corporations in Maharashtra saw an estimated turnout of 46–50 per cent.

Unnao rape survivor wants to tell HC more in Sengar appeal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/unnao-rape-survivor-wants-to-tell-hc-more-in-sengar-appeal/articleshow/126555200.cms,"BJP ex-MLA Kuldeep Sengar (File photo)



Unnao Rape Survivor Welcomes Supreme Court Order, Says Legal Fight To Continue Till Sengar Is Hanged

NEW DELHI: The Unnao rape survivor on Thursday moved Delhi HC seeking to bring on record more information in expelled BJP ex-MLA Kuldeep Sengar's appeal against his conviction in the case.In her petition, the survivor said she wanted to place before the court facts and documents to show ""relevant recent developments"", as well as threats to herself and her family over the 2017 case in the UP town.A bench of Justices Prathiba M Singh and Madhu Jain observed that the appeal was already at the stage of final hearing and listed the survivor's application for consideration on Feb 25. It asked the survivor's counsel to file relevant documents by Jan 31 and told Sengar and the CBI to file their replies to the plea.The survivor's plea also seeks a directive to record evidence of two officials from her school in Unnao to certify her date of birth. She alleged that Sengar influenced the probe and used forged documents about her age in the trial. These, she said, were now being relied upon in his appeal and this can be negated by tabling the additional evidence.Last month, HC had suspended Sengar's life imprisonment, saying he had already undergone seven years and five months of incarceration. The suspension order was later stayed by SC on Dec 29.","Unnao rape survivor moves Delhi HC seeking to bring on record more information in expelled BJP ex-MLA Kuldeep Sengar's appeal against his conviction in the case.
