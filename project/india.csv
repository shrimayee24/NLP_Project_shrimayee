NEW DELHI: Former Bihar minister and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tej Pratap Yadav is facing massive backlash from all quarters for his "" dance or be suspended "" remark to a policeman during Holi celebrations. On Saturday, he accused BJP, RSS , and media of politicising the festival and spreading hatred.""Don't mind, it's Holi... Even this festival of mutual brotherhood has been given a new colour of hatred by the BJP, RSS, and their lapdog media...,"" Yadav posted on X in Hindi, alongside a cartoon mocking media organisations.""Doing politics over celebrating Holi with police personnel or any opposition leader has become their religion. The people of the country will soon teach them a lesson,"" he added.The uproar erupted after a video from a Holi celebration at Yadav’s official residence in Patna on Friday, March 14, went viral. In the clip, the former Bihar minister was heard telling a police officer,(If you don’t dance, you will be suspended).The remark triggered sharp reactions, particularly from BJP leaders, who accused Yadav of disrespecting the police force.BJP MP Dinesh Sharma criticised Yadav, saying: ""He (Tej Pratap) will never get the right to suspend anyone. And he belongs to a family that insults the police and the uniform...(their family is only fit for drama), they would be considered unfit to run the government.""BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla also attacked Yadav, alleging that he was trying to bring back the era of ""Jungle Raj"" in Bihar.""Like father, like son. Father was the chief minister, the family was in power, and Bihar was kept in jungle raj. He made the law dance to his tunes. Now, he is out of power, but his DNA is the same: he wants to bring back Jungle Raj. Instead of respecting the law and the person wearing the uniform, the way Tej Pratap Yadav has insulted the person wearing the uniform shows that Jungle Raj is in his mindset and DNA, but he should understand that Bihar has changed now. Now there is good governance here.""Several retired senior police officers have also condemned Yadav's comments, calling them an ""insult"" and demanding action against him.Ajay Kumar Singh, a retired Delhi Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP), urged authorities to act against the RJD leader while stressing that no action should be taken against the officer involved, as he was merely following orders.""The uniform has dignity, and we have a code of conduct. It is clearly mentioned in the police manual that police personnel must not act against the code of conduct. Tej Pratap is behaving like an imposter; saying such things to your own security is an insult to the police.""Singh further added: ""We are hurt by this act...The policeman is not at fault—he simply followed orders. Taking action against him would be unfair and unacceptable.""","Tej Pratap Yadav accused BJP, RSS, and media of politicising the festival and spreading hatred.

He said, ""'Jungleraaj' has ended but Yuvraj of Lalu Yadav is threatening a policeman about the consequences if he (the policeman) will not comply with what he is instructing (to dance).

He has no power and authority to suspend anyone. This is Nitish Kumar's '', not Jungle Raj. Using such a language is unfortunate. RJD leaders have not evolved.""Not just the opposition but ally Congress also condemned Tej Pratap's actions. Congress leader Rashid Alvi said, ""I condemn what he said.

Lalu's 'kurta faad' Holi



Election bugle for Bihar



NEW DELHI:. A redemption of Lalu Yadav-style Holi celebration snowballed into a controversy after RJD leader and former chief minister's elder son Tej Pratap Yadav ordered a police constable to shake legs to avert his suspension.While Bharatiya Janata Party latched on to the former minister's ""prank"" to remind everyone of the ""Jungle Raj"" era, the act could be seen as RJD's desperate attempt to woo back its rural and backward caste vote banks ahead of the assembly elections scheduled at the end of the year.Similar to this year's Holi celebrations, RJD supremo used to organise grand Holi gatherings where Bihar's who's who used to line up to let their kurtas be torn into pieces.Slogan-shouting crowds and the procession of MLAs and MPs trooping in with drums and trumpets used to greet the uncrowned raja of Bihar.Lalu Yadav’s Holi celebrations were a spectacle of Bihar's rural life, which connected directly with the core of his voter base—mainly the Dalits, OBCs, and marginalized communities. His celebrations often included vibrant processions with drum beats, slogans, and an atmosphere of joyous abandon.This was symbolic of rural pride, and Lalu presented himself as a champion of the common man, particularly from the backward and poorer sections of society.Additionally, the state will also be diving into full-fledged election mode after Holi. Earlier during the celebration, Tej Pratap also proclaimed that Bihar has decided that Tejashwi would become chief minister after the upcoming elections.""It has been decided that Tejashwi will be the chief minister this time, on the occasion of this Holi,"" Tej Pratap had said.The political temperature of the state is already on the rise after Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar lost his cool several times in the assembly of the opposition leaders.Leader of opposition Tejashwi Yadav strongly objected to the language used by Nitish Kumar for his parents and once again raised questions over Bihar chief minister's health.Meanwhile, Bharatiya Janata Party attacked Lalu's family after Tej Pratap's video surfaced. BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla commented, ""Like father, like son. First, the father (Lalu Yadav) - as the then CM used to make law dance to his tunes and turn Bihar into a jungle raj. Now, the son, despite being out of power, attempts to make laws and protectors of law dance to his tunes through threats and pressure.""""He threatens Police personnel with suspension if he doesn't dance.

The ex-Lok Sabha MP took on and defeated AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal from the latter's New Delhi constituency.However, the saffron party eventually picked Gupta to lead the new government. This made her the fourth woman chief minister of Delhi after BJP's Sushma Swaraj, Sheila Dikshit of the Congress, and AAP's Atishi.Born on March 15, 1943, in the Mundka village, Sahib Singh Verma administered Delhi as its fourth CM from February 27, 1996, to October 12, 1998.He passed away on June 30, 2007, aged 64.","Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta likened her relationship with Parvesh Verma to the bond between a sister and a brother.
