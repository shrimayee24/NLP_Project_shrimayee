Political Row Erupts After Rahul Gandhi’s Convoy ‘Crushes’ Cop During Vote Adhikar Yatra

NEW DELHI: In a light-hearted remark, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Sunday joked that “talks are on” with RJD chief Lalu Prasad regarding his earlier suggestion that the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha should get married.The 55-year-old made the comment at a press conference in Araria district during the ongoing ‘Voter Adhikar Yatra’. Gandhi noted that he had received a similar suggestion from Lalu Prasad two years ago.The comment dates back to a press conference in Patna two years ago, where Lalu Prasad humorously urged Gandhi to get married, saying it was a wish of his mother, Sonia Gandhi , and that they wanted to see him as a ‘dulha’ (groom) and join the ‘baraat'.Gandhi’s remark came after RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav had suggested to Union minister Chirag Paswan that he should consider getting married.During the press conference, a journalist asked Yadav about Paswan’s attempts to portray the Congress as a “pichhlaggu” (sidekick) of the RJD.Yadav, the INDIA bloc’s chief ministerial candidate, responded humorously, saying he could mock Paswan’s claims of being a “Hanuman” for Prime Minister Narendra Modi , but he preferred not to take issue with him, whom he regards as an elder brother.“I would only advise him to get married. It is high time,” Yadav said, drawing laughter from the audience.Rahul Gandhi, who is often referred to by Yadav as ‘bade bhai’ during the Yatra, then remarked, “The advice is applicable to me as well. Talks are on with his father,” indirectly referring to Lalu Prasad.",Rahul Gandhi joked that “talks are on” with RJD chief Lalu Prasad regarding his earlier suggestion that the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha should get married.
