This came amidst row over the Trinamool Congress MLA's remarks who said that the Babri Masjid was yet to be rebuilt 30 years after its demolition.""Ram Mandir should not be built as a response to the mosque. Babri Masjid can be constructed, and Ram Mandir can also be constructed... The same person who said Babri Masjid will be constructed once said that Hindus would be massacred and thrown into the Bhagirathi. There was no show-cause notice or punishment for these statements,"" BJP leader Agnimitra Paul said.She accused Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee of stoking communal tensions in the state and said: ""Mamata Banerjee is behind these remarks... She is preparing another Bangladesh for her vote bank. Ram Mandir will be constructed. We will commemorate the one year of the Ayodhya Ram Mandir, and the foundation stone will be laid in Berhampur.""Earlier, TMC MLA Humayun Kabir had made comments regarding the Babri Masjid, calling it a deeply emotional issue for Muslims.""The Babri Masjid was a sentimental issue for Muslims. It was built by Babur, and we all know that in 1992, the Babri Masjid was demolished. It's been 30 years, and the Babri Masjid hasn't been rebuilt yet. In 2019, the Supreme Court passed a unanimous verdict, allocating five acres of land for constructing a mosque. With time, it will be built,"" he had said.""In Bengal, particularly in Murshidabad, some are saying that a new Babri Masjid will be built to provoke people. But there's no issue with that. There's no problem. Regarding the Babri Masjid land, if asked where the land will be bought, let me clarify that we haven't approached the state government for any land for the Babri Masjid. No, we have no intention of taking any government land or grants,"" he added.Rejecting allegations of involvement with Bangladeshis, Kabir said that border security was the central government's responsibility, asserting that he had not noticed any such issues in the area.",BJP leader Agnimitra Paul accused Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee of stoking communal tensions.

Rahul Gandhi Targets Govt & PM Modi In First Speech As Leader Of Parliament I N18V | CNBC TV18

The Nehru-Gandhi legacy and the Emergency



NEW DELHI: Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Friday took the centre stage in Lok Sabha with her maiden speech in Parliament. Participating in the two-day Constitution debate, Priyanka led the Congress charge against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and accused the NDA government of making every effort to dismiss the Constitution in the last 10 years.In her 32-minute speech, Priyanka Gandhi was combative yet restrained, never raising her voice, as she raised the opposition's key issues including BJP's alleged attempts to change the Constitution, ""growing monopoly"" of the Adani Group, atrocities on women, incidents of violence in Sambhal and Manipur and the demand for a nationwide caste census.Priyanka's mild but effective style once again brought to fore the similarities that she share with her grandmother Indira Gandhi. When asked about her speech, Congress leader and brother Rahul Gandhi said, ""Wonderful speech ... Better than my maiden speech, let us put it like that.""Dressed in a dark blue saree, Priyanka stood up in the House after union minister Rajnath Singh and spoke with ease and clarity, just like her grandmother, drawing from her personal meetings with victims of the Unnao rape case and the Sambhal violence.The Congress leader spoke in Hindi and raised the issue of recent violence in Sambhal and Manipur, Lok Sabha results and the Constitution to corner the BJP government. Unlike brother Rahul, who is often seen speaking in an extempore manner and using theatrical tactics like using placards, images, and a Constitution copy to get attention, Priyanka stood straight in the fourth row with glasses on and spoke only from the written material.She diverted only once, to call out a member as she spoke about the alleged custodial death of Arun Valmiki in Agra in October. ""Aap hass rahe hai, lekin yeh gambhir baat hai (You are laughing but this is a serious matter),"" she said before continuing her speech.Priyanka's maiden speech was also a continuation of Rahul Gandhi's earlier speeches as the leader of the opposition in Lok Sabha. Like her brother, she invoked religions -- Hinduism, Islam, Buddism, Sikhism -- to point out that conversation and debates have been part of our culture for thousands of years.Like Rahul Gandhi, she also accused the BJP of creating ""atmosphere of fear"". ""BJP cannot maintain unity, we saw it in Sambhal and Manipur. They have created an atmosphere of fear,"" Priyanka said.Earlier in his first speech as leader of the opposition in Lok Sabha, Rahul had also invoked the image of Lord Shiva with the snake around his neck and accused BJP and creating an ""atmosphere of fear and violence inside the Chakravyuh"" to entrap common people re-iterated ‘Daro Mat, Darao Mat’ (Don't fear, don't create fear).Extending the same sentiment, Priyanka said, ""Today people are intimidated from speaking the truth. Be it a journalist or an opposition leader or a university professor everyone's mouth is shut. Opposition leaders are investigated by ED, CBI, IT and are sent to jail by making false allegation.""""This government has spared no one. Their media machine spreads lies and makes accusations,"" she said.Priyanka Gandhi also pointedly questioned BJP's accountability, particularly their habit of attributing issues to Jawaharlal Nehru, while delivering a sharp critique of its frequent criticism of India's first prime minister.""Our Constitution laid the foundation of economic justice, distributing land to farmers, the poor and the needy.... Whose name is often used by them (BJP) to save themselves, he (Jawaharlal Nehru) created many PSUs and institutions such as HAL, BHEL, SAIL, GAIL, ONGC, NTPC, Railways, IIT, IIM,"" she said.She emphasised that while her great-grandfather's name could be removed from textbooks, his contributions to India's independence and development remain indelible.Regarding the Emergency, she suggested the BJP should acknowledge and express regret for their missteps.""My colleague in the ruling party recounted the past, this happened, that happened... what happened in 1975. You also learn from it, you also apologise for your mistakes,"" she said.Priyanka Gandhi also issued a challenge to the BJP to conduct elections using ballot papers, suggesting this would reveal the true situation.The Congress leader criticised the prime minister's approach, stating, ""There used to be a story that the king used to go among the people in disguise to listen to criticism. Today's king is also very fond of changing his disguise... But he neither has the courage to go among the public nor to listen to criticism.""""The 'suraksha kavach' of unity is being broken. The prime minister touches his forehead to the Constitution but when there are cries for justice from Sambhal, Hathras and Manipur, there is not a wrinkle on his forehead,"" the Wayanad MP said.""It seems Prime Minister Modi hasn't understood that 'Bharat ka Samvidhan' is not 'Sangh ka Vidhan',"" Priyanka Gandhi said.",Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra took the centre stage in Lok Sabha with her maiden speech in Parliament. She led the Congress charge against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and accused the NDA government of making every effort to dismiss the Constitution. Her mild but effective style once again brought to fore the similarities that she share with her grandmother Indira Gandhi.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116293191,imgsize-1133835,width-400,resizemode-4/116293191.jpg"

NEW DELHI: There was pandemonium in Rajya Sabha on Friday as BJP MPs clashed with opposition members over the no-confidence motion against Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar who himself had an angry exchange with LoP Mallikarjun Kharge , before the House was adjourned for the day.As Congress MPs accused him of behaving in an extremely partisan manner, Dhankhar said, ""I'm a farmer's son and will not show any weakness."" He added, ""I will sacrifice my life for my country. You (opposition) have only one job 24 hours a day. Why is a farmer's son sitting here? Look at what you are saying. I have tolerated a lot...

You have a responsibility to run the House but you are purposely encouraging them,"" he said.Dhankhar hit back, saying ""the whole world knows whose praise you like"". He said the opposition was targeting him because of the ""category"" he came from.Earlier, several MPs from the treasury benches accused Congress leaders of insulting the son of a farmer. They said that while there was a provision for bringing a no-confidence motion against the chairman, a 14-day notice had to be given before a discussion on the issue. ""They are entitled to bring a motion against me. This is their constitutional right but they are deviating from the constitutional provisions. I have gone through everything that is projected through the public domain. Why cannot we follow the Constitution?"" the chairman said. Dhankhar later asked Kharge and leader of the House J P Nadda to see him in his chamber later in the day so that the logjam in the House could be ended before adjourning the proceedings till Monday.","Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar had an angry exchange with LoP Mallikarjun Kharge before the House was adjourned for the day.

The remarks about ""defilement"" of the Constitution came amid comments from other parties that there were serious questions about the independence of judiciary under BJP government .Slamming BJP's repeated reference to Emergency, Sena UBT MP Arvind Sawant said the way Constitution was being ""played"" now, there was an ""undeclared Emergency"" in force and there was no need to impose one. He said BJP should not forget that four SC judges had alleged that govt was interfering in judiciary's functioning.Sawant said while anti-defection law was shredded in Maharashtra, SC judges could not show courage to stop it. ""Was Constitution respected... illegal govt was allowed to function, CM was sworn in. Case had to be decided during its tenure, but Speaker didn't disqualify anyone. What happened to SC order? What happened to Constitution & Ambedkar?"" he asked, adding, ""Is the judiciary independent? Cowards are sitting there.""","Former CJI D Y Chandrachud came in for stinging criticism from Sena UBT.

Mumbai e-bus crash: Police suspect bus driver may have 'deliberately' used vehicle as 'weapon',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mumbai-e-bus-crash-police-suspect-bus-driver-may-have-deliberately-used-vehicle-as-weapon/articleshow/116181711.cms,"NEW DELHI: Mumbai Police on Tuesday sought custody of a civic transport bus driver involved in a accident that killed seven people and injured 42 in Mumbai, arguing they need to investigate whether the act was ""deliberate"" and if the vehicle was used as a ""weapon.""The court granted the police's request, remanding the accused, Sanjay More (54), to custody until December 21.The fatal crash occurred on Monday night around 9:30 pm on SG Barve Marg in Kurla (West), when an out-of-control electric bus operated by the Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) undertaking ploughed into pedestrians and vehicles.The accident left four policemen, on duty at the scene, injured and damaged 22 vehicles.Locals apprehended Sanjay More after the crash and handed him over to the police after thrashing him. He was subsequently arrested and booked under Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) sections, including culpable homicide not amounting to murder, voluntarily causing hurt using dangerous weapons, and endangering public safety.The police, in court, stressed the need to determine if the accused intended to commit the crime and whether a conspiracy was involved. They also highlighted the necessity to investigate More’s qualifications, including his training to operate electric buses and whether he was under the influence of narcotics.Opposing the remand plea, More’s lawyer, Samadhan Sulane, argued that the accident could have resulted from a ""technical fault"" in the bus and emphasized the administration’s responsibility to ensure the vehicle’s roadworthiness.According to police, More had no prior experience driving electric vehicles and had undergone only a ten-day training before starting to operate BEST’s electric buses from December 1.Initial interrogation revealed More was mentally alert, and primary medical reports indicated he was not under the influence of alcohol.The ill-fated 12-metre-long bus, manufactured by Hyderabad-based Olectra Greentech, is under examination by forensic experts and transport officers to rule out mechanical failure as a cause of the accident.The injured are receiving treatment at various municipal hospitals, with some in critical condition. Meanwhile, BEST has formed a committee led by Chief Manager (Transport) Ramesh Madavi to probe the incident.BEST officials reported that the bus’s speed accelerated uncontrollably during the accident.
