EPS and PM Modi is meeting for the first time since the AIADMK and BJP renewed their alliance.The meeting came amid the war of words between the allies ahead of the 2026 Tamil Nadu Assembly elections. Earlier, EPS ruled out a coalition government with the BJP and said, “Our alliance would achieve a grand success in 2026.

""Stalin claims that the DMK alliance will win 200 seats. Instead, the AIADMK alliance will win in 210 seats.AIADMK will form the govt with an absolute majority,"" he said.The ruling DMK has attacked the AIADMK for reviving ties with the BJP, saying that the saffron party would swallow EPS. EPS fired back and replied, ""Stalin says BJP will swallow Palaniswami. Is Palaniswami a worm to be swallowed by a fish? You are the one swallowing many of your allies. Congress has diminished, Communists have disappeared, and VCK is sticking around with DMK.""EPS also rebutted the criticism that AIADMK will be divided by BJP. ""Stalin is warning us that AIADMK will break and that I should be careful. I would like to tell him that AIADMK will not break,"" EPS said.The AIADMK and BJP came together for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. AIADMK walked out of the NDA in 2023, accusing Annamalai of insulting its leaders.

What's in a name? 22 days in jail & a 17-year legal battle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/whats-in-a-name-22-days-in-jail-a-17-year-legal-battle/articleshow/122929705.cms,"Punish cops whose error cost man 17yrs of suffering: Court

AGRA: Rajveer Singh Yadav was never the man police meant to arrest. It was his brother Ramveer they wanted. But one clerical mistake - a swapped name - landed Rajveer behind bars for 22 days. While cops admitted to the error within weeks, the case dragged on for 17 years in court, wrecking his livelihood, his kids' education, and his peace of mind. Now at 55, Rajveer has finally been acquitted.A Mainpuri court on Saturday declared Rajveer Singh Yadav innocent and ordered action against the policemen whose ""gross negligence"" cost him nearly two decades of suffering.I kept insisting I wasn't the one. But they didn't listen. They just picked me up and sent me to jail,"" Rajveer, father of three daughters and a son, told TOI on Saturday. ""I fought the case for 17 years. At the time, no one even knew who had filed the case - they just saw my name and dragged me in. I couldn't work. I couldn't educate my children. I lost everything.""He added: ""I somehow managed to get my daughters married. My son had to drop out. We were destroyed. I just want the officers who did this to me to be held accountable.At the very least, I should be compensated for what I've gone through.""The case goes back to Aug 31, 2008, when Mainpuri police filed an FIR under IPC section 307 (attempt to murder) and provisions of the SC/ST Act against four men, including Manoj Yadav, Pravesh Yadav, Bhola Yadav, and Ramveer Singh Yadav - all from Nagla Bhant village, Mainpuri - following a clash allegedly linked to an election dispute. The Gangster Act was added soon after.However, when the gang chart was prepared, the then SHO of Mainpuri Kotwali, Omprakash, made a critical error: instead of Ramveer, he listed Rajveer Singh Yadav - Ramveer's elder brother. The investigation was handed over to sub-inspector Shivsagar Dixit, the then SHO of Dannahar police station, Rajveer's lawyer Vinod Kumar Yadav said.On Dec 1 that year, Rajveer was arrested. From jail, he moved a plea before the special Gangster Act court in Agra, insisting that he had been wrongly named. The court summoned the officers concerned. On Dec 22, inspector Omprakash admitted before the judge that Rajveer's name had been ""added by mistake"". The court passed his release order the same day.Judge Mohammed Iqbal, who was then hearing Gangster Act cases, even wrote to the SSP of Mainpuri recommending disciplinary action against the erring cops. But despite the admission in court and the judge's warning, SI Shivsagar Dixit still filed a chargesheet against Rajveer - and the case continued.","Mainpuri court declares Rajveer Singh Yadav innocent and orders action against the policemen whose ""gross negligence"" cost him nearly two decades of suffering.

"Bihar woman faints at home guard test, raped in ambulance",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-woman-faints-at-home-guard-test-raped-in-ambulance/articleshow/122929062.cms,"Police probing why no woman was present in ambulance

GAYA: A home guard aspirant was gang-raped, allegedly by an ambulance driver and a health department technician, while being taken to a hospital after collapsing during a fitness test in Bihar's Bodh Gaya, police said Saturday. Both accused have been arrested and an SIT is probing the case.The woman was one of around 700 candidates undergoing physical evaluation at Bihar Military Police grounds on July 24. She fainted in the scorching heat and was put in an ambulance bound for Anugrah Narayan Magadh Medical College and Hospital about 3.5km away, or a 10-minute drive.Police said the ambulance took an unusually long time to cover the short distance. CCTV footage shows it had deviated from the direct route. At the hospital, the semi-conscious woman told emergency staff she had been raped inside the moving ambulance. ""We informed police. Officers responded to the complaint and initiated medical tests and legal procedures,"" a hospital official said.Police formed an SIT and arrested both accused late Friday. An FSL team collected biological samples. ""We're taking all steps to make the case fool-proof while ensuring her care,"" hospital superintendent Dr K K Sinha said.A senior officer said an FIR has been registered on the basis of the woman's statement. Investigators are examining why no female attendant accompanied the survivor during transit - a lapse that may have enabled the crime.The case has revived memories of a rape at Gaya's Lady Elgin Hospital (now Rani Durgawati Hospital) decades ago, where a former MP was accused.Public outrage surged online, with demands for justice and better protection for women. ""There are cases of small girls aged 4 and even women above 65. Will they get justice? Will girls live fear free in India?"" posted Henrietta Decruz on X, urging Supreme Court intervention.The crime adds to a string of brutal killings in Bihar this July, before assembly elections later this year. On July 17, five gunmen shot a murder convict on parole dead inside a Patna hospital. Businessman Gopal Khemka was gunned down outside his Patna home on July 4. Later, BJP Kisan Morcha ex-president Surendra Kewat, trader Waseem Anwar Khan, and lawyer Jitendra Kumar were also murdered.Opposition parties have seized on the crime wave as proof of govt failure in the run-up to polls.","Home guard aspirant was gang-raped, allegedly by an ambulance driver and a health department technician.

JAMMU: Parallel magisterial and police probes have been launched into circumstances in which Mohammad Parvez, a 21-year-old Jammu resident, was killed alleged “police firing” on Thursday.The case has sparked protests and outrage across J&K with the deceased’s family, BJP and several politicians, including J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah, condemning the Gurjar youth’s killing and demanding an impartial probe. Two constables, Baljinder Singh and Pawan Singh, have been suspended.Police claimed Parvez died in “crossfire” between a team of cops and some drug peddlers they were chasing in Sure Chak of Jammu’s Satwari area late Thursday evening. Parvez’s family and Gurjar leaders have alleged a fake encounter.“Taking serious note, district magistrate Jammu has initiated a magisterial inquiry to ensure a fair and impartial examination of the facts and circumstances leading to the incident. The inquiry officer (SDM Jammu South) has been directed to complete the investigation within two weeks,” an order by DM Sachin Kumar Vaishya reads.Separately, police have set up a special investigation team (SIT) led by an SDPO, Domana Mudassar Hussain, to probe allegations by Parvez’s family.At the same time, a departmental inquiry, led by a DSP, has been started with instructions that the findings be shared with higher authorities.After being hit, Parvez was taken to Jammu’s Govt Medical College (GMC), where he succumbed to his wounds. His last rites were performed Friday in his native Nikki Tawi area of Jammu.“The killing of Parvez is highly unfortunate and deeply regrettable. Use of force by police has to be calibrated and cannot be indiscriminate. This incident should be investigated in a transparent and time-bound manner,” Omar posted on X on Friday. PDP president Mehbooba Mufti also demanded an impartial probe.Senior BJP functionary and former minister Chowdhary Zulfikar Ali said prominent community members in Nikki Tawi had reached out to him and affirmed that Parvez was not involved in any illegal activity. “The community demands a free, fair and unbiased probe,” Ali said.","Mohammad Parvez, a 21-year-old Jammu resident, was killed alleged “police firing” on Thursday.

Explosives Found Near Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah's Event Venue In Bengaluru, Major Attack Foiled





BENGALURU/NEW DELHI: A turf war between Karnataka’s top political bosses spilled over into a dramatic public spat in Delhi on Friday, as aides of chief minister Siddaramaiah and his deputy DK Shivakumar clashed inside Karnataka Bhavan, prompting formal complaints and calls for an inquiry.According to multiple sources, the incident involved C Mohan Kumar, special duty ofﬁcer (SDO) to the CM, and H Anjaneya, SDO to the deputy CM.The confrontation reportedly heated up when Mohan Kumar shouted at Anjaneya, threatening to hit him.This was allegedly said in front of other govt staff.Anjaneya filed a formal complaint with the additional resident commissioner (ARC) and Karnataka chief secretary Shalini Rajneesh, seeking action against Mohan Kumar for issuing threats.In his letter, Anjaneya claimed that if he were to meet any “accident”, then Mohan Kumar would be responsible. The officer went on to claim that Kumar has a history of violence with another person also being hit by him.""I was beaten with a shoe and it has hurt my honour and dignity. Conduct a criminal trial against him (Kumar) and give me justice,"" Anjanaya said in his complaint.“I seek a departmental inquiry against Kumar,” he said in his letter.What started as a verbal dispute between the two aides escalated after women employees at Karnataka Bhavan allegedly accused the DCM’s aide of using unparliamentary language and abusive terms in their presence earlier that day.CMO officials claim the situation worsened when Mohan Kumar confronted Anjaneya over his remarks about the women staff.This confrontation soon degenerated into a full-blown verbal brawl between the two SDOs.Later in the evening, the aggrieved women staff reportedly met Siddaramaiah and expressed concern over the behaviour of the DCM’s officer. Following the meeting, the chief minister directed the ARC to examine the complaint and initiate an inquiry, if necessary.","Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah and his deputy DK Shivakumar's aides clashed inside Karnataka Bhavan.

NEW DELHI: BJP leader and actor Mithun Chakraborty on Thursday dismissed West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee ’s recent claims that Bengali migrant workers were being targeted in other states.Chakraborty termed the remarks as an attempt to stir unnecessary controversy and spread fear among the public.Responding to Banerjee’s concerns over the safety of Bengali-speaking migrants, Chakraborty said, “These are all lies. I opened a hotel in Bengaluru where most of the workers were Bengali migrants. There were no Bangladeshis. But if someone is Bangladeshi, they will obviously be identified as Bangladeshi.”He accused the chief minister of politicising the issue. “She wants to create controversy in everything. Nothing is going to happen. Bangla language will remain as it is. Mamata Banerjee has got no monopoly over it. We will put up a strong fight,” he said.Chakraborty also criticised Banerjee’s call to gherao the Election Commission over alleged voter list tampering in Bengal and Bihar.""She (Mamata) has no other option, but this will definitely happen. The Election Commission must act. Fake and bogus voters have to be removed, only then will elections be fair.Even if the Commission is gheraoed, what will that achieve? What’s the point (of such protests)” he added.The BJP leader’s remarks come amid heightened political tension in West Bengal, with the TMC alleging discrimination against Bengali-speaking citizens and raising concerns over the legitimacy of the electoral rolls and local entrepreneurship.",BJP leader and actor Mithun Chakraborty dismissed West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s recent claims that Bengali migrant workers were being targeted in other states.
