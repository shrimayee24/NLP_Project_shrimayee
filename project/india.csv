Priyanka Gandhi Targets VB-G RAM G Bill Over MGNREGA, Blasts Centre's Name Change Tactics

NEW DELHI: Congress on Tuesday protested both inside and outside Parliament against the ""anti-people"" G RAM G bill, with its MP Shashi Tharoor - who the party has accused of being soft on BJP - taking a dig at the governmentt in Lok Sabha by recalling an old Bollywood number - ""dekho o deewano (tum) ye kaam na karo, Ram ka naam badnam na karo"".Sounding the bugle of ""sansad to sadak"" fight against the rural employment gurantee bill, Congress's Rahul Gandhi alleged that PM Narendra Modi wants to target the secure livelihood of the poor after destroying the future of India's youth through massive unemployment. He said saddling states with 40% financial burden will destroy the foundational principles of the job guarantee scheme - right to work, full central support for wages and 3/4th for material costs and autonomy to villages to decide development works.The prime minister has ""deep dislike"" for the rights of the poor, and MGNREGA is a living embodiment of Gandhi's vision of 'gram swaraj' as a lifeline for crores of rural Indians, Rahul said.""To remove the name of Mahatma Gandhi is to strip the bill of its moral compass and historical legitimacy,"" Tharoor said in Lok Sabha.","Congress protests both inside and outside Parliament against the ""anti-people"" G RAM G bill.

National Herald Case: Court Declines To Act On ED Chargesheet, Congress Claims Truth Has Prevailed

New Delhi: As Congress on Tuesday said court's refusal to take cognisance of the ED chargesheet in the National Herald issue exposed Centre's use of hysteria to hype a hollow case, BJP countered that the court's ruling is no exoneration of Sonia Gandhi and a bail should not be seen as acquittal.Senior lawyer and Congress MP Abhishek Singhvi, who led the legal battle, said the matter never had any merit, but the govt used the media to exaggerate groundless claims. ""It was a strange case where no money was transferred and no property changed hands, but it was called money laundering. Young India, which controls AJL, cannot give any money, dividend or perks to the leaders sitting there. The court did not take cognisance of the case, which is the first step.It shows the case was baseless,"" he said.BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia was quick to point out that the dismissal is procedural and not on merit as there was no finding in favour of the accused. ""The primary criminal case, which originated from the private complaint filed by Subramanian Swamy, alleging cheating, criminal conspiracy, and breach of trust (the predicate offense), is still pending trial in the Court,"" he said.Claiming vindication, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge said when the case was brought by the Modi govt, party leadership said ""if we didn't fear the British, BJP-RSS or Modi-Shah cannot scare us."" He added, ""Today, court too has declared Modi govt's actions illegal and foiled this conspiracy hatched with malicious intent of political revenge. We will continue our fight for 1.4 billion Indians and to save the Constitution.

National Herald Case: Court Declines To Act On ED Chargesheet, Congress Claims Truth Has Prevailed

Can’t sustain ED laundering probe in absence of FIR in Herald case: Court

New Delhi: In a significant relief to Congress netas Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi , a Delhi court on Tuesday declined to take cognisance of Enforcement Directorate 's prosecution complaint - equivalent to a police charge sheet - in the National Herald money laundering case.In a 117-page order, special judge Vishal Gogne held that the probe was ""impermissible in law"" as it was not based on an FIR, a prerequisite to register an investigation under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The court, however, allowed ED to carry out its investigation based on the FIR registered by the Delhi Police's economic offences wing on Oct 3, which the agency brought to the judge's notice.The court also turned down the plea by the Gandhis that they be given a copy of the police FIR, saying they were not entitled to it at this stage of the probe.Special Judge Vishal Gogne ruled that an investigation and the consequent prosecution complaint related to the offence of money laundering cannot be sustained in the absence of an FIR.The court further observed that “in the present origin of the allegations, a public person, namely Subramanian Swamy , instituted the complaint under Section 200 of the CrPC (Code of Criminal Procedure). He is not a person authorised to investigate the offence mentioned in the schedule (Section 420 of IPC)”, thereby underlining the legal infirmity in ED’s prosecution complaint.So, the court said, “It is now premature and imprudent for the court to decide the submissions made by ED as well as the proposed accused in relation to the merits of the allegations.”The court also took strong note of the way ED initiated proceedings in the matter. It noted that despite receiving Subramanian Swamy’s complaint and the summoning order in 2014, CBI has not registered an FIR in relation to the alleged scheduled offence till date. However, ED “simply inverted the template of money laundering being consequential to the predicate offence by recording its own ECIR (enforcement case information report) on June 30, 2021. ”Judge Gogne said ED overreached into CBI role and violated PMLA framework. “This act was not a mere expression of the independent nature of ED as an agency to probe proceeds of crime” but instead reflected a “unilateral overreach of the other law enforcement agency viz. CBI on one hand and an ill-advised out pacing of the scheme of the PMLA itself”.The court also noted that money laundering cases cannot be initiated unless an FIR is registered by the “law enforcement agency concerned”, pointing out that such complaints “by public persons bring forth a limited spectrum or volume of evidence” and an even more “constricted tool kit for facilitating investigation” of the allegations. In effect, the court clarified that a complainant under Section 223 of the BNSS (Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita) cannot conduct any investigation akin to police or other probe agencies.The case pertains to the acquisition of Associated Journals Limited (AJL), publisher of the now-defunct National Herald newspaper.","The case pertains to the acquisition of Associated Journals Limited (AJL), publisher of the now-defunct National Herald newspaper.

Owaisi Calls SIR a ‘Backdoor NRC’ in Lok Sabha, Warns of Selective Religious Disenfranchisement

NEW DELHI: Leader of the House J P Nadda on Tuesday asked the opposition parties to come together to back special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral roll, while pointing out how West Bengal has seen a massive spike in its electorate from 4.8 crore to 7.6 crore since the last SIR in 2002.Citing ECI data during the debate in Rajya Sabha on electoral reforms, Nadda said the minimum increase in voters list of the 9 West Bengal districts bordering Bangladesh was 70% since 2002, while the maximum had crossed 100%. He shared that Uttar Dinajpur has witnessed the highest spike in electors at 105.5%, Malda at 94.8%, Murshidabad at 87.6%, 24 Parganas at 83.5% and Jalpaiguri at 82.3%.“In West Bengal, the total increase in (numbers of ) a particular community is 7.5%,” he said while asking the members why the Election Commission should not go about its mandate to detect the illegal immigrants who may be responsible for this spike.“Should they not be detected, deleted and deported?” he asked.He concluded the debate by saying that the discussion on such serious issues should not rest on political considerations, but on what is important for the nation. “We must ponder on whether the country should be run as per the mandate from illegal immigrants or as per the mandate of its citizens?” he said and sought the cooperation of all parties in EC’s SIR drive to weed out non-citizens from the rolls.Nadda mocked the opposition for criticising EC as ‘vote chor’, drawing attention to Rahul Gandhi’s 16-day ‘vote adhikar yatra’ during SIR in Bihar. “He toured 25 districts but the Congress was wiped out in 21 of these 25 districts (in Bihar polls). The Congress ended up with 6 seats and the Mahagathbandhan alliance, with all of 33 seats.DMK’s Tiruchi Siva got up during Nadda’s speech to clarify that the opposition was not against SIR per se but the manner in which it was being done.Participating in the debate earlier, Trinamool Congress MP Derek O’ Brien accused the government of using SIR to divide people, so as to distract and deflect from its failures.Referring to home minister Amit Shah’s remark in Lok Sabha to “detect, delete, deport” illegal immigrants as a matter of NDA govt policy, Derek said the actual D’s are for “divide, distract and deflect”.He said it was the home minister, and not the chief minister, who was in charge of the borders and preventing infiltration.The debate had on Monday seen Congress leader Randeep Surjewala arguing how electoral reforms strike at the heart of India’s freedom struggle and constitutional democracy, warning that any dilution of voting rights or institutional independence would hollow out the republic from within. “If universal voting rights, free and fair elections by an independent Election Commission, and constitutional institutions are weakened, democracy becomes an illusion,” he said.","West Bengal has seen a massive spike in its electorate from 4.8 crore to 7.6 crore since the last SIR in 2002.

(With agency inputs)

PATNA: A complaint has been filed at Kaiserbagh Police Station in Lucknow against Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar and Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Sanjay Nishad over a viral hijab video, which sparked outrage among political leaders across party lines, criticizing Nitish Kumar’s actions.The complaint was filed by Samajwadi Party leader Sumaiya Rana, along with her lawyers, requesting the registration of an FIR and strict legal action against both leaders.The complaint relates to a viral video in which Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar is allegedly seen pulling a Muslim woman’s hijab during an official event distributing appointment letters to newly appointed AYUSH doctors. The incident has sparked strong criticism from political leaders, who have described it as inappropriate and humiliating.Speaking to ANI, Sumaiya Rana said the act set a dangerous precedent. ""A video of Bihar CM Nitish Kumar is going viral on social media in which he is seen pulling down a woman's hijab. For a person holding a constitutional position to behave in this manner means he is encouraging his other workers to engage in similar acts,"" she said.Rana also objected to the controversial remarks made by UP minister Sanjay Nishad. Quoting him, she said, ""He said, 'Why is there so much controversy over removing a burqa? His hands only touched her face.If his hands had touched somewhere else, what would have happened then?' Based on this, I have filed a complaint.""Advocate Misham Zaidi, who accompanied Rana, said the incident and the subsequent remarks attract serious penal provisions. ""He has hurt the modesty of a woman. What Sanjay Nishad has done incites religious sentiments. This is a clear-cut case under Section 153A, as you are knowingly engaging in such acts that could instigate riots, create unrest, and disturb the law and order of the state,"" he said.He further added, ""Section 354 will be applied to him (Nitish Kumar) directly for grabbing and pulling it (the hijab).""","A complaint has been filed at Kaiserbagh Police Station in Lucknow against Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar and Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Sanjay Nishad.
