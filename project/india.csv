Quit as MPs: BJP attacks Gandhis again on Bofors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/quit-as-mps-bjp-attacks-gandhis-again-on-bofors/articleshow/119509733.cms,"BJP on Tuesday demanded the resignation of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi as MPs, citing a book by a journalist, who is credited with exposing the alleged Bofors scam , to claim that the two Congress netas were linked with Italian middleman Ottavio Quattrocchi .BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia claimed the “huge revelations: made by Chitra Subramaniam in her book ‘Bofors Gate’ are worrisome, and alleged that Quattrocchi used his proximity to the then PM Rajiv Gandhi and his wife Sonia Gandhi to pull strings in finalising defence deals.”It has long been alleged that Quattrocchi, who is no more, enjoyed warm ties with Sonia, who is also of Italian origin, and used it to his business advantage in India. He was one of the accused in CBI’s long-winded probe into the alleged bribery in the Bofors gun deal after the kickback was first reported by the Swedish state radio in 1987.Bhatia alleged that defence files during Rajiv’s term would be taken to Quattrocchi so that he could change them to favour companies of his choice. The current Congress leadership, including party chief Mallikarjun Kharge, should answer if it was no violation of oath by Rajiv, he said at a press conference.He alleged that Quattrocchi’s bank accounts were defrozen by CBI in 2005 during Congress-led UPA rule at the behest of Sonia. “Sonia and Rahul should resign from their position till they make a full disclosure about their family’s relations with Quattrocchi. Till then, they have no right to remain MPs.”","Journalist Chitra Subramaniam is credited with exposing the alleged Bofors scam.

FIR filed against Kamra



'I will not apologise'



Political leaders react



Another video by Kamra in response



Sanjay Raut defends Kamra



'Freedom of expression has limits': Shinde



More allegations and threats against Kamra



NEW DELHI: A stand-up comedy performance by Kunal Kamra ignited a political storm in Maharashtra, leading to violent protests, legal action, and heated exchanges among political leaders. His latest show, which was released online on Sunday, included sharp jabs at Maharashtra deputy CM Eknath Shinde , provoking outrage among the Shinde-led faction of Shiv Sena Kamra’s sharp political commentary included a parody of a popular Hindi song from 'Dil Toh Pagal Hai', in which he referred to Shinde as a ""gaddar"" (traitor). His jokes also touched upon recent political turmoil in Maharashtra, including the splits between Shiv Sena and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP).The performance provoked an immediate reaction from Shinde’s Shiv Sena faction. Party workers stormed the Unicontinental Hotel’s Habitat Comedy Club Studio on Monday, ransacking the venue in protest against Kamra’s remarks.The police responded, arresting Shiv Sena functionary Rahul Kanal and 11 others for the attack. However, a magistrate’s court granted them bail the same day.Amid the uproar, an FIR was registered against Kamra in Thane district for allegedly defaming Eknath Shinde. The case, filed at Dombivli police station by a Shiv Sena functionary, charges Kamra under Section 356(2) (defamation) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.Despite the backlash, Kamra remained defiant. He issued a strong response on the same day as the vandalism, refusing to apologize. ""I will not apologise,"" he clarified in a post on X, taking aim at both the ""mob and politicians"" who were outraged by his jokes.The row quickly rocketed into a political slugfest, with leaders from different parties weighing in. Maharashtra minister of state for home Yogesh Ramdas Kadam condemned Kamra’s comments, warning of consequences.""He will be punished. If you are going to insult the Supreme Court, PM of India, Hindu Gods and Goddesses, it is not tolerable. You cannot behave like this in Maharashtra or India... We do enjoy comedy, but this is not the kind of comedy that will be tolerated in Maharashtra,"" Kadam said.Kamra, in turn, responded with another satirical video on Tuesday, mocking the Shiv Sena workers who vandalised the comedy club. He posted a clip of himself singing ""Hum Honge Kangaal"", interspersed with footage of the destruction caused by party workers.Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut came out strongly in support of Kamra, arguing that the comedian would not bow to pressure.""I know Kamra. We share the same DNA. He is a fighter,"" Raut told reporters. ""He won’t apologize. If you have to act against him, you have to take recourse to lawful steps.""His comments provoked a sharp reaction from Maharashtra Minister Yogesh Kadam, who retorted, ""The DNA of Kamra and Raut could be the same. He (Kamra) is mad, and so is this person (Raut).""BJP MLC Parinay Phuke also weighed in, alleging that Kamra was being supported by opposition parties. ""The Congress or other parties are supporting Kamra. Their DNA must be the same because the DNA of scoundrels is the same,"" he said.Eknath Shinde himself responded to the controversy, defending freedom of expression but warning against its misuse.""Right to express is important in a democracy, but to say anything in the guise of it and on the instruction of somebody is wrong,"" he said. ""He said many things about PM Modi, CJI, FM Sitharaman, HM Shah. He has been saying such things. Many airlines have banned him. Who is behind him? I don’t worry, there have been many allegations against him. I don’t support the vandalism of the studio—that was due to the emotions of the party workers. This looks like a well-thought-out conspiracy.""Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath, in an exclusive interview with ANI, addressed the issue, saying, ""Freedom of expression should not be misused as a tool for attacks. Unfortunately, some people treat free speech as their inherent right to create divisions and further polarise the country.""Adding to the row, Shiv Sena MP Naresh Mhaske alleged on Tuesday that Kamra had been paid to make such statements as part of a conspiracy to divert attention from the Disha Salian case .""It does not matter whether Kunal Kamra apologises or not, he has talked about our leader, our worker will give him 'prasad', it does not matter whether is sweet or bitter, he will himself tell about that. He will get the reaction of Shiv Sena,"" he said.""Kunal Kamra has been given money to make such statements to divert people's attention away from Disha Salian’s case. Uddhav Thackeray and Sanjay Raut are left with no workers, which is why they are putting forward people like Kunal Kamra,"" Mhaske told ANI.He also issued a veiled threat, warning that Kamra would not be able to move around freely in Maharashtra.""He will face the reaction as Shiv Sena is a party of reaction. We are Shiv Sainiks, and if someone talks rubbish about our leader, we will not tolerate that. We are ready to face all the consequences, but Kunal Kamra cannot roam freely in Maharashtra and India,"" Mhaske said.","Kunal Kamra's latest show included sharp jabs at Maharashtra deputy CM Eknath Shinde.

NEW DELHI: Karnataka home minister G Parameshwara on Tuesday said the state government will determine the course of action and type of probe into the alleged ""honeytrap"" attempt on cooperation minister K N Rajanna after consulting legal experts and chief minister Siddaramaiah.The statement followed Rajanna’s formal request for action, in which he described encountering unfamiliar individuals and raised concerns about whether they acted independently or had external backing.The decision came hours after Parameshwara told reporters in Bengaluru that Rajanna had yet to file a complaint on the matter.""I will file a complaint today and submit it to the home minister because I had spoken about it in the Assembly and had said I would do so. Until today, I was unable to write the complaint due to various work-related commitments,"" Rajanna said.Speaking to reporters, he added, ""I have personally written the complaint and will submit it to the home minister today. I'm getting it typed... I will go wherever the home minister is and hand it over. I have detailed everything that happened in a three-page complaint.""Initially dismissing the issue as a common occurrence, Rajanna said he took it seriously after his name was mentioned in the Assembly.""I have not installed CCTV cameras in my Bengaluru house. If they were there, we could have identified who came and went,"" he said.He mentioned that the individuals involved were strangers and stressed the need to investigate whether they acted alone or had backing.Among those who allegedly attempted to ""honeytrap"" him, Rajanna said the same man appeared both times, but the woman accompanying him was different on each occasion.""The woman who came the second time claimed to be a high court lawyer. However, she was not wearing a lawyer's coat but was dressed in jeans and a blue top. They approached me, stating they had something important and confidential to discuss. I can recognise them if I see their photos,"" he said.Last Thursday, Rajanna had informed the Assembly that honeytrap attempts were made on him and that at least 48 politicians across parties had fallen victim to such schemes.The revelation sparked a stir in the Assembly, prompting the home minister to announce a high-level probe while the opposition demanded a judicial inquiry by a sitting high court judge.Reacting to a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed in the Supreme Court, Rajanna dismissed claims that he had mentioned judges in his statements.""Have I said anything about judges? I haven't. I only said that such attempts have been made on political leaders from all parties by their opponents to settle political scores. I never mentioned judges. Yet, someone has filed a PIL claiming that I did and that the case should be handed over to the CBI,"" he said, calling the petition misleading and based on ""false information.""Asked about his travel plans, Rajanna said he would visit Delhi after March 30.When questioned about informing the Congress high command, he replied, ""The matter has already reached the high command. They have not asked me anything personally, so I haven't spoken to them. However, they have gathered information on their own and have spoken to the chief minister about it.""Addressing concerns about discussing the issue in the Assembly, Rajanna admitted he should have brought it up within the cabinet or party first but felt compelled to speak after BJP MLA Basangouda Patil Yatnal mentioned his name while referring to alleged ""honey trapping"" attempts.","Karnataka home minister G Parameshwara said the state government will determine the course of action and type of probe into the alleged ""honeytrap"" attempt on cooperation minister K N Rajanna.

NEW DELHI: Trinamool Congress MP Kalyan Banerjee on Tuesday accused Union agriculture and rural development minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan of working for the wealthy and acting as a ""dalal (broker) for the rich"".He criticized the Union government for not releasing central funds to West Bengal under schemes like MGNREGA and PMAYG .Speaking to reporters outside Parliament, Banerjee alleged that funds had not been given to West Bengal for three years. He claimed this was because the BJP could not form a government in the state.""Shivraj Chouhan is a 'dalal' (broker) for the rich. He doesn't work for the poor and that's why he was removed from the post of Madhya Pradesh chief minister,"" Banerjee said. He repeated the remark multiple times.During Question Hour in the Lok Sabha, MPs from the DMK and Trinamool Congress protested against what they said was a delay in MGNREGA payments to some states. The Speaker adjourned the session until noon.Banerjee, in his statement, further alleged that the Centre’s claim about 25 lakh fake job cards under MGNREGA was being used as a reason to withhold funds. He said, ""They have not given us funds for the last three years. They are saying there are some discrepancies... (that) there are 25 lakh fake job cards (under MGNREGA)... We have told them to carry forward criminal proceedings against the fake cards, but they can't deprive 10 crore people of West Bengal of the funds.""He claimed that the BJP’s failure to win West Bengal in the 2021 assembly elections was the reason for the delay in funds. ""Shivraj Chouhan and PM Narendra Modi are against Bengal. They want to form a government there and are failing. They will never come to power there. BJP leaders say don't give funds to Bengal,"" he said.The BJP responded, with minister of state for agriculture Bhagirath Choudhary demanding an apology for the remarks made against Chouhan. ""This is not a good thing, such language by a senior MP does not suit him. PM Modi is working on the principle of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas'. There is no discrimination against any state and everyone is getting their share,"" Choudhary said while talking to news agency PTI.He also said, ""Unfortunately, the West Bengal government changes the names of central schemes and indulges in corruption.

NEW DELHI: AIADMK general secretary and Tamil Nadu's former CM Edappadi K Palaniswami reached Union home minister Amit Shah's residence in New Delhi on Tuesday.Palaniswami's visit to Shah's house comes at a time when rumours are rife that ex-allies may come together to fight assembly polls next year.In September 2023, the AIADMK made a decisive break as it severed ties with the BJP, ending an alliance that had been riddled with tension. AIADMK leaders were reportedly frustrated with the BJP’s growing ambitions in Tamil Nadu and its leaders' controversial remarks about Dravidian icons like Periyar.With the 2024 Lok Sabha elections approaching, AIADMK announced it would go solo, determined to carve its own path without the BJP’s influence. But this wasn’t the first time their alliance had fallen apart.In 2019, AIADMK, still recovering from the death of Jayalalithaa, joined hands with BJP to take on the rising DMK-Congress front. The results were disastrous—the alliance won just 1 seat, while the DMK swept Tamil Nadu. Despite the setback, AIADMK stuck with the BJP for the 2021 Tamil Nadu Assembly elections, where they lost again, securing only 75 out of 234 seats. The BJP, a junior partner in the coalition, managed to scrape by with 4 seats.The roots of their alliance go long back to 1998. Under Jayalalithaa’s leadership, AIADMK first joined forces with the BJP-led NDA. It was a successful experiment, bringing them 30 out of 39 seats in Tamil Nadu. But within a year, Jayalalithaa withdrew support, toppling Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s government.Since then, their relationship had been anything but steady. AIADMK kept shifting between alliances and independence, sometimes partnering with the BJP, sometimes choosing to stand alone.","Palaniswami's visit to Shah's house comes at a time when rumours are rife that ex-allies may come together to fight assembly polls next year.

Boxing Federation of India elections ‘paused’ due to legal hurdles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/boxing/boxing-federation-of-india-elections-paused-due-to-legal-hurdles/articleshow/119330505.cms,"Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

NEW DELHI: Facing legal hurdles after disgruntled member state associations approached courts, the Boxing Federation of India ’s ( BFI ) forthcoming elections were on Friday “paused” by Returning Officer RK Gauba after incumbent Ajay Singhled governing body informed the RO that it is seeking urgent intervention against the “contradictory orders” issued by the judiciary.The BFI’s elections are scheduled for March 28 in Gurugram.“The president of the BFI has communicated...since these orders have the potential to disrupt the ongoing electoral process/schedule, we are taking steps to approach the superior courts for urgent intervention. Therefore, it’s requested that further orders be awaited before the conflicting orders of the high courts are acted upon,” Gauba quoted Singh as saying in his order.The RO – a former Delhi high court judge – said that the election process would remain paused until the federation informs him of the steps taken in response to the court orders.“Thus, the process is paused till BFI informs of the action taken in the wake of the court orders,” Gauba wrote.Two days ago, the Delhi High Court had stayed the federation’s March 7 directive signed by Singh that “only duly-elected members of BFI’s affiliated units are authorised to represent their respective states in the elections”.The court had ruled on a petition filed by the Delhi Amateur Boxing Association (DABA), paving the way for its office-bearers Rohit Jainendra Jain and Neeraj Kant Bhatt to vote in the BFI’s annual general meeting (AGM) as Delhi boxing body’s representatives.On Thursday, another ruling by the Himachal Pradesh High Court allowed former sports minister Anurag Thakur to contest the BFI’s presidential election by staying his disqualification from the electoral college based on the March 7 circular, and directed Gauba to include the senior BJP leader’s name as one of the representatives from the Himachal boxing body to enable his candidature.It’s been learnt that the Maharashtra state boxing association has also filed a writ petition before the High Court of Judicature at Bombay, impleading the RO to stay the elections.",Boxing Federation of India ’s forthcoming elections were on Friday “paused’ by Returning Officer RK Gauba.

NEW DELHI: Boxing Federation of India’s (BFI) elections are heading towards an intriguing finish.Incumbent Ajay Singh and the opposing faction challenging his presidential candidacy are exercising every conceivable strategy to outmanoeuvre each other in this high-stakes electoral contest.After the initial triumph of having rejected former sports minister Anurag Thakur ’s bid to contest the federation’s elections following an unexpected office directive and suspending secretary general Hemanta Kalita and treasurer Digvijay Singh on allegations of corruption and favouritism, Singh-led BFI has been compelled to confront successive setbacks within a span of two days through various court orders, yielding the advantage to their opponents.On March 7, the Delhi high court had stayed the federation’s directive that only bonafide and duly-elected members of BFI’s affiliated units are authorised to represent their respective states in the forthcoming elections, scheduled for March 28 in Gurugram. The court had ruled on a petition filed by the Delhi Amateur Boxing Association (DABA), paving the way for its office bearers Rohit Jainendra Jain and Neeraj Kant Bhatt to vote in the BFI’s annual general meeting (AGM) as Delhi boxing body’s representatives.On Thursday, another ruling by the Himachal Pradesh high court allowed Thakur to contest the BFI’s presidential election by staying his disqualification from the electoral college based on the March 7 circular and directed Returning Officer – former Delhi high court judge R K Gauba – to include the senior BJP leader and four-time Lok Sabha MP’s name as one of the representatives from the Himachal boxing body to enable his candidature.A single judge bench of Justice Ajay Mohan Goel directed the BFI to extend the last date of submission of nominations so that Thakur can file his papers whilst permitting him to represent the Himachal Pradesh Boxing Association (HPBA) in the AGM and “fully participate therein”.Justice Goel ruled that the electoral college approved by the RO on March 12 and 13, which left out Thakur, “is prima facie bad and not sustainable in law”“In this backdrop, balance of convenience is also in favour of the petitioners and if interim, as prayed for by the petitioners is not granted, then irreparable loss shall be caused to them. As an ad-interim measure, this court stayed the operation of notice, dated 07.03.2025, as well as the rejection of nomination of one of the two nominated members namely, Mr. Anurag Singh Thakur. It also goes without saying that the election process will be subject to the final outcome of this writ petition or any other order that may be passed by the court in this application,” the order stated.The court ruled that prima facie, it was evident that the March 7 order by Singh was issued “without any authority and without any power”.Thakur was declared ineligible on the grounds that he wasn’t an elected member of the HPBA and can’t represent the state in the BFI’s AGM. The HPBA maintained that Thakur was an elected member of the state unit since 2008 and served “in different capacities, including chairman”.HPBA’s president Rajesh Bhandari will be another representative from the state, along with Thakur.Reacting to the development, a BFI source close to president Singh’s camp said that the next course of action will be decided after going through the 34-page order. “A lot will now depend on the RO. We have received both the court orders and the BFI’s legal team will go through them. We will certainly challenge them in the respective courts,” added the source.",Boxing Federation of India’s (BFI) elections are heading towards an intriguing finish.
