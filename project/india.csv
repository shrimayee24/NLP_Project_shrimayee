NEW DELHI: Coming out in support of the leader of opposition in Lok Sabha on his alleged ""vote theft"" claims, Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Friday said that the questions raised by Rahul Gandhi needed to be ""seriously addressed.""""These are serious questions which must be seriously addressed in the interests of all parties & all voters,"" the Thiruvananthapuram MP said while sharing the fellow party leader Rahul Gandhi's video explaining how ""Bangalore central Lok Sabha seat was stolen"".Tharoor further said, ""Our democracy is too precious to allow its credibility to be destroyed by incompetence, carelessness or worse, deliberate tampering. Election Commission must urgently act & should keep the nation informed.""Shashi Tharoor expressed support after Rahul Gandhi, in a press conference on Thursday, shared what he described as ""concrete evidence"" of large-scale electoral manipulation, alleging that the Election Commission collaborated with the BJP to ensure the ruling party’s win.Tharoor’s comments signaled a change in tone, following several months in which his statements, including praise for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and criticism of the Emergency period, imposed by former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, had drawn criticism from within the Congress and were used by the BJP to target the grand old party.Gandhi, the Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha, also made explosive claims of a ""huge criminal fraud"" in polls through collusion between the BJP and the Election Commission.Alleging that a ""vote chori model"" was being used in many constituencies across the country, Gandhi said that the judiciary needs to get involved in this because ""the democracy that we love so much, does not exist anymore"".He claimed that there was ""vote chori"" (stealing of votes) of 1,00,250 votes in the Mahadevapura segment, with 11,965 duplicate voters, 40,009 voters with fake and invalid addresses, 10,452 bulk voters or single address voters, 4,132 voters with invalid photos and 33,692 misusing Form 6 of new voters","Congress leader Shashi Tharoor said that the questions raised by Rahul Gandhi needed to be ""seriously addressed"" Gandhi, in a press conference on Thursday, shared what he described as ""concrete evidence"" of large-scale electoral manipulation.

""Else, they will keep reminding him to submit these at the earliest, so his claims can be investigated,"" said a commission official.""Rahul should either sign the declaration and preferably post it on social media, or stop misleading the people with baseless allegations against EC. Why is he running away from signing the oath, which is being sought in accordance with the rules? The law is the same for a politician and any other citizen,"" the official told TOI.Rule 20(3)b of the Registration of Electors Rules, 1960 states that the registration officer may require that the evidence tendered by a person regarding wrongful inclusion/exclusion from the roll, be given on oath.The evidence sought from Rahul under his oath must include the name of the person cited for inclusion/exclusion, his part number of electoral roll and his serial number in the roll. Rahul must also declare that he understands that presenting false evidence or making a false declaration in connection with the electoral roll shall invite a jail term of up to three years (seven years if the false claims are repeated in court) under Section 227/229 of BNS and up to a year's imprisonment under Section 31 of the Representation of the People Act, 1950.The Karnataka CEO is due to meet a Congress delegation in Bengaluru on Friday. Sources said he would insist on a signed declaration before the alleged ""voter fraud"" can be probed.Notwithstanding the allegations, the election results in the three states will hold since the window for filing a challenge via an election petition is long over. Significantly, Congress was given copies of the draft as well as final electoral roll for Karnataka, Haryana and Maharashtra ahead of the last LS/assembly polls, but not a single appeal was filed against entries in the final roll at the level of the district magistrate or the CEO.Incidentally, a Congress govt was in office in Karnataka during the annual summary revision of the Karnataka roll ahead of the LS polls. The officials involved in roll revision - electoral registration officers (EROs), assistant EROs, booth level officers (BLOs), etc - are essentially state govt officials, though under the superintendence of EC for the duration of the roll update.","Chief electoral officers of Karnataka, Maharashtra and Haryana say they will initiate the necessary proceedings after he declares under oath that he believes the wrongful inclusions and exclusions cited by him to be ""true to the best of his knowledge and belief"" The CEOs are expecting to receive the signed declarations from Rahul by Thursday evening.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123175763,imgsize-1236714,width-400,resizemode-4/123175763.jpg"

NDA's strength is around 422, comfortably above the majority mark of 391.Asked if NDA will reach out to opposition to evolve a consensus on the next vice-president, Rijiju told reporters that as of now, Modi and Nadda have been authorised to identify the alliance's candidate.The opposition INDIA bloc already hinted at fielding its candidate. ""There are certain conventions. If opposition parties come and discuss with us, we will always discuss with them.

Honeymoon turns horror: How Sonam plotted husband Raja's murder in Meghalaya

BENGALURU: A quiet Thursday morning turned into a scene of horror near Chimpaganahalli in Tumakuru district when a stray dog emerged from the bushes carrying a severed human arm in its mouth, shocking a passerby.The man, frozen in disbelief, watched as the dog casually crossed the road between Koratagere and Kolala, the mangled limb dangling from its jaws. Once he recovered from the shock, he dialled 112, triggering what would become a chilling murder investigation in the heart of home minister G Parameshwara's constituency.Police were horrified to discover mutilated human body parts scattered across five locations within a 3-km radius. What they found included two arms, two palms, a lump of flesh and parts of intestines — all in varying states of decay. The head was missing, deepening the mystery.""The remains appear to have been discarded recently, but decomposition had already set in,"" said a senior police officer. A forensic team from Bengaluru and dog squads were deployed as investigators scrambled to piece together the crime scene.While preliminary probe suggests the victim is a woman, confirmation will depend on bone and tissue examination, police said.

The ADJ court also imposed a fine of Rs 71,000 on him.ADGC Manoj Sharma said the matter came to light after the survivor gathered courage and reached the local police station with her mother on May 3, 2019, to file a complaint against her father's conduct. Based on her complaint, an FIR was registered under IPC sections 376 (rape), 323 (voluntary causing hurt) and 506 (criminal intimidation). Pocso wasn't invoked in this case as the child was an adult at the time of complaint, the ADGC added.In her statement before the magistrate under section CrPC 164, she stated: ""When I was 12 (in 2012), my dad started raping me and married me off in April 2014 when I got pregnant and delivered a child.

He also claimed his ""daughter had a premarital relationship with her husband, and the child was a result of that.
