Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren was arrested during his visit to the Raj Bhavan by central agencies. CM requested that he should not be arrested in Raj Bhavan. He will come out and surrender.

Amit Shah accuses INDIA bloc's VP candidate of supporting Naxalism; targets him with 2011 judgment - what he said,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amit-shah-accuses-india-blocs-vp-candidate-of-supporting-naxalism-targets-him-with-2011-judgment-what-he-said/articleshow/123453145.cms,"Why INDIA Bloc Chose Justice Sudershan Reddy as Its Vice President Pick Against NDA's Radhakrishnan

What was Salwa Judam judgment?



NEW DELHI: If the Congress-led India bloc's Vice President candidate, B Sudershan Reddy, had not delivered the Salwa Judum judgment, the extremist Left movement in the country would have ended before 2020, Union home minister and senior BJP leader Amit Shah on Friday accused his of ""supporting"" Naxalism.Speaking after inaugurating the Manorama News conclave organised by the Malayala Manorama group in Delhi, Shah remarked that the Congress party’s chances of winning in Kerala had further diminished due to its choice of candidate for the Vice-President post.""Sudershan Reddy is the person who helped Naxalism. He gave Salwa Judum judgment. If the Salwa Judum judgment had not been given, the Naxal terrorism would have ended by 2020. He is the person who was inspired by the ideology that gave Salwa Judum judgment,"" PTI quoted Shah said during a question-and-answer session at the conclave.The statement refers to the December 2011 Supreme Court judgment by Justice Reddy, which ruled that using tribal youths as Special Police Officers—whether called 'Koya Commandos', Salwa Judum, or by any other name—in the fight against Maoist insurgents was illegal and unconstitutional, ordering their immediate disarmament.Shah added that Kerala had borne the brunt of Naxalism.""People of Kerala will certainly see that the Congress party, under the pressure of Left parties, is fielding a candidate who supported Naxalism and used a pious forum like the Supreme Court,"" he asserted.The ruling NDA had selected Maharashtra Governor C P Radhakrishnan, a seasoned BJP leader from Tamil Nadu with an RSS background, as its vice-presidential candidate.In 2011, Reddy gave a landmark judgment which declared the controversial Salwa Judum militia in Chhattisgarh as unconstitutional.The Salwa Judum, which was accused of human rights abuses, was a state-sponsored militia raised in 2005 to counter Maoist insurgency. It comprised largely tribal youth armed with basic training and firearms.The militia was later disbanded. His ruling, rooted in the protection of fundamental rights, underscored that state-sponsored vigilantism could not replace constitutional policing. In Nandini Sundar versus state of Chhattisgarh, the bench led by Justice Reddy held that arming tribal youth as special police officers under Salwa Judum was illegal and unconstitutional.",Justice Sudershan Reddy is the Congress-led India bloc's Vice President candidate.

This is the same person who, driven by ideology, used a sacred platform like the Supreme Court to pronounce such a verdict,"" Shah said at the Manorama News Conclave.He was referring to the then SC judge's 2011 ruling declaring Salwa Judum, an armed tribal group formed to counter Maoists in Chhattisgarh, unconstitutional.Shah also addressed the controversy surrounding the Constitution (130th) Amendment Bill, saying it was imperative to ensure by law that the country's PM or the CM of any state doesn't get to run a govt from jail.Later at Tirunelveli, Shah described Tamil Nadu's DMK govt as the ""most corrupt in the country"" and said CM MK Stalin, who was ""striking shady deals and indulging in dark deeds"" had no right to criticise the bill as a ""black bill"".Speaking at BJP's first regional booth committee meeting in Tirunelveli, Shah said the loud objection to the bill from opposition parties was not based on logic. ""Opposition parties question the need for the bill. Then DMK ministers K Ponmudi and V Senthil Balaji remained in jail for eight months each but did not resign. Tell me, can a govt be run from jail?"" Shah asked.He also reiterated there would be a coalition govt in the state after the 2026 elections, a position stridently opposed by key ally AIADMK.He, however, did not mention AIADMK general secretary Edappadi K Palaniswami in his speech.","Congress backs retired Justice B Sudershan Reddy as vice-presidential candidate despite knowing his ""ideological support"" for Naxalism.

NEW DELHI: After the united outrage by opposition against the Constitution amendment bill that provides for automatic sacking of ministers and CMs jailed for 30 days, INDIA bloc is forced to wait to nominate MPs to the parliamentary panel to scrutinise the legislation in view of Trinamool Congress 's reluctance to join it.Sources said TMC was pushing for boycott of the JPC, but the rest of the opposition wanted to be on the panel to ensure that Modi government did not get a free run on ""the weapon to target the opposition-ruled states"".Congress, which is sure to get 4-5 seats on the panel, and allies are waiting for TMC to convey a final decision, sources said, adding that DMK and SP, too, have conveyed their willingness.The issue flared up at an INDIA bloc meeting Wednesday, when the three bills tabled by home minister Amit Shah triggered a fracas in Lok Sabha. A senior TMC neta advocated that the opposition should stay away from the JPC. But the argument was countered by a smaller party member who said that JPC was the only platform where the opposition could make an alternative case and even register dissent. The Trinamool member underlined that govt ultimately has its way, like in the JPC on Waqf bill. However, in response, it was pointed out that the JPC proceedings served a big purpose as Supreme Court mentioned them in its hearings on the challenge to the Waqf (Amendment) Act.While the opposition managed to stay united in the monsoon session, the three bills presented on the penultimate day created some fissures.
