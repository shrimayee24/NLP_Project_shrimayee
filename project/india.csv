AHMEDABAD: Congress MP Rahul Gandhi called for a purge within the party's Gujarat unit, vowing to remove functionaries working covertly for BJP. Addressing party workers in Ahmedabad, Gandhi admitted Saturday that Congress had failed to meet public expectations in the state and stressed the need for an overhaul.""Gujarat is stuck and wants to find a way, but Congress in Gujarat is not in a position to show the way,"" he said. ""I am not ashamed or scared to say that we have not met the expectations of the people of Gujarat.""He highlighted that Congress still holds a 40% vote share in Gujarat and suggested that a modest increase could bring the party back to office. ""One out of every two persons in Gujarat is a Congress supporter. If we can increase our vote share by just 5%, Congress will come to power in the state,"" he said.Gandhi drew a sharp distinction between Congress members dedicated to the party's ideology and those who he accused of being disconnected from the people or colluding with BJP.""There are two types of people in the Gujarat Congress leadership and among workers,"" he said. ""One section is honest with the people, fights for them, respects them, and carries the Congress ideology in their heart. The other section is cut off from the people, does not respect them, and half of them are hand-in-glove with BJP.""He emphasised that without eliminating BJP loyalists within the party, public trust could not be regained.Gandhi urged Congress politicians at all levels to demonstrate complete loyalty to the party's ideology. ""They should carry Congress in their blood. Put the issue of winning and losing the elections aside. As soon as we do that, the people of Gujarat would like to join our organisation, and we will open the door for them,"" he said.His visit concluded with preparations for an AICC session, scheduled in Ahmedabad on April 8 and 9 - the first such session in the state in 64 years.Congress has struggled with defections in Gujarat before elections over the past decade. The party lost ground in 2012 assembly elections, 2017 Rajya Sabha polls when Ahmed Patel barely secured victory, and subsequent state and general elections. Its worst performance came in 2022 assembly elections, after which four more legislators defected, leaving Congress with just 12 seats in the assembly.State Congress president Shaktisinh Gohil affirmed that BJP ""sleeper cells"" (loyalists) in Congress would soon be identified. ""In the coming days, we will ensure that loyal Congress workers get leadership opportunities and not those who get elected on a Congress ticket but work for BJP,"" Gohil said.Congress MLA and Dalit activist Jignesh Mevani said: ""Only those Congress workers who will strongly fight against BJP for the rights of local communities will get leadership and tickets at all levels.""",Congress MP Rahul Gandhi calls for a purge within the party's Gujarat unit.

Partying without masks: Gujarat HC junks FIR against cops,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/partying-without-masks-gujarat-hc-junks-fir-against-cops/articleshow/118813194.cms,"Representative image

AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court quashed an FIR filed against policemen in Kutch for partying without wearing masks during the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.In this case, six police personnel gathered for the birthday party of one Virendra Purohit, who is also a policeman, at a resort on May 15, 2021.A video of their party went viral after a few days, and the Anjar police registered an FIR on May 28, 2021, against the six for violating the Covid restrictions.They were charged under IPC sections 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 188 (violation of govt notification), for violating the Gujarat Epidemic Disease Covid-2019 regulations and the Disaster Management Act.The FIR stated that the accused, being responsible police officials, committed the alleged offence.A month after the FIR was registered, the policemen approached the high court and contended that it was no offence because they gathered in a closed room, and the Covid-19 guidelines also permitted restricted gatherings during the pandemic.The state govt opposed the petition and relied on the video of their party to argue that Covid rules were violated by the police officials.They also contended that Section 195 of CrPC places a bar on the registration of an FIR. The proper procedure to invoke the sections and laws requires the filing of a complaint before a magistrate by a competent authority.After hearing the case, the HC said that the FIR faces a bar of Section 195 of CrPC because Section 188 of IPC was invoked.The HC further stated, ""After hearing the learned advocates for the respective parties and perusing the contents of the FIR, this court is of the considered opinion that the complainant has tried to misuse the machinery of criminal law... It is found out from bare perusal of the allegations and accusations levelled against the applicant herein are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety, in that event, they do not prima facie constitute any offence or make out a case against the accused as the basic, essential and requisite ingredients for the alleged offences are missing.""","The Gujarat high court quashed an FIR filed against policemen in Kutch for partying without wearing masks during the Covid-19 pandemic.
