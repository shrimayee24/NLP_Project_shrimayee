Arrested Rajasthan PSC member leaked papers: SIT,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/arrested-rajasthan-psc-member-leaked-papers-sit/articleshow/116951506.cms,"JAIPUR: Arrested Rajasthan Public Service Commission ( RPSC ) member Babu Lal Katara not only handed over six sets of 2021 SI exam question papers to commission colleague Ramu Ram Raika, but also leaked these to Udaipur-based govt accountant Purushottam Dadhich who allegedly circulated the papers for profit a full month before the exam.This new detail, revealed in a SIT report exclusively accessed by TOI, belies the earlier perception that Katara's leak was limited to Raika's family. The test was held on three days, from Sept 13 to 15, 2021, during the tenure of Ashok Gehlot-led Congress govt. SIT has recommended cancellation of the test results. The state's current BJP govt is yet to take a decision on it. Some unsuccessful candidates have filed a plea for cancellation in Rajasthan HC, which has sought govt's stand.The SIT report confirms the leak originated from RPSC headquarters in Ajmer. Previously, it was believed that Katara provided question papers for Raika's son Devesh and daughter Shobha only, both of whom were arrested while undergoing SI training.Since Dadhich is absconding, it is not clear how many others received the leaked papers from him. Additionally, the SIT suggests Dadhich may have shared the papers with some coaching centres.The new revelation emerged after the SIT arrested candidate Renu Kumari last year. She received Hindi and GK papers three days before the exam from Dadhich. ""Katara provided Dadhich with six sets of question papers,"" the SIT report states.On Saturday, Rajasthan police said directions had been issued to suspend all 45 trainee SIs arrested in the leak case. SIT has arrested 45 trainees since March 2024. Of these, 25 were released on bail, while the rest remain in judicial custody. Some were scheduled to begin assignments.The SIT report pointed out that the previous Congress govt rushed and wrapped up SI appointments by Oct 3, 2023, days before model code for assembly elections later that year came into force.In another damning revelation, the SIT has accused RPSC of stonewalling its probe into the matter.","RPSC member Babu Lal Katara handed over six sets of 2021 SI question papers to colleague Ramu Ram Raika.
