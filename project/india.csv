During rallies and public addresses, members of both the BJP , the party in power, and the INC , the principal opposition party, have asked important questions relating to the core of our constitutional democracy . The Prime Minister has publicly challenged the Congress on reservations, Article 370 and wealth redistribution. Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge has questioned the Prime Minister on possible mutilation of the Constitution, Electoral Bond scheme and the government's response to China, and also challenged him to a public debate. Both sides have asked each other questions about their respective Manifestos, as well as their stand on the constitutionally protected scheme of social justice,"" the letter read.The former judges and journalist also said that it will be great if public listen to their responses and this is the reason a public debate would set a great precedent, not just by educating the public, but also in projecting the true image of a healthy and vibrant democracy.""To this end, we believe that citizens would hugely benefit by hearing directly from our political leaders through a public debate on a non partisan and non commercial platform. It would be ideal if the public heard not just the questions of each side, but also the responses. We are of the view that this would help to strengthen our democratic process immensely,"" as per the letter.""Accordingly, we respectfully request the two of you, as leading voices from the two sides that seek the peoples' mandate, to a public debate with each other on the key issues of this election. The venue, duration, moderators, and format of the debate could be on the terms agreeable to both sides. We trust you will consider our request positively. We also suggest, and only if either of you is unavailable to address this debate, you may nominate a representative to the debate,"" the letter added.Madan B Lokur is a former judge of the Supreme Court, while AP Shah is a former chief justice of Delhi high court.

"Wasn’t raped, Sandeshkhali ‘survivor’ says in video",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/wasnt-raped-sandeshkhali-survivor-says-in-video/articleshow/109989710.cms,"As clips emerge, TMC asks: Did BJP mislead Prez on Sandeshkhali?

SANDESHKHALI: An older video of BJP ’s Basirhat candidate Rekha Patra purportedly suggesting that some of the Sandeshkhali “rape survivors” taken to Delhi to meet President Murmu may have been “paid to impersonate” Thursday added grist to Trinamool ’s allegations about the unrest in this Bengal pocket being engineered by the saffron party.Patra’s video, part of an interview she had given to a TV channel before her nomination, surfaced along with another clip showing one of the “survivors” telling a reporter that BJP members made her sign a blank sheet of paper without disclosing what it was for.She denied facing sexual assault or visiting a police station to lodge a complaint, reports Sanjib Chakraborty.Rekha Patra, who filed her nomination for the Basirhat seat Thursday — Sandeshkhali is part of the constituency — declined comment on the controversy. TMC’s counter-attack started with two videos that emerged last week, one of them of a purported sting. The party presented this as “evidence” of BJP’s Bengal brass, including Nandigram MLA Suvendu Adhikari, allegedly instigating or intimidating several women from Sandeshkhali into filing concocted rape complaints.TMC moved Election Commission, seeking custodial interrogation of everyone featuring and being named in the videos. The sting purports to show BJP’s Sandeshkhali Block-II chief Gangadhar Koyal admitting that the “Sandeshkhali movement” was Adhikari’s brainchild and that the rape complainants did what they were told to.On Wednesday, the first of the “survivors” did an about-turn, saying she faced no such assault and that local BJP members forced her to sign a blank sheet of paper and approach police. She complained of threats and a social boycott because of her decision to withdraw the allegedly false charge of rape.The other “survivor” who came clean is seen in the video telling reporters a local BJP Mahila Morcha member identified as Piyali, aka Mampi Das, took her and some others to meet a team from National Commission for Women.In the oldest of the clips, BJP candidate Patra refers to 11 people from Sandeshkhali, including five women, meeting Prez Murmu on March 11. “We are the real victims, we are still in Sandeshkhali. Then who are those who were taken to Delhi to meet Rashtrapati Madam? Nobody informed us before the meeting,” she is heard saying.Two other women, including BJP worker Piyali, purportedly feature in the same video.“We learned only from the media that some women were taken to Delhi to meet Prez. Anup Das (a fellow BJP worker), who used to be paid Rs 10,000 by Trinamool’s Shibaprasad Hazra a month, took these women to Delhi,” Piyali tells the reporter.Anup wasn’t available for comment, but Bengal BJP spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya defended him. “Anup has been with BJP for over a decade and has helped the Sandeshkhali survivors get legal assistance. He didn’t do anything wrong. (Rekha) Patra joined BJP after the Sandeshkhali movement,” he said.Bengal’s BJP co-minder Amit Malviya argued that Patra never suggested that crimes didn’t take place in Sandeshkhali. “First attempt was to put out a fake, AI-generated video, claiming that the movement was orchestrated and funded (by Adhikari),” he wrote on X.Trinamool accused BJP brass of spinning “a web of lies and deceit”.“Can we say that BJP even misled Prez? How could the delegation from Sandeshkhali go and meet Murmu without the approval of the party leadership? To what depravity will BJP plunge for some votes?” state finance minister Chandrima Bhattacharya said.Sandeshkhali police issued notice to BJP worker Piyali under Section 41A of CrPC asking her to report at the local police station within three days. Another complaint was lodged at the police station against BJP candidate Patra and Koyal.","Trinamool accused BJP brass of spinning “a web of lies and deceit” TMC moved Election Commission, seeking custodial interrogation of everyone featuring and being named in the videos.

'Abuse of due process of law': Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal's lawyers object to ED's affidavit against interim bail,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/abuse-of-due-process-of-law-delhi-cm-arvind-kejriwals-lawyers-object-to-eds-affidavit-against-interim-bail/articleshow/109988718.cms,"NEW DELHI: Contesting ED's affidavit opposing interim bail in the Supreme Court , Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal ’s legal team highlighted the absence of incriminating evidence after two years of investigation into the alleged liquor scam. They argued that the ED heavily relied on statements from individuals associated with the BJP, casting doubts on the impartiality of the investigation.Kejriwal’s legal team also filed a formal complaint with the Supreme Court, suggesting that the ED's affidavit is a legal violation as the case is already scheduled for a final decision in the SC tomorrow and the affidavit was submitted without prior approval from the SC.“Some of these statements do not even indicate the commission of money laundering or any predicate offence. All of the evidence against Arvind Kejriwal as shown in the Grounds of Arrest have come after the arrest of all these people, leading to a suspicion that the arrest has been systematically used as a device to coerce statements against Shri Arvind Kejriwal,” AAP said in a statement.Kejriwal's arrest on March 21, 2024, just days after the announcement of general elections and during the model code of conduct, sparked allegations by the party of political ‘conspiracy’ behind the move. The AAP claimed that the arrest tilted the electoral playing field in favor of the ruling BJP, compromising the principles of free and fair elections.AAP contended that the statements provided by the witnesses followed a pattern where Kejriwal was not implicated initially, but was later named after repeated objections from the ED regarding their bail. They accused the ED of selectively ignoring statements that did not implicate Kejriwal, suggesting a bias in the investigation process. The party cited examples such as Magunta Sreenivasulu Reddy, who received an NDA Lok Sabha ticket, facilitating his son's bail through a statement. Another person, P Sarath Reddy, allegedly transferred Rs 60 crores to the BJP's account through electoral bonds to secure his own bail.AAP said that there is no evidence implicating any AAP leader in the alleged illegal activities, pointing out that the ED itself admitted Kejriwal's non-involvement in certain proceedings. The party denounced Kejriwal's arrest as a blatant disregard for due process and the rule of law.","Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s legal team highlighted the absence of incriminating evidence after two years of investigation into the alleged liquor scam.

"Why state Congress invited Gandhis to contest from Khammam, turning it into a hot seat",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-state-congress-invited-gandhis-to-contest-from-khammam-turning-it-into-a-hot-seat/articleshow/109992258.cms,"HYDERABAD: Khammam , which was just another Telangana parliamentary constituency, became the most prestigious seat after the state Congress leadership passed resolutions urging Sonia Gandhi, later Rahul Gandhi and finally Priyanka Gandhi to contest from here.While none of the Gandhis accepted the proposal, the seat became the most sought after in Telangana with three strong ministers from the district seeking the ticket for their family members, and the Congress high command denying all three.All eyes will be on Khammam when the 17 Lok Sabha seats in Telangana go to the polls on May 13. Congress has not won this seat in the past 15 years but has performed exceedingly well in the assembly elections. The grand old party has fielded R Raghuram Reddy, BRS has nominated its sitting MP Nama Nageswara Rao and BJP, which is trying to expand its footprint here, has fielded Tandra Vinod Rao.The seat generated a lot of political heat with the three ministers, including deputy chief minister Bhatti Vikramarka, standing their ground firmly for a ticket to their family members. Even Telangana Congress president and chief minister A Revanth Reddy and other ministers in his cabinet went all out to request Sonia to field either Rahul or Priyanka as an escape route to avoid rubbing any of the three ministers the wrong way.Of these ministers, Bhatti belongs to the SC community, revenue minister Ponguleti Srinivas is a Reddy and agriculture minister Tummala Nageswara Rao is a Kamma, a community that is financially & politically influential in the constituency and the district.What started as an attempt by the state Congress to get one of the Gandhi family members to contest gradually turned into a difficult proposition to finalise the candidate. Both the party and CM Revanth were aiming to consolidate their positions after the party won 64 assembly seats, four more than the simple majority to form govt. Congress had won six of the seven assembly segments in Khammam, with CPI, a pre-poll ally of Congress, bagging Kothagudem, the lone seat it contested in 2023 assembly polls.Even the party high command sat on finalising the candidate for the seat for more than a month after releasing its first list of four candidates for Telangana, and announced R Raghuram Reddy's name with only a day left for the nomination. This was done after inviting Bhatt Vikramarka and Ponguleti Srinivas to Bengaluru where AICC president Mallikarjun Kharge brokered peace between them after settling the issue over phone with agriculture minister Tummala Nageswara Rao.All the three ministers assured the party leadership of working for the candidate finalised by the high command. Raghuram is the son of Ramasahayam Surender Reddy, a former Congress MP close to the Nehru-Gandhi family. Raghuram's son is married to Aashritha, daughter of actor D Venkatesh who is from Kamma community, his second son is wedded to the daughter of Ponguleti Srinivas Reddy. The grand old party is banking on Raghuram's Reddy-Kamma link and its performance of winning all the seven assembly segments along with CPI, and even the support of the CPM, to win the seat, which it had last won in 2004. Political equations have changed a lot as Ponguleti had won this seat on a YSRCP ticket in 2014, later joined BRS and is now in Congress.Though BRS failed to win a single assembly seat in this parliamentary constituency, it is confident of retaining Khammam as the party had won it in 2019 after victory in only one of the seven assembly segments in the 2018 state polls.On the other hand, BJP is expanding its footprint with top leaders like home minister Amit Shah having addressed a public meeting in the constituency. BJP leaders are confident of opening their account in Khammam, stating LS election is a different ball game and that Modi's magic, Ayodhya's Ram temple and ""double engine sarkar"" will play a role in deciding the fate of candidates.","Khammam was just another Telangana parliamentary constituency.

Old Pawar vs Vikhe Patil feud at play in Ahmednagar's NCP(SCP)-BJP contest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/old-pawar-vs-vikhe-patil-feud-at-play-in-ahmednagars-ncpscp-bjp-contest/articleshow/109991906.cms,"NASHIK: On the face, it looks like an NCP (SCP) versus BJP contest in Ahmednagar but it's actually a replay of the decades-old political rivalry between the Pawars and the Vikhe Patils, which has come down to the third generation.When they were with Congress, Sharad Pawar and Balasaheb Vikhe Patil , an eight-time MP from the region, were in a tussle over controlling sugarcane cooperative societies.As Pawar's stature grew within the party, he allegedly played a key role in denying Balasaheb the party ticket to contest the 1991 Lok Sabha polls. Angry, the latter fought as an Independent but lost to Congress's Yeshwantrao Gadakh. He even moved the Bombay HC, accusing Gadakh and Pawar of electoral malpractices and maligning his image.The bitter feud between the two families continued after Balasaheb's death.In the run-up to the 2019 polls, his son, Radhakrishna, lobbied hard to ensure that Congress got Ahmednagar in the seat-sharing talks with NCP (then undivided). He was keen to field his son, Sujay, but Pawar was adamant not to part with it. Sujay then joined BJP and won the seat. Days later, his father came to the saffron party's fold.In the 2024 polls, the political veterans are at it again.Radhakrishna, a state minister, even admitted at a recent campaign rally that ""the fight in Ahmednagar is between BJP and Sharad Pawar"".Pitted against Sujay, a neurosurgeon and current MP, is Nilesh Lanke who the senior Pawar has ""poached"" from his rebel nephew's faction.A couple of months after NCP suffered a vertical split last July, Sharad Pawar assigned the party's Ahmednagar district unit chief, Rajendra Phalke, the task of getting back Lanke, one of the four MLAs who had defected to Ajit Pawar's camp. ""Pawar saheb had zeroed in on the Parner legislator as the party's face for the LS seat much before his nephew broke away with a group of legislators. Considering Lanke's popularity and strong connection with voters, senior Pawar was convinced that he would be the party's best bet to wrest the constituency from BJP,"" Phalke told TOI.In the next five months, Phalke recalled, he held a series of secret meetings with Lanke. ""Senior Pawar and Lanke, too, talked over the phone. Finally, Lanke resigned as an MLA and joined NCP (SCP) in the last week of March.""Despite the constituency being a BJP stronghold since 2009, the contest this time will be a tough one, a local BJP politician said. ""Lanke is giving sleepless nights to Sujay, unlike in 2019, when the latter had a cakewalk against NCP nominee Sangram Jagtap.""Senior Vikhe Patil, a prominent face in BJP state unit, has skipped campaigning elsewhere and is focusing on his son's victory. Not lagging far behind is Sharad Pawar, who has already held three rallies and is slated to address at least a couple more before the constituency goes to the polls on May 13.Amid this neck and neck race, Sujay recently stoked a controversy after he targeted Lanke for the latter's inability to speak fluently in English and Hindi. ""One should know how to speak in English or Hindi to raise issues in Parliament. I challenge my opponent (Lanke) to speak fluently in these two languages. I am ready to give him a month,"" he said at a rally.Lanke shot back and said he was proud of his mother tongue Marathi. ""Hard work beats money and muscle,"" he wrote on X.One of the main grievances against Sujay is that after becoming an MP in 2019, he remained ""inaccessible"" not only to voters but also to his own party cadres. ""Sujay has alienated a section of party cadres who toiled hard to ensure his victory five years ago. This time, many of them are not working for him wholeheartedly,"" another BJP politician said.Also, there are internal squabbles within the party's district unit. In March, deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis had to intervene to end the acrimony between Ahmednagar BJP MLC Ram Shinde, and the father-son duo. Shinde blamed the Vikhe Patils for his defeat in Karjat-Jamkhed in the 2019 assembly polls. Opposing Sujay's candidature, the working committee member of the state BJP's SC and OBC Morcha, Sunil Rasne, resigned from his post.In contrast, Lanke has been helping villagers with their health and education needs through his NGO. His loyalists say he takes people's calls even at odd hours. ""During the pandemic, Lanke had set up a Covid care centre with more than 1,000 beds at Parner. The patients were provided free treatment and food. This pushed his popularity among villagers,"" a close associate of Lanke said.For his part, Lanke said he is not wealthy like his opponent, but he has the blessings of people. ""Sujay has not done anything to provide water to villages and neither has he implemented any development projects. There is resentment against him.""It is BJP's organisational strength that could work to Sujay's advantage. Its two allies, NCP and Shiv Sena, too, have large pockets of followers in the constituency.","Sharad Pawar and Balasaheb Vikhe Patil were in a tussle over controlling sugarcane cooperative societies. In the run-up to the 2019 polls, Radhakrishna lobbied hard to ensure that Congress got Ahmednagar in the seat-sharing talks with NCP.

But I want to tell (Telangana CM) Revanth Reddy that this time around we are going to win more than 10 seats. This double-digit score is going to make Modi-ji cross the 400 mark,” Shah said.Shah alleged that Congress , BRS and AIMIM want to run Telangana based on Sharia and the Quran. Referring to the three parties as a “triangle of appeasement”, Shah alleged: “Congress and BRS cannot stop AIMIM. These parties don’t let the Ram Navami procession take place and they also oppose CAA. These leaders don’t even allow the celebration of Hyderabad Liberation Day (Sept 17).”He added that if BJP gets more than 10 seats in Telangana, it would end reservation for Muslims in the state and share the benefits among SCs, STs and OBCs.Alleging that Congress is using lies to fight the election, he said, “They are saying that if Modi comes, he will remove reservation. He was in power with a full majority for the previous two terms and did not remove reservation.”“However, in Telangana, the Congress govt granted 4% reservation to Muslims by plundering SC, ST, and OBC quotas,” Shah claimed. TOI had reported earlier that the 4% reservation in the two Telugu states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana is over and above the reservation for the other castes and is included in Backward Classes (E) category.“Rahul baba’s guarantee will not survive even until sunset. Congress does not keep commitments. PM Modi ensured that the Ram mandir was built within five years, whereas Congress delayed this issue for 70 years. By ending terrorism and Naxalism in the country, Modi ensured the safety of the country,” Shah said.He said Rahul did not meet the promise of giving Rs 5,000 guarantee-free loans to students, scooters to college girls, and opening one international school in every tehsil. He alleged that Congress wanted to revive triple talaq if they returned to office.",Union home minister Amit Shah asked people on Thursday to vote for Narendra Modi and make BJP cross 400 Lok Sabha seats.

Kanshi-Mulayam ‘lab’ now matrix of shifting loyalties,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kanshi-mulayam-lab-now-matrix-of-shifting-loyalties/articleshow/109993830.cms,"ETAWAH: Along the border with Madhya Pradesh, Etawah , with a rich tapestry of diverse communities and clashing ideologies, is a microcosm of Uttar Pradesh’s political kaleidoscope. Days before the constituency goes to the polls, the city pulsates with the echoes of its storied political past and the aspirations of its resilient populace.Under the relentless summer sun, Munna Lal, a weathered Dalit elder, shares his reflections, his voice carrying the weight of history.Making a reference to the Yamuna, Chambal, Sind, Kwari, and Pahuj rivers, which all converge in Etawah, Lal says, “Sahab (Bahujan Samaj Party founder Kanshi Ram) kehte thhe ki in nadiyon ki tarah Dalit agar jud jaye to unhe koi na hara paye. (Sahab used to say that if Dalits come together like these rivers, no one can defeat them…).Lal, hailing from Bhadpura village, a bastion of the Dalit community in Etawah, identifies as a Jatav, a subgroup to which BSP president Mayawati also belongs. Recalling his encounters with Kan shi Ram, Lal describes him as a towering figure with a commanding presence. “I only met him twice,” he reminisces. “However, his ideologies no longer hold sway over the Dalit community. Our voting patterns have diversified, resulting in the fragmentation of our collective influence. We’ve lost our pivotal role in shaping election outcomes here,” he laments.Lal’s words unravel the tale of Etawah’s political metamorphosis, once hailed as the crucible of the alliance between BSP and Samajwadi Party (SP). In 1991, Kanshi Ram’s electoral triumph — with the help of Samajwadi Janata Party leader and later Samajwadi Party founder Mulayam Singh Yadav — in the then unreserved seat of Etawah stood as a beacon of hope for the traditionally persecuted Dalits.It was a time when the Ram Janmabhoomi movement was at its peak, and his victory over BJP’s Ram Singh Verma, Janta Party’s Ram Singh Shakya, along with 45 other candidates, was orchestrated on the foundation of Dalit-OBC solidarity, defying the prevailing winds of saffron ascendancy and reshaped the contours of UP’s political landscape. The rallying cry of ‘jude Mulayam, Kanshi Ram, hawa mein ud gaye ‘Jai Shri Ram’ (With Mulayam, Kanshi Ram in a pair, ‘Jai Shri Ram’ chant van ished into thin air)’ echoed across the region.The Etawah experiment was a precursor to the momentous SPBSP alliance of 1993, which effectively halted the saffron wave. However, in 1996, following the dissolution of the SP-BSP alliance in 1995, Shakya, who had jumped ship to SP, reclaimed the seat.Etawah’s journey from Kanshi Ram’s triumph to the present day is a narrative of alliances forged and fractures exposed. Three decades later, in 2019, history seemed to repeat itself when SP under Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati’s BSP forged an alliance. However, political endeavour fell short as BJP candidate and former SC/ST Commission chairperson Ram Shankar Katheria, hailing from the Dhanuk community, triumphed over BSP-backed SP candidate Kamlesh Kumar.Lal believes the sands have shifted, and the fissures within the Dalit electorate have widened. Lamenting about the 1999 polls, Lal says “We all vote differently now, leading to divisions. We are no more a decisive force in elections.”Now, with the political carousel spinning again, Katheria has reentered the arena, his sight set on retaining the seat. SP has fielded Jitendra Kumar Dohare, who defected from BSP in 2020, as the INDIA candidate. BSP charts its own path by nominating ‘Etawah ki beti’ Sarika Singh Baghel, an ex-RLD MP from Hathras. A certain Mulayam Singh is also in the race as an Independent. The battleground is Etawah, where each candidate vies for the support of the diverse electorate.Dalits, Yadavs, Lodhs, Brahmins, and Thakurs — Etawah’s demographics is a complex portrait of shifting allegiances. Yet, beneath the surface of caste equations lies a yearning for progress, for a politics that transcends identity and delivers tangible, positive change. Lal’s Bhadpura village is a simulation of this paradox. Its dusty lanes bear witness to years of neglect as residents grapple with poverty amid political promises. Gauri Shankar’s disillusionment resonates: “There are no jobs, no schools, no hospitals here... Yet these politicians make lofty claims.”The neighbouring Kunera village, a bastion of the Yadav community, stands in stark contrast, its prosperity attributed to its unwavering support to SP. Nitin Yadav’s loyalty speaks volumes: “We vote for the party, not the candidate. The cycle (SP symbol) is our only hope.”Another couple of miles away, Pachavali village reverberates with the fervour of BJP loyalists. Vidya Ram Rajput’s conviction is unyielding: “The SP-BSP alliance is a non-starter... only BJP offers stability and progress.”As election day looms, Etawah braces itself for a reckoning — a clash of ideas, ideals and ideologies that will shape its destiny for years to come. In this crucible of democracy, where rhetoric meets reality, the ultimate victor remains uncertain.","Etawah is a microcosm of Uttar Pradesh’s political kaleidoscope.

"JJP joins Congress in seeking Haryana floor test, but 3 of its own MLAs 'meet' Khattar",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jjp-joins-congress-in-seeking-haryana-floor-test-but-3-of-its-own-mlas-meet-khattar/articleshow/109992977.cms,"4 MLAs indicate may not follow JJP whip

CHANDIGARH: Pressure mounted on the Nayab Singh Saini govt in Haryana Thursday to take a floor test , with JJP 's Dushyant Chautala closing ranks with Congress and INLD to write to governor Bandaru Dattatreya for his ""intervention"" against the backdrop of BJP's refusal to acknowledge its loss of majority after three Independent MLAs withdrew support to the coalition.Dushyant upped the ante amid murmurs of a rift in his ranks, including unconfirmed reports of a hush-hush meeting between three JJP MLAs and former CM Manohar Lal Khattar at minister Mahipal Dhanda's residence in Panipat. Dhanda denied any such meeting was held, but sources said the JJP trio of Devender Babli (Tohana), Ramniwas Surjakhera (Narwana) and Jogi Ram Sihag (Barwala) weren't the only ones creating room for BJP to manoeuvre itself out of a potentially tight spot. JJP had issued a show-cause to these three MLAs the previous day over alleged anti-party activities.Sihag and Surjakhera have been rooting for BJP's Lok Sabha candidates at rallies, while another four of JJP's 10 MLAs have indicated they might not fall in line despite Dushyant's threat to act against anyone defying the party's whip in the event of a floor test.INLD joined Congress in calling for President's rule if BJP fails to prove its majority in the House. The clamour for a floor test comes less than three months after BJP survived a no-confidence motion.Saini maintained there was no threat to his govt despite the coalition being reduced to a minority with 43 MLAs, 40 of them from BJP. Two independents - Nayan Pal Rawat and Rakesh Daultabad - and Gopal Kanda of Haryana Lokhit Party (HLP) are still backing the govt. On paper, the opposition camp has 30 MLAs from Congress, 10 of JJP, INLD's lone MLA and four Independents, including the three who bailed out two days ago.Two seats are vacant since ex-CM Manohar Lal Khattar and Independent MLA Ranjit Singh Chautala resigned last March.In its letter to the governor, Congress sought time for deputy leader of the opposition Aftab Ahmad and chief whip B Lok hit Batra to visit Raj Bhavan on Friday and submit a memorandum explaining why the govt needs to take a floor test.Dushyant said JJP was open to backing any other political party other than BJP in forming a new govt. ""It is evident that the incumbent no longer commands a majority in the legislative assembly,"" he wrote. The former deputy CM requested the governor to invoke his constitutional prerogative in accordance with Article 174 and direct the appropriate authority to immediately call for a floor test.INLD's Abhay Chautala said CM Saini had ""no legal and moral right to continue in office"" after his govt was reduced to a minority. Article 174 confers on the governor the authority to summon, prorogue, and dissolve the assembly.In a landmark case - S R Bommai vs Union of India - Supreme Court laid down the scope of a governor's discretion in determining whether a particular govt has a majority. The apex court said the governor had a constitutional obligation to act judiciously and impartially in such matters and was authorised to call for a floor test if and when needed. A no-confidence motion, distinct from a trust vote, cannot be moved against any govt within six months of the previous one.","Pressure mounts on Nayab Singh Saini govt in Haryana to take a floor test.

In 2010, he left many of his seniors in Congress amazed when he became the chief minister of undivided Andhra Pradesh and held the top position till the bifurcation of the state in June 2014.Kiran, who went into a self-imposed exile for 10 years after that, is now back in electoral action — this time as a BJP candidate from the Rajampet Lok Sabha constituency .This is his maiden attempt in parliamentary elections.Kiran, who happens to be one of the two “accidental” Congress chief ministers of undivided Andhra along with Konijeti Rosaiah in the aftermath of Dr YS Rajasekhar Reddy’s death in a helicopter crash in 2019, had floated Jai Samaikyandhra Party (JSP) in the run-up to the 2014 general elections. But he did not contest and JSP couldn’t win a single seat as the electoral battle narrowed down between TDP and YSRCP in the truncated state.After Congress got decimated following the formation of Telangana, several big leaders of the party went into a state of political oblivion. Kiran, a four-time MLA from the Vayalpad and Piler assembly constituencies, also stayed away from his home constituency, Piler, for nearly a decade.Though Kiran rejoined Congress in 2018, hoping that he would be given a key role, he was sidelined. He resigned from the grand old party in March last year and joined BJP within a month.Once into the saffron fold, Kiran slammed Congress for taking back-to-back “wrong decisions”. “If a mistake has been made, it should be acknowledged, and efforts should be made to correct it. But in the absence of such a system in Congress, coupled with the uni lateral decisions of the high command, the party is losing everywhere,” he said.He said his family had been with Congress for more than seven decades but there is no scope to continue the legacy anymore as the party “hasn’t learnt lessons from its mistakes and lost back-to-back elections in one state after the other.”Now in his second political innings, Kiran is pitted against his arch-rival and YSRCP minister Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy’s son, PV Midhun Reddy, who is a two-time MP from Rajampet. Kiran seems to have pinned hopes on the groundwork done by his younger sibling, Nallari Kishore Kumar Reddy, who is contesting from the Piler assembly constituency on a TDP ticket.As the Nallari-Peddireddy families are again pitted against each other in an epic battle for political supremacy, Kiran returned to Piler a few weeks ago and started his homework immediately after BJP named him as the party candidate. He held a series of closed-door meetings with local functionaries and his followers in all assembly constituencies falling under the Rajampet LS constituency limits over the last few weeks.In his attempt to woo voters, Kiran promised the formation of Madanapalle district and continuing the development work in Piler that came to a “standstill” after he stepped down from the CM’s post.With just four days before polls, Prime Minister Narendra Modi campaigned at Piler on Wednesday for Kiran.During his address, he said the countdown has begun to drive out the YSRCP “mafia” and bring in the “double engine” NDA govt in Andhra. Modi recalled the devastation caused by the 2021 Annamayya dam collapse, in which nearly 25 villages were washed away and many people lost their lives.“While providing potable drinking water to every household is NDA’s goal, the YSRCP govt hasn’t cooperated for the effective implementation of the Jal Jeevan mission in Andhra. This govt has also failed to complete the Polavaram and several other irrigation projects in Rayalaseema,” Modi alleged.The PM said people of the Rayalaseema region are still reeling under the impact of backwardness despite having access to unlimited mines and minerals, world-class pilgrimage centres like Tirupati, hard-working farming community and talented youngsters because they had “pledged support to such political parties, which never had a vision for development”.Modi’s rally at Piler has boosted the morale of TDP-Jana Sena-BJP cadres, who are going all out in this no-holds-barred poll battle between the Nallari-Peddireddy families.",Kiran Kumar Reddy is a four-time MLA from the Vayalpad and Piler assembly constituencies.

Pakistan SC suspends Peshawar HC order denying reserved seats to Imran-backed party,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-sc-suspends-peshawar-hc-order-denying-reserved-seats-to-imran-backed-party/articleshow/109898987.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s Supreme Court suspended on Monday a high court verdict that a political party aligned with candidates backed by incarcerated former prime minister Imran Khan was not eligible for reserved seats for women and minorities in the national and provincial legislatures.Since the Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) was barred by the top court from contesting the Feb 8 elections under its traditional electoral symbol of a cricket bat on technical grounds, the party had subsequently struck an alliance with another party, Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), in an attempt to secure reserved seats in parliament.Under Pakistan’s election rules, political parties are allotted reserved seats — (there are 60 for women and 10 for minorities in the National Assembly) — in proportion to the number of parliamentary seats they win in the election. This completes the NA’s total strength of 336 seats.In March, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had ruled that SIC was not eligible for reserved seats and decided to distribute the seats among other parliamentary parties, with the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) becoming major beneficiaries. The verdict was rejected by PTI as unconstitutional and the alliance had filed a plea against the electoral watchdog’s decision in the Peshawar HC, but it rejected the appeal.In response, SIC moved the Supreme Court last month urging it to allot the party the reserved seats in the national and provincial assemblies and set aside the Peshawar HC ruling.Accepting SIC’s appeal for a hearing, the apex court clarified that the Peshawar HC order upholding ECP’s decision was suspended to the extent of the remaining reserved seats distributed among other parties.After losing the extra reserved seats, PM Shehbaz Sharif’s coalition government had lost its two-thirds majority in the National Assembly.","Pakistan’s Supreme Court suspended on Monday a high court verdict that a political party was not eligible for reserved seats for women and minorities.
