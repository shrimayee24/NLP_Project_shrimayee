She defeated AAP nominee Prem Lata by two votes - 19 against 17.In the 35-member house, BJP has 16 councillors while AAP and Congress alliance is in a majority, with 13 and 6 councillors, respectively. With the vote of Chandigarh MP Manish Tewari of Congress, who is an ex-officio member of CMC, the combine's total count is 20.

"AAP lashes out after Election Commission staff, cops search Mann house over complaint",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/aap-lashes-out-after-election-commission-staff-cops-search-mann-house-over-complaint/articleshow/117762867.cms,"NEW DELHI: Probing a complaint on the cVIGIL mobile application about money being allegedly distributed from the official residence of Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann in the city, a team of election officials, along with police, reached Kapurthala House on Thursday evening. They were stopped by the security personnel and had to wait for 90 minutes before they were finally allowed to go in. The entire search operation was recorded on video.AAP functionaries protested vehemently with Mann accusing the Election Commission of ""defaming Punjabis at the behest of BJP"" and AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal alleging that opposition functionaries were being targeted while BJP netas were openly distributing cash and valuables without facing any action. BJP, on the other hand, claimed that poll officials and cops were stalled from entering to remove incriminating material.According to the poll officials, the team was responding to a complaint on cVIGIL, a platform where anyone can report violations of the model code of conduct.As per standard protocol, a flying squad team (FST) of New Delhi assembly constituency stationed nearby was assigned by the control room the task of investigating the complaint and closing it by taking appropriate action within the stipulated 100-minute timeframe,” the district election office of the New Delhi district said in a statement.In a post on X, Mann alleged that the Election Commission was not reacting to the complaints of “open distribution” of money but had conducted a raid at his house with police. “BJP members are openly distributing money, yet neither Delhi Police, nor the Election Commission seems to notice anything. No action is being taken against this…” Mann said in a post in Hindi.“I don’t understand. It’s BJP functionaries who are openly distributing money, blankets, saris, shoes, jackets, shawls, and even gold chains. Yet, the raid is happening on the chief minister of Punjab. What kind of governance is this? What did EC find during the raid? When will EC muster the courage to raid those BJP netas who are openly distributing money and goods?” Kejriwal said.While Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh charged BJP with launching a campaign to “defame Punjabis and Sikhs”, Delhi chief minister Atishi posted on X that “the people of Delhi will give their answer to BJP on the 5th (with their votes)!”AAP Punjab president and cabinet minister Aman Arora also lashed out at BJP. He wrote on X: “BJP is unable to accept the truth written on the wall about AAP's victory and their own defeat. The raid on the Delhi residence of the chief minister of Punjab, Bhagwant Mann, is next in the series of vendettas by BJP against Punjab and Punjabis, which neither the people of Punjab nor those of Delhi will tolerate.”Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva, however, claimed that by the time poll officials were allowed inside Kapurtha House, an “operation cleanup” had already taken place, and that’s why no illegal material was found. “By preventing election officials from entering Kapurthala House, Punjab Police protected Punjab’s leaders from investigation, which is both disgraceful and a blatant attack on democracy,” Sachdeva claimed.","A team of election officials, along with police, reached Kapurthala House on Thursday evening.

Election Commission keeps all options open as Arvind Kejriwal escalates water row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ec-keeps-all-options-open-as-arvind-kejriwal-escalates-water-row/articleshow/117762641.cms,"NEW DELHI: With former Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal sticking to his guns on “Haryana poisoned Yamuna waters” allegations and launching a scathing attack on the Election Commission , all options are open for the EC. This could include ordering a criminal FIR if it concludes that he has failed to back up his claims with facts and evidence by the Friday 11 am deadline set by the poll panel.The EC letter to Kejriwal on Thursday stated that his reply to its notice provided no “factual and legal matrix” with evidence to back his allegation that the BJP govt in Haryana deliberately poisoned the waters of Yamuna “with an intent to cause genocide of citizens of Delhi”. It put on record that the commission has prima facie found his allegations as “promoting disharmony and enmity between different groups, and overall public disorder and unrest, even by most sober interpretation”.EC said the words used in his statement, the comparative emphasis laid on them and the manner of expression at a delicate time during peak campaigning “prima facie pose a risk of endangering peace and harmony between states and peoples.”As Kejriwal refused to back off, his defiance raised the prospect of EC responding with measures, including the registration of an FIR, in its armoury for alleged violation of the model code of conduct.The AAP convenor responded by going ballistic against the poll panel and Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar and said, ""I want to tell Rajiv Kumarji, history will not forgive you. The amount of damage you have done to the EC, I don't think it has ever been tarnished this badly in India's history. I know that within two days, they will put me in jail. The kind of language the EC has used today is unprecedented. This is not the job of the EC.""He went on to say that if Kumar wanted to engage in politics, he should contest an election. ""Let him stand as a candidate from any assembly seat in Delhi,"" he said.The EC letter said Kejriwal, being a prominent public figure and former chief minister, should be aware of the dire consequences that such utterances can have and how they can leave permanent scars between residents of Haryana and Delhi. The poll panel also noted that in its notice on Tuesday, it had elaborated the legal and regulatory provisions attracted by his claims if not proved true.EC's assertions indicate that any dissatisfaction with Kejriwal's reply to its five pointed queries - the kind of poison mixed by Haryana in Yamuna; supporting evidence of the quantity, nature and manner of detecting the poison; locations where the poison was detected; which DJB engineers detected it and how and where; and the methodology employed by those engineers to stop the poisonous water from entering Delhi - may lead the poll panel to consider directing Delhi Police to file an FIR invoking Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita Section 196 (statements that promote enmity between groups), Section 197 (imputations prejudicial to national integration) and Section 353 (public mischief), as also Section 123(4) of the Representation of the People Act (false statement equivalent to a corrupt practice).All three BNS sections attract up to three years in prison, or fine, or both. Separately, EC may initiate action against Kejriwal for violating model code provisions that restrain parties and candidates from activities that create hatred and tension between groups.The poll panel on Thursday told Kejriwal that his reply was ""entirely silent"" on his public and widely circulated campaign statement of 'poisoning' of Yamuna waters. ""Instead of clarifying factual and legal matrix of your statement you have chosen to justify it under the question on high ammonia content in the river Yamuna in Delhi,"" EC said as it reminded Kejriwal that the commission was dealing separately with the matter already raised by the chief ministers of Delhi and Punjab. It said Haryana govt's inputs on the issue were also being considered. TOI had exclusively reported om Wedneday's EC's response to Kejriwal's reply to its notice.On Kejriwal's request for EC's intervention to ensure availability of sufficient and safe water, the commission said the matter was best left to the competence and discretion of the govts and the agencies concerned.","The poll panel on Thursday told Kejriwal that his reply was ""entirely silent"" on his public and widely circulated campaign statement of 'poisoning' of Yamuna waters.

AAP vs Cong gets bigger and bitter: Why has Rahul doubled down on attacks against Kejriwal?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/aap-vs-cong-gets-bigger-and-bitter-why-rahul-has-doubled-down-on-attacks-against-kejriwal/articleshow/117748063.cms,"NEW DELHI: The AAP versus Congress battle in Delhi is getting bigger and bitter with the allies-turned-rivals engaged in no-holds-barred attack against each other. Arvind Kejriwal and Rahul Gandhi , who have shared stage several times in the last one year as allies under the opposition's INDIA banner, have been targeting each other like never before.Rahul Gandhi has been relentless in his attacks on Kejriwal. The former Congress president has accused the AAP chief of ""speaking lies like PM Narendra Modi"" and claimed that ""probably Kejriwal is even more 'chalaak (cunning)' than Modi."" Rahul also attacked Kejriwal for allowing the ""biggest liquor scam"" to happen under his watch and has taken jibes at AAP chief's 'sheesh mahal wali rajneeti'.Kejriwal has also returned fire reminding Rahul Gandhi about the involvement of Gandhi family in the National Herald corruption case and has alleged Congress complicity with the BJP in ensuring clean chit to Robert Vadra in alleged land grab cases. The AAP chief has blamed the Congress of fighting Delhi elections to defeat his party and in the process help the BJP.""This time, there is 'ilu ilu' between the BJP and Congress, and they are fighting these elections together. Voting for Congress means voting for BJP. Do not press the wrong button, otherwise, life will be miserable,"" Kejriwal said at a rally with Samjawadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav by his side.The Congress has reacted sharply to allegations of ""tango with the BJP"" and has said that by similar yardsticks it could be claimed that AAP had joined hands with BJP in states where it contested against the grand-old-party. ""Arvind Kejriwal is rattled to see his impending defeat (in the elections). We can also ask him that when he went to Goa, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Gujarat, and Maharashtra, did he make a compromise with the BJP? Such statements don't suit Kejriwal,"" Congress leader Supriya Shrinate said countering AAP chief's charge.When Kejriwal tried to change the discourse of Delhi campaign by accusing Haryana government of poisoning the city's water - Rahul led the charge to shred the AAP chief and said, ""Kejriwal ji, now 2025 has come. When will you take a dip in the Yamuna? Delhi is waiting!""Ever since coming to power in Delhi, Kejriwal has been making empty promises - 'we will clean Yamuna, I will take a dip or else don't vote', and many more long speeches. And today again he is sitting with a bottle of Yamuna water making allegations and counter-allegations,"" Rahul said.""This is not just an insult to Yamuna ji, it is a mockery of the lives of the people of Delhi that has been going on for years. This horrific condition of Yamuna is the result of the confluence of negligence and corruption of the Modi and Kejriwal governments,"" the Congress leader added.It will be interesting to see the impact of this bitter slugfest between the AAP and the Congress on the future dynamics of the INDIA bloc. Akhilesh Yadav has openly backed Kejriwal in this fight and held a road show with the AAP chief. His appeal to voters not to waste their votes had a subtle message for the Congress. Mamata Banerjee and Sharad Pawar have also spoken in support of Kejriwal. However, they have not joined the campaign on ground. Uddhav Thackeray has announced to stay neutral and stay away from campaigning in Delhi elections. While the dynamics of INDIA bloc differs from state to state, there is perhaps one common thread that defines its politics - balancing power aspirations between the Congress and the regional parties.Kejriwal is not the first INDIA bloc leader with which the Congress has had bitter tussle. We have seen a similar bickering play out in West Bengal where Congress and the Left parties refused to join hands with Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress. Mamata then levelled similar allegations against the Congress of working to help the BJP in Bengal.Interestingly however, the intensity of Congress's attacks against Kejriwal is much more than what we saw in Bengal against Mamata. AAP is the only national party in the opposition alliance other than the Congress and has spread its wings in several states. This raises the obvious question - Does Congress see Kejriwal as a bigger threat to the grand-old-party than other regional leaders including Mamata or is the Congress trying to send out a message to other allies in the opposition bloc?While there may be no clear answer to this - the aggression in Rahul's attacks on Kejriwal perhaps points to the party's long-term plans as the Congress is unlikely to make big gains in these elections riding on this offensive.",Rahul Gandhi has been relentless in his attacks on Kejriwal. Akhilesh Yadav has openly backed Kejriwal in this fight. Mamata Banerjee and Sharad Pawar have also spoken in support of Kejriwal.

There, Uddhav’s PA and MLC Milind Narvekar asked Patil when the two would come together again. To this, Patil said, “I’m waiting for that golden moment.” Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut said that Patil’s feeling is shared by many in Sena (UBT).Raut said, “Chandrakant Patil has been a supporter of Shiv Sena-BJP alliance from the beginning. He is our good friend. Especially with regard to having Shiv Sena BJP alliance, there was an older generation, including leaders like Chandrakant Patil (who were favourably inclined). Now, there are many newbies in BJP. They will not understand the importance of the alliance of 25 years. They have no connection with BJP, they have no connection with the alliance. But the feelings of Chandrakant Patil are the same as the feelings of many in that party. Because we worked well with him for 25 years. We also worked well with Modi. But after the rise of Amit Shah in Delhi, disillusionment entered Shiv Sena-BJP alliance. We are grateful to Patil for raising positive issues regarding the Sena-BJP alliance.”He further stated, “Shiv Sena (UBT) netas may also have such feelings. We joined MVA because of the insistence of some people in BJP to break the alliance. If we look at the reasons for which the 25-year-old alliance broke up, our stance was right. What we were demanding was given to Eknath Shinde after our party split. Shah rejected our demand, he decided to break Shiv Sena. He wanted to break and destroy Balasaheb Thackeray’s Shiv Sena. Even today, Shinde is being used for that purpose.”",BJP minister Chandrakant Patil told Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday that he was waiting for the “golden moment’ when the two parties would ally again.
