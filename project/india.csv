"'When BJP-led regime is ousted, will bring amendment to nullify Waqf Bill': Mamata Banerjee",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/when-bjp-led-regime-is-ousted-will-bring-amendment-to-nullify-waqf-bill-mamata-banerjee/articleshow/119940951.cms,"West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee (File Image)

NEW DELHI: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday rejected the Waqf Amendment Bill , which was passed in the Lok Sabha with 288 votes in favour, and claimed that once the BJP-led regime was ousted, they would nullify the law.The controversial bill passed in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday after a marathon 12-hour debate, securing 288 votes in favor and 232 against. The BJP received support from its allies, including the TDP, JD(U), Shiv Sena, and LJP.In a presser, Mamata Banerjee said that BJP brought Waqf (Amendment) Bill to divide country.""When BJP-led regime is ousted and new govt formed, will bring amendment to nullify Waqf Bill,"" Banerjee said in a presser.Yesterday, Wednesday, also Banerjee slammed the Centre over the Waqf Amendment Bill and said that the jumla party’s (BJP) only agenda is to divide the country. Trinamool Congress chief claimed that the BJP believes in only divide and rule policy.""The jumla party’s only one point agenda is to divide the country. They only believe in divide & rule policy which we don’t. First learn to respect the Constitution and than takeaway someone's rights,"" Banerjee said in the presser.In the 12-hr long debate, the government countered the opposition's charges of encroachment on constitutional and Muslim rights and attacks on federalism with a strong defence of the changes in the Act governing Islamic endowments .After the Lok Sabha, the bill moved to Rajya Sabha and is expected to comfortably clear the numbers test in that as well. Although the debate in LS followed the by-now familiar 'secular versus communal' trajectory, the smooth passage of the bill marked an important juncture.","The controversial bill passed in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday after a marathon 12-hour debate, securing 288 votes in favor and 232 against.

Waqf bill seeks to complete unfinished tasks of previous governments: Kiren Rijiju,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/waqf-bill-seeks-to-complete-unfinished-tasks-of-previous-governments-kiren-rijiju/articleshow/119958464.cms,"NEW DELHI: Minority affairs minister Kiren Rijiju on Thursday refuted the opposition's charge of the govt bulldozing an ""anti-Muslim"" legislation, and said the new waqf law was aimed at better management of waqf properties and to accomplish ""unfulfilled tasks of previous govts"".When the bill was taken up in RS, some opposition MPs were wearing black as a mark of protest. INDIA bloc parties alleged that the bill was ""unconstitutional"" and aimed at targeting Muslims. Congress , TMC, DMK, AAP, Shiv Sena (UBT), Samajwadi Party, RJD and Left parties questioned the govt's intent behind bringing the legislation.Leader of the House and BJP president J P Nadda pointed out that other Muslim-dominated countries, including Turkiye, Malaysia, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and Iran had changed their laws for better management of waqf properties. ""When these Muslim nations are digitising waqf properties and making them accountable, then what is the problem if it is being done in India?"" he said, adding that with the amendments, the govt has tried to ensure that waqf properties are in the right hands and used for the benefit of Muslims.Nadda said Muslim women became second-grade citizens during UPA's term. ""It was only India where Muslim women were not brought into the mainstream,"" he said, adding that triple talaq was banned in Muslim countries such as Egypt, Sudan, Bangladesh and Syria several years ago. ""We believe in real service, not lip service. Today crores of Muslim sisters have the right to live with dignity. Who did it? It is a historic decision and none other than PM Modi has done it,"" Nadda said.Nominated BJP MP Ghulam Ali supported the bill and said there was an urgent need for this legislation as a certain family was usurping Muslims' land. He called for a CBI inquiry into the misuse of waqf board and waqf properties.Leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge accused the govt of trying to sow the seeds of conflict by suppressing Muslims through the legislation and appealed to BJP not to disturb peace and harmony in the country. ""This is against Muslims, not constitutional, and don't try to stoke disturbances in the peaceful fabric of society,"" he said.Rijiju countered the allegations and said, ""Many people said this is unconstitutional, illegal and the right of Muslims is being snatched away. Very categorically, I want to reject all these allegations.""""Whatever you could not fulfil, the Narendra Modi govt has shown the courage to pursue,"" he said referring to Congress and its allies. He accused the Congress of ""appeasement politics"" and said that in 2013, the UPA govt had brought amendments to the 1995 Waqf Act ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha polls in a rush to appeal to the sentiments of the minority vote bank.Rijiju said 31,999 cases were pending in the waqf tribunal and more than 14,000 litigants were Muslims, adding that a provision has been created to enable a person to challenge the tribunal's decision through civil suits in high courts.","Opposition parties alleged that the bill was ""unconstitutional"" and aimed at targeting Muslims.

She said transferring the affected staff would have been a more just solution.""I have a question here. If the only consequence after crores are recovered from a judge's house is a transfer, they could have just transferred these 25,000 brothers and sisters as well,"" she said, referring to a recent controversy.""We have no complaint against any judge. But, as a citizen, I have every right to say - with respect to the judiciary - that I cannot accept the judgment,"" Banerjee said. ""We cannot criticise a judge, but we can express our views on humanitarian grounds.""She accused BJP and CPM of trying to destabilise Bengal's education system and questioned why other recruitment scandals, such as MP's Vyapam scam, had not faced similar consequences. ""Over 11,000 of these teachers were teaching students of classes IX and X and 5,596 of them were teaching classes XI and XII... Many have been checking Madhyamik and higher secondary answer scripts,"" Banerjee said. ""Who will now teach these kids? Is BJP-CPM trying to trigger a collapse of the state's education system?""SC upheld an earlier Calcutta HC order cancelling the appointments made by state's School Service Commission between 2016 and 2021, citing irregularities in the hiring process. The ""bribe-for-jobs"" controversy had led to the 2022 arrest of former state education minister Partha Chatterjee , who was charged by ED with money laundering. Authorities seized more than Rs 49 crore in cash from two flats of Chatterjee's aide, actor-producer Arpita Mukherjee.""The former education minister has been in jail for years. How many times must there be punishment for same crime? How many people will be punished for a single person's crime?"" Banerjee said.She also took aim at former Calcutta HC judge Abhijit Gangopadhyay, who had ruled against the recruitment process in 2022 before resigning to join BJP and winning the Tamluk seat. ""Calcutta HC verdict was first given by (someone who is now) a BJP MP. It is some Ganguly, Danguly, I do not know his name,"" she said.The CM announced plans to meet affected teachers to explore legal options. She sought to reassure them, urging patience & vowing state support.Banerjee said Bengal would implement SC's ruling and complete fresh recruitment within three months, as directed.
