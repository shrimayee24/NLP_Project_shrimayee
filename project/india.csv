"CEOs of Maharashtra, Haryana issue fresh letter to Rahul Gandhi, give him 10 days to prove 'voter fraud' claims",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ceos-of-maharashtra-haryana-issue-fresh-letter-to-rahul-gandhi-give-him-10-days-to-prove-voter-fraud-claims/articleshow/123228040.cms,"NEW DELHI: The chief electoral officers of Maharashtra and Haryana on Sunday sent fresh letters to Leader of the Opposition Rahul Gandhi, giving him 10 days to furnish a signed declaration with particulars of electors he alleged were fraudulently added, so that necessary proceedings may be initiated.Karnataka CEO too sent a notice to Rahul on Sunday, citing Mahadevapura voter Shakun Rani’s denial of his claim at a recent press conference that she had voted twice from Mahadevapura AC in 2024 Lok Sabha polls. The Congress leader was requested him to provide the documents based on which he had reached the conclusion, so that a detailed inquiry could be held.“On inquiry, Smt Shakun Rani (the voter in question) had stated that she has voted only once and not twice, as alleged by you. Preliminary inquiry conducted by this office also reveals that the tick-marked document shown by you in the presentation is not a document issued by the polling officer,"" the CEO said in a letter sent to the Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha.The Election Commission, in wake of the Karnataka CEO’s latest letter to Rahul, once again asked him to submit a timely response. “He should either file the declaration/oath under Rules 20(3)b of the Registration of Electors Act 1960 or apologise to the nation for making baseless allegation against EC,” said an EC functionary.Sources said if Rahul does not furnish a declaration, his claims cannot be investigated since the law requires evidence by any person (who is not a voter in that particular constituency himself) to be tendered on oath.If Rahul were to furnish an oath and the evidence and it is found to be fabricated or false, Section 227 and 229 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) (giving false evidence) shall kick in; the section provides for jail term up to three years and, if this false evidence is repeated in court, it invites jail up to seven years. Also, making false allegations in connection with preparation, revision or correction of electoral roll or inclusion/exclusion of any entry in electoral roll, is punishable with imprisonment up to one year under Section 31 of the Representation of the People Act, 1950.Meanwhile, EC sources on Sunday told TOI that the alleged polling records shown by Rahul as “EC data” with 'tick marks' against Shakun Rani's name, appear fabricated, as such records form part of Form 17A maintained and retained by the polling officer. Access to Form 17A is limited to authorised EC officials and these are not shared with the political parties. The parties' polling agents do get polling records but in Form 17C, which do not contain the voters' photographs. Form 17A is only produced before the court when sought in any judicial proceeding.Flashing a ""forged document"" at a press conference could spell legal consequences for Rahul as he may face an FIR for violation of Section 337 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) 2023, which provides for jail term up to seven years for forging a govt-issued ID like voter identity card or a register maintained by a public servant. Also being in possession of such forged documents is a criminal offence under Section 339 of BNS, also punishable with imprisonment that can extend to seven years.EC sources said the Karnataka CEO is yet to receive any documents cited by Rahul at last week's press conference to allege 'massive voter fraud' in the state's Mahadevapura AC.Rahul Gandhi had, in his presentation at the press conference, displayed Shakun Rani's voter details in the electoral roll ""obtained through RTI from EC ERO login"" and the ""BLA-marked electoral roll"", and claimed in his remarks that the polling officer had ticked against her ID card twice, recording her duplicate votes. Interestingly, the role of a political party's booth level agent (BLA) is limited to activities concerning the electoral roll; it's the polling agents who represent the party and their candidates in the polling station are their polling agents.","Karnataka CEO too sent a notice to Rahul on Sunday, citing Mahadevapura voter Shakun Rani’s denial of his claim at a recent press conference that she had voted twice.

Rahul Gandhi’s 10 Major Allegations Against EC, Presents 'Evidence' Of 'Massive Vote Theft’

NEW DELHI: Echoing Sharad Pawar ’s “160 seats” claim, Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut on Sunday alleged the same two unnamed individuals the NCP (SP) supremo mentioned, had also approached Uddhav Thackeray twice — first during the 2024 Lok Sabha polls and later ahead of the Maharashtra assembly elections.""Sharad Pawar said some people met him before the (Maharashtra) polls. The same set of people also met (Sena (UBT) chief) Uddhav Thackeray during the Lok Sabha (polls).

They asked us to assign 60-65 difficult seats and promised victory through EVMs. However, Thackeray refused, saying we don't feel the need to do it.""He further recalled being ""warned"" by the persons that ""those in power"" (BJP-led Mahayuti) had prepared a ""plan"" through EVMs and electoral rolls to win.The BJP won 132 seats in the assembly elections with allies Shiv Sena and NCP adding 57 and 41 constituencies, respectively, to the Mahayuti tally.On the other hand, the MVA won only 46 seats (Shiv Sena (UBT) 20, Congress 16, and NCP (SP) 10).Pawar on Saturday caused a flutter in political circles with his remarks.

Whose white tiger is it? Turf war over shifting safari in MP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/whose-white-tiger-is-it-turf-war-over-shifting-safari-in-mp/articleshow/123225053.cms,"BHOPAL: Claws are out in a grey-area tussle over a white tiger safari in Madhya Pradesh. Who keeps the legacy of Mohan, a big cat captured as a cub in 1951 by then maharaja of Rewa that went on to become the progenitor of nearly all white tigers in captivity in the world? This question has turned a seemingly routine govt redrawing of district maps in MP into a massive turf war.After a letter from Maihar district administration on Aug 7 suggested that Mukundpur - home to the world's only White Tiger Safari - should be moved to neighbouring Rewa, politicians and common people of both districts are at loggerheads. While those in Rewa say it is a ""homecoming"", people in Maihar are up in arms against this move, heating up politics in the Vindhya region.The letter proposes shifting Mukundpur and five neighbouring panchayats - Anandgarh, Amin, Dhobahat, Parsiya and Papra - from Maihar to Rewa district, citing recommendations from the state's Administrative Boundaries Reorganisation Commission. On paper, it's a matter of redrawing maps. On the ground, it's a tug-of-war over history, tourism revenue and political prestige.For Rewa, the safari is more than just an attraction - it's a birthright. Mohan's stuffed remains still guard the Rewa palace museum, his story etched into the region's identity.Bringing the safari into Rewa's official borders, supporters argue, would ""bring Mohan home"".But in Maihar's Amarpatan belt, the move has landed like a hostile takeover.Satna MP Ganesh Singh has called it ""a calculated conspiracy"", while BJP veteran and former minister Ramkhilawan Patel vowed that the villages ""will remain in Maihar"". Congress heavyweight and former Speaker Rajendra Kumar Singh has gone further, accusing deputy CM Rajendra Shukla of engineering the shift to ""grab the White Tiger Safari"" and calling for a Gandhian-style satyagraha, even suggesting ""filling Maihar jail"" in protest.Opponents allege the timing was no accident: the letter was issued a day after the assembly session was abruptly ended, they claim, to prevent debate by the local MLA. Singh has warned villagers to expect ""pressure"" from officials to sign off on the transfer, urging them to resist ""local Mir Jafars and Jaichands"".The stakes are high - not only does the safari draw tourists from across the country, but its brand value is unmatched in Madhya Pradesh's wildlife tourism. For now, the map hasn't changed. But in the Vindhya heartland, the battle over Mukundpur is fast becoming as much about political dominance as it is about a legendary tiger's legacy.","Mukundpur, home to the world's only White Tiger Safari, should be moved to neighbouring Rewa district.

BENGALURU: Fresh cracks have emerged within governing Congress in Karnataka as senior functionaries have openly expressed dissent over former party MP and former Congress president Rahul Gandhi 's recent claims of ""vote theft"" during the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.Cooperation minister KN Rajanna — a known supporter of chief minister Siddaramaiah — has again stirred controversy with remarks that have drawn a sharp response from deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar's supporters.In response to a rally led by Rahul, Lok Sabha opposition leader, in Bengaluru last week, where he accused the Election Commission of India (ECI) of bias and blamed discrepancies in voter lists for the party's defeat in key constituencies like Bangalore Central, Rajanna pushed back by suggesting that the party must also take responsibility.""One should remember that voter lists were revised when our own govt was at the helm,"" Rajanna told reporters. ""Why did our party turn a blind eye then? It is true that there are irregularities, but it is insulting for us that it happened right under our nose.""Reminding party colleagues that the ECI had invited objections after publishing draft electoral rolls, Rajanna said: ""It becomes our responsibility to act in timely fashion on issues like electoral rolls.We should have raised objections then, especially in the case of Mahadevapura where there are many instances of malpractice. After keeping silent when we were supposed to talk, we are talking about it now.""As expected, his comments have not gone down well with members of Shivakumar's camp, who accused Rajanna and other seniors of acting against party interests. The internal tensions come amid a larger ongoing struggle for the CM post between supporters of Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar.Adding to Congress' concerns, food and civil supplies minister KH Muniyappa, speaking in a party forum, urged the state leadership to strengthen its grassroots presence ahead of upcoming zilla and taluk panchayat elections. He emphasised BJP's growing influence, saying Congress has failed to ""control BJP.""Shivakumar loyalists accused Rajanna and others of attempting to destabilise the party and said they will escalate the matter to the party high command.""The state govt has decided to investigate the issue of vote theft and it has asked the Advocate General to submit a report,"" said HD Ranganath, Kunigal MLA. ""Talking negatively against our own party and govt even before the investigation is over is unpardonable. The high command must take serious note of it end such anti-party activities.""Meanwhile, former Mahadevapura MLA Aravind Limbavali of BJP, seized the moment to bolster the opposition's narrative.""Rahul should open his eyes at least now, as his own party members are reiterating what we have said. I will soon make a powerpoint presentation on this in New Delhi,"" Limbavali said.While addressing the issue of voter list discrepancies on Friday, he avoided mentioning Shivakumar's Kanakapura constituency but pointed fingers at Siddaramaiah's Varuna seat and other constituencies held by his loyalists — including Chamarajpet (BZ Zameer Ahmed Khan), Gandhinagar (Dinesh Gundu Rao), Sandur (E Annapoorna), and BTM Layout (Ramalinga Reddy).","Fresh cracks have emerged within governing Congress in Karnataka.
