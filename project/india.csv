"Prashant Kishor questions 'physical and mental' health of Nitish Kumar, says BJP will suffer for imposing him on Bihar",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/prashant-kishor-questions-physical-and-mental-health-of-nitish-kumar-says-bjp-will-suffer-for-imposing-him-on-bihar/articleshow/113853740.cms,"Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar and Prashant Kishor (R)

'Bihar is ready for change'

NEW DELHI: Prashant Kishor , who is all set to launch his political party in Bihar, on Tuesday claimed that state chief minister Nitish Kumar was not ""physically and mentally"" fit and accused the BJP of propping him up to run its government at the Centre. The political strategist-turned-politician, in an interview to news agency PTI, said his assessment of Nitish Kumar's health is based on the chief minister's relative absence from public life and his silence on host of burning issues - be it floods or the row over land survey and installation of smart meter.""A big section in Bihar is wondering if Nitish Kumar is mentally and physically fit to provide leadership to Bihar,"" Kishor said when asked to explain his contention that Bihar's longest-serving chief minister is not in a physically and mentally fit condition.Kishor claimed that everyone knows that Nitish Kumar is in last phase of his politics and that polls cannot be won in his name. ""Even his supporters know that in his current physical, mental and political state, he is in no way in a condition to run a state like Bihar,"" he said. ""People of Bihar had given a similar message in the 2020 elections when the JD(U) could win only 42 seats, falling way behind the BJP's 74 and the main opposition party RJD's 75,"" he added. Kishor had earlier alleged that Nitish Kumar had handed over the entire administration to 2-4 of his advisers and there was ""jungle raaj"" of officers in the state.Ironically, at one time Prashant Kihsor had helped Nitish Kumar led Mahagathbandhan win the 2015 Bihar assembly election. Kishor had later joined the Janata Dal (United) in September 2018 as vice-president of the party. However, this bonhomie was short lived.Prashant Kishor, whose Jan Suraaj campaign is taking the shape of a new party, alleged that the BJP has made Bihar suffer for its political compulsions and benefits and the people of the state will punish the saffron party for this.Also Read:""It is the BJP's compulsion that it has to retain Nitish Kumar in power in Bihar for running its government in Delhi, Kishor said and added ""The BJP knows that its alliance will lose if he remains at the helm, but to keep him is the political compulsion of the party.""""Results will reflect it. The BJP will be punished for its doings. The Congress helped Lalu Prasad run a 'jungle raaj' for 15 years. People of Bihar completely uprooted the Congress. The BJP will suffer the same fate,"" Kishor said.Taking a swipe at the BJP, he said that the saffron party breaks up other parties across the country by hook or by crook but has chosen to ""impose"" Kumar on Bihar despite having many more seats in the assembly due to its need for JD(U) MPs.Prashant Kishor, who has toured the state for almost two years, is confident that people will give his party an absolute majority in the 243-member assembly when elections are held next year.Read also:""People voted for either of the two main alliances in Bihar due to a lack of alternative. They will shake off the two rival alliances, which have kept the state most poor and backward for over 30 years,"" Kishor said.""People will rise above caste, religion and mandir-masjid issue to vote solely for the future of their children's education and employment, and Jan Suraaj will be that instrument of change,"" he claimed.Asked if he will contest the election or be the chief ministerial face of the party, Kishor said it is for its leaders to decide.(With inputs from agencies)","Prashant Kishor claims Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar is not ""physically and mentally"" fit.

'Hunger strike'

What is the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution?

NEW DELHI: Ladakh-based climate activist and education reformer Sonam Wangchuk , along with over 170 others, began an indefinite hunger strike after being detained by Delhi Police at the Singhu border on Monday night.They were on their way to the national capital for the ""Delhi Chalo"" Padyatra , demanding sixth schedule status for the UT(Union territory).They were detained for allegedly “violating prohibitory orders” and are currently housed in police stations across Bawana, Narela and Kanjhawala.One of the detainees at Arya Samaj Ashram in Narela, where 23 women and seven men have been lodged, said they are on a peaceful march and yet they are being held like criminals.Wangchuk began a 21-day hunger strike, referred to as a “climate fast,” on March 6.He claims that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has promised twice to include Ladakh under the Sixth Schedule.In its 2019 Lok Sabha election manifesto, the BJP listed this as one of its top three priorities, and they made the same promise before the 2020 elections for the Hill Development Council in Ladakh, which they won.Wangchuk insists that the BJP's commitment to the Sixth Schedule was a key election promise and the government should honor it.The Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution is designed to safeguard tribal communities and their interests through autonomous governance.It establishes autonomous institutions with legislative, judicial, and executive powers to manage local governance.","Ladakh-based climate activist Sonam Wangchuk began an indefinite hunger strike after being detained by Delhi Police at the Singhu border on Monday night.
