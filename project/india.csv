"Can EC be powerless to disqualify a foreigner getting elected, asks SC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/can-ec-be-powerless-to-disqualify-a-foreigner-getting-elected-asks-sc/articleshow/115910823.cms,"Supreme Court of India

NEW DELHI: Is the Election Commission powerless to disqualify a foreign national, who has got elected as a gram panchayat Mukhiya, despite unimpeachable evidence about his nationality?This question of law was raised by Bihar state election commission before the SC on Monday. A Nepalese citizen had written to the Nepal govt to cancel his citizenship. But prior to its cancellation, he contested and won the 'Mukhiya' election in a Bihar gram panchayat. Patna HC overturned the SEC's decision to disqualify him saying it was the Union govt which alone can decide citizenship and nationality of a person.The SEC challenged the HC order before the SC and a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Justice Ujjal Bhuyan impleaded Union of India as a party and sought its response by Dec 9. The HC had ruled that SEC did not have the power to decide the disqualification of a candidate either before or after the elections, excluding an election dispute.As per the SEC appeal, one Biltu Ray aka Bilat Ray aka Bilat Prasad Yadav was a citizen of Nepal in 2006-07 and held a valid Indian passport from Oct 25, 1996, till Oct 24, 2006. He never applied for renewal of the passport after its expiry. In March 2016, he filed an application with Nepalese authorities seeking to relinquish his Nepalese citizenship.In Oct 2021, he filed his nomination for the post of Mukhiya of Bhaluaha gram panchayat without disclosing that he is a citizen of Nepal. In Dec 2021, he was elected as Mukhiya.","Nepalese citizen had written to the Nepal govt to cancel his citizenship.

"Can an EVM record 1,500 votes in a booth, apex court asks EC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/can-an-evm-record-1500-votes-in-a-booth-sc-asks-ec/articleshow/115910728.cms,"NEW DELHI: Electronic voting machines, despite repeated clean chits, continue to face scrutiny. Supreme Court on Monday sought Election Commission 's response to a PIL which apprehended that many would be denied voting rights as ""an EVM can register a maximum of 660 votes per day"" even though the number of voters per booth has increased from 1,000 to 1,500.The petitioner had arrived at the '660' number based on his calculation that a voter would take at least a minute to cast her ballot and voting was typically held for 11 hours on the scheduled day.A bench of Chief Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar asked senior advocate Maninder Singh, who appeared for EC, to file an affidavit explaining how the commission viewed the issues raised by petitioner Indu Prakash Singh. It posted the matter for further hearing on Jan 27.Maninder Singh said before conducting an election, EC consults every political party and polls have been conducted smoothly without a single voter complaining that she was not able to vote. He said the efficiency of EVMs have been repeatedly questioned before the SC, which each time, after a detailed verification, has approved the machines. But the bench said, ""There is some confusion because of your 2019 circular increasing the voters per booth from 1,000 to 1,500.""The petitioner said voting took place on the scheduled day for 11 hours and claimed that even if ""the election officials inside a booth are super efficient"", a voter would still take one minute to get his/her identity checked, mark name in the electoral roll, apply indelible ink on finger, cast vote and verify VVPAT.Thus, a total of 660 voters can cast their vote in the 11-hour scheduled voting time, he said. The petition said the cap on voters per booth was revised upwards from 1,000 to 1,500. ""As of the 2019 general elections, the average number of electors per polling station was recorded at 877, a decrease from 898 in 2014. Given this data, it is essential to reconsider and lower the upper limit of 1,500 electors per polling booth back to 1,000,"" the petitioner said.""By increasing this limit, the EC has compromised the operational efficiency of polling stations, potentially leading to longer waiting times, overcrowding, and voter fatigue,"" he added.When only 660 electors can cast their vote in an EVM within the scheduled 11-hour period, fixing 1,500 voters per booth would result in many people not being able to cast their vote, leading to disenfranchisement, he claimed.","Supreme Court seeks Election Commission's response to a PIL.

I could also connect to the V-P's office instantly,"" she writes.When she ""rang up Sonia Gandhi, Congress party president and my leader, one of her staff first said, 'Madam is busy.'
