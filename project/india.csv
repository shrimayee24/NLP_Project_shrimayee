Ankita Bhandari murder case: Sex rackets and drug abuse rampant at illegal resorts in Rishikesh, locals seek action

Told kin we'd follow their suggestion: Dhami

DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand CM Pushkar Singh Dhami recommended Friday a CBI inquiry into the ""mystery VIP"" connected with the 2022 murder of a 19-year-old receptionist at a Rishikesh resort owned by a BJP functionary's son, reports Kautilya Singh.The decision came following days of protests by several civic groups and opposition Congress on the issue, as well as two days after the chief minister met the victim's parents, who had handed him a letter seeking a CBI probe under the supervision of a Supreme Court judge. In the letter, the girl's father said his daughter was murdered because of a ""VIP"" whose identity remains unknown.A day later, the parents had reiterated their demand, adding they ""won't rest"" till they ""find out about the VIP"".Announcing the decision, CM Pushkar Singh Dhami said, ""From the very beginning, our aim has been to ensure justice in a fair, transparent and sensitive manner, and that commitment will continue. We had assured the victim's parents that the line of probe they suggested would be followed.""Last month, audio and video clips allegedly released by Haridwar-based actor Urmila Sanawar circulated in which former BJP MLA Suresh Rathore can purportedly be heard telling her about a ""VIP"", who he alleged was BJP national general secretary Dushyant Gautam.State Congress chief Ganesh Godiyal said, ""By recommending a CBI probe, govt has accepted there were faults in the initial probe. This is a win for the people and Congress. We demand that the investigation be carried out under the supervision of a Supreme Court or high court judge.""State BJP chief Mahendra Bhatt welcomed the decision, calling it in line with public sentiment and saying it would ""expose the opposition's lies"".",Uttarakhand CM Pushkar Singh Dhami recommended Friday a CBI inquiry into the 2022 murder of a 19-year-old receptionist at a Rishikesh resort.

Mamata Banerjee Hits Streets, Leads Kolkata Rally Against ED Raids

'I cannot hear anything': Judge said, leading to adjournment

KOLKATA: Aftershocks of the showdown between Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee over raids on Trinamool-linked political consultancy I-PAC jolted Calcutta high court Friday, prompting Justice Suvra Ghosh to postpone hearing petitions filed by either side till Jan 14 on grounds of ""enormous disturbance and commotion"" in the courtroom.The judge, seemingly annoyed at her repeated pleas for ""order"" being ignored by lawyers and apprentices seeking to outshout each other, walked out of the courtroom after quickly announcing the forced adjournment.Justice Ghosh specified in her order that she would have heard both petitions as scheduled had a large gathering of lawyers and others not entered the courtroom and caused a ruckus. ""Several requests made by the court to maintain decorum and dignity fell on deaf ears. The environment in the courtroom is not conducive to commence/continue with the hearing,"" she said.Enforcement Directorate, the first mover in the legal battle over Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee's alleged interference in the probe against I-PAC, immediately approached acting Chief Justice Sujoy Paul for an urgent hearing. The plea was turned down. Acting CJ Paul told the agency's counsel Dhiraj Trivedi that there was no justification in pushing for an urgent hearing after the judge assigned to take up its petition had fixed a date.The face-off between ED and Mamata started Thursday afternoon after she drove to the Loudon Street residence of I-PAC director Pratik Jain when the agency was searching the premises for evidence linked to an investigation in a 2020 money laundering case. The CM next went to I-PAC's office in Salt Lake's Sector V, staying put for almost four hours and allegedly taking away sheaves of documents and storage devices that she claimed contained TMC's election strategy.Besides Mamata, ED's petition accuses DGP Rajeev Kumar and Kolkata Police commissioner Manoj Varma of ""theft of digital devices and other evidence, and wrongful restraint and confinement of central govt officers"". Mamata's petition against ED alleges that the central agency was doing BJP's bidding and targeting I-PAC addresses to ""snatch"" Trinamool-specific and other data pertaining to the upcoming assembly elections.Friday's hearing was scheduled for 2.30pm, but the crowd in court no. 5 started to swell after the lunch break ended at 2pm. ED counsel Trivedi and Trinamool's Kalyan Banerjee complained that they were finding it impossible to reach the bench to argue their cases. ""Anyone not associated with the case, please leave,"" Justice Ghosh pleaded.After 15 minutes of chaos, HC officials and a Kolkata Police officer posted outside the courtroom managed to clear a section of the crowd, but the commotion refused to die down.

BJP Targets Mamata Banerjee Over ED Raid At I-PAC, Alleges Evidence Tampering

KOLKATA: TMC alleged on Friday ED was targeting I-PAC's current chief Pratik Jain, not its founder Prashant Kishor , in its coal scam-linked probe and that the move was linked to the latter's role in ""helping BJP"" in Nov 2025 Bihar elections ""This ED complaint dates back to 2020. Who was at the helm of I-PAC then? It was Prashant Kishor. Then why is Pratik Jain being targeted by ED and not Kishor? The answer is simple. Jain is now helping TMC with its party strategy. And Kishor, with his Jan Suraaj party in Bihar, divided opposition votes, which helped BJP,"" Trinamool spokesperson Arup Chakraborty said.Chakraborty claimed ED's raids on I-PAC betrayed its real motives. ""ED's complaint refers to events that took place in Goa, when Kishor was leading I-PAC. The cat is now out of the bag. ED's real target was TMC's candidate list, strategy documents and SIR-related data,"" Chakraborty said.While TMC's unease with Kishor was evident in 2021 after the party came to office for a third time, the party has never publicly spoken against him. Kishor parted ways with I-PAC to float Jan Suraaj in 2024.Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee referred to Kishor on Friday fleetingly during her protest march against ED's raids. ""When Narendra Modi became PM in 2014, I-PAC worked for him. Back then, Kishor was there. Now he is not there. Pratik oversees it,"" the CM said.","TMC claims ED is targeting I-PAC's current chief Pratik Jain, not its founder Prashant Kishor.
