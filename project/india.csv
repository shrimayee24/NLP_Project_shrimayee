Trinamool Congress looks to maintain dream run in its Kolkata South bastion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trinamool-congress-looks-to-maintain-dream-run-in-its-kolkata-south-bastion/articleshow/110547828.cms,"KOLKATA: If one were to identify one seat out of the 42 in West Bengal as a bastion of Trinamool Congress , it would undoubtedly be Kolkata South that Mamata Banerjee and then her party colleagues (after she stepped down in 2011 and contested as an MLA to become CM) have held for 33 years.Kolkata South also stands out for its distinct political landscape where out of the seven assembly segments, winners in five were state cabinet members until July 2022 when one of them — Partha Chatterjee who won from Behala West — was arrested for his alleged involvement in a teaching job scam.First as a Youth Congress functionary and then as Trinamool Congress founder, Mamata had won the seat for six consecutive terms from 1991 before passing on the baton to Subrata Bakshi who won in 2011 (byelection) and then in 2014. Mala Roy, who won in 2019 is defending the seat this time. What tilts the scales further in TMC’s favour is the significant 28% Muslim voters in the constituency who are expected to stay loyal to the party.“With due respect to my opposition candidates, I’m 200% confident of winning,” said Roy. “Not just because of our solid presence and base in this constituency but also because of my own track record here. My work speaks for itself. After Sougata Roy, I have asked the most questions in Parlia ment among Bengal MPs. Opposition parties are trying to malign us. They are even using multiple agencies to harass our functionaries. But the more they do so, the worse they will fare in this elections,” said Roy, who is also a local councillor and chairperson of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation.In 2019, Roy had trounced her nearest competitor, BJP ’s Chandra Kumar Bose, by more than 1.6 lakh votes. The latter, grandnephew of Subhas Chandra Bose, is no longer in the party.Roy has a star-studded support team in the constituency. CM Banerjee is herself the Bhowanipore MLA. Urban development minister and Kolkata mayor Firhad Hakim represents Kolkata Port. Javed Ahmed Khan from Kasba is the disaster management minister and Babul Supriyo from Ballygunge is the head of non-conventional and renewable energy sources ministry. Then there is Debasis Kumar from Rasbehari who is the KMC’s mayoral council member (parks and square). Ratna Chatterjee from Behala Purba, the estranged wife of former mayor Sovan Chatterjee, is another influential functionary.With such heavyweight presence alongside many minority voters in the 18.5 lakh-strong electorate, political observers and analysts believe it is a nocontest in three assembly segments: Kolkata Port, Ballygunge and Kasba. And that, they believe, is enough to win the Kolkata South seat yet again.BJP has fielded Debasree Chaudhuri, the outgoing Lok Sabha member from Raiganj Parliamentary constituency in North Dinajpur district, against Roy. While many termed Chaudhuri’s ejection from her stronghold Raiganj to the comparatively lesser-known turf of Kolkata South as more of an exile, the former Union junior minister for woman and child development views it as an opportunity to prove her worth in Trinamool’s strongest seat.“It’s a TMC stronghold alright but one that is built on lies and corruption and my job is to breach the fortress. That is the reason why the party brass has chosen me to contest from this seat. Among the five ministers in this constituency, one is in jail, and some are on bail. It tells you a lot about the party,” said Chaudhuri.Though BJP has never won the seat, the first MP to be elected in 1952 from the constituency — then known as Calcutta South-East — was Syama Prasad Mookerjee, founder of BJP’s predecessor Bharatiya Jana Sangh.Also in the fray is CPM’s Saira Shah Halim, the daughter-in-law of Bengal’s longest-serving speaker Hashim Abdul Halim and niece of actor Naseeruddin Shah and daughter of former deputy chief of Army staff, Lt Gen Zameer Uddin Shah.A relative newcomer to politics, Saira has been praised for her role in rejuvenating the CPM’s prospects in the closely contested Ballygunge assembly bypoll in 2022. She surprised many by finishing second ahead of BJP’s Keya Ghosh. Although Saira lost to Trinamool’s Babul Supriyo by 20,000 votes, her performance resulted in a significant 24% increase in her party’s vote share.However, Kolkata South is a different ballgame. The Left has won the seat only three times in the past: 1967, 1980 and 1989. But Saira says she is not daunted by the task at hand.“BJP is tinkering with the Constitution and Trinamool is full of corruption. People here are fed up with them and need an honest representative. People have seen how red volunteers have worked during Covid and showered their faith upon me in the 2022 bypoll. This cosmopolitan constituency needs a progressive and educative face and there is none better than me,” said the writer, activist and educator who was a business development and communications trainer with the West Bengal Electronics Industry Development Corporation Ltd before she took the political plunge.","Mala Roy, who won in 2019 is defending the seat this time. Out of the seven assembly segments, winners in five were state cabinet members.

Poll Issues

Vote For Development

Modi & Yogi Factor

GORAKHPUR: Old-timers recall that after the construction of Vikas Bhawan in the late 80s, there was no development work worth its name that had reached Gorakhpur for over three decades. However, the elevation of its five-time MP Yogi Adityanath to the post of UP’s chief minister saw a turnaround. Now, the city is known for a new AIIMS , fertilizer plant, Ramgarh Taal and a zoological garden.Once infamous for mafia and mosquitoes, Gorakhpur has projects of Rs 40,000 crore in various stages of completion.In the late ’90s, the district had earned the sobriquet of ‘Chicago of the East’ due to the battle for supremacy between dons like Hari Shankar Tiwari and Virendra Pratap Shahi. The district also witnessed the sudden rise of gangsters like Sriprakash Shukla and other criminals.During the last decade, especially in the last seven years of Yogi govt, a massive dip in crime rate has been reported and the district underwent a transformation with a host of development projects .Moreover, Gorakhpur, which used to be the epicentre of encephalitis which claimed the lives of hundreds of children every year, got rid of the epidemic with the help of a targeted strategy by the Yogi govt. “As an MP, he had relentlessly campaigned for the eradication of this disease, but his efforts didn’t bring desired results due to ‘unfriendly’ govts at Centre and in the state,” says S K Tripathi, a teacher.Residents say new roads, uninterrupted power supply and end of mosquito menace through fogging are like a “dream come true”. This time, election issues include employment, tap water supply to every household and crop losses due to stray cattle menace.Gorakhpur is home to Goraksh Peeth, established by Nath sect founder Guru Gorakhnath. Nath has been involved in political activities since the pre-independence era and remains an axis of power in UP till date. Its chief priest Mahant Digvijay Nath joined Congress in 1921 and was arrested for taking an “active part” in the Chauri Chaura incident. He joined Hindu Mahasabha in 1937. He spearheaded the Ram Janmabhoomi movement of 1949 at the end of which idols of Lord Ram appeared inside Babri Masjid. He was elected Gorakhpur MP in 1967.His successor, Mahant Avaidyanath, was elected MLA as an independent in 1962, 1967, 1969, 1974 and 1977, and an MP from Gorakhpur in 1970 and 1989. During the Ram Janmabhoomi movement, he joined BJP and got elected as Gorakhpur MP in 1991 and 1996.Avaidyanath’s successor Yogi Adityanath remained Gorakhpur MP for five terms from 1998 to 2017, when he vacated the seat to take over as Uttar Pradesh CM.This time, the constituency is witnessing a fight between Bhojpuri actor-turned politician Ravi Kishan of BJP and Bhojpuri actress Kajal Nishad of SP.In the 2019 LS polls too, BJP had fielded Kishan who defeated SP’s Rambhual Nishad by over 3 lakh votes. SP is eyeing Nishad and Yadav-Muslim votes by field ing Kajal Nishad. Goraknath Temple, where Yogi is still the chief priest, continues to be a centre of attraction for all.Gorakhpur constituency comprises five assembly segments — Campierganj, Pipraich, Gorakhpur Urban, Gorakhpur Rural and Sahjanwa – and covers the entire Gorakhpur district. There are around nine lakh OBC and six lakh upper caste voters out of which around 3.5 lakh are Nishads and 2.4 lakh Yadavs. There are 2.5 lakh Dalits and two lakh Muslims. The dominance of the riverine community of Nishads and their associated sub-castes plays a key role in poll outcome. That’s where SP’s Kajal claims her edge.Vishnu Kumar, a shopkeeper, says, “Campierganj has seen development, be it roads or lights. People will vote for development and not on caste lines,” he says.Rajkumar Nishad, a farmer from Sahjanwa, says: “I will vote for our own candidate. If BJP wins, then it will be due to Baba’s (CM Yogi’s) charisma.” Farmers in Machhligaon, Algarpur, are upset with stray cattle menace and water crisis and say they would support the party which promises relief from these two problems.Susheela Gaud, who is busy preparing tea and ‘jalebis’ at a tea stall at Bismipul in Campierganj, says: “People are facing water crisis and are dependent on hand pumps which are not in a good condition.”According to farm labourers Ashok Yadav, Santosh Kumar, and Raju Nishad from Lakshmipur and Algarpur villages in Campierganj, the govt has advised people to consume piped water only as there is arsenic contamination in water. They, however, say water supply is not sufficient. A group of jute mill workers and farmers sitting at a shop near Sahjanwa railway station say the station lacks public toilets and drinking water facility.“We get electricity and roads are also good. Development is taking place here,” says Susheela in Machhaligan village of Campierganj. A shop owner in Gol Ghar says that in the last few years, power supply has improved, and roads have been widened. “Sahjanwa is not developed like other parts of Gorakhpur, but it has firstclass roads and power supply,” says Umesh Yadav, a worker in a jute mill.A group of homemakers in Gol Bazar said: “I live near Nauka Vihar and have come here for household shopping at 7pm. This is something women in Gorakhpur couldn’t think of a few years ago as chain snatching, eve-teasing and harassment were common. Now, we freely use public transport and can come out for work even late at night,” says Anubhuti Jaiswal.New hotels, roads, sugar mills, fertilizer factories and improvement in law and order are drawing appreciation from people. “Once dead bodies used to float in Ramgarh Taal. Now, it has crystal clear water, and the cruise service has given the city a new look. Here people will vote for development and not for caste,” says Akash Yadav, who lives in Pipraich and works in a private hotel in Gorakhpur.","Once infamous for mafia and mosquitoes, Gorakhpur has projects of Rs 40,000 crore in various stages of completion.

"After decade-long wait, it’s finally a Tewari & Tandon show in Chandigarh",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-decade-long-wait-its-finally-a-tewari-tandon-show-in-chandigarh/articleshow/110547770.cms,"Man-To-Man Fight

BJP Loses An Ally, Cong Gains One

Changing Voter Base

CHANDIGARH: It’s once again a one-onone fight between BJP and Congress for the Chandigarh Lok Sabha constituency as has been the case in most of the elections since the city’s first parliamentary polls in 1967.The difference this time though is that it is not just a battle between two parties, but the culmination of more than a decade-long wait for the two main contenders — BJP’s Sanjay Tandon and Congress’s Manish Tewari .For two-time MP and former Union minister Tewari, 58, it is a homecoming he has been waiting for since 2009 polls. Born and raised in the city, Tewari learnt his first political lessons here. But since 1991, Congress brass kept its faith in its veteran functionary Pawan Kumar Bansal , who maintained a tight hold and resisted any new entrant in the city’s political landscape.Bansal won four of the eight elections he contested in, including three wins on the trot in 1999, 2004 and 2009. In the last two Lok Sabha polls, he suffered major defeats at the hands of BJP’s actorturned-politician Kirron Kher , who has also grown up in the city.For BJP’s Tandon, 60, the wait for nomination has been long and bitter. In 2014, he was the lead contender, but the party’s national leadership sprang a surprise by declaring Kher as candidate.There were internal squabbles and protests, but Tandon, the Chandigarh BJP state president at the time, went along with the party’s decision. Riding the Modi wave, Kher won easily in 2014 and 2019 elections. But relations between Tandon and Kher have remained cold if not bitter. This time, with Kher struggling with health issues and anti-incumbency at its peak, the party finally decided to repose its faith in Tandon.Within the overarching campaign narratives of ‘democracy in danger’ vs ‘10 years of vikas’, the Chandigarh campaign is also driven by the personality and background of the two candidates.Tewari, son of a noted educationist, poet and a former Rajya Sabha member V N Tewari, is a full-bred Congressman, having risen through the ranks — president of National Students Union of India from 1986 to 1993 and president of Indian Youth Congress from 1998 to 2003.On the other end, Tandon’s roots run deep in BJP and Sangh Parivar. His father, Balram Das Tandon, was an RSS pracharak and founding member of the Bharatiya Jan Sangh in 1951. Tandon learnt his first ideological lessons in the Sangh’s shakhas. His first major political responsibility was in 1991 when he was put in charge of the party’s Lok Sabha campaign. Despite being overlooked by BJP for the Chandigarh ticket, Tandon continued to work at the grassroot level building close relationships within the cadre and also with major stake holders and interest groups across the city.With Kher accused of being inaccessible and not on good terms with the Chandigarh administration, particularly in the last five years, party workers and residents have turned to Tandon. He has become the link between residents and administration. After Tewari was chosen Congress candidate, Tandon was quick to flaunt his wellcultivated connection, and labelled his rival an “outsider”. BJP also termed Tewari as a “bhagora” (runaway) for frequently changing his constituencies. “Where are you running off to in 2029?” is a rhetoric raised by Tandon in his campaigns.Tewari was Congress MP from Ludhiana in 2009, didn’t contest 2014 elections, and in 2019 was elected from Punjab’s Anandpur Sahib seat. However, Tewari’s poll pitch is that even though he was representing other constituencies, he still lives in Chandigarh and has funded several projects in the city through his MPLAD funds and raised issues related to the city in Parliament. His supporters are also quick to remind, “He is a son of the soil. His father was killed in Chandigarh by terrorists (in 1984).” Tewari has also raked up Tandon’s connection with disgraced BJP-nominated councillor Anil Masih, who was castigated by Supreme Court for his role in denying INDIA bloc victory in Chandigarh mayoral elections. Attacking Tandon, Tewari has said, “A vote for Tandon is a vote for Masih.”For the first time, Congress is contesting Chandigarh elections in alliance with AAP. In 2014, AAP had dented Congress’ vote share by garnering nearly 24% of the total votes polled. Congress’ vote share shrank by 20% from 2009. In 2019, AAP got only 4% of votes. Congress recovered around 13% of the lost vote share.BJP and its long-time ally, Shiromani Akali Dal, have parted ways this elections. Akalis, who hardly have a base in the constituency, had nominated their Chandigarh MC councillor Hardeep Singh as candidate but he gave up his ticket and quit the party, claiming no Akali leader was supporting him. He later joined AAP. BJP also suffered its first electoral setback in a decade in Chandigarh in the 2021 municipal corporation elections. AAP became the single largest party, followed by BJP and Congress, a development that may help Tewari.Rehabilitation colonies and villages, with nearly half of the city’s 6.6 lakh voters, are key to victory. They also have a higher propensity to get out and vote than those living in the sectorial grid. Migrants from Bihar and UP make up a major chunk of colonies and village voters. Issues like village and colony infrastructural development, regularisation of constructions outside lal dora, relief for building violations, traffic congestion, parking woes and ownership rights have consequently gained primacy in this election. And both candidates are on the same page regarding these issues.","BJP's Sanjay Tandon and Congress’s Manish Tewari are the two main contenders. Tandon was the lead contender in 2014, but the party's national leadership sprang a surprise by declaring Kirron Kher as candidate. relations between Kher and Tandon have remained cold if not bitter.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110547774,imgsize-1169703,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/110547774.jpg"
"As PM Modi takes ‘poll position’, battle boils down to win margin",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/as-pm-modi-takes-poll-position-battle-boils-down-to-win-margin/articleshow/110547634.cms,"Nothing seems to be more in focus for Prime Minister Narendra Modi except the numbers in his parliamentary constituency of Varanasi, which is one among those few seats where BJP requires least effort to ensure victory.Even the fiercest of the critics of the PM, who claim that there is only “cosmetic development” in some places and the much-needed works off the main roads have been neglected, believe that there is no contest as there is no match to PM Modi’s stature.The BJP, therefore, has shifted its focus on improving the tally of 2019 Lok Sabha elections. For this, a battery of top BJP functionaries, Union ministers, chief ministers, deputy chief ministers, MPs and MLAs have camped in Varanasi to boost the numbers.In 2019, the PM had a comfortable victory by a margin of around 4.79 lakh votes. He secured 6.74 lakh votes which was around 63% of the total votes polled. Samajwadi Party ’s Shalini Yadav, who has now joined the BJP, then got 1.95 lakh votes, while Congress’s Ajay Rai garnered 1.52 lakh votes.Total voter turnout in 2019 stood at 59.2%, which means that out of 17.84 lakh voters, 10.56 lakh stepped out to vote. In the last general elections Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party were in alliance while Congress contested alone. This time, Samajwadi Party and Congress have joined hands while the BSP has decided to go solo.Ajay Rai of the Congress is the INDIA bloc candidate while Athar Jamal Lari is contesting on BSP ticket. A month before the election, the BJP deployed its national general secretary Sunil Bansal to boost the morale of the cadre and make efforts to improve voting percentage and victory margin.According to party sources, he started off by convincing and cajoling those who were unhappy with the present party functionaries for some reason. During the roadshow of Prime Minister Narendra Modi a day before the filing of nomination, almost all the prominent BJP workers of Varanasi were present.Thereafter, to promote a feeling of belongingness, the party focused on personalizing the election campaign. As part of the strategy, BJP functionaries visited a total of 2,005 intellectuals, awardees of Padma Shri, Padma Bhushan and celebrities from Varanasi and handed them a personal letter from the Prime Minister urging them to vote and encourage others to do so.Under the guidance of Bansal, BJP is also handing over personalized letters to first-time voters of Varanasi. Out of the total 1.26 lakh identified voters, around 90,000 have been chosen for personalized letters.Each letter will have the name of the first-time voter and will be handed over to them by BJP workers. The exercise to distribute the letters has already begun and the target will be met by May 30. The letter is a request to the first-time voters to participate in the festival of democracy on June 1. “The idea behind this exercise is to ensure at least 60% voting this time so that the victory margin of the PM crosses at least 5 lakh mark if not more,” a BJP functionary said. INDIA bloc candidate, Ajay Rai, is relying on his supporters’ votes as he has been five-time MLA from Kolasla and then Pindra. He is also looking forward to getting support from Muslim and Yadav voters to challenge Modi.Athar Jamal Lari of the BSP is focusing on division among Muslim votes along with traditional Dalit votes loyal to BSP president Mayawati. Observers believe that the battle in Kashi is more about improving statistics rather than focusing on victory or defeat.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi's parliamentary constituency of Varanasi is one among those few seats where BJP requires least effort to ensure victory. The BJP, therefore, has shifted its focus on improving the tally of 2019 Lok Sabha elections. In 2019, the PM had a comfortable victory by a margin of around 4.79 lakh votes.

"Rishi Sunak sees 78 Tory MPs exit ahead of July poll, surpassing 1997 exodus before Tony Blair's win",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/rishi-sunak-sees-78-tory-mps-exit-ahead-of-july-poll-surpassing-1997-exodus-before-tony-blairs-win/articleshow/110445174.cms,"Britain's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak (AFP photo)

There were tears, anger and frustration as many Conservative lawmakers digested their PM Rishi Sunak 's decision to call the UK elections on July 4, much earlier than they had ever expected.

Some of those fighting to retain their seats feared the six weeks left to convince skeptical voters to back them would not be enough. For others planning to stand down, it meant an abrupt end to their political careers , forced to clear out their offices months earlier than planned.Trailing Labour by over 20 percentage points in polls, Sunak, analysts said, is betting that the Tories can cut their losses by facing the voters.

But a grassroots Conservative campaign coordinator said that the morale was the lowest he had known in five decades. Tory members of parliament seem to share this sense of futility: 78 of them have opted not to contest their seats, an exodus that includes Michael Gove, who once vied for party's top post and has been at the heart of nearly every Conservative-led govt since David Cameron's in 2010. Other high profile figures who have announced they will not seek re-election include former PM Theresa May, Northern Ireland minister Chris Heaton- Harris, ex-armed forces minister James Heappey and ex-defence minister Ben Wallace.

The number of Tories exiting is more than the previous post-1945 high of 72 who quit prior to Tony Blair's 1997 landslide win for Labour, which is expected to triumph again. The departures add to a feeling that the Conservatives are on track to be kicked out of power after 14 years, although Labour require a big swing to secure a majority. Sunak's decision to go to the polls early has triggered fears that he's leading the party to one or more ""Portillo"" moments - when a Tory big beast loses a safe seat in an election whitewash - named for the time cabinet minister Michael Portillo lost in Enfield Southgate in 1997.
