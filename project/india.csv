"'Jungle raj', which once haunted Bihar politics, may no longer strike fear, especially in youth",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jungle-raj-which-once-haunted-bihar-politics-may-no-longer-strike-fear-especially-in-youth/articleshow/124798613.cms,"‘Jungle Raj’: Amit Shah Slams RJD For Fielding Shahabuddin's Son In Bihar Elections

Among the late-night arrivals is Manish Kumar, 45, who has just got off the LTT Rajgir Express from Mumbai. He strikes a deal with an auto driver to travel home, around 40km across the Ganges. ""Bihar has changed. It is no longer the old Bihar,"" he says smiling.Two decades ago, such a scene would have been unthinkable. Once darkness fell, Patna Junction became a place of fear. Travellers locked themselves in waiting rooms or lay sleepless on station floors rather than risk stepping outside into the so-called ""jungle raj"".For nearly 30 years, Bihar's politics has been haunted by that phrase. Coined during the 1990-2005 tenure of Lalu Prasad and wife Rabri Devi, ""jungle raj"" became a shorthand for kidnappings, extortion and the breakdown of law and order. The opposition wielded the phrase relentlessly - a warning of chaos that might return if RJD regained power.Now, as Bihar moves towards its election, ""jungle raj"" is again echoing in speeches - though with diminished force. On Oct 23, PM Modi revived the phrase, saying ""people will not forget jungle raj in Bihar for another 100 years..."" The comments coincided with RJD mascot Tejashwi Prasad's formal declaration as Grand Alliance's CM candidate.The two-phase polling - a first in decades - has itself become a talking point. Union home minister Amit Shah recently argued that the shorter schedule, compared with the six phases held in earlier years, was proof that law and order had improved.But this time, the old narrative may no longer strike fear - especially among 1.6 crore voters between 18 and 29 years who never lived through the years of ""jungle raj"". ""After governing Bihar for 20 years, JDU and BJP are still contesting on the jungle raj narrative. It shows they don't have much work to speak about. Yes, law and order have improved, but crimes still happen every day,"" said Mohammad Jilani, 28, an auto driver at Patna airport.""If NDA keeps talking about jungle raj, it will sound like they are looking backward rather than forward,"" said Anurag Kumar, a first-time voter from Patna. Tanvir Aeijaz, associate professor at Ramjas College, said the ""politics of fear"" is waning as memories fade and aspirations rise.","""Jungle raj"" became shorthand for kidnappings, extortion and breakdown of law and order.

""Congress Only Party To Respect Him..."" Pappu Yadav Alleges BJP Sidelining Nitish Kumar in NDA

Poll Do you believe Nitish Kumar's return to NDA is a positive move for Bihar? Yes, it's a great decision No, it's not beneficial

NEW DELHI: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday reflected on his past alliances with the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), saying he had joined the party “because of circumstances.” Reaffirming his commitment to the NDA , he said he is “back in NDA for good.” He also criticised the RJD’s rule before his 20-year tenure as chief minister, saying, “pehle bahut bura haal tha,” and highlighted the shortcomings of the Lalu-Rabri governments, taking aim at their administration.Addressing his first election rally in Minapur, Muzaffarpur, Kumar took a dig at his rival Lalu Prasad and said, “Because of circumstances, I had to tie up with those people, but it did not take me long to realise that they were good for nothing. Now I am back (in NDA) for good.”Kumar recalled that his earlier alliances with the RJD in 2015 and 2022 both lasted less than two years. On both occasions, Lalu’s son Tejashwi Yadav, now leader of the opposition in Vidhan Sabha, served as his deputy chief minister.He highlighted his government’s focus on improving infrastructure, education, and healthcare in Bihar, and praised the Narendra Modi government at the Centre for its support.Talking about law and order, Kumar said, “An atmosphere of terror had prevailed in Bihar because of poor law and order and alleged patronage to criminals by the powers that be, until I took over. But now, it is for all to see how much things have changed.”He added that communal harmony has also improved. “Even disputes between Hindus and Muslims have come down because we were sensitive to needs like fencing of religious places of both faiths,” he said.Taking a swipe at Lalu Prasad, Kumar accused him of ignoring women’s welfare during his tenure. “Did the ones in power do anything for women? They could not have cared less. Only when, after seven years of chief ministership, a situation came where stepping down could not have been avoided, the wife was installed,” he said, referring to Rabri Devi’s appointment as chief minister in 1997.Kumar contrasted this with his own government’s focus on women’s empowerment, citing the success of self-help groups and the Mukhyamantri Mahila Rojgar Yojana, under which Rs 10,000 each has been transferred to over one crore women beneficiaries.Seeking a record fifth consecutive term, Nitish Kumar said he was disillusioned with the RJD after two short-lived alliances and has now decided to stay with the NDA for good.","Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar reflected on his past alliances with the Rashtriya Janata Dal.

KOCHI: Kerala HC on Friday quashed ownership certificates issued by state govt to actor Mohanlal for two pairs of ivory tusks and 13 ivory artefacts, along with govt orders that permitted him to declare their possession as part of the certification process. A division bench of Justice AK Jayasankaran Nambiar and Justice Jobin Sebastian held govt orders and certificates were void ab initio and legally unenforceable. It issued the order on pleas filed by James Mathew of Pathanamthitta & AA Paulose of Ernakulam challenging govt orders and certificates.It noted notifications issued by state permitting Mohanlal to submit declarations under Section 40(1) of Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, were not published in the official gazette, as mandated under Section 40(4) of the law. Petitioners also argued the notifications resulted from an invalid exercise of state's powers under statute and were, therefore, illegal and unenforceable. HC accepted these contentions.However, it clarified state was at liberty to issue a fresh notification, under Section 40(4), for conferring immunity envisaged under the provision to persons or classes of persons covered by the statute.",Kerala HC quashes ownership certificates issued by state govt to actor Mohanlal for two pairs of ivory tusks and 13 ivory artefacts.

Bihar polls: BJP almost confirms Nitish Kumar is NDA’s CM pick,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-polls-bjp-almost-confirms-nitish-kumar-is-ndas-cm-pick/articleshow/124773868.cms,"""Congress Only Party To Respect Him..."" Pappu Yadav Alleges BJP Sidelining Nitish Kumar in NDA

PATNA: Nitish Kumar is the leader and CM of NDA govt in Bihar and people trust him and PM Narendra Modi to deliver on their promises in the state, BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad said Thursday while NDA tore into INDIA bloc after the opposition named RJD ’s Tejashwi Prasad as its chief ministerial face before elections in Nov. NDA called the bloc’s move a “shameful alliance of corruption and opportunism”.“Charges have already been framed against Tejashwi in the IRCTC case. The court has stated that this is a very serious case of corruption. Tejashwi is an accused in this case under Section 420 of the IPC,” Prasad said. When reporters asked him who will be the NDA’s CM face, Prasad said: “Where is a vacancy?”BJP, JDU, and LJP (Ram Vilas) functionaries — joined by political strategist-turned-activist Prashant Kishor — accused the opposition bloc of pushing Bihar toward a “return of jungle raj” under the shadow of the alleged scam. Bihar deputy CM Samrat Choudhary of BJP said RJD was “torturing even its allies”. “This is a day of shame for Bihar that Grand Alliance promised to make the son of a thief the CM for sake of power. Everyone knows when Lalu was in office, criminals were encouraged. They want to bring back the same govt, and Congress is encouraging this.”The IRCTC land-for-jobs scam dates back to the period when RJD chief Lalu Prasad, as railway minister during first UPA govt of 2004-2009, allegedly awarded contracts for two railway hotels in exchange for land plots transferred to a firm linked to his family.Both Lalu and Tejashwi have denied wrongdoing, calling the case politically motivated.UP deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya said RJD-Congress tie-up was “a mismatched game”, recalling that Lalu was jailed during Congress’s tenure. “Now he is aligned with the same Congress. This alliance will not work in Bihar,” Maurya said.Union minister and LJP (RV) chief Chirag Paswan mocked the alliance for sidelining Congress. “After so many controversies, what would they do if they accepted your face? Congress was insulted as the face of just one man was visible in the entire press conference,” he said.JDU targeted both Tejashwi and INDIA bloc’s social arithmetic, taking a swipe at reports VIP chief Mukesh Sahani was promised the deputy CM post. “Laddoos for 2.60% of the Mallahs, pumpkins for 18% of the Muslims. Are Muslims there only to scare them to vote?” JDU wrote on X.Jan Suraaj founder Prashant Kishor ridiculed Tejashwi’s promise to provide govt jobs to one member of every family. “The one who promises three crore jobs isn’t saying what he did when his parents were in power. Now all that’s left to hear is that Tejashwi will make Bihar a golden Lanka in a few days,” he said.BJP national spokesperson Ajay Alok said Congress had “sold its self-respect” by agreeing to Tejashwi’s projection. “Sitting on a stage where Rahul Gandhi’s photo was not even on the poster, Ashok Gehlot exposed his party’s helplessness by declaring Tejashwi as CM face.... Let Nov 14 come, they will be seen fighting each other,” he said, referring to the date of poll results.","BJP, JDU, and LJP functionaries accuse the opposition bloc of pushing Bihar toward a “return of jungle raj” under the shadow of the alleged scam.

"Over 6,000 voters deleted for Rs 80 each in Aland: Karnataka SIT",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/over-6000-voters-deleted-for-rs-80-each-in-aland-karnataka-sit/articleshow/124771870.cms,"Rahul Gandhi Reveals '100% Proof Of Vote Chori', Accuses CEC Gyanesh Of Protecting Vote Thief

Deletions took place using VoIP between Dec 2022 & Feb 2023





BENGALURU: Karnataka police’s special investigation team probing the alleged voter deletion scam in Aland constituency during the 2023 assembly polls has reportedly uncovered evidence of attempts to remove names from the electoral rolls, and identified six suspects.Sleuths said deletions were carried out at a cyber centre in Aland, where operators were allegedly paid Rs 80 per application. SIT sources said they suspect accused paid Rs 4.8 lakh to those who facilitated the deletions. Officials are probing how the centre gained access to EC’s portal to file fake voter deletion requests. The probe was carried out by CID cyber crime unit before SIT took over. “At least 6,000 votes have been allegedly deleted,” a CID official said.According to CID sources, preliminary findings show that the deletions took place between Dec 2022 and Feb 2023 using voice over internet protocol (VoIP). “There were requests to delete 6,994 votes. While a few were genuine, most were bogus. The applications allegedly targeted Dalit and minority voters. The deletions were halted after the Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) ordered a status quo,” CID officials said.The irregularities have been traced to local resident Mohammed Ashfaq, who was questioned in Feb 2023 and let off. He is currently in Dubai and a blue corner notice is being processed to locate him.Aland, part of Kalaburagi district, is represented by Congress MLA B R Patil. He along with Kalaburagi district minister Priyank Kharge were the first to flag the irregularities to the CEO. The Congress govt later formed the SIT, headed by Additional Director General of Police B K Singh, after Rahul Gandhi raised allegations of vote theft in Aland— the home turf of Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge.Reacting to the reports, Priyank Kharge posted on X: ``Voters deleted for just Rs 80 in Aland. The latest findings from the Karnataka SIT confirm what we've been saying all along, over 6,000 genuine voters were struck off the rolls through a paid operation ahead of the 2023 elections in Aland. A full-fledged data centre was operating out of Kalaburagi, where operators were systematically deleting voters' names and tampering with our democratic process. All investigations now point to foul play by BJP functionaries and their associates. Every dirty trick and modus operandi from the BJP's #VoteChori playbook will be exposed, and every single person responsible will be held accountable and put behind bars.”On Oct 17, SIT searched the residences of former BJP MLA Subhash Guttedar, his sons, and their chartered accountant Mallikarjun Mahantagol, seizing seven laptops and several mobile phones.Following the revelations, Congress accused the BJP of vote theft, calling it a direct assault on democracy. “The truth about the BJP's vote theft is now before the country. The cost of deleting a vote was Rs 80. This exposé pertains to just one assembly seat. This 'vote theft' by BJP is a direct attack on democracy—where the rights of the poor and marginalised are being snatched, and their voices suppressed,” the party posted on X.Aland MLA BR Patil said he is unaware of the headway made by SIT and declined to comment, adding, “SIT is moving in the right direction.”","Sleuths said deletions were carried out at a cyber centre in Aland, where operators were allegedly paid Rs 80 per application.
