Seat share

What happened in the last assembly elections?

NEW DELHI: A Maharashtra opinion poll conducted earlier this week suggests that Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) will emerge as the single largest party, detailing how many seats the party is expected to win in the upcoming elections.The Matrize survey suggests that despite internal rifts and challenges within the MVA , the BJP-led alliance might have a strong showing.However, the final outcomes will depend on various factors, including voter turnout, alliance dynamics, and campaign strategies in the run-up to the elections.The Maharashtra Assembly elections are slated to take place later this year, but the Election Commission of India (ECI) has yet to announce the official schedule. While announcing polls in J&K and Haryana, the EC said it is keeping Maharashtra for later as the state is still dealing with heavy rain and has a long festive season and streak of religious events ahead. Besides, the EC added, the high requirement of forces in J&K did not leave scope for adding Maharashtra in the schedule announced on Friday.A tight race is expected between the ruling Mahayuti Alliance and the opposition's Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA). The survey also indicates that around 42 seats in the state will have a close contest.The ruling Mahayuti Alliance is composed of the BJP, Eknath Shinde's Shiv Sena, and Ajit Pawar's Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). The opposition MVA includes Shiv Sena (UBT), NCP ( Sharad Pawar ), and Congress.The Matrize survey reveals that BJP is projected to secure a 25.8% vote share.Congress is expected to follow with 18.6%, while Thackeray's Shiv Sena is predicted to garner 17.6%. Shinde's Shiv Sena is likely to obtain a 14.2% vote share. The two NCP factions are expected to have a vote share under 10%, with Ajit Pawar's faction estimated at 5.2% and Sharad Pawar's faction at 6.2%.Other parties are projected to collect 12.4% of the votes.The Maharashtra Assembly consists of a total of 288 seats. Regarding the seat share, BJP within the Mahayuti coalition is predicted to win between 95 to 105 seats. Shinde's Shiv Sena is forecasted to secure 19 to 24 seats, and Ajit Pawar's NCP wing is expected to get 7 to 12 seats.Within the MVA, Congress is likely to emerge as the largest party, with an estimated 42 to 47 seats. Thackeray's Shiv Sena is projected to win 26 to 31 seats, and Sharad Pawar's NCP faction is estimated to receive 23 to 28 seats. Other parties are expected to secure between 11 to 16 seats.This will be the first assembly election in Maharashtra with both Shiv Sena and the NCP represented by two separate factions.In the 2019 Maharashtra Assembly elections, BJP won 105 seats, while the unified Shiv Sena secured 56 seats. The combined NCP bagged 54 seats, and the Congress obtained 44 seats. Eventually, Thackeray formed the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance with Congress and NCP, and Thackeray assumed the position of chief minister.However, in June 2022, a split occurred within the Shiv Sena when Shinde, along with 39 other party MLAs, allied with the BJP, leading to the Mahayuti coalition coming to power.",The Maharashtra Assembly elections are slated to take place later this year. The Election Commission of India (ECI) has yet to announce the official schedule.

Second CM from Karnataka to face prosecution

BENGALURU: In a significant blow to Karnataka ’s 15-month-old Congress govt, governor Thaawar Chand Gehlot on Saturday sanctioned the prosecution of chief minister Siddaramaiah in relation to the alleged Mysore Urban Development Authority ( Muda ) land allotment scam.The decision prompted immediate demands from the opposition BJP-JD(S) for Siddaramaiah to step down on moral grounds, causing concern among the Congress leadership.The governor's sanction was granted under ""Section 17A of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, and Section 218 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023,"" following petitions submitted by activists Pradeep Kumar SP, TJ Abraham, and Snehamayi Krishna.The petitioners are anticipated to approach the court in the coming week. TJ Abraham, one of the complainants, expressed his intention to seek the special court for public representatives to acknowledge the governor's sanction.The controversy revolves around the alleged irregularities in the allotment of compensatory sites. At the heart of the scam is a 3.2-acre parcel of land that was gifted to the Chief Minister's wife, Parvathi, by her brother Mallikarjunaswamy in 2010.Following the acquisition of the land by Muda, Parvathi sought compensation and was subsequently allocated 14 plots. These plots are said to be substantially more valuable than the original piece of land.The opposition parties claim that the total value of the scam could potentially fall within the range of Rs 3,000 crore to Rs 4,000 crore.Karnataka's chief minister Siddaramaiah, aged 76, is facing prosecution while in office, making him the second CM in the state's history to face such charges. The first was BJP's BS Yediyurappa in 2011. Ironically, Siddaramaiah, who demanded Yediyurappa's resignation as opposition leader in 2011, now faces similar charges and growing demands for his own resignation. The current situation resembles the events of 2011.In Yediyurappa's case, the then governor HR Bhardwaj approved the prosecution on December 12, 2010, based on a petition from advocates Sirajin Basha and KN Balaraj. The sanction was granted under ""Section 19(1) of the Prevention of Corruption Act1988, and Section 197 of Criminal Procedure Code-1973."" This decision led to controversy and widespread protests by the BJP.Despite pressure, Yediyurappa did not resign immediately. He held a cabinet meeting to condemn the governor's decision and engaging in a lengthy legal battle. He eventually resigned after months of political pressure and following an indictment by the then Lokayukta Santosh Hegde in the illegal mining scandal.The sanction against Siddaramaiah adds to the list of rare but significant instances in Indian political history where governors have taken decisive actions against chief ministers. Similar scenarios have occurred in other states, such as the cases of J Jayalalithaa, AR Antulay, and Lalu Prasad Yadav, all of whom resigned following the sanction to prosecute them.","Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah is facing prosecution over the Muda scam.
