NDA VP pick to get 'unconditional' support from Shiv Sena,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nda-vp-pick-to-get-unconditional-support-from-shiv-sena/articleshow/123151936.cms,"NEW DELHI: Maharashtra deputy CM Eknath Shinde on Wednesday announced Shiv Sena's ""unconditional support"" to NDA's candidate for vice-president, potentially setting the line for other alliance partners to follow and increase the chances of BJP getting one of its own appointed to the constitutional position after the Sept 9 election.On a visit to Delhi, Shinde made the announcement after meeting home minister Amit Shah at his Parliament office. The election for the VP post has been necessitated following the resignation of Jagdeep Dhankhar last month.Shinde also met PM Narendra Modi and congratulated him on the success of Operation Sindoor and Operation Mahadev. The twin interactions were seen as significant. Sources said that the meeting attested to his equations with the BJP brass, with which it engineered the downfall of the Uddhav Thackeray-led MVA govt in 2022.Shinde said the 'Mahayuti' - alliance of BJP, Shiv Sena and NCP - would fight local body elections in Maharashtra together.He was accompanied by his wife Lata, son Shrikant and daughter-in-law Vru-shali as the family gifted a photograph of Lord Shiva to the PM. Shinde said Modi praised his son, who got the opportunity to lead a multi-party delegation to convey India's message of zero tolerance to terrorism.Shinde also rejected suggestions that his frequent visits to Delhi were linked to 'differences' with Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis, saying they were working together for development. Shinde also said he and his party MPs congratulated Shah on becoming India's longest-serving home minister.","Eknath Shinde announced Shiv Sena's ""unconditional support"" to NDA's candidate for vice-president.

"SC allows use of Stalin's name in TN schemes, says other govts do it too",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-allows-use-of-stalins-name-in-tn-schemes-says-other-govts-do-it-too/articleshow/123151278.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday said naming of welfare schemes after political netas was all pervasive in states and at Centre and ruled that no exception could be taken to Tamil Nadu govt's 'Ungaludan Stalin' scheme, which translates into 'Your's Stalin'.Setting aside Madras HC's July 31 interim order restraining use of names of political personalities in any govt scheme in TN, which goes to polls in April-May next year, a bench of Chief Justice Bhushan R Gavai, and Justices K Vinod Chandran and N V Anjaria penalised petitioner before the HC, AIADMK MP C Ve Shanmugam, with Rs 10 lakh.Dictating the order in open court after a more than hour-long hearing on appeals filed by DMK and TN govt, CJI Gavai said, ""Launching of schemes in the name of political netas is a phenomenon practised throughout the country. The Tamil Nadu govt has submitted a list of 45 welfare schemes (launched by states and Union govt) named after various political netas. We do not wish to name the schemes in order to cause embarrassment to political parties. ""While directing the AIADMK MP to deposit Rs 10 lakh within a week with the TN govt for utilisation in welfare schemes for the underprivileged, the CJI said, ""Time and again we have observed that political battles are to be fought in the electoral arena.Courts are not the place to fight political battles.""Interestingly, the CJI-led bench withdrew Shanmugam's writ petition before the HC to the SC and dismissed it terming it as ""fully misconceived and an abuse of the process of law"" for singling out the TN scheme and not challenging similar schemes prevalent in other states and at Centre.It allowed appeals of DMK and TN govt to set aside the HC order. DMK was represented by senior advocates Mukul Rohatgi and P Wilson. Rohatgi said SC had permitted use of photographs of the President, PM, CM and cabinet ministers in public advertisements to generate awareness among citizens about welfare schemesand that no political party in office has been immune to this phenomenon.For TN, senior advocate A M Singhvi supported the contentions of the party and said the scheme was meant to set up camps in every nook and corner of the state to enable and facilitate people of TN to avail full benefits of existing welfare schemes. Wilson said the AIADMK MP had approached Election Commission with the same allegation on July 21 for action against DMK and three days later, moved the HC alleging that EC was not taking action.Senior advocate Maninder Singh, appearing for the AIADMK MP, attempted to convince the court that a conjoint reading of a series of orders passed by SC on the issue took one to the conclusion that no welfare scheme could be named after political netas.After imposing a cost of Rs 10 lakh on Shanmugam, the bench said if the amount was not paid by the MP within a week, he would be liable for contempt of court proceedings.","Supreme Court rules that no exception can be taken to Tamil Nadu govt's 'Ungaludan Stalin' scheme, which translates into 'Your's Stalin' Set aside Madras HC's July 31 interim order restraining use of names of political personalities in any govt scheme.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123151296,imgsize-1701173,width-400,resizemode-4/123151296.jpg"
"Omar writes to all political parties for J&K’s statehood, calls it ‘essential course correction’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/omar-writes-to-all-political-parties-for-jks-statehood-calls-it-essential-course-correction/articleshow/123149599.cms,"SRINAGAR: Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah has written to all national parties, including BJP, asking for restoration of statehood to J&K. The CM said in his letter that a bill should be brought in the current session of Parliament for restoration of statehood.“The restoration must not be viewed as a concession but as an essential course correction, one that prevents us from sliding down a dangerous and slippery slope where the statehood of our constituent states is no longer regarded as a foundational and sacred constitutional right but reduced instead to a discretionary favour bestowed at the will of the central govt,” Omar wrote in his letter.On Aug 5, 2019 the Centre had nullified the provisions of Article 370 of the Constitution and reorganised J&K state into two Union Territories — J&K UT and Ladakh UT. The Supreme Court had on Dec 11, 2023 upheld govt’s decision nullifying Article 370 but had observed that J&K’s statehood should be restored as soon as possible.National Conference president Dr Farooq Abdullah supported Omar’s letter, saying Congress has convened a meeting of all opposition leaders in New Delhi on Thursday and that he would discuss the issue there.The opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP) welcomed Omar’s letter “for a collective push toward restoring statehood to J&K”.However, PDP said it was concerned about the “selective focus on statehood”. “The party wholeheartedly supports the call for statehood and stands ready to back any meaningful initiative that fulfils promises made to the people in Parliament, public forums, and before the Supreme Court, but it is disheartening to see that NC, under CM Omar Abdullah’s leadership, has not demonstrated equal urgency or clarity on the restoration of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status,” PDP said.Dr Abdullah dismissed PDP’s concerns and said it was PDP that had brought BJP to J&K by allying with it in 2015.Omar argued in his letter that federalism is anchored in the recognition of a state’s right to exist and function with dignity, autonomy, and constitutional protection. “If the Union were to assume and exercise the unilateral authority to downgrade a state to a UT, regardless of the justification it would mark a fundamental departure from the constitutional scheme. The circumstances may vary, but the precedent it sets is profound and unsettling. This is a constitutional red line, one that must never be crossed,” the letter said.“It (statehood to J&K) is an issue that goes beyond regional interests and touches the very core of India's constitutional values and democratic ethos. The act of reducing J&K from a state to a Union Territory in 2019 and the prolonged delay in restoring its status as a full state, you would agree, has profound implications for the future of Indian polity.”On July 16, senior Congress politicians Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi had written a joint letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi pressing for restoration of J&K’s statehood and had urged govt to introduce legislation in the current Monsoon Session of Parliament to restore statehood to J&K and grant constitutional safeguards under the Sixth Schedule to the UT of Ladakh.","Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah has written to all national parties, including BJP, asking for restoration of statehood to J&K.
