ED raids I-PAC-linked locations; Mamata alleges political vendetta

NEW DELHI: Several Trinamool Congress (TMC) leaders, including MPs Mahua Moitra and Derek O’Brien, were detained by Delhi police on Friday while protesting outside Union home minister Amit Shah’s residence and office.The protest was staged against the Enforcement Directorate (ED) raids conducted at the office of the political consultancy firm I-PAC in Kolkata on Thursday.TMC MPs gathered with placards reading “Bengal rejects Modi-Shah’s dirty politics”, highlighting their opposition to the ED action, which they termed politically motivated and aimed at intimidating the party ahead of the West Bengal Assembly elections.Speaking to the media during the protest, Mahua Moitra said, “Yesterday, entire India, Bengal witnessed how ED was misused by the Home Ministry. The ED was sent to steal our party's political, strategic information. Mamata Banerjee is a lioness, she protected our party's properties.”TMC MP Kirti Azad added, “They are acting undemocratically; even the raid was illegal. They loot and accuse us of scams. They took away our strategy and candidate lists. BJP’s internal survey shows they won’t get more than 25 seats. But Mamata Banerjee will secure a massive mandate as CM and go on to become the Prime Minister.”The protest comes ahead of a planned march in Delhi led by West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee. Banerjee will lead the march from Jadavpur 8B Bus Stand to Hazra More at 2 pm to protest the ED raids, news agency PTI reported.The raids at I-PAC offices targeted two locations in Kolkata on Thursday. Apart from providing political consultancy to TMC, I-PAC manages the party’s IT and media operations, making the action sensitive for the party’s electoral preparations.Banerjee visited the I-PAC premises during the ongoing search, accusing the central agency of attempting to seize internal documents, hard disks, and digital data linked to the party’s election strategy.The TMC has described the ED action as politically motivated harassment, intensifying the standoff between the ruling party in West Bengal and the Union government ahead of the assembly elections.On Thursday, ED conducted searches at multiple locations, including the residence of I-PAC chief Pratik Jain.Reacting sharply to the raids, CM Banerjee accused the Centre of pursuing a political vendetta and misusing central agencies ahead of elections. She alleged that party documents, hard disks and sensitive data were being seized under the guise of an investigation.Questioning the role of the ED and Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Banerjee said, “Is it the duty of the ED, Amit Shah to collect the party's hard disk, candidate list?... The nasty, naughty Home Minister who cannot protect the country and is taking away all my party documents. What will be the result if I raid the BJP party office?”She also linked the agency action to the ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) exercise in West Bengal, alleging that voter names were being deleted ahead of the polls.“On one side, they are deleting the names of all the voters by carrying out the SIR in West Bengal...Because of the elections, they are collecting all the information about my party,” she said. Banerjee further dared the BJP to fight the TMC politically if it wanted to win Bengal.Banerjee visited I-PAC’s Salt Lake office during the searches, asserting that the Trinamool Congress is a registered political party that pays income tax and cannot be “bulldozed using money and muscle power”.The BJP hit back at the chief minister, accusing her of interfering in a central agency probe. Leader of the Opposition in the West Bengal Assembly Suvendu Adhikari termed Banerjee’s visit to Pratik Jain’s residence during the ED raid as “unconstitutional” and alleged it amounted to direct interference in the investigation.Adhikari further said the ED should take action against the chief minister, claiming her presence along with that of the Kolkata police commissioner, was improper while the search was underway.Officials said the ED raids were conducted at 15 locations in connection with a fake government job scam, allegedly run by an organised gang that duped people by promising employment.",Several Trinamool Congress (TMC) leaders detained by Delhi police on Friday.

High Court: Neighbour can’t be dragged into dowry case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/high-court-neighbour-cant-be-dragged-into-dowry-case/articleshow/126425510.cms,".

BENGALURU: Neighbours cannot be casually dragged into dowry harassment cases, Karnataka high court has held, quashing criminal proceedings against a Bengaluru woman caught in a matrimonial dispute between a couple in her neighbourhood.“A stranger cannot be drawn into the proceedings for offences under Section 498A of IPC, between the husband, wife or family members,” Justice M Nagaprasanna observed, granting relief to Asha G.The case arose from a complaint lodged on Feb 13, 2021, at Mahalakshmi Layout police station, in which Munirathnamma accused her husband, Muthuram, his family and neighbour Asha of cruelty and harassment. Police registered a case under IPC sections 498A, 504, 506 and 323 and later filed a chargesheet naming Asha as accused no. 5, alleging she had instigated Munirathnamma’s husband to torture her.Challenging the proceedings, Asha contended that she had no role whatsoever in the matrimonial life of the complainant and she was “only a neighbour”. She argued that the lone allegation of instigation was insufficient to rope her into a dowry harassment case, and that she had been arraigned as an accused because of an “axe to grind”.Munirathnamma maintained that Asha was the “reason” for her husband’s behaviour and should therefore face trial.However, Justice Nagaprasanna noted that the petitioner’s name surfaced “nowhere except for the contention that she instigated the husband to torture the wife”. The court held Asha did not fall within the definition of “family” as contemplated under Section 498A.","The case arose from a complaint lodged on Feb 13, 2021, at Mahalakshmi Layout police station.

BJP Targets Mamata Banerjee Over ED Raid At I-PAC, Alleges Evidence Tampering

KOLKATA: TMC and I-PAC moved Calcutta high court Thursday challenging the legality of ED searches at the political consultancy's chief Pratik Jain's residence and the group's office, setting up a face-off with the agency that also approached the same bench alleging obstruction.According to details available on HC's website, TMC's petition names Union govt, ED and I-PAC as respondents. Sources said TMC has raised concerns over alleged access to party's confidential material linked to special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls, including information on booth-level agents, and documents connected to preparations for the 2026 Bengal polls.ED searched Jain's home on Loudon Street near central Kolkata's Park Street and I-PAC's office in Sector V, the city's IT hub in Salt Lake on the eastern fringe. The searches were linked to an alleged coal scam. Tension flared outside Jain's home when central forces accompanying ED allegedly asked personnel from Shakespeare Sarani police station - which covers the Park Street area - to remain outside the main gate. A verbal confrontation followed.Shakespeare Sarani police is preparing to register a suo motu case against ED and CRPF, alleging obstruction of police work.Jain's family is also considering a separate complaint, alleging family members were forcibly detained and that ED entered private areas without notice.Another suo motu case is being considered by Electronic Complex police station, which has jurisdiction over Sector V, alleging ED did not inform local police before the operation at I-PAC's office. ED has criticised Kolkata police for what it described as ""overactivity"".The court battle unfolds against the backdrop of TMC's long-running and electorally successful association with I-PAC that began in 2019. Over the next six-and-a-half years, TMC recorded a 100% strike rate with I-PAC on board, sweeping the 2021 assembly elections, winning the 2023 panchayat polls and retaining dominance in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections in Bengal.After the 2021 assembly polls, Kishor exited to pursue his own political plans, but I-PAC stayed on.","TMC and I-PAC moved Calcutta high court Thursday challenging legality of ED searches.

Pre-Poll Shock In Bengal As ED Raids I-PAC Office, CM Mamata Calls It Political Targeting By Centre

NEW DELHI: Enforcement Directorate on Thursday accused West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee of obstructing an ongoing money-laundering investigation, claiming that search operations were conducted “in a peaceful and professional manner till the arrival of the Bengal CM” along with senior state police officials.In a statement, the ED said it was carrying out searches at 10 premises, six in West Bengal and four in Delhi under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act in connection with an alleged coal smuggling syndicate led by Anup Majee.The ED alleged that proceedings were disrupted after Banerjee arrived at the residence of Pratik Jain, the I-PAC chief, accompanied by a large number of police personnel. “Mamata Banerjee entered the residential premises of Prateek Jain and took away key evidences including physical documents and electronic devices,” the agency said. It further claimed that the chief minister’s convoy then moved to I-PAC’s office, from where “Banerjee, her aides, and state police personnel forcibly removed physical documents and electronic evidences”.The agency said the investigation had uncovered links between the coal smuggling network and hawala operators, with proceeds of crime running into tens of crores of rupees. One such hawala operator, the ED claimed, had facilitated transactions to Indrapac Consulting Private Limited (I-PAC), a political consultancy firm associated with the Trinamool Congress.According to the ED, these actions resulted in obstruction of an ongoing investigation. The agency insisted that the searches were evidence-based, not targeted at any political establishment, and unrelated to elections. “No party office has been searched,” it said, adding that the operation was part of a routine crackdown on money laundering and conducted strictly in accordance with legal safeguards.Earlier, Banerjee rejected the allegations and accused the central agency of attempting to seize the TMC’s internal documents and election strategy. Speaking to reporters after visiting Jain’s residence and the I-PAC office in Salt Lake, she said ED officials were confiscating party documents, hard disks, laptops and mobile phones containing sensitive political data. “Is it the duty of the ED to collect political party data?” she asked, describing the searches as politically motivated and unconstitutional.Launching a sharp attack on the BJP leadership, Banerjee accused Union home minister Amit Shah of misusing central agencies to intimidate opposition parties. She alleged that the raid amounted to “political vendetta” and claimed the ED had begun searches early in the morning when no one was present at the office, allowing officials to access and copy election-related data.Speaking at a gatheringj later, the West Bengal CM said the truth would eventually prevail.""Truth will prevail; we will not interfere. But look at the BJP's conduct when we face them in a political manner,"" she said.Meanwhile, Trinamool Congress leader Kunal Ghosh led party workers and leaders in a protest in Kolkata.","The Enforcement Directorate accused West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee of obstructing an ongoing money-laundering investigation.
