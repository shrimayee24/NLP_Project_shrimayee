BENGALURU: The Karnataka high court will pronounce its verdict at 12 noon Tuesday on the petition filed by chief minister Siddaramaiah challenging the approval granted by governor Thaawar Chand Gehlot to investigate him in the alleged Mysuru Urban Development Authority (MUDA) alternative-site allotment case.Justice M. Nagaprasanna, who heard the matter in August, had reserved his decision on September 12.The judge had specified that the interim order granted on August 19 -- wherein the trial court was directed not to take any precipitative action against Siddaramaiah -- will continue till the disposal of his petition.On August 17, the governor had accorded sanction under Section 17A of the Prevention of Corruption Act , citing three applications. The complainants had alleged that the CM had misused his official position for allotment of alternative sites in his wife's name on the strength of certain fake documents in the layout formed by MUDA.Senior advocates Abhishek Singhvi and Ravivarma Kumar argued on behalf of Siddaramaiah, claiming the governor could not have gone against the advice tendered by the state cabinet.Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta had appeared on behalf of the governor's office and submitted that merely because the CM didn't attend the cabinet meeting that made the recommendation to the governor to withdraw the show-cause notice, it will not absolve him as the council of ministers is appointed as per his advice and there is an element of bias there. On this score, the governor is fully justified in not acting as per the advice of the cabinet.","The Karnataka high court will pronounce its verdict at 12 noon Tuesday on the petition filed by chief minister Siddaramaiah.

""Levelling unsubstantiated allegations against the PM and the Centre has become a hallmark of his political rhetoric,"" he said.Reddy said that even when combined, the number of seats Congress party has won in the last three polls, does not come close to what BJP has achieved on its own this year.Leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday alleged that BJP had snatched employment opportunities from the youth, forcing them to leave for foreign countries to take up work despite difficult work conditions.He also shared a video on social media of his recent interaction in the US with some immigrants from Haryana who spoke of their struggles and how it was unemployment that pushed them to leave for foreign countries.""Why did the youth of Haryana turn to Dunki?""

Opting for a second seat has made Omar look bullish on NC’s prospects but unsure about his own

BUDGAM/GANDERBAL: For all his primacy in J&K politics and his stewardship of National Conference , party mascot Omar Abdullah has failed to settle into a seat that could become synonymous with him over two decades of his career, as is the hallmark of political protagonists across the country. The second phase of voting on Wednesday will again spotlight the constituency-hopping by Abdullah Junior, who is trying his luck in 2024 from two seats - Ganderbal and Budgam .A former CM who has virtually led the party in two elections and has managed to strike a chord with workers and the larger electorate, Omar has changed his seat from Beerwah that he won in 2014.But Beerwah was not the original constituency that Omar represented. In 2008, he won from Ganderbal, represented by the two CMs from his family, grandfather Sheikh Abdullah and father Farooq Abdullah, and thus came to be known as the Abdullahs' turf. That year, Omar became the youngest CM of J&K. However, in 2002, when Omar sought to continue the family legacy in Ganderbal by taking the assembly plunge, he crashed to a shock defeat to PDP, in what was a tough election for NC statewide. The defeat possibly gnawed at his mind when he in 2014, in another tough contest predicted for the NC, shifted to Beerwah.Absence of a seat identified with Omar is incongruous with how politics is done in other parts of the country, where top players file the papers from a known pocket and then come to campaign on the last day. Returning to Ganderbal this year, after having shifted to Beerwah in 2014, betrayed Omar's desire to restore the family tag to the seat and make a permanent home.But his quick addition of Budgam to the list spoilt the optics and created a strange picture where he appears bullish about his party's prospects while being unsure of his own. The scenes of Omar holding his cap and asking for votes has only amplified the impression that he is apprehensive.May be, his concern is the aftershock of his surprise defeat in the Lok Sabha elections from Baramulla earlier in June, when maverick Engineer Rashid won by a huge margin while contesting from prison where he had been lodged since 2019.Former three-term MLA from Budgam before he became MP from Srinagar this year, Syed Aga Ruhullah Mehdi told TOI that it was the people of his former constituency that demanded that Omar contest from there. But Bashir Mir, the PDP candidate from Ganderbal who is mounting a strong challenge, said, ""Omar thought PDP will field some weak candidate. But when I came here, he realized it was difficult. That's why he sought a second seat."" Bashir ran the NC stalwart and Gujjar spiritual guide Mian Altaf Ahmad, now a Lok Sabha MP, close in Kangan in 2014 state polls, and has shifted to Ganderbal this year after neighbouring Kangan was reserved for STs.",The second phase of voting on Wednesday will again spotlight the constituency- hopping by Abdullah Junior.

The Abdullah family has represented Ganderbal since 1977, beginning with party founder Sheikh Abdullah, followed by his son Farooq Abdullah, and later Omar, who won the seat in 2008 after losing in 2002.Omar faces competition from jailed separatist cleric Sarjan Ahmad Barkati, who is running from both Beerwah and Ganderbal. Barkati hopes to replicate the success of Engineer Rashid, an independent who defeated former CM Omar and People's Conference chief Sajad Gani Lone in Baramulla during this summer's Lok Sabha elections despite being imprisoned in Tihar on terrorism-funding charges.Rashid's Awami Ittehad Party has fielded former Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industries president Sheikh Ashiq as an independent candidate in Ganderbal, while former CM Mehbooba Mufti's PDP has nominated Bashir Ahmad Mir for the same seat.The phase also features notable family rivalries. Choudhary Zulfikar Ali of BJP is competing against his nephew Javed Choudhary of NC in Budhal. BJP's Thakur Randhir Singh is up against his nephew Thakur Yasuvardhan Singh of NC in Sunderbani-Kalakote.About 25.7 lakh voters are eligible to cast their ballots in this phase, with voting taking place amid tight security following increased terrorist activity this summer, particularly in Rajouri, Poonch, and Reasi. From May 4 to Sept 13, 21 security personnel were killed in the Union territory - 17 in Jammu and four in Kashmir. Security forces have been deployed extensively, and vehicle checks are being conducted to ensure safety.BJP won 25 seats in Jammu division during the 2014 elections. Rajouri, Poonch and Reasi districts, which had 10 constituencies a decade ago, saw an additional seat added after the 2023 delimitation exercise, bringing the total to 11. BJP, Congress and PDP each secured three seats, while NC won one in 2014.With new political alignments and intensified campaigning, this phase promises to be a high-octane electoral contest. For BJP, PM Modi addressed a rally in Reasi district on Sept 19, Union home minister Amit Shah held five rallies in Rajouri and Poonch on Sept 21-22, defence minister Rajnath Singh held three, and Union roads minister Nitin Gadkari campaigned in Budhal.On the opposition side, NC-Congress alliance saw Lok Sabha opposition leader Rahul Gandhi and NC president Farooq Abdullah address a rally in Surankote.Polling officials, accompanied by paramilitary personnel, have already reached their stations, some located in remote, high-altitude areas surrounded by forests. EC has set up 3,502 polling stations across 15 constituencies in Kashmir and 11 in Jammu for voting, which will take place from 7am to 6pm. All polling stations will have webcasting facilities to ensure transparency.","Omar is contesting Ganderbal and Budgam. Raina seeks to retain his Nowshera seat in Rajouri.

'He is a disgrace': Congress slams TN RN Ravi governor for 'secularism' remark,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/he-is-a-disgrace-congress-slams-tn-governor-for-secularism-remark/articleshow/113619546.cms,"NEW DELHI: Congress on Tuesday lashed out at Tamil Nadu governor RN Ravi over his "" secularism was an European concept"" comment calling it ""outrageous and unacceptable"". Party general secretary Jairam Ramesh called for the sacking of Ravi, calling him a ""disgrace.""""This man, who has taken an oath on the Constitution, and who - inspite of his drumbeating - remains a Constitutional functionary, should be sacked forthwith.He is a disgrace,"" he said in a post on X.Ramesh called Ravi a ""trial balloon floater"" and claimed that he was echoing what the Prime Minister wants to get done.""This is not the first outrageous and unacceptable statement he has made. But he is only a trial balloon floater. He is echoing what the non-biological PM wants to get done,"" he said.The Tamil Nadu governor had stoked controversy on Monday after he alleged that former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had introduced secularism in the Constitution during the emergency to ""appease some sections of people"".""Secularism is not a Bhartiya concept, it is an European concept, let it be there, let them be happy with it. How can India be away from Dharma? "" Ravi told a convocation of Hindu Dharma Vidya Peetham at Thiruvattar in Kanyakumari.""In Europe, secularism came because there was a fight between the church and the king. They wanted to stop the fight which had been going on for hundreds of years. So they advocated separation between the Church and the King to ensure there was no interference with each other. In India, there is no need for secularism,"" he added.Ravi's comments had also drawn sharp criticism from DMK, who said that he should ""go and read the Constitution"".""Article 25 says that there should be a conscious freedom of religion that he doesn't know. He should go and read the Constitution fully. 22 languages are listed in our Constitution. Hindi is a language which is spoken by a few states. The remaining states speak other languages. The problem with the BJP is that they neither know India, nor the Constitution,"" DMK spokesperson TKS Elangovan said.It wasn't the first time that the Tamil Nadu Governor had controversy with his comments on secularism. Last year, he had said that those who wish to divide the country have misinterpreted the concept of secularism.","RN Ravi had said that secularism was an European concept.

THANE: The main accused in the case of sexually assaulting two nursery students in a Badlapur school died in retaliatory firing after he allegedly snatched a policeman's gun in a van and opened fire on Monday evening, said police.The 24-year-old accused, who was a sweeper in the school, snatched a revolver and fired three rounds at 6.15pm, claimed the police.Another cop returned fire in self-defence and hit him. The accused succumbed to his injuries in hospital.The sexual assault case had triggered national outrage, but police denied suggestions of an ""encounter killing"". Deputy CM Fadnavis, who holds the home portfolio, and CM Shinde said the police fired in self-defence after he opened fire at them.But the accused's family members alleged the police murdered him and sought a probe. His mother said, ""My son cannot kill a mosquito, how will he fire at the police?""MVA netas also called for a high-level probe. ""We have reasons to believe the law-enforcement agencies wanted to wind up the case,"" said Congress's Nana Patole.The family of the accused in the Badlapur school sexual assault case refused to accept his body after he died in police firing in a transit van and demanded a detailed probe into the circumstances leading to the killing. “The claims made by the police are baseless,” said his mother, referring to claims that he snatched a gun and opened fire.“I have preliminary information that when police were bringing him for investigation in a fresh case filed by his wife related to sexual assault, the incident occurred. We will get to know more about it, as police are still probing the incident,” said chief minister Eknath Shinde When the vehicle neared Mumbra bypass, the accused snatched the revolver of assistant police inspector Nilesh More. In response, another officer opened fire on the accused, injuring him.Sanjay Shinde, senior inspector of the Central crime branch, returned fire in selfdefence, resulting in the accused’s death. One bullet hit his temple, police said. More is undergoing treatment for bullet injuries on this thigh, the police said.The sexual assault took place in the school toilet on Aug 12 and five days later the accused was arrested. A massive protest followed the arrest with local citizens blocking the tracks on Aug 20 disrupting train services for over 10 hours. They demanded street justice by way of hanging him in public. Govt promised to try the case in a fast track court but it fell on deaf ears. Later, police resorted to lathi charge to disperse the crowd. The protesters also vandalised the school.In Badlapur, late on Monday, local citizens distributed sweets and said they were happy with the “encounter”.The case had put tremendous pressure on the state govt with the assembly elections planned in Nov. Bombay high court during several hearings expressed displeasure at the probe saying the cops took more than 11 hours before the FIR was registered. The court also questioned the police for not making the school management accused as they delayed in reporting the incident as mandated under the law. The opposition had highlighted the case to say the law-and-order situation in the state had collapsed. It had even called for a statewide bandh but was called off after the high court denied permission. Shiv Sena MP from Thane, Naresh Mhaske, defended the incident, questioning how the opposition was showing double standards. Initially, they demanded that he be hanged in public, and now they are questioning the action, which was possibly done in self-defence. “There were busloads coming to Badlapur with placards demanding capital punishment for the accused. This is nature’s law,” he said. MNS MLA Pramod (Raju) Patil congratulated the police.However, the opposition questioned the chain of events and also asked if it was a move to destroy evidence. NCP (SP) president Sharad Pawar on Monday demanded a high-level probe. “In fact, he should have been hanged. It was gross negligence and dereliction of duty by the home department while shifting the accused. It appears that the home department has not been able to tackle the situation,” Pawar posted on X.MPCC president Nana Patole demanded a judicial probe by a sitting judge of the Bombay high court. “We have reasons to believe the law-enforcement agencies wanted to wind up the entire case,” Patole said.","The 24-year-old accused, who was a sweeper in the school, snatched a revolver and fired three rounds at 6.15pm.
