Invoking inherent powers of HC under CrPC section 482, the judge quashed case against woman & her father. The court noted accusations lacked specific details regarding the alleged humiliation - such as time, place, & witnesses - and occurred entirely within the confines of a home.","Telangana HC quashed criminal proceedings against a woman and her father under SC & ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Act, 2015.

"Lawyer, 27, faked disappearance to escape marriage, traced to Nepal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lawyer-27-faked-disappearance-to-escape-marriage-traced-to-nepal/articleshow/123421063.cms,"Photo/IANS

BHOPAL: A 27-year-old MP lawyer and civil judge aspirant's desperation to escape family pressure to get married led her to meticulously plan a cross-border escape from Itarsi to Nepal's Kathmandu, dodging CCTVs, toll booths and police checkpoints to ensure she didn't leave any trail leading to the life of obscurity she desired.The 13-day search for Archana Tiwari - involving multiple teams from police, GRP and NDRF - culminated Wednesday in Nepal authorities confirming that an Indian woman found living incognito in Kathmandu matched the profile of the young lawyer reported missing by her family after boarding the Indore-Katni Narmada Express on Aug 7.Investigators said her circuitous escape route took her from Itarsi, where she got off the train with an acquaintance, to Kathmandu via Shujalpur, Indore, Hyderabad, Jodhpur, Delhi and then the UP-Nepal border.Her discarded bag had been found in the B3 coach of the train, leading her brother to file a complaint with GRP Katni on Aug 8, the day after Rakshabandhan.Police said they scanned footage from over 500 CCTV cameras, deployed NDRF personnel to scour a forested patch from Barkheda to Budni, and sent divers to search a 32-km stretch of the Narmada. The breakthrough came when investigators pored through her call records.""The name Saransh Jokchand popped up during the scan. Then one thing led to another,"" an officer said. Investigators found out that Saransh travelled with Archana by the Narmada Express and carried clothes for her to change into before getting into a pre-arranged taxi.Tejinder Singh helped the lawyer avoid being captured on surveillance cameras as he was familiar with areas of the railway station outside CCTV coverage. Archana had stopped using her mobile phones before her disappearing act, police said. She handed one of her phones to Tejinder, instructing him to activate it near Midghat and then discard it.Saransh's interrogation gave police enough clues to reconstruct her escape route. ""Being a lawyer, she knew that a missing person case lodged with GRP usually doesn't get pursued aggressively. She was probably convinced the trail would go cold, little knowing that the case would get the media attention it did,"" SP (railways) Rahul Lodha said.Police found out Archana had turned down at least five marriage proposals in recent months. Her family's decision to get her married to a revenue official was purportedly the last straw.","Archana Tiwari, 27, was reported missing by her family after boarding the Indore-Katni Narmada Express on Aug 7.

TOI could not independently verify his background. Based on the complainant's allegations, investigators had dug up 17 sites in Dharmasthala village for evidence and found some skeletons and bones.A woman named Sujatha Bhat, who had earlier alleged her daughter was missing from Dharmasthala since 2003, also did a volte face in a YouTube interview Friday, saying she had made the claim after being prompted by activists Girish Mattannavar and T Jayanti following an alleged property dispute with the temple.Meanwhile, Rathnamma, divorced wife of the accused, claimed her ex-husband was a compulsive liar who might have fabricated the mass burial claim to make money. At Dharmasthala, temple head Dharmadhikari Veerendra Heggade welcomed the arrest. tnn","The SIT arrested the complainant-witness Saturday after cops found inconsistencies in his statements during questioning.
