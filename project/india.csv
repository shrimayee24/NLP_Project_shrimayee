NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday asked the West Bengal police chief to file a personal affidavit responding to Election Commission's allegation that governing party TMC functionaries were making systematic, deliberate and concerted attempts to ""derail, paralyse and frustrate"" the special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls.Though state counsel Menaka Guruswamy strongly refuted the charges, its seriousness was not lost on a bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant, Justices Joymalya Bagchi and N V Anjaria, which also asked Manoj Pant, the former chief secretary-turned principal secretary to CM Mamata Banerjee, to verify whether prompt action was taken based on EC's complaint against those state govt officials deputed for SIR work.""We hope the state remembers the laws of the land,"" the bench said, hinting at the primacy of EC during the conduct of elections. Referring to its Jan 19 order directing the DGP, superintendents of police and collectors to maintain law and order at all cost, the bench said, ""We, therefore, direct the DGP to file a personal affidavit in response to EC's affidavit. We will take a final call with respect to the power of EC in this regard. Before doing so, we are giving the DGP an opportunity to file an explanation.""It was solicitor general Tushar Mehta who flagged the serious allegations in the EC affidavit detailing deliberate non-cooperation and inaction of the state govt coupled with an obstructionist stance and threats of violence given by TMC functionaries against EC officials.""A strong message must go that the Constitution applies in equal vigour to all states. Constitutional post holders cannot threaten EC officials,"" he said.EC counsel D S Naidu told the court that the state govt was not cooperating with it and not heeding its recommendations to act against state officials who committed illegal acts while under deputation to the commission for SIR work.While asking Pant to verify EC's allegations, SC said, ""EC shall be at liberty to replace the state govt officials on deputation for the SIR work but are not performing or acting contrary to instructions.""In its affidavit, EC said, ""While SIR is underway in 12 states, a controversy of the present nature where the ruling party in the state is actively involved in causing obstruction and issuing threats to officials is confined only to West Bengal.""""The material placed on record discloses that, through proper planning and concerted action, deliberate and systematic attempts are being made to derail, paralyse and frustrate SIR in West Bengal... Regrettably, this confederacy is not confined to fringe elements. The actions demonstrate complicity of all key actors of the State, including the govt, certain elected representatives of the ruling party, and party functionaries. Every trick in the armoury is being employed to ensure that the SIR process is either stopped or frustrated by fair or foul means,"" it said.","EC alleges that governing party TMC functionaries were making systematic, deliberate and concerted attempts to ""derail, paralyse and frustrate"" the special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls.

Opposition mulling notice to seek removal of Lok Sabha Speaker,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/opposition-mulling-notice-to-seek-removal-of-lok-sabha-speaker/articleshow/128128589.cms,"NEW DELHI: The opposition is seriously mulling a notice to seek the removal of Speaker Om Birla as the Chair of Lok Sabha, with leaders of India bloc discussing the issue on Monday - a move that may further embitter the fraught relations between the governing camp and the opposition.Sources said a notice floated during the day has collected signatures of over 100 MPs. The Speaker can be removed by a resolution passed by the LS under Article 94(c) of the Constitution, and the resolution requires a 14-day notice.Sources said another meeting of the opposition parties has been called on Tuesday morning to take a final view on the matter, especially about the timing.Unfazed, parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju made light of the opposition's plan, saying it lacks the numbers to carry the resolution.A possible resolution to the extreme step could be the Speaker's view on the opposition's demands Tuesday. Rahul along with T R Baalu, Akhilesh Yadav and Abhishek Banerjee met Birla after the House was adjourned prematurely amid protests Monday. The opposition grievances include lack of action against BJP MP Nishikant Dubey for his remarks, suspension of opposition members, and claim that women MPs posed a threat to the PM.As the India bloc partners gathered to discuss the strategy for Parliament in the wake of logjam in LS over repeated refusal of permission to speak to LoP Rahul Gandhi, sources said a senior Congress neta proposed a ""no confidence"" resolution against the Speaker.It elicited a nod from the gathering. However, TMC MP Shatabdi Roy reportedly said she would have to consult party supremo Mamata Banerjee before a reply. It was also proposed by TMC that the Speaker be first given a letter listing the grievances. However, ""it did not say no to the proposal once it was accepted"", a opposition neta pointed out. The meeting was attended by Mallikarjun Kharge, Rahul Gandhi, Ramgopal Yadav and Dharmendra Yadav (SP), John Brittas (CPM), N K Premachandran (RSP), T R Baalu (DMK), Sanjay Raut (Shiv Sena), K C Venugopal, Kodikunnil Suresh and Manickam Tagore (Congress), Mian Altaf (National Conference). NCP was not present.Sources said the notice with over 100 signatures was still to be signed by Trinamool and SP till the evening.It may be noted that the opposition discussed a no-confidence against then Chairman of RS Jagdeep Dhankhar for many months, but the issue came to fruition much later.Sources said while the matter was intensely discussed in the morning, a possible resolution was not ruled out. However, after Rahul was refused permission to speak at 12pm, a quick consultation among opposition parties ensued which reinforced the plan.","The opposition is seriously mulling a notice to seek the removal of Speaker Om Birla as the Chair of Lok Sabha.
