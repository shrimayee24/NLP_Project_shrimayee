Wayanad bypolls: Voting under way for Priyanka Gandhi Vadra's electoral debut,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/wayanad-bypolls-voting-under-way-for-priyanka-gandhi-vadras-electoral-debut/articleshow/115236152.cms,"NEW DELHI: Voting is currently under way in Kerala’s Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency as Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra makes her highly anticipated electoral debut.Polling started at 7 am and will continue until 6 pm.This bypoll gained importance after Rahul Gandhi , who held the seat since 2019, decided to vacate Wayanad to retain Raebareli in Uttar Pradesh, a seat he also won in the 2024 general elections. Days after the June 4 election results, Congress announced Rahul’s decision to vacate Wayanad, paving the way for Priyanka’s entry into the constituency.Priyanka is competing against 15 candidates, including Sathyan Mokeri of the Left Democratic Front (LDF) and Navya Haridas of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). The Election Commission has prepared extensively for this bypoll, distributing polling materials across 1,354 booths, all equipped with webcasting facilities to monitor the voting process.Historically a Congress stronghold, Wayanad has consistently elected Congress MPs since its establishment in 2008, with Rahul Gandhi securing landslide victories in both 2019 and 2024, with margins of 4.3 lakh and 3.6 lakh votes, respectively. The United Democratic Front (UDF) is now mounting an intensive campaign to secure a substantial win for Priyanka, banking on her appeal and the traditional Congress support base of minorities, settler farmers, and tribal communities. Her campaign rallies have drawn large female audiences, which the UDF interprets as a promising indicator for her chances in the election.Sathyan Mokeri, the LDF candidate, is focused on retaining the Left’s voter base, as he did in 2014 when he reduced the Congress's victory margin. Meanwhile, NDA candidate Navya Haridas has conducted a targeted campaign, focusing on key areas of support and reaching out to Christian voters by addressing issues like the waqf dispute.The campaign concluded with a “Kottikalasham” (festive closing ceremony), followed by a day of silent campaigning. Priyanka chose a low-key approach on election eve, visiting a farm and the Banasura Sagar dam, while her LDF and NDA counterparts engaged with voters across the constituency. UDF is hopeful for a turnout exceeding the 73.5% recorded in 2024, ideally reaching the 80.3% turnout seen in 2019.The LDF is relying on its organisational strength and Mokeri’s local recognition, while NDA aims to maintain the increased vote share it achieved in the 2024 general elections. With polling well underway, Wayanad’s 14.7 lakh voters will determine the outcome of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s first step into electoral politics.","Priyanka is competing against 15 candidates, including Sathyan Mokeri of the Left Democratic Front (LDF) and Navya Haridas of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) The Election Commission has prepared extensively for this bypoll, distributing polling materials across 1,354 booths.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115236250,imgsize-739793,width-400,resizemode-4/115236250.jpg"

We do what our seniors tell us to: Ajit on 2019 BJP talks

Proof Maharashtra sarkar is Adani sarkar: Opposition

MUMBAI: Industrialist Gautam Adani was part of political talks between BJP and the undivided Sharad Pawar-led NCP five years ago, Ajit Pawar said on Tuesday. He was referring to discussions that happened just before he joined hands with BJP and formed a short-lived govt with Devendra Fadnavis as CM and himself as deputy CM in 2019. “Amit Shah, Gautam Adani, Praful Patel, Fadnavis & Pawar Saheb... All were there...,” Ajit Pawar said in an interview to Newslaundry.When asked about the ideological incompatibility between NCP and BJP and his having gone with BJP in spite of it, he said BJP formed the govt in Maharashtra in 2014 after NCP declared outside support. “When results of the 2014 assembly polls were out, NCP spokesperson Praful Patel declared we will support BJP from outside,” Ajit said.After 2014 assembly polls, NCP spokesperson Praful Patel had declared support for BJP from outside, Ajit Pawar said, adding NCP later declared the support was not permanent but only for forming govt, resulting in BJP and Sena coming together again.Asked further on the subject, he said, “we do what our senior functionaries tell us” and referred to the ‘meeting’ before his early morning swearing-in with Fadnavis. “It has been five years, everyone knows where the meeting happened, it was in Delhi at a businessman’s house, everyone knows it. Yes, there were five meetings… Amit Shah was there, Gautam Adani was there, Praful Patel was there, Devendra Fadnavis was there, Pawar Saheb was there… All were there... Everything was decided.” He further said, “Blame for it has fallen on me, and I have taken it. I took blame and made others safe.”Asked why Pawar Senior then later hesitated and didn’t go with BJP, Ajit said he didn’t know the reason. “Pawar Saheb is a leader whose mind no one in the world can read. Not even our aunty (Sharad Pawar’s wife Pratibha) or our Supriya (Sule).” Sharad Pawar has consistently denied any involvement with power-sharing talks with BJP in 2019. BJP’s Devendra Fadnavis had alleged last year that Pawar had had a series of meeting with BJP between 2017 and 2019.Asked about him having split NCP, Ajit said there was no question of a split and “one who has the majority controls the party.”Questioned if the Pawar family could get together again, he said, “I haven’t thought about it now. Right now my focus is on the elections and on Mahayuti winning 175 seats.”On the matter of ideology, Ajit asked how Shiv Sena had allied with Congress and NCP for 2.5 years during MVA rule. “When we were told to work with them, we did.” He subsequently said, “Don’t ask about ideology. Maharashtra’s politics has changed. Everyone wants power and has kept ideology aside. They want to form and run a govt.”He denied that charges of corruption made against him had anything to do with him going with BJP. “Allegations were made in 2009 and I went with BJP in 2023,” he said. He further said he was cleared in cases because there was no evidence against him at all. “If I had been guilty, there would have been action against me,” he said.Ajit went back to Sharad Pawar after the swearing-in in 2019 as he could get the support of only a few NCP MLAs, with most party legislators sticking to Pawar Senior. Later in 2023, he carried a majority of the party’s legislators with him when he joined the Eknath Shinde-led Mahayuti govt.Congress and Shiv Sena (UBT) functionaries reacted sharply to Ajit Pawar’s revelation about industrialist Gautam Adani being part of BJP-NCP talks in 2019, saying it was proof the Maharashtra govt was “Adani sarkar.” Gautam Adani was not available for comment.Mumbai Congress president and MP Varsha Gaikwad said information had “come from the horse’s mouth” now. In a post on X, she said, “What was Gautam Adani’s locus standi, why was he sitting in the meetings regarding the formation of govt? I reiterate, MVA govt was destabilised only for Adani, so that he could get Dharavi and any other projects he wanted. This is why we say, this is not Maharashtra sarkar, but Adani sarkar. Now, the truth is there for everyone to see.”UBT Shiv Sena spokesperson and MP Priyanka Chaturvedi stated in a post, “As per Ajit Pawarji, this meeting was in 2019 when Devendra Fadnavis became the shortest duration chief minister in a very early morning ceremony… Adani sarkar for a reason. As per the interview given to a digital platform by a senior minister, Gautam Adani sat through in meetings to decide how to get BJP to power in the state by trying to fix unlikely alliances, it raises some serious questions. Is he a BJP authorised negotiator, has he been given the responsibility to fix alliances, why is a businessmen so keenly and closely working to bring BJP to power at any cost in Maharashtra?..Bol Dharavi Bol.”BJP did not comment but in the past, Fadnavis has said Sharad Pawar has had a series of meetings with BJP between 2017 and 2019.",NCP chief Ajit Pawar says industrialist Gautam Adani was part of political talks between BJP and undivided Sharad Pawar-led NCP five years ago.

MUMBAI: NCP candidate from Mankhurd Shivaji Nagar , Nawab Malik , said on Tuesday that the anti-conversion law mooted in BJP’s manifesto for Maharashtra is just being used to misguide people and his party will not join a govt with the saffron party “if it does politics on divisive and disputed issues”. Malik also did not rule out NCP joining hands with the opposition MVA in the event of a hung assembly.Though NCP is part of Mahayuti , BJP, the seniormost partner in the governing alliance, is backing Shinde Sena’s Suresh Patil in Mankhurd Shivaji Nagar.Stressing that if Mahayuti gets a majority, the govt will not be formed on BJP’s policies alone but on a Common Minimum Programme, Malik told TOI in an interview: “BJP will have to leave out some issues.”When asked about UP CM Yogi Adityanath’s ‘Batenge toh Katenge’ call, which is seen as anti-Muslim, Malik said: “I condemn this slogan. Religion based on politics is short-lived.” On BJP’s promise to bring anti-conversion law, Malik said: “Right to religion is a fundamental right and conversion cannot be stopped. BJP is playing with words to misguide people.”Malik said NCP chief Ajit Pawar will get enough seats to become a ‘kingmaker’ and dictate terms. “It’s possible that there will be a situation like 1999 when neither side has absolute majority.”When asked whether NCP could back MVA in a post-poll scenario, he said: “Anything is possible. Anyone can go with anyone.”",Nawab Malik says anti-conversion law mooted in BJP's manifesto is just being used to misguide people.

PUNE/NAGPUR: Congress continues to speak Pakistan’s language on J&K and the only way to permanently defeat such “anti-India forces” is to replicate the Haryana poll verdict in Maharashtra, PM Narendra Modi said Tuesday while campaigning for BJP in Pune.“Congress and its allies are trying to restore the provision (Article 370) that promoted terrorism and separatism in J&K,” he said. “They (Congress) are displaying a copy of the Constitution at every rally. I want to ask why they couldn’t implement the same Constitution in the entire country when they were in govt for several decades.”Modi accused Congress’s leadership of being “slaves” to a colonial mindset. “Maharashtra is the land of Shivaji Maharaj, but Congress prefers to praise Aurangzeb. Its figureheads curse Veer Savarkar. I challenge yuvraj (Rahul Gandhi) to hail Veer Savarkar and Balasaheb Thackeray in his speeches.”The PM branded Congress “a party devoid of integrity, only involved in appeasement politics”. “It is only interested in being in govt and, in to achieve that, it is dividing society based on caste,” he said.Modi alleged that the Congress govt in Karnataka was funding the party’s Maharashtra campaign. “Congress made tall promises and formed the govt in Karnataka, but now they are looting the people there. A part of that loot is being sent to Maharashtra for the elections.”At Chimur, Modi spoke of Congress’s “historical bias” against reservation and tribals. In Solapur, Modi described the opposition MVA as an alliance “trying to ride a vehicle with no wheels or brakes”. “It is quite clear that MVA cannot give a stable govt,” he said.","Modi accuses Congress’s leadership of being “slaves” to a colonial mindset. “Maharashtra is the land of Shivaji Maharaj, but Congress prefers to praise Aurangzeb.

During the searches, the agency seized various items, including fake Aadhaars, forged passports, illegal arms, property documents, cash, jewellery, printing papers and printing machines.“Blank proformas used for forging Aadhaar have been recovered, besides printing machines that printed fake Aadhaar cards,” the agency said.In Sept, ED had registered a case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act to probe a syndicate involved in providing shelter and legal documents to illegal Bangladeshi and Rohingya migrants . The Centre has declared its intention to carry out a multi-agency probe into illegal infiltration from Bangladesh with PM Modi blaming the JMM-Congress coalition in Jharkhand for the sudden rise of illegal migrants and the threat it poses to the state’s tribals.The ED has expanded its probe to look into the larger conspiracy where it suspects involvement of politicians and officials of the state administration, both in Jharkhand and West Bengal, behind the largescale infiltration from Bangladesh."," Enforcement Directorate is conducting searches at 17 locations in Jharkhand and West Bengal in connection with illegal Bangladeshi infiltration.

NEW DELHI: The stage is set for first phase of voting on 43 assembly seats in Jharkhand spread over 15 districts. The Phase 1 of elections in the state on Wednesday will decide the fate of several key leaders, including former chief minister Champai Soren who is contesting on a BJP ticket after ending his over four decades of association with the JMM. Chief minister Hemant Soren is going all out to retain power and faces a stiff challenge from the BJP which is keen to regain power after 5 years. Both the ruling ruling JMM-led INDIA bloc and the BJP led a high-decibel often bitter campaign to woo voters, especially tribals who hold the key in several seats.Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, who has anchored BJP's campaign in the state, has made Bangladeshi infiltration a key poll issue. Led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, all senior BJP leaders have attacked the Hemant Soren government for encouraging infiltration for political gains. Hemant Soren, with the help of Congress's top leadership, has countered BJP's offensive by accusing the saffron party of spreading the poison of communalism in the state.The BJP, which has ruled the state longest since it was carved off from Bihar in 2000, was voted out of power in 2019 as it could win only 25 of the 81 seats in Jharkhand assembly. The JMM, led by chief minister Hemant Soren, won 30 seats five years back and emerged as the single largest party. It joined hands with the Congress (16 seats) and Lalu Prasad's RJD, which had one seat, to lead a coalition government for five years. Hemant Soren, who had to quit the top post briefly after his arrest by the Enforcement Directorate in an alleged corruption case, returned on time to lead the INDIA bloc campaign and is confident that people of the state will give him another term.1.

She was in the BJP all her life and now she went to another party. Imported 'maal' doesn't work here; only original 'maal' does.""

NEW DELHI: Raghubar Das , governor of Odisha and former chief minister of Jharkhand, is neither contesting the 2024 assembly elections nor is a part of the election campaign, but when voters of the state go out to cast their ballot tomorrow he will be keeping his fingers crossed.Raghubar's daughter-in-law Purnima Das Sahu is the BJP candidate from Jamshedpur East assembly seat against Congress 's Ajoy Kumar. However, despite the high-profile candidature, her road to the state assembly has been made difficult by the presence of a BJP rebel Shiv Shankar Singh, who has resigned from party's primary membership accusing the saffron party of promoting dynasty politics and is contesting as an Independent.55-year-old Singh, who has an RSS background, voiced strong opposition to the BJP's decision to field Purnima from Jamshedpur East. He also pointed to several family members of influential figures who had been given tickets in the state, such as Meera Munda (wife of former Union minister and former Jharkhand CM Arjun Munda) from Potka and Babulal Soren (son of ex-CM Champai Soren) from Ghatsila.""How can the BJP criticise 'Pariwarvad' when they are practicing it themselves?"" Singh asked, adding that the party had no right to speak against it.Like Jamshedpur East, several other seats of the state may also see a three-cornered contest with parties failing to convince the rebels to withdraw from the race. As parties gear up for the battle of ballots, they are wary of rebels-turned Independents impacting the prospects of their official candidates.The state BJP has expelled 30 leaders from the party for contesting as Independent candidates against party nominees in various assembly seats. While not all of them may be in a position to impact the outcome, but they could damage the prospects of official candidates in seats where there is a close contest. The saffron party has already lost several leaders in the run up to the polls with many of those who were denied tickets quitting the party.The ruling Jharkhand Mukti Morch (JMM) also faces the problem of rebels, though not to the extent of the BJP. Several JMM leaders have also turned rebels and pose a challenge to the official candidates.Meanwhile, the Congress, which suffered a shock defeat in Haryana assembly elections by ignoring the threat posed by Independents, faces relatively less pressure on this front as it is the junior partner in the ruling coalition.AICC Jharkhand in-charge Ghulam Ahmad Mir interestingly admitted to the Haryana fiasco as he asserted there was no factionalism in the state unit like in Haryana and all decisions in the run up to the elections were taken by consensus among senior leaders.The Congress general secretary also claimed that there was ""pro-incumbency"" in favour of Jharkhand's INDIA bloc government which was moving forward under the leadership of Hemant Soren, while the BJP had ""headless voices"" with no one projected to lead the state.(With agency inputs)",Raghubar Das is neither contesting the 2024 assembly elections nor is a part of the election campaign.

NEW DELHI: Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray underwent further scrutiny by poll officials on Tuesday, a day after his bags were frisked when his chopper touched down in Yavatmal in poll-bound Maharashtra.A team of poll officials checked Thackeray's bags ahead of his rally in Latur as the Model Code of Conduct is in effect.In a video shared by Sena (UBT) on X, officials were seen inspecting the former chief minister’s bags after they were asked to show identity cards.""How much lower will the ' Election Commission ' go?"" the party said in its latest post.Former Maharashtra minister Aditya Thackeray also reacted to the incident, accusing the poll body of deliberately targeting the party chief to delay his campaign rallies.Taking to X, Aditya said, ""While the entirely compromised commission shamelessly continues to try and delay Uddhav Thackeray ji’s sabhas by frisking him, the question is: why aren’t the PM or other ministers visiting Maharashtra to promote the BJP’s loot being frisked this way?""""What a disgrace it’s turning out to be — this institution,"" he added.Meanwhile, the Election Commission responded to the allegations of selective frisking and said that enforcement agencies were following strict Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to ensure a level playing field for all parties.""Aircraft and helicopters of top leaders across the political spectrum are checked as part of standard operating procedure (SOP),"" said sources in the Election Commission, according to the news agency PTI.""There have been strict SOPs followed by enforcement agencies for a level playing field.

I don’t consider it democratic. This can’t be a democracy. In a democracy, no one is big or small,"" Thackeray said.He further said that if election authorities do not inspect the bags of senior leaders from the ruling alliance, then workers from Shiv Sena (UBT) and the opposition MVA will do so.",Uddhav Thackeray underwent further scrutiny by poll officials on Tuesday.

Hundreds fall victim to Goa cash-for-job scam,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hundreds-fall-victim-to-goa-cash-for-job-scam/articleshow/115231886.cms,"Goa CM Pramod Sawant

PANAJI: Hundreds of Goans have been duped of crores of rupees in a cash-for-jobs scam. Goa police have so far registered 20 cases across state — including 12 in North Goa district and eight in South Goa district — and arrested 19 people for promising to secure govt jobs in exchange for cash. The scam also saw a govt employee taking his life after his name figured in the case.Over the past few weeks, a new case has been registered almost every day, with a maximum of three FIRs each at Ponda, Agassaim and Bicholim police stations.Among those arrested include police personnel, senior govt officers, teachers and other persons claiming to have strong political links. The accused in different cases assured jobs in various state departments including public works, water resources, education, transport, revenue, police and health.The scam came to light last month when Goa police registered a case against one Pooja Naik for duping several people across state of crores of rupees by promising them govt job. Soon after Naik’s arrest, Goa CM Pramod Sawant warned politicians and govt employees of strict action in case of their involvement in the scam. Sawant also requested citizens to file complaints if they had paid to secure a govt job. “Govt jobs are not for sale,” the CM had said.Modus operandi in each case has been different. Naik, for instance, had allegedly told some acquaintances that since she worked at office of a regional political party in Panaji, she could obtain govt jobs for a certain consideration via senior govt officials in transport and public works departments.The latest on the long list of people arrested is a Porvorim resident, Shruti Prabhugaonkar, who claimed that she is BJP mahila block president for Nuvem constituency in South Goa. Though BJP accepted her association with the party, it was quick to add that she was not part of the party “today”.After Shruti’s arrest Tuesday, CM Sawant, without naming anyone, said: “BJP has five lakh general members. Even former party members, if found involved (in the job scam), will not be spared. That (person) was arrested.”In a stern message, the CM also said govt will seize and attach properties of those involved in cash-for-jobs scam and ensure victims get their money back. “ We will not stop just by filing cases. Property will be seized and attached. To ensure that money is returned, we will follow up every case till the end. We will ensure that the victims get their money back,” he said.Investigations revealed that victims were either known to the accused or have relatives who have been hunting for permanent govt jobs. Accused were using the money to pursue plush lifestyles of their own by purchasing gold ornaments and high-end cars.The scam also saw a 51-year-old attendant at OBC Corporation, Shridhar Kerkar, die by suicide after his name figured in the case. Shridhar had been missing from his house since Oct 30, a day after Naik and her accomplice, Ajit Shashikant Satarkar (49), were released on bail.Congress demanded a special probe but BJP maintained that it was its govt that unearthed the scam.","Goa police have so far registered 20 cases across state and arrested 19 people.

'BJP betrayal forced me to join MVA'

NAGPUR/YAVATMAL/NASHIK: Seething with anger after his bags were checked by officials at Wani in Yavatmal after his chopper touched down at the rally venue on Monday, Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray questioned Election Commission of India whether it will dare to rummage through bags of BJP brass, including Prime Minister Modi, home minister Amit Shah amidst the poll campaign.He expressed outrage while addressing packed rallies at Darhwa and Wani in Yavatmal and Chalisgaon in Jalgaon.A video circulated by the party shows Thackeray's bags being examined, a move he termed ""biased"" and was seen questioning officials deployed by the poll panel. He also directed his aides to film the incident and sarcastically asked an official if he was from Gujarat.""I don't mind if you check my water cans, fuel tank, or even my urine pot, but ensure you're checking Modi and Shah's bags too and send me those videos,"" he's heard telling the EC officials. Thackeray questioned why leaders from his party were subjected to scrutiny while BJP leaders breezed past without checks.Responding to Thackeray's jibe, Yavatmal collector Pankaj Ashiya said, ""This process is conducted in accordance with ECI instructions. Three days ago, when deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis visited Yavatmal district, his helicopter and bag were also inspected.""Addressing a rally at Darwha for Congress candidate Manikrao Thakre, Thackeray claimed the ECI was assigning his party's name and symbol to other factions, a veiled reference to rival leader Eknath Shinde's group. ""Treatment should be equal. Don't salute them as PM or CM here, they're just party campaigners, not heads of govt,"" he told the crowd.He also expressed concern over delay in delivering a verdict on split in Shiv Sena. ""Three Chief Justices of Supreme Court have retired in past two years, but the verdict has not come. This is not a fight for Shiv Sena, but for democracy. I am confident the court of the public will give me justice during the state assembly election,"" said Thackeray.Thackeray also called on ECI to ensure a level playing field, adding if they don't have the courage to apply same rules for all leaders, his Shiv Sainiks would take up the job. ""A few days ago, Shinde arrived with bags full of what he claimed were clothes. I challenge anyone to say how many clothes he can possibly wear in a day,"" said Thackeray.NCP (Sharad Pawar) MP Amol Kolhe too cried foul after his bag was checked by polling staff after he landed at a helipad in Vita town of Sangli district to address a rally for party's Vaibhav Patil. The poll staffers did not find anything suspicious. The MP had left for the rally venue, when his bags and helicopter were checked.Kolhe, in his speech, claimed such checks were done twice on Monday. ""I appeal to ECI officers to check bags of Shinde-Sena politicians too. They will surely find cash. Huge amounts were seized from an SUV at Khed Shivapur a few days ago. The money belonged to a Shiv Sena leader.""At the rally in Yavatmal, Uddhav Thackeray said he broke away from the saffron alliance after 2019 assembly polls due to BJP's ""betrayal"". He reminded the audience that the undivided Sena supported BJP in the abrogation of Article 370 in Kashmir. ""When Article 370 was removed, we stood with them because we believe Kashmir is an integral part of India,"" he said. ""But their betrayal forced me to ally with Congress. I will teach them a lesson — do what you may.""Referring to BJP's focus on Article 370 in Maharashtra assembly polls, Thackeray argued it was irrelevant to local issues like farmer suicides, low MSP for crops, unemployment, and water scarcity. ""Has abrogation of Article 370 stopped farmer suicides here?"" he questioned. ""The only visible benefit has been Adani acquiring land in Kashmir. Back when thousands of Kashmiri Pandits were fleeing, Modi and Shah were nowhere to be seen. It was my father, Balasaheb Thackeray, who welcomed them to Maharashtra.""",Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray questioned Election Commission of India whether it will dare to rummage through bags of BJP brass.

The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections , which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases. The results will be declared on November 23, along with Maharashtra.In the Tribal-dominated state, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and CM Hemant's Soren Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) are in a direct fight, while the Congress party and Lalu Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) are in alliance with the JMM.The JMM-Congress-RJD alliance are also reportedly seeking to deal with Left parties, Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party and other tribal outfits that have been contesting the elections in the state as independent entities and make efforts to field candidates against the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) on all 81 seats collectively.In the last assembly polls in 2019, the JMM-Congress-RJD alliance won a comfortable majority of 47 seats in a House of 81.The BJP slipped to 25 seats from 37 it held in 2014. The poor performance was perceived to be the outcome of its decision to contest alone backfiring. The party did not foster an alliance with the Ajsu in the 2019 polls when Raghubar Das, currently the Odisha governor, was serving the state as CM.In this year's Lok Sabha polls in Jharkhand, the BJP-led NDA secured nine out of the 14 seats, with the BJP winning eight and its alliance partner, the Ajsu (All Jharkhand Students Union) Party, retaining its single seat.On the other hand, the opposition India bloc improved its tally, increasing its seat count from two in 2019 to five in the parliamentary polls.BJP and JMM have spruced up their pace of campaigning from the ground zero to social media. BJP and JMM leaders are actively rebutting and challenging each other on a range of issues, including illegal immigration, youth welfare, employment and housing.INDIA bloc parties in Jharkhand slammed the EC for holding assembly elections in the state along with that of Maharashtra but claimed that they were ready to slug it out with BJP-led NDA, which has welcomed the announcement of poll dates.JMM, Congress, and CPI (ML-L) said the announcement showed that EC was in a hurry to conduct elections though the assembly tenure was due to end in January next year.Also, both the INDIA bloc and BJP-led NDA are expected to get into huddles to discuss the modalities of seat-sharing which is going to be a challenge for both the competing teams.","The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections, which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra. Elections in Maharashtra will be held in single phase on November 20. The counting of votes will be on November 23.Maharashtra is gearing up for elections as the two major political alliances—the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) and the Mahayuti—prepare to face each other for the first time in a Vidhan Sabha election.The Maha Vikas Aghadi, comprise of the Congress, the Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray), and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) under Sharad Pawar, will go head-to-head with the Mahayuti , which includes the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Shiv Sena faction led by Eknath Shinde, and the NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar. This will be the first electoral contest between these two alliances since the splits within the Shiv Sena and NCP.The MVA is hopeful of replicating its recent Lok Sabha success, while the Mahayuti aims to retain power by leveraging its populist schemes targeted at women and youth. Both alliances have set their sights on winning the state.Narayan Rane, a former Union Minister and the victor in the Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg Lok Sabha constituency, is poised to be a key figure for the BJP in the Konkan region during the forthcoming elections. Meanwhile, two constituencies are expected to be critical battlegrounds: chief minister Eknath Shinde's Kopri-Pachpakdi seat in Thane City and Worli in Mumbai, where Aaditya Thackeray, a leader of the Shiv Sena (UBT), is seeking reelection.In the last Vidhan Sabha elections in 2019, the BJP secured 26.1% of the votes, the Congress 16.1%, the NCP 16.9%, and the Shiv Sena 16.6%. The BJP and the Shiv Sena (then united) formed the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which secured a majority. However, the coalition soon crumbled due to disagreements over government formation, plunging the state into a political crisis.After no party could establish a government, Maharashtra was placed under President's rule. Devendra Fadnavis was briefly sworn in as chief minister, with Ajit Pawar as deputy chief minister. However, both resigned just days later before a scheduled floor test.By November 28, 2019, a new coalition emerged, with the Shiv Sena (Uddhav faction), NCP (Sharad Pawar faction), and Congress forming the Maha Vikas Aghadi government, led by Uddhav Thackeray as chief minister.The state's politics took another turn in June, 2022, when Uddhav Thackeray resigned following a rebellion within the Shiv Sena, led by Eknath Shinde, who then allied with the BJP. Eknath Shinde assumed the role of chief minister, with Devendra Fadnavis returning as deputy chief minister.",The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra. Elections in Maharashtra will be held in single phase on November 20. The counting of votes will be on November 23.
