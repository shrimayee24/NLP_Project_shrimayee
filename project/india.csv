AHEMDABAD: Counting of votes in the bypoll to the Vav assembly seat in Gujarat's Banaskantha district, where ruling BJP and opposition Congress were the main contenders, began on Saturday morning. The vote count for the bypoll held on November 13 commenced at 8 am at an engineering college in Jagana village, officials said.Nearly 160 election officials and 400 personnel of the Gujarat police and Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) have been deployed at the counting centre, the office of the Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) for Gujarat has said. A voter turnout of 70.55 per cent was recorded in the by-election. Out of the 3.10 lakh registered voters, nearly 2.19 lakh exercised their franchise at 321 polling booths using EVMs and VVPAT machines.The Vav seat fell vacant following the resignation of Congress MLA Geniben Thakor, who was elected to the Lok Sabha from Banaskantha in June. Congress candidate and former MLA Gulabsinh Rajput and BJP's Swaroopji Thakor are the main contestants, but the presence of BJP rebel Mavji Patel has made the bypoll a three-way fight. Patel (73), who comes from the dominant Chaudhary community, was suspended as BJP's primary member on Sunday for his decision to contest as an independent candidate.Seven other candidates - six independents and one from the Bharatiya Jan Parishad party - were also in the fray for the bypoll. BJP's Thakor had lost from the seat, a Congress bastion, to opposition party candidate Geniben Thakor in the 2022 assembly polls.The constituency has been a Congress stronghold, with Geniben winning the seat in 2017 and again in 2022. Patel had won the Vav seat in 1990 as a Janata Dal candidate. He then joined the opposition Congress, but switched to the ruling BJP in 2019 after being denied a ticket from Tharad seat in the 2017 assembly polls.","Counting of votes in the bypoll to the Vav assembly seat in Gujarat's Banaskantha district began on Saturday morning.

HYDERABAD: Telangana HC Friday set aside a single judge order of Sept 9 directing assembly secretary to convey within four weeks a time frame for adjudicating disqualification pleas against three turncoat BRS MLAs pending before the Speaker. The trio had joined Congress.The bench said that the Speaker must decide the pleas against Danam Nagender, Kadiam Srihari and Tellam Venkat Rao within a ""reasonable time"".The bench stressed that the Speaker, as chairman of the tribunal constituted under the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution, must keep in mind the purpose of this schedule and resultant anti-defection law .""The Speaker shall bear in mind the concept of reasonable time by taking into account the period of pendency of the disqualification petitions , the object of inclusion of Tenth Schedule to the Constitution as well as the tenure of the assembly,"" the bench further explained.The assembly secretary had challenged the single judge order, contending that courts could review decisions only after the Speaker took them and not before that.

Rahul Gandhi's exit paved way for Priyanka



Three-way contest in Wayanad



Congress's stronghold at stake



Priyanka's campaign rallies draw large crowds



The Wayanad parliamentary seat has captured national attention as Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra makes her electoral debut, contesting in the crucial bypoll from the constituency.Vadra faces competition from CPI veteran Sathyan Mokeri and BJP's Navya Haridas, with all eyes on whether she can replicate the victory of her brother, Rahul Gandhi, who vacated the seat earlier this year.Also read: Election results Of the 9.52 lakh votes polled, the district Congress leadership estimates close to six lakh votes for her. Its estimates for LDF candidate Sathyan Mokeri and BJP candidate Navya Haridas are close to two lakh and one lakh votes, respectively.“We are not at all worried about the victory or majority Priyanka Gandhi will secure. The low voter turnout will not impact the majority,” AICC general secretary KC Venugopal said, adding that AICC was examining the reasons for the “unexpected” low voter turnout.Also read: Bypoll Election Results 2024 Rahul Gandhi, who had held the Wayanad seat since 2019, announced his decision to vacate the constituency following his election in the 2024 general elections.Rahul, having secured victories in both Wayanad and Rae Bareli, chose to retain his seat in Uttar Pradesh, leading to the need for a by-poll in Wayanad. The Congress then nominated Priyanka Gandhi Vadra from the seat.Priyanka Gandhi’s entry into the electoral fray has triggered a high-profile contest in Wayanad, where she faces 15 other candidates, including Sathyan Mokeri of the LDF and Navya Haridas of the NDA. With political dynamics at play, this by-poll has become more than just a local contest.EC has taken extensive steps to ensure a smooth voting process, setting up 1,354 polling booths across the constituency, all equipped with webcasting facilities to monitor the election in real-time.Historically, Wayanad has been a Congress stronghold, with the party winning the seat in every election since its creation in 2008. Rahul Gandhi's victories in 2019 and 2024 were resounding, securing margins of 4.3 lakh and 3.6 lakh votes, respectively.However, the UDF (United Democratic Front) is now banking on Priyanka Gandhi’s popularity to carry the seat once again. The Congress hopes that her appeal, coupled with the party's traditional support base among minorities, settler farmers, and tribal communities, will help secure a significant win.Priyanka Gandhi’s campaign rallies have been marked by large female audiences, a trend that the UDF interprets as a positive sign for her electoral prospects.The rally crowds, coupled with the groundwork being laid by the party in the form of door-to-door outreach and community engagements, indicated that Priyanka positioned herself as a fresh and dynamic face for the constituency.","The Wayanad parliamentary seat has captured national attention as Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra makes her electoral debut.

We will discuss govt formation,"" former minister and UBT Sena politician Anil Parab said. The meeting was attended by Parab, UBT Sena MPs Sanjay Raut and Anil Desai, and Congress' Balasaheb Thorat.Raut said Sena (UBT) had made 'arrangements' in Mumbai for their MLAs from rural parts of the state to stay. ""Old MLAs have some arrangements but new ones may not,"" he said.Sharad Pawar claimed on Friday that MVA would secure 157 seats, while Uddhav Thackeray put the number at 160. MPCC president Nana Patole was confident of 150 to 155 seats. Sources in Congress said an internal survey revealed that MVA would win 158 seats, while Mahayuti would get 113. The survey stated that BJP would emerge as the single-largest party with 67 seats.AICC general secretary Ramesh Chennithala rejected reports that MVA would want to shift its legislators to neighbouring states. ""Our legislators have remained loyal even during the worst crises, so there is no need to shift them out of Maharashtra,"" he said.Parab said specific instructions had been given to all MVA candidates that they should be alert during counting of votes and if any untoward incident took place, it should be brought to the notice of the returning officer immediately; if there was no response, the matter should be escalated.Chennithala said he was confident MVA would form the govt ""with a clear majority"" and that there was no dispute over the CM's post. The decision on the CM would be taken after consulting all senior MVA functionaries and the AICC brass, he said.Incidentally, in the past five years, the state has seen two rounds of hotel and resort politics - once in 2019 when Shiv Sena walked out of the alliance with BJP and formed MVA, and then in 2022, when Eknath Shinde rebelled against Uddhav Thackeray's leadership with 40 MLAs. While in 2019, several MLAs from NCP had flown to Surat and then returned to form the MVA govt, in 2022, Sena MLAs backing Shinde first went to Surat, then Guwahati and then to Goa, from where they returned after Shinde took oath as CM.","Maha Vikas Aghadi comprising NCP (SP), Shiv Sena (UBT) and Congress has summoned all its winning candidates to Mumbai immediately after the poll results are declared on Saturday.

They just wanted to defame me and my party,"" Tawde said.BJP's general secretary further said: ""I am seriously hurt. I come from a regular middle-class family, for the last 40 years, I have been in politics but I have never done anything like that.

Senior Congress leaders have only given their remarks on this, and in democracy, we have the right to express our opinion. If you want to send legal notices, then it should be sent to BVA leaders Hitendra Thakur and Kshitij Thakur,"" said Anand Dubey.The opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) on Tuesday, a day before the polling, attacked BJP over the controversy around Vinod Tawde allegedly distributing money to voters.Congress's Rahul Gandhi said on X, ""Modiji, this Rs 5 crore has come from whose safe? Who looted the public's money and sent you in the tempo?"" Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray said the alleged cash for votes case was BJP's ‘note jihad, and Supriya Sule of NCP (SP) wondered where so much cash had come from post-demonetisation.Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge posted on X, ""PM Modi wants to make Maharashtra ‘safe' with ‘money power' and ‘muscle power.' On one hand, there is a deadly attack on the former home minister (Anil Deshmukh) of the state, on the other hand, a senior BJP leader is caught red-handed with Rs 5 crore in cash.

NEW DELHI: The BJP-led NDA and the opposition's INDIA bloc will keep their fingers crossed a day ahead of the counting of votes in Maharashtra and Jharkhand as they anxiously await the people's verdict in the two states.With the exit polls throwing up a diverse range of predictions, both the camps are gearing up for all eventualities and possibilities. With some exit polls predicting neck and neck battle, the parties are busy preparing their Plan B, and even Plan C, to tide over the possible challenges that may come their way after the actual numbers are out.The Maha Vikas Aghadi constituents have decided to house all their newly-elected MLAs together in Mumbai after the election results. Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut said the move is aimed at preventing poaching ahead of government formation. The Congress has appointed observers for both states to oversee the post-election scenarios. Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge deputed Ashok Gehlot, Bhupesh Baghel and G Parameshwara as AICC observers to Maharashtra with immediate effect, while for Jharkhand, Tariq Anwar, Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka and Krishna Allavuru have been named observers.On the Mahayuti side, Ramdas Athawale, who is a Union minister and chief of RPI(A), claimed that Maharashtra's ruling alliance is confident of victory but is still in touch with several Independents. If the Maharashtra mandate is fractured, the state could see a flurry of political activities including defections and even realignments.In 2019, the state was witness to one of the biggest political realignments over the CM post when the then-divided Shiv Sena dumped BJP to join hands with the long-time nemesis NCP and the Congress party, which paved the way for Uddhav Thackeray to take oath as Maharashtra chief minister under the Maha Vikas Agahadi alliance.In 2022, the Shiv Sena, which was the largest party in the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), saw a vertical split when Eknath Shinde and 39 other MLAs revolted against Uddhav Thackeray and joined hands with BJP.The defection of a majority of Sena MLAs led to the collapse of the MVA government, prompting Uddhav to resign as CM.Several political leaders credited Fadnavis for engineering the split in Shiv Sena. The BJP leader himself admitted to playing a key role in the Shinde-led revolt, calling it ""an act of revenge"".Later, the the BJP leadership, in a surprise move, decided to give the post of chief minister to Shinde, whose rebellion helped the NDA return to power in the state.However, the Mahayuti faced a major setback in this year's Lok Sabha polls as the ruling alliance was able to win only 17 seats out of the 48 seats, while the MVA won 31 seats, including one independent candidate.When considering the possibility of realignment in Maharashtra, Jharkhand is not far aloof as exit polls have projected a hung assembly in the state with the BJP-led NDA and the JMM-led INDIA bloc involved in a neck-and-neck race.Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren's JMM, however, on Thursday junked the exit polls, which gave the BJP-led NDA an edge, and claimed that the INDIA bloc would return to office for another term with a bigger mandate.Reacting to JMM's claims, the BJP said it was a last-minute effort to console their dejected party workers. ""Only two days remain. JMM and Congress can pat their own backs, but the reality is that the people of Jharkhand have voted for a change this time,"" BJP's state spokesperson Pradeep Sinha.Irrespective of the claims made by the party, there's no suspense that if the Jharkhand electorate throws up a hung assembly, as projected by the exit polls, the state may see a shift in allegiances.","Maha Vikas Aghadi constituents have decided to house all their newly-elected MLAs together in Mumbai after the election results. The Congress has appointed observers for both states to oversee the post-election scenarios. If the Maharashtra mandate is fractured, the state could see a flurry of political activities including defections and even realignments.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115575048,imgsize-1783135,width-400,resizemode-4/115575048.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Two more exit poll agencies released their projections on Thursday giving boost to Eknath-Shinde led Mahayuti in Maharashtra assembly elections.According to Today's Chanakya exit poll predictions, Mahayuti is projected to secure 175 ± 11 seats, while the Congress-led Maha Vikas Agadi (MVA) is expected to win 100 ± 11 seats. The agency has projected 13 ± 5 seats for other parties and independents.Meanwhile, Axis My India also predicted 178-200 seats for Mahayuti and 82-102 for MVA. The agency has predicted 6-12 seats for others and Independents.The Axis My India exit poll results have also revealed that Eknath Shinde is the preferred chief minister choice at 31 per cent, followed by Uddhav Thackeray at 18 per cent and Devendra Fadnavis at 12 per cent.With this, the Mahayuti is now projected to win 168 seats, according to the poll of polls, MVA 109 and others are likely to get 11 seats.The two exit poll results are in line with the projections released a day earlier where most polls on predicted victory for the BJP-led alliance in Maharashtra.On Wednesday, three pollsters - Peoples Pulse, Matrize and Chankya Strategies predicted clear majority for the Mahayuti while three - P-Marq, Dainik Bhaskar and Poll Diary predicted Mahayuti ahead of the MVA, but short of majority.The Matrize exit poll predicted 150-170 seats for the BJP and allies in Maharashtra with a 48 per cent vote share, it gave the Congress and other allies only 110-130 seats with a vote share of 42 per cent. The poll gave others 8 to 10 seats, with a vote share of 10 per cent. People's Pulse gave NDA's Mahayuti a whopping 175-195 seats while giving only 85-112 seats to MVA and 7-12 to others in Maharashtra.The actual results will be announced by the Election Commission on November 23.During the 2019 assembly elections, BJP had secured its position as the dominant party by winning 105 seats, whilst their alliance partner Shiv Sena obtained 56 seats. A disagreement over the chief minister's position led to Uddhav Thackeray's separation from the BJP. Subsequently, he established the MVA administration with support from Congress and the NCP, which had secured 44 and 54 seats respectively.The BJP orchestrated its response in 2022 when Eknath Shinde caused a division within the Shiv Sena, leading to the MVA government's collapse. The BJP then appointed Shinde as the chief minister. The following year, Ajit Pawar's rebellion against his uncle Sharad Pawar and the subsequent NCP split resulted in the formation of the Mahayuti.","Two more exit poll agencies released their projections on Thursday giving boost to Eknath-Shinde led Mahayuti in Maharashtra assembly elections.

Jharkhand verdict today: All eyes on who will form next government in state,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jharkhand-verdict-today-all-eyes-on-who-will-form-next-government-in-state/articleshow/115582246.cms,"Also See:

RANCHI: Several political parties, including JMM, Congress, RJD, BJP, Ajsu-P, JD(U), LJP(R) and newly formed JKLM along with 1,128 candidates in total are anxiously awaiting the outcome of the battle of ballots, which will be declared on Saturday. Of two political camps - the BJP-led NDA - has been favoured by most exit polls to beat the INDIA bloc led by JMM to form the next govt in Jharkhand.With the voter turnout across the 81 assembly constituencies, which went to polls in two phases (Nov 13 and Nov 20), posting an all-time high turnout of over 67% since the state's inception in 2000, both camps on Friday claimed that they would form the next govt by comfortably crossing the majority mark of 41 seats. Counting is expected to commence at 8 am. As candidates spent anxious moments, heavyweights like Hemant Soren and his wife Kalpana held meetings with the party's senior leadership about preparations for the counting day. BJP state president Babulal Marandi, who is a candidate from the Dhanwar assembly segment in Giridih district, held meetings with the party's booth committee members at the party office here on Friday.Saturday's counting will be a test of the Hemant-led govt's key welfare schemes, including the Maiya Samman Yojana , Abua Awas Yojana, universal pension schemes for the elderly, widows and the differently abled, and the old pension scheme for the state govt employees. It will also be a test of popularity and acceptance for Hemant himself following his arrest by the ED and a five-month imprisonment in a land scam case earlier this year.The election comes close on the heels of the Lok Sabha polls, where the NDA won nine out of the 14 parliamentary seats in the state, while the INDIA bloc won only five. The electoral battle was also played out three months after Hemant, who served five months in jail, took over the reins of the govt on July 4 after deposing his ""chacha"" Champai Soren. Miffed, Champai crossed over to BJP a month later.BJP with its allies Ajsu-P, JD(U), and LJP (R), based its campaigning on attacking the outgoing Hemant govt over corruption, question paper leaks of recruitment tests and the death of excise constable aspirants. However, the thrust of BJP was the alleged changing demographics of the tribal hinterlands of the state due to the illegal Bangladeshi infiltrators. Its star campaigners like PM Narendra Modi, UP CM Yogi Adityanath and Union Home Minister Amit Shah, attacked JMM and Congress over the issue, with Modi and Yogi raising slogans such as ""Ek rahenge toh safe rahenge"" and ""Batenge toh Katenge"".While BJP fielded candidates on 68 seats, Ajsu-P contested 10. Their ally JD(U) fought on two seats, while LJP (R) contested on one seat. On the other hand, JMM fought 43 seats, while Congress fielded candidates on 30 seats. RJD and CPI-ML contested in four seats each.High turnout of women voters in the state indicated that the INDIA bloc's announcement of hiking the monthly stipends under its Maiya Samman Yojana and BJP's promise of 'Go go Didi Yojana' struck a chord with them. INDIA bloc leaders, including Rahul Gandhi, attempted to woo the electorate by promising a caste census and increasing the reservation ceiling from the existing 50%.""We have given respect and recognition to the state's women in the past five years and presented a clear roadmap for the state before the people. Unlike BJP, we did not campaign on baseless statements. That is why we are confident of a great result tomorrow,"" said Ghulam Ahmed Mir, the AICC's Jharkhand-in-charge, on Friday.BJP spokesperson Ajay Shah claimed NDA will clean sweep most of the seats in Kolhan and Santhal Pargana regions, helping it to clinch 60% of the seats. ""We will be in a comfortable position to form the govt,"" he claimed.","The BJP-led NDA has been favoured by most exit polls to beat the INDIA bloc led by JMM to form the next govt in Jharkhand.

Two young leaders from prominent political families are facing off in the Bandra East Assembly seat also known as Vandre East . Zeeshan Siddique and Varun Sardesai are competing for the seat in the upcoming election. Siddique, son of NCP leader Baba Siddique who was murdered earlier this year, is contesting on behalf of Ajit Pawar-led NCP. Varun Sardesai, nephew-in-law of Uddhav Thackeray, has been fielded by the Shiv Sena (UBT) MVA.The constituency is known for its diverse population including Marathi-speakers, Dalit, Muslim, slum, and migrant. These communities make up a significant portion of the voters in the area. This makes Bandra East an important area in Maharashtra politics. Bandra East is one of Maharashtra's 288 assembly constituencies.In the 2019 election, Bandra East had 251,371 registered voters, with 126,597 valid votes cast. Indian National Congress candidate Zeeshan Baba Siddique won the seat with 38,337 votes. Shiv Sena candidate Prin Vishwanath Pandurang Mahadeshwar came in second with 32,547 votes, resulting in a victory margin of 5,790 votes. In the 2014 election, Vandre East had 263,798 voters, with 124,555 valid votes.Shiv Sena's Prakash (Bala) Sawant won with 41,388 votes, defeating BJP candidate Krishna Dhondu Parkar, who received 25,791 votes, by a margin of 15,597 votes. Following the 2019 Maharashtra Assembly elections, the BJP-led NDA initially formed the government. However, internal divisions in the Shiv Sena led Uddhav Thackeray to form theMaha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition with the NCP and Congress, making him chief minister. In 2022, Eknath Shinde broke from Thackeray's faction, allied with the BJP, and became chief minister, leading to the MVA's collapse.In 2023, Ajit Pawar split from the NCP to join Shinde's BJP alliance. Maharashtra politics is now dominated by two alliances: the MVA (Shiv Sena UBT, NCP SP, Congress) and the Maha Yuti (BJP, Shinde’s Sena, Ajit Pawar’s NCP).The voting for this constituency was scheduled for November 20 and results would be announced on November 23. In the 2024 elections, Zeeshan Baba Siddique, son of NCP leader Baba Siddique who was murdered earlier this year, is one of the prominent candidates.","Zeeshan Siddique and Varun Sardesai are competing for the seat in the upcoming election.

CHANDIGARH: In a “significant organisational shift”, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Friday named cabinet minister Aman Arora (50) as the state unit president, replacing chief minister Bhagwant Mann , and Batala MLA Amansher Singh Shery Kalsi as the working president. This comes nearly a month after Mann expressed his desire to step down from party post, citing his responsibilities as the CM.The appointment of Arora – whom the party press release decribed as “a prominent Hindu leader known for his inclusive approach and dynamic leadership” – would help the ruling party attract Hindu voters and counter the attempts being made by the BJP to expand its footprint in the state. In the recent Lok Sabha elections, the saffron party’s vote share increased to 18% from 6.6% in 2022. Hindus, who constitute 38.49 % of the population as per the 2011 census, have a sizable vote share in as many as 34 assembly constituencies in the state.Mann announced the appointment on X saying, “I have full confidence in both my colleagues that they will strengthen the party and the organisation .”Speaking to the media after meeting Mann, Arora and Kalsi thanked the CM and AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal for choosing them. Asked about the challenges before him, Arora said, “The AAP govt has no negative baggage. All we need to do is highlight our developmental works and you will see it reflected in the results of the four assembly bypolls.”In an interview to a private channel, Arora said, “In politics, no section can be ignored. AAP is the most secular party, but apart from parties, people also do expect that every community will get representation.” He was replying to a question on the party’s attempts at balancing caste dynamics in the state.Mann was first appointed AAP Punjab convener in 2017, with Arora as the co-convener. However, Mann resigned from the post the following year, only to be reappointed in 2019 and continued to hold dual charge even after he took over as the chief minister.“It is rarely seen that the president of a party offers to step down as Mann Saab did recently. We will function as a team to fulfil their expectations,” Arora told media persons.In a press statement, the AAP said the appointments reflected AAP’s commitment to strengthening its leadership in Punjab and preparing for future electoral challenges.","Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Friday named cabinet minister Aman Arora as the state unit president, replacing chief minister Bhagwant Mann.
