‘Protecting Rohingyas And Bangladeshis’: BJP MP Sambit Patra Slams Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee

JALPAIGURI/KOLKATA: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee Saturday made a fervent appeal to Chief Justice of India (CJI) Surya Kant to safeguard democracy and ensure that investigative agencies do not defame citizens.""Our safety, security, history, geography, and boundaries must all be protected. The media should not conduct trials before cases are finalised... We are under your custody. You are the guardians of the Constitution,"" Mamata told the CJI during the inauguration of Jalpaiguri circuit bench of Calcutta high court.CJI Kant appreciated the vision of Calcutta high court and the state govt in setting up a circuit bench in Jalpaiguri in 2019, noting that before its establishment, people from the region had to travel nearly 600 km to Kolkata in pursuit of justice. ""Today, it has its own home. This building is designed as a sophisticated synthesis of tradition and 21st-century digital agility. It stands as a testament to judicial decentralisation,"" he said.Union law minister Arjun Ram Meghwal, who also attended the function, said Jalpaiguri circuit bench would be equipped with the latest technology, adding that ""justice should not just happen but should also be seen to happen."" He stressed the Centre's e-courts project, for which Rs 7,210 crore has been allocated in Phase III.","West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee Saturday made a fervent appeal to Chief Justice of India (CJI) Surya Kant.

PRAYAGRAJ: Allahabad high court has sought an explanation from a trial judge posted in Aligarh for allegedly citing a non-existent provision of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, while summoning an accused.In the order dated April 30, 2024, the then special judge, SC/ST Act, Aligarh, invoked ""Section 3(2)(5)"" of the SC/ST Act - a provision that does not exist in the statute, the counsel for the petitioner in the HC contended.The order was challenged by the accused in the case, Rajiv Bajaj, in the HC, which on Jan 14 sought an explanation from the special judge and fixed Jan 30 as the next date of hearing.Justice Praveen Kumar Giri at the HC, who passed the order, also said if any warrant had been issued against the applicant, it shall be kept in abeyance till then. The HC expressed serious concern over the manner in which judicial power was exercised, observing that such casual and careless orders had grave consequences for an individual's personal liberty.According to the applicant, he was falsely implicated in a case under SC/ST Act and the criminal proceedings were the outcome of a property dispute that arose after he was allotted a piece of land declared industrial by Uttar Pradesh State Industrial Development Corporation.The complainant had accused the applicant of assault and offences under the SC/ST Act, following which the judicial magistrate, Aligarh, directed the registration of an FIR.Pursuant to the magistrate's order, the police registered an FIR under relevant provisions of IPC and SC/ST Act and carried out an investigation, concluding that no prima facie case was made out against the accused. Dissatisfied with this outcome, the complainant filed a petition in the special court challenging the closure report.Thereafter, the special judge (SC/ST Act), Aligarh, treated the matter as a complaint case and proceeded to record the statements of the complainant and witnesses under Sections 200 and 202 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Subsequently, the special judge summoned the accused to face trial.","Allahabad high court has sought an explanation from a trial judge posted in Aligarh.

MUMBAI: As Maharashtra heads to elections on Thursday for 29 municipal corporations, all eyes are on Mumbai, where the BJP-led Mahayuti is locked in a battle with the united Thackeray front for control of the cash-rich Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).Polling for the 2,869 seats spread across 893 wards will begin at 7.30 am and conclude at 5.30 pm on January 15. A total of 3.48 crore voters are eligible to decide the fate of 15,931 candidates, including 1,700 in Mumbai and 1,166 in Pune. Counting of votes will take place on January 16.More than 25,000 police personnel, including senior officers, will be deployed across Mumbai to oversee elections to the BMC and vote counting. Except for Mumbai, the other 28 urban bodies have multi-member wards.This will be the Shiv Sena’s first BMC election since the 2022 split, when Eknath Shinde broke away with a majority of the party’s legislators, along with its name and symbol. The undivided Shiv Sena had held sway over the country’s richest civic body for 25 years.In a political turn ahead of the elections, estranged cousins Uddhav and Raj Thackeray reunited after two decades in their bid to consolidate Marathi votes, even as rival NCP factions forged a local alliance in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad.In this election, the Opposition Congress has asserted its presence in Mumbai by stepping out of the shadow of its Maha Vikas Aghadi allies — Shiv Sena (UBT) and Sharad Pawar's NCP (SP). The Congress has joined hands with Prakash Ambedkar’s Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) and the Rashtriya Samaj Paksh in the state capital, even as it contests independently in Nagpur.Elections to 29 municipal corporations are being held after a gap of over six years, with their terms having ended between 2020 and 2023. Of these, nine fall within the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), the most urbanised belt in India.The battlegrounds include Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, Navi Mumbai, Vasai-Virar, Kalyan-Dombivli, Kolhapur, Nagpur, Mumbai, Solapur, Amravati, Akola, Nashik, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Pune, Ulhasnagar, Thane, Chandrapur, Parbhani, Mira-Bhayandar, Nanded-Waghala, Panvel, Bhiwandi-Nizampur, Latur, Malegaon, Sangli-Miraj-Kupwad, Jalgaon, Ahilyanagar, Dhule, Jalna, and Ichalkaranji.Chief Minister Fadnavis, along with his deputies Eknath Shinde and Ajit Pawar, campaigned extensively across Maharashtra, while cousins Uddhav and Raj Thackeray concentrated their efforts on Mumbai, Thane, Nashik, and Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, where Uddhav held a rally. Telangana minister Mohammad Azharuddin, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi, and Tamil Nadu BJP leader K Annamalai were also among the star campaigners for the polls.Populist promises for women were the highlight of the manifestos of both the Mahayuti and the Shiv Sena (UBT)-MNS. The Mahayuti has promised a 50 per cent concession for women in BEST bus travel, while the Thackeray cousins have assured a Rs 1,500 monthly allowance for women domestic helps and a property tax waiver on houses up to 700 sq ft. The Congress manifesto, by contrast, prioritises combating Mumbai’s pollution, upgrading the BEST fleet, and strengthening the city’s financial health.The race for Mumbai’s mayoral post took centre stage in the campaign, with the BJP claiming that a Sena (UBT) victory could lead to a Muslim mayor, a charge the Uddhav Thackeray-led party countered by assuring voters of a Marathi mayor. CM Fadnavis also guaranteed that the mayor will be a ""Hindu and Marathi.""In the 227-ward Mumbai, the BJP is contesting 137 seats, the Shiv Sena 90, while the NCP is fighting separately on 94 seats. The Shiv Sena (UBT) has fielded 163 candidates, the MNS 52, the Congress 143 and the VBA 46. The Congress has fielded 1,263 candidates across the rest of the state.The Maharashtra State Election Commission on Friday announced that Thursday, January 15, will be a public holiday in areas falling under the 29 municipal corporations where polling will be held, an official said.The holiday will apply to government and semi-government offices, corporations, boards, public undertakings, banks, and central government offices within the jurisdiction of the civic bodies.The poll comission said administrative preparations, including readiness of EVMs, have been completed and urged the public to take an active part in the democratic exercise.","Elections to 29 municipal corporations are being held after a gap of over six years.

Mumbai And Pune Verdict Shake Thackeray And Pawar Dynasties As Legacy Politics Faces Reality Check







MUMBAI: The Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena dented the Sena (UBT)-MNS combine's tally but failed to beat the Thackerays in most Marathi-dominated areas across Mumbai. Contesting 90 seats, Shinde has won 29, so his strike rate turned out to be poorer than that of BJP. However, his party's seats are crucial to the BJP-Sena combine crossing the majority mark, and BJP cannot anoint a mayor in BMC without Shinde's support.The Shinde-led Sena went into BMC polls with 54 former corporators, but the numbers suggest many of them and their relatives lost this time. In fact, the kin of many of Shinde Sena's former and sitting MLAs and MPs were defeated.Despite fighting just 90 seats, Shinde's Sena was seeing 'family first' politics. Eight sitting and former MLAs/MPs had bagged tickets for family members. Former MP Rahul Shewale's sister-in-law Vaishali Nayan Shewale was fielded from ward 183 (Chembur), former MLA Sada Sarvankar's son Samadhan and daughter Priya were fielded from 194 and 191 (Worli, Mahim) respectively, while Jai Kudalkar, son of Kurla MLA Mangesh Kudalkar, was fielded from ward 169 (Kurla). Sena MP Ravindra Waikar's daughter Deepti Waikar-Potnis was given a nomination from ward 73 (Jogeshwari).They all lost.Similarly, Bhandup MLA Ashok Patil's son Rupesh Patil was given ticket from ward 113 (Bhandup). Former corporator Deepak Hande's wife Ashwini Hande has been given a ticket from ward 128 (Ghatkopar). They also lost to the Sena (UBT)-MNS combine.However, former MLA Yamini Jadhav, who lost the 2024 Lok Sabha and assembly polls and was also fighting the BMC polls. won from Byculla. Similarly, former Sena corporator Sanjay Turde's wife Meenal Turde was candidate from ward 166 (Kurla) and won. In Worli, wife of ex-Sena corporator Datta Narwankar, Vanita, won from ward 197 -- the only victorious Shinde Sena candidate from Worli.Sena Chandivli MLA Dilip Lande's wife Shaila Lande was a candidate from ward 163 (Chandivli) and got elected.Political observers said since the BMC polls this time were a multi-cornered contest, sitting MLAs and used their clout to 'accommodate' family members. As parties too could not find formidable candidates, netas extended their family quotas beyond the immediate family and even got tickets for in-laws and cousins. ""Usually, family tickets are given to immediate family like spouses and siblings, but this time since NCP was not in Mahayuti and Congress was not in MVA, there was a scramble for seats. Senior netas used this chance to flex muscle and get tickets for their kin. They managed to convince the party that there was no alternative. Parties too conceded as they didn't want to take any risk,"" a political observer said.",Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena dented the Sena (UBT)-MNS combine's tally.

Mumbai And Pune Verdict Shake Thackeray And Pawar Dynasties As Legacy Politics Faces Reality Check







MUMBAI: The Mahayuti alliance, led by the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) and Eknath Shinde ’s Shiv Sena , is storming ahead in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections, according to trends.With leads in over 110 wards across the city, the alliance appears on course to end the three-decade reign of the Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena.Meanwhile, the Shiv Sena (UBT) alliance struggles to cross 68, with MNS leading in just 9 seats, UBT Sena in 58, and the NCP (SP) barely holding one. Congress , too, faces a grim outlook, with leads in only 10 wards.High-profile battles are drawing attention. UBT’s Foram Parmar trails in Ward 1, while Gita Bhandari of the same faction is ahead in Ward 32.Shinde Sena’s Varsha Tembelkar is leading in Ward 51, and BJP candidates Deepak Tavde, Ujjwal Veti, and Neil Somaiya are showing strong leads.In Dharavi, Congress’ Asha Deepak Kale clinched Ward 183, offering a rare bright spot for the party.The political earthquake is not limited to Mumbai.In the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), BJP has displaced the Pawars, leading in 50 of 165 seats, while the two NCP factions trail with just 5 leads and the Congress-UBT alliance in 7.Official figures confirm BJP’s dominance with 47 leads, compared to 8 for NCP and 5 for Congress.Most exit polls had predicted a BJP-Shinde Sena wave, and preliminary trends suggest that the prediction is unfolding.If sustained, this result would mark the end of the 30-year incumbency of the Uddhav Thackeray-led outfit in India’s richest civic body.In majority of rallies, MNS chief Raj Thackeray called for Marathi unity, warning that the state’s language, land, and identity are under threat.He described the BMC elections as “decisive” for the Marathi community and urged voters to unite and remain vigilant to prevent malpractice.","The Mahayuti alliance, led by the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) and Eknath Shinde ’s Shiv Sena, is storming ahead in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections.
