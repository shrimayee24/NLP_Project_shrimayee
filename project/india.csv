"Shiv Sena: BJP and allies narrow down differences to about 12 seats, pledge to contain rebellions",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-and-allies-narrow-down-differences-to-about-12-seats-pledge-to-contain-rebellions/articleshow/114559523.cms,"PM Modi

NEW DELHI: Mahayuti allies in Maharashtra , after a marathon meeting with Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday, have narrowed down their differences on seat sharing to barely 12 seats, mainly in Mumbai and adjoining areas, and also took a joint pledge to stem rebellions and ensure compliance of the agreements reached among them to avoid ""friendly contests"".BJP, Shiv Sena (Shinde) and NCP (Ajit Pawar) decided to keep the decision on the 12 seats, essentially a bone of discord between BJP and Sena, hanging until close to the last day of filing papers so that those who might feel cheated don't bolt out.Sources said BJP might get to contest over 155 seats.Sena share may be in the 80-85 region, what is somewhat lower than the tally it had in mind. The rest of the seats would go to NCP (Ajit). The allies have so far released a list for 182 seats - BJP (99), Shiv Sena (45), and NCP (38) - but they are yet to announce nominees in the remaining 106 seats.After BJP released its first list of 99 candidates last Sunday, Sena workers opposed its candidates in at least four seats - Kalyan East, Thane, Navi Mumbai, and Murbad. It was learnt that state functionaries assured Shah of adherence to "" coalition dharma "" and stick to the formula on the basis of which seat-sharing arrangements have been made. They also assured no support to rebels.There was also an understanding, sources said, that controversial NCP leader Nawab Malik would not be fielded as BJP and Sena expressed discomfort in view of charges against him. His daughter Sana Malik , however, is likely to contest as an NCP nominee. Besides, there will not be any changes in the candidates announced so far.","BJP, Shiv Sena (Shinde) and NCP (Ajit Pawar) decided to keep the decision on the 12 seats, essentially a bone of discord between BJP and Sena, hanging until close to the last day of filing papers so that those who might feel cheated don't bolt out.

MUMBAI: A day after Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut declared that MVA partners Congress, NCP (SP) and UBT Sena would contest 85 seats each, a top Congress politician said that his party would contest 104 seats, while UBT Sena and NCP-SP would fight from 94 and 84 seats respectively.""The number of seats is not important, allotment of seats will be decided on merit and winnability.In my opinion, Congress will contest 100 to 104 seats, of which 43 will be from the Vidarbha region,"" said leader of opposition Vijay Wadettiwar .Referring to Raut's 85-85-85 formula, Wadettiwar said of the remaining 33 seats, two each would be allotted to PWP and SP, and three to CPM.Of the 26 seats that would remain after that, 18 will be allotted to Congress and 8 to UBT Sena. Congress politician said the 85-85-85 formula was declared in a hurry on Wednesday as several candidates were insisting on an official list so they would be able to file their nomination papers on Thursday, which was considered an auspicious day. Accordingly, several prominent candidates, including Aaditya Thackeray, state NCP (NCP) president Jayant Patil and former minister Harshawardhan Patil of NCP (SP) filed their nomination forms.Congress politician blamed the AICC leadership for inept handling of the political situation in the state, which has led to delay in finalising the seat-sharing formula. ""We had expected that AICC president Mallikarjun Kharge will meet both Sharad Pawar and Uddhav Thackeray, but no such steps were taken. We feel that after the humiliating defeat in Haryana, Congress has not taken Maharashtra assembly elections seriously, and lessons have not been learnt,"" he added.","MVA partners Congress, NCP (SP) and UBT Sena would contest 85 seats each.

NDA MPs call on Birla, lodge protest against Venugopal

NEW DELHI: Sebi chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch on Thursday cited ""personal exigencies"" to skip Parliament's Public Accounts Committee (PAC) meeting, which soon led to a fight between the panel's head K C Venugopal and NDA members who accused him of taking unilateral decisions and proceeded to lodge a protest with Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla.The committee's proceedings remained deadlocked even during its second sitting, where the Trai chairperson appeared briefly, amid NDA members' demand that Venugopal allow a vote on agenda items like summoning the heads of regulatory bodies, something that was opposed by MPs from Congress and its allies.Venugopal deferred the meet after Buch's no-show.The confrontation escalated when leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi and Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge joined in. ""Why is Madhabi Buch reluctant to answer questions... Who is behind the plan to protect her from being answerable to PAC?"" Rahul said on X.The PAC has constitutional right to summon any officer in connection with any govt investigation, Kharge posted.The feud over Buch started as soon as Congress-led opposition made public its intent to question the Sebi chief over allegations by Hindenburg that she did not conduct a thorough probe into “market manipulation” by Adani group, prime target of the short-seller, as well as her personal dealings involving “role conflict”. BJP opposed the plan by saying PAC’s mandate was limited to examining utilisation of funds by the market regulator and that Congress, through its MP K C Venugopal, was seeking to misuse the forum for partisan ends.Sources said Buch, in one of her communications to the PAC chairperson, referred to the Hindenburg issue and made some points. Some opposition members of the committee were left surprised as the panel has so far made no official mention of the contentious issue.On Thursday, Venugopal turned down the demand for taking a vote on summoning Buch by saying that there could not be any voting on subjects already approved by the committee, keeping open the possibility of calling Buch again, sources said.During the afternoon sitting, BJP member Nishikant Dubey cited parliamentary rules to move a motion to drop five of the 161 subjects selected by the committee for its annual agenda, and called for a vote. He said these subjects fell outside the PAC’s remit. With NDA members in majority in the panel, the chairperson did not allow the motion. He then called off the meeting amid protests by ruling alliance members. NDA members called on Birla and lodged a formal protest against Venugopal.As the panel met first at 11am, heated words were exchanged between the two sides. Venugopal read out from Buch’s letter amid the din and immediately postponed the proceedings.Venugopal indicated his disapproval of the Sebi chief skipping the meeting, noting that Buch had confirmed her presence after her earlier request for an exemption was denied. “Considering a woman’s request, we thought it better to postpone today’s meeting for another day,” he said.PAC member and BJP MP Ravi Shankar Prasad said there were many standing committees which reviewed performance of bodies such as Sebi, RBI & Trai: “Your (Venugopal) own words are ‘suo motu’. How did you decide? PAC’s job is to consider CAG reports. We have this information from reliable sources that CAG made no mention of Sebi. This conduct is unparliamentary. Conduct of the chairperson in the way he adjourned, did not allow us to speak... (he) walked out (which) shows he has extraneous political considerations.”Venugopal strongly rebutted the claim by showing committee reports on Sebi from the past. He showed two reports on Sebi from the 15th Lok Sabha when BJP’s Murli Manohar Joshi was PAC chairman, arguing that the reports were not on any CAG audit para. To BJP’s claims about unilateral agenda setting, Venugopal is said to have read out Parliament bulletins and also circulars, arguing the agenda was set by the members.","Sebi chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch cited ""personal exigencies"" to skip Parliament's Public Accounts Committee (PAC) meeting. This led to a fight between the panel's head K C Venugopal and NDA members who accused him of taking unilateral decisions.

The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections , which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases. The results will be declared on November 23, along with Maharashtra.In the Tribal-dominated state, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and CM Hemant's Soren Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) are in a direct fight, while the Congress party and Lalu Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) are in alliance with the JMM.The JMM-Congress-RJD alliance are also reportedly seeking to deal with Left parties, Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party and other tribal outfits that have been contesting the elections in the state as independent entities and make efforts to field candidates against the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) on all 81 seats collectively.In the last assembly polls in 2019, the JMM-Congress-RJD alliance won a comfortable majority of 47 seats in a House of 81.The BJP slipped to 25 seats from 37 it held in 2014. The poor performance was perceived to be the outcome of its decision to contest alone backfiring. The party did not foster an alliance with the Ajsu in the 2019 polls when Raghubar Das, currently the Odisha governor, was serving the state as CM.In this year's Lok Sabha polls in Jharkhand, the BJP-led NDA secured nine out of the 14 seats, with the BJP winning eight and its alliance partner, the Ajsu (All Jharkhand Students Union) Party, retaining its single seat.On the other hand, the opposition India bloc improved its tally, increasing its seat count from two in 2019 to five in the parliamentary polls.BJP and JMM have spruced up their pace of campaigning from the ground zero to social media. BJP and JMM leaders are actively rebutting and challenging each other on a range of issues, including illegal immigration, youth welfare, employment and housing.INDIA bloc parties in Jharkhand slammed the EC for holding assembly elections in the state along with that of Maharashtra but claimed that they were ready to slug it out with BJP-led NDA, which has welcomed the announcement of poll dates.JMM, Congress, and CPI (ML-L) said the announcement showed that EC was in a hurry to conduct elections though the assembly tenure was due to end in January next year.Also, both the INDIA bloc and BJP-led NDA are expected to get into huddles to discuss the modalities of seat-sharing which is going to be a challenge for both the competing teams.","The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections, which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra. Elections in Maharashtra will be held in single phase on November 20. The counting of votes will be on November 23.Maharashtra is gearing up for elections as the two major political alliances—the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) and the Mahayuti—prepare to face each other for the first time in a Vidhan Sabha election.The Maha Vikas Aghadi, comprise of the Congress, the Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray), and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) under Sharad Pawar, will go head-to-head with the Mahayuti , which includes the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Shiv Sena faction led by Eknath Shinde, and the NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar. This will be the first electoral contest between these two alliances since the splits within the Shiv Sena and NCP.The MVA is hopeful of replicating its recent Lok Sabha success, while the Mahayuti aims to retain power by leveraging its populist schemes targeted at women and youth. Both alliances have set their sights on winning the state.Narayan Rane, a former Union Minister and the victor in the Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg Lok Sabha constituency, is poised to be a key figure for the BJP in the Konkan region during the forthcoming elections. Meanwhile, two constituencies are expected to be critical battlegrounds: chief minister Eknath Shinde's Kopri-Pachpakdi seat in Thane City and Worli in Mumbai, where Aaditya Thackeray, a leader of the Shiv Sena (UBT), is seeking reelection.In the last Vidhan Sabha elections in 2019, the BJP secured 26.1% of the votes, the Congress 16.1%, the NCP 16.9%, and the Shiv Sena 16.6%. The BJP and the Shiv Sena (then united) formed the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which secured a majority. However, the coalition soon crumbled due to disagreements over government formation, plunging the state into a political crisis.After no party could establish a government, Maharashtra was placed under President's rule. Devendra Fadnavis was briefly sworn in as chief minister, with Ajit Pawar as deputy chief minister. However, both resigned just days later before a scheduled floor test.By November 28, 2019, a new coalition emerged, with the Shiv Sena (Uddhav faction), NCP (Sharad Pawar faction), and Congress forming the Maha Vikas Aghadi government, led by Uddhav Thackeray as chief minister.The state's politics took another turn in June, 2022, when Uddhav Thackeray resigned following a rebellion within the Shiv Sena, led by Eknath Shinde, who then allied with the BJP. Eknath Shinde assumed the role of chief minister, with Devendra Fadnavis returning as deputy chief minister.",The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra.
