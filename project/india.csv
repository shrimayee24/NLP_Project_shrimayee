"'I will raise your voice, you see in next session': Rahul Gandhi hints at another Parliament storm over Manipur",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/i-will-raise-your-voice-you-see-in-next-session-rahul-gandhi-hints-at-another-parliament-storm-over-manipur/articleshow/111664231.cms,"'PM's visit should not be made an issue'

NEW DELHI: The stage is set for another round of Parliament storm over Manipur. Leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi on Thursday made it clear that ""Congress and INDIA bloc will raise the Manipur issue with full force in Parliament.""Rahul, who recently made his third visit to the strife-torn state, reiterated that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should personally visit Manipur, listen to the problems of the people and appeal for peace.The former Congress chief, who met victims of violence in three relief camps, assured people that his party will raise the problems being faced by the people of Manipur in the upcoming session of Parliament.""We can put pressure (on the government) and we will put pressure on them. I can help you, I can raise the issue and put pressure but I can't reassure you when you will be able to go back to your homes because the government has the answer to this. You will see in the next session, I will raise your voice,"" Rahul is heard telling people in videos shared of his visit to a relief camp in Manipur.Parliament will reconvene on July 22 for the Budget session . The opposition has been relentless in its attacks on the government over its failure to end violence in Manipur. Their main target is Prime Minister Modi who has not visited the state since it plunged into violence on May 3 last year after ethnic clashes broke out between the Meiteis and the Kukis. Some 200 people have been killed till now while thousands have been displaced following large-scale arson that gutted homes and government buildings.In the just concluded Parliament session, the Prime Minister faced opposition sloganeering over Manipur situation right through his reply to the Motion of Thanks on the President's address. The Lok Sabha later adopted a motion moved by defence minister Rajnath Singh condemning the behaviour of opposition members and accusing them of violating parliamentary traditions. The Congress, however, justified the sloganeering blaming the government's unwillingness to give an MP from Manipur five minutes to speak before the PM's reply in Lok Sabha.While PM Modi did not mention Manipur in his speech in Lok Sabha, in Rajya Sabha he blamed the opposition for politicising a sensitive issue.""We are continuously trying to maintain peace and stability in Manipur. More than 11,000 FIRs have been registered, and more than 500 people have been arrested in Manipur, which is a very small state. Now, the incidents of violence are coming down. This means peace is possible,"" the PM said in his speech.""Both Central and state governments are actively working to resolve regional issues with patience and peace. Union Home Minister Amit Shah visited Manipur and stayed for weeks there, engaging with relevant stakeholders,"" he added.Manipur chief minister N Biren Singh , who has faced opposition flak for his failure to end violence, feels whether Prime Minister Narendra Modi visits the state or not should not be made an issue. ""We are keeping in touch with the PM round-the-clock and working under his guidance. All security-related, relief, and other works are being planned and performed as per the Prime Minister's advice and approval,"" the Manipur chief minister said countering the Congress's attacks on PM Modi.However, the Congress, which wrested two Lok Sabha seats of the state from the BJP, has made Modi's visit to the state a political issue and is unlikely to tone down its attack till the Prime Minister actually decides to visit the troubled northeast state. Rahul, who had visited Manipur weeks after ethnic violence and also began his 'Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra' from the state in January 2024, will continue to try and capitalise on the issue.(With inputs from agencies)","Rahul Gandhi: ""Congress and INDIA bloc will raise the Manipur issue with full force in Parliament"" The opposition has been relentless in its attacks on the government over its failure to end violence in Manipur. Prime Minister Modi has not visited the state since it plunged into violence on May 3 last year after ethnic clashes broke out.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111664404,imgsize-904893,width-400,resizemode-4/111664404.jpg"

When a person joins the Army, his parents or guardians’ names are recorded as NOK. When that cadet or officer gets married, under Army rules, the name of the person’s spouse is recorded as the person’s NOK instead of the parents.Captain’s father Ravi Pratap Singh and mother Manju Singh, in an interview to a TV channel, said they want change in NOK rules as their daughter-in-law Smriti Singh doesn’t live with them any more and she has changed her address (in office records) and that she now receives most entitlements after their son’s death.“The criteria set to NOK is not correct. I have also spoken to defence minister Rajnath Singh about this. Anshuman’s wife doesn’t live with us now, the marriage was just five months old and there is no child. Though we are the co-recipient of Kirti Chakra. We now just have a photo of our son hanging on the wall with a garland on it. We can’t place the Kriti Chakra on his photo as his wife took it away,” Singh said.Captain Anshuman’s father said some rules were changed after the 1999 Kargil War for the dead soldier’s dependents. Similarly, the NOK rules should be revisited. He also claimed that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has also assured them that he would take up the matter with the defence minister.Captain Singh’s mother said they want govt to revisit the NOK rules so that parents like them and dependents of the dead soldiers don’t have to suffer in future.",Captain’s wife Smriti Singh and mother Manju Singh recently received the Kirti Chakra.
