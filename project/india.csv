"No exemption, Bathinda court summons Kangana Ranaut on Oct 27 in defamation case",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/no-exemption-bathinda-court-summons-kangana-on-oct-27-in-defamation-case/articleshow/124219129.cms,"



BATHINDA: A local court on Monday issued fresh summons for actor-turned-politician Kangana Ranaut for Oct 27 in a defamation case after dismissing her application seeking permanent exemption from physical appearance.The Mandi MP failed to appear before the court, with her counsels seeking that she be allowed to appear through videoconferencing. The prosecution argued there was no provision for permanent exemption under CrPC, especially in the initial stages of the case. Prosecution counsel Raghbir Singh Behniwal said the court rejected the application and issued summons for Oct 27.The defamation case was filed by Mahinder Kaur, a 73-year-old farmer from Bahadurgarh Jandian village in Bathinda, in a Bathinda court on Jan 5, 2021. Protesting against the now-repealed three contentious farm laws, Kaur had alleged that the actor defamed her in a retweet she shared on Twitter (now X) by identifying her wrongly as Bilkis Bano of Shaheen Bagh fame.Recently, the Supreme Court refused to entertain Kangana's petition to quash the proceedings against her. This came after the Punjab and Haryana high court had dismissed her plea.The summons to appear before the Bathinda court on Monday were served by the police at the Mumbai residence of Kangana on Sept 23.Cops said a copy was pasted outside the residence of Kangana in Mumbai, another sent to Kangana's brother and also physically served to her private driver.Earlier, she was supposed to appear on Sept 15, but the summons were sent back unserved, with shortage of time and non-reservation of a train ticket to Mumbai cited as reasons.The court of judicial magistrate first class, Lakhbir Singh, during the hearing on Sept 15, mentioned that shortage of time or failure to reserve a train could not be accepted as valid grounds for non-service, issuing fresh summons for Monday.","The Mandi MP failed to appear before the court, with her counsels seeking that she be allowed to appear through videoconferencing.
