'Omar Abdullah stand on swearing-in will delay J&K's statehood': Engineer Rashid,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/omar-abdullah-stand-on-swearing-in-will-delay-jks-statehood-engineer-rashid/articleshow/114178141.cms,"What is your advice

to the CM-to-be

?

Would you now take a maximalist position to trap the Omar govt?

You are an elected MP but only on temporary bail?

AIP could win only one seat after all the hype.

There was a buzz around you because of your Lok Sabha win, but you fizzled out.

Did the allegations that you were a BJP proxy hurt your performance?

You won the Baramulla Lok Sabha elections from prison. Did the bail hurt you in the assembly elections?

Engineer Rashid’s AIP came a cropper after creating a buzz in J&K elections. But Rashid told TOI NC has started on a false note by not listening to his advice, which will hurt J&K in getting back statehoodI requested him ""don't take oath till statehood is restored"". Even Jammu region and BJP MLAs could not have opposed that stance.Nobody is taking away the MLAs. But Omar said Engineer is doing BJP's job. Is BJP silly to ask me to create issues for Omar that will bring a bad name to the Centre? Had he listened to me, we would have got statehood in 15 days. Now, I don't know how long we have to wait. He has missed the bus.I will support Omar on all steps he takes for the betterment of people. Had I wanted him to fail, I would have demanded he seek everything (from the Centre) in one day. My agenda is realistic.It is up to the people of India and the GoI. They must drop charges against me like they dropped the Public Safety charges against others. Let them respect the people's mandate. I drew crowds. If the PM told the world that people voted in large numbers in Kashmir, I also played a role in that. Please don't oppose my bail. I have taken oath under the Constitution and the media calls me anti-national.My party has been denied registration for seven years, and then a common symbol. We had 8-10 symbols for 34 candidates. So, I could not send a common message to people. I was released when the scrutiny for two phases of nominations was over. So, I could not make a proper selection of candidates. I knew only 2-3 candidates out of 34. It was a one-man show.Unfortunately, people came to know about me only after my release. But I became an MLA in 2008, I stood by my people. I had 4 lakh followers on social media. Anyway, AIP is the second largest force in Kashmir because we have an MP and an MLA, and a reasonable vote share in 30 odd seats.Here is a man who suffered for 5.5 years in jail, and they created a narrative to suit their politics. The verdict is out, and I am satisfied. People will see how Omar Abdullah will take things forward and he has already started taking U-turns. I was a single MLA but used to keep the entire govt and assembly on their toes on legitimate issues. I singlehandedly from 2008-18 forced Omar, Mufti, Mehbooba to respond to people's issues positively. Let them create perceptions. This is Kashmir. Keep on watching what happens in the future.No. People did not ever vote for me because they took mercy on me for being in jail. It was not a sympathy vote. I contested the LS polls in 2019 also and lost by 2,7000 votes. It was not a sympathy wave ever, but a vote for my unique model of governance.",Engineer Rashid's AIP came a cropper after creating a buzz in J&K elections.

BJP: ‘Rahul Gandhi bachao committee’: BJP takes dig at Congress' fact-finding committee over Haryana polls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rahul-gandhi-bachao-committee-bjp-takes-dig-at-congress-fact-finding-committee-over-haryana-polls/articleshow/114147192.cms,"File photo: BJP national spokesperson Shahzad Poonawalla (Picture credit: ANI)

As the results of the Haryana assembly election left Congress scratching its head, Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) on Friday took a jibe at the party's decision to make a committee to probe the poor show by calling it ' Rahul Gandhi bachao committee'.BJP national spokesperson Shahzad Poonawalla said that the aim of this committee was to not find facts but to ‘save’ Rahul Gandhi from the responsibility for the loss and blame someone else for the same.""This is less of a fact-finding committee and more of Rahul Gandhi bachao committee. The committee only aims to blame someone else for the defeat. Since Rahul Gandhi began the Bharat Jodo Yatra , they have lost 11 elections and won only two to three, that too with the help of crutches,"" ANI quoted Poonawalla as saying.Poonawalla further targeted the Congress leader by reminding his poor track record in fighting elections, which he said was 73 to 74 lost elections, also including the three Lok Sabha elections.""The main fact is that Rahul Gandhi almost lost 73 to 74 elections including three Lok Sabha elections. Despite that, Rahul Gandhi is sitting in the fact-finding committee and KC Venugopal 's ticket distribution is also being questioned. All of them are trying to blame Kumari Selja for the loss and she was not even called in the meeting that was held yesterday. We have also heard that the Congress has insulted the Dalits, and that is also a reason why they lost in Haryana,"" he said.According to Poonawalla, Rahul’s adoption of the ‘divide and rule’ policy to break the nation has not gone well with the people. Instead, the use of this policy has angered the public.""Rahul Gandhi adopted the divide and rule policy to break the country which has hurt and caused anger among the people. Can any committee take action on Rahul Gandhi now? Even the EVM has been balmed. In all states EVM is fine, but it only goes wrong in Haryana? The Congress party does not want to face the reality and have lost because of their arrogance and their disconnect with the people,"" Poonawalla added.Expressing their surprise at the poll results, Congress has described it as ""totally unexpected, completely surprising, counter-intuitive and against ground-reality and said ""it is not possible"" for the party ""to accept the results"".A party delegation also met the Election Commission over the issue on Wednesday.Congress won 37 seats, raising its tally from 31 in previous elections. Meanwhile, BJP bagged 48 seats and saw an increase of 8 seats from previous elections.","BJP national spokesperson Shahzad Poonawalla said that the aim of this committee was to not find facts but to'save' Rahul Gandhi from the responsibility for the loss and blame someone else for the same.

Faceoff over Dharavi project



Dusshera rallies addressed by CM Eknath Shinde and Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday set the tone for the impending Maharashtra assembly elections . The rival factions — Shiv Sena and Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray, or UBT) — hurled piercing jibes at one another, heating up the political atmosphere in the poll-bound state.In a scathing tirade directed at the ruling Mahayuti alliance, particularly at the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ), Uddhav Thackeray compared the saffron party to ""Kauravas"" (antagonist in the Hindu Epic Mahabharat).Uddhav Thackeray further claimed that BJP ""smacks of arrogance"" and that he parted ways with the party because he didn't believe ""in its version of Hindutva "".The Shiv Sena (UBT) chief also raked up the Shivaji statue collapse incident , alleging that the Maratha King's statue collapsed because the state government built it only for votes. He also promised that when voted to power, they would build Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj statues in every district of Maharashtra.""It (Mahayuti government) built the statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj only for votes and that statue collapsed, but I want to tell you and promise you that when we come to power, we will build a temple of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in every district of Maharashtra. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj is a vote bank for them, but for us he is God,"" Uddhav Thackeray said.Thackeray also lashed out at the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ( RSS ), BJP's ideological mentor, asking it to ""introspect"" if it ""agrees with today's 'hybrid' BJP"".Uddhav Thackery said: ""I respect RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, but I don't like his views. He is saying come together to save Hindutva, why didn't you or Modi save Hindutva in the last 10 years?""""BJP should be ashamed of calling itself Bharatiya, it no longer belongs to people"", Uddhav Thackeray, BJP's former ally, said during the Dusshera rally at Shivaji Park.Thackery also spoke on PM Modi visiting Chief Justice of India (CJI) DY Chandrachud's house for aarti on the occasion of the Ganesh festival.Without directly mentioning the Shiv Sena-split matter that is sub judice in the Supreme Court, Uddhav Thackeray said: I want to tell the CJI that if you want to make history then give the right decision. You are only speaking, not giving any decision. You do aarti with Narendra Modi it is fine but if you do not give any decision then everyone will lose faith in the judiciary. People believe only in judiciary and democracy.""Just a few kilometres away in Mumbai's Azad Maidan, chief minister Eknath Shinde addressed a Dusshera rally and spared no words to hurl vitriolic criticism at Uddhav Thackeray and his governance when he served as CM.Speaking on the spilt that he staged in the Shiv Sena, CM Eknath Shinde said ""he freed the party from those who betrayed Balasaheb Thackeray's ideals"".CM Shinde, took a potshot at Thackeray, saying people ""never liked Babu's leadership"" and that's why they ""bought his government down"".""Earlier Babu (Uddhav Thackeray) used to wake up, take a bath and go live on Facebook. People never liked Babu's leadership, that's why people brought down his government. Mahayuti government is going to be formed in Maharashtra. I thank the Prime Minister for giving Marathi the status of a classical language,"" CM Shinde said at the Dusshera rally he addressed.The Shiv Sena chief also spoke about the National Democratic Alliance's (NDA) Lok Sabha poll performance, claiming opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi's (MVA) Lok Sabha poll success in Maharashtra was ""accidental, not permanent""""Shiv Sena won seven seats in a direct fight against Sena (UBT) in Lok Sabha polls which shows we are real Shiv Sena,"" he said.

They sold Dharavi to Adani and the people of Dharavi are facing many problems. I assure all of you and promise you that when we come to power I will cancel this project of Adani in Dharavi,"" Uddhav said.In a counter-argument, CM Shidne said: ""Our government started the Dharavi project and I want to tell the people of Dharavi that no matter what the opposition says, our government is going to give you good houses.""","Shiv Sena and Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray, or UBT) hurled piercing jibes at one another, heating up the political atmosphere in the poll-bound state.
