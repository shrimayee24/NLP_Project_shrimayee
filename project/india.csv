NEW DELHI: People's Democratic Party chief Mehbooba Mufti pointed out the difference between a ""shortsighted politician & a true statesman"" by comparing the then PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee 's visit to Jammu and Kashmir in 2003 and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit on Monday.The comparison came in the context of PDP's discontentment with the Modi government's ""unilateral"" decision to abrogate Article 370 and reduce the status of the state to a Union territory.""Difference between a shortsighted politician & a true statesman. In 2003 then BJP PM Vajpayee during his visit to Srinagar showed great faith in Mufti sahab’s vision of peace with dignity even though PDP had a mere 16 MLAs. Today our CM despite 50 MLAs did everything to appease & normalise Delhi’s unilateral actions in August 2019 that cleaved & robbed J&K of its special status,"" Mufti said, sharing a video of Vajpayee's visit to the region.Interestingly, in the video, both J&K CM Omar Abdullah and then PM Vajpayee can be seen talking about the possibility of rain.""Today, you came here and see how the weather also supported you. There's not a single cloud in the sky today. It's cold outside but no absence of warmth in our hearts,"" Abdullah said as he welcomed PM Modi.Meanwhile, Vajpayee said: ""If Mufti sahab's commnad can stop the rain, then imagine how quickly he can improve the situation in Jammu and Kashmir,"" adding,We must protect democracy, humanity, and our Kashmiri identity.)Meanwhile, Iltija Mufti also took a jibe at change in Abdullah's behaviour towards Centre as she posted an old social media post of J&K CM criticising PM Modi last year.Abdullah thanked PM Modi for fulfilling his promise of conducting timely elections in the region while also urging the restoration of statehood. He praised PM Modi's presence at the inauguration of the strategic 6.5 km-long Z-Morh tunnel in Ganderbal, which will ensure year-round access to the Sonamarg tourist destination.","People's Democratic Party chief Mehbooba Mufti compared PM Narendra Modi's visit to Jammu and Kashmir in 2003 with that of then PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
