Mumbai e-bus crash: Police suspect bus driver may have 'deliberately' used vehicle as 'weapon',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mumbai-e-bus-crash-police-suspect-bus-driver-may-have-deliberately-used-vehicle-as-weapon/articleshow/116181711.cms,"NEW DELHI: Mumbai Police on Tuesday sought custody of a civic transport bus driver involved in a accident that killed seven people and injured 42 in Mumbai, arguing they need to investigate whether the act was ""deliberate"" and if the vehicle was used as a ""weapon.""The court granted the police's request, remanding the accused, Sanjay More (54), to custody until December 21.The fatal crash occurred on Monday night around 9:30 pm on SG Barve Marg in Kurla (West), when an out-of-control electric bus operated by the Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) undertaking ploughed into pedestrians and vehicles.The accident left four policemen, on duty at the scene, injured and damaged 22 vehicles.Locals apprehended Sanjay More after the crash and handed him over to the police after thrashing him. He was subsequently arrested and booked under Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) sections, including culpable homicide not amounting to murder, voluntarily causing hurt using dangerous weapons, and endangering public safety.The police, in court, stressed the need to determine if the accused intended to commit the crime and whether a conspiracy was involved. They also highlighted the necessity to investigate More’s qualifications, including his training to operate electric buses and whether he was under the influence of narcotics.Opposing the remand plea, More’s lawyer, Samadhan Sulane, argued that the accident could have resulted from a ""technical fault"" in the bus and emphasized the administration’s responsibility to ensure the vehicle’s roadworthiness.According to police, More had no prior experience driving electric vehicles and had undergone only a ten-day training before starting to operate BEST’s electric buses from December 1.Initial interrogation revealed More was mentally alert, and primary medical reports indicated he was not under the influence of alcohol.The ill-fated 12-metre-long bus, manufactured by Hyderabad-based Olectra Greentech, is under examination by forensic experts and transport officers to rule out mechanical failure as a cause of the accident.The injured are receiving treatment at various municipal hospitals, with some in critical condition. Meanwhile, BEST has formed a committee led by Chief Manager (Transport) Ramesh Madavi to probe the incident.BEST officials reported that the bus’s speed accelerated uncontrollably during the accident. The vehicle was removed from the scene early Tuesday and taken to the Kurla depot for further inspection.Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis expressed sorrow over the tragedy, announcing Rs 5 lakh compensation for the deceased's kin and coverage of medical expenses for the injured by BMC and BEST. ""We stand with the families of those who lost their lives in this unfortunate incident. I pray for the speedy recovery of the injured,"" Fadnavis stated on X.The BJP also called on BEST General Manager Anil Diggikar, demanding Rs 10 lakh compensation for the deceased's families and Rs 50,000 to Rs 2 lakh for the injured.","Mumbai Police seek custody of civic transport bus driver involved in accident that killed seven people.

NEW DELHI: Does shouting 'Jai Shri Ram' inside a mosque hurt religious sentiments of Muslims? Supreme Court on Friday will hear a petition challenging a Karnataka HC decision which quashed criminal proceedings against miscreants who raised the slogan inside a mosque on the ground that it did not hurt religious sentiments.A bench of Justices Pankaj Mithal and Sandeep Mehta will hear the petition by Haydhar Ali, filed through advocate Javedur Rehman, who has challenged the HC's Sept 13 verdict quashing the entire criminal proceedings before a Puttur court in Dakshina Kannada district of Karnataka even before the police completed its investigation.It was alleged that on Sept 24, 2023, some miscreants entered the Badriya Juma Masjid at Aithoor village and started shouting 'Jai Shri Ram' slogans, followed by threats that Muslims would not be allowed to live in peace. The petitioner had lodged a complaint with police leading to the arrest of two persons, who were later granted bail.HC had stayed the proceedings before the trial court on Nov 29 last year on the plea of the accused seeking quashing of the criminal proceedings and granted the relief on Sep 13 this year. The petitioner said HC erred in quashing the proceedings as the investigation had not been completed by police for the full range of evidence to come before the court. It said trespass was a defined criminal offence.Raising of the 'Jai Shri Ram' slogans inside a mosque could be categorised as statements likely to cause communal trouble, which too is a defined offence as per the country's laws, it added.""The fact that such an incident took place inside a mosque, coupled with the threat to the lives of Muslims, HC should have allowed police to complete the investigation into the matter without first passing an interim order,"" the petitioner said.","Supreme Court will hear a petition challenging a Karnataka HC decision which quashed criminal proceedings against miscreants who raised the slogan inside a mosque.

SHIMLA: Taking serious note of the botched up probe, “biased” and “brazen conduct” of the Kullu police, the Himachal Pradesh high court on Thursday handed over the investigation into the suspicious death of a Haryana student, Vaibhav Yadav , on December 9, 2023 at a guest house in Tosh village of Kullu district, to the CBI A division bench, comprising Acting Chief Justice Tarlok Singh Chauhan and Justice Satyen Vaidya, said, “The facts of instant case thus demonstrate yet another brazen conduct of a public institution which shockingly has contributed to the already shrunk public trust.”The bench directed principal secretary (home) to conduct an inquiry into the conduct of all concerned police officials, particularly with re spect to violation of the Supreme Court’s directions regarding the police investigation in landmark ‘Lalita Kumari’ case and report the compliance on March 3, 2025. The court directed the superintendent of police, CBI Shimla, to immediately register an FIR and take the investigation to its logical conclusion. Himachal Pradesh DGP has been directed to ensure that the case record is handed over to the CBI within three days.“The instant case not only painfully reflects dereliction of duties by the police officials but also flagrant violation of mandate of law. In result, the casualty is not only the fundamental rights of the victim but the entire edifice of trust which the public institutions are mandated to behold,” underlined the division bench.The court was shocked to know about the police inaction in not registering an FIR in this case on Dec 9, 2023, and commented that the Kullu police surprisingly did not register any FIR till date even after the complaint by the deceased’s father.“We have already high lighted the strong evidence indicating gross portrayal of inadequacy by the state police. The conduct displayed by the police prima facie can also not be said to be unbiased. There were allegations against the senior police officials,” said the court.The division bench pointed out that once, on February 14 this year, the deceased’s father had shown his apprehension that his son had been murdered, the police were in possession of information about happening of cognizable offence and thus nothing more was required to register the FIR.The division bench said that it was the duty of the police to have arrived at a just conclusion after fair investigation, which they have “miserably failed.”Four students from Haryana Vaibhav Yadav, Kushagra, Shashank Sharma and Ritika Mittal visited Tosh village in Kullu district on Dec 9, 2023. Yadav died on the same evening, raising suspicion. Deceased Yadav’s post-mortem report says, “The deceased died due to gross subarachnoid haemorrhage secondary to the blunt trauma sustained to the head region. The injuries suffered on the body were consistent with the fall from height. Cannabinoids were detected in the chemical examination of samples preserved as per reports received from RFSL Mandi.”","The Himachal Pradesh high court handed over the investigation into the suspicious death of a Haryana student, Vaibhav Yadav, on December 9, 2023.

You have not been active as Punjab BJP chief and staying away from the upcoming civic polls in the state as well.

You are not participating in party meetings but continue to remain the state BJP chief. Can you elaborate?

What exactly made you step down?

Isn’t the BJP high command seized about Punjab issues?

Continuing to remain the Punjab BJP chief despite telling the party high command to relieve him from the post after the 2024 Lok Sabha elections in which BJP could not win even a single seat of the 13 seats, Sunil Jakhar tells Navjeevan Gopal that nothing much should be read into it, calling it a non-issue even as he asserts that Punjab has earned over the centuries its right to be treated in a special mannerYour comments I have asked the party high command to relieve me of my duties due to some personal and policy issues. So, I am not attending any party meetings. I was not available for the byelections to the four assembly seats as well. Immediately after the parliamentary elections, I had told the party high command to relieve me. I am not available for the party work, so I have excused myself.I think nothing much should be read into this. Everyone is making some vague guesses, but I think this is not an issue at all. The membership drive of the party is going on. And not only the state president, but the national president is also chosen by new members. So, I think they ( BJP high command ) are waiting for that process to be over. It is likely to be complete by the end of Dec or beginning of Jan and everything will be settled.There were many issues. First of all, it was my moral responsibility. We did not win a single seat in Punjab in Lok Sabha polls. So, I put in my papers. I had indicated (to resign) even before, but did not step aside because elections were due in a couple of months. I had informed them even prior to the elections that I may not be available after the parliamentary elections. When we did not win any seats, it was more of my moral responsibility and obligation to ask them to put somebody else on the job.Every state has its own issues and Punjab cannot be equated with any other state. For instance, some approaches may have worked in other states but may not bear results in Punjab. Everybody has their own opinion. That’s it. I have my opinion. There are others in the party here who have a different opinion. People sitting in the Centre look at it from a different perspective. So, I think somewhere along the line maybe I am wrong. I don’t claim to be the last word on the issues of Punjab. I have no such illusions about my ability. But yes, I could not perform and could not tackle those issues. That’s why I think it was only right for me to step aside and let somebody else take over.They are very serious about Punjab. They have their own approach. All I am saying is that I have a different approach. Punjab is not only a border state, but it has also earned itself a right to claim special attention and special treatment. Punjab has earned over the centuries its right to be treated in a special manner different from any other state. Approach to Punjab has to be looked into with a different perspectivethan any other. And I think the Central govt is aware of it. And I’m very sure that soon, very soon, BJP will be in a position to provide an alternative to the people of Punjab where they can expect the state to flourish once again.","Sunil Jakhar has not been active as Punjab BJP chief and staying away from the upcoming civic polls in the state as well.
