NEW DELHI: SC on Monday sought the Centre’s response to a suggestion for allowing Sonali, a pregnant woman who was deported to Bangladesh for allegedly being a citizen of the neighbouring country, and her 5-year-old son to return to India and getting her admitted to hospital.Responding to a plea by Sanjay Hegde, counsel for Sonali’s father, that the woman needs to be home because of her advanced pregnancy, a bench led by CJI Surya Kant asked solicitor general Tushar Mehta whether she could be allowed to come back with her minor son. They are presently detained at Chapainawabganj in Bangladesh.Hegde said the place of detention is just 40 km from Indo-Bangladesh border and that she and her son could come to the nearby border checkpoint for entry into West Bengal. SC told SG that on humanitarian grounds, she and her son could be allowed entry. “You can admit her to a hospital and keep watch on her,” the bench said.Mehta said he would get back with Centre’s response on Wednesday. Sonali, her husband Danish Sekh and their son were detained by Delhi Police in June on suspicion of being illegal Bangladeshi migrants and were later deported to Bangladesh.The Calcutta HC had called the deportation illegal and directed the Union govt to bring the family back in four weeks. Centre has appealed against HC order before SC.","Sonali, her husband Danish Sekh and their son were detained by Delhi Police in June on suspicion of being illegal Bangladeshi migrants.

TOI

CHENNAI: BJP has reached out to AMMK general secretary T T V Dhinakaran, requesting him to put on hold his drift towards actor-politician Vijay’s TVK. Though Dhinakaran remains firm that he will not return to NDA unless AIADMK general secretary Edappadi K Palaniswami is replaced as its chief ministerial candidate, BJP hopes to convince him to join the NDA.BJP sources toldthat their senior leaders contacted Dhinakaran and asked to him not to rush into a TVK alliance. Dhinakaran was told that BJP’s leaders from Delhi would soon hold direct talks with him to explore a possible resolution. BJP leaders said Union home minister Amit Shah is likely to visit Tamil Nadu later this month to strengthen NDA’s alliance framework in the state. “TTV is a valuable political asset to improve our strike rate and unseat DMK govt in 2026,” said a senior BJP functionary from western TN, BJP is yet to arrive at an offer that could bring about a change of mind in Dhinakaran, but hope Shah would be able to convince him.For BJP, retaining AMMK is an electoral priority. The party values Dhinakaran as in 2021, AMMK secured around 30,000 votes in more than 20 constituencies in south TN and more than 10,000 votes in others. These numbers could prove decisive in a closely contested election.AMMK functionaries confirmed BJP’s reachout. “A senior BJP leader was in touch with our leader and asked him not to announce any tie-up with TVK hurriedly,” said a former MLA close to Dhinakaran.Despite the outreach, Dhinakaran has been firm on removing EPS as CM candidate. Toughening his position, he invited applications from AMMK functionaries aspiring to contest in 2026 assembly polls in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry on Monday. “The application is available between Dec 10 and 18, and Jan 3 is the last day to submit the filled forms”, he said in a statement.On Monday too Dhinakaran attacked EPS, saying people would script his end in 2026. He told reporters in Madurai that several parties had invited AMMK to join their fronts. “Once discussions conclude, we will make an announcement. There is no hurry,” he said.",BJP sources toldthat their senior leaders contacted Dhinakaran and asked to him not to rush into a TVK alliance.
