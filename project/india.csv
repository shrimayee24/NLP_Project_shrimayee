BJP Blasts Cong For Bengaluru Stampede, CM Siddaramaiah Gives 'Kumbh' Reference | RCB | Karnataka

MYSURU/BENGALURU: Chief minister Siddaramaiah on Sunday sought to distance his govt from the 11 deaths in a stampede outside M Chinnaswamy Stadium during RCB's IPL win celebrations on June 4, saying he had okayed only the state-organised event at Vidhana Soudha where nothing untoward happened.Blaming suspended police commissioner B Dayananda, he said he was informed about the stampede at 5.45pm, almost two hours after it occurred.The CM's statements came as opposition BJP demanded a three-day special legislative session to discuss the stampede. The party also plans to meet governor Thaawarchand Gehlot and President Droupadi Murmu to seek dismissal of the Congress-led govt.Talking to reporters in Mysuru, Siddaramaiah pushed back, saying, ""Govt has done nothing wrong. Where did it happen? At the stadium. Did anything untoward happen at Vidhana Soudha? All those responsible have been suspended or taken into custody."" Four people, including an RCB top executive, have been arrested so far.The CM denied any embarrassment to his govt, though he admitted being pained. ""Such a tragedy has never occurred on my watch,"" he said, blaming RCB, Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA), and Bengaluru police for mismanaging crowd control and communication.Siddaramaiah said he was informed of the stampede only at 5.45pm. Crowds had begun to gather at Vidhana Soudha and the stadium through the afternoon and a stampede broke out . The CM said the deaths were reported at the hospital at 3.50pm. ""I'm the head of govt. Bengaluru police commissioner B Dayananda should have informed me during the Vidhana Soudha celebrations. He didn't."" The team was felicitated at Vidhana Soudha, the state legislature, after which it moved to the stadium.The CM said Dayananda, political secretary Govindraju, and ADGP (intelligence) Hemant Nimbalkar have been removed from their posts. He defended senior bureaucrats, saying chief secretary Shalini Rajneesh approved the event after police assured adequate security. The CM insisted KSCA led the Vidhana Soudha event and formally invited him. ""They told me even governor Gehlot was attending. I wasn't invited to the stadium,"" he said.BJP accused govt of ignoring security warnings and breaching norms. R Ashoka and Chaluvadi Narayanswamy - BJP's leader of opposition in the assembly and legislative council, respectively - said the party would formally write to Siddaramaiah, assembly speaker UT Khader, and council chairman Basavaraj Horatti to demand the session.Ashoka cited letters from Vidhana Soudha DCP MN Karibasavana Gowda and PWD officials warning against hosting a large crowd at the assembly complex. ""The DCP asked for CCTV cameras and an anti-drone system. None were installed,"" the BJP functionary said. He said the PWD limited the stage to 60x20ft with 25 seats, but over 200 people were present, including the CM's grandson.Ashoka said 95 BJP MLAs, including Horatti, would donate a month's salary each to compensate the 11 victims' families.",Chief minister Siddaramaiah sought to distance his govt from the 11 deaths in a stampede outside M Chinnaswamy Stadium during RCB's IPL win celebrations on June 4.

THANE: Shiv Sena leader and Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Eknath Shinde sharply criticised the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) and warned that if the opposition continues to attack the Mahayuti alliance, voters will show them their place in the upcoming civic elections.Responding to Congress Chief Rahul Gandhi’s allegations of rigging in Maharashtra’s assembly polls, Shinde, in Thane for the induction of former MLA Bhanudas Murkute and supporters from Ahilyanagar’s Shrirampur, said, “The Congress and MVA quietly accepted their majority in the Parliament polls but started protesting only after losing state elections. They praise the process when winning but call it rigged when losing. BJP won in 21 states—is the process rigged everywhere? This insults voters who will retaliate in upcoming polls. This is just the trailer; the real verdict will come in civic elections. Currently, MVA can’t even form a proper opposition due to low numbers.”Shinde highlighted Narendra Modi’s 11 years of development compared to Congress’s tenure. “Congress never eradicated poverty, but Modi lifted 30 crore people out of poverty and launched numerous welfare schemes,” he said, accusing Congress of politicising issues.","Deputy Chief Minister Eknath Shinde criticised the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) for questioning the integrity of election processes after losses.

NEW DELHI: The Telangana cabinet led by Chief Minister Revanth Reddy saw its first expansion on Sunday, with three Congress MLAs, G Vivek Venkata Swamy, Adluri Laxman Kumar and Vakiti Srihari, sworn in as ministers at a ceremony held at Raj Bhavan in Hyderabad.Governor Jishnu Dev Varma administered the oath of office and secrecy in the presence of CM Reddy, cabinet members, MLAs and other dignitaries.According to news agency PTI, the induction followed a series of discussions between CM Revanth Reddy, Telangana Congress chief B Mahesh Kumar Goud, and the Congress high command in Delhi.With this move, the strength of the cabinet has now increased to 15, with three vacancies still remaining out of the permitted 18.The appointments were seen as a step towards reinforcing the Congress’s stated commitment to social justice. Vivek and Laxman Kumar belong to the SC (Mala) and SC (Madiga) communities respectively, while Srihari hails from the backwards classes. Additionally, Congress legislator Ramchander Naik, who was appointed Deputy Speaker of the Legislative Assembly, represents the Scheduled Tribes.Congratulating the newly inducted ministers and deputy speaker, CM Revanth Reddy wrote on X, “As new ministers about to take charge — Sri Vivek Venkata Swamy, Mr.Adluri Lakshman, and Sri Vakiti Srihari — my congratulations. To Shri Ramachandru Nayak, who is about to assume the charge of Deputy Speaker in the Legislative Assembly, my congratulations”.Vivek Venkata Swamy, a prominent face in the Congress and son of veteran leader G Venkataswamy, had previously served as a Lok Sabha MP from Peddapalli and was also the president of the Hyderabad Cricket Association.He rejoined the Congress ahead of the 2023 assembly polls after brief stints with the BRS and BJP.

‘Bihar First, Bihari First’: LJP Chief Chirag Paswan Ends Suspense, To Contest Bihar Assembly Polls

NEW DELHI: Union minister Chirag Paswan on Sunday claimed that Congress MP and leader of the opposition in Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi , has already conceded defeat in the upcoming Bihar Assembly elections , citing Gandhi’s recent remarks targeting the Election Commission of India (ECI).Speaking to reporters, Paswan accused Gandhi of deflecting blame and targeting constitutional bodies instead of holding his own party accountable.""The problem with Congress and its leaders is that when introspection is needed, they look for excuses for losing elections,"" Paswan said, as quoted by the news agency ANI. ""If Rahul Gandhi needs to find faults in any institution, it should not be a constitutional institution, but his own Congress party. Blaming the Election Commission, accusing someone of fixing elections, saying that the EVM is faulty, all this shows that Rahul Gandhi has already accepted defeat in the Bihar Assembly elections. ""Bihar will go to the polls later this year.Paswan further predicted that after Bihar, the opposition will suffer defeats in Assam and West Bengal as well.Meanwhile, RJD leader and Bihar’s leader of opposition, Tejashwi Yadav , came out in strong support of Gandhi. Speaking in Patna, Yadav accused the BJP of compromising constitutional institutions, claiming, ""Ever since Narendra Modi has become the Prime Minister, all constitutional institutions have been hijacked.Before the ECI announces the elections, the BJP IT Cell knows the schedule.""Tejashwi said the opposition’s efforts were not just about power. ""Everyone is working together, not to form the government, but to strengthen Bihar,"" he added, backing Gandhi's criticism of the ECI.Gandhi, who is the Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha, had on Saturday posted on X criticising the ECI’s response to his allegations of rigging in the 2024 Maharashtra Assembly elections. He wrote, “Dear EC, You are a Constitutional body. Releasing unsigned, evasive notes to intermediaries is not the way to respond to serious questions.”He urged the Commission to publish machine-readable electoral rolls and release all CCTV footage from polling booths post-5 pm to ensure transparency. “Evasion won't protect your credibility. Telling the truth will,” he wrote.The ECI later dismissed Gandhi’s remarks, calling his allegations ""unsubstantiated"" and an “affront to the rule of law.” The Commission said that all relevant facts had been shared with the Congress party in December 2024 and are publicly available.The poll panel warned that spreading misinformation disrespects the law and demotivates lakhs of honest poll workers. “After any unfavourable verdict by the voters, trying to defame the Election Commission... is completely absurd,” the Commission said in a detailed statement.In his op-ed titled Match-fixing Maharashtra, Gandhi had alleged that the state elections were a “blueprint for rigging democracy”, involving fake voters, inflated turnout, targeted bogus voting, and concealed evidence.","Union minister Chirag Paswan claims Rahul Gandhi has already conceded defeat in the upcoming Bihar Assembly elections.

'EC Acting Like Govt Stooge': Congress, TMC Blast Modi Govt After Rahul's Remarks, BJP Hits Back

NEW DELHI: Election Commission officials on Saturday slammed Leader of the Opposition Rahul Gandhi for accusing it of “fixing” Maharashtra polls, saying that the “absurd” allegations – already dismissed in a letter to the Congress dated Dec 24, 2024 – not only demotivate lakhs of govt staff who work untiringly to deliver transparent elections but also “bring into disrepute” party’s own representatives from the polling station to the constituency level.“Any misinformation being spread, by anyone, is a sign of disrespect towards the law, under which polls are held. After an unfavourable verdict by the voters, trying todefame the Election Commission by saying that it is compromised, is completely absurd,” an EC functionary told TOI.EC also found it strange that the LoP, instead of directly writing to the EC, has thus far chosen to air his grievances at various other forums – party meetings, Lok Sabha, even interactions on foreign soil and, now, an Op-Ed article. “If he is aggrieved, why is he shying from write to EC directly or seeking a meeting?” asked the functionary mentioned above.On Rahul faulting the appointment process of CEC and election commissioners, officials underlined that it was only under Modi govt that the law was amended to allow LoP a say in the appointments. “All CECs and election commissioners under previous Cong govts were appointed at the sole will of the Executive,” said an officer.Stating that Rahul, in his Op-ED article, has only harped on the allegations denied by the poll panel in December 2024, with additional clarifications published in TOI on April 22, EC officials rejected his charge of extraordinary surge in last two hours. It emphasised that over 6.4 crore electors in Maharashtra, who reached the polling station from 7 am to 6 pm on November 20, 2024, had voted. Thus, about 58 lakh votes were polled per hour on an average. “Going by these average trends, nearly 116 lakh voters could have voted in the last two hours. Therefore, casting of 65 lakh votes by electors in two hours is much below the average hourly voting trends,” an EC functionary pointed out.As regards the anomalies alleged by Rahul in roll revision, the functionary underlined that over 27,000 booth level agents (BLAs) appointed by the Congress were actively involved at every step of the summary revision of Maharashtra rolls ahead of the state polls, including raising claims and objections against the draft roll.Interestingly, while electors increased by 8.1% in Maharashtra since the last assembly poll, the corresponding rise was 13.4% for Jharkhand and 16.2% for Telangana. Congress won both Jharkhand (in alliance with JMM) and Telangana polls.Even after the final roll was published with a total 9.7 crore electors and its copies shared with all political parties including the Congress – allowing them to file two-point appeals, if dissatisfied – only 89 appeals were filed before the first appellate authority (district magistrate) and one before the second (chief electoral officer). “It is thus amply clear that there was no grievance of Congress or any other political party before the conduct of Maharashtra polls,” said the EC functionary.As regards allegations of irregularities in polling, EC officials shared that polling agents of all candidates and parties, including Congress, were present at the polling stations. “Congress’s nominated candidates or their authorized agents did not raise any substantiated allegations with regard to any kind of abnormal voting at the time of scrutiny before the returning officer and the election observers,” said an officer.“It appears that all these facts brought to the Congress notice by EC in its letter dated December 24, 2024, have completely been ignored,” said an EC functionary.","Election Commission officials slammed Leader of the Opposition Rahul Gandhi for accusing it of “fixing’ Maharashtra polls. “Any misinformation being spread, by anyone, is a sign of disrespect towards the law, under which polls are held.
