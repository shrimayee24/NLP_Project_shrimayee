"INDIA bloc ‘frayed’, says Chidambaram, calls for coordination",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-bloc-frayed-says-chidambaram-calls-for-coordination/articleshow/121220501.cms,"P Chidambaram (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Congress veteran P Chidambaram has expressed concern that opposition INDIA bloc was no longer intact while stressing that an alliance was required to take on the ‘formidable’ BJP machinery that “controls from Election Commission to the lowest police station” — echoing concerns among many players in the anti-BJP grouping amid growing dissonance and lack of active coordination.“If INDIA bloc is totally intact, I am very, very happy. But it shows at the seams that it is frayed. It can be put together, there is still time,” Chidambaram said at a function to release a book on 2024 elections , ‘Contesting Democratic Deficit’, by Congress’ Salman Khurshid and Mrityunjay Yadav.A gleeful BJP latched on to the comments to state that successive defeats had left Congress scarred. “Chidambaram used the word ‘formidable’ six times to describe BJP and its election machinery in a speech that lasted less than three minutes. Successive defeats have left Congress scarred, much like Pakistan after its bases were destroyed by the IAF,” BJP’s IT cell head Amit Malviya posted on X.Chidambaram’s remarks struck a chord with many politicians who have raised alarm that INDIA bloc has stopped having meetings and players like NCP of Sharad Pawar are seen to be toying with options outside. But the widespread lament in the bloc may not yield much result as electoral compulsions of partners are, in any case, likely to keep them away for many months. Four key allies — TMC, Congress, AAP and the Left parties — will be taking on each other in West Bengal, Kerala and Punjab in 2025 and 2026, and party leaders are loath to be seen together.That is the reason, sources said, the alliance partners have joined hands for coordination in Parliament but have not held meetings outside in recent months. In the most recent instance, Pawar has expressed disagreement with Congress’s demand for a special session of Parliament to discuss Operation Sindoor. TMC has not supported it either. However, Congress argues that alliances in key states are intact, citing examples of Bihar, Jharkhand, Kerala, UP, J&K, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra, which retains the INDIA flavour to a large extent.But Chidambaram’s alarm appeared to emphasise that the parties could not just cobble an alliance during LS polls and needed to strengthen it during the interim period. “In my reading of history, there has been no political party that has been so formidably organised as BJP. In every department, it is formidable. It’s not another political party. It’s a machine behind which is another machine. And, the two machines control all of the machinery of India — from ECI to the lowest police station in India. They are able to control and sometimes capture these institutions,” he said. “We are still an electoral democracy. We are not a full-fledged democracy no more, we are an electoral democracy ,” he added.",Congress veteran P Chidambaram has expressed concern that opposition INDIA bloc was no longer intact.

AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat High Court brought closure to a unique marital dispute after a man, battling for the custody of his wife, agreed - along with his family - to travel to her native village in Dungarpur, Rajasthan, and solemnise the marriage through traditional rituals.According to the case details, the couple already tied the knot in Ahmedabad three months ago and had registered their marriage legally with the marriage registrar at Dariapur on Feb 25. However, as both parties were from different castes, the bride's family refused to accept the union. The dispute reached Vadaj police station, where both parties reached a settlement. Both families agreed to a traditional wedding by performing all the rituals on April 19. The woman's family took her from the police station, and it was decided that the husband would go to his wife's native place at village Nandaliahara in Dungarpur district as the groom with a wedding party. All marriage rituals would be performed, and he could then bring his wife back to his home in Ahmedabad.As the man did not hear from his wife later, he approached the high court on April 14 urging it to reunite her with him. When the woman came to the court, she made it clear that she was willingly residing at her parental house and was ready to accompany her husband if a traditional marriage at her native place was held.The man's family expressed security concerns about going to Rajasthan for the rituals, but the woman's family remained adamant.Following the HC's intervention, the woman's father promised the court and the man's family that the groom and his family members would be welcomed and assured of their safety and security during their stay at Dungarpur.As the petitioner's family agreed to the traditional wedding party at Dungarpur, the HC disposed of the petition and said, ""In view of the aforesaid undertaking provided by the respondent No.4 (woman's father) with regards to the safety and security of the petitioner and his family members during their stay in Rajasthan, the present matter stands disposed of by recording that the corpus is not in any illegal confinement with her parents at Rajasthan and both sides are ready and willing to accept the petitioner and the corpus as legally wedded husband and wife.
