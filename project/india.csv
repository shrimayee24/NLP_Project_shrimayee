Narendra Modi Takes Oath As India's Prime Minister For Historic Third Consecutive Term

First session

NEW DELHI: A day after taking oath of office for a historic third consecutive term , Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday assigned portfolios to his 71 council of ministers .The new Union Cabinet held its first meeting at the PM's residence in the evening following which the full list of portfolios was released.Signalling continuity, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday retained four of his high-profile ministers Amit Shah, Rajnath Singh, Nirmala Sitharaman and S Jaishankar of Home, Defence, Finance and External Affairs respectively in his new government.The four ministers in charge of these portfolios make up the crucial Cabinet Committee on Security headed by the prime minister.Among new entrants to the Union Cabinet, former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has got Agriculture and Rural Development Ministries, while BJP president J P Nadda has returned to the Health Ministry, a portfolio he had held in the Modi government's first term before he took charge of the ruling BJP first as working president in 2019 and then as the full-fledged president in 2020.Among the five members of the BJP's allies in the Union Cabinet, JD(Secular)'s H D Kumaraswamy has got Heavy Industries, and Steel ministries, Jitan Ram Manjhi (HAM-Secular) has Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Ministry, and Lalan Singh (Janata Dal-United) Panchayati Raj, Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying Ministries.TDP's K Rammohan Naidu has got the Civil Aviation Ministry and LJP (Ram Vilas) leader Chirag Paswan has been allocated the Food Processing Industries Ministry.Among Ministers of State with Independent Charge, BJP ally and RLD leader Jayant Chaudhary has been allocated Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Ministry and Shiv Sena leader Jadhav Prataprao Ganpatrao will handle Ayush Ministry.The PM Modi 3.0 council of ministers include representation from all corners of the country as well as social groups.It has 27 ministers from Other Backward Classes, 10 from Scheduled Castes, 5 from Scheduled Tribes and 5 from minorities.A record 18 senior ministers will be heading ministries.Modi Cabinet 3.0 includes 43 ministers who have served 3 terms or higher in Parliament, with 39 having been ministers in central government before. The list includes multiple former chief ministers and 34 ministers who have served in state legislatures and 23 having worked as ministers in states.There are also 33 first-timers in the ranks. Seven first-time ministers in the Modi government belong to the allies: TDP's K Rammohan Naidu and Chandrasekhar Pemmasani; JDU's Lalan Singh and Ram Nath Thakur, RLD's Jayant Chaudhary, LJP's Chirag Paswan and HD Kumaraswamy of the JD(S).The new faces also include Suresh Gopi, the actor-turned-politician who scripted history by becoming the first BJP MP from Kerala.BJP's NDA partners have got five cabinet ministerial berths this time, as against none in the outgoing government, given the party's dependence on allies for a majority in the Lok Sabha. While the outgoing council of ministers had two ministers of state from BJP's allies -- Anupriya Patel of the Apna Dal (S) and Ramdas Athawale of the RPI(A) -- this time, there are two ministers of states with independent charge and four ministers of state (MoS).As per the Constitution of India, the total strength of the council of ministers cannot exceed 15% of the total number of Lok Sabha MPs.The strength of the 18th Lok Sabha is 543 members and hence the council of ministers cannot be more than 81.The 2024 Lok Sabha election results were announced by the Election Commission of India on June 4, the BJP won 240 seats and the Congress 99 seats. BJP had won 303 seats in the 2019 general elections and 282 seats in the 2014 general elections.The NDA's tally is 293 seats -- well above the majority mark of 272 -- and opposition INDIA bloc 234.As per media reports citing sources, the first session of the 18th Lok Sabha will begin from June 18 with President Droupadi Murmu expected to address a joint sitting of both Houses on June 21.The MPs in the Lower House are expected to take oaths on June 18-19, following which the Speaker will be elected on June 20.","Narendra Modi takes oath of office for third consecutive term as Prime Minister of India on Monday.

NEW DELHI: After NDA on Tuesday unanimously elected N Chandrababu Naidu as the chief ministerial candidate of Andhra Pradesh , the TDP supremo staked claim to form the government and will be taking oath on Wednesday. After a unanimous resolution was passed by all the MLAs of three alliance partners -- TDP, Janasena and BJP -- it was sent to governor Justice Abdul Nazeer who formally invited NDA to form the government.Meanwhile, Andhra Pradesh governor S Abdul Nazeer invited TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu to form the government.BJP leader Amit Shah has also left for Andhra Pradesh to hold a meeting with Naidu.The TDP chief also confirmed that Amaravati would be the capital of the state.NDA secured a huge majority in the Andhra assembly elections after securing 164 seats in the 175-member house. Of this, TDP secured 135, Janasena 21 and BJP 8.After taking charge as the home minister on Tuesday, Amit Shah is scheduled to travel to Andhra where he might meet CM-designate Chandrababu Naidu. According to the sources, Shah will hold a meeting with Naidu on Wednesday ahead of his oath-taking ceremony.The chief ministerial candidate met Andhra governor Abdul Nazeer and staked a claim to form the NDA government in the state.""There was an NDA meeting today in which Chandrababu Naidu was elected as the leader of the NDA Legislative Assembly. We have just come to the Governor and submitted a request letter to him that he should invite Chandrababu Naidu to form the government immediately, to which the Governor has responded and said that following the proper procedures, he will immediately call him to form the government,"" Naidu said.Daggubati Purandeswari, BJP state president, and Pawan Kalyan, the leader of the Janasena Party, accompanied Naidu.Addressing a meeting of TDP, BJP and Janasena legislators, Naidu confirmed that Amaravati would be the sole capital of Andhra Pradesh.""In our government, there will be no games under the guise of three capitals. Our capital is Amaravati. Amaravati is the capital,"" he said.During his tenure as Andhra Pradesh's chief minister from 2014 to 2019, Naidu had proposed Amaravati as the state's capital. However, the proposal took a blow as TDP lost and Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy-led YSRCP triumphed with a resounding victory.TDP supremo's name was suggested by Jana Sena chief Pawan Kalyan in the NDA meeting held earlier on Tuesday. He was then chosen as the CM face for Andhra. Pawan Kalyan stated that Andhra Pradesh needed Naidu's experience and vision.PM Modi is likely to be present at the swearing-in ceremony.Expressing gratitude towards the people of Andhra, Naidu said, ""With all your cooperation, I am swearing in tomorrow (as the CM) and I would like to thank you all for that.

Janasena chief Pawan Kalyan likely to be offered Andhra Pradesh deputy chief minister post: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/janasena-chief-pawan-kalyan-likely-to-be-offered-deputy-chief-minister-post/articleshow/110915899.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Janasena founder and actor Pawan Kalyan is expected to be offered the position of deputy chief minister in the upcoming N Chandrababu Naidu-led government in Andhra Pradesh. TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu is set to be sworn in as chief minister on Wednesday.According to PTI, sources within the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) said the new government is anticipated to allocate five to six ministerial positions to its allies, Janasena and the BJP . Alongside Pawan Kalyan, Nadendla Manohar, the chairman of Janasena's political affairs committee, is also likely to be included in the cabinet.Pawan Kalyan, who secured a win from the Pithapuram assembly constituency, began his political journey with his elder brother Chiranjeevi, who founded the Praja Rajyam party in 2008. Although Kalyan remained relatively inactive politically after his brother's party merged with Congress, he later established the Janasena party in 2014. While he did not contest the 2014 elections, Kalyan extended his support to the NDA alliance of TDP and BJP, which contributed to their victory.In the 2019 elections, Kalyan faced a significant defeat, losing all seats except one, the Razole assembly seat. However, in the 2024 polls, the 55-year-old actor-politician played a crucial role in forming the NDA alliance of TDP, BJP, and Janasena, leading to a resounding victory.During a recent NDA meeting in the national capital, Prime Minister Narendra Modi referred to Kalyan as ""Aandhi (storm),"" highlighting his influence and importance within the alliance.Additionally, TDP leader and Chandrababu Naidu's son, Nara Lokesh, and TDP Andhra Pradesh President K Atchannaidu are also expected to be sworn in alongside the chief minister designate. Nara Lokesh, 41, a former minister who previously managed the Information Technology Ministry of Andhra Pradesh from 2014 to 2019, is a Stanford MBA graduate and has experience working with the World Bank.Despite an initial setback in electoral politics in 2014, when he lost to YSRCP's A Ramakrishna Reddy in the Mangalagiri assembly constituency, Lokesh has gained favor with the electorate over the past five years. His statewide 'Yuva Galam' padayatra was instrumental in securing one of the largest victories in the 2024 polls, winning the Mangalagiri seat by a margin of over 90,000 votes.The BJP is slated to receive two positions in the Andhra Pradesh cabinet.The NDA alliance, consisting of TDP, BJP, and Janasena, achieved a landslide victory in the recent simultaneous Lok Sabha and Assembly elections in the state, securing a commanding majority of 164 assembly and 21 Lok Sabha seats.","Pawan Kalyan is expected to be offered the position of deputy chief minister.

"Modi 3.0 to revamp VIP security setup, may withdraw NSG, ITBP",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/modi-3-0-to-revamp-vip-security-setup-may-withdraw-nsg-itbp/articleshow/110905353.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Union government is likely to undertake a significant overhaul in the VIP security setup with the induction of new ministers, leading to the transfer of security duties for over a dozen high-risk individuals from the National Security Guard (NSG) and the Indo-Tibetan Border Police ( ITBP ) to other paramilitary forces.The ministry of home affairs will review the current list of allottees, which may result in the modification, reduction, or enhancement of security cover for various political figures, former ministers, retired bureaucrats, and others, PTI reported citing sources.One key change is the long-discussed plan to completely withdraw NSG 'black cat' commandos from VIP security duties, transferring all nine of their Z-plus category protectees to the Central Reserve Police Force ( CRPF ) VIP security unit.Additionally, some VIPs currently under the protection of ITBP personnel may be reassigned to either the CRPF or the VIP security wing of the Central Industrial Security Force ( CISF ), known as the Special Security Group (SSG).The list of individuals protected by the NSG includes Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, former Chief Minister and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) leader Mayawati, Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, senior BJP leader and former Deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani, Union Shipping Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, and former Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh. The NSG also secures former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister and Democratic Progressive Azad Party (DPAP) President Ghulam Nabi Azad, National Conference (NC) President Farooq Abdullah, and Telugu Desam Party (TDP) Chief N.

NEW DELHI: Congress and other opposition parties on Tuesday said PM Narendra Modi should pay heed to the ‘advice’ of RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat and visit Manipur which has seen violence for over a year now, a day after Bhagwat said the situation in the strife-torn state must be considered a priority.While Congress general secretarysaid Bhagwat can perhaps prevail upon the “former RSS officebearer” to go to the northeastern state, independent MP Kapil Sibal said it is “not in DNA” of the PM to listen to advice of opposition but he should pay attention to the words of the RSS chief.RJD functionary Tejashwi Yadav said Bhagwat has aired his concerns a bit too late and claimed that the Prime Minister has maintained “silence” on every crisis including Manipur.“The PM, on his part, has merely kept silent on every crisis, be it violence in that state, or protests by farmers and female wrestlers in Delhi,” he said.Manipur plunged into violence between the Meitei and Kuki communities in May last year. Since then some 200 people have been killed, while thousands have been displaced following large-scale arson that has gutted homes and govt buildings. Fresh violence has been reported from Jiribam over the past few days.Taking a swipe at the PM,Ramesh in a post on X said, “If not the ‘one-third’ PM’s conscience or the repeated demands of the people of Manipur, perhaps Mr Bhagwat can prevail upon the former RSS office-bearer to go to Manipur.”Former Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel said, “ Bhagwat is saying so based on his experience. He must have said about the arrogance that is visible. Bhagwat’s remarks on Manipur after a year show that the differences between BJP and RSS, which were highlighted by JP Nadda, are evident now.”Bhagwat on Monday expressed concern over peace eluding Manipur even after one year.Addressing a gathering of RSS trainees in Nagpur, Bhagwat said conflict in various places and in society is not good.Congress’ Gaurav Gogoi said he does not expect the prime minister to pay attention to Bhagwat’s words but people have chosen INDIA bloc to speak on their behalf.",RJD functionary Tejashwi Yadav said Bhagwat has aired his concerns a bit too late and claimed that the Prime Minister has maintained “silence” on every crisis including Manipur.

A decision on nominating a working president pending election of a full-time chief will be taken by the party brass. Though replacements have been smooth affairs, party circles and others will be watching whether it will be influenced by the desire for fresh reachouts to OBCs and women. With many prominent faces, including those with long spells in the organisation, joining govt, there is a possibility of someone from grassroots level, preferably a woman , a Dalit or an OBC , with strong RSS background, turning out to be the pick.The exercise has taken on an additional dimension because of speculation of view that RSS, always an important stakeholder, might take against background of its widely discussed estrangement from the party. Importantly, the outgoing chief’s remark where he said BJP had grown powerful enough to do without RSS’s support is said to have annoyed the Sangh leadership.His shift to govt notwithstanding, Nadda, whose three-year tenure got over in Jan and was extended by six months because of Lok Sabha polls, will continue as party president until the process to elect his successor is completed. Although there is no bar on a person simultaneously serving in the organisation and govt, adherence to one person-one post policy has been the convention. As per the party’s constitution, the national chief is elected by an electoral college consisting of members of national and state councils. Any 20 members of the electoral college of a state can propose any person who has been an active member for four terms and has 15 years of membership. The joint proposal, however, should come from not less than five states where elections have been completed for the national council. There is speculation that a woman could be elevated as the chief in view of the emphasis BJP has laid on women in the recent past with PM Narendra Modi acknowledging women voters’ decisive role in his three consecutive wins. No woman has headed the party so far.BJP is planning an extensive outreach campaign to increase the number of women members in the organisation — one of the main reasons why many see the next party chief being a woman a reasonable prospect. As per the women’s quota Act, 33% of seats in Lok Sabha and state assemblies will be reserved for women, which is likely by the next Lok Sabha polls in 2029. By then, the party will need strong bench strength to select potential candidates.",The process to elect his successor is likely in the next few days.

NEW DELHI: Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju on Tuesday said there was no need for the govt or the opposition to pull each other down on the basis of numerical strength and asserted that he will reach out to everyone for smooth functioning of Parliament.

Assuming charge as parliamentary affairs minister, Rijiju said the govt is yet to take a call on the dates of the first session of Parliament after constitution of the 18th Lok Sabha . ""The session dates are under discussion. I cannot share right now,"" Rijiju said.

He assumed charge in the presence of his predecessor Pralhad Joshi and ministers of state Arjun Ram Meghwal and L Murugan.

""People use muscle power outside Parliament, but inside the House, we should use vocal power for good debates,"" Rijiju said when asked about the increase in opposition's Lok Sabha strength.

Rijiju said people of the country were supreme and their decision reflected in the Lok Sabha elections results should be respected.

""Those entrusted with the responsibility to run the govt should do so, those tasked with the job of the opposition should discharge their duties,"" the four-term Lok Sabha member from Arunachal Pradesh said.

Rijiju appealed to all political parties to uphold the dignity of Parliament. ""I have come here on a positive note. We will make every effort to take everyone along and run Parliament,"" he said.

""I thank PM Modi for entrusting me with this huge responsibility. I, along with AR Meghwal and L Murugan, will ensure the PM's wish to run Parliament smoothly,"" he added.

On UCC, the minister was not very forthcoming but made it clear that it was part of BJP's poll manifesto.In keeping with directives from PM Narendra Modi, Meghwal signed off on the National Litigation Policy (NLP), which aims at bringing down pendency, on his first day in office.

Govt being the largest litigant in the country, a target was proposed for all departments to reduce cases and make it part of their results framework.It also provided for meeting of secretaries of respective departments, both at central and state levels, to review implementation of the policy. Law departments were to periodically convene meetings of nodal officers and weed out infructuous cases with fixed timelines.

RSS journal says poll results ‘reality check’ for ‘overconfident’ BJP netas,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rss-journal-says-poll-results-reality-check-for-overconfident-bjp-netas/articleshow/110920378.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Lok Sabha poll results have come as a reality check for “overconfident” BJP workers and many of its leaders as they were happy in their “bubble” and enjoying the glow of PM Modi’s aura but did not have their ear to the ground, RSS organ ‘Organiser’ said in an article in its latest edition.The write-up by RSS member Ratan Sharda, titled ‘Modi 3.0: Conversation for course correction’, came amid intense discussion on RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat’s speech on Monday in which he said a “true sevak has no ego (ahankar)”. Modi has consistently styled himself as the “pradhan sevak”. Sharda’s article said though RSS was not a “field force” of BJP, party leaders and workers failed to reach out to its ‘swayamsevaks’ (volunteers) for their cooperation in electoral work.Bhagwat had said: “He who is a real servant has no limitations. Everyone does the work. But it is important to follow the limits while working. We work with limits. The worker adheres to that limit. That limit is our religion and culture. One who follows limits does not engage in karma. He has no ego (ahankar). He is the true servant.”During the campaign, BJP chief J P Nadda had said in a media interview that the party had grown and could handle its own affairs and did not need RSS the way it did earlier.In his article, Sharda said, “Results of 2024 general elections have come as a reality check for overconfident BJP karyakartas and many leaders. They did not realise that PM Narendra Modi ji’s call of 400-plus (seats) was a target for them and a dare to the opposition.”Sharda, who has authored many books on RSS, noted that targets were achieved by hard work in the field, not by sharing posters and selfies on social media. “Since they were happy in their bubble, enjoying the glow reflected from Modi ji’s aura, they were not listening to voices on the streets,” he said.The idea that Modi was fighting on all 543 Lok Sabha seats had “limited value”, Sharda wrote. “This idea became self-defeating when candidates were changed, imposed at the cost of local leaders and defectors were given more importance. Sacrificing even well performing parliamentarians to accommodate latecomers hurt. It is estimated that around 25% of candidates were seasonal migrants,” he added.Sharda also flagged “unnecessary politicking” as a reason behind BJP’s underperformance. “Maharashtra is a prime example of unnecessary politicking and avoidable manipulations. NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar joined BJP though BJP and split Shiv Sena had a comfortable majority. BJP supporters were hurt because they had fought against this Congress ideology for years and were persecuted. In a single stroke, BJP reduced its brand value,” he said.On whether RSS worked for BJP in this election, Sharda said, “Let me say bluntly, RSS is not a field force of BJP. BJP has its own karyakartas. If BJP volunteers don’t reach out to RSS, they have to answer why they thought it was not required.”","The write-up by RSS member Ratan Sharda, titled ‘Modi 3.0: Conversation for course correction’, came amid intense discussion on RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat’s speech on Monday in which he said a “true sevak has no ego (ahankar)”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110920413,imgsize-25028,width-400,resizemode-4/110920413.jpg"

While the ministers and their staff were glued to television sets and kept checking websites for the ""communique"" from Rashtrapati Bhavan , the wait finally ended when they reached Lok Kalyan Marg for the first Cabinet meeting of the new govt.

Greeting them was an envelope on their seats, containing their portfolios as well as the names of the ministers of state attached to their ministries, sources told TOI.

During the previous two terms of PM Narendra Modi, the President's secretariat had issued the communique by afternoon but this time the wait was longer. And unlike 2014, when several portfolios had leaked out on the day of swearing-in, this time it wasn't until the Cabinet meeting that even the media got a whiff of it. As a result, names started being flashed on TV screens and websites after 6.30pm, when the Cabinet meeting ended.

Final list of ministers revealed at 7:30 pm

Govt watchers said that this may perhaps be the first time when ministers were informed about their portfolios written on paper and kept inside envelopes .

The final list of portfolios was made public only around 7.30 pm - this is when the ministers of state, including those holding independent charge, got to know their ministries.

In March, several BJP leaders and supporters added 'Modi ka Parivar ' to their social media bios in solidarity with the prime minister after RJD chief Lalu Prasad took a dig at him for having no family of his own and the latter responded by saying that he considered the entire country to be his family, something that was seen as aimed at drawing a contrast with the opposition INDIA bloc, which he had accused of being a collective of dynastic outfits.

""With the message of all of us being one family having been effectively conveyed, I would once again thank the people of India and request that you may now remove 'Modi ka Parivar' from your social media properties. The display name may change, but our bond as one parivar striving for India's progress remains strong and unbroken,"" the prime minister posted on X on Tuesday. ""Through the election campaign, people across India added 'Modi ka Parivar' to their social media as a mark of affection towards me. I derived a lot of strength from it. The people of India have given the NDA a majority for the third consecutive time, a record of sorts, and have given us the mandate to keep working for the betterment of our nation,"" he added.

The day also saw the 'PMO India' social media account using the photo of Modi bowing before a copy of the Constitution before he was elected leader of the NDA parliamentary party. The choice came amid an evolving consensus that Dalits and a few other categories were influenced by the opposition's allegation that BJP was seeking a 400-plus tally to scrap quotas by amending the Constitution. Modi and others in BJP refuted the charge, but the poll results show that the denials were not fully effective.

Reacting to Modi bowing before the Constitution, Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh said, ""This is the direct impact of Rahul Gandhi's single-minded focus on protection of the Constitution as the defining issue of the 2024 elections.""

Pappu pass ho gaya: How Rahul Gandhi and Congress changed the narrative,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pappu-pass-ho-gaya-how-rahul-gandhi-and-congress-changed-the-narrative/articleshow/110920033.cms,"Hitting the right note: Witty posts by INC Kerala’s X handle have garnered millions of views

With inputs from Nijeesh Narayanan

So how did a 'dynastic' party that was accused of having lost touch with reality, and led by a man dubbed 'pappu' and 'shehzaada', change the narrative around it? That's a question many are asking after the Congress turnaround in the recent Lok Sabha election.While people are crediting influencers, some of whom have millions of subscribers, it isn't as simple or unidimensional as that. Changing the perception of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi from that of a part-time politician to one holding and upholding the Constitution has been a giant leap that began with the Bharat Jodo Yatra (BJY) in September 2022.That leap was orchestrated by a dedicated war room, and savvy marketing professionals who knew how to use humour (the Congress Kerala handle on X is one great example) and a little drama (rolling out washing machines at rallies to wash BJP's alleged 'dirty laundry' in public.) Political consultant Sunil Kanugolu had used mock ATM machines that were fed fake currency notes to highlight corruption during the Telangana election last year.A panel headed by Ajay Maken and including experienced heads like KC Venugopal and Jairam Ramesh steered the ship in tandem with external teams from the party war room, as well as advertising and media agencies. They met daily initially, even thrice on some days, to ensure that the outreach machine kept humming. To quote a phrase Rahul Gandhi used often in the election, Congress counters came 'khatakhat, khatakhat'.Some of that behind-the-scenes work was handled by marketing and communications firm Teen Bandar, which was hired for BJY and its second leg Bharat Jodo Nyaya Yatra. The plan was to capture Gandhi walking the length of the country, holding impromptu discussions and chats, says Prashant Chari, co-founder of Teen Bandar. ""People did not believe that he would walk the whole day, for days on end. But through the daily release of multiple short snippets of his candid interactions and usage of pop culture, the yatra became immensely popular on social media,"" he says.The long beard and white T-shirt created an image of an atypical politician who was consumed by the journey rather than his looks. ""Gandhi appeared spontaneous, concerned and most of all sincere in his intentions towards the public,"" says a media professional.For the election campaign , DDB Mudra, Teen Bandar and other agencies created a mix of messages. Advertisements included a series of blogs and information videos attacking industrialists allegedly close to PM Narendra Modi, creating a counter-narrative to BJP's 'mangalsutra cheen lenge' charge, and emphasising its intentions to ""change"" the Constitution and end reservations for backward castes. The Ram temple issue was deliberately kept low-key.""The main tagline 'Haath Badlega Halaat' (Congress will change circumstances) took inspiration from the 2004 campaign 'Congress ka Haath, Aam Aadmi ke Saath',"" says a communications professional. While the 2004 slogan beat NDA's India Shining campaign and helped Congress sail to victory, this one didn't go as far but it did pave the way for a resurgent opposition. The main slogan was supplemented by ads like 'Mere Vikas Ka Do Hisaab' and 'Sab Theek Nahi Hai' that addressed issues of unemployment, inflation and corruption.It wasn't just a negative campaign. Positive messaging underlined the Congress 'panch nyay' or promises of a lakh a year to women under the Mahalakshmi scheme. Other guarantees include caste census and providing employment for youth.The change in perception was slow but steady. YouTube subscribers for Gandhi's page rose from 500k in 2021 to 7.2 million at present while followers on Instagram increased from 1.7 million to 9.4 million.""We made sure that we set the narrative by reaching out to people directly, without falling into our opponents' narrative,"" says Chari. It was not just about content, but timing too. A social media professional who was part of the party war room says, ""At the beginning of the year, four teams were created based on language and region and each had 900-1,000 interns whose job was to coordinate with local cadre and create WhatsApp groups for easy dissemination of messages.""Attack advertisements and statements by Congress leaders busting half-truths or responding to BJP attacks were quickly spread through this network.Another example of the nimble-footed response came when, after the election results, Congress' Kerala handle tweeted an image of TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu sitting with SP leader Akhilesh Yadav. The caption read, ""Don't panic Modiji, it's an old pic."" The post has been retweeted 9,400 times, attracting 4.2 million views in just a week.P Sarin, coordinator of digital campaign of Congress in Kerala, said the account did pan-India content rather than Kerala alone. ""We mainly focused on three things - myth busting, historical comparison, humorous presentation of facts. Verification of facts is a major factor, as social media platforms in India are polluted with fake news items and misleading messages,"" he says, adding that all social media accounts of INC Kerala would be active in the coming years to act as a good 'opposition' to Modi 3.0.","The Bharat Jodo Yatra (BJY) began in September 2022. The plan was to capture Gandhi walking the length of the country, holding impromptu discussions and chats.

"Ajit Pawar heaps praises on Sharad Pawar, also recalls Sonia Gandhi nationality row",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/ajit-heaps-praises-on-pawar-sr-also-recalls-sonia-nationality-row/articleshow/110883649.cms,"Ajit Pawar (centre) told party wokers that NCP would wait for a fresh offer for a ministerial slot but would continue with NDA. (PTI image)

MUMBAI: NCP president Ajit Pawar on Monday unexpectedly showered praise on his mentor and political rival Sharad Pawar at the foundation day celebrations of the party, saying the senior Pawar had played a crucial role in building it up.

“Sharad Pawar set up NCP 25 years ago over the nationality of Congress’s Sonia Gandhi. I am thankful to him for leading the party and providing powerful leadership to the organisation,’’ Ajit said.

Ajit’s statement lauding Pawar Sr is the first such since he dissociated himself from his uncle in June 2023 and comes days after the Lok Sabha poll results in which Sharad Pawar’s NCP won eight of the 10 seats it contested. Ajit’s party had contested four seats and won just one.

Ajit explained to party workers why NCP did not accept a minister of state post with independent charge in the new NDA govt. “Our contention that Praful Patel was a cabinet member in UPA govt for a prolonged period was not accepted. We informed the BJP leadership; we will wait for some time and will continue with NDA. Before Aug15, our strength in Rajya Sabha will increase from one to three,” he said.

The BJP leadership had told Ajit that the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena with a strength of seven members in LS too was offered a minister of state post with independent charge and it accepted the proposal.

Ajit made it clear that while NCP has joined hands with Sena and BJP, there is no change in the ideology of the party. “Our ideology remains the same, we follow the path shown by Shahu (Maharaj), Mahatma Phule and Dr Ambedkar,’’ he said.

On claims that the NDA govt will change the Constitution, Ajit said the opposition succeeded in creating a false narrative. “It was false propaganda… it appears that we were not able to counter it,” he said.

","Ajit Pawar said NCP would wait for a fresh offer for a ministerial slot. NCP did not accept a minister of state post with independent charge in the new NDA govt. Ajit made it clear that while NCP has joined hands with Sena and BJP, there is no change in the ideology of the party.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110883650,imgsize-60902,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/110883650.jpg"
BJP Governance: BJP's Strategic Response to Lok Sabha Poll Defeat: Countering the SP-Congress Alliance in UP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/bjps-focus-on-governance-organisational-reshuffle/articleshow/110887114.cms,"LUCKNOW: Unwilling to be weighed down by the Lok Sabha poll debacle in UP, the BJP is learnt to have decided to work on a two-pronged strategy: bolstering governance at the ground level and necessitating changes in the organisation to make it sharper and more aggressive to take on an assertive opposition, primarily the Samajwadi Party-Congress combine.Highly placed sources in the BJP said that the party brass was categorically against pressing the panic button in what could relay signals of distress within the party.A senior BJP leader said that the party’s top priority was an efficacious implementation of the 100 days agenda set out by the Narendra Modi-3.0 govt at the Centre and ground level execution of schemes and projects of the Yogi Adityanath govt in the state.In fact, CM Yogi himself initiated the process last week itself by convening a meeting of ministers and officials asking them to hit the ground running and put execution of developmental projects high on schedule.“The task has been cut clearly for us. We need to connect with people more effectively through governance,” a senior BJP leader said, stressing on the need of augmenting the coordination between the party organisation and the govt.Sources said that the efficacy of various ministers in the Yogi govt was also being closely assessed. A BJP leader said that a host of senior ministers, who failed to make any impact in the constituencies for which they were specifically deputed, too were under the lenses of the saffron command.The BJP also planned to recalibrate its organisational strategy and adjust it to the changed political scenario.Sources do not rule out organisational changes which were also on the cards with BJP national president JP Nadda getting inducted in the Modi-3.0 cabinet.Nadda’s tenure as BJP president is set to expire later this month. BJP sources said that necessary organisational changes may then be made accordingly as per the new party boss.As a matter of fact, it was only last year when the UP BJP made changes in the district and the regional level – more than a year after former UP minister Bhupendra Chaudhary, a Jat, took over as the state unit chief -- a move that swung the spotlight on BJP’s emphasis on Jat, the electorally significant community in the west UP region.Sources said that the party was expected to go in for certain changes at the ground level in the wake of “far below-expectation” results in the Lok Sabha elections. “The party will soon conduct a threadbare review of its performance to zero down on the reasons behind the loss in so many seats and a drastic fall in the vote share,” said a top BJP leader, affirming that certain changes may certainly be made within the organisation.The BJP also plans to re-assess the footprints of its allies in UP. For instance, Arvind Rajbhar of SBSP, an ally of BJP, was defeated in Ghosi by SP’s Rajeev Rai by a margin of over 1.60 lakh votes. The loss caused much discomfiture to the saffron ranks, less than a year after the BJP lost Ghosi by polls, which were necessitated after SP MLA Dara Singh Chauhan defected to the saffron outfit.Likewise, NISHAD party chief Sanjay Nishad’s son Pravin Nishad, lost to SP’s Pappu Nishad by a margin of over 92000 votes. Pravin, who has been contesting on a BJP ticket, was a sitting MP from Sant Kabir Nagar.Similarly, Apna Dal (S) could not help in consolidating the Kurmi vote bank as expected. So was the case with RLD which could not avert the loss in some of the Jat dominated constituencies, including Muzaffarnagar.“The loss clearly indicated an apparent drift of OBC votes away from the saffron camp, despite the party propping up its allies and a host of backward caste leaders,” observed an analyst, asserting that the BJP was bound to ask its allies to pare down their political ambitions in UP. Nevertheless, the BJP decided to accommodate allies like AD (S) and RLD in the union cabinet in its concerted bid to reach out to the Kurmi and Jat communities in UP and beyond.",The BJP is learnt to have decided to work on a two-pronged strategy: bolstering governance at the ground level and necessitating changes in the organisation. The party brass was categorically against pressing the panic button in what could relay signals of distress within the party.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110889321,imgsize-2538680,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/110889321.jpg"

Mix of old hands and new faces

Full list of the new council of ministers:

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi took the oath of office for a historic third consecutive term at 7.15pm on Sunday along with his council of ministers in an over 3-hour-long grand ceremony at the Rashtrapati Bhavan .As per media reports, the new Cabinet is scheduled to hold its first meeting on Monday evening at the Prime Minister's Lok Kalyan Marg residence.Ahead of the swearing-in ceremony , PM Modi had hosted a high tea for the 71 would-be council of ministers (which include 30 Cabinet ministers, 5 Ministers of State-Independent Charge, and 36 Ministers of State). The portfolios of the ministers have not yet been announced.The PM Modi 3.0 council of ministers include representation from all corners of the country as well as social groups. It has 27 ministers from Other Backward Classes, 10 from Scheduled Castes, 5 from Scheduled Tribes and 5 from minorities. A record 18 senior Ministers will be heading ministries.Modi Cabinet 3.0 includes 43 ministers who have served 3 terms or higher in Parliament, with 39 having been ministers in central government before. The list includes multiple former chief ministers and 34 ministers who have served in state legislatures and 23 having worked as ministers in states.There are also 33 first-timers in the ranks. Seven first-time ministers in the Modi government belong to the allies: TDP's K Rammohan Naidu and Chandrasekhar Pemmasani; JDU's Lalan Singh and Ram Nath Thakur, RLD's Jayant Chaudhary, LJP's Chirag Paswan and HD Kumaraswamy of the JD(S).The new faces also include Suresh Gopi, the actor-turned-politician who scripted history by becoming the first BJP MP from Kerala.The first-timers from the BJP are Kamlesh Paswan (Uttar Pradesh), Sukanta Majumder (West Bengal), Durga Das Uikey (Madhya Pradesh), Raj Bhushan Chaudhary (Bihar), Satish Dubey (Bihar), Sanjay Seth (Jharkhand), C R Paatil (Gujarat), Bhagirath Chaudhary (Rajasthan), Harsh Malhotra (Delhi), V Somanna (Karnataka), Savitri Thakur (UP).

BJP had won 303 seats in the 2019 general elections and 282 seats in the 2014 general elections.The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) unanimously passed a resolution to elect Narendra Modi as their leader on June 5.Several leaders and State heads of neighbourhood region and Indian Ocean region were invited for PM Modi's swearing-in ceremony as distinguished guests.After the last reshuffling of portfolios in the previous Modi government, the council of ministers had comprised the PM and 78 ministers, including 29 Cabinet Ministers, 3 Ministers of State (Independent Charge) and 47 Ministers of State.","PM Narendra Modi takes oath of office for historic third consecutive term, equals Jawaharlal Nehru's record.

BJP picks Odisha chief minister with an eye on Jharkhand,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-picks-odisha-chief-minister-with-an-eye-on-jharkhand/articleshow/110919910.cms,"NEW DELHI: The elevation of Mohan Charan Majhi as Odisha chief minister, a few months after Vishnu Deo Sai's appointment as CM in Chhattisgarh, is yet another indication of BJP 's desire to consolidate its appeal among tribals.Choosing two tribal leaders as CMs in close succession is seen as a follow through on the election of Droupadi Murmu as the country's first tribal woman President, a gesture seen as helping enhance BJP's appeal among tribals even in far-off states like Rajasthan and Gujarat.The nod for Manjhi did not come as a surprise, considering that Dharmendra Pradhan , the strongest contender for the job, was retained as Union minister after winning the Lok Sabha polls from Sambalpur. Importantly, Majhi is considered a close associate of Pradhan, with party circles seeing the latter as instrumental in selection of the Odisha CM-in-waiting.The choice also appears to have been influenced by coming elections in neighbouring Jharkhand where the party lost all the seats reserved for tribals.BJP celebrated Majhi's elevation as the party's continued focus on tribal empowerment, contrasting with Congress's approach towards the community, which accounts for over 7.5% of the country's population.""Excluding the north-eastern states, which are largely tribal-dominated, Congress has appointed no tribal CM in the 21st century. BJP has given four - Babulal Marandi, Arjun Munda, Vishnu Deo Sai and Mohan Majhi. And even in Assam, BJP made Sarbananda Sonowal the CM, while Congress made no tribal CM,"" railways and I&B minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said on X.","Mohan Charan Majhi elevation is yet another indication of BJP's desire to consolidate its appeal among tribals.

Labour pledges fresh inquiry into Thatcher's role in 1984 Operation Blue Star,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/labour-pledges-fresh-inquiry-into-thatchers-role-in-1984-operation-blue-star/articleshow/110776077.cms,"LONDON: The Labour party , which is forecast to win the July 4 UK general election, has pledged to hold an inquiry to investigate the role Britain played in storming the Golden Temple in June 1984 to remove Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and other Sikh militants, which triggered the assassination of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and the anti-Sikh riots.

Deputy Labour leader Angela Raynor said, “As we mark the 40th anniversary of the raid on the Golden Temple, Labour stands with the Sikh community in calling for an inquiry into the historic role Britain played. A Labour govt will work to determine the best way to find out the truth.”

Labour candidate for Coventry South Zarah Sultana said: “The role Thatcher’s govt played in this has been shrouded in secrecy. I stand with the Sikh community in calling for an inquiry to reveal the truth.” Labour candidate for Slough Tan Dhesi wrote on X: “40 years since Indira Gandhi ordered attack on Golden Temple complex…Still no justice for victims, nor UK inquiry (but Labour have promised) into Thatcher govt involvement!”

There has been no independent public inquiry into Margaret Thatcher’s involvement in Operation Blue Star , despite the release of classified documents in Jan 2014 implicating the UK govt.

Those files revealed that Britain had sent an SAS officer to India in Feb, ahead of Operation Blue Star, to draw up a plan to “remove Sikh extremists from the Golden temple”, having been asked to do so by Indira Gandhi.

The Heywood Review, commissioned by former PM David Cameron and published in Feb 2014, found no record of any UK assistance to the June 1984 operation other than the “limited military advice provided in mid-February”. The review, based on over 23,000 documents, said: “The recommendation and decision to agree this request were based on advice from the British high commission that it would be good for the bilateral relationship, whereas refusal would not be understood by Mrs Gandhi. There were significant differences between the actual June operation, and the advice from the UK military officer in Feb. The actual operation implemented by the Indian Army differed significantly from the approach suggested by the UK military officer.”

Many British Sikhs believe the Heywood Review is a whitewash and are calling for an independent judge-led public inquiry.

JOHANNESBURG: Former South African president Jacob Zuma 's uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) party has filed an application in the constitutional court to try to block the first sitting of the National Assembly since last month's election, it said on Tuesday.

South Africa 's newly elected parliament is due to convene on Friday for the swearing-in of lawmakers and the elections of its speaker and deputy speaker as well as the country's president.

Zuma's MK party came a surprisingly strong third in the May 29 vote but has alleged vote rigging took place and threatened to boycott the new parliament.

The Independent Electoral Commission and other parties said the election was free and fair, and South Africa does not have a history of significant vote fraud.

The election saw the African National Congress (ANC), Zuma's longtime political home, lose its parliamentary majority for the first time since it came to power at the end of apartheid 30 years ago.

The ANC is now negotiating with potential partners ranging from Marxists to free marketeers about setting up a national unity government.

","South Africa's new parliament is due to be sworn in on Friday. South Africa's first post-apartheid parliament was elected on May 25. The ANC won the most seats in the country's history, but is expected to lose the next election.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110902835,imgsize-1082461,width-400,resizemode-4/110902835.jpg"
