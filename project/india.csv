SRINAGAR: A day after National Conference (NC) MP from Srinagar, Aga Ruhullah Mehdi, said he would stage a protest outside J&K CM Omar Abdullah ’s residence over government’s failure to rationalise reservation policy, the party on Friday accused him of acting at the behest of central govt and asked him to resign if he remained unwilling to align with NC’s policies.“He (Mehdi) has friends in New Delhi and is acting on their behalf. This is New Delhi’s doing. Instead of blaming the J&K govt, he should ask his friends in New Delhi to ensure that the file on rationalisation of reservations, cleared by the J&K govt and forwarded by it to the lieutenant governor for approval, is still in LG’s office. Let him get it cleared from there,” said minister for jal shakti, forest and tribal affairs Javed Ahmad Rana.“Instead of protesting outside the LG’s residence or office, he is planning to protest against the popular govt that has already decided the matter. This is not morally correct,” Rana said. “We have done our job. It is now for the LG to act on it.”He also took a swipe at Mehdi, saying that many people who spend time in Delhi start moving in influential circles and then begin to “punch above their weight”.He said, “The Srinagar MP has caught the same infection. He believes he has become bigger than he is, but our party’s long experience shows that Delhi infection does not work in Jammu and Kashmir .”","National Conference (NC) MP from Srinagar, Aga Ruhullah Mehdi, said he would stage a protest outside J&K CM Omar Abdullah ’s residence.
