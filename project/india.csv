NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday questioned Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal 's aide Bibhav Kumar , who is accused of assaulting AAP MP Swati Maliwal , and expressed shock at the details of the incident recorded by the Delhi high court.""Is CM residence a private bungalow? Is this kind of 'goon' supposed to work in the CM's residence?"" the bench asked Singhvi, who said there were non-serious injuries and the FIR was lodged after three days of the incident on May 13.The bench further questioned Singhvi about the implications of Maliwal, an AAP Rajya Sabha MP, calling the police helpline during the assault. They emphasized that while they routinely grant bail to contract killers, murderers, and robbers, the nature of this incident troubled them.""Every day we grant bail to contract killers, murderers, robbers but the question is what kind of incident...He (Bibhav Kumar) acted as if some 'goon' had entered the official residence of CM,"" the Supreme Court observed.""We are shocked?

My shirt buttons opened and my shirt flew up. I landed on the floor while hitting my head on the centre table. I was constantly screaming for help but no one came.

Although restricted to Jiribam, govt sources described it as a big achievement towards their plans to bring back peace in the valley and hill areas of Manipur.The resolutions adopted said that ""both sides will make full efforts to bring normalcy and prevent incidents of arson and firing.""

Won't quit even if governor gives prosecution nod: Siddaramaiah,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/wont-quit-even-if-governor-gives-prosecution-nod-siddaramaiya/articleshow/112205612.cms,"Siddaramaiya

BENGALURU: As the possibility of Karnataka governor Thaawar Chand Gehlot giving sanction to prosecute CM Siddaramaiah over a land allotment scam at Mysuru Urban Development Authority loomed large on Thursday, the CM insisted he would fight the graft charge legally and politically, ruling out any possibility of resignation .The CM's firm stand followed a breakfast meet with his cabinet colleagues at his official residence, Cauvery, and a subsequent meeting of the council of ministers led by deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar.A meeting of the council of ministers was led by dy CM DK Shivakumar. CM Siddaramaiah, though, did not attend. Showing its intent to play hardball with the governor, the council of ministers decided to advise Gehlot to withdraw the show-cause notice and reject the petition that sought his sanction to prosecute Siddaramaiah.The two meetings aimed to ensure all ministers were on the same page before engaging in a legal and political battle against the BJP-JD(S) opposition combine. The opposition parties have already announced a seven-day padayatra to press for the CM’s resignation.“The show-cause notice to the CM is gross misuse of the constitutional office of governor and politically motivated,” Shivakumar said after the meeting. “It is a concerted effort to destabilise our govt, elected with a majority of 136 seats. The governor has not followed due procedure. He should have acted only on the advice of the council of ministers and not at his discretion,” he added.“The speed with which Raj Bhavan sent the show-cause notice to the CM — a few hours after the petition was filed — shows the governor did not even read the petition in detail since it contains about 60 pages. He did not apply his mind to the facts of the case or consider the material available on record,” said Shivakumar. He contrasted Gehlot’s alacrity with lethargy in cases involving BJP functionaries, including former ministers Shashikala Jolle and Murugesh Nirani, and the decade-long unresolved petition against former minister G Janardhana Reddy.On July 26, the governor had issued a show-cause notice to Siddaramaiah over the Muda scam. He is still awaiting his reply.Advocate and anti-graft activist TJ Abraham said if the governor green-lights prosecution under Prevention of Corruption Act, he “will immediately have to approach the magistrate’s court and seek directions for the police or Lokayukta to register an FIR and investigate the scam”. Abraham had petitioned the governor on July 26 seeking his sanction to prosecute Siddaramaiah.Alternatively, the court may directly start trial by issuing summons to the CM and his wife, potentially forcing Siddaramaiah to resign on moral grounds, Abraham added. Some legal experts, though, emphasised that resignation was not mandatory. “To resign or not to resign is more of a moral consideration. There is no law that specifies the requirement of resignation of the CM,” said a constitutional expert.Siddaramaiah’s stance mirrors Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal’s, who remained in office despite facing arrest in the alleged excise scam. Former CM BS Yediyurappa also continued to be in office despite facing prosecution under Corruption Act in 2011.Following discussions with the Congress high command, including AICC president Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday, a consensus was reportedly reached on taking BJP head-on.

Quota crusader who states his cause in black & white,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/quota-crusader-who-states-his-cause-in-black-white/articleshow/112209305.cms,"HYDERABAD: Apart from world leaders like Donald Trump, Barack Obama, Pope Francis, Vladimir Putin, former ISRO chief K Sivan and Hollywood star Hugh Jackman, there are very few people that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has publicly hugged. It is for this reason that many were surprised when he hugged and consoled a Dalit activist little known outside Telangana and Andhra Pradesh at a public meeting in Secunderabad on Nov 11 last year during the peak of the assembly election campaign in Telangana.Meet Manda Krishna Madiga , who has been fighting for sub-categorisation of Scheduled Castes (SCs) for three decades. At last year's public meeting with Madiga on stage, Modi announced that he supported the demand. An emotional Madiga couldn't hold back his tears and received a consoling hug from the PM.Those who saw TV footage of the meeting may not have given a second thought to the activist's attire, dressed in white shirt and black pants with a black scarf hanging loosely around his shoulders.What may seem like a dull detail is in fact a sign of Madiga's commitment to his cause. He has decided that he will keep wearing black as a mark of protest until discrimination against Dalits ends. Any picture from the past 30 years -- there are many of him protesting -- shows him in only black and white .""I will not change these two colours even if we succeed in our fight for sub-categorisation,"" Madiga had told TOI earlier during an exclusive interview. ""These are the only two colours I have and these are the only two colours I will wear until the day discrimination against Dalits ends.""The 59-year-old founded Madiga Reservation Porata Samithi (MRPS) on July 7, 1994, and has been raising the demand ever since. He decided not to give up the fight despite facing hurdles because he was confident the cause was genuine. ""Remember that when Ambedkar proposed reservation for SCs and STs, many people opposed but finally, it had become a reality,"" Madiga said.Explaining his conviction, Madiga pointed out that ""I kept the faith even when I felt bad over my fellow Madigas dying while fighting for justice"".""Many MRPS workers committed suicide and were murdered in the past years. In East and West Godavari districts in united Andhra Pradesh, MRPS workers died after they were attacked by other community members. But we decided not to take revenge as our primary aim of (SC) sub-categorisation would have been side-tracked,"" Madiga said.He added: ""MRPS workers also died at Gandhi Bhavan (Congress HQ at Hyderabad), when they tried to set ablaze furniture in 2009. AICC leader Sonia Gandhi, who was in the city to address a public meeting, had to cancel it. One MRPS Mahila Samakya worker died while staging a dharna at the Hyderabad collectorate in 2018.""","Manda Krishna Madiga has been fighting for sub-categorisation of Scheduled Castes (SCs) for three decades.

"Ruling a challenge for government, may intensify Dalit tensions",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ruling-a-challenge-for-government-may-intensify-dalit-tensions/articleshow/112209108.cms,"NEW DELHI: Passage of time has blunted the strident opposition that existed to the controversial proposal of sub-categorisation of Scheduled Castes, because its implementation in states for years made the hostile strong sub-castes reconcile to its possibility, which in turn made political parties shed fears of a backlash from the stronger sub-groups.But that is true only about the states, whom the Supreme Court has empowered to carry out sub-categorisation of SCs .In contrast, the apex court verdict has lobbed a nettlesome issue into the court of the Centre . BJP will be expected to spell out its stance on sub-categorising the SCs at the central level, since PM Narendra Modi is seen to have played the catalyst on the long dormant issue with his sharing of stage with Madiga activists in Telangana during the assembly election campaign, and his government's decision to send out a signal in favour of sub-classification with the constitution of a high-powered committee headed by the cabinet secretary ahead of the Lok Sabha polls.Dividing the SCs at the grand national level, away from localised state audiences, risks attracting the cumulative ire of stronger Dalit groups from across the states, who would view it as a hostile act cutting into their share of affirmative action benefits.How soon the Centre and the states act on the judgement would be keenly watched. What is likely to add an edge to the reaction of certain stronger groups, besides individual reactions across the board, is not sub-categorisation but the introduction of ""creamy layer"" among the Dalits, as ruled by the supreme court. Already a serious issue among the OBCs since the concept was introduced in the wake of Mandal commission, the extension of the weeding out criteria to Dalits would be watched for the response of the community.After all, as is argued, ""creamy layer"" has the potential to choke the supply line of Dalits into the representation chain, which is based on the competitive ability of groups which cannot be achieved overnight. It is a tricky issue, which can test the states as well as the Centre. Sub-categorisation entails division of the SC list into groups of communities based on their status of backwardness and apportioning of total quota quantum among them in proportion to their population.But the method of accomplishing it, with the supreme court seeking a survey for empirical data on representation of different castes in public services, puts the spotlight on the controversial issue of caste census. Observers say the green light to sub-classification of SCs can give a fresh impetus to demands for sub-categorisation of OBCs, an issue for which the Centre formed the Rohini commission but has been sitting on its report. The report was submitted on July 31, 2023, six years after it was constituted.There are already calls that caste census would be required for sub-classification of not just the SCs but also the OBCs. Caste census has emerged as the agenda of the opposition, with Congress, SP, DMK, RJD, its champions, as against the BJP which is seen as stonewalling the push.",Supreme Court verdict has lobbed a nettlesome issue into the court of the Centre.

Executive still holds key

BENGALURU: The spotlight is on Karnataka governor Thaawar Chand Gehlot as legal experts evaluate whether to permit prosecution of chief minister Siddaramaiah concerning allegations linked to the Mysore Urban Development Authority (Muda) land scam, which involves his wife BM Parvathi.On July 26, anti-corruption activist and advocate TJ Abraham formally requested the governor’s sanction to prosecute Siddaramaiah.In response, the governor sought a report from the state govt, which the chief secretary provided. Last week, Siddaramaiah personally met with the governor to discuss the case and provide context.Following the receipt of reports and documents related to the case, the governor referred the matter and Abraham’s complaint to legal experts for their insights. Sources indicate legal experts have submitted opinions referencing previous cases from Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka, where incumbent and former chief ministers faced prosecution based on the gov ernor’s directives. They also cited a relevant verdict from retired Supreme Court Justice Santhosh Hegde.Given the situation, Siddaramaiah has begun consultations with legal experts and Supreme Court counsels on steps he could take if the governor permits an investiga tion. A team of legal experts is currently reviewing past instances of the governor’s interventions and the relevant legal provisions to prepare for possible outcomes.Siddaramaiah is also expected to convene a cabinet meeting on Thursday in Bengaluru to pass a resolution opposing any consent for an investigation prior to the governor’s decision.Abraham, who initiated the request, asserted, “Chief minister Siddaramaiah, who also holds the finance portfolio, should be investigated as authorities and agencies under his purview are implicated in the case.”He is seeking sanction for investigation under Section 218 of the Bharatiya Nayaya Sanhita, 2023, and Sections 17A and 19 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.In 2011, governor Hansraj Bharadwaj granted consent to prosecute incumbent chief minister BS Yediyurappa in the land de-notification case. An FIR was filed and Yediyurappa spent 23 days in jail.Legal experts say the Supreme Court has established that the governor can act independently regarding prosecution against cabinet members and the chief minister, without needing a recommendation from the council of ministers.But even if the governor or a court orders prosecution, the executive retains the authority to withdraw the prosecution, leaving open questions regarding the chief minister’s potential actions in this high-profile case.On orders from the party high command, Siddaramaiah has directed all district in-charge ministers to visit flood-affected regions. Also, deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar will hold a breakfast meeting with ministers on Thursday. Siddaramaiah is also scheduled to attend the meeting.","The spotlight is on Karnataka governor Thaawar Chand Gehlot as legal experts evaluate whether to permit prosecution of chief minister Siddaramaiah.

VIJAYAWADA: Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu was the first political supporter in the region for the demand for sub-categorisation for scheduled castes .The struggle for sub-categorisation was launched by Manda Krishna Madiga in 1994 and Naidu, during his first stint as chief minister of combined Andhra Pradesh, extended his support for the demand in 1997.Naidu appointed Justice P Ramachandra Raju commission to study and recommend the way forward on various aspects of sub-categorisation.The commission after conducted a detailed study had recommended to divide scheduled castes into four groups.In the year 2000, during his second stint as the chief minister, Naidu implemented reservations in scheduled castes according to sub-categorisation.These reservations continued for four years till 2004 and several candidates from marginalised sections within the scheduled castes got jobs during this period.According to Manda Krishna Madiga, more than 22,000 candidates from the unrepresented or underrepresented castes availed govt jobs during this period.Even when the categorisation was struck down by the courts, Naidu supported the cause of Manda Krishna. During his tenure between 2014-19 as chief minister for newly formed state of Andhra Pradesh, Naidu passed an executive order (GO) to give some of the benefits of categorisation.In the absence of constitutionally valid reservations, Naidu shown political will to include the underrepresented sections into reservation net.Naidu consistently backed the issue of categorisation despite facing backlash from those who opposed it. Though some of the major political parties maintained conspicuous silence on the issue, Naidu had been the vocal supporter of the issue.Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the first time supported the issue before recent Telangana elections. The issue again came to light after Modi backed it.Welcoming the Supreme Court judgment, Telugu Desam party national general secretary, Nara Lokesh said that Naidu had implemented social justice 30 years ago through presidential ordinance. Thousands got govt jobs during that period and we have committed to the promise made in elections, he said, adding that socio economic and political development of all sections is and will remain the agenda of TDP.","The struggle for sub-categorisation was launched by Manda Krishna Madiga in 1994.
