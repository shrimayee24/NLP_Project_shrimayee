"Big victory for Hindu dharma, slap in the face for DMK: BJP",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/big-victory-for-hindu-dharma-slap-in-the-face-for-dmk-bjp/articleshow/126384875.cms,"NEW DELHI: BJP on Tuesday celebrated the Madras high court order as a “big victory” for Hindu dharma, justice for devotees and “slap for the appeasement politics” of DMK and its allies.Union minister Piyush Goyal, who is BJP’s in-charge for Tamil Nadu polls due in a few months, slammed the state govt over its likely move to appeal the order, saying it is a continuation of its “anti-Hindu” politics and people will teach it a lesson the same way they had humbled the INDIA bloc in Bihar.Goyal seized on the division bench decision to launch a broadside against the Opposition with an eye on the BMC polls in Maharashtra on Jan 15, noting that MPs of Congress, Shiv Sena (UBT) and NCP(SP), besides DMK, were signatories to a notice in Lok Sabha for a motion to remove Madras high court judge GR Swaminathan, who had originally passed the order upheld by the division bench.Uddhav Thackeray has turned “anti-Hindu” and given up on the ideals of his father Balasaheb Thackeray, he alleged, asserting that people of Maharashtra who have faith in Hindutva will never vote for anti-Hindu parties.As many as 107 MPs, including Priyanka Gandhi Vadra of Congress, had submitted a notice to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla against Justice GR Swaminathan during the last session of Parliament. The Speaker’s office is looking into the notice.","Piyush Goyal, who is BJP’s in-charge for Tamil Nadu polls due in a few months, slammed the state govt over its likely move to appeal the order.

"Uttarakhand: Govt open to ‘all forms of probe’, says Dhami on 2022 resort murder; CM to meet girl’s parents",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/uttarakhand-govt-open-to-all-forms-of-probe-says-dhami-on-2022-resort-murder-cm-to-meet-girls-parents/articleshow/126384268.cms,"Ankita Bhandari murder case: Sex rackets and drug abuse rampant at illegal resorts in Rishikesh, locals seek action

Amid growing demand for a CBI probe into the 2022 Rishikesh resort murder case, in which a 19-year-old receptionist was allegedly killed under mysterious circumstances, CM Pushkar Dhami Tuesday said his govt was open to “all forms of probe” to get answers. The incident had triggered massive protests across Uttarakhand at the time. Dhami said he would also meet the woman’s parents and discuss the matter with them.Calling the case “extremely heartbreaking and sensitive”, Dhami said sentiments of entire state were connected to the case. “Being the CM, I will meet them. After examining all legal aspects, whatever they say regarding justice for their daughter will be followed”.The CM said those involved in the crime would not be spared. “Earlier, it was due to a probe by SIT that three accused were sentenced to life. Some audio recordings have recently come to the fore. We have formed an SIT to probe the matter and the ex-MLA and others whose names have surfaced must cooperate. Instead of remaining on the run, those who made allegations should appear before police so the truth can come out,” he said.Not ruling out a “planned political conspiracy” behind the latest row, Dhami said a similar audio leak had surfaced during the exam paper leak issue. “Hue and cry was created then too. Now another audio leak is being used to spoil the environment of Uttarakhand,” he said, taking a swipe at Congress netas for trying to revive their political careers through the case.Questioning circumstances surrounding the clips, Dhami said it was suspicious that the phone was switched off after releasing the audio and a presser was held in Delhi though the matter pertained to Uttarakhand. He said police and social media records confirmed that the party in-charge named in one audio did not visit Uttarakhand during the period mentioned.Cops tried to approach those levelling fresh allegations and pasted notices at their houses, but they continue to avoid sleuths, he said.Police in Haridwar have constituted an SIT to probe the audio involving a woman, Urmila Sanawar, whose allegations have led to the political storm. The row escalated after several audio clips were allegedly released by Urmila, in which expelled former BJP MLA Suresh Rathore was purportedly referring to a “VIP” who he alleged was a senior BJP neta. It was insinuated that the “VIP” had visited the resort and “sought favours” from the receptionist.Rathore later denied allegations, claiming that the clips were “AI-generated”.","Ankita Bhandari, 19, was allegedly killed under mysterious circumstances.

Kushwahas’ fate uncertain as 3 of 4 party MLAs ‘revolt’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kushwahas-fate-uncertain-as-3-of-4-party-mlas-revolt/articleshow/126384242.cms,"PM Modi Reveals Why NDA Swept Bihar, Says Emotional Mode And 24x7 Development Win Elections In India

PATNA: The fate of Bihar’s panchayati raj minister Deepak Prakash hangs in the balance as Rashtriya Lok Morcha (RLM), founded and led by his father and former Union minister Upendra Kushwaha, looks set to split with three of the four party legislators likely to stake claim over the organisation as part of the NDA.The three MLAs — Rameshwar Mahto, Madhav Anand and Alok Kumar Singh — are reportedly angry with Kushwaha for making his son a minister despite his not being a member of either House of the state’s bicameral legislature.If that happens, neither BJP nor Janata Dal United — the two major NDA partners — will make Deepak an MLC, which he needs to become within six months to continue as a minister in the Nitish Kumar cabinet.Everyone was surprised when Kushwaha, whose Rajya Sabha membership expires in April, named his son, Deepak, as a minister from RLM quota instead of wife and Sasaram MLA Snehlata. If RLM indeed splits, prospects of another Rajya Sabha term for Kushwaha may also dim. Five Bihar seats in the Lower House are falling vacant in April.Bajpatti MLA Rameshwar Mahto said, “The decision to make Deepak a minister was wrong. We hoped Kushwaha would see reason, but in vain. The three of us are together but have not decided our next step — whether to leave the party or not — yet.”Madhav Anand, who is MLA from Madhubani, told TOI on phone from Delhi that RLM was united.“We will sit and discuss things if there is any resentment,” he said.The three MLAs had skipped the recent “litti party” hosted by Kushwaha and preferred to meet Nitin Nabin the same day after his appointment as BJP national working president. Mahto was unsparing when reminded that Kushwaha made his son minister “to keep the party united”, as he had said.“CM Nitish Kumar is my mentor, who always believes in doing what he says. I came with Kushwaha for his stand against dynastic politics. I could never imagine that he is floating the party for ‘Parivar’ politics. I have a roaring business and do politics to serve the poor, not for ‘parivar’. Party workers have hopes from their representatives... I started a charitable trust hospital for the poor soon after election,” Mahto said.However, RLM chief spokesman Ram Pukar Sinha said the party is united and everyone is working hard to make it stronger.Kushwaha, who had earlier founded RLSP which he later merged with JDU, served as Union minister of state for education in the first Modi govt from 2014-2019. Since then, he or his party has had little success till the Nov 2025 Bihar assembly election in which RLM managed to win four seats.","Deepak Prakash's fate hangs in the balance as Rashtriya Lok Morcha (RLM) looks set to split.

NEW DELHI: A Delhi court on Tuesday allowed forensic examination of the Unnao rape survivor's voice sample in a case relating to her alleged gang rape in June 2017, a week after she was raped by former BJP MLA Kuldeep Sengar.The order was passed on an application moved by the counsel for one of the accused, Shubham Singh.According to the defence counsel, the woman ""denied"" that the voice in certain recorded conversations belonged to her, even though those recordings were being relied upon during the trial.The defence has argued that these disputed recordings allegedly contain statements in which she admits ""she had left her house voluntarily"", which could be ""crucial objective evidence"".Taking note of the submission, special judge Murari Prasad Singh directed the voice sample be sent to CFSL for comparison with audio and video recordings already part of the case record. The judge clarified the forensic exam was being permitted only to aid the adjudicatory process, and evidentiary value of the forensic report would be examined and assessed at an appropriate stage.","A Delhi court on Tuesday allowed forensic examination of the Unnao rape survivor's voice sample.
