'Match-fixing will come to Bihar next': Rahul Gandhi attacks BJP over Maharashtra polls; alleges 'rigging',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/match-fixing-will-come-to-bihar-next-rahul-gandhi-attacks-bjp-over-maharashtra-polls-alleges-rigging/articleshow/121688049.cms,"Step 1: Rig the panel for appointing the Election Commission

Step 2: Add fake voters to the roll

Step 3: Inflate voter turnout

Step 4: Target the bogus voting exactly where BJP needs to win

Step 5: Hide the evidence

NEW DELHI: Leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi on Saturday again accused the Bharatiya Janata Party of engaging in ""poll rigging"". Citing last year's Maharashtra polls, he cautioned against similar ""match-fixing"" activities by the saffron party in the upcoming Bihar polls.""How to steal an election? Maharashtra assembly elections in 2024 were a blueprint for rigging democracy,"" he said as he went on to list out the alleged sequence. He noted that the alleged tampering begins by ""rigging the panel for appointing the Election Commission"".""It’s not hard to see why the BJP was so desperate in Maharashtra. But rigging is like match-fixing - the side that cheats might win the game, but damages institutions and destroy public faith in the result. All concerned Indians must see the evidence. Judge for themselves. Demand answers. Because the match-fixing of Maharashtra will come to Bihar next, and then anywhere the BJP is losing. Match-fixed elections are a poison for any democracy,"" he added.The opposition parties have consistently raised the allegations of poll rigging in Maharashtra polls, with leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge even calling for a going back to ballot paper system terming electronic voting machines (EVMs) as ""fraud"" and something that put the opposition at ""disadvantage"".The Election Commission, has however, rejected Rahul's charge of unexpected voter's spike in the Maharashtra polls calling it ""nothing unusual"".""During the assembly elections in Maharashtra 6,40,87,588 electors, who reached the polling station from 7 am to 6 pm, voted. About 58 lakh votes were polled per hour, on an average. Going by these average trends, nearly 116 lakh voters could have voted in the last two hours. Therefore, casting of 65 lakh votes by electors in two hours is much below the average hourly voting trends,"" a senior EC functionary had said earlier this year.They also pointed out that Congress's own polling agents were present at every booth during the elections and did not raise any credible complaints about irregular voting — neither during the scrutiny by returning officers nor before election observers the following day.","Leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi again accused the Bharatiya Janata Party of engaging in ""poll rigging"" Citing last year's Maharashtra polls, he cautioned against similar ""match-fixing"" activities by the saffron party in the upcoming Bihar polls.

"Bangladesh Supreme Court restores Jamaat's party registration, clears path to contest polls",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-supreme-court-restores-jamaats-party-registration-clears-path-to-contest-polls/articleshow/121557628.cms,"DHAKA:





Bangladesh's Supreme Court on Sunday ordered the Election Commission to restore the right-wing Jamaat-e-Islami's party registration, nearly eight months after the interim govt lifted a ban on it, clearing the way for its participation in future elections.Court officials said the SC's appellate division, led by chief justice Syed Refaat Ahmed, directed the commission to restore the party's registration.The apex court said it was up to EC to decide if Jamaat could contest polls using its traditional ""scale"" symbol.EC scrapped the registration of Jamaat, which was opposed to Bangladesh's 1971 independence from Pakistan, in Dec 2018 in line with a HC ruling. In 2013, SC cancelled the registration of the Jamaat-e-Islami, saying the party is unfit to contest national elections.Former PM Sheikh Hasina's govt slapped a total ban on the party days ahead of her ouster on Aug 5, 2024 in a violent mass movement led by a platform called Students against Discrimination (SAD).Jamaat and several other parties had backed SAD.After Hasina's ouster, the party appealed for a review of the 2013 court order banning it.""Today concludes the decade-long legal battle. We hope Bangladesh will have a vibrant parliament after this verdict. We hope voters will vote for the Jamaat candidate of their choice now,"" one of Jamaat's leading counsels Mohammad Shishir Manir said.","Bangladesh's Supreme Court orders the Election Commission to restore the right- wing Jamaat-e-Islami's party registration.
