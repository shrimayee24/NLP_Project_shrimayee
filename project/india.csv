CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu CM M K Stalin announced Saturday he would take a pledge on his birthday to resist the ""imposition of a dominant language"" - indirectly referring to Hindi. He launched a sharp attack on the Centre over its three-language policy under NEP, alleging it was a ploy to impose Hindi in non-Hindi-speaking states while claiming to promote regional languages.""Punjab and Telangana have exposed the blatant lie of BJP govt at Centre that the three-language policy is being implemented through NEP to promote and spread regional languages,"" Stalin said. He lauded the state govts for making Punjabi and Telugu compulsory in schools. ""The path shown by TN is the path to be followed by every state to save its mother tongue. The announcement by govts of Punjab and Telangana has confirmed that this is a path to identify dominant languages and avoid falling into their trap.""Recalling TN's strong resistance to Hindi, including the 1967 anti-Hindi agitation in which several people lost their lives, Stalin said: ""Your birthday wishes have inspired me to work more resolutely and carry forward the struggle for protection of the Tamil race and language. On this birthday, I take a pledge to stop the imposition of the dominant language and save Tamil.""State BJP announced a boycott of the all-party meet called by Stalin on March 5 to discuss the possible impact of the delimitation process on TN.

SC acquits Haryana woman in 23-year-old murder case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-acquits-haryana-woman-in-23-year-old-murder-case/articleshow/118654253.cms,"Supreme Court has acquitted a Haryana woman in a 23-year-old murder case , ruling that mere suspicion cannot be the basis for conviction.The top court overturned the decisions of both the trial court in Jind and Punjab and Haryana high court , which had found her guilty. A division bench comprising Justice MM Sundresh and Justice Rajesh Bindal said the prosecution failed to present conclusive evidence linking Bhanmati to the crime.SC found flaws in the lower courts’ reasoning, particularly their reliance on the recovery of a “gandasi” (axe) as evidence. It said the axe was found much later than the victim’s body and that there were no fingerprints of the accused on it.“Suffice it is to state that the materials presented by the prosecution are not sufficient enough to unerringly point out the guilt on the part of the appellant alone,” SC ruled.The case dates back to December 11, 2002, when the body of a four-and-a-half-year-old boy was discovered in a village well in Kila-Jaffargarh of Jind.The boy’s father lodged an FIR next day and during the probe , Bhanmati was accused of the crime. She was convicted by the trial court, a decision later upheld by a division bench of HC comprising Justice Mahesh Grover and Justice Shekhar Dhawan.Advocate Ram Naresh Yadav, who represented Bhanmati in SC, argued the evidence was inadequate. “Even assuming the recovery to be true, it alone would not be sufficient, as there is no evidence to show that it was used for committing the offence,” he contended. The prosecution had claimed Bhanmati committed the crime due to a family dispute, alleging the mother of the deceased had been beating her children.However, SC found this motive unconvincing. Even at that point of time, the appellant was a middle-aged woman and her children were major while the deceased was only 4.5 years old, the bench said.","The case dates back to December 11, 2002, when the body of a four-and-a-half- year-old boy was discovered in a village well.

Currently, only 12 out of 36 states have completed their elections, necessitating elections in at least six additional states.Party sources indicate that presidential elections in key states including Bihar, Uttar Pradesh , Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, and Haryana should conclude within seven to ten days.Bihar is likely to retain its current state president. Once these elections are completed, the party will move forward with electing its new National President.In Uttar Pradesh, district presidential elections are expected to wrap up within three to four days, followed by the state presidential election. A new state president for Uttar Pradesh should be in place within seven to ten days.Current BJP chief JP Nadda has led the party since January 2020, after initially serving as acting president from June 2019. Under his leadership, the BJP contested elections in 35 states, securing victories in 16, and won the Lok Sabha elections to retain power.","The selection process was postponed due to Delhi assembly polls and pending polls in several state units.
