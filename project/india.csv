NEW DELHI: Citing a report, Congress on Saturday alleged a discrepancy of nearly 5 crore votes between the initial and final counts of the Lok Sabha polls , which they claim would have given the INDIA bloc the most seats in Parliament. This claim is based on a report titled 'Report: Conduct of Lok Sabha Elections 2024', released by ' Vote for Democracy .'A discrepancy of nearly 5 crores votes between the initial votes counted and the final votes counted,"" Pawan Khera said in a post on X.""The report claims that a minimum of 79 seats in 15 states could have been won by the NDA/BJP through the hike in the votes, implying that if true, the INDIA alliance would have the maximum seats in the parliament,"" the post further added.He urged the Election Commission of India ( ECI ) to address the report and provide clarification, asserting that if the report's findings are true, it would mark a significant turning point in the political history of Indian democracy.The 226-page report accuses the ECI of being ""unbefitting of a Constitutional authority"" and alleges that the poll body has hit an ""unprecedented low for the Institution."" The report said that the data of the seven phase poll was provided in a skeletal way and that the data of the phase 2 was never provided.The report claims that there were signs of voting manipulation and potential rigging in the Lok Sabha 2024 elections.

I was not allowed even (those) seven minutes. I would have completed all that I had to say, even if the seven minutes were allowed. But they rang the bell at five minutes, and I said, okay then I shall leave... and I left.""""I was the only one (from opposition-governed states) present there; they should have allotted at least half-an-hour for me... and I am not an irresponsible person that I will not maintain my time,"" she added.She further said, ""Chandrababu Naidu (Andhra Pradesh CM) presented his views for 20 minutes and CMs of Assam, Arunachal, Chhattisgarh and Goa also presented their views for 15, 16, 17, 20 minutes.

Former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh claimed that deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis pressured him to file false affidavits against MVA leaders, offering freedom from investigations in return.

NAGPUR: The political slugfest in Maharashtra intensified on Thursday as former home minister Anil Deshmukh dared deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis to make public the video clips allegedly showing Deshmukh speaking against NCP (SP) chief Sharad Pawar and Shiv Sena (UBT) president Uddhav Thackeray.Talking to the media, the Katol MLA brandished a pen drive, claiming it contained evidence of how Fadnavis, through central govt agencies like ED and CBI, had allegedly pressured him to sign false affidavits aimed at toppling the MVA govt.“If anyone challenges me to show proof against Fadnavis, I will hand over this pen drive with video evidence at an appropriate time. I don’t speak without proof,” Deshmukh warned, responding to Fadnavis’ recent threat to release evidence against him.Deshmukh, home minister in MVA govt, stepped down in April 2021 following accusations by then Mumbai CP Param Bir Singh that he instructed police to collect money from hotel and bar owners in the city.Recounting the events, Deshmukh said the controversy erupted after an explosive device was found outside noted industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence. The subsequent investigation implicated Singh, leading to his transfer and suspension.Deshmukh alleged that Singh, under Fadnavis’ direction, made false accusations against him. “Singh never appeared for the investigation. Instead, he submitted an affidavit to the court admitting he had no evidence against me and that his allegations were based on hearsay,” he said.The NCP leader also claimed that following Singh’s affidavit, Fadnavis pressured him to make false accusations against key MVA figures, including Uddhav and Aaditya Thackeray, then deputy CM Ajit Pawar, and minister Anil Parab. “If I had complied with Fadnavis’ demands three years ago, I would have avoided jail, but the MVA govt would have collapsed,” he added.Deshmukh reiterated his allegation from Wednesday that an ‘intermediary’ of Fadnavis had asked him to provide affidavits against important MVA figures to avoid legal troubles himself.However, Fadnavis, who holds the home department, had denied these accusations. He countered by suggesting that Deshmukh’s own party leaders had provided incriminating audio-visual evidence against him.Deshmukh’s allegations sent ripples in Maharashtra’s politics and the confrontation has escalated amidst preparations for the upcoming assembly polls.

BJP accused the AAP government of corruption and neglecting development in Delhi, calling for resignations. AAP defended its record, highlighting transparent governance and revenue surplus. Both parties traded allegations as election tensions rise.

NEW DELHI: Even as AAP announced that INDIA bloc of opposition parties will hold a rally on July 30 at Jantar Mantar here to raise the issue of Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal's declining health in Tihar jail , Congress functionaries had “no idea” when asked whether they would join.
