Jan Suraaj Party chief Prashant Kishor on Wednesday called the Waqf Amendment Bill an attempt at political polarisation and also attacked Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar for supporting it.Speaking to ANI, Kishor said the Bill is being pushed through without taking the affected communities into confidence. He pointed out that many Muslims feel threatened by it and criticised the government for rushing the legislation.""It is unfortunate... If changes impact any section, they should be taken into confidence. Many Muslims feel threatened. The government is rushing this for polarisation politics,"" Kishor said.Kishor did not hold back in his attack on Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar. He argued that the BJP does not consider Muslims its vote bank, but leaders like Nitish Kumar claim to support the community while backing laws that harm them. He accused Kumar of hypocrisy, saying that despite invoking leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Ram Manohar Lohia, and Jayaprakash Narayan, Kumar is helping the BJP pass a Bill that many Muslims oppose.""The government does not have a majority in the Lok Sabha. If leaders like Nitish Kumar refuse to support this Bill, it cannot become law. When history is written, the blame for this law will fall more on leaders like Nitish Kumar than on the BJP,"" Kishor said.Last week, Kishor also participated in a protest against the Waqf Amendment Bill organised by the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) at Gardanibagh in Patna.His party, Jan Suraaj, has been trying to appeal to Muslim voters by presenting itself as an alternative to the RJD. He claims that Muslims vote for RJD out of fear of the BJP and accuses Nitish Kumar's JD(U) of betraying them.The Waqf Amendment Bill is set to be tabled in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday. The bill has faced resistance from opposition parties and Muslim organisations like the AIMPLB. Despite opposition, the NDA has a majority in both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, making its passage likely.",Jan Suraaj Party chief Prashant Kishor attacked Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar.

Uttarakhand Waqf Board chairman says those opposing Waqf bill are 'political Muslims',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/uttarakhand-waqf-board-chairman-says-those-opposing-waqf-bill-are-political-muslims/articleshow/119890438.cms,"Shadab Shams (left)

NEW DELHI: Uttarakhand Waqf Board chairman Shadab Shams on Wednesday criticized the opposition for opposing the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024. He said that poor Muslims have expectations from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and described the situation as ""70 saal vs Modi Karyakal"" (PM Modi’s term versus the past 70 years).Shams said that the Central government, under PM Modi, has decided to bring poor Muslims into the mainstream.""Poor Muslims have hopes from PM Modi, and that is why we have named this amendment bill as 'Ummeed'. Union minister Kiren Rijiju is the ray of hope. PM Modi's government has decided that it will bring the poor Muslims into the mainstream. It is '70 saal Vs Modi Karyakal',"" Shams said while talking to the news agency ANI.He further criticized the opposition, saying they had 70 years in power and misused Waqf resources.""They (the opposition) looted the Waqf. They looted the rights of the poor. They are scaring the Muslims by saying that mosques will be taken away. Those who are opposing are not Muslims. They are political Muslims of Congress, Samajwadi Party, AAP, and Janata Dal. There are NGOs and committees behind them, such as Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind and the Muslim Personal Law Board, who want to go to the Rajya Sabha through a backdoor. All of them are Waqf beneficiaries. They are worried that it would be taken away from them. They are worried because it will be taken away from the rich. We are sure that PM Modi will pass the Waqf Amendment Bill and give the poor Muslims their rights,"" he added.The Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024, is scheduled to be introduced in Parliament today. Both the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress have asked their MPs to be present.The bill will be presented after the Question Hour and will be followed by an 8-hour discussion, which may be extended.Allies of the BJP and Congress have also instructed their MPs to be present in Parliament on April 2 and 3.The opposition has opposed the bill, with Samajwadi Party (SP) chief whip Dharmendra Yadav instructing all SP MPs in the Lok Sabha to attend the discussion.The bill was first introduced in the Lok Sabha in August last year. A Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC), led by Jagdambika Pal, was later formed to review it.The bill seeks to amend the Waqf Act, 1995, to improve the management and regulation of Waqf properties. It proposes renaming the Act, updating the definition of Waqf, improving registration procedures, and increasing the use of technology in maintaining Waqf records.The Waqf Act, 1995, was originally enacted to regulate Waqf properties, but concerns have been raised about mismanagement, corruption, and encroachments.","Waqf Board chairman Shadab Shams criticized the opposition for opposing the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024.

The Sena filed an FIR against Kamra the same day.The banker got a call from the police on March 28 and then a notice on his WhatsApp on March 29 under Section 179 of CrPC, requesting his presence the following day. He said, ""I had left Mumbai on March 21 for the trip and was supposed to return on April 6. But I returned midway after repeated calls from the police while I was in Tamil Nadu. The officer who called me was sceptical about my out-of-town status and threatened to visit my Kharghar residence. This prompted me to cut short my trip and return early.""The notice sought his witness statement under CrPC. The banker told TOI, ""Despite me saying that I had booked a ticket for the show online and that I had proof of booking, the cops said I might have edited the video Kamra has recorded. Why will the comedian hand over his shows video to me (for editing)?""Cops have started recording the statement of the cameraperson who recorded the video and statements of other staffers who were present when the video was shot Feb 2.

However, police withheld information on the total number of audience members who had been served notices under Section 179 of the CrPC during investigation.Responding to TOI's report Tuesday about audience members being summoned, Kamra posted on X, ""How to kill an Artist: a step-by-step guide - outrage (just enough for brands to stop commissioning their work), outrage more (until private and corporate gigs dry up), outrage louder (so big venues won't take risk), outrage violently (until even smallest spaces shut their doors), summon their audience for questioning (turning art into a crime scene). Now artist is left with only two choices: Sell their soul and become a dollar puppet - or wither in silence.""Kamra has got two notices so far from Khar police asking him to appear.

Let's see if Uddhav will uphold the ideas of Balasaheb Thackeray Sena, the Emperor of Hindu Hearts, and the venerable Shiv Sena chief Balasaheb Thackeray, or will he continue to follow in the footsteps of Rahul Gandhi and appease him?"" Fadnavis posted in Marathi on his X handle.Shiv Sena (UBT) is a former ally of Fadnavis' Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). In November 2019, the then-united Shiv Sena parted ways with the BJP , its long-time ally, and formed Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) with ideological rivals Congress and Nationalist Congress Party. Thackeray then became the leader of the MVA government in Maharashtra.However, in June 2022, Eknath Shinde of the Shiv Sena caused a vertical split in the party and triggered collapse of the Thackeray-led MVA regime. The faction led by Shinde, now Maharashtra's deputy chief minister, is recognised by the Election Commission as the ""real"" Shiv Sena, while the original group is called Shiv Sena (UBT).The Waqf (Amendment) Bill, to be moved by Centre's BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government in the Lok Sabha, is set to face stiff resistance from the Congress-led opposition INDIA bloc.
