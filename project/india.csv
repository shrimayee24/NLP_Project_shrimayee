Justice Michael D'Cunha Commission of Inquiry's preliminary report has identified financial mismanagement in the procurement of medical supplies during BJP-led administration and recommended the prosecution of (then chief minister) Yediyurappa and (then health minister) Sriramulu under the Prevention of Corruption Act,"" said health minister Dinesh Gundu Rao.He added that the full report was expected in six to seven months.The controversy stems from the commission's preliminary report submitted on Aug 31 accusing BJP govt of spending around Rs 7,224 crore on medical equipment and PPE kits during the pandemic.State govt subsequently set up an SIT and a subcommittee to decide the next course of action.Yediyurappa, in a strong rebuttal, dismissed the accusations as politically motivated. ""This is an old issue being dredged up for political gain. We committed no scam. Everything was done within legal parameters,"" he said.Sriramulu echoed Yediyurappa's defense, branding the allegations as ""politically motivated"".Earlier, Gundu Rao accused the former BJP govt of profiting from the pandemic. ""There was a loss of about Rs 14 crore in the procurement of PPE kits. They were purchased from China, even though domestic supplies were available, and at inflated prices. There are several discrepancies in the procurement of oxygen cylinders, masks, and medicines,"" Rao alleged.Rao added that notices would soon be served to the officials involved, and that charges would be filed where possible. ""While some cases will require further investigation, action can be taken immediately in others,"" the minister said.On the commission's recommendation to recover Rs 500 crore, Rao has noted that a separate team would be formed to pursue the recovery after the bypolls. He also hinted that the investigation could implicate K Sudhakar, who succeeded Sriramulu as the state health minister.","Congress government in Karnataka has stirred fresh controversy by allegedly leaking parts of an inquiry commission's preliminary report.

NEW DELHI: A minor student from Fatehpur, who moved to Kanpur to prepare for her medical entrance exam, Neet, was allegedly held hostage and raped by two teachers at a prominent coaching institute. The ordeal began in December 2022, when she was just 17 years old and residing at a hostel in Kanpur.The student recounted the horror in her complaint, saying that one of her teachers, Sahil Siddiqui, invited her to his friend's flat for a New Year's party and mentioned that other students would be there as well. However, upon reaching the venue, she found only Siddiqui, who drugged her by lacing her soft drink with sedatives and raped her, while also recording the act.Siddiqui allegedly held her hostage in his flat for over six months, during which he repeatedly raped her and threatened her with dire consequences. Another teacher, Vikas Porwal, also raped her a few months later.The student mentioned in her FIR that she was afraid to seek police help, fearing it might put her family in danger. It wasn't until six months later, when her mother arrived in Kanpur and took her away, that she found the courage to approach the police.The breaking point came when she saw a video of Siddiqui sexually harassing another coaching student. Both teachers have been arrested and charged with offenses of rape, wrongful confinement, criminal intimidation, and provisions under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO).","A minor student from Fatehpur, who moved to Kanpur to prepare for her medical entrance exam, Neet, was allegedly held hostage and raped by two teachers.

The expression was first used by the UP CM at a rally in Agra in the backdrop of Hindu minorities being subjected to violence in Bangladesh.Later, PM Modi and RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat also made similar pitches for Hindu unity later.

Earlier in the day, Pawar spoke to reporters in Nanded. Reacting to the ""Batenge to Katenge"" slogan, Sharad Pawar said: ""Elections come and go, but no one should sow seeds of discord between castes and religions. Unfortunately, BJP and its allies are indifferent to this responsibility."" He said politicians like Yogi Adityanath are brought in to campiagn in Maharashtra specifically for communal polarisation.""Sharad Pawar also spoke about the internal disruptions in NCP and stated that three individuals fuelled mistrust and weakened the party.

""For the past 10-12 years, Narendra Modi govt has been in place, yet farmers' condition has worsened. Despite efforts to become self-sufficient, especially in agricultural processing industries, current govt's policies have undone much of that progress."" Pawar lauded late Vilasrao Deshmukh for fostering industry in Latur, emphasizing that balanced growth in both agriculture and manufacturing was essential.In Parli, Pawar's speech was particularly sharp. Speaking at a rally for NCP candidate Rajesaheb Deshmukh, he said, ""It has been some time since I last visited Parli. Recently, lawlessness and 'gundagiri' have increased here. Beed once supported all our MLAs, but power has gone to the heads of certain individuals too quickly, leading to hardship for the people. This must stop.""

AKOLA/NANDED: PM Narendra Modi Saturday accused Congress of running Pakistan's agenda by pushing for restoration of Article 370 in J&K, which the BJP-led Centre nullified in 2019, and cited a recent resolution moved in J&K assembly by the grand old party's ally, National Conference, to prove his allegation. Addressing poll rallies in Maharashtra's Akola and Nanded, he said that only Pakistan, Congress and anti-India forces were unhapppy with the removal of Article 370, an action which brought peace and progress to Kashmir. ""We buried Article 370 forever to bring justice and rights to Kashmir's Dalit community for the first time in 75 years,"" Modi said.He criticised Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) and particularly Congress for turning the states governed by it into ""ATMs for the party's royal family"". The PM claimed that Congress-governed states like Himachal Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka became ""money spinning machines"" for the party.

NEW DELHI: Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge countered Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s criticism of the Congress’ adherence to the Constitution on Saturday, urging his party’s candidate Nitin Raut to send a copy of the text to PM Modi. In a fiery address in Nagpur, Kharge rebutted Modi’s claim that the Congress’ “Laal Kitab” (red book) of the Constitution is “empty,” labeling the statement a “disregard for Babasaheb Ambedkar’s legacy.”“This is the Constitution; it has everything inside it,” Kharge said, holding up a copy for the audience. “He [PM Modi] said the pages of this red book which Rahul Gandhi reads are blank. He called it 'kora kaagaz' (blank paper)... Read this; is it blank? Sahab, everything is written in it,” Kharge asserted, as he called on Raut to deliver a copy to Modi directly.Earlier in the day, PM Modi criticized Congress for allegedly exploiting the Constitution, calling their use of the “Laal Kitab” a “political farziwada” (fraud). ""In 'farziwada,' Congress has broken its own record,"" Modi remarked. “The Laal Kitab of the Constitution which the Congress party was flaunting contained 'nothing.' It was an empty book. This is nothing but a testament to Congress’ disregard and hate for Baba Saheb Ambedkar.”Kharge further accused the BJP of only recently acknowledging Ambedkar’s role in Indian history. “They used to say that Babasaheb’s Constitution was not right for them and should instead be based on ‘Manusmriti.’ Today, Modi Ji comes to Nagpur and pays tribute to Babasaheb's photo. I want to ask BJP supporters why there was no photo of Ambedkar in their offices before.”Kharge also questioned PM Modi's intentions toward the Constitution, claiming the prime minister would have sought changes if given a stronger mandate. “If Narendra Modi had the majority, who knows how many changes he would have made to the Constitution,” he said, adding, “Modi Ji stands on two legs, and both are artificial. One leg is TDP, and the other is JDU. If those two legs are removed, Modi Ji will not even be able to walk; he will have to sit down. If anything happens to the Constitution, RSS and Modi Ji will be responsible because their ideology says so.”Highlighting the Congress’ work in Congress-led states, Kharge defended the party’s pledges. “Modi Ji says that all of Congress’ guarantees are lies. If so, tell us what is a lie. We have fulfilled guarantees in Telangana, Karnataka, and Himachal Pradesh,” he said, citing funds set aside in Karnataka’s budget. “In Karnataka, we allocated 9,657 crores for the Greh Laxmi Yojana, of which 5,164 crores have been spent. For the Shakti Scheme providing free bus travel for women, a budget of 5,000 crores was set, with 2,708 crores already utilized,” Kharge outlined, countering accusations of empty promises.","Mallikarjun Kharge rebuts PM Modi's criticism of the Congress' adherence to the Constitution.

The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections , which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases. The results will be declared on November 23, along with Maharashtra.In the Tribal-dominated state, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and CM Hemant's Soren Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) are in a direct fight, while the Congress party and Lalu Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) are in alliance with the JMM.The JMM-Congress-RJD alliance are also reportedly seeking to deal with Left parties, Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party and other tribal outfits that have been contesting the elections in the state as independent entities and make efforts to field candidates against the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) on all 81 seats collectively.In the last assembly polls in 2019, the JMM-Congress-RJD alliance won a comfortable majority of 47 seats in a House of 81.The BJP slipped to 25 seats from 37 it held in 2014. The poor performance was perceived to be the outcome of its decision to contest alone backfiring. The party did not foster an alliance with the Ajsu in the 2019 polls when Raghubar Das, currently the Odisha governor, was serving the state as CM.In this year's Lok Sabha polls in Jharkhand, the BJP-led NDA secured nine out of the 14 seats, with the BJP winning eight and its alliance partner, the Ajsu (All Jharkhand Students Union) Party, retaining its single seat.On the other hand, the opposition India bloc improved its tally, increasing its seat count from two in 2019 to five in the parliamentary polls.BJP and JMM have spruced up their pace of campaigning from the ground zero to social media. BJP and JMM leaders are actively rebutting and challenging each other on a range of issues, including illegal immigration, youth welfare, employment and housing.INDIA bloc parties in Jharkhand slammed the EC for holding assembly elections in the state along with that of Maharashtra but claimed that they were ready to slug it out with BJP-led NDA, which has welcomed the announcement of poll dates.JMM, Congress, and CPI (ML-L) said the announcement showed that EC was in a hurry to conduct elections though the assembly tenure was due to end in January next year.Also, both the INDIA bloc and BJP-led NDA are expected to get into huddles to discuss the modalities of seat-sharing which is going to be a challenge for both the competing teams.","The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections, which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra. Elections in Maharashtra will be held in single phase on November 20. The counting of votes will be on November 23.Maharashtra is gearing up for elections as the two major political alliances—the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) and the Mahayuti—prepare to face each other for the first time in a Vidhan Sabha election.The Maha Vikas Aghadi, comprise of the Congress, the Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray), and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) under Sharad Pawar, will go head-to-head with the Mahayuti , which includes the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Shiv Sena faction led by Eknath Shinde, and the NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar. This will be the first electoral contest between these two alliances since the splits within the Shiv Sena and NCP.The MVA is hopeful of replicating its recent Lok Sabha success, while the Mahayuti aims to retain power by leveraging its populist schemes targeted at women and youth. Both alliances have set their sights on winning the state.Narayan Rane, a former Union Minister and the victor in the Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg Lok Sabha constituency, is poised to be a key figure for the BJP in the Konkan region during the forthcoming elections. Meanwhile, two constituencies are expected to be critical battlegrounds: chief minister Eknath Shinde's Kopri-Pachpakdi seat in Thane City and Worli in Mumbai, where Aaditya Thackeray, a leader of the Shiv Sena (UBT), is seeking reelection.In the last Vidhan Sabha elections in 2019, the BJP secured 26.1% of the votes, the Congress 16.1%, the NCP 16.9%, and the Shiv Sena 16.6%. The BJP and the Shiv Sena (then united) formed the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which secured a majority. However, the coalition soon crumbled due to disagreements over government formation, plunging the state into a political crisis.After no party could establish a government, Maharashtra was placed under President's rule. Devendra Fadnavis was briefly sworn in as chief minister, with Ajit Pawar as deputy chief minister. However, both resigned just days later before a scheduled floor test.By November 28, 2019, a new coalition emerged, with the Shiv Sena (Uddhav faction), NCP (Sharad Pawar faction), and Congress forming the Maha Vikas Aghadi government, led by Uddhav Thackeray as chief minister.The state's politics took another turn in June, 2022, when Uddhav Thackeray resigned following a rebellion within the Shiv Sena, led by Eknath Shinde, who then allied with the BJP. Eknath Shinde assumed the role of chief minister, with Devendra Fadnavis returning as deputy chief minister.",The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra. Elections in Maharashtra will be held in single phase on November 20. The counting of votes will be on November 23.
