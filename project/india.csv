'Can't save religion when deputy CM's wife busy making reels': Kanhaiya Kumar's remarks on Devendra Fadnavis' wife Amruta sparks row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cant-save-religion-when-deputy-cms-wife-busy-making-reels-kanhiya-kumars-remarks-on-devendra-fadnavis-wife-amruta-sparks-row/articleshow/115291707.cms,"-

BJP condemns Kanhaiya's remarks

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Kanhaiya Kumar has ignited a political storm with his controversial comments targeting Maharashtra's deputy chief minister, Devendra Fadnavis , and his wife, Amruta. The remarks, made during a rally in Nagpur on Wednesday, have drawn sharp condemnation from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Kanhaiya, while addressing the crowd, took aim at Fadnavis' recent comments referring to the upcoming elections as a ""Dharamyudh"", suggesting that the protection of religion should be a collective effort. He said that the job of ""saving religion"" should not be reduced to political rhetoric while the Deputy CM’s wife engages in ""making Instagram reels.""""Deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said that this is a 'Dharamyudh'. This is a good thing. It is our Dharam to protect the democracy and the constitution for which I am standing and giving a speech today. Whichever leader talks about saving religion, you have to ask only one thing to that leader who is giving you speech about saving religion that will your son or daughter join us in this fight to save religion?"" he questioned.""Will this happen that the responsibility of saving the religion will be ours and your children will study in Oxford Cambridge universities. If we want to save religion, let us save it together. It can't be like we save religion and the deputy chief minister's wife makes reels on Instagram. It can't be like that. Everyone will save the religion together,"" Kanhaiya added.The remarks were a direct response to Fadnavis' recent statement during his campaign for Mahayuti candidates, where he had called for a ""Dharma-Yuddha"" to counter what he described as ""vote-jihad"" in the state.The BJP was quick to condemn Kanhaiya Kumar’s comments, with party spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla leading the charge. Poonawalla labelled Kanhaiya as a ""Naxali Afzal Guru supporter"" and accused him of disrespecting Marathi women by targeting""How dare you insult a daughter of Maharashtra, Kanhaiya Kumar? Your words are an insult to every Marathi woman,"" Poonawalla wrote on social media platform X (formerly Twitter). ""Amruta Fadnavis is a proud daughter of Maharashtra, and those who use such derogatory language will face the consequences from the people of Maharashtra.""Poonawalla's statement referred to Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Arvind Sawant's statement who in late October faced backlash for calling Shiv Sena candidate Shaina NC ""imported maal"" during the Maharashtra Assembly election campaign. In his defence, Sawant denied mentioning Shaina’s name, clarifying, ""I only said that someone who is an outsider will not be able to work here."" He emphasised respect for Shaina, calling her a friend.The Maharashtra assembly elections are set for November 20, with the counting of votes scheduled for November 23. In the 2019 state elections, the BJP secured 105 seats, while the Shiv Sena won 56, and Congress claimed 44 seats, out of 288. However, in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the MVA coalition saw a strong showing, winning 30 of the 48 available seats, while the Mahayuti could only secure 17.","Congress leader Kanhaiya Kumar has ignited a political storm with his controversial comments targeting Maharashtra's deputy chief minister, Devendra Fadnavis.

He, however, added that Adani hosted the dinner but “was not participating in the political discussions.”Pawar Senior made these remarks in an interview with The News Minute-Newslaundry . He said that apart from him, those present were Adani, Amit Shah , and Ajit Pawar. The power-sharing talks took place before Ajit Pawar’s early morning swearing-in as deputy chief minister, with Devendra Fadnavis as CM, to form a govt that lasted barely 80 hours.Pawar Senior was quoted by the news portal as saying that his NCP colleagues, many of whom faced cases from Central agencies, told him they had been assured that if they joined hands with BJP, the cases would go away. Pawar, according to the report, said he pushed back as he was not convinced that BJP would keep its promise, but his colleagues said “why not hear it from the horse’s mouth” and that was how he found himself at a dinner at Adani’s residence, with Amit Shah present.Referring to the meeting, Ajit Pawar had said, “It has been five years, everyone knows where the meeting happened, it was in Delhi at a businessman’s house, everyone knows it. Yes, there were five meetings… Amit Shah was there, Gautam Adani was there, Praful Patel was there, Devendra Fadnavis was there, Ajit Pawar was there, Pawar Saheb was there… All were there... Everything was decided.” He had further said, “Blame for it has fallen on me, and I have taken it. I took blame and made others safe.”When he was asked why Pawar Senior had later hesitated and not gone with BJP, Ajit had said he didn’t know. “Pawar Saheb is a leader whose mind no one in the world can read. Not even our aunty (Sharad Pawar’s wife Pratibha) or our Supriya (Sule),” he had said.Meanwhile, Sharad Pawar on Thursday visited Chinchwad assembly constituency in Pune district to campaign for his party’s candidate, Rahul Kalate, who is contesting against BJP’s Shankar Jagtap in the Maharashtra elections on Nov 20. Pawar criticised the current govt, stating that Maharashtra has “fallen into the wrong hands” in recent years, resulting in a decline and stagnation in development.","Pawar Senior made these remarks in an interview with The News Minute- Newslaundry.

AGRA: A bride walked out of her wedding after the groom refused to perform the main rituals unless his demand for Rs 30 lakh dowry was met at the venue. Ravi Kumar, a police constable posted in Agra, was arrested after a case against him was filed by the bride’s father, a sub-inspector posted in Ghaziabad.The dowry demand was allegedly made shortly after the groom’s party arrived and the garland exchange (varmala) ritual was performed. When the bride’s family expressed their inability to give such a huge amount, an argument ensued between the two parties.Realising that her knight in shining armour wasn’t what he had initially shown her to be, the bride refused to marry him, terming his actions unacceptable. Khandauli SHO Rakesh Singh Chauhan said a case under BNS section 352 (intention insult) and sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act was registered against Ravi Kumar.“The groom was arrested, but released on bail later after being served a notice,” said SHO Chauhan.A member from bride’s side said, “Her father had already spent lakhs of rupees on the wedding. Also, household goods and other appliances worth several lakhs of rupees were given. Still, the groom demanded Rs 30 lakh in cash on the wedding night.”","Ravi Kumar, a police constable posted in Agra, was arrested after a case against him was filed by the bride's father.

In the lead-up to

Jharkhand assembly elections

, BJP veteran and former CM

Babulal Marandi

spoke to TOI on key issues shaping the state’s political discourse. Excerpts:

BJP has emphasised the issue of alleged illegal immigration from Bangladesh in regions like Santhal Pargana and Kolhan. Do you think it will impact the polls?

But opposition parties say it is another polarisation ploy of BJP, similar to slogans like ‘batenge to katenge’ and ‘ek hain to safe hain’.

You were the first chief minister of Jharkhand. How do you assess the current situation in the state? Has the separation from Bihar helped the state?

BJP is contesting state polls under you for the first time. But you were out of the party for a long time. How has been the ‘ghar wapsi’ and are you in the race for the CM’s chair?

BJP has accused the

JMM-Congress alliance

of corruption. Do you think it is a factor in polls?

The opposition says that CM Hemant Soren’s arrest was politically motivated. It might harm BJP, by rousing tribal sentiment in favour of Soren.

Congress released its manifesto a day before the first phase of polls. Your reaction?

The demographic changes in Jharkhand, leading to the decline in tribal population, are alarming. From 1951 to 2011, we’ve seen a 10% decrease overall, and a 16% drop in Santhal Pargana.This issue resonates deeply with tribal communities, since it affects not just their cultural identity but also their political and land rights. BJP stands firm as the protector of these rights. The opposition did not just fail to address the issue, it even challenged legal directives for investigation and that speaks volumes about their stance or lack thereof.The call for unity should not be misconstrued as polarisation. Unity among any community, be it for political, social or cultural reasons, is a fundamental right and necessity. BJP advocates unity not to divide but to strengthen our resolve against any form of external influence that could dilute our cultural fabric. The selective outrage towards Hindu unity while ignoring attempts to consolidate other communities, is a confirmation of double standards.Bifurcation has undeniably been advantageous for Jharkhand. It has brought about political empowerment and a focused approach to development. The state has seen significant infrastructural growth, which was severely lacking under the combined governance with Bihar. This has not only uplifted Jharkhand but also influenced development in surrounding regions.Returning to BJP was like coming back to family; despite my absence, the party embraced me with open arms. I was given significant responsibilities, reflecting the trust in me. My aim is to make BJP win, not to fulfil personal political ambitions.Corruption is undoubtedly a central issue in these elections. People are tired of a govt riddled with corruption at every level. The electoral trend so far suggests a yearning for change, which corruption certainly seems to fuel.The arrest was based on corruption charges, not political vendetta. The evidence, including significant cash recoveries and financial irregularities, supports this.The timing and location of the manifesto’s release by Congress seem designed for maximum media attention and possibly to provoke BJP into a reaction. This strategic move, while within the legal bounds, breaches the norms of ethical campaigning, potentially exploiting the model code of conduct for political gains.","Babulal Marandi is a BJP veteran and former chief minister of Jharkhand.

Mumbai is a city of dreams, and Mahayuti will fulfil your dreams, said PM Modi in his last rally for the 2024 Maharashtra polls in Dadar, report Clara Lewis, Prasad Joshi & B B Nayak. He attacked Uddhav Thackeray, saying without naming his party that it had “given its remote control to the Congress”.Modi contrasted the character of the city with what he described as the nature of the Maha Vikas Aghadi. Mumbai was forward-looking and synonymous with development, and Mumbaikars were honest and hardworking, he said, but the MVA was corrupt. He said BJP and Mahayuti have seen a dream — to make Mumbai great. Addressing a mammoth crowd, Modi said, “Give me an opportunity to serve Maharashtra again.”PM Narendra Modi contrasted the character of Mumbai with what he described as the nature of MVA. Mumbai was forward-looking and synonymous with development, and Mumbaikars were honest and hardworking, he said, but MVA was corrupt. He said BJP and Mahayuti have seen a dream — to make Mumbai great. He said that in order to rid the city of connectivity problems, work on projects worth lakhs of crores such as Metro, airport, highways and bridges is happening rapidly.“For decades, Congress govt at the Centre and state did not bother to do forward planning, with the result that Mumbai started regressing. Congress’ signature is corruption, which pushed the country backward and created hurdles in the path of progress. They opposed the Atal Setu as well as the Metro,” he said, adding that while Mahayuti speaks of joining people, Congress speaks of “breaking” people.Addressing a mammoth crowd, Modi said, “I say it with responsibility and humility, aapke sapne hi hamare sankalp hain (Your dreams are our resolutions). Modi aapke sapnon ko jeeta hai, jagta hai unko pura karne ke liye (Modi lives your dreams, stays awake to fulfil them).”“Give me an opportunity to serve Maharashtra again. To fulfil your dreams, I need Mahayuti govt so there are no hindrances,” he added.Mumbai, he said, has for long suffered from terrorism, and people have not forgotten the wounds. “People would travel in fear in trains and buses, unsure if they will return home. In past many years, there is a sense of security. It was the same police but a different govt. Today there is Modi. You need to think why terror acts were regular. There would be announcements on abandoned bags & tiffins. Handlers of terrorists know if they do anything, Modi will not let them go scot free, will get them even from the ends of the world,” he said.He further said, “The Congress’ royal family hates Dalits and backward communities. They want to end SC, ST, OBC unity and cause fights within the communities. The SCs, STs, OBC unity will be destroyed by Congress once it comes to power. It will snatch away your reservation. ‘Ek hain toh safe hain (You are safe if you are one).”In Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, Modi said Congress cannot tolerate an OBC like him being PM for the past 10 years. “Congress believed reservation was against the country. It considered reservation against merit. The party’s mentality and agenda remain unchanged,” he said.In Kharghar, Navi Mumbai, he accused Congress of deliberately keeping the poor in deprivation to maintain political control over them.","Mumbai is a city of dreams, and Mahayuti will fulfil your dreams, said PM Modi in his last rally for the 2024 Maharashtra polls in Dadar.

Similarly, during the tenure of Speaker Alamgir Alam, 324 more were allegedly recruited irregularly while it was alleged that arbitrary promotions were given to many during the tenure of Speaker S S Bhokta.In its appeal, assembly secretariat said, “HC erred in directing CBI to inquire into irregularity of appointments and promotions made in Vidhan Sabha, in absence of criminality or cognisable offence, that too in a civil matter...”",Supreme Court stays a Jharkhand HC order directing CBI probe into alleged recruitment scam in state assembly.

The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections , which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases. The results will be declared on November 23, along with Maharashtra.In the Tribal-dominated state, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and CM Hemant's Soren Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) are in a direct fight, while the Congress party and Lalu Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) are in alliance with the JMM.The JMM-Congress-RJD alliance are also reportedly seeking to deal with Left parties, Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party and other tribal outfits that have been contesting the elections in the state as independent entities and make efforts to field candidates against the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) on all 81 seats collectively.In the last assembly polls in 2019, the JMM-Congress-RJD alliance won a comfortable majority of 47 seats in a House of 81.The BJP slipped to 25 seats from 37 it held in 2014. The poor performance was perceived to be the outcome of its decision to contest alone backfiring. The party did not foster an alliance with the Ajsu in the 2019 polls when Raghubar Das, currently the Odisha governor, was serving the state as CM.In this year's Lok Sabha polls in Jharkhand, the BJP-led NDA secured nine out of the 14 seats, with the BJP winning eight and its alliance partner, the Ajsu (All Jharkhand Students Union) Party, retaining its single seat.On the other hand, the opposition India bloc improved its tally, increasing its seat count from two in 2019 to five in the parliamentary polls.BJP and JMM have spruced up their pace of campaigning from the ground zero to social media. BJP and JMM leaders are actively rebutting and challenging each other on a range of issues, including illegal immigration, youth welfare, employment and housing.INDIA bloc parties in Jharkhand slammed the EC for holding assembly elections in the state along with that of Maharashtra but claimed that they were ready to slug it out with BJP-led NDA, which has welcomed the announcement of poll dates.JMM, Congress, and CPI (ML-L) said the announcement showed that EC was in a hurry to conduct elections though the assembly tenure was due to end in January next year.Also, both the INDIA bloc and BJP-led NDA are expected to get into huddles to discuss the modalities of seat-sharing which is going to be a challenge for both the competing teams.","The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections, which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases. The results will be declared on November 23, along with Maharashtra. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and CM Hemant's Soren Jharkshand Mukti Morcha (JMM) are in a direct fight.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114245990,imgsize-1137124,width-400,resizemode-4/114245990.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra. Elections in Maharashtra will be held in single phase on November 20. The counting of votes will be on November 23.Maharashtra is gearing up for elections as the two major political alliances—the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) and the Mahayuti—prepare to face each other for the first time in a Vidhan Sabha election.The Maha Vikas Aghadi, comprise of the Congress, the Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray), and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) under Sharad Pawar, will go head-to-head with the Mahayuti , which includes the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Shiv Sena faction led by Eknath Shinde, and the NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar. This will be the first electoral contest between these two alliances since the splits within the Shiv Sena and NCP.The MVA is hopeful of replicating its recent Lok Sabha success, while the Mahayuti aims to retain power by leveraging its populist schemes targeted at women and youth. Both alliances have set their sights on winning the state.Narayan Rane, a former Union Minister and the victor in the Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg Lok Sabha constituency, is poised to be a key figure for the BJP in the Konkan region during the forthcoming elections. Meanwhile, two constituencies are expected to be critical battlegrounds: chief minister Eknath Shinde's Kopri-Pachpakdi seat in Thane City and Worli in Mumbai, where Aaditya Thackeray, a leader of the Shiv Sena (UBT), is seeking reelection.In the last Vidhan Sabha elections in 2019, the BJP secured 26.1% of the votes, the Congress 16.1%, the NCP 16.9%, and the Shiv Sena 16.6%. The BJP and the Shiv Sena (then united) formed the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which secured a majority. However, the coalition soon crumbled due to disagreements over government formation, plunging the state into a political crisis.After no party could establish a government, Maharashtra was placed under President's rule. Devendra Fadnavis was briefly sworn in as chief minister, with Ajit Pawar as deputy chief minister. However, both resigned just days later before a scheduled floor test.By November 28, 2019, a new coalition emerged, with the Shiv Sena (Uddhav faction), NCP (Sharad Pawar faction), and Congress forming the Maha Vikas Aghadi government, led by Uddhav Thackeray as chief minister.The state's politics took another turn in June, 2022, when Uddhav Thackeray resigned following a rebellion within the Shiv Sena, led by Eknath Shinde, who then allied with the BJP. Eknath Shinde assumed the role of chief minister, with Devendra Fadnavis returning as deputy chief minister.",The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra. Elections in Maharashtra will be held in single phase on November 20. The counting of votes will be on November 23. This will be the first electoral contest between these two alliances since the splits within the Shiv Sena and NCP.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114248739,imgsize-47642,width-400,resizemode-4/114248739.jpg"

He alleged PM Modi has never read the Indian Constitution. Gandhi also claimed industrialist Gautam Adani played a role in bringing down the MVA government.

NASHIK/CHHATRAPATI SAMBHAJINAGAR: Congress MP Rahul Gandhi Thursday said PM Modi has ""never read the Indian Constitution and, hence, does not know its contents"". The statement came amidst BJP's attack over the red cover of the copy of the Constitution that he carries around at his poll campaign rallies. Rahul held multiple rallies in north Maharashtra and Marathwada Thursday.In a rally at Nanded, the leader of opposition in Lok Sabha alleged that industrialist Gautam Adani played a role in bringing down MVA govt to bag the Dharavi redevelopment project. ""Your govt was stolen and snatched away. Do you think Narendra Modi was not involved? ... Why was Adani sitting in a political meeting? He only attended the meeting because he wanted Dharavi,"" Rahul told the audience, referring to Ajit Pawar's recent comments about a 2019 meeting between undivided NCP and BJP.Addressing another rally in tribal-dominated Nandurbar earlier in the day, Rahul claimed: ""The PM has been criticising me for flaunting a blank, red-coloured copy of the Constitution in my rallies. He has been claiming that the book is bereft of any content. I want to tell the PM that the book's colour is immaterial. Our PM thinks the book is blank because he has never read the Indian Constitution.""",Congress MP Rahul Gandhi held multiple rallies in north Maharashtra and Marathwada.
