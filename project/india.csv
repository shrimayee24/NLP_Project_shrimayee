‘Vote Theft In Bengal’: TMC MP Abhishek Banerjee Slams ECI Over SIR, BJP Fires Back

New Delhi: Supreme Court on Thursday asked the Election Commission to implement in Tamil Nadu the court directed procedure for submission of documents by voters flagged under ‘logical discrepancy’ category during Special Intensive Revision of West Bengal electoral rolls, prompting the EC to request the SC to extend it to all states undergoing SIR of voter lists.A bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi, dealing with petitions by politicians from ruling DMK party, said the names of voters categorised under ‘logical discrepancies’ by EC would be displayed at public places, panchayat and taluk offices along with the reasons for such categorisation and documents required to be furnished by them.“The person receiving the documents from voters would issue a receipt. However, hearing of voters for inclusion of their names in electoral rolls would be conducted at taluka level officers,” the bench said and directed the TN govt to provide adequate staff to the EC to carry out the task. It allowed the voters to submit the documents within 10 days of display of the list by EC.It also asked the DGP, SPs and collectors to ensure no law and order situation emerges to scuttle the SIR exercise. This prompted EC counsel and senior advocate D S Naidu to request the SC to extend the order to all states where SIR of electoral rolls are being carried out.In its order, the bench recorded - “We expect the EC to comply with these directions on a pan-India basis.”In another hearing, the CJI-led bench concluded hearing on the challenge to the constitutional validity of SIR, which was first carried out in Bihar and then extended to 12 other states, after a three month long hearing that saw contrasting arguments put forth by the poll body and petitioners.Appearing for Association for Democratic Reforms, advocate Prashant Bhushan said EC cannot remove a person from the voter list if he/she gives a self-declaration claiming to be an Indian citizen.He said if anyone objects to the citizenship of a voter, then the onus is on the complainant to produce the voter list from Bangladesh to substantiate the accusation of illegal migrants. The bench laughed and said, “You know this is not possible. How will someone get the voter list from Bangladesh containing the name of an alleged illegal migrant figuring in the voter list of an Indian state.”",Supreme Court asks the Election Commission to implement in Tamil Nadu the court directed procedure for submission of documents by voters flagged under ‘logical discrepancy’ category during Special Intensive Revision of West Bengal electoral rolls.

"Assam Congress protests 'vote theft' through Special Revision (SR), slams Himanta",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/assam-congress-protests-vote-theft-through-special-revision-sr-slams-himanta/articleshow/127778499.cms,"Gamosa Controversy Explained: BJP Criticizes Rahul Gandhi At President’S ‘At Home’ Event

GUWAHATI: Opposition Congress on Wednesday held a protest in Assam's Kamrup district against alleged ""vote theft"" through the Special Revision (SR).The protest was organised in front of the office of the Boko–Chaygaon Sub-Divisional Commissioner against actions of BJP workers who allegedly entered the office at night and interfered with the deletion and inclusion of names in the voters' list.Addressing the protesters, Congress MLA Rakibuddin Ahmed criticised the recent remarks made by Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma.""The entire SR process is nothing but a tactic to steal the opposition's votes. The EC is helping the BJP in this game. On the other hand, our CM is making only polarising statements.""For the past 2-3 days, the CM has been repeatedly making statements at public meetings that Miyas should be punished. It is really unfortunate that a CM is making such a statement against one community,"" he added.Ahmed said such remarks were unbecoming of a chief minister and unacceptable as the people concerned have been living in Assam for hundreds of years.""These people are deeply connected with the land, its culture, dignity and unity. The BJP is attempting to create divisions in Assam, and the CM's repeated calls to harass a particular community and to delete their votes are reprehensible and a dangerous sign for democracy,"" he added.After the protest, Congress leaders and workers met the election authorities and demanded strict action against the alleged irregularities.Stating that ""Bangladeshi Miyas"" live in Assam, Sarma on Wednesday said more than five lakh complaints have been filed by BJP workers during the SR process against such ""foreigners"".'Miya' is originally a pejorative term used for Bengali-speaking Muslims in Assam and the non-Bengali speaking people generally identify them as Bangladeshi immigrants. In recent years, activists from the community have started adopting this term as a gesture of defiance.Assam has registered a 1.35 per cent increase in voters according to the integrated draft electoral rolls for the state, published on December 30 after SR was conducted ahead of the Assembly elections.The draft rolls after the SR reflected a total of 2,52,01,624 electors, representing a 1.35 per cent increase from the previous final rolls published in January 2025.A total of 7,86,841 additions and 4,47,196 deletions have taken place from January 6 to December 27 last year.During the SR process, 4,78,992 deceased electors and 5,23,680 shifted electors were identified. Another 53,619 multiple entries were identified.The Election Commission, however, said that these names have not yet been deleted. These will only be processed for removal or shifting after formal applications are received during the current claims and objections period.The final electoral rolls will be published on February 10.","Opposition Congress held a protest in Assam's Kamrup district against alleged ""vote theft"" through the Special Revision (SR) The protest was organised in front of the office of the Boko–Chaygaon Sub-Divisional Commissioner.

'To Remove Corrupt DMK': TTV Dhinakaran Meets Goyal As AMMK Rejoins NDA Ahead Of Tamil Nadu Polls

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Rahul Gandhi and DMK parliamentarian Kanimozhi met on Wednesday for discussions on the Tamil Nadu assembly elections but no agreement was reached on seat-sharing in the state, where the DMK is in power and the Congress is its ally.“It was a pleasant meeting, and no seat-sharing numbers were discussed, but there was an emphasis on showing respect for the Congress,” a party source said, according to PTI.The source added that during the meeting at former Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s 10, Janpath residence in Delhi, her son and Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi told Kanimozhi that the DMK should hold talks with the committee formed by Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge to resolve seat-sharing issues.Congress leaders in Tamil Nadu are reportedly seeking a ""substantial increase"" in the number of seats the party contests in the upcoming assembly elections, along with a ""proper share"" in power. However, the DMK is unwilling to offer more seats than it did in the last election.In 2021, the grand old party contested 25 of the 234 assembly constituencies and won 18.Tamil Nadu chief minister and DMK supremo MK Stalin shares good relations with the Congress leadership and, therefore, the issue is expected to be resolved soon, sources noted.Some state Congress leaders have also discussed the possibility of an alliance with actor Vijay’s newly formed Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK), though the Congress leadership is reportedly keen on contesting the elections with the DMK.The Tamil Nadu assembly elections are likely to be held in April–May.","Congress MP Rahul Gandhi and DMK parliamentarian Kanimozhi met on Wednesday for discussions on the Tamil Nadu assembly elections.
