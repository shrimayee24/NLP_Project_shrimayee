Poll How do you feel about the impact of social media on public perception during crises? It's just noise, doesn't matter much. It greatly influences public opinion.

NEW DELHI: BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla on Sunday lashed out at cricketer-turned-Trinamool Congress MP Yusuf Pathan , amid ongoing violence in West Bengal’s Murshidabad district. Referring to a post on Pathan’s Instagram — where he appears relaxed and sipping tea—Poonawalla questioned the MP’s priorities as the state grapples with unrest.However, Murshidabad—the epicentre of the violence, is represented by Pathan's party colleague, Abu Taher Khan in Lok Sabha, Poonawalla still used the situation to target him and TMC over his social media post. BJP's Poonawalla also used pictures of violence-hit areas in his X post.In a post on X, he wrote: ""Bengal is burning. HC has said it can’t keep eyes closed and deployed central forces. Mamata Banerjee is encouraging such state-protected violence as police stay silent! Meanwhile, Yusuf Pathan—MP—sips tea and soaks in the moment as Hindus get slaughtered… This is TMC.""Later, speaking to ANI news agency, Poonawalla further intensified his criticism: ""Mamata Banerjee has picked up a cricketer named Yusuf Pathan from somewhere and gave him a ticket. The vote bank made him win in Baharampur and today when Bengal is burning, Hindus are being selectively killed, Yusuf Pathan is enjoying sipping tea… This is the priority of TMC.""His remarks came amid heightened tensions in parts of West Bengal, especially in Murshidabad, which has seen violent protests following changes to the Waqf law.At least three people have died and over 150 have been arrested. Several areas, including Malda, South 24 Parganas, and Murshidabad, witnessed arson, stone-pelting, and clashes with security forces.Earlier on Friday, several vehicles were set ablaze and stones were hurled at security forces. Various districts, including Malda, Murshidabad, South 24 parganas were rocked by violence.Authorities have since conducted multiple raids and deployed additional forces to restore order.","BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla lashed out at cricketer-turned-Trinamool Congress MP Yusuf Pathan.
