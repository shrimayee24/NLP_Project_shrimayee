'Only Mistake I Made Was...': Prajwal Revanna Tells Court Before Life Sentence In Rape Case

Poll Do you think protests will effectively change the political situation in Punjab? Yes No





PATIALA: AAP MLA Harmeet Singh Pathanmajra has allegedly escaped police custody while being taken to a local police station after his arrest.According to Punjab Police sources, Pathanmajra and his accomplices fired at police officers during the escape and even ran over one personnel, leaving him injured.According to reports, Pathanmajra and his accomplices ran over police personnel with an SUV.The Sanour MLA was arrested a day after publicly criticising his party’s Delhi leadership.His detention in Patiala was linked to a rape case filed against him, sparking political uproar in the region.In a social media post, Pathanmajra claimed the case related to his former wife and alleged that the fresh charges of rape were politically motivated.“I was booked because I raised my voice against my own government, especially the Delhi leadership,” he wrote.His brother, Hardev Singh, said the MLA was taken into custody under Section 376 of the IPC despite already having been granted bail by the Punjab and Haryana High Court. “He was arrested from Dabri in Haryana in a case where bail was already granted. This is clearly an attempt to silence him,” he alleged.CIA Patiala confirmed that three weapons have been recovered and one accomplice of MLA Pathanmajra has been arrested.The arrested individual has been identified as Balwinder Singh, while the search for MLA Pathanmajra continues.Police said two officers were injured when stones were thrown at them during the MLA’s escape attempt.Authorities added that supporters of the MLA not only pelted stones but also opened fire at the police team.Before his arrest, Pathanmajra had appealed to colleagues and supporters via Facebook to protest outside the Patiala SSP’s office at the Mini Secretariat. He urged people to reach “in tractors, trolleys, and cars” to demand his release. “I will not be silenced even if more cases are registered against me. Will AAP’s Delhi leadership rule Punjabis now? Even Congress and BJP did not interfere to this extent,” he said.The MLA has repeatedly accused the party’s central leadership of sidelining Punjab leaders and “remote-controlling” the state. Recently, he criticised officials of the Irrigation Department over flood relief efforts in his constituency. Soon after, his security cover was withdrawn and police officers in the area were reshuffled — moves that raised eyebrows.“This is retaliation. They looted Punjab more than Abdali. Now they want to sell Punjab,” Pathanmajra declared.","Harmeet Singh Pathanmajra allegedly escaped police custody while being taken to a local police station after his arrest.

Mahua Moitra vs Jai Dehadrai over pet Henry



NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Wednesday asked why Trinamool MP Mahua Moitra and lawyer Jai Anant Dehadrai could not sit together and sort out the issue over their pet Henry. Dehadrai moved a plea before the court challenging a trial court order that restrains him from publicising an ongoing custody battle with Mahua, Bar and Bench reported.As the court sought Mahua Moitra's response on the plea, Justice Majoj Jain asked why the parties could not settle the dog custody dispute out of court. ""Why don't you sit together and sort it out? What relief is she seeking in the suit?"" Justice Jain asked.Advocate Sanjay Ghose, representing Dehadrai, argued that Mahua Moitra seeks shared custody of Henry. He added that Dehadrai is aggrieved by the trial court's March 2025 decision to restrict the parties from talking about the case. The order was passed by a Saket Court in March 2025.Dehadrai contended that the Saket Court order violated his freedom of speech.Mahua Moitra and Jai Dehadrai were reportedly in a relationship and owned Henry, a Rottweiler. As their relationship soured and Dehadrai accused Mahua Moitra of 'cash-for-query', Henry became a central character of their feud with both claiming that Henry belonged to them, and the other party 'kidnapped' him.Dehadrai claimed he purchased Henry for Rs 75,000 and cared for him since he was 40 days old. Mahua Moitra alleged that Dehadrai trespassed into her residence and took Henry.As the custody battle reached the court, the Saket Court order directed both Mahua and Dehadrai to ""ensure that the present proceedings shall not be publicised in any manner."" Dehadrai argued that by such a ""sweeping gag order"", he was restrained from being able to disclose the existence of Moitra's suit to anyone in the public domain. Dehadrai said he had earlier posted on X regarding the case without mentioning any case details.""A frivolous case is filed against me, and I can’t talk about it, I can't discuss about it, I can't write about it? Where is it necessary to the fairness of the trial? She is an MP. Can an MP claim a higher right over a normal plaintiff? And say any case I file will be gagged?"" Ghose argued on behalf of Dehadrai.The Delhi HC has decided to hear the matter next on December 22. It noted that Moitra had not appeared for the hearing today despite being served advance notice. Therefore, the Court issued notice to her and sought her response.","The Delhi HC on Wednesday remarked about the ongoing custody battle between Mahua Moitra and Jai Anant Dehadrai over pet dog Henry.

RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat’s Big Statement: Hindu-Muslim Already One, Muslims Deserve Equal Job Rights

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday granted anticipatory bail to cartoonist Hemant Malviya, accused of sharing “objectionable” cartoons of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Rashtriya Swayam Sangh (RSS) workers on social media.Earlier, on July 15, the top court had given him interim protection from coercive action—a relief that has now been made “absolute.”A bench of Justices Aravind Kumar and NV Anjaria noted that Malviya had already tendered an apology on his Facebook and Instagram accounts. The court, however, allowed police to seek cancellation of his bail if he failed to cooperate with the investigation.Malviya’s counsel, senior advocate Vrinda Grover, informed the bench that her client had not yet been summoned by police. In response, additional solicitor general KM Nataraj said the summons would be issued once evidence collection was complete.The case dates back to May, when police in Madhya Pradesh's Indore registered an FIR against Malviya based on a complaint by RSS worker and lawyer Vinay Joshi. The complaint alleged that the accused's posts hurt the religious sentiments of Hindus, disturbed communal harmony, and tarnished the RSS’s image.On July 3, the Madhya Pradesh high Court had rejected his plea for anticipatory bail, prompting Malviya to approach the apex court.During its July 15 order, the Supreme Court had also voiced concern over the growing number of objectionable posts on social media and emphasized the need for judicial steps to curb the trend.Malviya faces charges under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita—Sections 196 (acts prejudicial to communal harmony), 299 (deliberate acts to outrage religious feelings), and 352 (intentional insult to provoke breach of peace)—along with Section 67-A of the IT Act, which relates to publishing sexually explicit material online.","Hemant Malviya is accused of sharing ""objectionable"" cartoons of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Rashtriya Swayam Sangh (RSS) workers on social media.

PATNA/MADHUBANI: A jail in Madhubani district turned into a wedding venue when an inmate, accused of sexually exploiting his widowed sister-in-law (elder brother's wife), tied the nuptial knot with her on Tuesday. All arrangements for the unusual wedding were made by the jail administration, as staff served as witnesses, while other inmates played ‘baratis' (groom's party).Jail staff said this happened after the accused filed a bail application in the Patna high court, which was granted with a condition that the lower court verify the marriage between the two before accepting the bail bond. Following this directive, the accused submitted an application to the lower court seeking permission for the marriage.Jail superintendent Om Prakash Shanti Bhushan said on Wednesday, the wedding was organised within the jail premises in compliance with the court order, making necessary arrangements for the ceremony.Advocate Gagan Dev Yadav, representing the accused, said that his elder brother — the woman's husband — had passed away in 2022, after which both came closer and began living together.However, a dispute allegedly led the woman to file a complaint against the accused on June 29, 2024, at the local Women's police station, resulting in the judicial custody of the man.He then filed the bail application in the Patna HC. Following its directive, the accused submitted an application to the court of judge Syed Mohammad Fazlul Bari, seeking permission to marry the woman. With the court's approval, the wedding was solemnised in the jail, marking a rare and significant event.","Jail in Madhubani district turned into a wedding venue when an inmate, accused of sexually exploiting his widowed sister-in-law, tied the nuptial knot with her.

MUMBAI: Rumblings appeared in the governing Mahayuti alliance Wednesday on the approach taken to end the Maratha quota agitation in Mumbai, with NCP cabinet minister and OBC politician Chhagan Bhujbal boycotting the Maharashtra cabinet meeting in the wake of rising unrest in the community over the govt resolution (GR) issued Tuesday to quell activist Manoj Jarange's protest.In response to the OBC backlash in different parts of the state, the Maharashtra cabinet on Wednesday decided to set up a sub-committee on OBC issues.To be headed by BJP neta and revenue minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule, the new sub-committee on OBC issues has four members from BJP and two each from Shiv Sena and NCP, including OBC politician Chhagan Bhujbal.Bhujbal told reporters, ""Certain words in the GR have caused doubts among OBC groups. I am speaking to legal experts and lawyers. If required, we will go to the HC or SC in a few days."" He asked OBC groups not to hold public protests, but to be patient. Jarange said, ""The fact that Bhujbal is upset about GR means it is strong. Some people were not consulted, that is why they are angry.""Bhujbal's stand puts him at odds with his own party, NCP led by deputy CM Ajit Pawar, which has a mainly Maratha base. The GR mandates the setting up of village-level committees for Marathas to apply for Kunbi certificates if their ancestors are named in the Hyderabad gazette.It states that the committees will also consider affidavits or testimonies from relatives, clan members or villagers who already possess certificates.Bhujbal told TOI, ""This is wrong. First of all, a committee has no right to change anyone's caste. Secondly, the GR speaks of changing the caste of Marathas to Kunbi. At points, it does not say 'eligible Marathas'. And how can an affidavit by someone in the village or clan be considered proof? What if people are paid to give an affidavit?""",NCP cabinet minister and OBC politician Chhagan Bhujbal boycotts Maharashtra cabinet meeting.
