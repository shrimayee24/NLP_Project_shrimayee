KOLKATA: West Bengal governor C V Ananda Bose has returned the Aparajita bill to the Assembly for reconsideration, citing serious objections raised by the Centre regarding proposed changes to Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), according to a high-ranking Raj Bhavan source.The Centre found that the Aparajita Women and Child (West Bengal Criminal Laws Amendment) Bill, passed in Sept 2024, contains changes in penal provisions for rape under multiple BNS sections, proposing ""excessively harsh and disproportionate"" punishments, sources said.A major point of contention is an amendment to BNS section 64. The state bill increases the punishment for rape from the current minimum of 10 years to either imprisonment for the remainder of the convict's natural life or capital punishment. The ministry of home affairs (MHA) reportedly deemed this as unduly harsh and inconsistent with principles of proportionality.Another change that MHA has objected to involves the removal of BNS section 65, which prescribes stricter penalties for sexual assault of minors. According to sources, Union govt believe scrapping this clause weakens protections for the vulnerable groups and risks diluting the intent behind age-based classifications in rape laws.However, the clause that the Centre found most problematic is the one under section 66, making the death penalty mandatory in rape cases where the victim either dies or is left in a vegetative state.The MHA raised constitutional concerns, arguing that removing judicial discretion in sentencing violated established legal norms and Supreme Court rulings, sources said.State govt, however, said it had received no official communication either from the Centre nor the governor's office about these observations.Earlier, bills similar to Aparajita, like Andhra Pradesh Disha Bill, 2019, and Maharashtra Shakti Bill, 2020 - which had mandatory death penalty for all rape and gang-rape cases - were passed unanimously by state legislatures, but did not get President's assent.Trinamool Congress indicated the party would make it a political issue. TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh said: ""The returning of the Aparajita bill is unfortunate, deplorable and condemnable... This has proved that BJP is unwilling to impose maximum punishment in these cases, as their members are implicated in molestations and rapes.""",West Bengal governor C V Ananda Bose has returned the Aparajita bill to the Assembly for reconsideration.

While the prevailing view is that BJP will pick one from its ranks, perhaps an OBC like, say, Harivansh, a JDU MP is also being talked about as a probable for the trust he has built with the govt in his nearly seven-year term as Rajya Sabha deputy chairman.The vice president is the ex-officio Chairman of the Upper House, a key position in shaping Parliament's proceedings and thus guiding the govt's agenda.

Explosives Found Near Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah's Event Venue In Bengaluru, Major Attack Foiled





BENGALURU/NEW DELHI: A turf war between Karnataka’s top political bosses spilled over into a dramatic public spat in Delhi on Friday, as aides of chief minister Siddaramaiah and his deputy DK Shivakumar clashed inside Karnataka Bhavan, prompting formal complaints and calls for an inquiry.According to multiple sources, the incident involved C Mohan Kumar, special duty ofﬁcer (SDO) to the CM, and H Anjaneya, SDO to the deputy CM.The confrontation reportedly heated up when Mohan Kumar shouted at Anjaneya, threatening to hit him.This was allegedly said in front of other govt staff.Anjaneya filed a formal complaint with the additional resident commissioner (ARC) and Karnataka chief secretary Shalini Rajneesh, seeking action against Mohan Kumar for issuing threats.In his letter, Anjaneya claimed that if he were to meet any “accident”, then Mohan Kumar would be responsible. The officer went on to claim that Kumar has a history of violence with another person also being hit by him.""I was beaten with a shoe and it has hurt my honour and dignity. Conduct a criminal trial against him (Kumar) and give me justice,"" Anjanaya said in his complaint.“I seek a departmental inquiry against Kumar,” he said in his letter.What started as a verbal dispute between the two aides escalated after women employees at Karnataka Bhavan allegedly accused the DCM’s aide of using unparliamentary language and abusive terms in their presence earlier that day.CMO officials claim the situation worsened when Mohan Kumar confronted Anjaneya over his remarks about the women staff.This confrontation soon degenerated into a full-blown verbal brawl between the two SDOs.Later in the evening, the aggrieved women staff reportedly met Siddaramaiah and expressed concern over the behaviour of the DCM’s officer. Following the meeting, the chief minister directed the ARC to examine the complaint and initiate an inquiry, if necessary.","Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah and his deputy DK Shivakumar's aides clashed inside Karnataka Bhavan.

I opened a hotel in Bengaluru where most of the workers were Bengali migrants. There were no Bangladeshis. But if someone is Bangladeshi, they will obviously be identified as Bangladeshi.”He accused the chief minister of politicising the issue. “She wants to create controversy in everything. Nothing is going to happen. Bangla language will remain as it is. Mamata Banerjee has got no monopoly over it. We will put up a strong fight,” he said.Chakraborty also criticised Banerjee’s call to gherao the Election Commission over alleged voter list tampering in Bengal and Bihar.""She (Mamata) has no other option, but this will definitely happen. The Election Commission must act. Fake and bogus voters have to be removed, only then will elections be fair.Even if the Commission is gheraoed, what will that achieve?
