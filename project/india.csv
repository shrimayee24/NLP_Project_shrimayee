Nitish Kumar brought shame to Bihar when he touched feet of PM Modi: Prashant Kishor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nitish-brought-shame-to-bihar-when-he-touched-feet-of-pm-modi-prashant-kishor/articleshow/111004976.cms,"NEW DELHI: Political strategist turned activist Prashant Kishor accused Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar of compromising his integrity by ""touching the feet "" of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to maintain his position of power. Kishor made these allegations while addressing a public meeting in Bhagalpur on Friday as part of his 'Jan Suraaj' campaign.""People ask me why I am now criticising Nitish Kumar, having worked with him in the past. He was a different man back then. His conscience had not been put up for sale,"" said Kishor, who managed Kumar's election campaign for JD(U) in 2015 and formally joined the party two years later.Kishor alleged that Kumar, who is the leader of the state, brought shame to Bihar by showing subservience to PM Modi at a recent NDA meeting in Delhi. ""The leader of a state is the pride of its people. But Nitish Kumar brought shame to Bihar when he touched the feet of Modi,"" he said as quoted by PTI.The accusation comes in the context of the JD(U) securing 12 seats in the recent Lok Sabha polls, making it the second-largest ally of the BJP, which did not achieve a majority on its own. Kishor criticized Kumar for not leveraging his political influence to benefit Bihar, instead focusing on securing his political future with BJP support.""There is so much talk about Nitish Kumar playing a key role in PM Modi's return to power. But how is the Bihar CM leveraging his position? He is not using his clout to ensure benefits for the state. He is touching feet to ensure that he remains in power, with BJP support, even after the 2025 assembly polls,"" Kishor argued.Prashant Kishor first gained prominence in 2014 for managing PM Modi's successful Lok Sabha election campaign. Since then, he has worked with several high-profile politicians, including Mamata Banerjee, Arvind Kejriwal, and Jagan Mohan Reddy, before giving up political consultancy in 2021.","Prashant Kishor accused Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar of compromising his integrity.

into controversy

What is the case about?

NEW DELHI: Karnataka home minister G Parameshwara has a word of advice for state's former chief minister and senior BJP leader B S Yediyurappa , who faces allegation of sexual assault on a minor girl. Yediyurappa , who is believed to be in the national capital, on Friday got temporary relief from Karnataka high court which put a hold on his arrest by Karnataka CID till June 17, the date of next hearing. The court also ordered the former chief minister to appear before CID for questioning.A Bengaluru court had on Thursday issued a non-bailable arrest warrant against Yediyurappa after the senior BJP leader failed to appear for questioning in the case, which was registered under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Posco) Act on March 14 this year.""A warrant has been issued for Yediyurappa. Police will bring him along with them and get all the information related to the case. Then legal action will be taken. There is information that he is in Delhi. He said he would come on Monday, 16th June,"" Parameshwara told reporters on Friday. ""It is good if he comes back soon,"" the Karnataka home minister added.The case has triggered a war of words between the BJP and the Congress. The BJP has claimed political vendetta and has accused the Karnataka government of hatching conspiracy against the saffron party after the Congress's dismal show in Lok Sabha elections.""Shocked by the humiliating defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, Congress leaders are engrossed in hatching one conspiracy after another against the BJP,"" the BJP said.""Previously, the home minister Parameshwara himself had stated that the complaint from the mentally unstable woman was malicious and without merit. It is absurd that the case is being revived after three months,"" the BJP claimed.The Congress, which had sweeped the assembly elections in the state, won 9 out of the 28 Lok Sabha seats in the state while the BJP got 17.The BJP has also claimed that Karnataka government was maligning Yediyurappa to divert attention from corruption charges involving former minister B Nagendra in the Maharshi Valmiki Development Corporation. Nagendra had resigned subsequently.""Why is the government focusing on Yediyurappa ji's only, among 53 complaints filed by the woman, including against her own children and husband? Why plot a sudden arrest three months after the complaint was filed? If Congress leaders in Delhi succumb to such vile, vindictive politics and target Shri Yediyurappa ji, there is no doubt that Congress will be thrown out of Karnataka,"" it added.The Congress has rejected all these allegations.""BJP says so. They had sent the video to FSL, the report should come, right? All checks should be done as per the procedure. Yediyurappa is a senior person and one of the VIPs, so everything should be checked,"" home minister Parameshwara said.The BJP has also alleged that Rahul Gandhi was behind the state government's decision to implicate Yediyurappa.""Congress, resentful towards the BJP, is now attempting to arrest our respected leader BS Yediyurappa, based on a complaint from a mentally unstable woman. This comes after Rahul Gandhi faced court proceedings for spreading misinformation against BJP in Karnataka ,"" the BJP Karnataka said on Thursday in a post on X.However, Parameshwara rejected reports of Rahul's involvement and said, ""No, why will he (Rahul) involve himself in this? There is no use in simply cooking up a story. It is a local issue ... there is no pressure from anyone.""According to police, Yediyurappa has been booked under the Posco Act and Section 354 A (Sexual harassment) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) based on a complaint by the mother of a 17-year-old girl who alleged that he molested her daughter during a meeting on February 2 this year, at his residence in Dollars Colony. The victim's brother had filed a petition in the court earlier this week alleging that though the case was registered on March 14, no progress has been made in the investigation. The petitioner prayed that Yediyurappa should be arrested and interrogated.(With inputs from agencies)",Karnataka home minister G Parameshwara has a word of advice for state's former chief minister and senior BJP leader B S Yediyurappa.

slams BJP-Ajit Pawar tie-up

NCP's claims ignored

The corruption tag

Waiting for Rajya Sabha boost

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra is one of the key states which helped the opposition puncture Prime Minister Modi's claims of ""abki baar, 400 paar"" in the just-concluded Lok Sabha elections. The BJP ended up with just 9 seats, which is less than half of 23, the number of seats it had won in the state 5 years ago. Unfortunately BJP's ""engineered"" allies also failed to contribute to the NDA target.While the split Sena, now the actual Shiv Sena, performed reasonably well, the split NCP, now the official NCP - stares at a tense future. According to news agency IANS, BJP is conducting an internal survey to assess the possibilities of contesting the upcoming assembly elections aloneNCP chief and Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, who had rebelled against his uncle Sharad Pawar and walked out of the party with most of the MLAs and MPs, finds himself in the wilderness after a disastrous showing in Lok Sabha polls. Ajit Pawar 's NCP contested 4 Lok Sabha seats and managed to win only one. Contrast this to the performance of Eknath Shinde , who had rebelled against Uddhav Thackeray, split the Shiv Sena, joined hands with the BJP and went on to become the chief minister of Maharashtra. Shinde's Sena contested 15 seats and won 7 with a strike rate better than the BJP.What's worse - the RSS has come out in the open questioning BJP's wisdom in joining hands with Ajit Pawar. An article in ""Organiser"" magazine, which is linked to the RSS, slammed BJP's move and called it ""unnecessary politicking."" It said the induction of Ajit Pawar's NCP into NDA had reduced the brand value of BJP.""Maharashtra is a prime example of unnecessary politicking and avoidable manipulations. NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar joined BJP though BJP and split SS (Shiv Sena) had a comfortable majority. Sharad Pawar would have faded away in two-three years as NCP would have lost energy with infighting between cousins,"" RSS lifelong member Ratan Sharda said in the article.""Why was this ill-advised step taken? BJP supporters were hurt because they had fought against this Congress ideology for years and were persecuted. In a single stroke, BJP reduced its brand value. After years of struggle to become numero uno in Maharashtra, it became just another political party without any difference,"" he added.The NCP leaders have tried to play down the criticism calling it the personal opinion of the RSS leader. They claim that their alliance with BJP would continue. But the party's reduced bargaining power post elections was evident when PM Modi formed his council of ministers.The NCP is one of the allies who does not have a minister in Modi 3.0. When the contours of the NDA government was being discussed, NCP was the first party to go public with its disappointment over portfolio allocation. Ajit Pawar's party refused to accept minister of state with independent charge post that was being offered for its leader Parful Patel. Pawar said it was a conscious decision taken unanimously as Praful Patel had been a Cabinet minister at the Centre earlier and the offered post would be demotion for him.""I was earlier a Cabinet minister in the Union government, so this will be a demotion for me. We have informed the BJP leadership and they have already told us to just wait a few days, they will take remedial measures,"" Patel had then told reporters.BJP's decision to take Ajit Pawar on board also gave the opposition an opportunity to mock PM Modi over his much-talked about crusade against corruption. This was because the Prime Minister and top BJP leaders had in their earlier rallies accused Ajit Pawar of corruption in the state's irrigation scam.Marginalised after Lok Sabha polls, Ajit Pawar now appears to be waiting for the Rajya Sabha boost to make bigger claims within the NDA. With bulk of NCP MLAs with him, Ajit Pawar will see an increase in the party's tally of MPs in the Upper House. He has already fielded his wife Sunetra Pawar, who had lost Lok Sabha elections to Sharad Pawar's daughter Supriya Sule in Baramati, as NCP candidate for Rajya Sabha elections.Clearly, as BJP now gears up for the assembly elections in the state due later this year, Ajit Pawar may face testing times ahead. Shinde has proved that he will be more valuable as a partner to the saffron party than Ajit Pawar.(With inputs from agencies)",NCP chief and Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar finds himself in the wilderness after a disastrous showing in Lok Sabha polls.

Farage's return to frontline politics and leadership of Reform UK has contributed to the party's rise in popularity.Reform UK's poll rating has increased since Nigel Farage, known for his role in the Brexit campaign, announced his return to frontline politics. Farage has taken over the leadership of the party and is running for a parliamentary seat.In a video posted on X, Farage said, ""This is the inflection point. The only wasted vote now is a Conservative vote. We are the challengers to Labour, and we are on our way.""Reform UK supports tougher immigration laws and other populist causes, resonating with a section of voters. Other polls still show the Conservatives ahead of Reform UK, highlighting the competitive political landscape as the election approaches.Despite the surge, Reform UK, a small right-wing party founded in 2018 as the Brexit Party, is not expected to win many parliamentary seats due to its evenly distributed support across the country.

Irish coalition parties on top after marathon European election counts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/irish-coalition-parties-on-top-after-marathon-european-election-counts/articleshow/110990911.cms,"In Ireland's European parliament elections, Fine Gael and Fianna Fail each secured a modest gain (Photo: TOI)

DUBLIN: Ireland 's two main coalition parties , Fine Gael and Fianna Fail , each won four of the 14 seats contested for the European Parliament after marathon election counts ended on Friday, with the main opposition Sinn Fein trailing both on two seats.

While that represented a one seat gain for Sinn Fein on the last election in 2019, the party had hoped to do much better in the European and local council elections held on the same day, only to get around half the vote of each of their main rivals.

The left wing party was polling as high as 35% in October but its commanding three-year opinion poll lead disappeared ahead of last Friday's elections as more voters came to see immigration as their top concern rather than affordable housing, an issue which Sinn Fein dominated.

It picked up 12% of the first preference vote in the local council elections and 11% in the European polls, which took almost six days to count under Ireland's more complex proportional representation electoral system.

The four seats won by prime minister Simon Harris' centre-right Fine Gael, a member of the largest political family in the European parliament, the European People's Party (EPP), was down one on 2019. Fianna Fail, part of the liberal Renew Europe camp, gained two.

Most of the remaining seats went to independent candidates, a disparate and already large political force in Ireland that also made gains in the local elections.

While no right-wing candidates from Ireland won election to Brussels, bucking a wider trend in the bloc, one high profile anti-immigration candidate polled relatively well in the Irish south constituency and far right candidates won a handful of the 949 council seats, also a gain on five years ago.
