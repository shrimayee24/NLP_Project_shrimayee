CHANDIGARH: In yet another dramatic twist in IPS officer Y Puran Kumar’s alleged suicide, Rohtak police on Wednesday registered an FIR under abetment of suicide and criminal conspiracy charges, naming all those mentioned in the final video of ASI Sandeep Kumar Lather, who allegedly shot himself dead on Tuesday after accusing Puran Kumar of corruption.The FIR (number 305) was registered at Sadar police station in Rohtak a few hours after Haryana chief minister Nayab Singh Saini visited Sandeep’s family in Rohtak’s Ladhot village on Wednesday morning and promised justice. The FIR had not been made public at the time of going to print, but according to highly placed officials, four persons are named in it — the deceased Puran Kumar’s wife Amneet P Kumar, an IAS officer of the 2001 batch, her brother and Punjab AAP MLA Amit Rattan, and head constable Sushil Kumar, who was Puran Kumar’s PSO and is now in jail remand in a corruption case.According to multiple sources, the FIR was registered under BNS Secs 108 (abetment of suicide) and 61 (criminal conspiracy) on a complaint from Sandeep’s wife Santosh.Officials said Virendra Badkhalsa, OSD to the Haryana CM, informed Sandeep’s family about the registration of the FIR on Wednesday evening. Only then did Sandeep’s family agree to an autopsy. Around the same time, Puran Kumar’s body was being cremated in Chandigarh, 230km away, after an eight-day impasse.Sandeep’s body, which the family had kept in a hired freezer, was taken to PGI-MS Rohtak at night. Sandeep was part of the team investigating the case involving Puran Kumar and was also involved in the arrest of Puran Kumar’s former PSO on Oct 5. It was this FIR, registered on Oct 6, that is claimed to be the trigger for Puran Kumar’s suicide as Sushil was alleged to have given a statement that he was demanding money on behalf of Puran Kumar, who was then Rohtak IG. The Haryana govt found itself battling on two fronts. Amneet and other members of the family had refused to allow an autopsy until action was taken against DGP Shatrujeet Kapur and then Rohtak SP Narendra Bijarniya, who were among those named by Puran Kumar in his suicide note.","ASI Sandeep Kumar Lather allegedly shot himself dead on Tuesday after accusing Puran Kumar of corruption.

After Diwali, retailers will get two days to return or safely dispose of unsold stock, ensuring that restrictions are reinstated immediately.Asked about the city markets being flooded with all kinds of firecrackers, Sirsa said the enforcement teams will act against those selling illegally. “Since crackers were banned till now, people were sneaking them in. As green crackers have been allowed now, we will have an organised system,” he said.The Delhi govt will continue monitoring AQI levels from Oct 14 to 25 through DPCC and submit daily reports to CPCB and the Supreme Court in line with the court’s directives.“This Diwali, retailers are also our partners in spreading awareness. They must inform buyers that only green crackers are allowed and explain why the Hon’ble Supreme Court has wisely restricted their use to two hours in the evening and one hour in the morning for two days. This relaxation is temporary, and if Delhi shows discipline and compliance, it can become permanent. Protecting our environment and traditions together is everyone’s collective responsibility,” said Sirsa.","Delhi govt has constituted teams comprising police, Delhi Pollution Control Committee, MCD, and revenue department personnel to ensure action against illegal sellers.

PANAJI: Agriculture minister Ravi Naik, a two-time former chief minister, died early on Wednesday at 79. CM Pramod Sawant toldthat Naik suffered a heart attack at home, and was shifted to a private hospital in Ponda, where he breathed his last. His body was then shifted to his Ponda residence, where people began streaming in to pay their last respects.He is survived by his wife, two sons, daughters-in-law, and three grandchildren. “A stalwart of Goan politics, his decades of dedicated service as CM and minister across key portfolios have left an indelible mark on the state’s governance and people,” said Sawant, who announced three days of state mourning.Naik, a Bhandari leader, had considerable influence in constituencies which have a sizeable population of that community. He was also known for his movement to give rights to kuls and mundkars, and was the first MLA to moot the idea of a third district in Goa.Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his condolences over the demise of Ravi Naik, extending his heartfelt grief to the bereaved family.Ravi was chief minister in 1991 and held the post for around 28 months.During his tenure as CM, Naik acted against rising anti-social elements in the state.He started his political career as a councillor of the Ponda municipal council, and in 1984, he became MLA for the first time from the Ponda constituency on an MGP ticket.

He contested the 2022 assembly election on a BJP ticket from Ponda and secured the seat for BJP for the first time.

BENGALURU: A city-based surgeon was charged with murdering his wife, a Victoria Hospital dermatologist, by administering an overdose of an anaesthetic under the pretext of treating her.The autopsy report from the forensic science laboratory (FSL) completely changed the contours of the case, turning it from one of unnatural death to that of a cold-blooded murder, police said. The victim, Kritika M Reddy, 28, died in April this year, but police arrested the accused, Dr Mahendra Reddy G S, 31, only on Tuesday after the FSL report confirmed the presence of an anaesthetic in the viscera samples of Kritika.The couple was married in March 2024.Accused Mahendra is a surgical resident at the Institute of Gastroenterology Sciences and Organ Transplant (IGOT). He was remanded in seven-day police custody.Sharing details of the case, city police commissioner Seemant Kumar Singh said the FSL report clearly defined the presence of Propofol, an intravenous anaesthetic used to induce unconsciousness for surgery.“We had registered a case of unnatural death. Now, her father, K Muni Reddy, has filed a fresh complaint, accusing his son-in-law of administering an overdose of the anaesthetic to kill the victim,” the police official said.Investigation revealed that Mahendra had moved Kritika to Cauvery Hospital in Marathahalli on April 24, saying she had fallen unconscious at their Munnekolal residence in Whitefield. However, doctors declared her brought dead.As the doctors issued a death memo, autopsy was imperative, but Mahendra pleaded with Cauvery Hospital and police, asking them to refrain from an autopsy. He also made his father-in-law pitch a similar plea to police. Cops, though, went ahead with the autopsy.ACP (east) Ramesh Banoth said: “According to the husband, he was trying to treat his wife who was suffering from gastrointestinal issues for a long time.”According to police sources, Kritika’s ill-health disturbed her husband. “Soon after their marriage, Mahendra discovered that Kritika had several health issues. He was also angry with Kritika’s parents for hiding the truth about her medical condition from him,” an investigating officer said.","Kritika M Reddy, 28, died in April this year, but police arrested the accused, Dr Mahendra Reddy G S, 31, only on Tuesday.
