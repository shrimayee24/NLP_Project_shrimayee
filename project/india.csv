NEW DELHI: The INDIA bloc on Tuesday accused the Election Commission of adding “more than 5,000” voters from Uttar Pradesh to electoral rolls in an adjoining Bihar district to give an advantage to the ruling NDA in the upcoming assembly polls.At a press conference in Phulparas, Madhubani district, Congress national general secretary Randeep Surjewala and RJD MP Manoj Kumar Jha alleged that the “doubtful” voters were mostly registered in the Valmiki Nagar assembly segment of West Champaran district, reported PTI.They cited the case of a 45-year-old man who appeared in Bihar’s rolls despite being an elector of the Khadda constituency in Kushinagar, Uttar Pradesh.The Election Commission rejected the charge, describing the figure as “imaginary” and without evidence.In a statement issued by the West Champaran district administration and shared by the office of the chief electoral officer, officials clarified that “it is a draft electoral roll that has been published by the EC on August 1 and not the final voters' list. The very purpose of draft rolls is to invite claims and objections with regard to duplications or any other discrepancies.”The administration further said, “Moreover, in the press conference, the figure of more than 5,000 doubtful voters has been bandied about without any further details or evidence. It seems to be an imaginary figure which does not lend itself to verification.”It explained that in Valmiki Nagar, changes in the course of rivers often force residents to shift their addresses, which sometimes leads to multiple registrations. “The special intensive revision is aimed at removing such discrepancies,” the statement noted.On the case of Chhedi Ram, the Khadda voter named by Surjewala and Jha, the administration clarified that his name was included in the draft rolls but “he has already moved an application for deletion of his name” from the UP constituency.","The Election Commission rejected the charge, describing the figure as “imaginary” and without evidence.

Is there merit in this criticism against ED?

What SC had said about ED

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah 's ""morality pitch"" to back the Constitution (130th Amendment) Bill, 2025 met a strong counter from Rajya Sabha member Kapil Sibal who accused the Modi government of ""weaponising"" laws to target the opposition.""I don't think in the history of India, there has been a government which is more constitutionally immoral than this government. Can the home minister talk about constitutional morality after the way the governments in Maharashtra, Uttarakhand, Karnataka, Goa and Madhya Pradesh, among other places, were toppled,"" Sibal claimed. ""You can fool some people sometimes but you cannot fool all the people all the time,"" the Independent Rajya Sabha member added.On the last day of the Monsoon Session of Parliament, Amit Shah had introduced the Constitution (130th Amendment) Bill - which proposes automatic removal of Prime Minister, chief ministers and ministers if they are arrested and detained for 30 consecutive days on charges punishable by five years or more imprisonment. The three bills - Government of Union Territories (Amendment) Bill 2025; the Constitution (One Hundred And Thirtieth Amendment) Bill 2025; and the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation (Amendment) Bill 2025 - were referred to a Joint Parliamentary Committee.Amit Shah strongly defended the bills stating they were aimed at upholding ""constitutional morality"" and public trust. The Union home minister also emphasised that the bills, would apply equally to all leaders, including those from the ruling party.However, his assurances failed to convince the opposition. Sibal reacted sharply to Shah's remarks and claimed that ""constitutional morality has nothing to do with their own morality"" and has everything to do with the morality of the opposition.""I was surprised by the home minister’s (Amit Shah) remark that the bill was introduced for morality. The home minister should stop talking about morality and tell the public if any BJP government minister has been arrested and jailed even for a day,"" he said.Earlier, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge had alleged that the BJP planned to use the Bills to engage in ""satta chori"" so that it could ""topple opposition governments within 30 days"" and ""destabilise"" democracy by using arrest as a weapon.So, why is the opposition against the proposed legislation?The opposition claims the proposed law can be used as a tool to bring down non-BJP governments. Sibal claimed that no minister in the BJP governments at the Centre or in states have been arrested in the last 10 years while probe agencies had targeted opposition leaders one after the another.The former Union law minister cited the examples of AAP leaders Arvind Kejriwal, Satyendar Jain and Manish Sisodia, the Congress' P Chidambaram, D K Shivakumar and Alamgir Alam, and JMM's Hemant Soren, among others, saying they had been arrested for over a month and then got bail much later, with the trial not concluding even after years.""No trial is complete. The home minister knows that when the PMLA and CBI get after them, nobody is granted bail. Even the Supreme Court had remarked -- why trial courts are not granting bail. And in the meantime, your political career is destroyed. The whole purpose of these laws is to weaponise laws for destabilising governments of opposition parties,"" Sibal alleged.NCP (SP) leader Rohit Pawar fears the Bill would be misused to target politicians of opposition parties. ""The government uses investigative agencies like the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for political vendetta rather than genuine anti-corruption efforts. There are many BJP leaders on whom we have proved corruption, but the government is doing nothing about it,"" the NCP(SP)leader says and adds: ""98 per cent of the ED's actions are targeted against the opposition. It's no longer an independent body, it’s working on behalf of the government. It was expected to work against corruption across the board, not just the opposition,"" the NCP(SP) leader said.Pending cases against non-BJP ministers and ex-chief ministers:Sibal cited these examples to slam Amit Shah’s claim of speedy justice in matters related to jailed ministers.In March this year, the Union government had informed Parliament that the ED had registered 193 cases against political leaders over the past ten years. Of these, just two cases led to convictions, while no case resulted in an acquittal on merits.https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/only-2-convictions-in-193-ed-cases-against-politicians-in-10-years-centre/articleshow/119217677.cmsAccording to the data, the highest number of such cases, 32, were lodged between April 2022 and March 2023. The second highest, 27, were recorded between April 2020 and March 2021, and again between April 2023 and March 2024. Additionally, 26 cases were registered in both 2019-2020 and 2021-2022.The government, however, denied any vendetta and said: ""The financial crimes probe agency takes up cases “based on credible material and not political affiliations, religion or otherwise.”The Supreme Court had earlier this year made some very strong observations about the functioning of the Enforcement Directorate. The top court had reminded the central agency that it must function strictly within the bounds of the law and said: ""You can’t act like a crook.""Highlighting concerns about the agency’s low conviction rate, Justice Ujjal Bhuyan had said: ""You can't act like a crook, you have to act within the four corners of the law. I observed in one of my judgments that ED has registered around 5,000 ECIRs (enforcement case information report) in the past five years but the conviction rate is less than 10 per cent. We are also concerned about ED’s image. After 5–6 years of custody, if people are acquitted, who takes responsibility?”While the government's intent of not allowing politicians to run governments from jail is indeed praiseworthy, the track record of investigative agencies, especially the ED, gives credence to opposition claims that the proposed legislation will be used to target them. What's more - the opposition claims that the BJP can use these Bills to target even its allies - Chandrababu Naidu and Nitish Kumar - in future.(With inputs from agencies)","The opposition claims the proposed law can be used as a tool to bring down non- BJP governments. Rajya Sabha member Kapil Sibal accused the Modi government of ""weaponising"" laws to target the opposition. Amit Shah strongly defended the bills stating they were aimed at upholding ""constitutional morality"" and public trust.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123528749,imgsize-1154950,width-400,resizemode-4/123528749.jpg"

Delhi Polls: Kejriwal Attacks Election Commissioner; Shah Says People Will Sweep AAP Out With Broom

NEW DELHI: Former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday shot off a barbed response to Union home minister Amit Shah ’s recent interview, in which the BJP leader defended the government's 130th constitutional amendment bill.The bill proposes the removal of lawmakers detained or arrested for more than 30 days in cases carrying a punishment of five years or more.In the interview with news agency ANI, Shah asked if it was ""fair for ministers, chief ministers or even the prime minister—accused of corruption or facing charges with more than five years’ punishment -- to run the government from jail?""Responding to the Union home minister's question, Kejriwal posed a counter question asking: ""And what about a leader who inducts hardened criminals into his party, helps them wipe off their cases, and then rewards them with positions like minister, deputy chief minister, or even chief minister—should such a minister or prime minister not also be forced to step down? How many years of imprisonment should such a person face?""The AAP convenor further asked: ""Finally, if someone is falsely implicated in a case, sent to jail, and later acquitted, how many years of jail should the minister responsible for framing that false case get?""Kerjiwal had refused to step down as Delhi CM when he was jailed over the alleged scam linked to the scrapped Delhi liquor policy and continued to serve as chief minister from Tihar jail.Referring to the incident, Shah said: ""When the constitution was made, the constitution makers would not have imagined such shamelessness that any CM would go to jail and remain the CM from jail.""Shah said Kejriwal continued to serve as CM as the Delhi high court ruled that there was no provision in the law to remove him from the post.""When the case went to the high court, it was argued that Arvind Kejriwal should resign because he is in jail.The high Court said that we believe that he should resign on moral grounds but there is no provision in the current law. My party believes, the Prime Minister of the country believes that no CM, minister or PM in this country can run the government while being in jail,"" the Union home minister said.Kejriwal attacked Amit Shah over his statement, saying his 160-day government from jail was better than the current BJP-led Delhi government.""When the Centre conspired to frame me in false cases and sent me to jail, I ran the government for 160 days from behind bars. In the past seven months, the BJP government in Delhi has dragged the city into such a mess that people now recall those jail days of governance. At least back then, the power and water were available, medicines were free in hospitals and mohalla clinics, medical tests were free, one spell of rain didn’t throw the city into chaos, and private schools weren’t given a free hand to extort and bully parents,"" the ex-Delhi CM said.BJP's national spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla lashed out at Kejriwal over his remark, saying: ""During Covid we worked from home. Now they want 'Work from Jail' for the 1st time in India. Can a CM hold meetings from prison? Where will public hearings be held — inside jail rooms? How will we cope if their is any emergency? This fails both on morality and practicality.""In the interview, Shah also expressed confidence that the Constitution (130th Amendment) Bill, 2025, will be passed, despite the opposition's fierce criticism.Shah said it's aimed at upholding ""constitutional morality"" and public trust, emphasising that the bill would apply equally to all leaders, including those from the ruling party.""I am sure it will be passed. There will be many people in the Congress party and in the opposition who will support morality and maintain the moral ground,"" he said.""The Prime Minister himself has included the post of PM in this... Earlier, Indira Gandhi had brought the 39th amendment (of protecting the President, VP, PM, and Speaker from judicial review by Indian courts)...Narendra Modi ji has brought a constitutional amendment against himself that if the Prime Minister goes to jail, he will have to resign,"" Shah added.Currently, the bill has been referred to a JPC for detailed scrutiny, comprising 31 members from both houses of Parliament. The committee will examine the bill and provide recommendations before it is put to vote.","Union home minister Amit Shah asked if it was ""fair for ministers, chief ministers or even the prime minister"" to run the government from jail. Shah also expressed confidence that the 130th Amendment Bill, 2025, will be passed. The bill proposes the removal of lawmakers detained or arrested for more than 30 days.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123500334,imgsize-40484,width-400,resizemode-4/123500334.jpg"

'Talks Are On With...': Rahul’s Wedding Remark After Tejashwi’s Tip Sparks Political Banter In Bihar

Poll Do you believe the government's response to the SSC protests was justified? Yes, they acted appropriately No, it was excessive

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday hit out at the Centre over the alleged lathicharge on Staff Selection Commission (SSC) aspirants and trainers protesting at Delhi’s Ramlila Maidan. He accused the Modi government of ignoring the concerns of the youth, alleging it had come to power by “stealing votes. ”In a post in Hindi on X, Gandhi said the lathicharge on SSC aspirants and teachers peacefully protesting at Ramlila Maidan was “not just shameful, but the hallmark of a cowardly government.”The protest, held on Sunday, saw the participation of several SSC candidates and their trainers, who were demanding transparency and better conduct of recruitment examinations. The SSC exams have faced repeated complaints of abrupt cancellations, server crashes, unresponsive systems and exam centres located as far as 500 kilometres from candidates’ homes.“The youth had only demanded their rights — employment and justice. What did they get? Lathis,” Gandhi said.He alleged that the government first manipulated elections to secure votes, then allowed irregularities in examinations, followed by failures in providing jobs and ultimately sought to suppress citizens’ rights and voices.The Congress leader further said the government does not prioritise the demands of youth, farmers, the poor, Dalits and minorities, as it does not depend on their votes. He urged people not to be afraid but to stand firm and fight back.Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge also condemned the alleged police action, claiming the Modi government had made it a “habit” to jeopardise the future of the youth.“Stealing the future of the country’s youth has become a habit of the Modi government. The brutal lathi-charge by the Modi government’s puppet police on students protesting against rigging in SSC exams at Delhi’s Ramlila Maidan is highly condemnable,” Kharge said in a post on X.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra too criticised the government, calling the use of force on protesting students “inhuman and shameful.”In her post on X, she said, “The youth of the entire country are troubled by rigging in every exam, scams in every recruitment and paper leaks. The corruption in the recruitment process and exams under the BJP rule is ruining the future of the youth.”Denying the allegations, a senior Delhi Police officer said around 1,500 protestors had gathered at the site, and about 100 refused to leave after the permitted time despite repeated requests.“Out of those who were not leaving, 44 protestors were detained. There was no lathi-charge,” the officer clarified.The SSC is a statutory body responsible for conducting recruitment examinations for various posts across ministries, departments and other government organisations.The Phase 13 exam, held between July 24 and August 1 at 194 centres in 142 cities, faced multiple disruptions. Approximately five lakh candidates appeared for the examination during this period.These issues sparked widespread protests across Delhi last week, drawing thousands of aspirants to the streets and triggering a strong backlash on social media.",Rahul Gandhi hits out at the Centre over the alleged lathicharge on Staff Selection Commission (SSC) aspirants and trainers protesting at Delhi’s Ramlila Maidan.
