Eknath Shinde: Will Shinde retain his hold on home turf?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-shinde-retain-his-hold-on-home-turf/articleshow/114267731.cms,"Will Shinde retain his hold on home turf?

In the broader Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) beyond Mumbai, which is the backbone of Maharashtra ’s economy and a vibrant urban centre, stakes are high for both the Mahayuti and the MVA but especially so for CM Eknath Shinde as his home turf of Thane is part of it. The region is witnessing an intense tussle for seats within the Mahayuti with BJP , while acknowledging the CM’s position, not wanting to concede seats to the Shinde-led Shiv Sena in Thane which it has fought earlier.The MMR, spread over Mumbai, Thane, Palghar and Raigad districts, has 65 assembly seats, of which 36 are in Mumbai. In 2019, BJP won 16 seats in Mumbai and 10 in the rest of MMR. The undivided Shiv Sena on the other hand won 14 seats in Mumbai and seven in the rest of MMR.The four seats within Thane considered the dominion of CM Shinde, have become the centre of attention for assembly polls as the two Shiv Senas will try their best to capture these. At present UBT Sena doesn’t have any representation in these four seats — Ovala Majiwada (Pratap Sarnaik-SS), Kopri-Panchpakhadi (Eknath Shinde-SS), Thane (Sanjay Kelkar-BJP) and Mumbra Kalwa (Jitendra Awhad-NCP SP), all of which are located within the Thane civic corporation limits.Thane Sena (UBT) neta and ex-MP Rajan Vichare said the party was confident of a turnaround in the assembly results as the public has witnessed “betrayal” by their rivals (Shinde) and “rampant corruption in Thane corporation controlled by Mahayuti.”“Thane corporation in their (Shinde Sena) tenure has become a hotbed of corruption. Their own ally (BJP MLA Sanjay Kelkar) has consistently raised questions and alleged corruption in TMC. The corporation was once financially stable but has to rely on state grants every month. Voters have also not liked how they (Shinde) used Anand Digheto to polish their own image in the recently released Dighe biopic sequel. People will teach these ‘traitors’ a lesson in the polls,” he added.However, Shinde Sena is not just basking in the 2024 Thane & Kalyan (from where CM Shinde’s son Shrikant won) LS victory but says it is banking on initiatives taken by its leader Shinde during his tenure as the chief minister.“The LS poll results have shown the affiliation of residents towards Shinde saheb. Anyone can see the works done during his tenure as CM. We are confident that the goodwill will help us not just in Thane but across the state. The opposition has been trying to politicise certain issues, but people are intelligent enough to see through their words,” said Sena MP Naresh Mhaske.A BJP said every party will hold the seats it has won in the last state polls. “There is no conflict on this issue. Recently Dipesh Mhatre, who has been close to MP Shrikant Shinde, quit the Shinde Sena and joined Shiv Sena (UBT) as he wants to contest from Dombivli where PWD minister Ravindra Chavan is sitting BJP MLA. It was clear he would not get the seat,” said the source.On BJP increasing its seat share in MMR, the source said in Palghar, BJP is keen to contest on Dahanuwon by CPI-M’s Vinod Nikole in the last polls. “The other seat it is eyeing is Mira-Bhayandar won by Independent candidate, Geeta Jain,” said the source. Chavan has also been aggressive about expanding the party in Thane, in particular in the KalyanDombivli-Ulhasnagar belt.Another source said that with the BJP keen to fight more seats in Mumbai, Shinde could demand more seats in Thane and beyond, which are his strongholds. “Already BJP neta in Navi Mumbai Ganesh Naik is unhappy about Shinde trying to make inroads into Navi Mumbai,” the source said.BJP is also trying to expand in the Palghar district. “Its MP candidate Dr Hemant Savra won a decisive victory despite the opposition to Vadhavan port. The party has a voter base among Gujaratis, Hindi-speaking migrants from Uttar Pradesh and a section of the Marathi populace. It may reach an understanding with Hitendra Thakur’s Bahujan Vikas Aghadi,” the source explained.","Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) has 65 assembly seats, of which 36 are in Mumbai.

NEW DELHI: The Mumbai police have revealed that the plot to assassinate NCP leader and former Maharashtra minister Baba Siddiqui had started three months ago. The accused had visited Baba Siddiqui's residence multiple times without carrying any weapons, as per the Mumbai police.Based on the information obtained from the Mumbai Crime Branch, the entire plot to murder Baba Siddiqui was orchestrated in Pune.The Mumbai Crime Branch has recorded statements from over 15 individuals, including several eyewitnesses who were present at the scene of the incident.In connection with the murder of NCP leader Baba Siddique, the Mumbai Police has taken another individual into custody, alleging that he supplied funds and weapons for the crime. Harishkumar Balakram Nisad (23), originally from Bahraich in Uttar Pradesh, is the fourth person to be arrested in the case. On Tuesday, a court remanded him to police custody until October 21.""Nisad worked as a scrap dealer in Warje area of Pune city,"" said a police official. A team from the Mumbai crime branch apprehended him in Bahraich on Monday.Previously, the police had arrested Gurmail Baljit Singh (23) from Haryana, Dharmaraj Rajesh Kashyap (19) from Uttar Pradesh, both alleged shooters, and ""co-conspirator"" Pravin Lonkar from Pune.Shivkumar Gautam, another suspected shooter who also hails from Bahraich, remains at large.During Nisad's appearance before additional chief judicial magistrate V R Patil, the police informed the court that he had provided financial assistance to the co-accused and that further investigation was required to establish ""the upper link and lower link"" regarding the financial support and determine how he procured the weapons used in the crime.Nisad and Kashyap are from the same village as the wanted accused, Shivkumar Gautam.Ajay Dubey, Nisad's lawyer, opposed the remand plea, arguing that the accused was a ""victim of circumstances and a scapegoat."" However, the magistrate acknowledged the seriousness of the offence and deemed his custodial interrogation necessary.According to the police, Nisad, along with Kashyap, Gautam, Pravin Lonkar, and Pravin's brother Shubham, was involved in the conspiracy to kill Siddique.On Saturday night, Baba Siddique (66), a former Congress leader who had recently joined the Nationalist Congress Party, was ambushed by three individuals in Mumbai's Nirmal Nagar area, just outside the office of his MLA son Zeeshan Siddique , and shot.The Mumbai crime branch has assembled various teams to apprehend Shivkumar Gautam, accused Mohammed Zeeshan Akhtar, and other individuals wanted in connection with the case.According to officials, the crime branch is exploring various angles, including the possibility of a contract killing, business or political rivalry, or threats related to a slum rehabilitation project.","Harishkumar Balakram Nisad (23), originally from Bahraich in Uttar Pradesh, is the fourth person to be arrested in the case.

BJP vs Hemant Soren in Jharkhand

NEW DELHI: The countdown for the high-stakes assembly elections in Maharashtra and Jharkhand has begun with the Election Commission on Tuesday announcing dates for voting in the two states. While Maharashtra will vote on November 20, Jharkhand will see two-phase polling on November 13 and 20. The results for both the states will be out on November 23.After registering convincing victories in Odisha, Arunachal Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh and riding on the back of its impressive show in Haryana, the BJP-led National Democractic Alliance (NDA) will go all out to end the year 2024 on a winning note.The opposition INDIA (Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance) bloc, on the other hand, would hope that Haryana shocker was just a Congress-inflicted hiccup and it won't wash away their Lok Sabha gains.The Maharashtra electoral battle is all set to be one of the keenest this year. The state's politics has seen a lot of turbulence in the last 5 years - with allies becoming political foes and parties splitting down in the middle leading to changed power equations. There is a lot at stake for both the ruling Mahayuti and opposition's Maha Vikas Aghadi.The BJP and the undivided Shiv Sena had contested the 2019 assembly election as allies and had won a decisive mandate. The BJP had won 105 seats and the Shiv Sena 56. However, fight over the chief minister's post saw Uddhav Thackeray quit the NDA and join hands with NCP and Congress to form the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA). The MVA went on to form the government under Uddhav's leadership.In June 2022, Eknath Shinde led a rebellion against Uddhav Thackeray and walked out of the party with most of the MLAs. He joined hands with the BJP to become the chief minister of Maharashtra and eventually got recognition as the orginal Shiv Sena. A year later, Sharad Pawar's NCP met with the same fate with his nephew Ajit Pawar leading the rebellion. The NCP also split eventually and Ajit Pawar joined the ruling Mahayuti as deputy chief minister.The 2024 Lok Sabha elections was the first electoral contest in the state after the changed power equations in the state. And the verdict was decisively in favour of the Maha Vikas Agadhi which won 30 out of the 48 Lok Sabha seats in the state. The Lok Sabha results gave the MVA both hope and confidence of defeating the Mahayuti again in the assembly elections. But as the Haryana elections show, Lok Sabha success is no guarantee of victory in state elections. The Eknath Shinde government has taken a leaf out of Nayab Singh Saini's success story template and has gone on an overdrive to woo all sections ahead of the assembly elections. Whether it can replicate Haryana BJP's success story or not we will know on November 23.The MVA will also hope to learn important lessons from the Haryana mandate - including the consequences of division of votes against the BJP. Confident after their Lok Sabha success, the three MVA allies have been struggling to arrive at a seat-sharing deal - with each party trying not to concede too much of space. The Haryana results have surely dampened Congress's spirits and the party may have lost some of its bargaining powers. The Maharashtra results will be important for the future of not just MVA but also the INDIA bloc, which has struggled to stay intact.In Jharkhand, the BJP-led NDA, which has been in the opposition for the last five years, will faceoff with a confident Hemant Soren-led opposition alliance. The BJP has four former chief ministers in its ranks. Ironically though, the party's campaign in the state is being spearheaded by Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and Union minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. They have gone hammer and tongs on the issue of Bangladeshi infiltrators threatening the existence of tribals in the state and their promise of implementing the NRC. While these issues may resonate in some of the districts bordering Bengal, it remains to be seen how much of an impact it makes in the rest of the state.Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren, on the other hand, has played his cards well till now. He has managed to return as chief minister after having to quit the post for a short jail term after the ED arrested him in an alleged money laundering case related to land scam. However, Soren has managed to use the case and the jail term to play the victim card and accuse the BJP of targeting him because he is a tribal. The Congress in the state lacks mass leaders and also a strong leadership and hence would continue to play second fiddle to the JMM.In the last assembly elections, the BJP lost despite leading a government in the state for five years. While the BJP could win only 25 seats, the JMM emerged as the single largest party with 30 assembly seats and went on to form the government with the help of its allies including the Congress. The JMM-led INDIA bloc made some gains in the Lok Sabha elections as well winning 5 out of the 14 Lok Sabha seats. It will hope to consolidate these gains further and return to power in the state.The results of Maharashtra and Jharkhand assembly elections will decide which of the two alliances take the pole position as they brace for the 2025 electoral battles starting from Delhi. A win for the BJP will further consolidate its Haryana gains while a win for the INDIA alliance will help the opposition bloc emerge from its Haryana shock.","The Election Commission on Tuesday announced dates for voting in the two states.

"Maharashtra polls on November 20, Jharkhand votes on November 13, 20",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maharashtra-polls-on-november-20-jharkhand-votes-on-november-13-20/articleshow/114266953.cms,"Midweek polling day to ensure voters don’t choose to travel: EC



NEW DLEHI: Election Commission Tuesday set the stage for another mouth-watering contest between BJP and its allies and their Congress-aligned rivals, announcing single-phase polls in Maharashtra on November 20 and two-phase voting on November 13 and 20 to elect the new Jharkhand assembly. Counting for both states, as well as 48 assembly and 2 Lok Sabha bypolls will be held November 23.The twin contests are crucial for both sides, with BJP keen to build upon the advantage it gained after a stunning victory in Haryana and Congress and its allies looking to regain the momentum from their im- proved LS performance.The two parliamentary bypolls are in Kerala’s Wayanad, from where Priyanka Gandhi will contest her first election, and Nanded in Maharashtra, which fell vacant after the death of sitting MP Vasant Chavan. While polling for 47 assembly seats and Wayanad will be held on November 13, the assembly seat of Kedarnath and Nanded LS constituency will vote on November 20.Bypolls due in Basirhat in Bengal and Milkipur in UP were not announced in view of pending election petitions. The vastly altered political landscape of Maharashtra since the last polls, with Shiv Sena and NCP splitting and Uddhav’s Sena leaving BJP to join forces with Congress makes the current contest an absorbing affair.In Jharkhand, the imprisonment of CM Hemant Soren and his dramatic comeback has sharpened the tribal versus non-tribal faultline, bringing a sharper edge to what should have been a traditional incumbent versus challenger showdown.“Elections are a festival of democracy and voters’ enthusiastic participation is desired and requested. We also appeal to the candidates to campaign fearlessly while honouring model code of conduct,” chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar, who was flanked by election commissioners Gyanesh Kumar and S S Sandhu, said at a press conference to announce the poll schedule.The latest assembly polls come close on the heels of BJP making history by winning a third straight term in Haryana, dashing Congress’s hopes of voting it out based on what it had wrongly gauged a s a strong anti-incumbency sentiment. Congress’s alliance with National Conference did win J&K polls, but it was the latter’s show all the way with the national party contributing just six seats to the combine’s 48-seat tally.BJP-Shiv Sena-NCP alliance had suffered reverses in Maharashtra LS polls, managing just 17 of the state’s 48 seats, even as the alliance between Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray) and NCP (Sharad Pawar) put up an impressive performance with 31 seats. This followed splits in both Shiv Sena and NCP midway through the five-year term, which enabled the BJP-led coalition comprising the breakaway factions to dislodge the Thackeray govt in 2022.BJP will look to turn things around in Maharashtra and wrest back Jharkhand from the JMM-led alliance, which has been saddled with corruption charges. In Lok Sabha polls earlier this year, BJP had bagged eight of the 14 seats in Jharkhand, while JMM and Congress managed three and two seats respectively.As many as 9.6 crore voters in Maharashtra, which includes 20.9 lakh first-time voters aged 18-19 years and 1.8 crore voters aged 20-29 years, will vote across 288 constituencies. In Jharkhand, 2.6 crore voters, including 11.8 lakh first-time voters, will vote across 81 constituencies.The poll schedule takes into account multiple festivals crowding Nov, including Diwali, Chhath and Dev Deepawali. EC scheduled the polls towards the end of the second week of November to give enough time for migrant voters from Bihar to be done with Chhath festivities and related travel to their hometowns.CEC said Wednesday was deliberately chosen for both polling days as it falls in the middle of the week and would make sure that voters don’t choose to travel out by clubbing the poll-day holiday with the weekend.For the second time, EC has restricted the phases in a state seen as a security challenge. After winding up J&K polls in three phases, the commission has carried the trend forward by bringing down phases in Jharkhand, affected by Left-wing extremism, to just two from five in 2019. This was made possible by the Centre’s decisive push to tackle Left-wing extremism in Jharkhand by liberating several areas of the state from the hold of Maoists.","Election Commission announces single-phase polls in Maharashtra on November 20.

Events Date Phase 1 voting November 13 Phase 2 voting November 20 Results November 23

The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections , which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases. The results will be declared on November 23, along with Maharashtra.In the Tribal-dominated state, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and CM Hemant's Soren Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) are in a direct fight, while the Congress party and Lalu Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) are in alliance with the JMM.The JMM-Congress-RJD alliance are also reportedly seeking to deal with Left parties, Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party and other tribal outfits that have been contesting the elections in the state as independent entities and make efforts to field candidates against the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) on all 81 seats collectively.In the last assembly polls in 2019, the JMM-Congress-RJD alliance won a comfortable majority of 47 seats in a House of 81.The BJP slipped to 25 seats from 37 it held in 2014. The poor performance was perceived to be the outcome of its decision to contest alone backfiring. The party did not foster an alliance with the Ajsu in the 2019 polls when Raghubar Das, currently the Odisha governor, was serving the state as CM.In this year's Lok Sabha polls in Jharkhand, the BJP-led NDA secured nine out of the 14 seats, with the BJP winning eight and its alliance partner, the Ajsu (All Jharkhand Students Union) Party, retaining its single seat.On the other hand, the opposition India bloc improved its tally, increasing its seat count from two in 2019 to five in the parliamentary polls.BJP and JMM have spruced up their pace of campaigning from the ground zero to social media. BJP and JMM leaders are actively rebutting and challenging each other on a range of issues, including illegal immigration, youth welfare, employment and housing.","The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections. The elections will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases. The results will be declared on November 23, along with Maharashtra.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra. Elections in Maharashtra will be held in single phase on November 20. The counting of votes will be on November 23.Maharashtra is gearing up for elections as the two major political alliances—the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) and the Mahayuti—prepare to face each other for the first time in a Vidhan Sabha election.The Maha Vikas Aghadi, comprise of the Congress, the Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray), and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) under Sharad Pawar, will go head-to-head with the Mahayuti , which includes the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Shiv Sena faction led by Eknath Shinde, and the NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar. This will be the first electoral contest between these two alliances since the splits within the Shiv Sena and NCP.The MVA is hopeful of replicating its recent Lok Sabha success, while the Mahayuti aims to retain power by leveraging its populist schemes targeted at women and youth. Both alliances have set their sights on winning the state.In the last Vidhan Sabha elections in 2019, the BJP secured 26.1% of the votes, the Congress 16.1%, the NCP 16.9%, and the Shiv Sena 16.6%. The BJP and the Shiv Sena (then united) formed the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which won a majority. However, the coalition soon crumbled due to disagreements over government formation, plunging the state into a political crisis.After no party could establish a government, Maharashtra was placed under President's rule. Devendra Fadnavis was briefly sworn in as chief minister, with Ajit Pawar as deputy chief minister. However, both resigned just days later before a scheduled floor test.By November 28, 2019, a new coalition emerged, with the Shiv Sena (Uddhav faction), NCP (Sharad Pawar faction), and Congress forming the Maha Vikas Aghadi government, led by Uddhav Thackeray as chief minister.The state's politics took another turn in June, 2022, when Uddhav Thackeray resigned following a rebellion within the Shiv Sena, led by Eknath Shinde, who then allied with the BJP. Eknath Shinde assumed the role of chief minister, with Devendra Fadnavis returning as deputy chief minister.",The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra.
