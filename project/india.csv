BJP X post

NEW DELHI: The BJP on Thursday slammed the Congress over an AI-generated video featuring Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his late mother Heeraben, accusing the party of taking a vow to “repeatedly insult” her. The clip was posted by the Bihar unit of the Congress.“The Congress has sworn to repeatedly insult the late mother of PM Shri Narendra Modi Ji. When they found nothing, they showed his mother in a fake video, making her say words that are a complete insult to her,” the Bihar BJP posted on X, alleging that such videos were being circulated at the behest of “arrogant” and “anarchic” Rahul Gandhi.The clip, shared on Wednesday, begins with an AI version of PM Modi going to sleep after declaring that the day’s “vote chori” (vote theft) is done. He then dreams of his mother, and the AI version of Heeraben appears.“First you forced me to stand in long queues during demonetisation and made a reel of washing my feet. Now you are doing politics in Bihar in my name. You are getting banners of my ‘insult’ printed. You are again doing drama in Bihar. How low will you stoop?” she asks, before “PM Modi” hurriedly wakes up.Gandhi has repeatedly accused the Election Commission of indulging in “vote chori” to benefit the BJP — a charge the poll body has firmly denied.This comes days after the prime minister was abused during a Congress-RJD rally in the poll-bound state, with his mother being mentioned. He hit back soon after, calling the remarks an insult not only to him but to “every mother, sister, and daughter of the country,” adding that the people of Bihar shared his anguish.Heeraben Modi passed away in December 2022 at the age of 99.","The clip was posted by the Bihar unit of the Congress.
