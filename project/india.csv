How UP managed to give quiet passage to 'explosive' Nazul Bill,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/how-up-managed-to-give-quiet-passage-to-explosive-nazul-bill/articleshow/112234601.cms,"On March 7, 2024, Yogi government notified the ordinance which barred conversion of Nazul land into freehold in favour of a private person.

LUCKNOW: When UP BJP chief Bhupendra Chaudhary, an MLC, referred the Nazul Property (Management and Use for Public Purpose) Bill 2024 tabled by his own governmentt in the assembly to a select committee of the Upper House, it was initially taken as another episode of govt vs organisation in UP. However, a close examination reveals that it was a well-coordinated move by BJP to blunt any opposition attack over the issue.On March 7, 2024, Yogi government notified the ordinance which barred conversion of Nazul land into freehold in favour of a private person.The idea was to get back land grabbed by land mafia and others and from those who violated lease rules .However, it gradually became apparent that its impact went well beyond land parcels occupied by land mafia. ""For example, a major part of Prayagraj city has been settled on Nazul land,"" said a BJP functionary. No wonder when the assembly passed the bill on Wednesday prominent among those who spoke against it were BJP MLAs from Prayagraj Siddharth Nath Singh and Harshvardhan Bajpayee. They were followed by Raja Bhaiyya (JD-L) and Aradhana Mishra (Cong), both MLAs from neighbouring Pratapgarh district. NDA partners also objected.A BJP member told TOI that around 50,000 families were annoyed with the ordinance and this was one of the factors for the party losing the Allahabad Lok Sabha seat. ""Resentment was brewing not only in Prayagraj but also in other districts,"" said a BJP MLA. ""The number of such Nazul land holders is in lakhs.""BJP, already on the backfoot after the LS poll result, realised the bill may adversely impact its prospects in the upcoming bypolls. CM Yogi Adityanath, deputy CMs Keshav Maurya and Brajesh Pathak, state BJP chief Chaudhary and parliamentary affairs minister Suresh Khanna went into a huddle to find an honourable exit route.A BJP MLA said the first step was to ensure it was passed in the lower House without offering SP an opportunity to protest. ""The objections raised by BJP MLAs were part of this move,"" he claimed. It was decided that in Vidhan Parishad, a BJP member should object to the bill and Chaudhary could refer it to the select committee. Asked why the bill was tabled when the ordinance itself was opposed, a BJP MLA said the protest was mainly limited to Prayagraj and surrounding areas. ""It was thought that objections would be addressed through amendments,"" he added.","On March 7, 2024, Yogi government notified the ordinance which barred conversion of Nazul land into freehold in favour of a private person.

UDAIPUR: Tension prevailed in Banswara district after residents of Chhoti Sarwan village clashed with police on Friday over the construction of a boundary wall for the proposed Mahi Nuclear Power Plant . PM Narendra Modi is expected to lay the foundation stone of the 2,800 MW plant soon.The altercation, which lasted about three hours, left three police personnel and several villagers injured.Twelve people, including a local functionary of the Bharat Adivasi Party, have been detained. The residents, who were protesting their relocation, hurled stones at police, who were there to evacuate the govt-acquired land and facilitate the building of the boundary wall by the Nuclear Power Corporation of In dia Ltd (NPCIL).About 3,000 people from six villages — Bari, Sajwania, Rail, Kharia Dev, Aadibhit and Katumbi — are being relocated. Some protesters retreated to a nearby hill and continued hurling stones. In response, police fired tear gas shells and dispersed a group of women obstructing National Highway 927-A.Banswara SP Harshvardhan Agarwala said teargas shells were fired to control the situation at the site of the Central govt project in Chhoti Sarwan. A Quick Response Team (QRT) jawan, Kalpesh Garasiya, sustained a head injury and was admitted to a hospital in Banswara.“Some people, whose land has been acquired for the proposed plant, are protesting even though they have been allotted alternative plots,” Agarwala said.The govt has provided a compensation of Rs 415 crore to acquire 553 hectares of land for the project. A 60-hectare plot of land has also been identified in nearby Kharia Dev to construct houses for the displaced villagers.The local populace, however, has been unwilling to relocate until their demands, including the establishment of ahospital, are met.In July, thousands of tribal people had assembled at Mangarh Dham in Banswara to raise their concerns and demand scrapping of the proposed nuclear power plant. The villagers had also boycotted the Lok Sabha elections over their demands.","Residents of Chhoti Sarwan village clashed with police on Friday over the construction of a boundary wall for the proposed Mahi Nuclear Power Plant.

Meanwhile, speaking to media in Nagpur, Fadnavis said, ""I haven't read Waze's letter. I learnt about it through media reports. If Waze indeed sent such a letter, its authenticity will be verified, and an investigation will follow.""NCP-SP's Jayant Patil said, ""Nowadays, a person in jail is also giving an interview. There are serious allegations against him (Waze), I don't think I need to reply to him."" Waze spoke to the media on Friday when a police team was escorting him from court to jail. The case recently made it back to the news after Deshmukh claimed that Fadnavis had attempted to pressure him into filing false affidavits against Uddhav Thackeray, his son Aaditya, then deputy CM Ajit Pawar, and former minister Anil Parab three years ago.In 2021, during the tenure of the MVA govt led by Thackeray, the then Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh had alleged that then home minister Anil Deshmukh had asked Waze to collect Rs 100 crore from orchestra bars in Mumbai for him. Singh had made the allegation after Deshmukh shunted him from the police commissioner's post following the Antilia bomb scare and the Mansukh Hiran murder case controversy, which led to Waze's arrest in the case by NIA.In Nagpur, Deshmukh, after sharing the dias with Fadnavis at the inauguration of the state planning commission building on Saturday, denied these accusations, pointing out that Bombay high court had granted him bail and explicitly stated that Waze's testimony was unreliable due to his criminal background. Deshmukh also questioned Fadnavis's judgment in using Waze's claims against him. The former home minister went on to accuse Fadnavis of orchestrating the plot in retaliation to his recent expose.NCP-SP MP Supriya Sule questioned the timing of Waze's statement, with the assembly election in the state approaching, and said, ""Which Jayant Patil he is talking about we don't know... dirty politics being played out in Maharashtra.

NEW DELHI: West Bengal minister Akhil Giri has come under scrutiny after a video surfaced showing him threatening and verbally abusing Moumita Sahu, a woman official from the state forest department . The incident took place on Saturday in Purba Medinipur district following the removal of illegal encroachments from forest land near Tajpur sea beach.In the footage, Giri can be heard making menacing remarks toward Sahu and her team, including threats of severe consequences if she continued to be involved in the matter.""Don’t talk too much. You are a government employee; bow down your head while speaking. See what happens to you within a week. If you involve yourself in this issue again, I will make sure you can’t return,"" Giri said.The forest department removed several illegal shops from the forest land near Tajpur beach on Friday night. These establishments were reportedly submerged during high tides. A senior forest department official told news agency PTI that while many constructions on forest land had gone unchecked, action was taken against these specific shops due to their location.Giri criticised the forest department’s actions, telling PTI, ""The forest department removed shops and is now disrupting the lives of poor people. Many constructions on forest land have not been addressed before.""The Bharatiya Janata Party also shared the video on X and challenged Mamata Banerjee to take action. The party questioned whether the accused would face consequences for his alleged threats and misconduct towards a woman.""Will Mamata Banerjee dare to throw out this Minister and put him behind the bars? Will charges be filed against him for obstructing government workers and outraging the modesty of women?
