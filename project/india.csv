Siddaramaiah Dismisses CM Change Talks Amid Rising Buzz in Congress Circles

BENGALURU/NEW DELHI: Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah slammed the door Thursday on speculation about an imminent baton change with his deputy DK Shivakumar by declaring there was ""no vacancy"" at the top. He then threw down the gauntlet to any future challenger with the clincher: ""I will lead party in 2028 state polls too.""Siddaramaiah, seen as being on shaky ground ever since his wife was named as an alleged beneficiary of Muda land-swap scam, acknowledged Shivakumar's chief ministerial ambitions but said he was realistic enough to accept that Karnataka had ""a CM for the full term"".""I am very much here before you. I am the CM of Karnataka. That is what Shivakumar has said, and I am also saying it,"" he told reporters in Delhi. ""Shivakumar has never stated that the CM should be changed,"" he said.On few MLAs seeking a change and rooting for Shivakumar, the CM claimed their numbers were insignificant. ""Few MLAs may support him, majority don't."" Sidda said he and Shivakumar were answerable to party brass... that was how it should be.Shivakumar, too, is in Delhi, apparently waiting to meet party chief Mallikarjun Kharge and LS LoP Rahul Gandhi. Party insiders said Shivakumar was attempting to convince Siddaramaiah through Congress high command to accept a rotation formula for the chief ministership, as was the buzz when the party came to govt in 2023.","Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah slammed the door on speculation about an imminent baton change with his deputy DK Shivakumar.

Delhi Judge Cash Row: Modi Govt Likely To Move Impeachment Motion Against Justice Varma

Poll Do you support the impeachment of Justice Yashwant Varma for corruption charges? Yes, he should be impeached No, he should not be impeached

NEW DELHI: With government indicating that it will set up a statutory inquiry committee as part of impeachment proceedings of Justice Yashwant Varma contrary to its earlier stance, Congress is likely to support the move to sack the judge on corruption charges, even as it plans to use the platform to ""embarrass"" BJP for ignoring similar proceedings against another judge Shekhar Yadav over ""hate speech"".The push in Congress is to use impeachment proceedings to hammer at government's ""selective approach"" against judges. In a rare occurrence, twin impeachment proceedings are hanging fire simultaneously - Varma is facing the charge of corruption after the alleged recovery and burning of cash at his residence, while Allahabad high court judge Shekhar Yadav is in the firing line for his controversial comments about Uniform Civil Code.Interestingly, while central government has announced its intent to bring an impeachment motion against Varma, opposition last Dec filed an impeachment notice against Yadav for ""hate speech"" but govt has maintained silence on it.Senior lawyer and Congress MP Abhishek Singhvi said, ""There should be no double standards in the way govt seeks to approach Varma and Yadav cases. Selectivity and opportunism between the two cases is not good.Both deserve initiation of impeachment process. In Yadav case, govt has already dragged its feet long enough.""Congress sources said the party is expected to support impeachment of Varma in monsoon session of Parliament. Congress functionaries like Singhvi and Vivek Tankha had earlier targeted govt for planning to do away with the inquiry panel provided for in Judges Inquiry Act, and warned that the ""violation"" will lay grounds for Varma's discharge later.Now, sources said, government has since conveyed that it will set up an inquiry committee on Varma.However, a big issue for opposition is ""hate speech"" by Justice Yadav, for which its impeachment notice is pending. Modi govt has not given any indication on taking it up, despite public calls for it by Congress functionaries, and a letter by lawyer-MP Vivek Tankha to Rajya Sabha chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar.A senior Congress functionary said, ""We are not linking the two issues of impeachment. We will support the move to sack Varma, but we will use the platform to embarrass govt on its selective approach on accountability in the judiciary.""","Congress is likely to support the move to sack the judge on corruption charges.
