Sanjay Roy raped and murdered RG Kar doctor: CBI chargesheet,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sanjay-roy-raped-and-murdered-rg-kar-doctor-cbi-chargesheet/articleshow/114023967.cms,"Accused Sanjay Roy (File photo)

KOLKATA: CBI on Monday filed a 45-page chargesheet, naming Kolkata Police volunteer Sanjay Roy as the sole accused in the Aug 9 rape-murder of a doctor inside RG Kar hospital. Cops had arrested Roy within 24 hours of the crime.CBI's first chargesheet in the case, submitted in a special court, requests Roy's trial in custody and leaves room for a supplementary chargesheet.Sources said Roy has been charged under BNS Sections 64(1) (punishment for rape), 66 (causing injury leading to death or vegetative state), and 103(1) (punishment for murder) - the latter two being punishable by death.Sanjay Roy, who is currently in solitary confinement at Presidency Correctional Home in Kolkata, is expected to appear in court on Oct 18.According to sources, CBI officers cited a total of 128 witnesses, with 51 tied directly to the rape-murder, and the rest related to charges of evidence-tampering and conspiracy. No one else has been formally charged in the document, though the agency is continuing to investigate possible complicity by others, including RG Kar college’s ex-principal Sandip Ghosh and Tala police station’s former officer-in-charge Abhijit Mandal. CBI arrested them on Sept 15.CBI’s chargesheet was filed on the third day of the fast-unto-death protest by West Bengal Junior Doctors’ Front , seeking a faster probe among other demands. “This is progress, but it’s been slow. We believe more people are involved,” said a junior doctor. Senior doctors questioned evidence-tampering efforts and expect the supplementary chargesheet to reveal more culprits.The victim’s father expressed faith in the legal process: “We don’t know about chargesheet, so I can’t comment on it. But we trust the law andCBI investigation.”Earlier, her parents had planned a five-day sit-in outside their home during Durga Puja but clarified Monday they would not be holding a formal protest. “My daughter used to organise the Durga Puja pandal at our house. This year, there will be no puja. Instead, we’ve asked for a stage to meet people during the puja days,” said the father.The Federation of All India Medical Association (FAIMA) on Monday announced a nationwide hunger strike from Wednesday, which will be two months from the day the alleged rape-murder of a trainee doctor happened.","CBI's first chargesheet in the case, submitted in a special court, requests Roy's trial in custody.

High-stakes J&K election: Congress-NC, PDP, BJP in pitched battle

Three-tier security in place for J&K vote counting

Top political leaders in J&K race

Two-way fight in Haryana

First major BJP vs Congress faceoff since LS polls

NEW DELHI: The stage is set for the results of the 2024 assembly elections in Haryana and Jammu & Kashmir, which will mark the first major electoral outcome following the recent Lok Sabha elections. The counting of votes will begin at 8am on October 8. The postal ballots will be counted first, followed by electronic voting machine (EVM) votes.As political parties await the outcome with bated breath, all eyes will be on the pollsters whose exit poll predictions would be tested with the actual results.The results are likely to reflect broader political sentiments as parties gear up for upcoming electoral battles in Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Delhi.Election to the 90-seat J&K assembly is particularly historic as it is the first since the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019, which altered the region's political landscape significantly.Exit polls indicate a competitive race between the Congress-National Conference (NC) alliance and the BJP, with predictions suggesting that the alliance may secure around 43 seats, still 3 seats short of a majority of 46.The BJP, on the other hand, is expected to win 27 seats, while the PDP and other parties are predicted to win 7 and 13 seats, respectively.The BJP's performance will be closely scrutinised as it seeks to establish itself further in the region after previously forming a coalition government with the People's Democratic Party (PDP)The first assembly election in Jammu and Kashmir since 2014 was conducted in three phases, with 24 seats voting in the first phase, 26 in the second, and 40 in the third. The fate of 873 candidates, competing for a seat in the 90-member house, has been sealed and will be revealed by Tuesday evening. The turnout was 63.45%, slightly lower than the 65.52% recorded in the 2014 assembly elections.As political parties evaluated their prospects, the administration was occupied with finalising arrangements, including security measures, at designated centres across all 20 district headquarters.Election commission officials have said that a three-tier security arrangement has been established at all counting centres to ensure smooth proceedings in the restive border union territory, which has long been a point of tension and has witnessed repeated instances of terrorism, insurgency, and infiltration from across the border.Prominent candidates in the fray include NC leader Omar Abdullah, Sajad Gani Lone of People's Conference, Pradesh Congress Committee president Tariq Hamid Karra, and BJP state president Ravindra Raina.Other notable contestants are AICC general secretary Ghulam Ahmad Mir, PDP leaders Waheed Para and Iltija Mufti, Apni Party president Altaf Bukhari, CPI(M) veteran Mohammad Yousuf Tarigami, and former deputy chief ministers Muzaffar Hussain Baig and Tara Chand.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is aiming for a third consecutive term despite facing anti-incumbency sentiments in Haryana. Meanwhile, the Congress, buoyed by exit polls suggesting a potential comeback, is eager to reclaim power after a decade in opposition.Other regional players like the Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) and the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) could play spoiler roles in this tightly contested election.Chief electoral officer, Pankaj Agarwal, has confirmed that all necessary preparations, including security arrangements, have been made for the counting process, which is set to begin at 8am.Polling in Haryana was held on October 5. The electorate, consisting of more than 2 crore registered voters, cast their ballots across all 90 constituencies in the state. Initially, the polls were planned to take place on October 1, but the election commission later decided to postpone the date to October 5.The elections witnessed a voter turnout of 67.9%.The Haryana elections saw the first major direct contest between the BJP and the Congress since the Lok Sabha polls, and the outcome will be used by the winning party to build a narrative in their favour for upcoming polls in other states.Jammu and Kashmir also held elections alongside Haryana, but most seats there have seen multi-corner contests rather than a direct Congress-BJP fight.According to exit polls, the Congress is set to make a triumphant return to power in Haryana after a decade-long hiatus.The party is projected to secure approximately 55 seats -- comfortably crossing the 46-seat majority mark -- while the BJP is expected to win around 27 seats. The INLD is predicted to win 2 seats, the JJP 1 seat, and others around 5 seats.",The results of the 2024 assembly elections in Haryana and Jammu & Kashmir will be announced on October 8. It will be the first major electoral outcome following the recent Lok Sabha elections. Election to the 90-seat J&K assembly is particularly historic as it is the first since the abrogation of Article 370.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114020834,imgsize-3843644,width-400,resizemode-4/114020834.jpg"

They insult the basic principles of Hinduism and damage idols. Hindus do not react to any of this. But if an ignorant person makes a remark, then there are malign attempts to create chaos.

If that happens then they have to face legal action...""Meanwhile, BJP MLA Shalabh Mani Tripathi threatened protestors that they would get a “taste of Israel” if they tried raising frenzied slogans in UP. “Here, treatment will be given through the constitution of Babasaheb and not the Sharia, and that too a proper one… don’t cry then,” said Tripathi on October 6 in a post on X.The chief minister made these comments during a review of the law and order situation with top officials, emphasizing that ""anarchy, vandalism or arson in the name of protest is not acceptable"" and those who dare to engage in such activities will have to face the consequences.Following Dasna temple priest Yati Narsinghanand's remarks against Prophet Muhammad, several Muslim organisations and political party leaders called for the priest's arrest and strict action against him. Two FIRs have been lodged against Narsinghanand and his disciples for their objectionable remarks.Meanwhile, CM Adityanath directed the police administration to ensure that upcoming festivals are celebrated with joy and harmony, and to identify and take strict action against those who attempt to spoil the atmosphere or work against the law. He further instructed the police to intensify foot patrolling and police response vehicles in crowded areas to ensure women's safety and convenience.","Yogi Adityanath said derogatory remarks against deities, great men, or saints of any religion or sect will not be tolerated.

Although exit polls showed BJP was headed for the exit, CM Nayab Singh Saini dismissed the findings. The elections mark the first big battle between BJP and Congress since the Lok Sabha polls. Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge asserted that his party would win in both Haryana and J&K.

""The people have voted for us, endorsing our vision for development and peace,"" he said, while predicting a ""crushing"" defeat for Congress. It will be interesting to see if BJP will try to get a Hindu appointed as chief minister in case Raina's assertion is proven correct: a prospect which can help them compensate substantially for the loss of Haryana and sharpen the Hindutva plank.As parties positioned themselves, security was tightened at counting centres across J&K, where voter turnout was 63%, slightly lower than the 65% in 2014.In Haryana, more than 1,000 candidates, including 101 women and 464 independents, contested in the single-phase elections to 90 constituencies, which saw a voter turnout of 68% on Oct 5.","Tuesday is a significant day for Haryana and J&K as votes are counted.

Jammu and Kashmir air thick with 'conspiracies' & controversies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jammu-and-kashmir-air-thick-with-conspiracies-controversies/articleshow/114024375.cms,"SRINAGAR: A fraught place even in the simpler of times, Jammu and Kashmir was a picture of keen anticipation on the eve of the election results, rife with rumours and agog with controversies that could determine the reaction of the people and the parties to the outcome.In the polls held after a gap long of 10 years and against the backdrop of the annulment of the special status for J&K under Art 370 and 35A, the question was if National Conference and Congress would get the numbers to form govt or fall short, triggering a mad scramble for alliances.But the bigger suspense seen with much trepidation in the Valley was if Jammu would give BJP enough seats to try forming govt with the famous ""X factors"" of this suspenseful contest - Apni Party, Engineer Rashid's AIP and independents.Ahead of the poll outcome, J&K was rocked by the controversy over ""five nominated MLAs"" that Centre said would be named by the LG. The opposition mocked that counting had already started for BJP and it would start its tally with five. There was talk of moving court if nominations were made by the LG instead of the future state cabinet ""as it should be"".State Congress president Tariq Hamid Karra called it ""pre-result rigging"", arguing that even the president cannot nominate members arbitrarily. PDP's Iltija Mufti said, ""1987's stolen election took J&K to the brink. Yet no lessons were learnt.""The protests were heard across regional faultlines, even as senior BJP neta and Bijbehara candidate Sofi Yousuf, named the five BJP members who would be nominated as MLAs. ""We are governing at the Centre, and obviously our members will be nominated,"" he said, fanning the flames. AICC general secretary K C Venugopal warned of a ""clear danger to the people's mandate"", adding, ""we are vigilant to all their dirty tricks and will not let them hijack our democracy. The misuse of Centre's powers will not be tolerated.""It was only partly comic that parties a day before the result were wondering if the majority mark in the assembly of 90 MLAs was 46 or 48. It was cricket and football at the same time, as some called it a ""free hit"" for BJP before the first ball had been bowled, and others dubbed it the ""shifting of the goalpost"".As if one row was not enough, the real X-factor Engineer Rashid stirred the pot further by demanding that regional parties refrain from forming govt till statehood is restored.NC and Congress accused Engineer of playing the BJP's game after visiting Delhi for a day. ""BJP would like nothing more than to extend the central rule in J&K, if they aren't in a position to form govt,"" Omar Abdullah said. Karra argued ""elections are fought to form govt and that obligation has to be fulfilled.""Amid the flux, there was confusion about the formation of a grand alliance to keep BJP at bay. PDP's Nayeem Akhtar offered support to NC and Farooq Abdullah reciprocated with gratitude. But Omar Abdullah and PDP's Iltija rubbished the talk as ""unnecessary speculation"".Mandate 2024 raised the guessing game if the divide between Jammu and Kashmir regions will continue. For all the hostility in Kashmir, there is already a talk about BJP eyeing its first seat in Kashmir, with Gurez seen as a real possibility.It remains to be seen how the ""X-factors"" of Kashmir will roll after the results, and if BJP will actually find proxies in the Valley. Most of the Valley players have sought votes solely in the name of confronting BJP. And the funny bit is that every player - NC, PDP, People's Conference, Engineer - targeted the other as BJP's ""sleeper cell"" as they jostled for secular votes riled by 370 and Hindutva. In this play, PDP was at a serious loss because of its 2014 tie-up with BJP. That has made the election an issue of survival for the Mufti outfit.","J&K was rocked by the controversy over ""five nominated MLAs"" that Centre said would be named by LG.

The outcome of this election is expected to be pivotal, as the winning party will likely leverage it to strengthen their narrative in other states with elections scheduled over the next few months.The primary contenders in the Haryana race are the BJP, Congress, Aam Aadmi Party, INLD-BSP, and JJP-Azad Samaj Party.

What exit polls predicted:

NEW DELHI: Haryana is set to announce its assembly election results on October 8, following a single-phase voting on October 5. Over 2 crore eligible voters and 1,031 candidates vying for 90 assembly seats, more than 20,000 polling stations were set up in the state.The Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) is aiming for a third consecutive term, banking on its “double-engine” government, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a key figure in the campaign.The Congress , led by Bhupinder Singh Hooda and Rahul Gandhi, is pushing for a comeback after nearly a decade out of power. Their campaign has focused on issues such as unemployment, agrarian distress, and law and order.The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), running independently after failing to form an alliance with the Congress, has positioned itself as a potential game-changer. Led by Arvind Kejriwal, AAP is focusing on clean governance and reforms, claiming that no government can be formed in Haryana without its support.Other key players include the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) in alliance with the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), and the Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) in coalition with the Azad Samaj Party. Both are targeting regional and rural voters, with leaders like Abhay Singh Chautala (INLD) and Dushyant Chautala (JJP) seeking to influence the post-poll scenario.The election results will decide whether the BJP retains power, Congress stages a comeback, or AAP and regional parties play kingmakers in Haryana’s political future.Haryana voted in a single phase, recording a final voter turnout of 61.19 per cent. The Election Commission reported that voting began at 7 am, with voters from various sections of society queuing up at polling stations. Notably, many elderly voters, including those over 100 years old, actively participated in the electoral process. This was lower in comparison to 64.8% voter turnout recorded in the 2024 Lok Sabha Elections at Haryana polling stations.Exit polls predicted that the Congress will be sweeping back into power in Haryana after a gap of 10 years.The party will be winning around 55 seats, the BJP 27 seats, INLD 2 seats, JJP 1 seat and others around 5 seats.As per pollster Matrize, Congress is expected to win 55-62 seats, BJP 18-24, INLD 3-6, JJP 0-3 and others 2-5 seats. Peoples Pulse has predicted that the Congress will secure around 49-61 seats, BJP 20-32, INLD 2-3, JJP 0-1 and others 3-5 seats.","Haryana is set to announce its assembly election results on October 8, following a single-phase voting on October 5.

NEW DELHI: Wrestler-turned-politician Vinesh Phogat who is contesting on Congress ticket is leading in Julana Constituency, as per early trends.Julana assembly constituency is one of the 90 Legislative Assembly constituencies in Haryana , India. It is located in the Jind district. The Julana Assembly constituency falls under the Sonipat Lok Sabha constituency.The Election Commission rescheduled the polling date in Haryana to Oct 5 and accordingly revised the counting date for Haryana to Oct 8.The main candidates for this election are Yogesh Bairagi representing the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Vinesh Phogat from the Indian National Congress (INC).Indian freestyle wrestler Vinesh Phogat participates in the 53 kg weight category and hails from a family of wrestlers. She is the cousin of Geeta Phogat and Babita Kumari. Vinesh has secured numerous medals for India in international competitions such as the Asian Games and Commonwealth Games. Notably, she was the first Indian woman wrestler to qualify for the Olympics, where she won a bronze medal in the 2021 Tokyo Olympics in the 53 kg category.Recently, Vinesh Phogat, along with other Indian wrestlers, staged a protest at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi. The protest targetted Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, the chief of the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI), who faces allegations of sexual harassment and criminal intimidation from seven female wrestlers. The alleged incidents reportedly occurred over a decade, from 2012 to 2022. The wrestlers demanded that a police complaint be filed against Singh and that he be arrested under the POCSO Act since one of the complainants is a minor.The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) rejected Vinesh Phogat's appeal against her disqualification from the 50kg category final at the Paris Olympics. Vinesh, who was disqualified for being 100 grams overweight during the second weigh-in on the morning of her gold-medal match, had also requested to be awarded a joint silver medal.However, CAS dismissed both her appeal and her demand for the medal. In a statement, IOA President PT Usha expressed ""shock and disappointment at the decision of the Sole Arbitrator at the CAS to dismiss wrestler Vinesh Phogat's application against the United World Wrestling (UWW) and the International Olympic Committee (IOC).""""The operative part of the August 14 decision, which dismisses Vinesh's application to be awarded a shared silver medal in women's 50 kg category at the Paris Olympic Games has significant implications for her in particular and the sporting community at large,"" the IOA stated.With Vinesh's appeal rejected, India's medal tally from the Paris Olympics stands at six, comprising one silver and five bronze.Vinesh announced her retirement from the sport a day after being disqualified, stating she no longer had the strength to continue.""The marginal discrepancy of a 100 grams and the resultant consequences has profound impact, not only in terms of Vinesh's career but also raises serious questions about ambiguous rules and their interpretation,"" the IOA statement said.Several political parties have announced their candidates for the Haryana Assembly Elections 2024 , specifically from the Julana constituency.
