""It's an all-encompassing cabinet with a good number of women ministers . It also did a good balancing act between the OBCs and Marathas ,"" he added.The dropping of Fadnavis's 'trusted lieutenant' Ravindra Chavan, who was in charge of the Konkan region for the assembly elections, came as a shock to many. ""It is clear that Fadnavis did not have a free hand in the selection of candidates from BJP,"" said sources. ""Chandrakant Patil is a close aide of Union home minister Amit Shah and makes it to the cabinet irrespective of his performance. Pankaja Munde and Ashish Shelar being brought into the cabinet, and the inclusion of Nitesh Rane also indicates that the central leadership had a role to play. MLAs from Amravati and Washim, two crucial districts in Vidarbha, were not considered, while novices like Phundkar were.""While Munde is not a favourite with the Centre either, social equations in Marathwada, the polarisation between the VJNT community and Marathas played a crucial role in her selection. To appease the Marathas, there is Shivendra Raje Bhosale, a descendant of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, and Patil. And by picking Ashok Uike, a tribal MLA from Yavatmal, BJP has looked beyond Nandurbar and Palghar, said sources.Political analyst Abhay Deshpande said the inclusion of state BJP chief Chandrashekhar Bawankule and Shelar is a message to party workers that working hard for the party pays dividends. ""Girish Mahajan, a confidant of Fadnavis who was tipped to be state party president, found a place in the cabinet. Rane's inclusion is indicative that the party will use him to further its Hindutva agenda along with ensuring a face in Konkan, that is dominated by the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena,"" he added.The presence of ministers from every region in the cabinet will also prove useful for the coming local elections as they would be put in charge of winning these polls, said sources.","The dropping of Fadnavis's 'trusted lieutenant' Ravindra Chavan, who was in charge of the Konkan region for the assembly elections, came as a shock to many.

Leadership has to be earned: Omar on Congress

helming INDIA

NEW DELHI: J&K CM Omar Abdullah's dismissal of Congress's allegations of tampering with EVMs and his assertions that he has never blamed the machines for election outcomes put his ally in the state and INDIA bloc on a sticky wicket.Congress has been stepping up its attack on EVMs since its poll losses in Haryana and Maharashtra.""When you get a hundred plus members of Parliament using the same EVMs, and you celebrate that as sort of a victory for your party, you can't then a few months later turn around and say... we don't like these EVMs because now the election results aren't going the way we would like them to,"" Abdullah said in a PTI interview.When told he sounded suspiciously like a BJP spokesperson, he was quoted saying, “God forbid!” He then added, “No, it’s just that... what’s right is right.” “One day voters choose you, the next day they don’t,” Omar Abdullah said. He gave his own example of facing defeat in Lok Sabha polls while winning a majority in the Sept assembly polls. “I never blamed the machines,” he said.He said parties should not contest elections if they do not trust the voting mechanism. “If you have problems with the EVMs, then you should be consistent in those problems,” he said while replying to a question about whether he thinks that the opposition in general, and Congress, in particular, is barking up the wrong tree by focusing on EVMs.National Conference has been “exasperated with Congress” over the way it fought the J&K elections. Abdullah had said midway during the campaign that Congress is unnecessarily focusing on Kashmir when the elections are about how Congress will perform in Jammu.Acknowledging growing discontent among INDIA bloc partners with Congress, Abdullah asked the latter to justify its leadership role in the alliance as it holds a significant position as the largest opposition party in the Parliament. In the interview, he emphasised that leadership has to be “earned and cannot be taken for granted”. The Congress leadership, however, refrained from reacting to the remarks.","Congress has been stepping up its attack on EVMs since its poll losses in Haryana and Maharashtra. “One day voters choose you, the next day they don’t,” Omar Abdullah said.

Governor CP Radhakrishnan administered oath to the ministers at Raj Bhavan in Nagpur.The swearing-in of the state cabinet in Nagpur, which comes a day before the winter session of the legislature, marks a rare occasion as the last such ceremony in Nagpur happened in 1991, when the then governor C Subramaniam administered oath to Chhagan Bhujbal and other ministers.The portfolio allocation to the ministers is expected to wrap up soon as the parties have just one day to ascertain the roles of the MLAs before the session kicks off.The cabinet was sworn in ten days after Devendra Fadnavis took oath as chief minister at Mumbai's Azad Maidan. Prime Minister Narendra Modi attended the ceremony, which also saw Ajit Pawar from the NCP and former CM Eknath Shinde from Shiv Sena taking oath as deputy chief ministers.The prolonged deliberations over portfolio allocations and last-minute Cabinet swearing-in could be attributed to Mahayuti's challenges in balancing power with Shiv Sena and NCP factions, both eager to secure influential roles in the government.In the state polls, the BJP-led Mahayuti alliance secured a decisive victory, winning 235 seats.

'Be consistent': Omar Abdullah's swipe at ally Congress on EVM charge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cant-celebrate-evms-when-you-win-blame-when-you-lose-omar-abdullahs-jibe-at-congress/articleshow/116337229.cms,"'Convenient hypocrisy': Abdullah on BJP's dynasty politics criticism

'Some allies feel Congress isn’t doing enough to justify its role'

NEW DELHI: Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah on Sunday criticised INDIA bloc ally Congress for its inconsistent stance on Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs), taking a pointed swipe at the party's selective trust in the voting mechanism.In an exclusive interview with news agency PTI, Abdullah said, “When you get over a hundred members of Parliament using the same EVMs and celebrate that as a victory, you can’t then turn around and blame them when the results don’t go your way.”""If you have problems with the EVMs, then you should be consistent in those problems,"" he added.Continuing to toe a different line from Congress, Abdullah praised the new Parliament building, a project the grand old party had sharply criticised.""Contrary to what everybody else believes, I think that what's happening with this Central Vista project in Delhi is a damn good thing. I believe constructing a new Parliament building was an excellent idea. We needed a new Parliament building. The old one had outlived its utility,"" the J&K CM said.His remarks add to growing friction between the National Conference and Congress, allies within the INDIA opposition bloc. Abdullah expressed disappointment over the Congress’ performance during theJammu and Kashmir Assembly elections , where the National Conference carried much of the campaign burden. The NC secured 42 seats compared to Congress’ six in the 90-member assembly.Addressing criticism of dynasty politics, Abdullah rejected the notion that family lineage guarantees political success. Drawing from personal experience, he told PTI, “Belonging to a political family is not a lifelong ticket to success. I’ve lost elections despite my family’s legacy.”Abdullah criticised the BJP for its selective outrage against dynasties, pointing out that the party tolerates such politics among its allies. “The BJP has no problem with political families that align with them. It’s convenient hypocrisy,” he said. Abdullah underscored that dynastic politicians in opposition are often unfairly targeted while similar practices within the BJP’s ranks remain unchallenged.He also reflected on his own family’s political journey, noting that his sons would need to build their careers independently. “Nobody is going to give them anything on a plate,” he remarked.Omar Abdullah also took aim at Congress’ role as the leader of the INDIA bloc, questioning whether the party has done enough to justify its leadership position.“By virtue of being the single largest party in Parliament, and also having the leader of opposition in both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, the fact that they have a pan-India footprint, which no other party can lay claim to, they are natural sort of leaders of an opposition movement,” he acknowledged.However, he added, “Yet there is a sense of disquiet among some of the allies because they feel the Congress is ‘not doing enough to justify it or to earn it or to keep it. That’s something the Congress might wish to consider.”Abdullah criticised the bloc’s sporadic engagement, arguing that its activities can’t be limited to a few months before elections saying, “you just come alive once Lok Sabha elections are announced and suddenly start talking and trying to work things out.”","Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah criticised INDIA bloc ally Congress for its inconsistent stance on Electronic Voting Machines.

While quashing a Section 498A IPC case against a husband and his parents in a separate matter, a bench of Justices BV Nagarathna and N Kotiswar Singh observed that the provision had become a tool for unleashing personal vendetta against the husband and his family by a wife.","Pawan Kumar Modi, father of deceased Bengaluru techie, raised concerns over the whereabouts of his grandson.
