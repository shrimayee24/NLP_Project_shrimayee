Divorced woman seeks SC help to 'adopt' own child,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/divorced-woman-seeks-sc-help-to-adopt-own-child/articleshow/112056114.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a curious turn of events, a divorced woman , who remarried , knocked the doors of the Supreme Court on Friday seeking to adopt her son, born from her earlier marriage, along with his stepfather without the biological father's consent, mandatorily required under the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act (HAMA).Appearing for petitioner Divya Jyoti Singh, advocate Vanshaja Shukla narrated her plight before a bench of CJI D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, which issued notice to her former husband .Singh and her former husband are advocates who got married in Nov 2013. She alleged that the man deserted her in Sep 2015 when she was in an advanced stage of pregnancy and ""repulsively"" eloped with her brother's wife. She said along with her parents and brother, she had caught her then husband and sister-in-law in a hotel in 2016.The man and her brother's wife started living together with the latter's four-year-old daughter. Singh said the man did not even visit her once after their son was born in Oct 2015. After filing of cross cases by both sides against each other, a family court granted them divorce by mutual consent in Sep 2016. In 2018, the man and Singh's sister-in-law got married and had a child who is now four years old.Shukla said Singh remarried in 2020 and her husband and family agreed to accept her child. ""The decision to remarry, in spite of undergoing unspeakable stress, pain and agony, was because she wanted to provide the child with a normal and healthy upbringing,"" she said.While referring to repeated and continuous harassment from her former husband, Singh sought the court's permission to adopt her own son along with the stepfather without having to comply with Section 9(2) of HAMA that makes consent of the biological father mandatory for giving up a child on adoption.The CJI-led bench said, ""When HAMA mandates consent of the biological father, how do we compel him to give up custody even when the mother has been entrusted with guardianship of the child. However difficult the case may be, we will issue notice (to the erstwhile husband)."" Asking the jurisdictional station house officer of Delhi Police to serve the notice on the former husband, it asked the man to respond in two weeks.","Divya Jyoti Singh sought to adopt her son, born from her earlier marriage, along with his stepfather without the biological father's consent.

Back then, BJP was in power, and opposition parties like Congress and Left showed their true colours by calling for a special Rajya Sabha session during the middle of the Kargil war only to criticise the armed forces,"" Modi said. The post claimed Congress back then refused to criticise ""an adversary nation"".Modi also questioned Sonia Gandhi's silence on Pakistan. He recalled how Atal Bihari Vajpayee, despite being in the opposition, fully supported Indira Gandhi during the 1971 war, ""displaying a spirit of true national unity"". ""In stark contrast, Sonia Gandhi's silence during the Kargil conflict was concerning and raised doubts, a silence which continues even now, 25 years later,"" he said.Tasked with overseeing work in Himachal Pradesh 25 years ago, Modi boarded an Mi-17 helicopter laden with essential supplies for soldiers while the war was raging. Modi and his team landed in Srinagar amid continuous shelling by the Pakistani army.Modi had many chances to speak with the soldiers. During their conversations, he thanked them for their courage, but they insisted that the credit should go to then PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee.Modi said he was surprised that the soldiers attributed the victory to the nation's leader. A soldier explained that despite several attempts to capture Tiger Hill, the Indian Army was unable to achieve success. But while listening to the radio in their bunker one evening, they heard that then US president Bill Clinton had invited Vajpayee to the US but the latter declined, saying his soldiers were on the battlefield and he had no time for a visit.This refusal inspired the soldiers, Modi said. Motivated by their PM's commitment, they fought with renewed vigour that very night, and achieved victory.

That is why most states decided to boycott the meeting.”Admitting that she was in two minds on attending the meeting, Banerjee said, “even I had thought of skipping it, so I cancelled my trip yesterday, but Abhishek (Banerjee, TMC MP and party general secretary) convinced me this morning to attend the meeting and raise our issues on the joint platform, since I had earlier decided to come for it and had prepared what to say… so I decided to speak for my state and also on behalf of all our INDIA bloc states who won’t be there.”""They (BJP) have formed government but they don't have people's mandate.

Move to introduce private member’s bill on binding governors to advice of council of ministers causes uproar in RS,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/move-to-introduce-private-members-bill-on-binding-governors-to-advice-of-council-of-ministers-causes-uproar-in-rs/articleshow/112050354.cms,"NEW DELHI: Rajya Sabha witnessed major uproar in the second half of Friday after Kerala MP John Brittas moved to introduce a private member’s bill seeking to make governors constitutionally bound by the advice of the council of ministers of states. In a rare instance, the introduction of the bill was defeated with treasury benches voting against it.Introducing the Constitution (Amendment) Bill, Brittas said the legislation sought to ensure the “constitutional responsibility of Governors towards the Council of Ministers in carrying out their functions by confining their roles strictly within the bounds of the constitutional provisions”.The bill proposed preventing governors from assuming chancellorship or any other extra-constitutional roles.When Deputy Chairman Harivansh put the proposal to introduce the bill to voice vote, the treasury bench members objected to it. At this point he allowed Brittas to make a brief remark on the bill. The CPM MP alleged while the Centre has been “harping on cooperative federalism” what is “denting” the federal structure is the role of governors. “What is happening now is that the governors are unleashed against elected govts,” he alleged.Opposing this, BJP MP Sudhanshu Trivedi said Indian Constitution is quasi-federal and the governor is considered to be the representative of the President. He asked if the governor is asked to abide by the advice of the council of ministers then where is the right of the President.After rounds of verbal duels between treasury and opposition benches the proposal was put to vote and was defeated with 56 votes against and 21 votes in favour.Later, there was another face off between the two sides when minister Piyush Goyal flagged a post on X by AAP MP Sanjay Singh, which alleged that BJP lawmakers created ruckus and forced adjournment and this showed how the party is against Dalits, backwards and tribal. Goyal demanded Singh delete the post and seek apology.Amid the allegations and counter allegations, Singh raised the issue of how some treasury members were “threatening” to send him to jail. Taking note of claims of Goyal and Singh, Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar said he will hold discussion with them and give his views.","Kerala MP John Brittas moved to introduce a bill seeking to make governors constitutionally bound by the advice of the council of ministers of states.

NAGPUR: The political slugfest in Maharashtra intensified on Thursday as former home minister Anil Deshmukh dared deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis to make public the video clips allegedly showing Deshmukh speaking against NCP (SP) chief Sharad Pawar and Shiv Sena (UBT) president Uddhav Thackeray.Talking to the media, the Katol MLA brandished a pen drive, claiming it contained evidence of how Fadnavis, through central govt agencies like ED and CBI, had allegedly pressured him to sign false affidavits aimed at toppling the MVA govt.“If anyone challenges me to show proof against Fadnavis, I will hand over this pen drive with video evidence at an appropriate time. I don’t speak without proof,” Deshmukh warned, responding to Fadnavis’ recent threat to release evidence against him.Deshmukh, home minister in MVA govt, stepped down in April 2021 following accusations by then Mumbai CP Param Bir Singh that he instructed police to collect money from hotel and bar owners in the city.Recounting the events, Deshmukh said the controversy erupted after an explosive device was found outside noted industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence. The subsequent investigation implicated Singh, leading to his transfer and suspension.Deshmukh alleged that Singh, under Fadnavis’ direction, made false accusations against him. “Singh never appeared for the investigation. Instead, he submitted an affidavit to the court admitting he had no evidence against me and that his allegations were based on hearsay,” he said.The NCP leader also claimed that following Singh’s affidavit, Fadnavis pressured him to make false accusations against key MVA figures, including Uddhav and Aaditya Thackeray, then deputy CM Ajit Pawar, and minister Anil Parab. “If I had complied with Fadnavis’ demands three years ago, I would have avoided jail, but the MVA govt would have collapsed,” he added.Deshmukh reiterated his allegation from Wednesday that an ‘intermediary’ of Fadnavis had asked him to provide affidavits against important MVA figures to avoid legal troubles himself.However, Fadnavis, who holds the home department, had denied these accusations. He countered by suggesting that Deshmukh’s own party leaders had provided incriminating audio-visual evidence against him.Deshmukh’s allegations sent ripples in Maharashtra’s politics and the confrontation has escalated amidst preparations for the upcoming assembly polls.

The INDIA bloc will rally on July 30 at Jantar Mantar, New Delhi, to address concerns about Arvind Kejriwal's health in Tihar Jail.

BJP says Arvind Kejriwal govt must go; allegations frivolous, says AAP

BJP accused the AAP government of corruption and neglecting development in Delhi, calling for resignations. AAP defended its record, highlighting transparent governance and revenue surplus. Both parties traded allegations as election tensions rise.

NEW DELHI: Even as AAP announced that INDIA bloc of opposition parties will hold a rally on July 30 at Jantar Mantar here to raise the issue of Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal's declining health in Tihar jail , Congress functionaries had “no idea” when asked whether they would join.

Party sources, however, said a meeting would be held to work out out the details of the rally.Congress functionaries appeared to be unaware of any rally plan.Delhi unit of Congress, however, was clear that its members are unlikely to join the rally as they prepare for Delhi polls slated for early next year and have been going all out in their attack on AAP as they protest over governance and alleged corruption in Kejriwal govt.AAP, which is a constituent of INDIA bloc, has been accusing BJP-led central govt and Delhi LG V K Saxena of endangering Kejriwal's life.
