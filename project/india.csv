Judges taking poll plunge or govt posts after retirement improper: CJI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/judges-taking-poll-plunge-or-govt-posts-after-retirement-improper-cji/articleshow/121635797.cms,"CJI BR Gavai (file photo: PTI)

NEW DELHI: Taking a swipe at judges who resign to contest polls, as Calcutta HC’s Justice Abhijit Ganguly did last year, or take govt posts after retirement, CJI B R Gavai said such decisions raises “significant ethical concerns” and could undermine public trust in judiciary’s integrity.Delivering a lecture at a round table organized by the UK Supreme Court on Tuesday evening, CJI Gavai said, “If a judge takes up another appointment with the government immediately after retirement, or resigns from the bench to contest elections, it raises significant ethical concerns and invites public scrutiny.”“A judge contesting an election for a political office can lead to doubts regarding the independence and impartiality of the judiciary, as it may be seen as a conflict of interest or as an attempt to gain favour with the government,” he said.“The timing and nature of such post-retirement engagements could undermine the public’s trust in the judiciary’s integrity, as it could create a perception that judicial decisions were influenced by the prospect of future government appointments or political involvement,” Justice Gavai said.Flagging this tradition of judges accepting post-retirement assignments, roles and positions from the government, which is as old as the institution, Justice Gavai said, “In light of this, many of my colleagues and I have publicly pledged not to accept any post-retirement roles or positions from the government.This commitment is an effort to preserve the credibility and independence of the judiciary.”The first of the SC judges to accept the post of governorship was Justice S Fazl Ali, whose appointment as Governor of Orissa (now Odisha) was announced by Jawaharlal Nehru government in 1952 when he was still a judge of the Supreme Court. It had raised ethical issues in the legal circles. Since then, many SC judges – Fathima Beevi, P Sathasivam and S Abdul Nazeer - have accepted gubernatorial posts after retirement.Justice Ganguly’s plunge into politics immediately after resigning from Calcutta HC and contesting elections on a BJP ticket was dramatic as he had judicially castigated TMC govt in many cases, including the teachers’ recruitment scam. But there were many such precedents involving SC judges.The much-admired Justice V R Krishna Iyer epitomized the politician-turned-judge-turned-politician. Justice Baharul Islam, an out and out congressman was elected to Rajya Sabha in 1962 and re-elected in 1968, in between unsuccessfully contesting Assam Assembly elections. Islam resigned from RS in 1972 to become a judge of Gauhati HC and retired in 1980 to immediately return to active politics. Nine months after his retirement, the Indira Gandhi govt appointed him as a judge of the SC. He resigned in 1983, weeks after giving a verdict favouring Bihar COM Jagannath Mishra in a corruption case, to contest for the Barpeta Lok Sabha seat. When the elections got countermanded, the Congress elected him to Rajya Sabha in 1983.Even Justice K S Hegde was a congressman and was elected to RS in 1952 for a two-year term and then again in 1954. In 1957, he resigned to become a judge of Mysore HC and became a SC judge in 1967. He, along with Justices J M Shelat and A N Grover, resigned in 1973 when they were superseded by Indira Gandhi govt in 1973 to appoint Justice A N Ray as CJI.Hegde contested and won from Bangalore North constituency in 1977 on a Janata Party ticket and became Speaker of LS. He later joined BJP and was one of its vice-presidents from 1980-86. He had unsuccessfully contested the 1984 LS elections. There are many former judges of the Sc and HCs who gleefully accept govt roles or positions after retirement. Some of the statutes require retired constitutional court judges to head certain institutions.Justices A M Thipsay, Vijay Bahuguna, M Rama Jois, Rajinder Sachar had plunged into politics after retiring as HC judges. Former CJI Ranganath Misra became NHRC chief and then was elected to RS on a congress ticket. Ex-CJI Ranjan Gogoi was nominated to RS.","CJI B R Gavai said judges who resign to contest polls or take govt posts after retirement could undermine public trust in judiciary’s integrity. “If a judge takes up another appointment with the government immediately after retirement, or resigns from the bench to contest elections, it raises significant ethical concerns and invites public scrutiny,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121635881,imgsize-752927,width-400,resizemode-4/121635881.jpg"
"Bengaluru stampede: CM Siddaramaiah name-drops 'Maha Kumbh', says 'such incidents happened at many places'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bengaluru-stampede-cm-siddaramaiah-name-drops-kumbh-mela-says-such-incidents-happened-at-many-places/articleshow/121627796.cms,"Poll How do you feel about the comparison of the Bengaluru stampede to past incidents like the Kumbh Mela? It's valid to compare for context. It depends on the circumstances of each event.

NEW DELHI: Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah on Wednesday while saying he did not ""want to defend"" the Bengaluru stampede that claimed 11 lives, also said ""many stampedes have occurred"". As the chief minister said his ""government will not do politics on the incident"", he also name-dropped Kumbh Mela at the press conference.""I don't want to defend this incident. Our government will not do politics on this. I have ordered a magisterial inquiry and given 15 days. People even broke the gates of the stadium. There was a stampede. No one expected such a huge crowd. The stadium has a capacity of only 35,000 people, but 2-3 lakh people came,"" CM Siddaramaiah said.However, while responding to questions about BJP's charges of ""gross negligence"", he added, “Such incidents happened in many places; I am not going to defend it by comparing them and saying that it happened here and there ... 50-60 people died in Kumbh Mela. I did not criticise. If Congress criticises, then that is a different matter. Did I or the Karnataka government criticise?”Meanwhile, the BJP came down heavily on the Congress-led government holding CM Siddaramaiah and home minister G Parameshwara accountable for the deaths.Karnataka BJP president BY Vijayendra accused the state government of exerting pressure on the police and organising the event without proper planning or adequate security arrangements. “Is it not the state government’s responsibility to be prepared? Were they not aware that lakhs of people would turn up?” he asked.The stampede near Chinnaswamy Stadium claimed 11 lives and left 33 injured as thousands of fans gathered to celebrate RCB’s historic IPL win.Union minister Pralhad Joshi also held the state government squarely responsible. “It’s heartbreaking to see such loss due to poor planning and crowd mismanagement,” the Dharwad MP posted on X.Joshi said the tragedy could have been avoided with proper coordination and emergency preparedness. “Celebrations are one thing, but the government acted in haste without involving emergency services. Accountability must be fixed,” he said.Read: At least 11 dead, 33 hurt in Bengaluru stampede during RCB victory parade; how chaos & tragedy unfolded","Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah said he did not ""want to defend"" the Bengaluru stampede that claimed 11 lives.

Work withdrawn from Punjab judge after HC admin recommends his compulsory retirement,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/work-withdrawn-from-punjab-judge-after-hc-admin-recommends-his-compulsory-retirement/articleshow/121631680.cms,"



CHANDIGARH: Just days after the Punjab and Haryana high court administration recommended compulsory retirement of Tejwinder Singh, judicial responsibilities have been withdrawn from him. Singh, one of Punjab's senior-most district and sessions judges, was serving as the presiding officer of the industrial tribunal in Patiala.Sources confirmed that since the HC administration has sent the recommendations regarding his compulsory retirement to the Punjab govt, it was a routine exercise to withdraw judicial work from the concerned judicial officer. As per rules, the decision to compulsorily retire Tejwinder Singh would be notified by the Punjab govt.Singh had first come into limelight in June 2019, when he had convicted six persons in the infamous Kathua rape and murder case. While three were awarded life sentence, other three accused were given five-year jail terms. The trial was conducted in his court after the Supreme Court had shifted the case from Kathua to Pathankot, where he was posted as the district and sessions judge.Known for his sobriety and professional competence, Singh joined the Punjab judicial services in 1991 at the age of 23 and made it to the 1993 edition of the Limca Book of World Records for being India's youngest magistrate.He had also served as magistrate in Chandigarh.Singh had also practiced as an advocate at the Punjab and Haryana high court for around a year before joining the judicial services. In March 2017, he completed his doctorate in law from the Panjab University in Chandigarh on ""Legislative Measures To Control Terrorism And Their Enforcement With Special Reference To The State Of Punjab: A Critique.""Singh had qualified for Punjab judiciary examination in 1989 and started his career as a magistrate in Ludhiana.","Tejwinder Singh, one of Punjab's senior-most district and sessions judges, was serving as the presiding officer of the industrial tribunal in Patiala.

"Bangladesh Supreme Court restores Jamaat's party registration, clears path to contest polls",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-supreme-court-restores-jamaats-party-registration-clears-path-to-contest-polls/articleshow/121557628.cms,"DHAKA:





Bangladesh's Supreme Court on Sunday ordered the Election Commission to restore the right-wing Jamaat-e-Islami's party registration, nearly eight months after the interim govt lifted a ban on it, clearing the way for its participation in future elections.Court officials said the SC's appellate division, led by chief justice Syed Refaat Ahmed, directed the commission to restore the party's registration.The apex court said it was up to EC to decide if Jamaat could contest polls using its traditional ""scale"" symbol.EC scrapped the registration of Jamaat, which was opposed to Bangladesh's 1971 independence from Pakistan, in Dec 2018 in line with a HC ruling. In 2013, SC cancelled the registration of the Jamaat-e-Islami, saying the party is unfit to contest national elections.Former PM Sheikh Hasina's govt slapped a total ban on the party days ahead of her ouster on Aug 5, 2024 in a violent mass movement led by a platform called Students against Discrimination (SAD).Jamaat and several other parties had backed SAD.After Hasina's ouster, the party appealed for a review of the 2013 court order banning it.""Today concludes the decade-long legal battle. We hope Bangladesh will have a vibrant parliament after this verdict. We hope voters will vote for the Jamaat candidate of their choice now,"" one of Jamaat's leading counsels Mohammad Shishir Manir said.","Bangladesh's Supreme Court orders the Election Commission to restore the right- wing Jamaat-e-Islami's party registration.
