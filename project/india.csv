"Amiable, articulate & pragmatic communist",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amiable-articulate-pragmatic-communist/articleshow/113307967.cms,"Sitaram Yechury , who died on Thursday, was party politically a committed communist but in political praxis — to use a term much favoured by Marxist pundits — he favoured pragmatism over dogma. And like many pragmatic politicians of his generation, he was courteous and amiable, qualities that didn’t depend on which side of the aisle his interlocutor belonged to.He was among the few CPM leaders who didn’t ideologically over-analyse whether the party should ally with Congress , earlier identified as communists’ chief adversary, to take on BJP when the latter became a governing party under Vajpayee’s leadership.During the 2024 campaign, he insisted Modi-led BJP should be taken on in state-by-state contests, via alliances. An analysis partly borne out by results. Interestingly, CPM’s ideological purists still don’t formally acknowledge the party’s alliance with Congress, never mind that CPM is a part of INDIA bloc .That Yechury, as a student politician, had forced Indira Gandhi to step down as JNU chancellor made his later pragmatism all the more noticeable. That he stayed away from Naxalites in 1970s, because that offshoot of Marxist politics declared loyalty to China’s communists, was another indication of his practical political sense. As he said in 2014, when Modi took office for the first time: “Conditions have changed, so our analysis and alignment accordingly will change”.If some assessments of his pragmatism compare him to the other practical communist, Harkishen Singh Surjeet, an astute alliance builder, it should be noted that the difference in the success rate of the two is explained largely by CPM having been in a politically more commanding position during Surjeet’s heydays.Yechury’s easygoing nature wasn't a later day political makeover. Even as a student activist he wasn't known for being overbearing or loudly declaratory. Engaging in debates was his style, and witty one-liners were his rhetorical signature. Many politicians, including communists, are given to ranting. Yechury never was. The other standout feature was unlike many fellow Marxists, he avoided jargon. Again, unlike doctrinaire Marxists, he was always interested in not just class but also social groups and religion. He understood the latter were valuable in understanding Indian society.Telugu was his mother tongue. In the party forum and in meetings, he preferred English because he felt that political formulation came more easily to him in that language. But he gave public speeches in Hindi. During his two-term stint in the Rajya Sabha from Bengal, he tried to speak in Bengali during his conversations with Bengali journalists.Born to a Telugu Brahmin family, Yechury had refused to wear the sacred thread and chant slokas. He said he was the first communist in his family. But he didn’t discount philosophical debates embedded in the ancient religious texts. An open-mindedness that later helped him debate the Hindu Right.Those who knew him well said one of Yechury’s defining qualities as a politician was that he was more interested in finding commonalities than divergences between parties and groups. These attributes served him well in Parliament, where his articulation stood out as the general quality of parliamentary interventions worsened. When he ended his Rajya Sabha term in 2017, Samajwadi Party MP Ram Gopal Yadav’s tribute stood out. But he wasn’t the only MP who felt the House would miss Yechury.Of course, as the Left’s electoral footprint shrank, so did the national political importance of CPM leaders, including Yechury. The high point was between 2004 and 2008 — from the time UPA-1 was formed till when CPM withdrew support to Manmohan Singh ’s govt over the Indo-US nuclear deal.It’s rare for Indian politicians, including communists, to introspect publicly. But Yechury proved an exception when, after UPA-2 took office, he admitted that his party hadn’t been able to explain its stand on the nuclear deal to voters, who gave a Congressled coalition a healthy victory. He was perhaps the only politburo member to do so.Losing Bengal to TMC dealt a blow to CPM and its leaders they haven't recovered from. Yechury, along with other CPM leaders, rarely made national headlines.But his international communist connections did make him very relevant when in 2009, UPA govt took his help to contact Nepal's Maoist leader Prachanda, who later became PM.Yechury’s last public message came the day he was shifted from the ICU to a general bed at AIIMS, Delhi. The recorded message was his tribute to another communist stalwart, former chief minister of Bengal, Buddhadeb Bhattacharya, who passed away recently.Yechury was dealing with a deeply personal tragedy when he fell ill. He lost his son Ashish to Covid in 2021. He was never quite the same after that, those close to him said. The father in him was bereft. But it speaks to his abilities as a politician that the pragmatic communist in him soldiered on.",Sitaram Yechury was a committed communist but in political praxis he favoured pragmatism over dogma. He was among the few CPM leaders who didn’t ideologically over-analyse whether the party should ally with Congress to take on BJP.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113307947,imgsize-648270,width-400,resizemode-4/113307947.jpg"

Viewed as a veiled threat, the party eventually announced Vikash as the nominee from Kalayat a day later. The other aspirant Shweta Dhull bitterly posted on X, ""A king's son becomes the king, that's the truth.""On the last day, Pooja Chaudhry, wife of Ambala MP Varun Chaudhry, got the Congress nomination from Mulana reserved constituency. Left out in the process, sources said, was Karamvir Singh Baudh, chairman of SC/ST/OBC confederation of employees. Baudh was appointed the coordinator for Dalit outreach for elections by AICC general secretary Deepak Babaria.Meanwhile, Chitra Sarwara who did not get the nod from Ambala Cantt because her father is contesting from the neighbouring turf, has filed the papers as independent.

Ticket denials spark Haryana BJP revolts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ticket-denials-spark-haryana-bjp-revolts/articleshow/113307528.cms,"NEW DELHI: Rebellion by functionaries who have been denied tickets and unprecedented public criticism of the leadership have added to the tough challenge BJP was already facing in Haryana because of a decade of incumbency.The washing of dirty organisational linen in public follows the dip in the party's fortunes since the 2019 elections when it swept the 10 Lok Sabha seats despite having been in office for five years in a state which was never its stronghold.Factors which helped the party in 2019, mainly PM Modi's popularity, failed to stop BJP from losing majority and it was forced to take the support of Dushyant Chautala 's JPP to form the govt. Signs of fatigue were visible in the LS polls when the party could win only five seats. If this was not worrisome enough, the outbreak of dissidencehas aggravated matters.Soon after BJP announced its second list of 21 candidates, several prominent leaders quit the party which included former deputy speaker Santosh Yadav, state BJP spokesperson Satyavrat Shastri and state executive committee member Shiv Kumar Mehta. In its second list, the party dropped five-time MLA from Mahendragarh Ramvilas Sharma , who will now contest as a rebel candidate.Union minister and Gurgaon MP Rao Inderjit Singh, who has been vocal against the state leadership even as his daughter Arti Singh Rao has been fielded from Ateli, came out in Sharma's support. Bhiwani-Mahendragarh MP Dharambir Singh was present with Rao when he addressed a gathering in Mahendragarh with Sharma.BJP has dropped around one-third of MLAs and some state leaders have claimed that CM Nayab Saini had a ""limited role"" in selection of candidate.Party leader Karan Dev Kamboj said the rebellion could have been prevented if Saini had a say in the allocation process. Kamboj, a former minister, had last week stepped down as the state unit's OBC Morcha chief after being denied ticket.On Tuesday, state unit vice-president Santosh Yadav quit, saying grassroots leaders who had been loyal to the party were being neglected.

Demolition definite, if found illegal: Minister

It's govt's failure: LOP

SHIMLA : Defying prohibitory orders, thousands of protesters seeking demolition of an allegedly illegally constructed mosque in Sanjauli area of the state capital clashed with the police on Wednesday. The police had to resort to mild lathi charge besides using water cannons to disperse them after they broke barricades and pelted stones.A few protesters as well as cops were injured during the police action and they were taken to hospital for treatment.Various Hindu outfits, including the Hindu Jagran Manch, went ahead with their planned protest at Sanjauli despite Shimla district magistrate's prohibitory orders issued on Tuesday barring gathering of five or more persons and deployment of heavy police force in the area. Initially, protesters from Shimla and nearby districts carrying national flags and raising slogans "" Jai Shri Ram "" and ""Hindu Ekta Zindabad"" gathered at Dhalli Sabzi Mandi, from where they started marching towards the disputed five-storey mosque in Sanjauli.They first broke the police barricades erected near the Dhalli tunnel to march ahead but the police had to resort to cane charging and use water cannons after they broke the second line of barricades to reach the mosque.The police also had to detain a few miscreants and by 4 pm, shops started opening in the Sanjauli market as the situation became normal and the police also withdrew some of its personnel from the area.Many school students had to face harassment due to the ongoing protest and some of the schools had to hold back students in the school premises till the situation became normal.Himachal public works minister Vikramaditya Singh said on Wednesday if the Shimla municipal commissioner's court finds the mosque's construction illegal, it would definitely be demolished but the state govt is bound to follow the rule of law.The minister said that he had already made it clear in the vidhan sabha with complete facts of the case. He asserted the Congress govt is very sensitive towards the cause of the state's people and it stands with them rock solid. He added that the case regarding illegal construction of the mosque is pending for the last 10 years in the Shimla municipal commissioner's court during which the BJP ruled the state for five years and Shimla's mayor had also been from the BJP as well as the CPI(M). The case is listed for next hearing on October 5.Stating that there had been an attempt to paint a different picture in this episode at the state as well as the national level, the minister clarified that it is a matter of fact that Himachal was the first state in the country to implement an anti-conversion law in 2006 when his father, Virbhadra Singh was the chief minister of a Congress govt. The Congress govts have sanctioned crores for the construction and renovation of temples across the state, he asserted. ""We can have our sentiments. I am proud to be a Sanatani. I am proud to be a Hindu and I have gone to Ayodhya on January 22 to seek blessings of Prabhu Shri Ram. But the govt's action has to be within the ambit of law,"" he cleared, adding that Himachal is not a banana republic.Former chief minister and the leader of opposition Jai Ram Thakur said the use of force and water cannons on the people protesting for their genuine demands was very unfortunate. He added that when it was known that the mosque's construction was illegal, then the appropriate action should have been taken rather than trying to hurt public sentiments by talking of dealing with them strictly.He said that the state govt took this issue with extreme insensitivity and the legally required action was not taken under the Congress high command's pressure. Thakur said that it was a failure of the entire intelligence system as huge crowds from all over the state gathered in Sanjauli.",Thousands of protesters seeking demolition of an allegedly illegally constructed mosque in Sanjauli area of the state capital clashed with the police on Wednesday.

""Rahul Gandhi should apologise. He used foreign soil to defame India and made a statement suggesting that Sikhs are not allowed to wear their turbans or visit gurdwaras,"" Singh told ANI.The protesters accused Rahul of 'humiliating' the Sikh community and held the Congress party ‘responsible’ for the 1984 anti-Sikh riots.This comes after a practicing lawyer at the Supreme Court Vineet Jindal filed a complaint with against the Congress leader for his remarks.""The statement of Rahul Gandhi is not right, and there have been no incidents reported where any Sikh is being stopped from visiting a Gurdwara or to wear the turbans, but Rahul Gandhi, for his political benefit, is trying to instigate the minorities. Earlier also, we witnessed how Rahul Gandhi defameed his own country instead of attacking the central government,"" Jindal said.""I have complained to Union home minister Amit Shah, NIA, and Delhi Police Commissioner. In which I have urged all of them to register the case for making false and inciteful statements. I have also urged them to cancel Rahul Gandhi's passport. I believe that soon action will be taken on my complaint,"" he added.During a recent gathering of Indian Americans in Washington, DC, Rahul Gandhi criticised the RSS for promoting a divisive agenda that considers certain religions, languages, and communities ‘inferior’ to others.In a moment that has since drawn significant criticism, Rahul addressed a Sikh attendee at the event, asking, ""What is your name, brother with the turban?"" He went on to say, ""The fight is about whether a Sikh is going to be allowed to wear his turban in India, or a kada. Or if, as a Sikh, he will be able to go to a gurdwara. That's what the fight is about. And not just for him, but for all religions.""The BJP has since denounced these remarks, accusing Gandhi of creating a ""dangerous narrative"" by discussing sensitive issues on an international platform and undermining India's unity.",Sikh leaders from Delhi BJP's Sikh cell staged a protest against leader of opposition and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi.

BJP hits back at opposition

NEW DELHI: Major political row erupted after Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the residence of Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud for Ganesh Puja.Several opposition leaders have criticized the meeting, suggesting that it may raise doubts about the independence of the judiciary. The BJP , however, has strongly defended the Prime Minister's visit, calling the opposition's criticism ""unfortunate"". PM Modi on Wednesday visited the residence of CJI on the occasion of Ganesh festival and offered prayers. A video showed Chandrachud and his wife Kalpana Das welcoming Modi at their house.PM also shared a picture on X, showing them praying together, and expressed his wishes for happiness, prosperity, and good health.""Joined Ganesh Puja at the residence of CJI, Justice DY Chandrachud Ji. May Bhagwan Shri Ganesh bless us all with happiness, prosperity and wonderful health,"" the Prime Minister said.Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut questioned the appropriateness of the meeting, stating that people may have doubts if the guardians of the Constitution meet political leaders.“Our case is going on before CJI Chandrachud. We have doubts whether we will get justice because the Centre is a party in our case and the (central) government is headed by the prime minister,” Raut said.“The CJI has repeatedly said that the government is unconstitutional but still a judgment is not given despite his retirement is nearing. Amid this, the prime minister has reached his residence. There is doubt in the minds of people when “protectors of the Constitution meet political people”, he added.Rajya Sabha MP Kapil Sibal said those who held the highest office should not publicise a private event.""I saw something being circulated on social media and, quite frankly, I was taken aback. I have been in the Supreme Court and in this institution for over 50 years. I have seen the greatest of judges, both past and present, and we are passionate about the institution.""""I have great respect for the present Chief Justice. I can say without any hesitation that he is a man of great personal integrity. I was really surprised when I saw this clip that was going viral,"" he said at a press conference.Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Priyanka Chaturvedi also took a dig at the Prime Minister's visit, linking it to the upcoming elections.""After the festivities are over hopefully CJI will deem fit and be slightly freer to conclude the hearing on Maharashtra and the blatant disregard of Article 10 of the Constitution in Maharashtra. Oh wait, elections round the corner anyway, it can be adjourned for another day,"" she said.NCP (SP) Working President Supriya Sule said that when she learnt of the development.""Both - PM and CJI - are senior to me in terms of age and experience, so it will not be appropriate to comment."" ""But such an incident (PM visiting CJI's house) was unheard of. I was also surprised, but I have full faith in courts and the respected CJI might have given it a thought before (inviting the PM),"" she told reporters in her constituency Baramati.Manoj Jha, an RJD leader and Rajya Sabha MP, told news agency PTI that the independence of every institution should not only be theoretical but also visible."" Ganpati puja is a personal issue, but you are taking a camera. The message it sends is uncomfortable. The Chief Justice of India and the Prime Minister are tall personalities. So what can we say if they agreed to put out these photographs in the public domain,"" he said.BJP leaders strongly defended the Prime Minister's visit, emphasizing that it was a devoted Ganesh Puja and not mere socializing.Shiv Sena Rajya Sabha MP Milind Deora criticized the opposition's comments, labelling them ""reckless"" and ""irresponsible"".""When verdicts favour them, the opposition praises the Supreme Court's credibility, but when things don't go their way, they conveniently claim the judiciary is compromised,"" he said in a post on X.""This reckless attempt to undermine the credibility of the CJI by the opposition is not only irresponsible but also damaging to the institution's integrity. India's politics is taking an ugly turn,"" Deora said.BJP IT-cell chief Amit Malviya also hit back at BJP and accused Congress of having ""problem with Hindu festivals""""The entire Congress and Communist ecosystem is in a twist after Prime Minister Narendra Modi attend Ganpati Poojan at CJI D Y Chandrachud’s residence. The same suspects held it as an epitome of secularism when Dr Manmohan Singh hosted Iftar parties and then CJI would attend, he said in a post on X.""Their problem is not the civility and cordiality between the Prime Minister and the CJI, alone, but Ganesh Chaturthi. The Congress and the Communists have always had a problem with Hindu festivals and now they have a problem with Maharashtra also, which celebrates Ganesh Chaturthi with great fervour,"" he added.Union minister Bhupender Yadav said those who applaud the presence of Prime Ministers at Iftars but criticize Modi's participation in Ganesh Puja. He asserted that the executive and judiciary praying together before revered deities reflects the true strength of Indian secularism.""The same people who applaud and encourage presence of Prime Ministers at Iftars find their guts twisting and turning when they see PM Modi perform Ganpati Poojan at CJI DY Chandrachud’s residence,"" he said.""The executive and judiciary praying before Gods revered by crores of devotees across India reflects the real strength of Indian secularism. Deal with it,"" he added.Addressing the media at the BJP headquarters on Thursday, party national spokesperson Sambit Patra also reminded the opposition of the Iftar parties held during the UPA government's tenure.He recalled that during the UPA era, then-Prime Minister Manmohan Singh used to host Iftar parties, which the Chief Justice of that time also attended.""Did they not meet then? Didn't they sit at the same table and talk? That was also a festival (Iftar party), and this was also a festival (Ganpati Puja). So why object now? Why is there discrimination between these two festivals?"" he questioned.Patra expressed surprise that when the Prime Minister meets the Chief Justice, there is an objection, but there is no objection when Rahul Gandhi meets Ilhan Omar, a known critic of India and a supporter of Pakistan.""What do these people want? Do they want the pillars of democracy not to meet? Does attending an Aarti change the equations?"" the BJP spokesperson questioned.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the residence of Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud for Ganesh Puja.

Protestors demand to seal mosque

CM Sukhu to set up panel

NEW DELHI: Tension prevailed in Himachal Pradesh 's Sanjauli as protestors hit the roads on Wednesday against the alleged illegal construction of a mosque.Hindu groups, who had called for a bandh, came out on streets along with the people in the hill state as they were irked by the Shimla Municipal Corporation's slow pace in deciding the legality of the mosque's construction -- which has been pending since 2010.The case has been heard nearly 45 times, but the final decision on the matter is yet to come.The protest turned ugly when the agitators clashed with the police and removed barricades to enter the Dhalli tunnel that leads to the Sanjauli area, where the mosque stands. The cops pushed against the protesting crowds by resorting to lathi-charge and also used water cannons to disperse the gatherings.Himachal Pradesh minister Vikramaditya Singh , to persuade the enraged protestors, assured action once the decision on the matter comes and said the mosque ""will be demolished if it is found to be illegal""""This matter has been pending for a long period. As far as the construction of illegal buildings is concerned, the government has taken cognisance of it. I have also strongly said in the assembly that as soon as the decision comes on this within the ambit of law action will be taken, it will be demolished if it is found to be illegal,"" Singh said.The minister said the government will ""move ahead with the process of law"" and that an ""atmosphere of peace should prevail in Himachal Pradesh"".Several protesters complained that the government first denied them permission to hold a peaceful demonstration and now was arresting them.Vijay Sharma, one of the demonstration's leaders told news agency PTI that the police lathi-charge on the protesters led to the volatile atmosphere in the area.""We demand that the structure be sealed till the hearing is concluded, all outsiders coming to the state be registered and a vendor's policy formulated on a population basis with 95 per cent licence to Hindus,"" Sharma said.Many women also joined the protest and recited Hanuman Chalisa at Dhalli before breaking the barricades.Sunita, who was among the protesters, claimed police lathi-charged children as well.""We are neither from the Congress nor from the BJP, we are Hindus and want these street vendors out,"" she told PTI.Janvi, a student of Class 6 of SPM Public School in Sanjauli, the students were scared as they were stuck in the school due to the protest.""We were allowed to leave when our parents came to collect us,"" she added.Amid the protests against the illegal construction of the mosque, Himachal Pradesh chief minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu, on September 9, assured that his government will constitute a committee to frame a street vendors' policy and to issue licences only after their verification.The CM, on the concluding day of the 11-day monsoon session of the Himachal assembly, said either a cabinet sub-committee or a vidhan sabha committee will be constituted to address this issue since Congress and BJP were equally responsible for maintaining communal harmony in the state.He said the state had a history of various communities co-existing peacefully, but action will be taken as per law in case of any illegal activity.","Hindu groups, who had called for a bandh, came out on streets along with the people in the hill state.

Talking to reporters, he vowed to fight against PM Narendra Modi ’s “narrative of naya Kashmir”, and took a dig at NC vice-president Omar Abdullah, saying he was only concerned about coming to power.“PM Modi’s narrative of ‘naya Kashmir’ has miserably failed. That was proved by the people of my constituency on June 4. The vote for me was actually a referendum against Modi’s narrative… I will fight against his narrative of ‘naya Kashmir’ and for the peaceful resolution of the Kashmir issue till my last breath,” he said.Replying to a question about Omar, Engineer Rashid said Omar was fighting for the chair while his fight “is for my people”. “My fight is much bigger than what Omar Abdullah is fighting for. There is a difference between spending five years in London and spending this time in Tihar jail, where prisoners crave for medical attention,” said the Baramulla MP, who had defeated Omar in the parliamentary polls by over two lakh votes.Rashid said he would go to the people to unite them, and not to divide them. “If that’s a crime, I am proud to commit this crime again and again. If I will have to spend my entire life in Tihar for this crime, I am ready,” he said. “I won’t exploit my people. Let youth study, businessmen do business; leave politics to us.”BJP’s election in-charge for J&K, Ram Madhav, strongly responded to Rashid’s anti-Modi rhetoric. “This rank separatist, in jail for the last 5 years under UAPA for indulging in anti-India activities, is out on bail to further vitiate Valley politics. Look at the language… anti-Modi rants, restoring Article 370 , freeing terrorists from jails… no different from what Omar or Mehbooba or even others… — the Gupkar Gang — are saying. He wants to defeat Modi’s dream of ‘naya Kashmir’. We accept the challenge. Naya Kashmir’s march will go on unrelentingly,” Madhav said in a post on X.Reacting to Er Rashid’s release, Omar and PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti insinuated that he and his party were being propelled by BJP to weaken the mainstream parties in Kashmir.Talking to reporters in Kupwara, Omar said, “When Arvind Kejriwal was allowed to campaign, they (BJP) opposed the move and questioned how a person could be released from jail for electioneering, but today they welcomed the release of Er Rashid.”Mehbooba said Rashid’s release raised doubts, and wondered how AIP seemed to have no dearth of money even when its leader was behind the bars, while her party was struggling to fund campaign rallies. “I am surprised to see AIP carrying out huge rallies in vehicles. Who is funding AIP?” she asked, while speaking to reporters in Shopian.","Sheikh Abdul Rashid walked out of Tihar jail a day after he was granted interim bail by a Delhi court.
