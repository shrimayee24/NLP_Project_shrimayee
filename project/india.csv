CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court has ruled that the mere recovery of a weapon or bloodstains on an accused's clothes is not enough to prove guilt in a murder case. Emphasising the need for substantive evidence, the court held that such findings, without direct links to the crime, cannot establish that the accused committed the offence.The HC passed these orders while overturning death sentences of two persons convicted in the gang rape and murder of a 19-year-old woman eight years ago in Haryana's Sonipat district.According to the prosecution, on May 9, 2017, the accused abducted the victim in a car, raped her and then murdered her. The teenager's mutilated body was recovered in Rohtak on May 11, with as many as 15 injuries. Her mother alleged that accused Sumit had kidnapped her daughter.Following her statement, the accused were arrested and Sumit confessed to the police that he and his friend, Vikas Yadav, had committed the offence, the prosecution had claimed On Dec 19, 2022, Sonipat district court convicted and awarded death sentence to both appellants, who then challenged the capital punishment before the HC.Acquitting the accused of murder charges, the HC pointed out serious gaps and procedural lapses in collection and handling of DNA evidence sent to Forensic Science Laboratory in Karnal.A division bench of justices Gurvinder Singh Gill and Jasjit Singh Bedi passed these orders while allowing the appeal filed by the accused. Their counsel, Jasdev Singh Mehandiratta contended that the case was based on circumstantial evidence and the chain of circumstantial evidence was not complete to warrant conviction.""We are conscious of the heinous nature of the offence but at the same time, the prosecution must establish its case beyond reasonable doubt which it has been unable to do. In fact, from the evidence on record, there is no evidence of the deceased having been kidnapped, intoxicated, subjected to gangrape and thereafter murdered by none other than the present accused,"" held the bench.",Punjab and Haryana high court overturns death sentences of two persons convicted in the gang rape and murder of a 19-year-old woman eight years ago.

BHOPAL/JABALPUR: Madhya Pradesh HC has ordered an FIR under the Pocso Act against a man who filed a habeas corpus petition to find his ""missing"" minor daughter. When she was produced in court, however, she refused to go back to her father, accusing him of ""sexual advances"", and said she would rather live with her female friend with whom she had run away from home.The bench of Justice Atul Shreedharan and Justice Anuradha Shukla, in a recent order, sent the 17-year-old to Nari Niketan till she turns an adult. The court, however, said that the girl may have accused her father out of vendetta so police should not arrest him until necessary.The girl went missing in April. Her father filed a habeas corpus plea after police failed to trace her despite an FIR in which he named a person who might be keeping her ""hostage"". Following an HC directive, police tracked her down and produced her in court on April 21, 2025.In her statement before judges, she said her father had got her married to a person for Rs 1 lakh. She added that she doesn't want to live with her father because she doesn't feel safe. She alleged that he used to touch her inappropriately when she was asleep. He was always drunk and would misbehave with her, she said, adding she had runaway with a friend and wanted to live only with her.The court, in its April 25 order, noted that the girl had levelled serious charges against her father hence police should register a case . However, he should be arrested only when police are convinced that the girl's charges hold water following probe, the bench said. Till she turns 18, the girl will stay in a 'Nari Niketan'. After that, she would have the liberty to decide what she wants to do.","Madhya Pradesh HC has ordered an FIR under the Pocso Act against a man who filed a habeas corpus petition to find his ""missing"" minor daughter.

NAVI MUMBAI: A young couple who were caught on camera having sex in the back row of a fairly empty civic-run AC bus in Navi Mumbai last month were recently traced and fined Rs 2,000 each by a local court.They expressed remorse in court. The video had prompted the civic body to suspend the bus conductor for not being alert and failing to take action against the couple. He was later reinstated.The clip was shot by a motorist who spotted the couple—a delivery agent and a medical laboratory assistant—from a window of the bus. The conductor was said to have been seated in the front, along with a few passengers, and, therefore, didn't spot them.After Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation's transport wing filed a complaint at Kamothe police station, an FIR was lodged under Section 296 of BNS and Sections 110 and 117 of Maharashtra Police Act for obscenity in public and the couple were traced based on the video, said police inspector Prashant Tayade.","Couple caught on camera having sex in the back row of a civic-run AC bus in Navi Mumbai last month.
