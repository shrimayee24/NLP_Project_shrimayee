NEW DELHI: An FIR was filed on Tuesday against BJP leader Vinod Tawde amid cash-for-vote charges as the Election Commission took action based on a complaint lodged by Bahujan Vikas Aghadi (BVA). The district authorities in Palghar said that a police team comprising senior officials recovered Rs 9.93 lakh cash and some incriminating documents from the hotel where some BJP activists were allegedly distributing money. Tawde, however, has denied the charges. He was backed by the BJP which called the charges baseless and termed the incident a desperate bid by MVA ahead of polling on Wednesday.BJP leader Sudhanshu Trivedi said that the FIR was not related to cash-for-vote charge but was registered for MCC violations.The Tuling police in Nalasopara East registered FIR against BJP's Tawde under sections of the Representation of People’s Act.The action against Tawde came hours after after dramatic scene unfolded in Palghar's Nalasopara assembly constituency when workers from the Bahujan Vikas Aghadi created a commotion outside a hotel where BJP national general secretary Vinod Tawde was holding a meeting. The workers, led by BVA MLA Kshitij Thakur, accused the BJP of distributing money.Meanwhile, Tawde cancelled a scheduled press conference in the evening after directives from the Election Commission (EC).Responding to the allegations, Tawde firmly denied the claims, emphasising his commitment to transparency. ""A meeting of MLAs from Nalasopara was underway to discuss the model code of conduct, sealing of voting machines, and handling objections. Appa Thakur and Kshitij misunderstood and thought we were distributing money,"" Tawde said.He called for an impartial investigation, adding, ""Let the Election Commission and Police inquire, and let them get CCTV footage. I have been in the party for 40 years. Appa Thakur and Kshitij know me, the entire party knows me. I believe the Election Commission should conduct a thorough investigation.""Talking to reporters later, Tawde said he was in Nallasopara to provide guidance regarding election procedures and not to distribute money. He further challenged opposition members to verify his activities.District collector and election officer Govind Bodke said the election department received complaints from BVA activists that some BJP workers were distributing cash at a hotel in Virar. Following this, the returning officer of Nalla Sopara and a police team, along with the joint police commissioner and two deputy police commissioners, searched the hotel and recovered Rs 9.93 lakh cash and some incriminating documents, the official said.The collector, in a recorded message, confirmed that cases were registered for offences, including possession of cash, violation of the model code of conduct, and holding illegal press conferences. The police were probing into the crimes, he said, without revealing against whom these offences were registered.Leaders of the opposition MVA demanded a comprehensive investigation by the Election Commission, with Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut suggesting a conspiracy against Tawde by some BJP leaders.Speaking to reporters,alleged that Tawde came to Virar with Rs 5 crore to influence voters. ""Some BJP leaders informed me that BJP general secretary Vinod Tawde is coming to Virar to disburse Rs 5 crore to influence voters. I thought a national leader like him would not stoop to such a trivial task. But I saw him here. I urge the Election Commission to take action against him and the BJP. The hotel’s CCTV recording was initially deactivated, showing complicity,"" Thakur claimed.The BVA legislator alleged the hotel Tawde was staying had shut CCTV recording. ""The hotel administration seems to be in cahoots with Tawde and the BJP. They only activated their CCTV after we requested it. Tawde was distributing money to manipulate voters,"" he said.A purported video of the altercation between Tawde and BVA leaders has surfaced on social media, fueling the controversy.also weighed in, saying, ""The BJP's scheme has come to an end. Thakur has done what the Election Commission should have done. EC officials search our bags and scrutinise us, yet these individuals from the BJP face no such checks.""Raut further said, ""No matter how much the BJP tries to hide, whatever happened in Nallasopara-Virar, it happened before the camera."" He also pointed out Tawde's substantial cash reserves, alleging he has the names of 18 people who disburse money with police escorts.He expressed concern over the implications of Tawde being caught, claiming that prominent BJP leaders, including state home minister Devendra Fadnavis, were aware of his activities.Raut said if the Election Commission had been unbiased, its officials would have conducted raids.alleged that Tawde distributed money to voters in Palghar district.added, ""Vinod Tawde should get a PhD, he is being hailed (sarcastically) for dismantling governments in few states, and forming BJP governments in few states, what is the real reason? This is BJP's 'note jihad', it is like distributing money and winning. Now we have to see what election commission does? It should not be done away by putting a case, there should be an action.""Calling for an action by the Election Commission of India against Tawde, Thackeray further said, ""Based on the evidence, action should be taken. Otherwise, Maharashtra will take action on its own.""“In one of the videos, the person prominently seen wearing saffron attire is BJP National General Secretary Vinod Tawde, from whom a large sum of money has reportedly been recovered,” said. “He was caught in the Virar East area with a black bag containing Rs 5 crore in cash and a diary listing details of Rs 15 crore. This raises serious questions, especially ahead of the elections.”Election Commission officials conducted a raid at the Virar hotel where Tawde was holding a meeting.said, “There are videos showing loads of cash, probably amounting to Rs 5 crore. A diary found at the scene names those who received the money. This is a blatant attempt to buy votes. The EC must act immediately to ensure a free and fair election.”Chaturvedi further alleged, “Truckloads of money from Gujarat and Delhi entered Maharashtra unchecked. This raid wasn’t conducted by the EC but by the people and a rival candidate. The BJP is trying to win elections using money, undermining democratic principles.”expressed shock. “It is shocking that a national leader of such a big party is distributing money. This is very dangerous for any democracy. If people want to get elected by distributing money, what should people like us do? Is there morality in this country or not? I publicly condemn this act, and it should be investigated,” she said.demanded arrests. “Whenever money is recovered in Maharashtra, it often links back to the BJP. If this is proved, Vinod Tawde and his associates should be arrested. This is not just a violation of election norms but a mockery of democracy.”accused the BJP of misusing government machinery and indulging in corrupt practices, including distributing money to buy votes, fearing a defeat in the upcoming state assembly elections.Speaking to the media, Patole criticised the BJP for using money power to manipulate the electoral process, arguing that this is an attempt to win the election through corrupt means, fearing a resounding defeat.He said, ""The Election Commission must ensure a fair and transparent election process. However, the series of events over the past month, including biased actions against opposition leaders, have raised concerns. Bags of opposition leaders have been checked under suspicious circumstances, and they've been prevented from flying in helicopters or airplanes, but no such scrutiny has been applied to the ruling party.""Responding to claims that Tawde was caught with Rs 5 crore in cash at a Virar hotel,dismissed the charges as baseless. “Today in Maharashtra, Maha Vikas Aghadi is making a desperate attempt to influence the atmosphere by making absurd accusations,” said Trivedi.He explained that Tawde, who oversees the party’s operations, was in the Nalasopara area meeting candidates to discuss election preparations. “He asked them to come to a hotel on the highway for a brief discussion. In the meantime, the Bahujan Vikas Aghadi candidate came there and began raising concerns about this,” Trivedi added.Trivedi emphasized that the meeting took place in a public space and urged authorities to verify the allegations using CCTV footage. “It is clear from our side that this incident happened in a hotel and not at a private location. If Rs 5 crore was carried, there must be some visual evidence of such a huge amount being transported.”also dismissed the allegations as a ""publicity stunt."" He said, ""The MVA has already lost the game. They are destined for defeat in this election, which is why they are making such absurd allegations against us. What Thakur is doing is nothing more than a publicity stunt.""termed the accusations a “pre-planned conspiracy” by the opposition to tarnish the party’s image ahead of the Maharashtra Assembly elections.Bawankule rejected claims that Tawde was caught with Rs 5 crore in cash at a Virar hotel, saying, “A film was made, and media management was also done. Accusations were made that Tawde came to distribute crores. Vinod Tawde is the party’s national general secretary. One needs to think if a man in such a position will go around distributing money.”He further alleged that the opposition, aware of its imminent defeat, orchestrated the incident to defame the BJP and its leadership.The incident comes as Maharashtra heads into the final stages of its high-stakes Assembly elections. With campaigning wrapped up on Monday, voting is scheduled for Wednesday, November 20, followed by counting on November 23.The polls will decide the fate of the 288-seat Maharashtra Assembly, with the BJP-led Mahayuti alliance and Congress-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) locked in a fierce battle.

According to Patil, cryptocurrency funds were also utilised during Lok Sabha polls in Maharashtra.Patil claimed one Gaurav Mehta, who he said was a witness in the case against him who worked for an audit firm named Sarathi Associates, had revealed bitcoin wallets were manipulated under direction of Gupta, the then police commissioner of Pune, and the funds were used in both Lok Sabha and assembly polls.Patil further claimed he was in possession of voice recordings from Mehta and said, ""Supriya Sule has sent three voice note messages in which she is heard asking Gaurav Mehta to encash bitcoins as the funds are needed for the polls. She is also heard assuring him not to worry about inquiries and one they come to power, they will handle them."" The audio was played at Trivedi's presser.The BJP functionary claimed ""bigger people"" were involved, hinting at a broader network of corruption. ""The conversation refers to a dealer named Gaurav Mehta, along with a mention of a Mr Gupta... We want to ask Supriya Sule whether she has any connection with Gaurav Mehta or this Mr Gupta?"" he asked. Trivedi also posed five questions to MVA and Congress: ""Are you involved in bitcoin transactions? Are you in contact with this person named Gaurav Gupta or Mehta? Are the chats yours (of your leaders) or not? Is the audio in the audio clips yours or not? Who are the 'big people'?""","BJP accused MVA, including Congress's Maharashtra president Nana Patole and NCP (SP)'s Supriya Sule of being involved in ""illegal bitcoin activities"" Sule refuted the claims and said ""spreading false information to manipulate voters was a familiar tactic""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115463368,imgsize-1170800,width-400,resizemode-4/115463368.jpg"
Maharashtra votes for 288 seats in single phase: What's at stake?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maharashtra-assembly-elections-votes-for-288-seats-in-single-phase-whats-at-stake/articleshow/115457717.cms,"(With agency inputs)

NEW DELHI: All 288 seats in Maharashtra are set to vote for assembly elections on Wednesday in a single phase. Along with Maharashtra, Jharkhand will also vote for 38 seats in the second and final phase.In Maharashtra, it's a high-stakes battle for the two major alliances, Eknath Shinde-led Mahayuti which is currently in power, and Maha Vikas Agadi (MVA).Since 2019, when the last assembly was held, the state has seen two major splits with Ajit Pawar and Eknath Shinde splitting Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Shiv Sena respectively. This election will therefore see a blockbuster contest of Sena vs Sena and Pawar vs Pawar where the parties fight for popular mandate and legacy.The incumbent BJP-led Mahayuti alliance seeks to maintain their control, whilst the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition aims to regain power in the state. The electoral contest features 4,136 candidates, including 2,086 independents. In Mahayuti, the BJP is competing in 149 constituencies, Shiv Sena in 81, and the Ajit Pawar-led NCP has nominated candidates for 59 seats.On the other hand in MVA, Congress has nominated 101 candidates, whilst Shiv Sena (UBT) has 95 contestants, and NCP (SP) is represented by 86 candidates. Meanwhile, the Bahujan Samaj Party has fielded 237 candidates, whilst the All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM) is contesting in 17 constituencies of the 288-member assembly.The two Pawars, Shinde and Thackeray are locked in a fierce contest for political legitimacy. The outcome of the 288-member Maharashtra Assembly election, scheduled for announcement on November 23, could potentially end the political careers of two contestants.Sharad Pawar, approaching his 84th birthday, seeks to deliver another decisive victory against his nephew's faction, which the Election Commission recognised as the legitimate Nationalist Congress Party. Ajit Pawar, following his setback in the Lok Sabha elections, aims for a comeback.The Lok Sabha results provided encouragement to both Thackeray, leading Shiv Sena (UBT), and chief minister Shinde, whose group received recognition as the authentic Shiv Sena. The assembly election now stands as a decisive contest.The performance of these four regional leaders will influence the political strategies of national parties.The factional rivalry intensifies with Shiv Sena claimants competing in over 51 constituencies, whilst Pawar faction candidates face off in approximately 36 seats.Party workers reference ""Mumbai ka king kaun"", highlighting the contest for dominance over Mumbai, previously controlled by the unified Shiv Sena.Western Maharashtra witnesses the most intense uncle-nephew competition, particularly in the Pawar family's stronghold.Sharad Pawar, having served four terms as chief minister, calls for defeating 'betrayers', targeting Ajit Pawar's group. The nephew maintains restraint in his rhetoric, mindful of public sympathy towards his uncle following the Lok Sabha results.NCP (SP) secured eight Lok Sabha seats compared to NCP's one, whilst Shiv Sena (UBT) won nine seats against Sena's seven.Campaign narratives ranged from opposition's focus on economic challenges and alleged discrimination to the ruling alliance's emphasis on welfare programmes and Hindutva agenda.The Saturday results will determine both popular support for competing agendas and the political survival of Maharashtra's key political figures.","All 288 seats in Maharashtra are set to vote for assembly elections on Wednesday.

'Who sent you money in tempo?': Rahul Gandhi's 'Safe' attack on PM Modi over cash-for-vote charges on Vinod Tawde,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/who-sent-you-money-in-tempo-rahul-gandhi-safe-attack-on-pm-modi-after-charges-on-vinod-tawde/articleshow/115451958.cms,"'Baatenge aur jitenge'

Tawde denies any wrongdoing, BJP alleges conspiracy



NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi after senior BJP leader Vinod Tawde was caught in ""cash-for-votes"" row on the eve of Maharashtra assembly elections. An FIR has been lodged against Tawde after Bahujan Vikas Aghadi (BVA) chief Hitendra Thakur accused the BJP national general secretary of distributing money to voters in Palghar.Rahul reacted sharply to the controversy and used it to continue with his digs at PM Modi's ""ek hain to safe hain"" poll pitch. ""Modiji, from whose 'SAFE' did these 5 crores come? Who looted the public's money and sent you in the tempo?"" the Congress leader posted on X.The Congress leader had on Monday mocked PM's 'Ek hai toh safe hai' poll pitch and claimed there was a link between the slogan and the Dharavi redevelopment project being given to the Adani Group.Rahul had brought a metal safe at the press conference and pulled out two posters from it. One poster featured a picture of industrialist Gautam Adani and PM Modi with the caption ""Ek hai toh Safe hai,"" and another showed a map of the project.The ""Ek hai toh safe hai"" slogan primarily serves to help Adani acquire Rs one lakh crore worth of land through the Dharavi redevelopment project, he had alleged.Tawde responded to Congress leader's jab and invited him to Nalasopara to check the CCTV footage himself and prove the allegation ""cash-for-votes"".Taking to X, Tawde said, ""Rahul Gandhi ji, you yourself come to Nalasopara, see the CCTV footage of the hotel, see the entire proceedings of the Election Commission held there and prove that the money came in this manner.""""If making such a statement without any information isn't childishness then what is?"" he added.Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray also took a ""note jihad"" jibe at BJP and demanded strict action by the Election Commission.Uddhav said that merely merely registering a case against Tawde won't suffice.""Is this BJP's note jihad (for votes)? 'Baatenge aur jitenge' (will distribute cash to win). Entire Maharashtra has seen it (a video showing bundles of cash). Maharashtra will decide tomorrow,"" Thackeray told reporters, taking a swipe at the 'Batenge toh Katenge' (divided we fall) slogan raised by UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath and ""vote Jihad"" claims.""Tawde was lauded for toppling governments in some states and helping to form new ones. Now the secret behind this has come out in the open,"" he added.Meanwhile, Tawde vehemently denied any wrongdoings and said that ""everything is on the record in full public and media view plus the CCTV cameras of the hotel"". The BJP claimed that allegations against its senior leader were baseless and alleged a conspiracy by a ""desperate"" opposition ahead of tomorrow's voting.""A meeting of MLAs of Nalasopara was underway. I went there to tell them about the Model Code of Conduct for the day of voting, how will voting machines be sealed, and how to go about if an objection has to be made. The workers of the party (Bahujan Vikas Aghadi), Appa Thakur and Kshitij thought that we were distributing money. Let the Election Commission and Police inquire, let them get CCTV footage. I have been in the party for 40 years. Appa Thakur and Kshitij know me, and the entire party knows me. Still, I believe that the Election Commission should conduct an impartial investigation,"" Tawde said.BJP MP and national spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi came out in Tawde's support and termed the allegations baseless. ""Vinod Tawde is our national secretary and is looking after several functions of the party ... The candidate of the (Nalasopara) constituency asked him to attend the meeting. He was passing from nearby, so he agreed. Such meetings are done to instruct the party workers regarding the polling process. We insist that the CCTV of the hotel and the nearby areas be checked... Rs. 5 crores cannot be brought in a pocket. It would be visible if someone were carrying it... They should show proof and not make baseless allegations,"" he said.","Vinod Tawde is accused of distributing money to voters in Palghar, Maharashtra.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra. Elections in Maharashtra will be held in single phase on November 20. The counting of votes will be on November 23.Maharashtra is gearing up for elections as the two major political alliances—the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) and the Mahayuti—prepare to face each other for the first time in a Vidhan Sabha election.The Maha Vikas Aghadi, comprise of the Congress, the Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray), and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) under Sharad Pawar, will go head-to-head with the Mahayuti , which includes the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Shiv Sena faction led by Eknath Shinde, and the NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar. This will be the first electoral contest between these two alliances since the splits within the Shiv Sena and NCP.The MVA is hopeful of replicating its recent Lok Sabha success, while the Mahayuti aims to retain power by leveraging its populist schemes targeted at women and youth. Both alliances have set their sights on winning the state.Narayan Rane, a former Union Minister and the victor in the Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg Lok Sabha constituency, is poised to be a key figure for the BJP in the Konkan region during the forthcoming elections. Meanwhile, two constituencies are expected to be critical battlegrounds: chief minister Eknath Shinde's Kopri-Pachpakdi seat in Thane City and Worli in Mumbai, where Aaditya Thackeray, a leader of the Shiv Sena (UBT), is seeking reelection.In the last Vidhan Sabha elections in 2019, the BJP secured 26.1% of the votes, the Congress 16.1%, the NCP 16.9%, and the Shiv Sena 16.6%. The BJP and the Shiv Sena (then united) formed the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which secured a majority. However, the coalition soon crumbled due to disagreements over government formation, plunging the state into a political crisis.After no party could establish a government, Maharashtra was placed under President's rule. Devendra Fadnavis was briefly sworn in as chief minister, with Ajit Pawar as deputy chief minister. However, both resigned just days later before a scheduled floor test.By November 28, 2019, a new coalition emerged, with the Shiv Sena (Uddhav faction), NCP (Sharad Pawar faction), and Congress forming the Maha Vikas Aghadi government, led by Uddhav Thackeray as chief minister.The state's politics took another turn in June, 2022, when Uddhav Thackeray resigned following a rebellion within the Shiv Sena, led by Eknath Shinde, who then allied with the BJP. Eknath Shinde assumed the role of chief minister, with Devendra Fadnavis returning as deputy chief minister.",The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra. Elections in Maharashtra will be held in single phase on November 20. The counting of votes will be on November 23.

Playing spoilsport? Rebel 'trouble' keeps both MVA and Mahayuti on tenterhooks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/playing-spoilsport-rebel-trouble-keeps-both-mva-and-mahayuti-on-tenterhooks/articleshow/115470409.cms,"More than 80 politicians left their parties to run as Independents in the assembly election. The BJP and Congress faced the most internal rebellion. The presence of strong Independent candidates could affect the election results.

PUNE: This assembly election has virtually become a ""house of rebels"".Over 80 politicians, miffed with their parties, have thrown their hat in the poll ring as Independents. The two parties contesting the highest number of seats in the Mahayuti and Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliances - BJP and Congress, respectively - have faced the biggest rebellion. Both have to counter challenges from rebels in Vidarbha, where they are in direct contest with each other.The presence of prominent rebels like former BJP MP Heena Gavit in Akkalkuwa constituency in the tribal-dominated Nandurbar district, where her family holds sway, or NCP minister Chhagan Bhujbal's son Sameer in his family's home turf of Nandgaon, and Jayashree Patil in Sangli could impact the poll outcome. Gavit and Sameer quit their parties, BJP and NCP, respectively, before joining the poll fray. ""There was immense pressure on me to contest from Nandgaon,"" said Sameer about his decision to contest as an Independent.BJP has taken action against 40 party members for contesting as Independents, terming their action ""anti-party activity"". Similarly, Congress has suspended 28 for contesting against the official alliance nominees. Congress, though, has MVA to support former corporator Rajesh Latkar in Kolhapur North after its official nominee pulled out of the race.Political analysts said there were two ways to look at the presence of many rebels and Independents in the poll ring. One is a part of theelectoral process , wherein the absence of local body elections for five years or more in some places have pushed up the aspirations of local bodies' leaders to enter the assembly. Second, a strategy to support a rebel or an Independent candidate to undermine the opposition.Political expert and former head of political science department at Shivaji University, Prakash Pawar, said, ""The aspirations of people can be seen here as there are rebels despite the presence of six political parties. It also shows the improved financial abilities to contest the elections.""He further said that Independents were also a part of the election management strategy of political parties. ""Each party wants to undermine the chances of wins of opponents and in some cases, even their alliance partners. They seem to have supported Independent candidates ,"" he added.Parties are confident that voters will align with their official nominees. BJP spokesperson Madhav Bhandari said voters would repose their faith in the official party candidates and rebels would not cause much harm. Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said rebellion was expected, but they managed to persuade most of the rebels to toe the party line. ""Party workers have their own aspirations and ambitions. Some of them have worked for at least five years for this opportunity. When there are three parties in alliance, it is difficult to accommodate everyone. We were expecting this rebellion,"" he said. ""We have taken action against the rebels. We feel we have succeeded in largely controlling the damage. We have placated them. Ultimately, they also want the MVA to form the govt. We don't think they will cause much damage.""",More than 80 politicians left their parties to run as Independents in the assembly election. The BJP and Congress faced the most internal rebellion.
