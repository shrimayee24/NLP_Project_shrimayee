"BJP, RSS eroding core values of statute: Rahul Gandhi",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-rss-eroding-core-values-of-statute-rahul-gandhi/articleshow/115035516.cms,"NAGPUR: Congress MP Rahul Gandhi launched an attack on BJP and RSS on its own turf in Nagpur, accusing them of eroding core values enshrined in the Constitution. Speaking at the ' Samvidhan Samman Sammelan ' on Wednesday, Gandhi demanded a caste census and scrapping of the 50% reservation cap, asserting these steps were essential for social justice.Challenging the RSS-BJP, Rahul claimed the Sangh avoids direct attacks on the Constitution to avoid public backlash, instead it uses narratives of ""development, progress and economy"" to mask its intent. ""Their covert actions weakened the rights of marginalised communities. If RSS opposes Constitution's principles, they should confront us openly,"" he said, questioning BJP's transparency.Central to Gandhi's speech was his demand for a national caste census, which he argued would reveal inequalities in access of resources and power among different communities. According to him, lack of such a census keeps disparities hidden. ""Caste census keeps Modi up at night,"" he alleged, noting the demand for a detailed count of marginalised groups exposes BJP's reluctance to acknowledge inequalities.Targeting RSS-backed educational institutions, including Shishu Mandirs and Eklavya Schools, Gandhi questioned their intent and funding. He expressed concern that these schools, acquiring significant land and resources, serve a political agenda rather than educational goals. ""Are funds for these schools coming from BJP-ruled states like Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, or from corporate giants like Adani and Ambani,"" he asked, alleging corporate and political motivations behind these expansions.In a rebuttal of Dy CM Devendra Fadnavis's remark that Gandhi had displayed a Constitution copy with a red cover rather than the traditional blue, Gandhi defended his choice, stating the colour symbolised dedication to the nation's foundational values.","Congress MP Rahul Gandhi demanded a caste census and scrapping of the 50% reservation cap.

J&K assembly passes resolution seeking dialogue with Centre on restoration of special status,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jk-assembly-passes-resolution-seeking-dialogue-with-centre-on-restoration-of-special-status/articleshow/115028558.cms,"This is a representational image (Pic credit: ANI)

SRINAGAR: J&K assembly passed a resolution introduced by National Conference (NC) Wednesday that calls on the Union govt to initiate discussions on the restoration of the former state’s special status — revoked in 2019 with the abrogation of Article 370 .Though the resolution reaffirms the importance of J&K’s distinct identity, culture, and rights, it does not explicitly mention Article 370.Deputy CM Surinder Choudhary introduced the resolution amid protests from BJP’s 28-member bloc. The resolution states: “This assembly calls upon the govt of India to initiate dialogue with elected representatives of the people of J&K for the restoration of special status , constitutional guarantees , and to work out the constitutional mechanisms for restoring these provisions.”BJP legislators protested the timing of the resolution, claiming it broke legislative protocol. Leader of the opposition Sunil Sharma accused CM Omar Abdullah’s coalition govt of violating assembly procedures, as the day’s agenda was set to discuss the lieutenant governor’s address. Despite repeated adjournments due to BJP’s protests, speaker Abdur Rahim Rather put the resolution to vote and it passed with a majority.CM Abdullah defended the resolution, asserting it was now the Centre’s responsibility to respond to the assembly’s call. NC MP Aga Ruhullah Mehdi stressed that the move was only a preliminary step: “The fight won’t stop here as only the doors have been opened today through the assembly.”The resolution found support from lawmakers outside the governing alliance, including three PDP members, three independents, and People’s Conference chief and party MLA Sajad Lone.However, independent legislator and imprisoned Baramulla MP Engineer Rashid’s brother Sheikh Khursheed of Awami Ittehad Party (AIP) expressed conditional support. “There is no mention of Article 370 or 35A, no reference to the J&K Reorganisation Act of 2019, and no commitment to reverse the measures imposed on August 5, 2019,” he said, calling the resolution an incomplete gesture that fell short of the election promises made by NC, PDP and Congress.The passage of the resolution followed a separate move by PDP legislator Waheed Para, who had introduced Monday a private member’s resolution calling for the restoration of Article 370. However, the proposal was disallowed amid protests by NC and BJP members.PDP president and former CM Mehbooba Mufti criticised the NC-backed resolution as “half-hearted” and “lacking conviction”, saying it should have forcefully condemned the abrogation of Article 370.“Today, PDP has shown that numbers don’t matter. A strong opposition can compel a majority govt to fulfil the people’s aspirations and honour its commitments to the public. This is the result of the PDP’s dedicated efforts,” Mehbooba said, claiming PDP’s persistent advocacy led to the resolution’s introduction.BJP was quick to condemn the move, accusing NC of pushing a divisive agenda. “This is a fake resolution and lacks legal validity,” said opposition leader Sunil Sharma, adding that “no one is above Parliament”.Parliament repealed Article 370 on Aug 5, 2019, ending J&K’s special status and restructuring the region into two Union territories — including Ladakh. The Supreme Court later upheld the parliamentary decision.BJP’s J&K chief Sat Sharma rallied supporters during a protest outside the party office, burning effigies of CM Abdullah and his deputy. “NC-Congress has a history of fooling people, and BJP will continue to protest against these nefarious designs,” Sharma said.Responding to the intense debate on J&K’s autonomy and protests against the resolution, J&K Congress president Tariq Hameed Karra questioned why dialogue with the Centre on constitutional guarantees and statehood should be seen as problematic.","J&K assembly passes resolution calling on Union govt to initiate discussions on the restoration of the former state’s special status.

The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections , which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases. The results will be declared on November 23, along with Maharashtra.In the Tribal-dominated state, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and CM Hemant's Soren Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) are in a direct fight, while the Congress party and Lalu Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) are in alliance with the JMM.The JMM-Congress-RJD alliance are also reportedly seeking to deal with Left parties, Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party and other tribal outfits that have been contesting the elections in the state as independent entities and make efforts to field candidates against the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) on all 81 seats collectively.In the last assembly polls in 2019, the JMM-Congress-RJD alliance won a comfortable majority of 47 seats in a House of 81.The BJP slipped to 25 seats from 37 it held in 2014. The poor performance was perceived to be the outcome of its decision to contest alone backfiring. The party did not foster an alliance with the Ajsu in the 2019 polls when Raghubar Das, currently the Odisha governor, was serving the state as CM.In this year's Lok Sabha polls in Jharkhand, the BJP-led NDA secured nine out of the 14 seats, with the BJP winning eight and its alliance partner, the Ajsu (All Jharkhand Students Union) Party, retaining its single seat.On the other hand, the opposition India bloc improved its tally, increasing its seat count from two in 2019 to five in the parliamentary polls.BJP and JMM have spruced up their pace of campaigning from the ground zero to social media. BJP and JMM leaders are actively rebutting and challenging each other on a range of issues, including illegal immigration, youth welfare, employment and housing.INDIA bloc parties in Jharkhand slammed the EC for holding assembly elections in the state along with that of Maharashtra but claimed that they were ready to slug it out with BJP-led NDA, which has welcomed the announcement of poll dates.JMM, Congress, and CPI (ML-L) said the announcement showed that EC was in a hurry to conduct elections though the assembly tenure was due to end in January next year.Also, both the INDIA bloc and BJP-led NDA are expected to get into huddles to discuss the modalities of seat-sharing which is going to be a challenge for both the competing teams.","The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections, which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases.

The counting of votes will be on November 23.Maharashtra is gearing up for elections as the two major political alliances—the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) and the Mahayuti—prepare to face each other for the first time in a Vidhan Sabha election.The Maha Vikas Aghadi, comprise of the Congress, the Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray), and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) under Sharad Pawar, will go head-to-head with the Mahayuti , which includes the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Shiv Sena faction led by Eknath Shinde, and the NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar. This will be the first electoral contest between these two alliances since the splits within the Shiv Sena and NCP.The MVA is hopeful of replicating its recent Lok Sabha success, while the Mahayuti aims to retain power by leveraging its populist schemes targeted at women and youth. Both alliances have set their sights on winning the state.Narayan Rane, a former Union Minister and the victor in the Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg Lok Sabha constituency, is poised to be a key figure for the BJP in the Konkan region during the forthcoming elections. Meanwhile, two constituencies are expected to be critical battlegrounds: chief minister Eknath Shinde's Kopri-Pachpakdi seat in Thane City and Worli in Mumbai, where Aaditya Thackeray, a leader of the Shiv Sena (UBT), is seeking reelection.In the last Vidhan Sabha elections in 2019, the BJP secured 26.1% of the votes, the Congress 16.1%, the NCP 16.9%, and the Shiv Sena 16.6%. The BJP and the Shiv Sena (then united) formed the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which secured a majority. However, the coalition soon crumbled due to disagreements over government formation, plunging the state into a political crisis.After no party could establish a government, Maharashtra was placed under President's rule. Devendra Fadnavis was briefly sworn in as chief minister, with Ajit Pawar as deputy chief minister. However, both resigned just days later before a scheduled floor test.By November 28, 2019, a new coalition emerged, with the Shiv Sena (Uddhav faction), NCP (Sharad Pawar faction), and Congress forming the Maha Vikas Aghadi government, led by Uddhav Thackeray as chief minister.The state's politics took another turn in June, 2022, when Uddhav Thackeray resigned following a rebellion within the Shiv Sena, led by Eknath Shinde, who then allied with the BJP. Eknath Shinde assumed the role of chief minister, with Devendra Fadnavis returning as deputy chief minister.",The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra. Elections in Maharashtra will be held in single phase on November 20. The counting of votes will be on November 23. This will be the first electoral contest between these two alliances since the splits within the Shiv Sena and NCP.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114248739,imgsize-47642,width-400,resizemode-4/114248739.jpg"
