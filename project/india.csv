Misspelt slogans led UP cops to suspects trying to frame Muslims





AGRA: Four men have been arrested in Aligarh for allegedly writing ""I love Muhammad"" on the walls of four temples to falsely implicate their Muslim neighbours over property dispute. Aligarh SSP Neeraj Jadon identified the four as Jishant Kumar, Akash Kumar, Dilip Kumar, and Abhishek Sarswat, all aged between 30 and 35.Police said the the fifth accused, identified as Rahul, is absconding.Police said the slogans were found scribbled on four shrines on Oct 25. A complaint was filed by a member of a right-wing organisation, naming Muslim men.Police rushed to the spot with senior officers, erased the graffiti and calmed the crowd. A case was then registered against Maulvi Mustaqeem, Gul Mohammad, Suleman, Sonu, Allabaksh, Hasan, Hamid and Yusuf,"" SSP Jadon said.But police soon noticed something odd. The slogans were misspelled, and all in the same way. The mistake didn't match the way I love Muhammad had appeared on banners during protests in Bareilly in September. That difference led investigators to suspect mischief.Police teams used technical surveillance to track down the actual culprits. A case under BNS was registered against the men, and they were sent to jail. SSP Jadon said police found the men had personal disputes with some of the Muslims they tried to frame.","Misspelt slogans led UP cops to suspects trying to frame Muslims over property dispute.

PATNA: Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday that fulfilling the dreams of Bihar's youth was the ""sankalp"" (resolve) of both ""Narendra and Nitish"", even as he attacked Congress MP Rahul Gandhi for allegedly insulting Chhathi Maiya (goddess).Addressing twin election rallies in Muzaffarpur and Chhapra, Modi wove together the promise of youth empowerment with sharp criticism of the opposition, accusing them of misleading voters and disrespecting Bihar's culture and faith.In Muzaffarpur, Modi questioned, ""Will Bihar and Hindustan forgive those who insulted even Chhathi Maiya for votes?"" He was referring to Rahul's recent remark that Modi could even dance on stage for votes and had done ""drama"" in the name of Chhath. ""While your son Modi is trying to get Chhath registered on the Unesco heritage list, Congress-RJD people are insulting Chhathi Maiya for votes.

""Our govt is connecting the treasures of Bihar with employment,"" he said.Modi said while NDA stood for ""padhai, kamai, davai and sichai"", the RJD-Congress symbolised ""katta, krurta, katuta, kushasan and corruption"".

SRINAGAR: CM Omar Abdullah urged NC’s newly elected Rajya Sabha members to speak up for J&K’s political rights, warning them not to “lose their voice in Delhi’s pollution” like some of their predecessors. “Sometimes Delhi’s pollution seems to affect our colleagues. We have sent many big names to Parliament in the past, but once they reached there, they appeared to lose their voice,” Omar said Thursday in Handwara.His pointed jab — mixing political frustration with a smog-laced metaphor — drew cheers from supporters in the border town, where he promised that this time, the voices sent to New Delhi “will not fall silent”.The CM’s remarks came amid growing dissent within NC, with two Lok Sabha MPs — Aga Ruhullah Mehdi and Mian Altaf Ahmad — accusing his govt of failing to deliver on political and governance promises.Omar said the three NC members elected to RS last Friday — Chaudhary Mohammad Ramzan, Sajad Ahmad Kichloo and Shammi Oberoi — would “truly represent the people” and press for restoration of statehood and constitutional rights in Parliament.BJP also won one seat, with Sat Sharma clinching victory after a close contest.Recalling that his grandfather Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah and father Farooq Abdullah had also sent J&K representatives to Parliament who “suffered the same fate”, Omar said this time he expected better. “I have faith the three members I am sending will become your voice in Parliament,” he said.Praising Ramzan as “the apt candidate”. Omar said despite “gerrymandering” in the Oct 2024 delimitation, Ramzan lost his assembly race by just 600 votes. “We are sending a strong voice to Parliament who will fight for J&K’s rights,” Omar said. “They will remind the Centre of the promises made — on industries, roads, rail links, tunnels — and of the assembly’s resolution seeking restoration of special status.”The comments followed open criticism from within his party. On Sunday, Anantnag–Rajouri MP Mian Altaf Ahmad said NC-led govt had failed to fulfil its commitments and that governance in the Union territory “needs improvement”.Srinagar MP Aga Ruhullah Mehdi has repeatedly accused the NC brass of soft-pedalling on BJP and neglecting its 2024 pledges. “In one year, where has our political fight gone? Where are the 100,000 jobs that were promised?” Mehdi asked recently, alleging the party had drifted from its campaign agenda.",Omar Abdullah urges NC's newly elected Rajya Sabha members to speak up for J&K's political rights.
