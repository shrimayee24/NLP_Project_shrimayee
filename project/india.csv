NEW DELHI: As the Tamil Nadu unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) prepares to welcome its next president , all eyes are on what the future holds for K Annamalai , the party's outgoing chief in the southern state.The retired Indian Police Service (IPS) officer, who resigned from service in 2019 and joined the BJP the following year, was appointed head of Tamil Nadu BJP in 2021.So, what's next for him?The most commonly accepted theory is that the 40-year-old will be relocated to Delhi to be inducted in the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led central government. In a social media post on Thursday, Union home minister and ex-BJP president Amit Shah lauded him for his ""unprecedented contribution"" and ""commendable accomplishments"" as the party's Tamil Nadu head.He could also be handed a key role within the party, with Shah's social media post noting that the ""BJP will leverage Annamalaiorganizational skills in the party's national framework.""The party is also set to get a new national president; the incumbent, Union health minister JP Nadda, is on an extension, having succeeded Shah in early 2020. On social media, some BJP supporters have called for Annamalai to be elevated as its new president. However, this is highly improbable as the post will to go to someone with years of experience.Annamalai could also be be tasked with working for the BJP in his home state, where it has traditionally been a weak player. In the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, the BJP contested 23 of the state's 39 seats but drew a blank. However, it recorded a vote share of 11%, up from 7.5% in the 2019 polls. The improved show came under Annamalai, who, however, lost from the Coimbatore constituency, where he was the runner up to Ganapathi Rajkumar of the ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam.He recently said, ""I am in politics for the sake of a single man, Prime Minister Narendra Modi ...whatever may be his command, I will follow that.""",K Annamalai was appointed head of Tamil Nadu BJP in 2021.

These renewed ties mark a breakthrough for BJP's attempts to expand NDA alliance by enlisting new allies, and a calculated respect for AIADMK.The two parties had contested together in 2019 Lok Sabha and 2021 assembly elections.

On including former AIADMK coordinator O Panneerselvam and AMMK general secretary TTV Dhinakaran, both of whom head splinter groups, in the alliance, Shah said: ""BJP will not interfere in the internal affairs of AIADMK.""The renewal of ties coincides with the strident DMK camp accusing BJP of seeking to impose Hindi and marginalise the South through delimitation.Asked whether Annamalai would be given a new post at the national level, he said the party would take a decision at the right time.Responding to a question on differences between AIADMK and BJP on issues such as NEET and the three-language policy, Shah said the differences will be sorted out before the assembly elections and a common minimum programme will be drafted.Earlier, Shah visited the residence of former Telangana governor Tamilisai Soundararajan to pay condolences on the death of her father and former TNCC president Kumari Ananthan.","Home minister Amit Shah announced BJP and AIADMK have decided to renew their alliance for the 2026 assembly elections in Tamil Nadu.

CM mourns ‘irreplaceable void’ in Bengal politics

From Left stalwart to Trinamool minister

NEW DELHI: Former West Bengal minister and veteran leader Abdur Razzak Mollah passed away at his ancestral home in South 24 Parganas on Friday morning.The 80-year-old Trinamool Congress leader, who had been ailing due to age-related complications, breathed his last at his residence in Bankri village in the Bhangar area, party sources confirmed.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee expressed deep grief over Mollah’s demise, recalling his contributions to Bengal’s rural and agrarian landscape.“I am saddened and shocked by the passing of my colleague, Abdur Razzak Mollah. He was my colleague in the state cabinet. I respected and honoured him,” Banerjee said on X.“His knowledge and experience in Bengal's rural life, agricultural economy and land reform were well-known. That's why, even though he once practised politics of a different ideology, it was easy and natural for him to join the 'Ma-Mati-Manush' government,” she said, calling his death an “irreplaceable void in the political life of Bengal.”Mollah served as the Minister for Land and Land Reforms during the Left Front regime and represented the Canning Purba seat from 1977 to 2011.
