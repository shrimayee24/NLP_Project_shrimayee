NEW DELHI: The Lok Sabha election results, which were unveiled on June 4, have yielded a fascinating tapestry of political outcomes in Telangana. The state, which boasts a total of 17 Lok Sabha seats, witnessed an intense battle between the BJP and the INC , with each party securing 8 seats. The AIMIM, led by the charismatic Asaduddin Owaisi , managed to retain its solitary seat.The party-wise vote share painted an intriguing picture, with the INC garnering 40.10% of the votes, closely followed by the BJP at 35.08%. The BHRS made a significant impact, securing 16.68% of the votes, while the AIMIM's share stood at 3.02%. The AIFB, BSP, CPI(M), and NOTA collectively accounted for a mere 1.21% of the votes, with other parties contributing 3.90%.In a remarkable feat, Asaduddin Owaisi, the President of the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM), retained the Hyderabad Lok Sabha seat with an unprecedented margin of over 3.38 lakh votes. This resounding victory marked Owaisi's fifth consecutive triumph, solidifying his position as a formidable force in Telangana politics. He vanquished his closest competitor, Kompella Madhavi Latha of the BJP, by an astounding 3,38,087 votes.The BJP made significant inroads in Telangana, with several of its prominent leaders emerging victorious. G. Kishan Reddy secured a resounding win in the Secunderabad Lok Sabha seat, while Eatala Rajender triumphed in the Malkajgiri constituency.

Modi government 3.0: Allies get 15% of cabinet berths; upper caste numbers at a low,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/modi-government-3-0-allies-get-15-of-cabinet-berths-upper-caste-numbers-at-a-low/articleshow/110854567.cms,"Narendra Modi Takes Oath As India's Prime Minister For Historic Third Consecutive Term

NEW DELHI: Narendra Modi was, on Sunday, sworn in as prime minister for the third time, equalling Jawaharlal Nehru’s record of three straight terms in the top office.With 71 members, his latest team is bigger than the previous two, and, contrary to speculations, he had little difficulty in putting the council of ministers , despitre leading a coalition govt. TDP and JD(U), in particular, chose not to be difficult as was speculated after voters denied BJP an absolute majority.Although portfolios have not been announced, the ease of ministry making is being seen as an indication that BJP may not have difficulty in retaining important ministries, not just home, defence, finance and external affairs, but also others crucial for ensuring continuity of policy trajectory.The exercise was marked by the inclusion of experienced players, including four former CMs, but wasn’t marked by high-wattage exclusions. The govt has seven former CMs, including Modi, and four who have been BJP chiefs.In terms of social composition, it carries forward the process of earmarking a progressively bigger share to ""non-reserved"" categories — SCs/STs and OBCs. The drop in strength of the ""general category contingent"" appears starker. It could paetly be thanks to many heavyweights losing in UP and Bihar. But the messaging from lower upper caste representation is significant in view of the losses BJP suffered because of the opposition's allegation that it was out to scrap quotas.There is a deviation also from the trend of progressively higher share for women, the departure setting off the buzz on early action on women's quota in legislatures. There are six women in the council with Nirmala Sitharaman and Annapurna Devi, who got a promotion, designated cabinet ministers.More striking, however, is the non-representation of Muslims; it is the first instance of a central govt taking office without any representative of the largest minority community on board.Including the 30 members with cabinet rank, it is the largest council of ministers since 2014, the increase resulting from the need to accommodate 11 from among BJP allies . J P Nadda, who will soon complete his tenure as BJP president, made a comeback in govt, paving the way for an organisational recast. Nadda’s entry also meant that Anurag Singh Thakur, MP from Hamirpur in Himachal, missed out, but is likely to get a prominent party post. Dharmendra Pradhan’s inclusion in the Union cabinet for the third straight time is a confirmation that the party will look for a legislator from Odisha to be sworn in as chief minister on Monday. Pradhan had looked the obvious frontrunner for the post in Bhubaneswar.Apart from BJP's Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Manohar Lal, former CMs of MP and Haryana respectively, the govt also boasts of two other former CMs in H D Kumaraswamy (JDS) and Jitan Ram Manjhi (HAM) to add to the bench strength. Among prominent allies, NCP opted out of the cabinet, at least for the time being, with its representative, former cabinet minister Praful Patel, publicly saying the offer of MoS was not acceptable to him because it would have meant a demotion.Overall, there were 33 first-time ministers, with seven of them from alliance partners, including TDP's K Rammohan Naidu and Chandra Shekhar Pemmasani, JD(U)'s Lallan Singh and Ram Nath Thakur, RLD’s Jayant Chaudhary, LJP’s Chirag Paswan and Kumaraswamy from JD(S). Naidu is the youngest cabinet minister at 36 years.The PM sought to strike a regional balance, while ensuring that states such as Maharashtra and Haryana, where elections are due, get adequate representation. Despite electoral setbacks in Uttar Pradesh, the state retains its primacy in terms of representation with 11 ministers, followed by Bihar (eight), Maharashtra and Gujarat (six each).The party think tank has also opted to go with those who have won their Lok Sabha seats, ignoring the claims of several candidates who lost the election, with Ravneet Singh ‘Bittu’ and L Murugan being exceptions. Murugan is the only member from Modi’s team from the previous term who has found a berth despite losing the election.Rajnath Singh (Lucknow), Gajendra Singh Shekhawat (Jodhpur), Jitendra Singh (Udhampur) and Kirti Vardhan Singh (Gonda) are the four ministers from Thakur community, which had a far bigger representation from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in first two terms of Modi govt.","With 71 members, his latest team is bigger than the previous two.

Mix of old hands and new faces

Full list of the new council of ministers:

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi took the oath of office for a historic third consecutive term at 7.15pm on Sunday along with his council of ministers in an over 3-hour-long grand ceremony at the Rashtrapati Bhavan .As per media reports, the new Cabinet is scheduled to hold its first meeting on Monday evening at the Prime Minister's Lok Kalyan Marg residence.Ahead of the swearing-in ceremony , PM Modi had hosted a high tea for the 71 would-be council of ministers (which include 30 Cabinet ministers, 5 Ministers of State-Independent Charge, and 36 Ministers of State). The portfolios of the ministers have not yet been announced.The PM Modi 3.0 council of ministers include representation from all corners of the country as well as social groups. It has 27 ministers from Other Backward Classes, 10 from Scheduled Castes, 5 from Scheduled Tribes and 5 from minorities. A record 18 senior Ministers will be heading ministries.Modi Cabinet 3.0 includes 43 ministers who have served 3 terms or higher in Parliament, with 39 having been ministers in central government before. The list includes multiple former chief ministers and 34 ministers who have served in state legislatures and 23 having worked as ministers in states.There are also 33 first-timers in the ranks. Seven first-time ministers in the Modi government belong to the allies: TDP's K Rammohan Naidu and Chandrasekhar Pemmasani; JDU's Lalan Singh and Ram Nath Thakur, RLD's Jayant Chaudhary, LJP's Chirag Paswan and HD Kumaraswamy of the JD(S).The new faces also include Suresh Gopi, the actor-turned-politician who scripted history by becoming the first BJP MP from Kerala.The first-timers from the BJP are Kamlesh Paswan (Uttar Pradesh), Sukanta Majumder (West Bengal), Durga Das Uikey (Madhya Pradesh), Raj Bhushan Chaudhary (Bihar), Satish Dubey (Bihar), Sanjay Seth (Jharkhand), C R Paatil (Gujarat), Bhagirath Chaudhary (Rajasthan), Harsh Malhotra (Delhi), V Somanna (Karnataka), Savitri Thakur (UP). Kamaljeet Sehrawat (Delhi), Prataprao Jadhav (Maharashtra), George Kurian (Kerala), Kirti Vardhan Singh (UP), Tokhan Sahu (Chhattisgarh), Bhupathi Raju Srinivasa Varma (Andhra Pradesh), Nimuben Bambhniya (Gujarat), Murlidhar Mohol (Maharashtra), Pabitra Margherita (Assam) and Bandi Sanjay Kumar (Telangana), are also among the BJP first-timers.BJP's NDA partners have got five cabinet ministerial berths in the third term of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as against none in the outgoing government, given the party's dependence on allies for a majority in the Lok Sabha. While the outgoing council of ministers had two ministers of state from BJP's allies -- Anupriya Patel of the Apna Dal (S) and Ramdas Athawale of the RPI(A) -- this time, there are two ministers of states with independent charge and four ministers of state (MoS).As per the Constitution of India, the total strength of the council of ministers cannot exceed 15% of the total number of Lok Sabha MPs. The strength of the 18th Lok Sabha is 543 members and hence the council of ministers cannot be more than 81.The 2024 Lok Sabha election results were announced by the Election Commission of India on June 4, the BJP won 240 seats and the Congress 99 seats. BJP had won 303 seats in the 2019 general elections and 282 seats in the 2014 general elections.The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) unanimously passed a resolution to elect Narendra Modi as their leader on June 5.Several leaders and State heads of neighbourhood region and Indian Ocean region were invited for PM Modi's swearing-in ceremony as distinguished guests.After the last reshuffling of portfolios in the previous Modi government, the council of ministers had comprised the PM and 78 ministers, including 29 Cabinet Ministers, 3 Ministers of State (Independent Charge) and 47 Ministers of State.","PM Narendra Modi takes oath of office for historic third consecutive term, equals Jawaharlal Nehru's record.

"In a first, no Muslim takes oath as minister",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-a-first-no-muslim-takes-oath-as-minister/articleshow/110854291.cms,"NEW DELHI: This is perhaps the first time that no Muslim MP took oath as minister after the election. Interestingly, the outgoing council of ministers did not have a Muslim minister after Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi was not re-elected to Rajya Sabha.The composition of the council of ministers sworn in after every general election had at least one Muslim MP in it. In 2014, when PM Narendra Modi took oath for the first time, Najma Heptulla was sworn in and was made minority affairs minister. In 2019, Naqvi was sworn in and he too became minority affairs minister.One of the reasons for no Muslim representation in this council of ministers is that no Muslim candidate from NDA allies got elected to the 18th Lok Sabha. Of the 24 Muslim MPs elected to the lower House, 21 are from the INDIA bloc and the remaining are Asaduddin Owaisi of All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen and two Independents — Abdul Rashid Sheikh or ‘Engineer Rashid’ and Mohmad Haneefa from J&K.The council of ministers of 2004 and 2009 had four and five Muslim MPs respectively. Even in 1999, the Atal Bihari Vajpayee govt had two Muslims in the council of ministers — Shahnawaz Hussain and Omar Abdullah. In 1998, the Vajpayee-led ministry had Naqvi as minister of state.","The outgoing council of ministers did not have a Muslim minister after Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi was not re-elected to Rajya Sabha.

BHUBANESWAR: V K Pandian , who quit the IAS last November to join BJD and quickly graduated from ex-CM Naveen Patnaik's trusted bureaucratic aide to rumoured political heir, ended his innings in politics just as swiftly on Sunday with a statement saying he was ""sorry if the campaign narrative against me has had a part to play for BJD's loss"".""I have consciously decided to withdraw myself from active politics...I apologise to the Biju family and all workers of BJD. My only intent of joining politics was to assist my mentor Naveen Patnaik,"" said Pandian, who had declared at a rally that he would quit politics if BJD didn't return to office with a three-fourths majority.Tamil Nadu-born Pandian's resignation caps a week of setbacks for BJD, with Naveen missing out on a sixth consecutive term in office and the party drawing a blank in the Lok Sabha poll. The former bureaucrat, whom BJP repeatedly targeted during the campaign as a threat to ""Odia asmita"" (identity), is copping much of the blame for his party's electoral debacle, although his mentor has stood by him.In what could be more than a coincidence, Naveen's nephew Arun Patnaik landed in Bhubaneswar on Saturday, sparking a buzz about the BJD baton being passed within the family. Naveen recently clarified that he hadn't anointed Pandian as his political successor, saying the people of Odisha would choose who should wear that hat.Pandian joined politics on November 27 last year, a month after taking voluntary retirement from the IAS. He would go on to play the lead role in BJD's campaign amid allegations that Naveen had left all crucial decisions to him.Pockets of resistance to Pandian getting precedence within BJD over those from the state played a role in the party's strength in the 147-member assembly dwindling to 51. BJP won 78 seats.In a four-minute video, his first since the June 4 poll verdict, Pandian appeared to accept responsibility for BJD's dismal show.","V K Pandian quit the IAS last November to join BJD and quickly graduated from trusted bureaucratic aide to rumoured political heir.

While Ajit Pawar and Patel have accepted NDA's contention, they have decided ""to wait till remedial measures are taken as early as possible.""After a meeting with BJP president J P Nadda, home minister Amit Shah and defence minister Rajnath Singh late on Saturday, NCP was informed there's only one one minister of state (MoS) post on offer for smaller parties, barring N Chandrababu Naidu-led Telugu Desam Party and Nitish Kumar-led Janata Dal (United).In view of his seniority, NCP was expecting that Patel would be granted a plum portfolio with cabinet rank. Patel said: ""We were informed that NCP will get MoS with independent charge. I was earlier a cabinet minister in the Union government, so this would be a demotion for me. I had reservations on accepting the MoS post. We informed the BJP leadership and they told us to wait for a few days and they would take remedial measures.""Pawar, who attended Modi's swearing-in ceremony in Delhi along with state NCP president Sunil Tatkare, said, ""Patel is a senior leader and has already held the post of MoS earlier. We have made it clear that either NCP gets a cabinet berth or we wait (till it becomes available). But we shall continue to support the NDA, there's no question of us leaving the alliance.""Pawar said that during his meeting with Nadda, Singh and Shah in the presence of Patel and state NCP president Sunil Tatkare, he pointed out that currently NCP has two MPs - one each in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha - but in the months to come, its strength will increase to four, with the possibility of two additional RS members. ""Under such circumstances, I argued NCP's case for a cabinet berth. I also explained to the BJP leadership that Patel is a senior cabinet member ... Under such circumstances, if NCP is given MoS post, it would be a great injustice...not appropriate. When the BJP leadership told us that NCP will have to wait for a cabinet rank, we agreed accordingly,"" he added.In the Lok Sabha polls, NCP managed to win just one seat - Tatkare wresting the Raigad seat - of the four it contested from. Following whispers that NCP was unhappy, deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis on Sunday rushed to Tatkare's residence where Patel and Pawar were already present. ""Certain situations are to be accepted in coalition politics. The BJP leadership has taken certain decisions on the constitution of the cabinet for the partners. At his juncture, it will not be possible for us to change the formula for one ally. I am sure the NCP has understood the situation. It is not the end game, soon the cabinet will be expanded and issues raised by NCP will be answered to their satisfaction,"" he said.","The NDA leadership on Sunday rejected deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar's demand to induct NCP Rajya Sabha member Praful Patel as a cabinet minister.

"Modi 3.0 cabinet: BJP train rolls on, with berths for allies",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/modi-3-0-cabinet-bjp-train-rolls-on-with-berths-for-allies/articleshow/110854352.cms,"NEW DELHI: The latest exercise of ministry-making, like all its previous editions, had its share of surprise inclusions and exclusions, though on closer examination, some of those did not seem to be as puzzling as they initially seemed.Take the case of Jagat Prakash Nadda. Though he was sure to be suitably accommodated after the end of his extended tenure as BJP chief later this month, few had sensed his return to the cabinet on Sunday.The ""surprise"", however, did help dissipate the ""mystery"" about the exclusion of outgoing I&B minister Anurag Singh Thakur who scored his fifth consecutive victory from Hamirpur, the logic being that the tiny state of Himachal Pradesh, with four Lok Sabha seats, cannot be assigned two important cabinet berths .Ditto for JD(U)'s Sanjay Jha. Easily the most trusted of Bihar CM Nitish Kumar's lieutenants at this time, he, along with his friends in BJP, was instrumental in the rapprochement with the saffron party - an endeavour for which he was once publicly heckled. He was seen as a shoo-in. But the surprise factor wears thin in the light of the ""one cabinet, one MoS"" cap BJP insisted on in the case of TDP and JD(U). This helped Rajiv Ranjan Singh 'Lalan', who is senior in JD(U) and whose ties with Nitish remain strong despite their rollercoaster pattern.Ravishankar Prasad's failure to return to the cabinet also engaged the attention of many. In his case, there were no ready answers available. Although he was dropped midway through the last term, he would be consistently fielded by the party as spokesperson on important issues and during high-intensity skirmishes. He was also given a ticket in defiance of intense lobbying. The compulsion to take along the allies, whose support will be crucial in next year's state polls, can be the only possible explanation for the omission.Rajiv Pratap Rudy, who was also dropped midway through the last tenure, has failed to make a return despite succeeding yet against against the formidable Lalu Prasad clan in Saran - something which became a topic of discussion because, after the defeat of power minister R K Singh, as well as a few others in the neighbouring region of UP, there were not too many strong claimants from the Rajput community.George Kurian, only the second person after Ravneet Singh Bittu to have been brought in despite not being a member of either of the two Houses, looks like a wild card entry. But when seen along with the success of, and reward for, Suresh Gopi, the party's maiden winner in Kerala, the choice may not look that intriguing. Gopi's success was facilitated by significant support from the Christian community and the party could be hoping to expand the opening with Kurian.Bittu's inclusion and the retention of Hardeep Singh Puri also appears to be an extension of the PM's reachout to Sikhs and his decision not to abandon the bridge building effort despite rebuffs.Choice of Harsh Malhotra, the winner from East Delhi, came at the cost of Manoj Tiwari. The winner from North-East Delhi for the third straight time had appeared to be a certainty, considering that he was the only one from among the winners of the last time who had been retained in the Capital.Contrary to the widely held estimate, BJP's media cell head and the winner from Garhwal, Anil Baluni, who enjoys the goodwill of the leadership, also could not make it.","Few had sensed Jagat Prakash Nadda's return to the cabinet on Sunday.

The first was former Amalapuram MP Ganti Mohana Chandra Balayogi, who died in a helicopter crash in 2002.Sources said BJP believes that elevating Purandeswari to LS Speaker will also be received well by Telugu Desam Party president and Andhra Pradesh chief minister-designate N Chandrababu Naidu . Notably, Naidu’s wife and Purandeswari are sisters.As a three-time MP and current Andhra BJP chief, Purandeswari played a pivotal role in BJP’s alliance with TDP and Jana Sena in Andhra Pradesh in the 2024 election. This alliance yielded impressive results, with the NDA winning 164 out of 175 assembly seats in the state. Moreover, the alliance boasts 21 MPs in Andhra Pradesh — 16 from TDP, three from BJP, and two from Jana Sena. TDP emerged as the second-largest party in the NDA alliance, after BJP.Prior to being elected MP from Rajahmundry in the just concluded polls, Purandeswari served as MP for Bapatla and Visakhapatnam in 2004 and 2009, respectively.

Both Annamalai and Tamilisai lost as LS candidates.State general secretary of BJP OBC Morcha Tiruchi Suriyaa Siva hit back at Soundararajan for her comments earlier that “anti-social elements” were inducted into the party. “It was during the presidency of L Murugan, who was appointed on your recommendation, people with criminal backgrounds were inducted... I can produce a list of such names,” Siva said. This led to volleys from both sides. Those criticising Annamalai blamed him for BJP’s loss. Annamalai’s supporters defended him saying there was a rise in BJP’s vote share. They also slammed Tamilisai for discussing party affairs in public.The issue started when former BJP intellectual wing functionary Kalyaan Raman started attacking Annamalai. Kalyanaraman had pointed out that BJP’s vote share in 2024, after contesting 23 seats was lesser than in 2014, when the party contested only nine seats.Tamilisai also agreed to former AIADMK minister S P Velumani’s view that BJP-AIADMK front could have won upto 35 seats if the alliance had continued. This did not go down well with Annamalai’s supporters.Even as supporters of Annamalai started targeting Kalyaan Raman, Tamilisai’s interview for a Tamil media house, in which she indirectly took a dig at the BJP chief, trig gered fresh controversy.Sharing that video of Tamilisai, Suriyaa Siva alleged that her interview showed that she was not able to tolerate the growth of ‘an individual’ in the state.“When you were the president, there were none to join BJP in Tamil Nadu,” he charged.Kalyaan Raman came to the defense of Tamilisai in yet another social media post. “Do you know anything about her contribution to TN BJP,” he asked a right wing functionary who criticised her.While the national high command was occupied with the swearing-in ceremony, other senior leaders in TN BJP chose to maintain silence over the rift.BJP spokesperson A N S Prasad defended supporters of Annamalai saying that controversy was created on purpose to defame the party. “ Kalyaan Raman is no longer part of the party and there is no truth in his words. Annamalai worked hard for the party’s growth in Tamil Nadu. Because of his hard work, today, BJP is a formidable political force in the state,” said Prasad.",The rift between K Annamalai and Tamilisai Soundararajan widened Sunday with their supporters indulging in social-media mudslinging in the wake of the party's poll debacle in the state. The issue started when former BJP intellectual wing functionary Kalyaan Raman started attacking AnnamAlai.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110860010,imgsize-49202,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/110860010.jpg"

Sources said the opposition in unison felt that the PM had indulged in ""hate speech and lies"" during the election campaign and had besmirched the dignity of the high office of the PM. Most of them felt ""he had lost the moral right to occupy the PM's office"", and were of the view that they keep away from the oath to convey their disagreement with the PM's conduct.

""The opposition believes the govt lacks legitimacy and PM Modi has suffered a moral defeat. It was decided that Kharge should attend the event, as he occupies a constitutional post of leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha. Else, the INDIA bloc has boycotted the event,"" a Congress functionary said. Others, like TMC chief Mamata Banerjee, had announced in advance that her party would not be attending the event.

BJP: UP Elections Analysis: How BJP Lost Ground from Phase 1 and INDIA Bloc Emerged Strong,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/analysis-of-bjps-performance-in-different-phases-of-up-elections/articleshow/110779804.cms,"Top Picks For You Lok Sabha election results: In 72 UP seats, BJP got less votes in 2024 than in 2019

LUCKNOW: INDIA bloc emerged a gainer in UP right from the first phase. BSP was the loser in all phases while BJP managed to match its 2019 performance only in the second phase. The factors that made INDIA gain and BJP lose were common in every phase , unrest against candidates and local issues could have added to the resentment among voters against the ruling party in some seats.Phase 1BJP could win just one seat in the season opener -- Pilibhit. SP bagged maximum (4 of the 8 seats), Congress and RLD one each while Azad Samaz Party chief Chandrashekhar Azad won the Nagina seat. This phase had seats with high Muslim concentration and significant Dalit numbers. BSP was the biggest loser in this phase, as it lost all three seats from 2019. The reserved seat of Nagina, which has more than 20% Dalits, was won by Mayawati’s bete noire Azad while Saharanpur went to Congress’s Imran Masood, who was also with BSP till Mayawati expelled him last year. Bijnor, the third seat that BSP won in 2019, went to RLD, a BJP-ally. BJP, on the other hand, could retain only Pilibhit, having lost Kairana and Muzaffarnagar to SP. It was the consolidation of Muslim votes in favour of the INDIA bloc and Jatavs also shifting towards Congress that went in favour of the alliance. The articulate fielding of candidates by alliance in the seats and strong anti-incumbency against sitting BJP MPs in the seats also helped the opposition gain.Phase 2This phase was more about BSP’s loss. It could not retain Amroha, the fourth seat in west UP that it had won in 2019. BSP had expelled its sitting MP in Amroha, Danish Ali, last year for his proximity with Congress. He contested the seat as Congress candidate this time. Though he did not win, Ali drew more Muslim votes than BSP’s Mujahid Hussain. RLD, which did not win any seat in 2019, was a gainer this time as it won Baghpat. BJP swept the remaining seats. This phase was in favour of BJP because of the demography of the constituencies that went to the polls in the phase. Ghaziabad is a BJP stronghold and was won by Atul Garg despite resentment over VK Singh’s replacement as the candidate in the seat. The constituency has around 28 lakh voters, still the margin of win got reduced. Baghpat was a comfortable win for RLD due to consolidation of Jats.Phase 3SP got its tally increased from two to six in this phase, while BJP tally was reduced to half — from eight in 2019 to four in 2024. The four seats (Etah, Badaun, Firozabad and Aonla) BJP lost were won by SP. Firozabad and Badaun are the strongholds of Yadav clan. BJP lost Etah and Aonla because of strong anti-incumbency against Rajvir Singh aka Raju Bhaiyya (son of late Kalyan Singh) and Dharmendra Kashyap, respectively. In Bareilly, where BJP had replaced veteran Santosh Singh Gangwar with Chhatrapal Gangwar, the party won.Phase 4In this phase again, the INDIA bloc gained. Both SP and Congress did not win any seats in 2019 but in 2024, SP got four and Congress one. BJP came down to eight in 2024 from winning all 13 seats in 2019. It lost Sitapur to Congress and Kheri, Dhaurahra, Kannauj and Etawah (reserved seat) to SP. By fourth phase, INDIA bloc had already become active and SP chief Akhilesh Yadav’s candidature from Kannauj, which was announced quite late, had galvanized the party’s poll machinery in the state. Anti-incumbency against BJP MPs was far more clear now.Phase 5SP was the biggest gainer in the phase. It won Mohanlalganj (SC), Jalaun (SC), Hamirpur, Banda, Fatehpur, Kaushambi (SC) and Faizabad while it won none in 2019. Congress, too, increased its tally from one in 2019 to three in 2024. BJP won only Lucknow, Jhansi, Gonda and Kaiserganj. In 2019, BJP had lost only Rae Bareli and won all. It came down from 13 in 2019 to four in 2024. SP gained seven seats from zero in 2019. This phase had maximum reserved seats going to polls. In Kaushambi, Vinod Sonkar lost after a strong Rajput leader from Kunda, Raghuraj Pratap Singh aka Raja Bhaiya, decided to stay neutral in the elections. Among the major losses was also Faizabad where Lallu Singh lost to SP veteran Awadhesh Prasad. Among other major losses in this phase were Amethi, where Smriti Irani lost to Gandhi family loyalist KL Sharma.Phase 6SP got a maximum of 10 seats in phase 6. It won a single seat in 2019. BSP lost all four while Congress gained one, from zero in 2019. BJP suffered loss of six seats, coming down to three from nine. The four seats BSP won in 2019, Ambedkarnagar, Shravasti, Lalganj (SC) and Jaunpur went to SP. Anti-incumbency against BJP MPs and Akhilesh Yadav’s smart choice of candidates with focus on non-Yadav OBCs affected the results in the phase. Eight-time MP Maneka Gandhi from Sultanpur, Sangam Lal Gupta from Pratapgarh, Ritesh Pandey from Ambedkarnagar, Saket Misra (son of Ram temple construction committee chairman Nripendra Misra) from Shravasti, Harish Dwivedi from Basti, Praveen Nishad from Sant Kabir Nagar, Neelam Sonkar from Lalganj, Kripa Shanker Singh from Jaunpur, Dinesh Lal Yadav Nirahua from Azamgarh and BP Saroj from Machhlishahr lost. BJP also lost Allahabad to Congress candidate Ujjwal Raman Singh.Phase 7SP was the gainer again, from zero seats in 2019 to six in 2024, in this phase. BJP lost three from 2019, and won only six. BSP lost two it won in 2019, Ghosi and Ghazipur. AD(S) was confined to only Mirzapur after losing Robertsganj (SC) to SP. PM Modi’s margin came down from 3.8 lakh in 2019 to 1.6 lakh in 2024. The phase also saw upper caste and backward votes split, because of which SP won Ghosi, as upper caste voters preferred SP’s Rajeev Rai over BJP-ally SBSP’s Arvind Rajbhar. In Chandauli, Union minister Mahendra Nath Pandey faced defeat. BSP lost Ghazipur, where SP Afzal Ansari was contesting after the death of his brother and mafia-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari, though it won Gorakhpur, Maharajganj, Bansgaon, Deoria and Kushinagar, the five seats considered part of CM Yogi Adityanath's home turf.","BJP could win just one seat in the season opener -- Pilibhit.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to take oath his third successive term on June 8.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) secured victory in the recent Lok Sabha elections, clinching 240 seats. However, this figure falls significantly short of the impressive 303 seats the party had won in the 2019 elections, meaning it has been unable to convert its vote share into seats this time.Several factors contributed to the loss of over 60 seats. The Samajwadi Party, led by Akhilesh Yadav, made substantial gains in Uttar Pradesh, a crucial state that had played a pivotal role in the Prime Minister's two previous victories. The Samajwadi Party emerged as the star performer of the Congress-led alliance, delivering its best-ever Lok Sabha performance. The BJP's seat count in the state fell from 64 in 2019 to 33, while the NDA's tally dropped to 34.In Maharashtra, the effective collaboration among Congress, Uddhav Thackeray, and Sharad Pawar resulted in a setback for the ruling party's performance.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister-designate Narendra Modi is set to reinforce a message of continuity as he inducts key figures from his outgoing administration into his new council of ministers , which will be sworn in on Sunday evening.Notable ministers from the previous government such as Amit Shah (Home), Rajnath Singh (Defence), Nirmala Sitharaman (Finance), and S. Jaishankar (External affairs) are expected to retain their roles. Senior members including Piyush Goyal, Dharmendra Pradhan, Ashwini Vaishnaw, and Hardeep Singh Puri will also continue in the new government.The new cabinet is likely to feature over 65 ministers , as suggested by visuals from a recent meeting Modi held with his prospective ministers.However, there are some notable exclusions. Anurag Thakur, the outgoing information and broadcasting minister who secured his seat in Himachal Pradesh’s Hamirpur constituency, was not present at the pre-swearing-in meeting with Modi, indicating his potential omission from the new cabinet. Similarly, Smriti Irani, who faced a significant defeat in Amethi, and Parshottam Rupala, who despite winning his seat had stirred controversy during the campaign, are also likely to be absent from the new lineup. Rajeev Chandrasekhar, who lost to Shashi Tharoor, is another likely exclusion.The new faces in Modi's cabinet are primarily from BJP allies , signifying a broad coalition effort. Leaders such as Manohar Lal Khattar, C R Paatil, Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Bandi Sanjay Kumar, and Ravneet Singh Bittu are among the fresh additions from the BJP. Allies from parties like the TDP, JD(U), Shiv Sena, and other NDA members will also be represented, including names like Ram Mohan Naidu, Lalan Singh, Prataprao Jadhav, Chirag Paswan, Jitan Ram Manjhi, and H D Kumaraswamy.Many outgoing ministers will continue in their roles, including Jyotiraditya Scindia, Bhupender Yadav, Pralhad Joshi, Giriraj Singh, and others. New additions from the BJP such as Jitin Prasada from Uttar Pradesh and Raksha Khadse from Maharashtra have also been confirmed.Speculation surrounds the future role of BJP National President J P Nadda, whose extended tenure concludes this month. Nadda, present at the meeting, might return to a government role, although he might have attended in his capacity as party head.In efforts to bolster BJP's presence in Punjab, Ravneet Singh Bittu, despite losing his Lok Sabha seat, is likely to be inducted due to his significant political profile. Other expected additions include BJP MPs Sanjay Seth from Ranchi and Jual Oram from Odisha, the latter being a former Union minister.The swearing-in ceremony on Sunday evening will mark the formal commencement of Modi’s new term, with a cabinet that blends experience with strategic new faces to address India's pressing challenges and opportunities.","Prime Minister-designate Narendra Modi is set to reinforce a message of continuity as he inducts key figures from his outgoing administration into his new council of ministers.

Hours before Narendra Modi was sworn in as PM on Sunday, the third Modi-led NDA govt allocated two ministers of state berths to Bengal. While Bongaon MP Shantanu Thakur was already an MoS, Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar has been given a spot. The earlier NDA govt had three MoS from the state.Majumdar’s appointment, however, will vacate the post of BJP’s Bengal president, according to the party’s constitution. “We have provisions in the party constitution and the party will abide by that. The position of state president will follow the same principle,” Majumdar said. It may take nearly two months to nominate a state president, BJP sources said. Majumdar had taken over as state president in 2021, replacing Dilip Ghosh .The two MPs had been invited to Modi’s residence on Sunday morning for tea. They were informed about the allocation of berths then, said sources.“I don’t have any preference for any ministry and will work with whichever portfolio is allocated to me,” Majumdar said, adding: “This is the first time Balurghat will have a minister at Centre. No other govt had thought of nominating a minister from the area before.” The Balurghat MP said that he and Thakur had an informal talk with Modi over issues in Bengal.“For me the nature of my job will change, but the hard work will continue. The PM has a dream and we will work towards realising it,” Majumdar added.Thakur, who has been serving as a minister of state for ports, shipping and waterways since 2021, said that he had never worked with ministerial berths in mind. “I don’t work with an expectation to become a minister. There has been an unprecedented amount of work in the shipping ministry in the past five years.

Italy’s Giorgia Meloni wins EU vote as far-right gains across the bloc,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/italys-giorgia-meloni-wins-eu-vote-as-far-right-gains-across-the-bloc/articleshow/110858500.cms,"Giorgia Meloni, Italy's Prime Minister, is poised to strengthen her position following a victory in the European Parliament elections, as far-right parties made gains across the European Union. According to a poll conducted by Swg and published by La7, Meloni's right-wing Brothers of Italy party was expected to emerge as the clear winner, securing between 27% and 31% of the vote, a significant increase from the mere 6% it obtained in 2019.

Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni delivers her speech during at an electoral rally.

Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is set to solidify her power after winning the vote in Italy for the European Parliament as far-right parties gained across the union.

Meloni’s right-wing Brothers of Italy party was on course to be the winner, according to a poll by Swg, published by La7, with the party expected to gain 27% to 31% compared to just over 6% in 2019.

According to the poll, the immediate runner-up was the left-wing Democratic Party, getting 21.5% to 25.5% of the vote, highlighting polarization between Italy’s two main political parties.

Matteo Salvini’s League and Antonio Tajani’s Forza Italia, founded by the late Silvio Berlusconi, both coalition partners in Meloni’s government, were projected to gain just under 10%.

Meloni’s projected victory is part of a slew of positive results for right-wing parties in Europe, led by France and Germany. Her position will be key in deciding vital alliances in the European Parliament — and selecting the successor to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who is running to retain her job.

Sunday night’s victory for Meloni is a significant vote of mid-term confidence from Italians, who rocketed her party to first place in the 2022 election with 26% of votes. In a bid to get more votes and have Italians rally around her persona, Meloni decided to top her party’s lists in the election even if she has no intention of leaving her job in Rome, telling them to simply vote for “Giorgia.”

","Right-wing party expected to win 27% of the vote, up from just 6% in 2013. Left- wing Democratic Party expected to get 21.5% of vote, down from 22% in 2012.

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan , currently jailed, invoked the case of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal receiving bail ahead of Lok Sabha elections as he protested his mistreatment in jail before the Supreme Court of Pakistan.Appearing on Thursday before a five-member bench led by Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa, Khan decried the ""victimisation"" he has faced since being ousted from power in April 2022.The bench, which included Justices Aminuddin Khan, Jamal Khan Mandokhel, Athar Minallah, and Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, heard Khan's grievances regarding amendments to the National Accountability Ordinance (NAO). Justice Minallah expressed sympathy, acknowledging the misfortune of Khan being in jail despite leading a major political party with millions of supporters, as per reports.Khan, 71, argued that his conviction within five days was a deliberate attempt to sideline him from the general elections held on February 8. He contrasted his situation with that of Kejriwal, who was granted bail by India's Supreme Court, enabling him to campaign. Khan contended that Pakistan is operating under an undeclared ""martial law,"" further oppressing his political activities.Expressing disappointment over the Supreme Court's rejection of a request from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's government for live streaming the case, Khan questioned the judgment's implication that he was engaging in political point-scoring. Chief Justice Isa responded that a judge need not explain their verdicts, advising Khan to file a review petition instead.Khan urged the Supreme Court to appoint a chairman for the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), criticizing the current appointment process as being influenced by a ""third umpire"" when consensus between the Opposition and government fails. Justice Minallah countered, stating there was no justification to invalidate the NAB amendments.The PTI founder called for reforms in NAB, citing ongoing inquiries against him. Justice Minallah's reminder about the Chief Election Commissioner appointment led Khan to argue that restoring the amendment would benefit his NAB cases but potentially bankrupt the country.Chief Justice Isa prohibited Khan from referencing the Islamabad High Court (IHC) verdict in the cipher cases, as appeals might be pending in the Supreme Court. Justice Rizvi questioned Khan's failure to oppose the NAB amendments in Parliament, to which Khan replied that his government was overthrown through a conspiracy, making it futile to engage with the current ""conspiratorial government.""Khan also sought a comparison of his jail conditions with those afforded to former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. In response, Justice Mandokhel humorously noted that Sharif is not currently in jail, asking if Khan wished for his incarceration. Chief Justice Isa concluded the session by mentioning the possibility of a surprise visit by a judicial officer to inspect Khan's jail conditions.",Imran Khan appeared before the Supreme Court of Pakistan on Thursday. The former Pakistan Prime Minister is currently jailed for contempt of court. Khan argued that his conviction within five days was a deliberate attempt to sideline him from the general elections held on February 8. The bench heard Khan's grievances regarding amendments to the National Accountability Ordinance.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110799336,imgsize-1004244,width-400,resizemode-4/110799336.jpg"

Labour pledges fresh inquiry into Thatcher's role in 1984 Operation Blue Star,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/labour-pledges-fresh-inquiry-into-thatchers-role-in-1984-operation-blue-star/articleshow/110776077.cms,"LONDON: The Labour party , which is forecast to win the July 4 UK general election, has pledged to hold an inquiry to investigate the role Britain played in storming the Golden Temple in June 1984 to remove Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and other Sikh militants, which triggered the assassination of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and the anti-Sikh riots.

Deputy Labour leader Angela Raynor said, “As we mark the 40th anniversary of the raid on the Golden Temple, Labour stands with the Sikh community in calling for an inquiry into the historic role Britain played. A Labour govt will work to determine the best way to find out the truth.”

Labour candidate for Coventry South Zarah Sultana said: “The role Thatcher’s govt played in this has been shrouded in secrecy. I stand with the Sikh community in calling for an inquiry to reveal the truth.” Labour candidate for Slough Tan Dhesi wrote on X: “40 years since Indira Gandhi ordered attack on Golden Temple complex…Still no justice for victims, nor UK inquiry (but Labour have promised) into Thatcher govt involvement!”

There has been no independent public inquiry into Margaret Thatcher’s involvement in Operation Blue Star , despite the release of classified documents in Jan 2014 implicating the UK govt.

Those files revealed that Britain had sent an SAS officer to India in Feb, ahead of Operation Blue Star, to draw up a plan to “remove Sikh extremists from the Golden temple”, having been asked to do so by Indira Gandhi.

The Heywood Review, commissioned by former PM David Cameron and published in Feb 2014, found no record of any UK assistance to the June 1984 operation other than the “limited military advice provided in mid-February”. The review, based on over 23,000 documents, said: “The recommendation and decision to agree this request were based on advice from the British high commission that it would be good for the bilateral relationship, whereas refusal would not be understood by Mrs Gandhi. There were significant differences between the actual June operation, and the advice from the UK military officer in Feb. The actual operation implemented by the Indian Army differed significantly from the approach suggested by the UK military officer.”

Many British Sikhs believe the Heywood Review is a whitewash and are calling for an independent judge-led public inquiry.
