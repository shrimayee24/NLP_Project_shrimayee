BJP slams West Bengal CM

NEW DELHI: Union minister of women and child development Annapurna Devi on Friday responded to West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee 's second letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying that information contained in her letter is ""factually incorrect"" and suggested that it aims to ""cover up delays"" in the operationalization of Fast Track Special Courts (FTSCs) in the state.The letter came after Mamata Banerjee wrote to the Prime Minister for the second time, expressing frustration over the lack of a direct response to her initial plea for stricter central legislation on rape cases. In her letter Banerjee criticised the Union Minister’s earlier reply as inadequate and generic.""As may be seen, the information contained in your letter in this regard is factually incorrect and appears to be a step in the direction to cover up the delays in operationalizing the FTSCs by the State,"" the Union minister said in her letter.Annapurna Devi also slammed the West Bengal government for not operationalizing 11 additional FTSCs despite the pendency of 48,600 rape and POCSO cases in the state.""In the FTCs in West Bengal, a total of 81,141 cases were pending as on 30.06.2024,"" the letter read.""Inspite of pendency of 48,600 rape and POCSO cases in West Bengal, the State has not operationalized additional 11 FTSCs which may be exclusive POCSO Courts or combined FTSCs dealing with both Rape and POCSO cases, as per the State's requirement,"" the letter added.In her letter, she said that stringent laws already exist under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), which prescribes severe punishments, including life imprisonment and the death penalty, for such crimes.Mamata Banerjee's second letter to Prime Minister Modi, dated August 29, 2024, was a follow-up to her initial letter sent on August 22, 2024. In her initial letter, Banerjee had expressed deep concern over the rising incidents of rape and called for more stringent central legislation to address these crimes. She stressed the need for exemplary punishment for perpetrators to act as a deterrent and urged the Prime Minister to take immediate action.In her second letter, Mamata Banerjee expressed disappointment over the lack of a direct response from the Prime Minister to her first letter, which she deemed critical in light of the ongoing situation in West Bengal. She acknowledged receiving a reply from the Union Minister of Women and Child Development, Annapurna Devi, but criticized the response for not adequately addressing the gravity of the issue. Banerjee emphasized that the seriousness of the subject and its relevance to society had not been fully appreciated in the minister's reply.""You may kindly recall my letter No.44-CM dated August 22, 2024, regarding the need for stringent Central legislation on incidents of rape and meting out exemplary punishment to perpetrators of such crimes. No reply was received from your end on such a sensitive issue,"" Mamata Banerjee wrote in her letter to PM Modi.The BJP strongly criticized Mamata Banerjee's approach, with party leaders accusing her of attempting to mislead the public. BJP leader Amit Malviya took to social media, calling Mamata Banerjee a ""liar"" and accusing her government of failing to implement the stringent rules already in place for the protection of women and children. The BJP also urged the West Bengal government to act with honesty and integrity in handling such sensitive issues.On August 9, the brutal rape and murder of a trainee doctor at Kolkata's RG Kar hospital led to a political storm in West Bengal. The incident sparked widespread outrage, with protests erupting across the state.

The assembly resumes its proceedings in the post-lunch session.Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma wrote on X that the rule of adjourning the House every Friday ""for Jumme"" has been abolished ""in order to increase the productivity of the Assam legislative assembly and to remove the colonial burden from the state"".""This practice was started by Syed Saadullah of the Muslim League in 1937,"" he wrote as he thanked Daimary and legislators ""for this effort to maintain the ancient secular values of India"".The proposal to remove this rule from the Rules of Procedure of the assembly was placed before the rules committee headed by the speaker, which unanimously agreed to drop the rule.An official statement said that on all other days, the House used to conduct its proceedings ""without any such adjournment for religious purposes"", which was taken note of by speaker Daimary. ""In view of the secular nature of the Constitution, he proposed that the Assam legislative assembly must conduct its proceedings on Fridays like any other day without any adjournment to facilitate Muslim members to go for namaz,"" the statement added.""Accordingly, today, the House adopted a motion to amend this rule so as to provide for sitting of the House for conduct of its proceedings on Fridays like any other day. So, today history has been created by doing away with this colonial practice which was aimed at dividing the society on religious basis.""","Assam legislative assembly Friday ended a long-established custom of adjourning House sessions at forenoon on Fridays to allow Muslim members to offer namaz prayers.

'Rahul Gandhi's politics has changed': Smriti Irani dissects his new 'white T-shirt strategy',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rahul-gandhis-politics-has-changed-smriti-irani-dissects-his-new-white-t-shirt-strategy/articleshow/112894719.cms,"NEW DELHI: BJP leader Smriti Irani pointed out a noticeable shift in Congress leader Rahul Gandhi 's political strategy. Dissecting the evolution of Rahul's approach, Irani suggested that his newfound focus on caste politics and symbolic gestures marks a significant departure from his earlier tactics.In a recent podcast, Smriti Irani said, ""There has been a change in Rahul Gandhi's politics."" Highlighting that the Congress leader appears to believe he has finally tasted success after years of struggling to find his footing, she said, “When he (Rahul Gandhi) speaks about caste, he for the first time in his political career, speaks as an instrument.When he wears white T-shirt in Parliament, he knows what message he is trying to send to the youth.”She also noted that every gesture and statement from Gandhi is part of a broader, more calculated strategy. ""They're planning a different game in politics now, and these guys are far from naive,"" she added.Irani highlighted that Rahul's recent emphasis on caste politics is a deliberate move, a first in his career where he is using such a sensitive issue to resonate with the masses.Rahul's shift towards caste-based rhetoric is a response to his earlier failures in garnering mass appeal through other means. ""Rahul Gandhi couldn't gain traction by visiting temples, it was being ridiculed. Many people thought that it was deception,"" she said.Irani argues that this led him to pivot towards caste as a new strategy to gain political momentum. “He then thought if this isn't helping him gain traction. What else could work, caste could. So this is a part of his political strategy. If he had a political mindset, we would have seen it reflected in his political journey already”, Irani said.In the Lok Sabha election 2019, Irani emerged victorious against Rahul Gandhi, securing a lead of 55,120 votes. However, in the 2024 election, Congress candidate Kishori Lal Sharma managed to unseat Irani by a substantial margin of 1.67 lakh votes.","BJP leader Smriti Irani points out a noticeable shift in Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's political strategy.

KTR on X addressing Kharge, said tagging his recent post on demolitions in BJP ruled states, “As you said, demolishing someone’s home and rendering their family homeless is both inhumane and unjust.This is exactly what is happening in Telangana with utter contempt for law & judiciary. In Mahbubnagar town where 75 houses of the poor have been demolished at 3 am without any notices. Out of these destitute people, 25 families are also physically disabled. Law without due process is not law. It is a modern day civilisational abomination. Please advise the Congress Govt in Telangana to not become yet another Bulldozer Raj in the country.”Kharge on August 24 posted on X that ‘Demolishing someone's home and rendering their family homeless is both inhumane and unjust. The repeated targeting of minorities in BJP-ruled states is deeply troubling. Such actions have no place in a society governed by the Rule of Law. The Congress Party strongly condemns the BJP state governments for their blatant disregard of the Constitution, using bulldozing as a tactic to instill fear among citizens. Anarchy cannot replace natural justice—offences must be adjudicated in courts, not through state-sponsored coercion.”The BRS leader also posted the demolition drive video in Mahbubnagar.",BRS working president KT Rama Rao asked AICC president Mallikarjun Kharge to advise the Congress govt in Telangana to not become yet another bulldozer raj in the country.
