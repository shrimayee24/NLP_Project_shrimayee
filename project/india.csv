"Ahead of civic polls, Telangana cabinet clears 42% quota",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ahead-of-civic-polls-telangana-cabinet-clears-42-quota/articleshow/122377126.cms,"HYDERABAD: A cabinet meeting of the A Revanth Reddy-led Congress govt in Telangana approved Thursday a proposal to grant 42% reservation to Backward Classes (BCs) in local bodies - just in time for panchayat elections within three months, as mandated by a June 25 high court directive. The quota will be implemented through an ordinance.The reservation percentage is based on empirical data from the caste survey conducted by the state govt and submitted to the BC Commission headed by Busani Venkateshwara Rao. Based on Supreme Court's verdict permitting sub-classification of groups entitled to reservation, the cabinet had approved amendments to the Panchayat Raj Act, 2018, as precursor to raising the quota for Backwards Classes.With governor Jishnu Dev Varma proroguing the assembly and legislative council sessions on Thursday, the state govt now has the constitutional window to issue the relevant ordinance.The cabinet made the decision after consulting legal experts and the advocate general, who was present at the meeting, sources said. Revenue minister Ponguleti Srinivas Reddy & BC welfare minister Ponnam Prabhakar said an ordinance was key to avoid delays & legal complications.""Per Rahul Gandhi's promise, Congress conducted a caste survey after coming to power. Two bills providing 42% reservation for BCs in education, employment, and local bodies were passed in the assembly and sent to the governor. But the Centre has been raising queries, stalling constitutional amendments needed for quota implementation. This ordinance reflects our firm commitment to BC political upliftment,"" Srinivas Reddy said.Ponnam said panchayat elections would be held by Sept 30, the deadline set by HC. ""We stand by our BC declaration made in Kamareddy. We urge all parties to support this reservation for the smooth conduct of panchayat elections,"" he said.On concerns over SC's 50% cap on total reservations, Ponnam argued that it had already been breached through the Centre's EWS quota, while Tamil Nadu currently has over 60% reservation. He said BCs constitute 56% of Telangana's population, which justifies 42% reservation for them.","The quota will be implemented through an ordinance.

Delhi Judge Cash Row: Modi Govt Likely To Move Impeachment Motion Against Justice Varma

NEW DELHI: With government indicating that it will set up a statutory inquiry committee as part of impeachment proceedings of Justice Yashwant Varma contrary to its earlier stance, Congress is likely to support the move to sack the judge on corruption charges, even as it plans to use the platform to ""embarrass"" BJP for ignoring similar proceedings against another judge Shekhar Yadav over ""hate speech"".The push in Congress is to use impeachment proceedings to hammer at government's ""selective approach"" against judges. In a rare occurrence, twin impeachment proceedings are hanging fire simultaneously - Varma is facing the charge of corruption after the alleged recovery and burning of cash at his residence, while Allahabad high court judge Shekhar Yadav is in the firing line for his controversial comments about Uniform Civil Code.Interestingly, while central government has announced its intent to bring an impeachment motion against Varma, opposition last Dec filed an impeachment notice against Yadav for ""hate speech"" but govt has maintained silence on it.Senior lawyer and Congress MP Abhishek Singhvi said, ""There should be no double standards in the way govt seeks to approach Varma and Yadav cases. Selectivity and opportunism between the two cases is not good.Both deserve initiation of impeachment process. In Yadav case, govt has already dragged its feet long enough.""Congress sources said the party is expected to support impeachment of Varma in monsoon session of Parliament. Congress functionaries like Singhvi and Vivek Tankha had earlier targeted govt for planning to do away with the inquiry panel provided for in Judges Inquiry Act, and warned that the ""violation"" will lay grounds for Varma's discharge later.Now, sources said, government has since conveyed that it will set up an inquiry committee on Varma.However, a big issue for opposition is ""hate speech"" by Justice Yadav, for which its impeachment notice is pending. Modi govt has not given any indication on taking it up, despite public calls for it by Congress functionaries, and a letter by lawyer-MP Vivek Tankha to Rajya Sabha chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar.A senior Congress functionary said, ""We are not linking the two issues of impeachment. We will support the move to sack Varma, but we will use the platform to embarrass govt on its selective approach on accountability in the judiciary.""","Congress is likely to support the move to sack the judge on corruption charges.

NEW DELHI: Delhi high court stayed Thursday the release of 'Udaipur Files' in a rare instance of judicial intervention to pause a movie on the eve of its pan-India opening, reports Abhinav Garg. The film is purportedly based on tailor Kanhaiya Lal's 2022 murder in Udaipur.The court directed Islamic cleric body Jamiat Ulema-i-Hind and other petitioners, which have objected to the movie, to seek a review of its censor certificate. The division bench of Chief Justice D K Upadhyaya and Justice Anish Dayal directed the petitioners to approach the Centre within two days with their grievance. Until the Centre takes a call on their revision plea, the film will not be released, the bench said.Kanhaiya Lal was murdered in June 2022 for allegedly sharing a social media post in support of former BJP functionary Nupur Sharma after her controversial comments on Prophet Mohammed.NIA arrested alleged assassins Mohammad Riyaz and Mohammad Ghous. Their trial is pending. The judges pointed “that it is not impermissible for this court to exercise extraordinary jurisdiction even in a case where a petitioner has not exhausted its alternative statutory remedies”.“But having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case… especially the processes to be gone into at the time of grant of certification, we are of the opinion that the petitioner ought to approach the central govt by invoking Section 6 of the (Cinematograph) Act (which deals with revisional powers vested with the central govt),” the high court said.During the hearing, petitioners’ senior counsel Kapil Sibal described the film as “the worst form of hate speech” against a community and an “imminent threat to public order and harmony”. He told the bench he had watched the film in a private screening, as directed by the court. He cited some instances and dialogues to argue the movie was “not art but cinematic vandalism” to vilify a community. Among the scenes Sibal highlighted was one showing arrests of Muslim students.In contrast, additional solicitor general Chetan Sharma, representing the Centre, justified the censor board’s nod and contended that it was a movie based on a crime, not any community. “The film cautions people. It is a crime-specific film. We should all live together — that’s the theme,” Chetan Sharma argued.",Delhi high court stays release of 'Udaipur Files' in a rare instance of judicial intervention to pause a movie on the eve of its pan-India opening.

Generations have changed, but not the mindset"".Trivedi also criticised Congress functionaries for targeting senior MP Shashi Tharoor who, in an opinion piece, called the 1975 Emergency a ""dark chapter in Indian democracy"" and noted that voters had responded to its excesses by voting Indira Gandhi out of power.In response, Congress MP Manickam Tagore took a swipe at Tharoor, posting on X: ""When a colleague starts repeating BJP lines word for word, you begin to wonder - is the bird becoming a parrot?

"SC to EC: Consider Aadhaar, voter ID & ration card for SIR in Bihar",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-to-ec-consider-aadhaar-voter-id-ration-card-for-sir/articleshow/122373490.cms,"New Delhi: Supreme Court on Thursday asked the Election Commission to consider accepting Aadhaar , voter ID card and ration card as valid documents for its special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar and allowed the process to go on. Though the court flagged the practical difficulty in completing the task within the short timeline as it was tied to the state polls, EC assured 60% of the work was already done.Noting that EC itself accepted that the list of 11 approved documents was not an exhaustive one, a bench of justices Sudhanshu Dhulia and Joymalya Bagchi said it was prima facie of the view that the commission should also consider Aadhaar and the other two documents. It said Aadhaar was already considered a relevant identity document for electoral rolls.The court, however, twice clarified that it was not a direction but a suggestion to the EC which could be discarded but for which the panel has to give reasons.Initially, the court was in favour of restraining EC from publishing draft rolls which is scheduled for August 1 but it refrained from doing so after the commission strongly opposed it.Thereafter, the court posted the hearing for July 28 to take stock of the situation before publication of draft rolls.The bench said in its order it was Priima facie of the opinion that there were three questions which needed to be examined in the case — power of EC to conduct the process; the procedure to exercise the power; and the timeline which was very short as Bihar elections are due in November.The court witnessed two-and-ahalf hours of intense arguments with senior advocates Gopal Sankaranarayanan, Kapil Sibal, A M Singhvi and Shadan Farasat challenging the validity of EC’s decision. The high-stakes legal duel saw the poll panel fielding senior advocates Rakesh Dwivedi and Maninder Singh along with former attorney general K K Venugopal to justify the decision.During the hearing, SC said while EC was discharging its constitutional duty and it was not doubting the commission’s effort and sincerity, there was an issue of perception and practical difficulties which had to be examined. It questioned why the process started so late and why it was linked with the Bihar assembly election which is to take place in November. Dwivedi said being a constitutional body like judiciary, the EC could not answer about perception but only on law and there was no illegality.“If you ask me, then I would not be able to furnish those documents. You are talking about law but I am talking about practicality,” Justice Dhulia said. Dwivedi further said EC could not and does not intend to remove people from the list and a wrong perception was being created against the exercise because of a premeditated mindset.But the bench asked why EC took the decision suddenly and why it was related to the Nov election. “We appreciate the exercise done by you. Nobody disputes that. But with such a big population, is it possible to link the exercise to the ensuing election... We have serious doubts whether you will meet the timeline. It is not practical,” the bench said.Trying to dispel the court’s doubt, Dwivedi said the exercise was going on in full swing, and 60% of the work was already done. He said political parties were also helping in the exercise. He successfully prodded the court not to pass any interim order and to list the case days before publication of draft rolls to take stock of the situation.The court issued notice to EC on the batch of petitions filed by opposition parties — Congress, NCP (SP), CPI, CPM, CPI (ML), DMK, Samajwadi Party, Shiv Sena (UBT), JMM, RJD and TMC. In addition, Yogendra Yadav, NGOs Association for Democratic Reforms and People’s Union for Civil Liberties, and a few residents of Bihar have also filed petitions against the poll panel’s decision.","The Supreme Court asked the Election Commission to consider accepting Aadhaar, voter ID card and ration card as valid documents for its special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar.
