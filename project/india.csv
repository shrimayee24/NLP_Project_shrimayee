'Institutional Murder' Rahul Blames BJP Govt for “Shielding Criminals” in Maha Doctor’s Suicide case

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Sunday launched a sharp attack on the Maharashtra government, claiming that law and order in the state has “collapsed” following the alleged rape and suicide of a woman doctor in Satara. The grand old party also accused the state’s home department of being “bankrupt.”Congress leader Vijay Wadettiwar said, “The Home Department of Maharashtra is bankrupt. The law and order situation has completely collapsed... Ordinary people don't even have the courage to go to the police station... The police have become vagrants, resorting to hooliganism...”Deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde, meanwhile, condemned the incident and assured that the accused would face strict action. “The accused have been arrested. The incident is condemnable and unfortunate. In this case, none of the accused will be let go, there will be very harsh punishment, and the whole matter will go to the fast-track court,” Shinde said.Maharashtra minister Pankaja Gopinath Munde also met the victim’s family in Phaltan and expressed support and solidarity, assuring them of justice.Earlier, Satara Police arrested two individuals -- Police Sub-Inspector Gopal Badne and Prashant Bankar — in connection with the case.The two have been booked under charges of rape and abetment to suicide. PSI Badne, who was named in the suicide note, has been suspended, officials confirmed.Authorities said the woman doctor died by suicide on Friday, leaving behind a message written on her hand that mentioned a police officer and two others.The victim’s cousin alleged that she had been facing sustained political and police pressure related to her professional duties. “There was a lot of police and political pressure on her to make wrong mortem reports. She tried to complain about it. My sister should get justice,” the cousin told ANI.“She was under a lot of political and police pressure for the last year. Medical staff at the hospital are also involved. Everyone forced her to make wrong postmortem reports and forge fitness certificates. She was being forced to perform more and more postmortems despite other officers being present at the hospital,” the cousin added.The family suspects that another suicide note may exist, suggesting that the doctor had been documenting her complaints and distress in writing. Another relative demanded exemplary punishment, saying, “The accused should get the strictest of punishment.”The Federation of All India Medical Association (FAIMA) has condemned the death of doctor and called for an immediate and transparent investigation into the case.","Congress leader Vijay Wadettiwar said, “The Home Department of Maharashtra is bankrupt.
