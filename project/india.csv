“Democracy Sliding Into ICU”: Opposition Targets BJP As BMC Polls Trigger Political Storm

(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Tuesday warned of potential damage to its alliance with Maharashtra ally Shiv Sena (UBT), after the Uddhav Thackeray-led party, along with others, teamed up with the BJP, resulting in the election of the saffron party’s candidate as mayor of Chandrapur Municipal Corporation.The development was a major setback for the Congress, which was poised to win the mayor’s post but lost by just one vote.BJP corporator Sangeeta Khandekar was elected mayor, while Shiv Sena (UBT)’s Prashant Danav became deputy mayor.Maharashtra Congress chief Harshwardhan Sapkal alleged “horse-trading” and blamed Shiv Sena (UBT), Asaduddin Owaisi’s AIMIM, and Prakash Ambedkar’s Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA).“In the Chandrapur mayoral election, the BJP secured 32 votes and Congress 31. The Sena (UBT) is an ally in the Maha Vikas Aghadi and the INDIA bloc. With its six corporators, the Sena (UBT) was expected to support the Congress. But the party chose to go with the BJP. This development will have consequences in the state,” Sapkal told reporters in Mumbai.“The BJP also gained the upper hand with the support of the AIMIM. If the VBA, with whom we had formed a genuine alliance in the civic body polls, had backed the Congress, our candidate would have won.There was horse-trading,” Sapkal added.Addressing the factional feud within the Chandrapur Congress, he said Congress corporators were “united,” and that he had personally resolved differences among party leaders in the city.“It is only because of the Shiv Sena (UBT), AIMIM, and VBA that the BJP could install its mayor,” the Maharashtra Congress chief asserted.Till Monday, alliances in the 66-member Chandrapur Municipal Corporation remained unclear following a fractured verdict in the January 15 polls.The Congress emerged as the largest party with 27 seats, while the BJP came a close second with 23, triggering a race between the two rivals to form a coalition and secure the mayor and deputy mayor posts.The Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena (UBT), a former BJP ally, won six seats, while three went to the Bharatiya Shetkari Kamgar Paksh (Janvikas Sena), two to the VBA, and one each to AIMIM, BSP, and Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Eknath Shinde’s Shiv Sena, a BJP ally. Two independents also secured wins. The poll results were declared on January 16.","Congress warns of potential damage to its alliance with Maharashtra ally Shiv Sena (UBT) The Uddhav Thackeray-led party, along with others, teamed up with the BJP, resulting in the election of the saffron party’s candidate as mayor of Chandrapur Municipal Corporation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128165693,imgsize-30478,width-400,resizemode-4/harshvardhan-sapkal.jpg"

PM Modi Declares Countdown For DMK Exit, Calls It A Government Of Corruption, Mafia, And Crime

(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Manickam Tagore has questioned why his party’s Puducherry unit should not lead the alliance with Tamil Nadu ally DMK in Puducherry, citing the Congress’ ""higher vote share"" in the poll-bound Union territory.Tagore pointed to the two parties’ performance in Puducherry’s lone Lok Sabha seat in the 2014 polls, noting that Congress’ V Narayanasamy was the runner-up with 26.35% of the votes, while DMK’s AMH Nazeem came fourth with 8.19%.“Will the party that got 8% of votes in the alliance be able to bear the leadership? Or will the party that got 26% be able to bear the leadership? Why should the Congress party in the alliance have to speak in a belittling way? This pattern continues It's not goods,” Tagore, the Virudhunagar MP, wrote on X on February 6.His reaction came shortly after DMK election in-charge for Puducherry and Lok Sabha MP S Jagathrakshakan visited the Union territory, skipping meetings with Congress leaders there.According to a source, the Congress was not included in initial talks with the DMK. Jagathrakshakan later told reporters that the final decision on alliance and seat-sharing would be made by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and DMK president and Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin.Assembly elections in Puducherry, along with Tamil Nadu, are expected in April. The Union territory is currently governed by the All India NR Congress-led NDA coalition.In the 2021 Puducherry assembly polls, the Congress contested 14 seats and won two, while the DMK contested 13 and emerged victorious in six.","Congress MP Manickam Tagore questioned why his party’s Puducherry unit should not lead the alliance with Tamil Nadu ally DMK.

No-Confidence Against Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla Explained: Process, Rules And Numbers In Parliament

NEW DELHI: On a day All India Trinamool Congress chose not to sign the opposition’s notice of a resolution for removal of Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla , its Lok Sabha MP Abhishek Banerjee said his party MPs had “no problem” signing the notice but wanted the opposition to first write to Birla with their grievances such as the suspension of eight opposition MPs and give him a chance to take corrective action.“If the Speaker does not act or fails to provide satisfactory responses, a no-confidence motion can be brought after waiting for three days following the sending of the letter. All 28 AITC MPs will sign it. If it is brought today, AITC will maintain its stand that the letter should be sent first,” said Banerjee, TMC ’s national general secretary, while speaking to media persons in Parliament complex earlier in the day.Sticking to the position the TMC MPs did not sign the notice submitted to the secretary general of Lok sabha by the opposition later in the day. However, TMC has kept its options open as far as deciding on its stand on supporting the oppostion’s motion if and when it is admitted.Asserting that the TMC believes in “Parliament, in debate, and in accountability”, Banerjee said, “My stand is we should be tolerant. Otherwise, what is the difference between us and the BJP? Instead of trying to flex our muscles, we want to give an opportunity to the Chair.”The TMC’s stand is seen to be politically strategic, meant to reinforce its distinct position within the INDIA alliance steered by the Congress.Also this gains significance as it comes ahead of polls in West Bengal where the TMC has ruled out any alliance with the Congress, with party chief and West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee making it clear that her party will fight it alone against the BJP and others.On being asked about whether TMC has any plans to bring an impeachment motion against chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar, Banerjee highlighted that his party did not plan on bringing an impeachment motion against Gyanesh Kumar at the very beginning. He said they first explored all avenues by repeatedly reaching out to the Election Commission over the ongoing Special Intensive Revision but got no response from EC. ""Impeachment is the last resort,” he asserted.Banerjee last week called for the impeachment of CEC and said she was willing to join hands with the Congress and other opposition parties to rally support on the issue.",All India Trinamool Congress chose not to sign the opposition’s notice of a resolution for removal of Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla.
