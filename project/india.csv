Poll What’s Most Important When Choosing Election Candidates? Their Integrity and Honesty Their Policies and Plans for the Future

NEW DELHI: Several prominent members of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) have resigned from their positions as Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs), citing dissatisfaction with the party's decision to not grant them tickets for the upcoming elections.The resignations include Rohit Mehraulia, MLA from Trilokpuri, Madan Lal from Kasturba Nagar, Rajesh Rishi from Janakpuri, and Bhavna Gaur from Palam. Additionally, Bhupinder Singh Joon, the MLA from Bijwasan, and Pawan Kumar Sharma, the MLA from Adarsh Nagar, Madipur MLA Girish Soni have also stepped down from their posts.The AAP has not provided tickets to these six MLAs for the next election cycle, a move that has led to their departure from the party. Sources close to the resigned members suggest that the decision to exclude them from the list of candidates was a key factor in their decision to leave.In another major development, Naresh Yadav, the MLA from Mehrauli, also resigned from the party. Yadav, who had served as an MLA for two consecutive terms, was initially fielded as the AAP candidate for a third term. However, after allegations related to a sacrilege case were proven, Yadav voluntarily returned his ticket. Subsequently, AAP decided to field another candidate for the Mehrauli constituency.The party has yet to issue an official statement regarding the resignations.","The resignations include Rohit Mehraulia, MLA from Trilokpuri, Madan Lal from Kasturba Nagar, Rajesh Rishi from Janakpuri and Bhavna Gaur from Palam.

MLAs voice discontent

AAP hits back

Internal rift or political strategy?

BJP eyes opportunity

In a blow to the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) ahead of the Delhi Assembly elections, eight outgoing MLAs resigned on Friday, accusing the party of corruption and neglect. The move comes just five days before the polls, raising questions about internal dissent within the ruling party.Among those who quit were Madan Lal (Kasturba Nagar), Bhavna Gaur (Palam), Naresh Yadav (Mehrauli), Rohit Mehraulia (Trilokpuri), Pawan Sharma (Adarsh Nagar), B S Joon (Bijwasan), Rajesh Rishi (Janakpuri) and Girish Soni (Madipur). Many of them posted their resignation letters on social media, openly criticizing AAP’s leadership.Gaur, a two-time MLA, wrote to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, stating, ""I have lost faith in you and the party."" Meanwhile, Mehraulia took aim at AAP’s ideology, claiming, ""They only need a photo of Baba Saheb, not his ideology.""AAP’s national spokesperson Reena Gupta dismissed the allegations, revealing that a party survey found these MLAs were inaccessible to the public, which led to them being denied tickets.""They were replaced due to poor feedback. Their resignations and shift to another party only prove their opportunism,"" Gupta said.AAP also defended its candidate selection, emphasizing that it has prioritized ""ordinary individuals from humble backgrounds"" in its ticket distribution.While Naresh Yadav was initially given a ticket, AAP revoked it following his conviction in a 2016 religious desecration case. His replacement by Mahender Chaudhary fueled speculation about selective candidate screening.Meanwhile, some AAP leaders criticized the defectors, with Kirari MLA Rituraj Jha accusing them of betraying the party. ""History will never forgive them,"" he said, reaffirming loyalty to Kejriwal.With AAP battling to retain power for a third consecutive term, the BJP sees a chance to break its 25-year exile from Delhi’s governance. The resignations could provide the opposition with ammunition to question Kejriwal’s leadership ahead of the February 5 polls.","Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is facing a major crisis ahead of the Delhi Assembly elections.

Election Commission keeps all options open as Arvind Kejriwal escalates water row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ec-keeps-all-options-open-as-arvind-kejriwal-escalates-water-row/articleshow/117762641.cms,"NEW DELHI: With former Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal sticking to his guns on “Haryana poisoned Yamuna waters” allegations and launching a scathing attack on the Election Commission , all options are open for the EC. This could include ordering a criminal FIR if it concludes that he has failed to back up his claims with facts and evidence by the Friday 11 am deadline set by the poll panel.The EC letter to Kejriwal on Thursday stated that his reply to its notice provided no “factual and legal matrix” with evidence to back his allegation that the BJP govt in Haryana deliberately poisoned the waters of Yamuna “with an intent to cause genocide of citizens of Delhi”. It put on record that the commission has prima facie found his allegations as “promoting disharmony and enmity between different groups, and overall public disorder and unrest, even by most sober interpretation”.EC said the words used in his statement, the comparative emphasis laid on them and the manner of expression at a delicate time during peak campaigning “prima facie pose a risk of endangering peace and harmony between states and peoples.”As Kejriwal refused to back off, his defiance raised the prospect of EC responding with measures, including the registration of an FIR, in its armoury for alleged violation of the model code of conduct.The AAP convenor responded by going ballistic against the poll panel and Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar and said, ""I want to tell Rajiv Kumarji, history will not forgive you. The amount of damage you have done to the EC, I don't think it has ever been tarnished this badly in India's history. I know that within two days, they will put me in jail. The kind of language the EC has used today is unprecedented. This is not the job of the EC.""He went on to say that if Kumar wanted to engage in politics, he should contest an election. ""Let him stand as a candidate from any assembly seat in Delhi,"" he said.The EC letter said Kejriwal, being a prominent public figure and former chief minister, should be aware of the dire consequences that such utterances can have and how they can leave permanent scars between residents of Haryana and Delhi. The poll panel also noted that in its notice on Tuesday, it had elaborated the legal and regulatory provisions attracted by his claims if not proved true.EC's assertions indicate that any dissatisfaction with Kejriwal's reply to its five pointed queries - the kind of poison mixed by Haryana in Yamuna; supporting evidence of the quantity, nature and manner of detecting the poison; locations where the poison was detected; which DJB engineers detected it and how and where; and the methodology employed by those engineers to stop the poisonous water from entering Delhi - may lead the poll panel to consider directing Delhi Police to file an FIR invoking Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita Section 196 (statements that promote enmity between groups), Section 197 (imputations prejudicial to national integration) and Section 353 (public mischief), as also Section 123(4) of the Representation of the People Act (false statement equivalent to a corrupt practice).All three BNS sections attract up to three years in prison, or fine, or both. Separately, EC may initiate action against Kejriwal for violating model code provisions that restrain parties and candidates from activities that create hatred and tension between groups.The poll panel on Thursday told Kejriwal that his reply was ""entirely silent"" on his public and widely circulated campaign statement of 'poisoning' of Yamuna waters. ""Instead of clarifying factual and legal matrix of your statement you have chosen to justify it under the question on high ammonia content in the river Yamuna in Delhi,"" EC said as it reminded Kejriwal that the commission was dealing separately with the matter already raised by the chief ministers of Delhi and Punjab. It said Haryana govt's inputs on the issue were also being considered. TOI had exclusively reported om Wedneday's EC's response to Kejriwal's reply to its notice.On Kejriwal's request for EC's intervention to ensure availability of sufficient and safe water, the commission said the matter was best left to the competence and discretion of the govts and the agencies concerned.","The poll panel on Thursday told Kejriwal that his reply was ""entirely silent"" on his public and widely circulated campaign statement of 'poisoning' of Yamuna waters.
