Justice Verma Removal Case Sparks BJP-Congress Face-Off Amid VP Jagdeep Dhankhar’s Shock Resignation

LS Speaker may write to CJI this week for panel members’ names

NEW DELHI: Facing removal motion in Parliament for sacks of cash found at his official residence in Delhi, Justice Yashwant Varma has kept his identity a secret in his petition in the Supreme Court while seeking quashing of the in-house inquiry report and then CJI's recommendation for stripping him of judgeship.A bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and Augustine George Masih is scheduled to hear his petition on Monday. In the petition, his name is described as ""XXX"". Such camouflage is used in records of SC and HCs to hide the identity of petitioner women who were sexually harassed or assaulted. It is also used to prevent revealing the identity of juveniles, and minors in matrimonial custody battles. SC has in many judgments asked all courts not to reveal the names of rape survivors in judgments.Justice Varma's plea - titled ""XXX vs Union of India"" - is the 699th civil writ petition filed in SC this year. While the Centre is the first respondent, SC itself is the second respondent. It was filed on July 17, and after the advocate on record rectified defects pointed out by the registry, SC registered the petition on July 24.Interestingly, while the petition ""XXX vs Union of India"" is listed at serial number 56 before the bench headed by Justice Datta, another petition by advocate Mathews J Nedumpara, seeking registration of FIR against Justice Varma to unravel the mystery behind the cash, its burning and subsequent disappearance, is listed at serial number 59 before the same bench on Monday.Meanwhile, Lok Sabha has admitted a notice for removal against Justice Varma signed by more than 150 MPs. The LS speaker is likely to write this week to CJI B R Gavai seeking names of an SC judge and an HC chief justice, who would be part of an inquiry committee under the Judges Inquiry Act, 1968.The speaker will nominate a distinguished jurist to complete the composition of the three-member committee headed by the SC judge. Repatriated to the Allahabad HC from the Delhi HC after the 'cash-in-kothi' controversy, Justice Varma in his petition has challenged the validity of the in-house inquiry report finding him guilty of the unaccounted cash at his residential premises and requested SC to declare the then CJI Sanjiv Khanna's May 8 recommendation to the President and the PM for his removal as unconstitutional.","Justice Yashwant Varma has kept his identity a secret in his petition in the Supreme Court.

"Varma row: Ignoring RS notice illegal, says Congress; 'petty mindset'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ignoring-rajya-sabha-notice-illegal-says-congress/articleshow/122941330.cms,"Abhishek Manu Singhvi

NEW DELHI: Accusing BJP of ""petty mindset"" and ""illegality"", Congress on Saturday said the government's decision to ignore the notice to remove Justice Yashwant Varma in Rajya Sabha in favour of the one submitted in Lok Sabha is dictated by its desire to control the narrative about the issue, stemming from its ""insecurity"" that the opposition had scored on corruption by moving first in the upper house. LS notice is bipartisan signed by 152 MPs, while the one in RS is exclusively signed by opposition members.Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi slammed the announcement by parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju , alleging it was now clear that former RS chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar's belated independent act on the Varma issue riled the Modi government and resulted in his ouster. With Rijiju saying that the RS had not ""admitted"" the notice, Singhvi said Dhankhar mentioned the notice in the House in detail on Monday talking about it meeting legal and numerical requirements, which was tantamount to admitting it. The Congress MP asked the government if RS should be giving long judgments like a judicial court to show ""admission"".Interestingly, Singhvi, a senior lawyer, alleged BJP MPs signed a blank paper in the room of defence minister Rajnath Singh on Monday, which was likely an ""impeachment notice against Dhankhar"". He warned that the government may be committing a major violation by constituting the statutory committee to probe Varma exclusively on the LS notice.","Abhishek Singhvi accuses BJP of ""petty mindset"" and ""illegality"" He says the government's decision to ignore the notice to remove Justice Yashwant Varma in Rajya Sabha is dictated by its desire to control the narrative about the issue.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122941387,imgsize-905370,width-400,resizemode-4/122941387.jpg"

Explosives Found Near Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah's Event Venue In Bengaluru, Major Attack Foiled





BENGALURU/NEW DELHI: A turf war between Karnataka’s top political bosses spilled over into a dramatic public spat in Delhi on Friday, as aides of chief minister Siddaramaiah and his deputy DK Shivakumar clashed inside Karnataka Bhavan, prompting formal complaints and calls for an inquiry.According to multiple sources, the incident involved C Mohan Kumar, special duty ofﬁcer (SDO) to the CM, and H Anjaneya, SDO to the deputy CM.The confrontation reportedly heated up when Mohan Kumar shouted at Anjaneya, threatening to hit him.This was allegedly said in front of other govt staff.Anjaneya filed a formal complaint with the additional resident commissioner (ARC) and Karnataka chief secretary Shalini Rajneesh, seeking action against Mohan Kumar for issuing threats.In his letter, Anjaneya claimed that if he were to meet any “accident”, then Mohan Kumar would be responsible. The officer went on to claim that Kumar has a history of violence with another person also being hit by him.""I was beaten with a shoe and it has hurt my honour and dignity. Conduct a criminal trial against him (Kumar) and give me justice,"" Anjanaya said in his complaint.“I seek a departmental inquiry against Kumar,” he said in his letter.What started as a verbal dispute between the two aides escalated after women employees at Karnataka Bhavan allegedly accused the DCM’s aide of using unparliamentary language and abusive terms in their presence earlier that day.CMO officials claim the situation worsened when Mohan Kumar confronted Anjaneya over his remarks about the women staff.This confrontation soon degenerated into a full-blown verbal brawl between the two SDOs.Later in the evening, the aggrieved women staff reportedly met Siddaramaiah and expressed concern over the behaviour of the DCM’s officer. Following the meeting, the chief minister directed the ARC to examine the complaint and initiate an inquiry, if necessary.","Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah and his deputy DK Shivakumar's aides clashed inside Karnataka Bhavan.

NEW DELHI: BJP leader and actor Mithun Chakraborty on Thursday dismissed West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee ’s recent claims that Bengali migrant workers were being targeted in other states.Chakraborty termed the remarks as an attempt to stir unnecessary controversy and spread fear among the public.Responding to Banerjee’s concerns over the safety of Bengali-speaking migrants, Chakraborty said, “These are all lies. I opened a hotel in Bengaluru where most of the workers were Bengali migrants. There were no Bangladeshis. But if someone is Bangladeshi, they will obviously be identified as Bangladeshi.”He accused the chief minister of politicising the issue. “She wants to create controversy in everything. Nothing is going to happen. Bangla language will remain as it is. Mamata Banerjee has got no monopoly over it. We will put up a strong fight,” he said.Chakraborty also criticised Banerjee’s call to gherao the Election Commission over alleged voter list tampering in Bengal and Bihar.""She (Mamata) has no other option, but this will definitely happen. The Election Commission must act. Fake and bogus voters have to be removed, only then will elections be fair.Even if the Commission is gheraoed, what will that achieve?
