What is condition of schools in UP, asks Kejriwal

NEW DELHI: Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath , during a BJP rally in Delhi on Thursday, took repeated jabs at AAP and its chief, Arvind Kejriwal , accusing the party of hindering Delhi's development over the past decade.Yogi also emphasised the need for the BJP’s ""double-engine"" government to be implemented in the capital.The UP CM alleged that AAP and its ministers are facilitating the settlement of illegal Bangladeshis and Rohingyas in the Okhla area of Delhi. He blamed Kejriwal for allegedly turning the holy Yamuna river into a ""dirty drain"" and calling it a ""sin"".""Yesterday, I along with all my ministers took a holy dip at the Sangam in Prayagraj where Maha Kumbh is on. I want to ask Kejriwal whether he can bathe in the Yamuna in Delhi along with his ministers. He should answer if he has any moral courage,"" Yogi said.Yogi claimed that the AAP government has turned Delhi into a “garbage dump” and neglected essential services like clean water, electricity, and promised subsidies that were never delivered to the people. He also criticised AAP for the poor state of roads, sanitation, drinking water issues, and sewer overflows in the national capital.Yogi further drew comparisons between Uttar Pradesh and Delhi, claiming that the roads in Noida and Ghaziabad in UP are far better than those in the national capital. He also highlighted the ongoing Mahakumbh in Prayagraj, praising its scale and significance.Yogi Adityanath's speech marked his first rally in the Kirari area ahead of the February 5 Delhi Assembly polls, with the results set to be announced on February 8.Meanwhile, Arvind Kejriwal took a shot at the UP CM, asking about the condition of government schools in UP and criticizing Yogi Adityanath. ""His [Yogi] government has been in power for more than 10 years, he has not been able to fix the government schools.""The AAP convener further claimed that AAP could teach UP ""how to fix government schools."" These jibes were made as Yogi was rallying in Delhi ahead of the Assembly elections.""Yogi Adityanath ji has come to Delhi, I want to ask him that the condition of government schools in UP is so bad, his government has been in power for more than 10 years, he has not been able to fix the government schools. If they need, we will send our education minister from Delhi. We will teach Uttar Pradesh how to fix government schools. Bharatiya Janata Party is in power in 20 states, the condition of government schools is bad in all their 20 states. If BJP says, we will send our education minister to BJP states. So that BJP can also learn and fix the government schools in their states,"" said Kejriwal.The AAP national convenor further said that ""under the AAP government, a family is able to save Rs 20,000-22,000, but if you press the lotus button (BJP's symbol) then you will not be able to live in Delhi, you will have to leave Delhi, because where will you get Rs 20,000 per month from?.""""3 days ago, BJP announced that if their government is formed in Delhi, they will stop free education in government schools. If you press the lotus button (BJP's symbol), then schools, Mohalla clinics, free bus rides for women will be stopped,"" Kejriwal added.AAP's Arvind Kejriwal is set to face off against BJP’s Parvesh Verma and Congress’ Sandeep Dikshit, with 23 candidates contesting the high-profile New Delhi constituency seat.","Yogi Adityanath took repeated jabs at AAP and its chief, Arvind Kejriwal.

Maharashtra stalls issuing delayed birth certificates amid illegal migrants row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maharashtra-stalls-issuing-delayed-birth-certs-amid-illegal-migrants-row/articleshow/117498514.cms,"NASHIK/PUNE: Birth and death certificates applied for a year or more past the relevant dates won't be issued in Maharashtra till the system undergoes a hygiene check, Mahayuti govt has notified amid a row over suspected illegal Bangladeshi and Rohingya immigrants fraudulently obtaining such documents in parts of the state.Top revenue officials told TOI that the issuance of certificates would be kept on hold for at least six months in all districts.Former BJP MP Kirit Somaiya alleged that 4,318 Bangladeshis and Rohingya in Malegaon, 4,537 in Amravati and more than 15,000 in Akola had been issued birth certificates based on forged documents. The state home department has set up a special investigation team to investigate the allegations. The report is expected after six months.A senior official of the Nashik administration said the state govt's communication to divisional commissioners and district collectors cites several complaints about laws being bypassed to approve delayed applications for birth and death certificates.Until 2023, applications delayed by a year and more required judicial approval. The central govt then amended the law, granting authority to district collectors and sub-divisional officers to approve such applications.The change led to alleged misuse of the system in districts like Malegaon and Amravati, where reports suggest that thousands of fake birth certificates have been issued to Bangladeshi and Rohingya immigrants. Data from all districts is being collated as part of the probe, officials said.Malegaon's AIMIM MLA Mohammed Khaliq accused BJP's Somaiya of defaming his constituency since the saffron party lost the Lok Sabha election there. ""What were the central and state home ministries, both managed by BJP, doing when these people entered India and the state?"" he said.In Pune district, 2,470 delayed birth certificates and 1,488 delayed death certificates have been kept on hold and are being scrutinised, district administration officials said. Shirur has the maximum number of delayed birth-certificate applications at 680, followed by Velhe. The latter tops the list of delayed death registrations.",Birth and death certificates applied for a year or more past the relevant dates won't be issued in Maharashtra. This is amid a row over suspected illegal Bangladeshi and Rohingya immigrants fraudulently obtaining such documents.
