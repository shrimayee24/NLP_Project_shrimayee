9 die as goods train rear-ends Kanchanjungha Express in Bengal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/9-die-as-goods-train-rear-ends-kanchanjungha-express-in-bengal/articleshow/111067266.cms,"SILIGURI/ KOLKATA: A goods train allegedly disregarded a signal and rear-ended the Sealdah-bound Kanchanjungha Express near north Bengal's New Jalpaiguri station at 8.55am Monday, causing four bogies and five freight containers to derail. At least nine people died and 41 were injured in the accident that was eerily similar to the three-train pile-up near Odisha's Balasore last June that killed 296.Five of the nine who died were in a general compartment ahead of two parcel vans of the express train that seemingly absorbed most of the impact of the crash between Rangapani and Chattar Hat stations, around 11km from New Jalpaiguri. Four passenger trains had passed that stretch minutes before the accident.Among the casualties were loco pilot Anil Kumar of the goods train, Kanchanjungha Express guard Ashish Dey, state excise inspector Kaleb Subba, railway employee Shankar Mohan Das, and passengers Subhajit Mali and Beauty Begum. Three of the dead hadn't been identified till late evening.The four derailed bogies of the express and five cargo containers fell on the adjoining track, stalling rail traffic along a stretch of the lone route that connects Guwahati and the Northeast with the rest of the country. Kavach, the railways' automatic anti-collision system, has not been installed on this busy route yet.Railway Board chairperson and CEO Jaya Varma Sinha said a ""human error"" by the deceased loco pilot of the goods train may have triggered the collision, while railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said at the accident site that a thorough inquiry by the Commission of Railway Safety would reveal the cause. ""The railway accident is saddening. Condolences to those who lost their loved ones. I pray that the injured recover at the earliest. Spoke to officials and took stock of the situation,"" PM Modi posted on X.The PMO first announced compensation of Rs 2 lakh to the families of each of the deceased. Vaishnaw later said families of each of the deceased would receive Rs 10 lakh and those who suffered serious injuries would get Rs 2.5 lakh each. For minor injuries, the amount is Rs 50,000.Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee accused the railways of not caring for passenger safety. ""They are only keen on hiking fares,"" she said.A passenger in one of the compartments in the middle said he felt a huge jolt, followed by pandemonium. ""Passengers were running helter-skelter. There were screams all around. We got off the train and ran towards the rear. What we saw was shocking. One bogie had turned over, another appeared to be hanging in the air. A third was mangled.""The first responders were local residents. Police, railway and administrative officials reached the spot later along with NDRF personnel.

BJP has also planned to hold a protest against the petrol price increase on Monday.The Karnataka government announced a hike in petrol and diesel prices by Rs 3 per litre and Rs 3.02 per litre respectively, effective immediately, garnering strong reactions and concerns from opposition leaders and residents.BJP Spokesperson S Prakash called out the Siddaramaiah-led Congress government for substantially raising petrol prices in the state immediately after the parliamentary elections concluded. ""People were expecting Rs 8,000 into their accounts by Rahul Gandhi, on the contrary, they have been hugely burdened by petroleum products,"" he said.BJP leader BY Vijayendra said, ""Faced by defeat in Lok Sabha polls, the chief minister is not ready to accept that the financial situation of the state has deteriorated, but the hike in fuel prices proves it. The government is unable to run the administration because of guarantees, they are unable to get proper resources. The government should withdraw this decision (of fuel price hike). ""On Monday, we are going to organise protests across Karnataka,"" he added.The price surge has been linked to the state government's decision to adjust the sales tax on petroleum products, according to the Petroleum Dealers Association.

Delhi water crisis: Atishi alleges BJP sabotage; wants police protection for pipelines,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhi-water-crisis-atishi-alleges-bjp-sabotage-wants-police-protection-for-pipelines/articleshow/111047822.cms,"NEW DELHI: Delhi water minister Atishi wrote to police commissioner Sanjay Arora on Sunday, requesting deployment of personnel for protection of major pipelines for the next 15 days as a Delhi Jal Board patrol team had found signs of sabotage at several spots of the water network.Later in the day at a press conference, the minister alleged the possibility of BJP's hand in the damage to the pipelines.Atishi's letter to the police commissioner said that production of treated water had reduced by about ""70 MGD"".She wrote that Delhi Jal Board had deployed patrol teams to check the main distribution network that carries raw water to the treatment plants, and from there to the main underground reservoirs in different parts of the city. ""In addition, we have deployed teams under the supervision of ADMs to support this work,"" she wrote.The minister said that on Saturday, DJB's patrol team found a major leakage in the main pipeline that carries water from the Sonia Vihar treatment plant to south Delhi. ""This (the leak) was near the DTL substation in Garhi Medhu. Our patrolling team found that several large 375 mm bolts and one 12-inch bolt had been cut from the pipeline, causing leakage. The fact that several large bolts had been cut seems to indicate foul play and sabotage,"" the letter said.Atishi requested Arora to deploy police personnel to prevent ""miscreants or people with ulterior motives"" from ""tampering with the water pipelines "".About the damaged pipeline, she mentioned that a team worked for six hours and repaired the leak. ""But this meant that we had to stop pumping water for 6 hours, and 20 MGD was not pumped during this time. As a consequence, a further 25% of water shortage will be experienced in south Delhi,"" she added.Minister Saurabh Bharadwaj mentioned that several areas in south Delhi such as Greater Kailash, Kalkaji and Chirag Delhi, had got less water because the Sonia Vihar pipeline had been tampered with. ""There are plates to join the pipelines and bolts to clamp the plate. Some miscreants had cut them, leading to the leakage. For repairs, the line had to be shut down,"" he said in a video message.Bharadwaj denied claims that the leaks were not being addressed. He said miscreants were deliberately damaging the pipelines and then making videos to defame Delhi govt.At her news conference, Atishi wondered aloud how BJP functionaries had reached the broken pipelines. ""They click photos. Yesterday, the pipeline that supplies water to south Delhi from Sonia Vihar was found broken. Was this pipeline broken intentionally This would not have happened on its own. This is also a part of the conspiracy,"" she said.Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva said that it was regrettable that instead of working to fix leaks in pipelines and check water theft, Atishi was trying put blame BJP. ""Tomorrow BJP workers will hold protests across the city in 52 places against Kejriwal govt's failure to check leaks and water theft,"" he said.Later on Sunday, AAP MLA Dilip Pandey, along with his supporters, reached the residence of Union water minister CR Patil, demanding his intervention. ""We have written to Union water minister CR Patil, asking him to intervene and solve the problem. Today, we came to meet him regarding the matter. Although we did not meet him, we have given him the letter through his office,"" he said.BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said the AAP MLAs were refusing to follow Atishi's order that MLAs should go to Patil's home.

Assembly elections: BJP hits the ground running to counter INDIA bloc's Lok Sabha gains,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/assembly-elections-bjp-hits-the-ground-running-to-counter-india-blocs-lok-sabha-gains/articleshow/111063441.cms,"First electoral test after LS polls

But why are these elections so important for the saffron party?

Can INDIA bloc continue with its dream run?

NEW DELHI: The BJP, which failed to get majority on its own in the just concluded Lok Sabha elections, has taken a head-start for the assembly elections in three key states due later this year. Maharashtra, Haryana and Jharkhand will vote to elect a new government between October and December this year. BJP chief JP Nadda on Monday appointed party leaders Bhupinder Yadav and Ashwini Vaishnaw as state election incharge and co-incharge for Maharashtra, while Dharmendra Pradhan and Biplab Kumar Dev have been made election incharges for Haryana. In Jharkhand, the BJP has picked senior leader Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma as the party's election incharges.The assembly elections will be first litmus test for both the BJP and the INDIA bloc . The saffron party is still smarting from its below-expectation performance in Lok Sabha elections. The BJP did win 240 Lok Sabha seats to emerge as the single largest party, which was more than the combined total of all the opposition parties. But the tally was way behind its much-hyped claim of 370 seats for the party and ""400-paar"" for the ruling coalition NDA. Also, the reduced number of 240 meant that the party is now dependent on its allies for the survival of the government. Contrast this to the overwhelming mandate BJP received in 2014 and 2019 - when it won a majority on its own with 282 and 303 seats respectively. This perhaps explains why the BJP's 2024 performance was not good enough.Maharashtra, Haryana and Jharkhand have been BJP bastions for long. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP won 23 out of 48 seats in Maharashtra, 10 out of 10 seats in Haryana and 11 out of 14 seats in Jharkhand. In 2014 also, the party had performed very well in these states: 23 in Maharashtra, 7 in Haryana and 12 in Jharkhand. Little wonder, these states were among the ones that were supposed to power the BJP's ambitious target of ""400-paar."" However, the voters in these states had a surprise in store for the BJP in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. The saffron party won only 9 seats in Maharashtra, 5 in Haryana and 8 in Jharkhand.What makes this Lok Sabha result more worrying for the BJP is the fact that traditionally people of these states have voted in huge numbers for the saffron party in national elections even if they have chosen some other party in the state elections.An example of this was in 2018 when the Congress defeated the BJP in the Hindi heartland states of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh and formed its government ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. However, when it came to the national elections, the people of the three states voted overwhelmingly for the BJP once again giving the party 24 out of 25 Lok Sabha seats in Madhya Pradesh, 9 out of 11 seats in Chhattisgarh and 24 out of 25 seats in Rajasthan.With assembly elections just months away, the BJP has to act fast and get its house in order in the three key states. While it has to defend its government in Maharashtra and Haryana, in Jharkhand it will have to wrest it back from the INDIA bloc.In Maharashtra particularly, with a RSS-linked magazine questioning the wisdom of BJP's alliance with Ajit Pawar, the saffron party will have to take some quick decisions. The BJP contested Lok Sabha elections in alliance with Eknath Shinde led Shiv Sena and Ajit Pawar's NCP. Both these leaders had split their parties to joined hands with the BJP. There are reports that the BJP has commissioned a survey to assess if it should fight the assembly elections in the state alone or in alliance with these two parties.Haryana has already seen a leadership change and the BJP would hope that it marks the beginning of party's course correction in the state. In Jharkhand, the BJP would try to capitalise on the arrest of former chief minister Hemant Soren and senior Congress leader Alamgir Alam to put the ruling coalition under pressure.The opposition's INDIA (Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance) bloc surprised everyone, including pollsters, with their better-than-expectation performance in 2024 Lok Sabha elections. But will they be able to carry the momentum forward?Well, in Maharashtra at least they have shown the urgency and the need to act fast to consolidate their gains. The first meeting of the Maha Vikas Aghadi alliance partners - Congress, Shiv Sena (UBT) and Sharad Pawar's NCP - has already been held. The top leaders have made the right noises for the electoral battle ahead. However, to keep the momentum going, they will first have to smoothly negotiate the first hurdle of seat-sharing. After the meeting, senior leader Sharad Pawar had a backhanded compliment for PM Modi as he claimed that the opposition alliance won in most of the seats where the Prime Minister campaigned.In Jharkhand and Haryana, the opposition alliance will have to make quick moves to counter a determined BJP. While opposition parties in these three states have had a better rate of success against the BJP in state elections, they would do well not to become complacent and fritter away the Lok Sabha advantage.","Maharashtra, Haryana and Jharkhand will vote to elect a new government between October and December this year. The assembly elections will be first litmus test for both the BJP and the INDIA bloc.

I am very happy to be able to represent Wayanad . All I'll say is that I won't let them feel his (Rahul's) absence. I will work hard and try my best to make everybody happy and be a good representative,"" Priyanka said after her candidature was announced on Monday.""I have a good relation with Rae Bareli as I have worked there for 20 years and that relation will never break,"" she said and added that both of them will work together in both the constituencies.Priyanka played an important role in Uttar Pradesh in the just concluded Lok Sabha elections. The Congress leader not just campaigned extensively to help the party win in prestige seats of Raebareli and Amethi, but she was instrumental in stitching the alliance with Akhilesh Yadav's Samajwadi Party- that eventually proved to be a winning combination for both parties.When negotiations between the two parties had a hit a roadblock over seat sharing, it was Priyanka who dialled Akhilesh and put the alliance back on track.Priyanka's role in Congress's performance in Uttar Pradesh is all the more significant as she had a difficult debut in the state in January 2019 when she was made the general secretary in-charge for crucial eastern Uttar Pradesh and then as the general secretary in-charge of the entire state.The party then registered its worst-ever performance in the state. But the Congress leader continued her efforts to strengthen the organisation at the grassroots level and finally the party seems to be on the path of revival in the politically crucial state.She also led the party's campaign in Himachal Pradesh assembly elections and helped the Congress come to power in the hill state.Congress leaders have often projected her as the new crisis manager of the party. When Sachin Pilot had rebelled against the then chief minister of Rajasthan Ashok Gehlot, it was Priyanka had played a key role in ensuring that Pilot stayed with the Congress.In the just-concluded Lok Sabha elections, Priyanka was one of the star campaigners. She targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi in her speeches and countered his charges against the grand old party. Priyanka's supporters would have hoped to see her contest from her karmabhoomi of Uttar Pradesh. But for now it is Wayanad calling.If Priyanka wins the Lok Sabha bypolls, it would be for the first time that three members of the Gandhi family will be in Parliament. Her mother Sonia Gandhi is a Rajya Sabha member from Rajasthan.","Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has agreed to take the plunge into electoral politics.

The mother has entered the Rajya Sabha, the son has entered the Lok Sabha from one seat, and Priyanka Gandhi has been made a member from another Lok Sabha seat. All three members of the family will be in the Parliament."" He further claimed that Rahul Gandhi, despite his win in Rae Bareli, is dependent on the Samajwadi Party's support and is unwilling to risk a by-election, which he believes could jeopardize a second victory.Poonawalla also criticized Rahul Gandhi's move to Wayanad, asserting that it was a betrayal to the people of the constituency. ""Annie Raja kept saying that Rahul Gandhi would move out of the state after the elections, which he did,"" he said, adding, ""Another thing has become very clear: the political legacy of the family will be with the son and not the daughter.""Earlier today, Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge announced that Rahul Gandhi would continue to represent Rae Bareli in the 18th Lok Sabha, while Priyanka Gandhi would contest from Wayanad. Kharge said that, ""Rahul Gandhi was elected from two seats. As per rules, he will have to vacate one seat and continue on one seat. Since June 18 is the last date, we have decided that Rahul should keep his Rae Bareli seat, since it has been very close to the family for a long time. He has received love from the people of Wayanad, and people there want him to retain the seat, but the rules do not allow it.

PM Modi likely to propose Speaker name on June 25,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-likely-to-propose-speaker-name-on-june-25/articleshow/111066881.cms,"NEW DELHI: After new members' oath-taking is completed on the first two days of Lok Sabha session, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to propose the name of the new Lok Sabha Speaker on June 25 even as the BJP-led NDA , which has the majority, has still not announced its candidate's name.The first session of the 18th Lok Sabha is scheduled to commence from June 24 to July 3 and is likely to be reconvened in the last week of July for the Budget session. Sources said that BJP is likely to retain the Speaker's post and not offer it to allies as it has far greater numbers than the NDA partners.Since the President has notified June 26 as the date for the Speaker's election, it is expected that the PM will propose the name for a consensus a day in advance, as all Speakers have so far been elected with a consensus. However, the opposition has threatened to field a candidate this time in case the post of deputy Lok Sabha Speaker is not given to them.In the 12th Lok Sabha, under former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee - which lasted for 13 months, from March 10, 1998 to April 26, 1999-TDP leader G M C Balayogi was elected the Speaker in March 1998. He held the post for five years until 2002.In 2002, during the full five-year term (1999-2004) of the BJP-led NDA government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee as PM, Shiv Sena's Manohar Joshi was elected Speaker after the death of Balayogi in 2002.In 2014 under the leadership of Narendra Modi, BJP alone won a total of 282 seats, more than the magic figure while together with NDA, its total strength in the LS was 336. The Party nominated Sumitra Mahajan for the post. In 2019, it improved its tally winning 303 seats on its own while the NDA tally was 353. Om Birla was nominated the Speaker in 2019.Even in 2024, BJP is the single largest party with 240 seats, 32 seats short of the majority mark. However, the party is better placed than the Vajpayee era when it could not cross the 200 figure and its survival was critically dependent on the allies.",Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to propose the name of the new Lok Sabha Speaker on June 25. The first session of the 18th Lok Sabha is scheduled to commence from June 24 to July 3.

Consensual relationship is not a licence to assault woman: HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/consensual-relationship-is-not-a-licence-to-assault-woman-hc/articleshow/111067020.cms,"FIR challenged

BENGALURU: A consensual relationship between the accused and the complainant-woman is not a licence for the former to assault the latter, the high court has observed.Justice M Nagaprasanna, however, quashed the offences of rape and cheating invoked against the petitioner. Both the petitioner and the woman are residents of Bengaluru and worked together in a software company . They were in a relationship for over five years.In July 2022, the woman lodged a police complaint alleging that the man had a physical relationship with her on the promise of marriage but breached it later. Following this, Annapoorneshwari Nagar police registered a case for offences punishable under Sections 376 (punishment for rape), 323 (causing hurt), 417 (punishment for cheating), 504 (intentional insult) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC.The man challenged the FIR and argued that in February 2020, the woman had filed a similar complaint against another person alleging that he also had indulged in sexual acts on the promise of marriage and the same was pending. He claimed that the woman has the habit of filing criminal complaints against different men. On the other hand, the woman remained absent.After perusing the material on record, Justice Nagaprasanna noted the rape and cheating charges cannot be sustained in the wake of consensual relationship.""The facts obtained in the case are considered on the bedrock of the principles enunciated by the Supreme Court in Shambhu Karwar vs State of Uttar Pradesh case. The offence of rape is loosely laid against the petitioner and if further investigation is permitted to continue against the petitioner as is continuing against the other man, it would be permitting the complainant to sail in two different complaints at the same time. Therefore, the offence of rape could not have been laid against the petitioner. It needs to be obliterated,"" the judge said.As regards to assault and criminal intimidation charges, Justice Nagaprasanna noted that a perusal of the wound certificate would indicate that there has been multiple bruises on the body of the complainant.""The bruises are on account of assault allegedly by the accused-petitioner. Therefore, while the offence under section 376 of the IPC or 417 of the IPC cannot be made out, the offence under Sections 323 (causing hurt) and 504 of the IPC are prima facie met,"" the judge observed, while permitting police to investigate those charges.The petitioner can avail of such remedy as is available in law if the investigation leads to filing of the chargesheet against him, the judge added, while partly allowing the petition.",Both the petitioner and the woman are residents of Bengaluru and worked together in a software company.

The cellphone use had sparked allegations that it was used to generate one-time passwords (OTP) to access the EVMs there.

They made bus ride free and given free this and free that. Now they needed money to fulfil the khata-khat, khata-khat promise made by their young leader during (LS) poll campaign. So they decided to raise fuel prices, making people pay for the scheme,” Puri said without naming Rahul.The Congress had promised to launch annual social security dole of Rs 1 lakh if voted to power at the Centre. Rahul’s use of ‘khata-khat’, a colloquial expression for quick or immediately, caught the fancy of voters during the campaign. Thermal Congress had also promised a Rs 2,000 monthly payout for women during the May 2023 assembly election.Puri said the party had distributed pamphlets looking like some guarantee document during the (LS) poll campaign. “Women are landing up to claim their first instalment of Rs 8,500,” he said.On fuel prices being still higher in several states where BJP and/or its allies are in power, Puri said the hikes were affected by previous dispensations. On why the BJP and its allies are not bringing down the prices by paring state levies, he said many BJP-ruled states had done so in the past, matching the Centre’s excise duty reduction.Petrol, for example costs Rs 106.45 a litre in Bhopal, Rs 105.16 in Patna (BJP in coalition with JD-U), Rs 104.86 in Jaipur and Rs 104.19 in Mumbai. Even after the June 15 increase in state levies from 25.92% to 29.84% on petrol and from 14.3% to 18.4% on diesel, fuel in Karnataka is still cheaper than neighbouring states.",Oil minister Hardeep Puri hit out at the Congress government in Karnataka for raising fuel prices by Rs 3 a litre.

Emotional connection to both seats: Rahul Gandhi

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Ending weeks of suspense, Congress MP Rahul Gandhi on Monday finally decided on the Lok Sabha seat he will be representing.In the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, Rahul had won from both the Rae Bareli seat in Uttar Pradesh and Wayanad seat in Kerala. Speculation had been rife over which seat he would choose to represent in the 18th Lok Sabha.After a high-level party meeting on Monday, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge announced that Rahul would be representing the Rae Bareli seat while Priyanka Gandhi will fight in the bypolls for the Wayanad seat.""Rahul Gandhi was elected from two (Lok Sabha) seats. As per rules, he will have to vacate one seat and continue on one seat. Since June 18 is the last date, we have decided that Rahul should keep his Rae Bareli seat, since it has been very close to the family since a long time. He has received love from people of Wayanad, and people there want him to retain the seat but the rules do not allow it. So, after a lot of deliberations, we decided that Priyanka Gandhi should contest from Wayanad, and she has agreed for the same,"" said Kharge.This will be the first time that Priyanka will be entering the election fray.""I am very happy to be able to represent Wayanad. All I can say is that I won't let them (people) feel his (Rahul Gandhi's) absence. As Rahul said, he will come many times with me but I will work hard and I will try to make everyone happy and be a good representative. I have a special connection with Rae Bareli. I have worked for 20 years in both Rae Bareli and Amethi,"" said Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.After Kharge's announcement, Rahul said he had an ""emotional connection with both Rae Bareli and Wayanad"".""I was the Wayanad MP for the last five years and people of Wayanad gave me love, for which I thank them. Priyanka will contest from Wayanad, but I will continue to visit Wayanad and the promises we made to Wayanad ... we will fulfil them. I have a long relation with Rae Bareli and I am very happy that I will be representing it. This was not an easy decision, because affection is with both (Wayanad and Raebareli),"" he said.""Priyanka Gandhi is going to fight the elections and I am confident that she is going to win the elections. The people of Wayanad can think that they have 2 Members of the Parliament, one is my sister and the other is me.

North Goa MP Shripad Naik on Monday reiterated his wish to retire from Parliament after his current term, but the minister of state for power said that a return to state politics or even to the Lok Sabha can’t be ruled out.He said that as a loyal BJP karyakarta, he would abide by the decisions of the party’s central leadership.“This is my last term in the Lok Sabha,” Naik told Marathi journalists.

I am a party karyakarta. I am a soldier of the party. Whatever the party leadership tells me, I will obey their orders,” said Naik.Naik was asked the same question about his interest in state politics by a local television channel.“This party, without me asking or saying anything, got me elected for six terms. I won by a big margin. These (wins) have been given to me by the party, I didn’t ask for any of this.” he said.“I have fulfilled the responsibility that was given to me.

Mexico's incoming president Claudia Sheinbaum says surveys show support for controversial judicial reforms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/mexicos-incoming-president-says-surveys-show-support-for-controversial-judicial-reforms/articleshow/111071834.cms,"MEXICO : In a move reminiscent of her political mentor , incoming Mexican president Claudia Sheinbaum on Monday displayed a series of surveys commissioned by her political party that she said show a wide majority approve of controversial judicial changes.Sheinbaum said the surveys were just ""informational."" She said the polling was done over the weekend and included face-to-face interviews of thousands of eligible voters across Mexico.Everyone should do ""their own analysis of the results,"" she said.The polls, which are not binding in any way, are a page from the playbook of her political mentor, president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who will be succeeded by Sheinbaum on October 1.Critics have questioned the use of the public surveys, calling them more of a public relations ploy to help build momentum to pass legislation.Lopez Obrador carried out one of his own campaign promises six years ago when he submitted a partially built $13 billion Mexico city airport project to a national consultation between his own election and taking office. That survey also came down on his side and he cancelled the project upon becoming president.In another survey, respondents overwhelmingly supported his pet project, the Maya Train, which now carries tourists around the Yucatan Peninsula.When the National Electoral Institute conducted a national referendum in 2021 on whether former presidents should be prosecuted for wrongdoing, voter turnout was so low that it didn't approach the level necessary to make it binding.Lopez Obrador has said he would pursue 20 constitutional changes after his Morena party won a two-thirds majority in Congress in the June 2 elections. They include making all judges run for election and enshrining a series of unfunded benefit mandates in Mexico's constitution.The country's judiciary has blocked several of Lopez Obrador's previous reforms, ruling them unconstitutional.Sheinbaum's surveys were conducted through private Mexican pollsters Enkoll and De Las Heras Demotecnia, in addition to her party's own commission of surveys. She said Morena did not intervene in any way with the different methodologies, giving them autonomy to conduct surveys throughout the country.Each poll was based on between 1,000 and 1,500 face-to-face interviews conducted between June 14 and 16. They had margins of error of plus or minus three percentage points.The surveys asked five questions, including whether participants knew the party is proposing judicial changes and whether they believe there is corruption within the judicial system.According to Morena, the surveys say nearly nine in 10 participants want the creation of an independent organization that would investigate and hold accountable judges in any act of corruption.The US has signaled concern about judiciary changes in Mexico.Last week, Brian Nichols, US assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs, urged that there be transparency in Mexico's judicial overhaul, particularly concerning any impact the changes could have on US investors and companies. The US ambassador to Mexico, Ken Salazar, said last week that a strong judicial system was important, but it was up to Mexicans to decide on the changes.","Incoming Mexican president Claudia Sheinbaum displays a series of surveys commissioned by her political party.
