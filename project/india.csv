MP liquor ban at holy places may not impact Ujjain mandir 'prasad',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mp-liquor-ban-at-holy-places-may-not-impact-ujjain-mandir-prasad/articleshow/117535428.cms,"While local officials await instructions from govt, chief minister Mohan Yadav was quite clear in replying to a reporter's query about Kal Bhairav temple. ""You may take the prasad to temple,"" the CM said.

INDORE/UJJAIN/MAHESHWAR/KHARGONE: Liquor ban at religious places in Madhya Pradesh has thrown up an interesting question-what of the famed Kal Bhairav Mandir in Ujjain where liquor is the main ""prasad""?In stalls outside the temple, every basket of offerings has a liquor bottle and a coconut. In fact, the state govt runs liquor counters outside the temple to ensure devotees are not swindled.While local officials await instructions from govt, chief minister Mohan Yadav was quite clear in replying to a reporter's query about Kal Bhairav temple. ""You may take the prasad to temple,"" the CM said. Asked if there was a complete ban on consumption of liquor in religious cities, he said: ""Arre... If we close down the shops, where will one get liquor to drink?"" Liquor shops in Ujjain will close from April 1 after the cabinet decision. But it seems liquor prasad will continue to be served at the temple of Lord Kal Bhairav.Temple priest Om Prakash Chaturvedi told TOI despite previous moves to ban liquor, ""traditions have never been broken at the temple"". ""Even during Simhastha festival in 2016, alcohol was offered to the deity despite a ban. The govt provides a counter through the excise department to ensure that devotees have access to alcohol for the offerings,"" he said.Offering alcohol to the deity is an ancient practice, he said. ""These deities are considered 'Tamasic'. Similarly, Goddess Kalika is also offered alcohol,"" he explained.Assistant commissioner (excise) Rajnarayan Soni said issue of alcohol ""prasad"" at the temple will be decided by govt. ""Currently, there are two (liquor) counters for devotees outside the temple. They are operated under excise department's supervision. There're no licensed shops nearby,"" he said.Hinting at prohibition, Yadav said: ""In the first step to bring about an end to drinking in the state, liquor vends in 19 holy towns will be shut down. These shops will not be shifted elsewhere. Liquor shops will be completely shut in Ujjain Municipal Corporation limits."" He said later that ""liquor will be banned in a systematic manner in other places as well"".","Chief minister Mohan Yadav was quite clear in replying to a reporter's query about Kal Bhairav temple.

"SC to name observer for 'free, fair' Chandigarh mayor poll",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-to-name-observer-for-free-fair-chandigarh-mayor-poll/articleshow/117535500.cms,"New Delhi: Supreme Court on Friday said it would appoint a retired high court judge as independent observer to ensure ""free and fair election"" to the mayor's post in Chandigarh, reports Dhananjay Mahapatra.The court rejected AAP leader and Chandigarh mayor Kuldeep Kumar's plea for a full one-year term from Feb 20, 2024, when the SC had declared him elected by quashing the election of BJP's Manoj Sonkar after detecting malpractices by the returning officer who forged ballot papers during counting of votes. While ordering that the mayor's poll would be held as scheduled on Jan 30, a bench of Justices Surya Kant and N K Singh issued notice to the Chandigarh administration on Kumar's plea for appointment of an independent observer to ensure free and fair election.The bench sought the Chandigarh administration's response by Monday to Kumar's petition, which claimed that though the municipal corporation had passed a resolution for voting through show of hands to avoid discrepancy or malpractice, the administration acted contrary to the resolution and notified voting through secret ballot. ""We will appoint a retired HC judge as independent observer to ensure free and fair election,"" the bench said while posting further hearing on Monday. The SC also said the election process would continue unhindered by the pendency of the petition in the SC, which means candidates can file their nomination papers.","The court rejected AAP leader and Chandigarh mayor Kuldeep Kumar's plea for a full one-year term from Feb 20, 2024.
