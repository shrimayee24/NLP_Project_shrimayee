NEW DELHI: Villagers from Sukma and Bastar in Chhattisgarh, who had been victims of Left-Wing extremism and Naxal violence, have written an open letter to Members of Parliament, urging them not to vote for Opposition bloc’s vice-presidential candidate B Sudershan Reddy.The letter points to Justice Reddy's order against the Salwa Judum movement - a state-backed campaign launched to drive out Naxals from Bastar.The villagers claim his judgment weakened efforts against insurgency. ""The entire Bastar region would have been peaceful, but after the 2011 Supreme Court verdict, Bastar has been trembling with fear,"" the letter reads.Raising sharp questions, the villagers ask: ""Should such a supporter of Naxals be seated on this post in the country?"" and ""Think again — what do Congress and its senior leaders want to establish by making such a person their candidate?""They further add, ""Is Congress against peace in Bastar?""The protest comes after the BJP named CP Radhakrishnan as its nominee for Vice-President, following which the Congress-led INDIA bloc declared Justice B Sudershan Reddy as its challenger.Villagers in Bastar and Sukma have now voiced concern over his candidacy, citing his past stance on Salwa Judum.Senior BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad also hit out at retired SC judge Reddy, alleging that his 2011 verdict on Salwa Judum reflected an “inclination towards Maoism.”“In India, the office of the Vice President holds the second-highest constitutional position. It is therefore crucial to understand the mindset and ideology of the person nominated for this post. Justice B Sudershan Reddy’s judgement on Salwa Judum clearly showed a compassionate attitude and inclination towards Maoism,” Prasad, a former Union law minister, said.","Villagers from Sukma and Bastar in Chhattisgarh have written an open letter to Members of Parliament, urging them not to vote for Opposition bloc’s vice- presidential candidate B Sudershan Reddy.

Kolkata: The Calcutta High Court on Monday called CBI probes ""a gallery show right now"" while turning down a plea for an investigation by the central agency into an East Midnapore murder in July. It, instead, said it would hand over the probe to the Bengal CID after taking the case out of the local police station.""The CBI is a gallery show right now. If I give CBI, it will just be a gallery show,"" Justice Tirthankar Ghosh told the father of a 22-year-old East Midnapore youth whose death had prompted the family to move court seeking a fresh autopsy and a CBI probe.Sujit Das and Sudhir Chandra Paik died during a social function in East Midnapore's Khejuri on July 12. Cops, after an initial probe, said the deaths were caused by electrocution but Sasanka (Sujit's dad who moved court) claimed his son was brutally assaulted by Trinamool supporters and cops were shielding the accused. The BJP had declared a local bandh after the deaths.The first autopsy, done by a district hospital in Tamluk, blamed electrocution for the death but a second (at SSKM Hospital) indicated assault as the cause of the death because the body bore bruise marks.Sasanka's counsel, Mayukh Mukherjee, told the judge on Monday that the family wanted a CBI probe as it did not have any faith in cops.""I am taking it out of the local police station and giv-ing it to the CID,"" Justice Ghosh said, responding to the plea. ""The CID additional director-general will constitute a special investigation team under the leadership of a deputy inspector-general and including officers from the CID's homicide section. You want investigation. There are two autopsy reports before this court, which have weakened the case for the accused persons,"" he added. The final order is likely to be pronounced on Tuesday.Mukherjee pleaded for a ""fair"" investigation, adding: ""Trial cannot start without a proper probe and that is why the case should be transferred to a competent agency.""

Delhi Polls: Kejriwal Attacks Election Commissioner; Shah Says People Will Sweep AAP Out With Broom

NEW DELHI: Former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday shot off a barbed response to Union home minister Amit Shah ’s recent interview, in which the BJP leader defended the government's 130th constitutional amendment bill.The bill proposes the removal of lawmakers detained or arrested for more than 30 days in cases carrying a punishment of five years or more.In the interview with news agency ANI, Shah asked if it was ""fair for ministers, chief ministers or even the prime minister—accused of corruption or facing charges with more than five years’ punishment -- to run the government from jail?""Responding to the Union home minister's question, Kejriwal posed a counter question asking: ""And what about a leader who inducts hardened criminals into his party, helps them wipe off their cases, and then rewards them with positions like minister, deputy chief minister, or even chief minister—should such a minister or prime minister not also be forced to step down? How many years of imprisonment should such a person face?""The AAP convenor further asked: ""Finally, if someone is falsely implicated in a case, sent to jail, and later acquitted, how many years of jail should the minister responsible for framing that false case get?""Kerjiwal had refused to step down as Delhi CM when he was jailed over the alleged scam linked to the scrapped Delhi liquor policy and continued to serve as chief minister from Tihar jail.Referring to the incident, Shah said: ""When the constitution was made, the constitution makers would not have imagined such shamelessness that any CM would go to jail and remain the CM from jail.""Shah said Kejriwal continued to serve as CM as the Delhi high court ruled that there was no provision in the law to remove him from the post.""When the case went to the high court, it was argued that Arvind Kejriwal should resign because he is in jail.The high Court said that we believe that he should resign on moral grounds but there is no provision in the current law. My party believes, the Prime Minister of the country believes that no CM, minister or PM in this country can run the government while being in jail,"" the Union home minister said.Kejriwal attacked Amit Shah over his statement, saying his 160-day government from jail was better than the current BJP-led Delhi government.""When the Centre conspired to frame me in false cases and sent me to jail, I ran the government for 160 days from behind bars. In the past seven months, the BJP government in Delhi has dragged the city into such a mess that people now recall those jail days of governance. At least back then, the power and water were available, medicines were free in hospitals and mohalla clinics, medical tests were free, one spell of rain didn’t throw the city into chaos, and private schools weren’t given a free hand to extort and bully parents,"" the ex-Delhi CM said.BJP's national spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla lashed out at Kejriwal over his remark, saying: ""During Covid we worked from home. Now they want 'Work from Jail' for the 1st time in India. Can a CM hold meetings from prison? Where will public hearings be held — inside jail rooms? How will we cope if their is any emergency? This fails both on morality and practicality.""In the interview, Shah also expressed confidence that the Constitution (130th Amendment) Bill, 2025, will be passed, despite the opposition's fierce criticism.Shah said it's aimed at upholding ""constitutional morality"" and public trust, emphasising that the bill would apply equally to all leaders, including those from the ruling party.""I am sure it will be passed. There will be many people in the Congress party and in the opposition who will support morality and maintain the moral ground,"" he said.""The Prime Minister himself has included the post of PM in this... Earlier, Indira Gandhi had brought the 39th amendment (of protecting the President, VP, PM, and Speaker from judicial review by Indian courts)...Narendra Modi ji has brought a constitutional amendment against himself that if the Prime Minister goes to jail, he will have to resign,"" Shah added.Currently, the bill has been referred to a JPC for detailed scrutiny, comprising 31 members from both houses of Parliament. The committee will examine the bill and provide recommendations before it is put to vote.","Union home minister Amit Shah asked if it was ""fair for ministers, chief ministers or even the prime minister"" to run the government from jail.

'Talks Are On With...': Rahul’s Wedding Remark After Tejashwi’s Tip Sparks Political Banter In Bihar

Poll Do you believe the government's response to the SSC protests was justified? Yes, they acted appropriately No, it was excessive

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday hit out at the Centre over the alleged lathicharge on Staff Selection Commission (SSC) aspirants and trainers protesting at Delhi’s Ramlila Maidan. He accused the Modi government of ignoring the concerns of the youth, alleging it had come to power by “stealing votes. ”In a post in Hindi on X, Gandhi said the lathicharge on SSC aspirants and teachers peacefully protesting at Ramlila Maidan was “not just shameful, but the hallmark of a cowardly government.”The protest, held on Sunday, saw the participation of several SSC candidates and their trainers, who were demanding transparency and better conduct of recruitment examinations. The SSC exams have faced repeated complaints of abrupt cancellations, server crashes, unresponsive systems and exam centres located as far as 500 kilometres from candidates’ homes.“The youth had only demanded their rights — employment and justice. What did they get? Lathis,” Gandhi said.He alleged that the government first manipulated elections to secure votes, then allowed irregularities in examinations, followed by failures in providing jobs and ultimately sought to suppress citizens’ rights and voices.The Congress leader further said the government does not prioritise the demands of youth, farmers, the poor, Dalits and minorities, as it does not depend on their votes. He urged people not to be afraid but to stand firm and fight back.Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge also condemned the alleged police action, claiming the Modi government had made it a “habit” to jeopardise the future of the youth.“Stealing the future of the country’s youth has become a habit of the Modi government. The brutal lathi-charge by the Modi government’s puppet police on students protesting against rigging in SSC exams at Delhi’s Ramlila Maidan is highly condemnable,” Kharge said in a post on X.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra too criticised the government, calling the use of force on protesting students “inhuman and shameful.”In her post on X, she said, “The youth of the entire country are troubled by rigging in every exam, scams in every recruitment and paper leaks. The corruption in the recruitment process and exams under the BJP rule is ruining the future of the youth.”Denying the allegations, a senior Delhi Police officer said around 1,500 protestors had gathered at the site, and about 100 refused to leave after the permitted time despite repeated requests.“Out of those who were not leaving, 44 protestors were detained. There was no lathi-charge,” the officer clarified.The SSC is a statutory body responsible for conducting recruitment examinations for various posts across ministries, departments and other government organisations.The Phase 13 exam, held between July 24 and August 1 at 194 centres in 142 cities, faced multiple disruptions. Approximately five lakh candidates appeared for the examination during this period.These issues sparked widespread protests across Delhi last week, drawing thousands of aspirants to the streets and triggering a strong backlash on social media.",Rahul Gandhi hits out at the Centre over the alleged lathicharge on Staff Selection Commission (SSC) aspirants and trainers protesting at Delhi’s Ramlila Maidan.
