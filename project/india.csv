"Cabinet counters SC, rejects creamy layer in Dalit quota",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cabinet-counters-sc-rejects-creamy-layer-in-dalit-quota/articleshow/112412751.cms,"Don’t implement SC/ST creamy layer ruling of top court, 100 MPs urge PM

NEW DELHI: Modi govt has rejected the recent Supreme Court ruling asking for exclusion of ‘ creamy layer ’ among Dalits from the purview of quotas, saying that doing so would be unconstitutional.“Recently, the Supreme Court gave a judgment on the issue of reservation. The SC has made some suggestions about SC/ST reservation in it. Today, under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi, wide discussions were held on this issue.And the well-thought-through opinion of the cabinet is that NDA govt is committed and dedicated towards the provisions of the Constitution of Babasaheb Ambedkar And as per provisions of Babasaheb Ambedkar, there is no provision of creamy layer in SC/ST reservation. Cabinet’s decision is that SC/ST reservation should be according to Babasaheb’s Constitution,” I&B minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said in what marked a swift rebuttal of the SC's landmark verdict.Significantly, Modi had signalled his govt's intent hours before the cabinet got down to discuss the issue by telling SC/ST MPs belonging to BJP that the apex court's verdict was only recommendatory and that govt was alive to their “genuine” concerns about it.The top court had held that exclusion of creamy layer, a reference to those whose previous generation had benefited from the SC quota, would help reservation benefits reach the truly disadvantaged instead of being monopolised by better-off sections among Dalits.The Cabinet on Friday asserted that there was no provision for a creamy layer in reservation for SCs and STs in the Constitution given by B R Ambedkar. The decision came in the wake of the recent SC ruling.The Aug 1 SC ruling on creamy layer came from the sole Dalit judge on the bench, Justice B R Gavai, with others — CJI D Y Chandrachud and Justices Vikram Nath, Pankaj Mithal, Manoj Misra and S C Sharma, concurring.However, the idea that the concept of ‘creamy layer’, so far limited to OBCs, needed to be extended to Dalits as well ran afoul of the dominant opinion. Dalit politicians, intellectuals & activists argued that likening OBCs to Dalits was a folly because of differences between the two categories and, also, that advancement in economic status of SCs did not erase the stigma or reduce the discrimination — the principal reason for bringing them under the cover of protective discrimination.“Met a delegation of SC/ST MPs today. Reiterated our commitment and resolve for welfare and empowerment of SC/ST communities,” Modi wrote on X. His remarks also reflected that the govt was looking into concerns expressed by community leaders regarding the apex court ruling.The delegation of more than 100 MPs, including ministers Kiren Rijiju, Sarbananda Sonowal, Arjun Ram Meghwal, Kamlesh Paswan, Birendra Kumar and senior functionaries like Faggan Singh Kulaste called on PM Modi and handed him a memorandum, expressing concern over the SC ruling. They urged that this decision should not be enforced.BJP MP Sikander Kumar said the PM had promised the govt would take MPs’ concerns into account. Kulaste said the PM supported their stance.","PM Narendra Modi had signalled his govt's intent hours before the cabinet got down to discuss the issue.

Dhankhar vs Kharge over Vinesh Phogat

War of words between Dhankhar and Kharge

NEW DELHI: Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar , who has had several run-ins with the opposition leaders during the ongoing Budget session, was at the centre of another fiery faceoff in Rajya Sabha on Friday. An enraged Dhankhar took Jaya Bachchan head on after the Samajwadi Party MP objected to the ""tone"" of Rajya Sabha Chairman against opposition members.The opposition members were seeking an apology from BJP MP Ghanshyam Tiwari over his 'parivarvaad' taunt against Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge made on August 1.""I Jaya Amitabh Bachchan want to say, I am an artist. I understand body language and expressions. Forgive me but your tone is not acceptable. We are colleagues, Sir. You may be sitting in the Chair, and I remember when I went to school ... ,"" the SP MP said triggering a storm.A visibly angry Dhankhar interrupted Jaya's speech and said: ""Enough of it ... You may be anybody, you may be a celebrity, but you have to understand the decorum ... .""""Jayaji, you have earned a great reputation. (But) you know the actor is subject to the director... you have not seen what I have seen from here (the Chair). Every day... I don't want to repeat, I don't want a schooling. I am a person who has gone out of the way ... and you say 'my tone'?"" ""No... no... enough of this. No. You can't have it. No..."" Dhankhar shouted firmly.When an Opposition party member raised objection to how Dhankhar could call Bachchan a celebrity when she was a senior Member of Parliament, the Chairman retorted: ""(Does) a senior member of Parliament has a licence to run down the reputation of the Chair ... to question the tone and tenor?"" Dhankhar then went on to say that he cannot be a party to the House being converted into an ""epicentre of disturbance"".While the opposition accused Dhankhar of being partisan and walked out of the House led by former Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, ruling NDA sought a resolution condemning the “charges” of Jaya Bachchan against Jagdeep Dhankhar.""Today’s incident is highly condemnable. I urge the House to pass a resolution condemning this. The opposition's behaviour has been extremely unparliamentary, undisciplined, and disrespectful. The opposition has become issue-less in terms of discussion, and undignified behaviour has become their habit,"" JP Nadda said.However, the deputy leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Pramod Tiwari, made light of the NDA move and said the censure motion against the opposition is a badge of honour. “The NDA has brought a censure motion against the opposition. It is a badge of honour for us. We will keep fighting for the poor and common people of this country. This censure motion is an award for the entire opposition. We (opposition) will fight this dictatorship and will struggle against the NDA,” Pramod Tiwari said.Tiwari alleged that Jagdeep Dhankhar has not taken any action against Ganshyam Tiwari even after the opposition had given a complaint in writing and added the opposition's voice is being muzzled inside the House.“There are parliamentarians who have an experience of 50 years. However, they are not able to talk and raise the people’s issues as the mic is switched off consistently by the Chairman. Everyone has seen what is being done to Jaya Bachchan. The Chairman does not allow her to speak. She is a veteran and is in Rajya Sabha for the 4 or 5th time,” Tiwari said.Congress MP Ajay Maken said, ""Opposition parties feel the Chairman's approach is partisan. Rajya Sabha is a House that sets parameters for other legislatures. In that House, the Chairman should not be seen as partisan. The Congress alone does not feel that way, all opposition parties feel his behaviour is partial towards one side.""Jaya Bachchan, meanwhile, questioned why Kharge was not allowed to speak by the Chairman.""We are not school children, some of us are senior citizens. I was upset with the tone and especially when leader of opposition stood up to speak, he had switched off the mic. How can you do this? This is against the tradition. You have to allow the leader,"" Jaya told reporters.She also alleged that members sitting in the Treasury benches use unparliamentary words. ""'You are a nuisance', 'Buddhiheen' (stupid), all these words are also spoken by Treasury benches,"" she alleged.The opposition is considering submitting a notice for moving a resolution to remove the Vice-President from his office, news agency PTI said quoting sources. The timing of the notice is to be discussed and decided and though the resolution may not go through it would be a statement to highlight the Chair's ""blatantly and consistently partisan"" approach.According to Article 67(b) of the Constitution, ""Vice-President may be removed from his office by a resolution of the Council of States (Rajya Sabha) passed by a majority of all the then members of the Council and agreed to by the House of the People; but no resolution for the purpose of this clause shall be moved unless at least fourteen days' notice has been given of the intention to move the resolution.""Opposition sources said 87 members have signed on the proposal to initiate action against Dhankhar.A source said around two days ago, leader of house JP Nadda was informally informed that the opposition is considering submitting a motion to remove Dhankhar.On Wednesday, Dhankhar had accused opposition of ""challenging"" the authority of the Chair. This was after Kharge was denied permission to speak on the issue of wrestler Vinesh Phogat, who was disqualified from the Paris Olympics after being found overweight ahead of her 50kg final match.During the discussion on Appropriation (No 2) Bill 2024 and Jammu and Kashmir Appropriation (No 3) Bill, 2024, the opposition members kept sloganeering demanding justice for Phogat but Dhankhar said nothing would go on record.Kharge said he wanted to speak with the Chair's permission on an issue to which Dhankhar responded that he had declined the permission and the debate would continue.Dhankhar said that LoP wanted the Chair to interrupt the debate without taking recourse to any rule and shared his message seeking permission to take the floor without spelling out the issue.After the members walked out, Dhankhar said their act was ""indecorous, undignified, challenging the authority of Chair"".""An LoP, an important fulcrum in Parliamentary democracy ... so painful. I have no words to take exception to such kind of conduct,"" Dhankhar said.In July, during the debate on the motion of thanks on the President’s address, a war of words erupted between Dhankhar and Kharge after the former sarcastically told Congress member Jairam Ramesh to take the latter’s post of LoP. Kharge, who is a Dalit, said Dhankhar was bringing in the “Varna” (caste) system by calling Ramesh “intelligent and gifted”, and by implication labelling him “dull”. An agitated Dhankhar then rapped Kharge for “twisting” his remarks.(With inputs from agencies)","Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar at centre of another fiery faceoff in Rajya Sabha.

The trigger was BJP MP Ghanshyam Tiwari ’s remarks on leader of the opposition Mallikarjun Kharge , leading to an acrimonious exchange between Dhankhar and SP MP Jaya Bachchan .She protested against what she called was the “unacceptable tone” of the Chairman’s remarks and said he was a “colleague” sitting on the chair, after which an infuriated Dhankhar accused the opposition of working to disrupt the House and destabilise the country.Soon, matters had escalated to a wider confrontation between the treasury and opposition benches with the former seeing the disruptions as part of a destabilisation plan and the latter accusing the Chairman of being partisan. Dhankhar argued that Tiwari had only praised Kharge in his remarks but the opposition claimed he was trying to shield the BJP MP.As she stood to make a point in the middle of a heated exchange, Jaya Bachchan said she was an artist and understood body language and expressions. “Forgive me but your tone is not acceptable. We are colleagues, sir. You may be sitting in the chair, and I remember when I went to school...” she said. A visibly angry Jagdeep Dhankhar interrupted her and said he “did not want to be schooled”, repeatedly saying “enough of it”, as he also hit out at opposition.“Jaya ji, you’ve earned a great reputation. You know, an actor is subject to the director. You’ve not seen what I see from here... I don’t want schooling. I am a person who has gone out of the way, and you say my tone...” Dhankhar said, adding, “You may be anybody, you may be a celebrity, you have to understand decorum. Never carry an impression that only you build reputations. We live up to reputations, nothing doing.”When an opposition member objected to Dhankhar calling Bachchan a celebrity when she was a senior MP, the chairman retorted, “Does a senior MP have licence to run down the reputation of the chair... to question the tone and tenor?”Bachchan had, for the last few days, felt annoyed over being called Jaya Amitabh Bachchan. However, Dhankhar, as well as his deputy Harivansh, have pointed out that they are bound by the rule that a member will be identified by the name as it was in official records.As opposition walked out of the House, NDA MPs expressed solidarity with Dhankhar and demanded an apology from Bachchan. Leader of the House J P Nadda condemned the behaviour of opposition MPs and moved a censure motion against Bachchan.Earlier, Dhankhar said, “I know you (opposition) want to destabilise the entire nation. You are out to create chaos in the House. I shall not be party to this House being epicentre of disturbance. You are determined to have your way at the cost of the Constitution. It is a lack of decorum... disrespect to democracy. You are walking away from your obligations.”","Rajya Sabha witnessed an uproar on Friday with NDA and the opposition facing off over Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar.

Mandir-masjid row: ASI says Madhya Pradesh's Vidisha temple is a mosque,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/asi-statement-sparks-mandir-masjid-row/articleshow/112385063.cms,"Hindu groups sought permission to hold puja inside the site on August 9, but ASI cited a 1951 notification classifying it as the 'Bijamandal Mosque.' The permission was denied, causing outrage among Hindu groups.

Vidisha MLA wants survey to prove 'ownership of temple'

BHOPAL: After Bhojshala , a new controversy has emerged in Madhya Pradesh , this time around the ancient Vijay Surya Mandir in MP's Vidisha that is managed by Archaeological Survey of India ( ASI ). Pictures of this temple had gone viral some time ago for its uncanny resemblance to the new Parliament building.For decades, Hindu devotees have observed religious rituals outside the site on Nag Panchami .This year, however, Hindu groups sought permission to enter the premises and hold puja on August 9.District collector Buddesh Vaishya forwarded their request to ASI, which responded by citing a 1951 gazette notification categorizing the site as ' Bijamandal Mosque '. The collector then denied permission for worship, sparking outrage among Hindu groups.They oppose ASI's classification of the site as a mosque, asserting that it has been a place of Hindu worship since 1972.They oppose ASI's classification of the site as a mosque, asserting that it has been a place of Hindu worship since 1972.The Vijay Surya Mandir / Bijamandal mosque site - around 60km from Bhopal and barely 10km from Sanchi Stupa - has had a tumultuous history. The ASI-Bhopal circle website says the mosque was constructed on ruins of a Hindu Temple, and one of the inscriptions found on the pillar says it was a temple of Goddess Charchika.It is believed to have been built in 11th-12th Century to honour Sun God. The temple suffered significant damage during Mughal rule, particularly under Aurangzeb, after which it was repurposed as a mosque in the 17th Century. However, under Maratha rule, the mosque was relocated, and the site fell into disrepair, say locals.In 1934, the discovery of temple ruins sparked a movement, led by Hindu Mahasabha, for its preservation. It had a significant political impact, resulting in the election of Hindu Mahasabha candidates to local offices. Since then, the temple has been opened for worship only once a year, on Nag Panchami.To address communal tensions in 1965, the then chief minister, Dwarka Prasad Mishra, established a separate Idgah for Muslims.With controversy erupting again, Hindu organizations have appealed to PM Narendra Modi to reopen 'Bijamandal Vijay Temple' for regular worship. Collector Buddesh Vaishya told local media everything would be done according to ASI rules. Muslim representatives refrained from speaking to media on controversy.Vidisha BJP MLA Mukesh Tondon has proposed a survey to establish the temple's ownership. This survey, he believes, will confirm the temple's status and potentially lead to ""restoration of its full use for worship"".Tondon acknowledged the Muslim community's stance, noting that they have ""expressed no dispute over the land"". He highlighted the mutual respect between the communities, and cited the district administration's efforts to accommodate Muslim religious practices, particularly on Eid.""The lock placed on the temple by ASI has sparked concerns among Hindus,"" he told reporters, adding that the ASI says the lock is meant to protect some idols that are stored there.""There is no provision for a lock in your rules,"" Tondon said, referencing the legal framework established in 1951 for monument protection. A meeting was held with the district administration to resolve the confusion about the lock, he said, urging ASI to unlock it, especially during the Nag Panchami worship. The MLA intends to raise the issue in assembly and is organizing a team to visit Delhi to meet PM Modi, and minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat.The MLA recounted a similar situation in April 1992, when a protest led to a successful negotiation with ASI and district officials, allowing a team of 11 people to perform puja at the temple. He noted that Hindu families have continued to worship at the site, with no restrictions imposed by ASI. TNN","Hindu groups sought permission to hold puja inside the site on August 9.

"Truth has won, it will impact assembly polls, says AAP",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/truth-has-won-it-will-impact-assembly-polls-says-aap/articleshow/112417163.cms,"Manish Sisodia, accompanied by Sanjay Singh, greets Arvind Kejriwal’s wife, Sunita; Sisodia’s wife is congratulated by family and friends

NEW DELHI: Ecstatic over Supreme Court granting bail to former deputy CM Manish Sisodia in the excise policy case, AAP functionaries on Friday said it was a tight slap on the face of dictatorship of the BJP-led central govt.Within minutes of SC pronouncing the order, AAP functionaries began giving voice to their sense of relief besides accusing BJP-led Centre of carrying out a campaign of hatred against the party.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s wife, Sunita, said on X: ‘Bhagwaan ke ghar der hai, andher nahi’ (there can be delay in getting justice but it cannot be denied). Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann called it a “victory of truth” while AAP Rajya Sabha member Raghav Chadha said Sisodia was in jail for 530 days for providing good education to children. “Today truth has won. In the end, only truth wins,” said a post by “TeamKejriwal” on Delhi CM’s official handle. Kejriwal is in Tihar Jail in the same case.AAP later called a press conference and welcomed the SC order but rued that the relief came after a year's delay.Accusing BJP of indulging in politics of “hatred” and “ill will”, Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh said party leaders werejailed because of a political grudge and Sisodia’s release was a victory of judiciary and democracy. He asked who was answerable for the plight of Sisodia's family and the 17 months he spent in jail.“The prime minister should end the politics of keeping our leaders in jail. No evidence was found againstthem. Kejriwal, Sisodia and Satyendar Jain have been kept in jail by BJP due to ill will,” Singh said.“There is a lot of enthusiasm among AAP workers after Sisodia got bail. Its impact will be felt in the coming elections. We hope CM Kejriwal will also be out of jail soon,"" he added.AAP Delhi state convenerand minister Gopal Rai said the SC’s bail order gave a message that no dictatorship can go on indefinitely. “Sisodia is known as father of the education revolution in Delhi. The penance of the people of Delhi has borne fruits today,” Rai said at the press conference.He added that AAP “regretted” the delay in Sisodiagetting bail. “He should have got it a year ago. CM Arvind Kejriwal and (former minister) Satyendar Jain will also hopefully come out of jail soon,” he said.Minister Saurabh Bharadwaj said the verdict will prove to be a ""milestone"" not only for Sisodia but also for all those politicians in jail against whom there was no proof or witness under Prevention of Money Laundering Act.Inaugurating a school in Dwarka, Delhi education minister Atishi broke down while welcoming the verdict.“They kept him in jail for 17 months on false charges and today he has been granted bail. Today is the day that the man behind the education revolution of Delhi has been granted bail. Today, truth has triumphed and education has won, the children have won,” an emotional Atishi said, adding that Sisodia was sent to jail because he provided good education to children and allocated 25 per cent of the budget to education.","Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s wife, Sunita, said on X: ‘Bhagwaan ke ghar der hai, andher nahi’ (there can be delay in getting justice but it cannot be denied) Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann called it a ‘victory of truth’ while AAP Rajya Sabha member Raghav Chadha said Sisodia was in jail for 530 days.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112417162,imgsize-71284,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/112417162.jpg"
