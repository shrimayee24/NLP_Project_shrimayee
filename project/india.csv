MUMBAI: Nearly three months after the murder of a sarpanch and revelations about his links with the prime accused, NCP minister Dhananjay Munde on Tuesday resigned from the Maharashtra cabinet citing the dictates of his ""conscience"" and ""health"". Sources said the decision followed an ultimatum from CM Devendra Fadnavis in anticipation of a blowback from the opposition.Munde, who had refused to step down saying he had no involvement in the case, was offered the option to quit or face dismissal, said sources. On Monday evening, Fadnavis and deputy CM and NCP chief Ajit Pawar met Munde and demanded that he quit.It coincided with TV channels and websites running visuals - part of the chargesheet in the Santosh Deshmukh murder case - depicting the brutal manner in which the sarpanch was killed by a gang of extortionists.The resignation was announced by the CM during the budget session, but not in the assembly. Later in a statement, Munde said, ""Seeing the photos that surfaced yesterday, my heart is deeply saddened... Keeping in mind my conscience and as my health has not been good... I have resigned.""At Monday's meeting, Fadnavis said that in the larger interest of the state, it would be better if Munde voluntarily quit, said sources. Pawar endorsed the view, saying he too had faced charges of corruption in 2012. He had then resigned and was back in the cabinet following a preliminary inquiry that exonerated him.BJP minister and Dhananjay's cousin Pankaja Munde said, ""I do not have the courage to watch the video... this is an inhuman act. I apologize to Santosh Deshmukh's mother. My brother should have resigned long back.""Dhananjay links to the murder had surfaced when BJP legislator Suresh Dhas spoke at length about the involvement of Walmik Karad, a trusted aide of the minister.","NCP minister Dhananjay Munde resigns from Maharashtra cabinet.

GUWAHATI: Assam health minister Ashok Singhal 's alleged remarks against "" Miyas "" triggered uproar and disruption in Assam assembly Tuesday, with Badruddin Ajmal-led AIUDF seeking a breach of privilege motion against him. AIUDF accused the BJP minister of inciting communal divisions and hatred.In Assam, Miya is a euphemism, used disparagingly to refer to Bengali-speaking immigrant Muslims of Bangladeshi origin - a community of over one crore people, and central to the state's anti-foreigner agitation of the 1980s.The controversy erupted after Singhal allegedly said at a meeting in his constituency - Dhekiajuli, an area with a large population of immigrant Muslims - that Miyas should not be allowed to operate shops during Hindu festivals .Singhal allegedly said he had ""zero support"" for them and urged people to side with him for his cooperation, while discouraging interactions between communities. A video circulating online also shows him saying, ""Don't give it (shops) to Miyas. Give it to our youths. How can Miyas enter our festival? Our boys do not enter in Eid... I am not with them. If you mingle with them, I am not with you.""AIUDF MLA Rafiqul Islam, who attempted to move the privilege motion, accused Singhal of violating his oath by showing bias. ""He cannot continue as minister,"" Islam said, questioning if Singhal would also withdraw doctors from Miya-inhabited areas. However, the Speaker disallowed the motion, stating it didn't meet the criteria.Islam warned that Singhal's comments could lead to discrimination against the community in government schemes.","Assam health minister Ashok Singhal's alleged remarks against "" Miyas "" triggered uproar and disruption in Assam assembly Tuesday.

SDPI chief Faizy sent to ED custody,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sdpi-chief-faizy-sent-to-ed-custody/articleshow/118718629.cms,"ED

NEW DELHI/KOZHIKODE: A Delhi court on Tuesday sent SDPI national president M K Faizy to the custody of Enforcement Directorate (ED) for six days in an alleged money laundering case in connecion with the proscribed Popular Front of India (PFI).Additional sessions judge Chander Jit Singh sent Faizy to custody on the plea of ED seeking his interrogation to unearth the money trail in the case and conspiracy. The Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI), founded in 2009 and headquartered in Delhi, is alleged to be the political front of the now-banned PFI.The accused opposed the application, saying the funds were transferred before the PFI was declared unlawful. Faizy, according to the sources, was held on March 3 night from the Delhi international airport under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The ED has alleged SDPI to be the ""political front"" of PFI, which was banned by the Centre in Sept 2022 for being an ""unlawful association"". The SDPI, however, denies any such link and calls itself an independent outfit.Meanwhile, SDPI activists took out a protest march in Kozhikode against Faizy's arrest. Party national vice-president Mohammed Shefi said in a statement that the arrest of Faizy was part of retaliatory politics by the BJP govt at the Centre aimed at suppressing political opponents.","Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI), founded in 2009 and headquartered in Delhi, is alleged to be the political front of the now-banned PFI.

MUMBAI: Soon after food and civil supplies minister Dhananjay Munde resigned on Tuesday morning, the issue of Samajwadi Party MLA Abu Asim Azmi's remarks eulogising Mughal emperor Aurangzeb rocked both Houses of the Maharashtra legislature , resulting in proceedings being called off for the day.While BJP and Shiv Sena demanded that Azmi be suspended and charged with treason, opposition said the issue was raked up by the governing parties to divert attention from Munde's exit.Outside, Wagle Estate police and Naupada police in Thane registered FIRs against Azmi for hurting religious sentiments and defamation under the BNS, even as the MLA from Mankhurd-Shivaji Nagar issued a statement saying his remarks in context of the film 'Chhava', which depicts the conflict between Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj and Aurangzeb, have been misrepresented. ""Regarding Aurangzeb, I have only stated what historians and writers have mentioned. I have not made any derogatory comments about Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj , Sambhaji Maharaj, or any other great personalities. Wrong history is being shown (in film). However, if my statements have hurt anyone, I retract my words and statements.""He added: ""This issue is being turned into a political matter, and I believe that closing the assembly's budget session because of this is a disservice to the people of Maharashtra."" Later, in a clip circulated by his office, he said he had no intention to insult anyone, including Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj, Dr B R Ambedkar or Mahatma Jyotiba Phule. ""I have huge respect for them...,"" he said.On Monday, during an interview, Azmi reportedly said Aurangzeb should not be viewed simply as a cruel ruler, but rather as a great administrator who also built temples. He had also said that during Aurangzeb's reign, India's border reached Afghanistan and Burma (now Myanmar). ""Also, I do not believe that the battle between Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj and Aurangzeb was not about religion; it was a political battle.""Deputy CM and Shiv Sena chief Eknath Shinde said, ""Azmi is a traitor and has no right to sit in the assembly. He has always been insulting Chhatrapati Shivaji and Sambhaji Maharaj."" Sena (UBT)'s Aaditya Thackeray said: ""Whenever BJP is in trouble, it takes Azmi's help. He's their puppet. He must be suspended. But former governor BS Koshyari also insulted our icons, so action must be taken against him too...""",Abu Asim Azmi's remarks eulogising Mughal emperor Aurangzeb rocked Maharashtra legislature.

NASHIK: Seven men allegedly stalked and harassed a Union minister's minor daughter and her friends during a visit to a village fair in Maharashtra's Jalgaon last Friday, brushing aside the constable escorting the girls when he demanded to check their mobile phones to confirm they hadn't secretly recorded videos.One of the suspects was detained Sunday after police registered an FIR against all 7 men under Pocso Act and sections 75(1) (sexual harassment), 78(2) (stalking), 79 (outraging a woman's modesty), & 189(2) (unlawful assembly) of BNS.""We are looking for the remaining suspects.

One can only imagine what would have happened to other girls. I am pressing for strict action against culprits,"" he said.Opposition latched onto the case as a reflection of 'deteriorating law and order in state under Mahayuti government, wondering how ordinary people can feel safe if criminals were able to harass a Union minister's daughter and her friends despite the presence of a police escort.NCP (SP) MP Supriya Sule urged CM Devendra Fadnavis to review law and order and assure people that they would be safe: ""Every girl who lives in the state is a daughter of Maharashtra.
