‘Snubbed’ Sita Soren lays claim on Shibu Soren legacy & seat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/snubbed-sita-lays-claim-on-soren-legacy-seat/articleshow/110480119.cms,"DUMKA: A sleepy town in the tribal heartland of Santhal Pargana , Dumka first drew everybody’s attention in Oct 1990 when Lalu Prasad Yadav , the then CM of undivided Bihar, placed BJP leader L K Advani under arrest at a Bihar govt guest house in Massanjore at the site of a dam on the banks of the Mayurakshi after halting his Ram Rath Yatra in Samastipur.Around the same time, JMM patriarch Shibu Soren had just been re-elected to Parliament from Dumka, a reserved seat for tribals, and was spearheading a movement against Lalu’s govt for a separate state of Jharkhand comprising tribal-dominated areas of south Bihar.Cut to May 2024, Hemant and Tejashwi, sons of Shibu and Lalu respectively, have joined hands as INDIA bloc partners to take on BJP in the ongoing Lok Sabha polls.However, the alliance suffered a setback just three days after the Lok Sabha polls were announced when Sita Soren , Shibu’s eldest bahu, abandoned ship and crossed over to BJP.Sita also resigned as the JMM MLA from the Jama seat. Soon after, BJP announced her candidature from the Dumka seat recalling its earlier nominee, sitting MP Sunil Soren, who had defeated Shibu in the 2019 general election by nearly 50,000 votes. Sita has been quite vocal in criticising her late husband’s family and JMM.Campaigning in Dumka, which will vote on June 1, has been hectic. Sita has been holding door-to-door campaigns and conducting public meetings in the villages.Addressing the crowds, mostly poor tribal men, women, and children, in Santhali, she said: “The Jharkhand that you see today is a result of Guru ji (Shibu) and the vision of the late PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Even though Modiji built Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, like in Ramayana, this Sita was sent to vanvas (exile) for 14 years by her own family after the death of her husband.”Dumka is known as a JMM bastion. Party president Shibu has won the seat eight times since 1980 and lost four times (1984, 1998, 1999 and 2019). Although considered an impregnable fortress, BJP has breached it several times in the past, the last being in 2019 when Sunil beat Shibu.Now, with former chief minister Hemant Soren behind bars since Jan 31 after his arrest in a land scam case, Shibu’s pocket borough faces threat from his own daughter in-law. Two months after her “devar” (younger brother-in law) was arrested, Sita switched to BJP citing continuous neglect by the Soren family.In her public discourse, Sita has often said, “Hemant has not seen struggles in his life. It was baba (Shibu) and my husband (Durga) who fought for a separate state and endured hardship. All he knows is kursi (chair) and AC (airconditioner). A member of the family (referring to Kalpana Soren) is going around the state giving slogans like ‘Jail ka tala tutega, Hemant Soren chhutega’. How does she intend to break the lock? Can anyone arrest a CM, who is the most powerful person in a state, without evidence?”Sita’s late husband Durga was groomed by Shibu as his political successor. With Durga’s sudden death in 2009, Hemant, the third among Shi bu’s four children, was thrust into the political arena.“I had no intention of joining politics. I wanted to become an architect but had to drop out (of BIT Mesra) as the central agencies were harassing my family. Then, I wanted to be a businessman, but bhaiya’s death and father’s illness changed everything,” Hemant had told TOI in an interview in 2019.Sita was elected MLA from Jama, Durga’s old constituency, thrice (2009, 2014 and 2019) but was not inducted into the cabinet by Hemant even though he was the chief minister twice (2013-14 and 2019-2024). The 52-year-old was even ignored when Champai, a Shibu loyalist, took oath in Feb this year following Hemant’s arrest. Basant, a first-time MLA (from Dumka) and Shibu’s youngest son, was made transport minister.Interestingly, there were rumours that Sita switched to BJP following pressure to do so. With Supreme Court ruling in March this year that MPs and MLAs were not immune to prosecution for accepting bribes for votes or making a speech in the House in a particular fashion, it became clear that Sita, who is facing a horse-trading case in a CBI court in Ranchi, would face trial.Dismissing the rumours, Sita, claimed, “The case has been going on for many years now. Had that been the reason, I would have been in BJP much earlier. I joined BJP because I was not being respected in my party.”For BJP, which is fighting Lok Sabha elections in Jharkhand on the corruption plank (with focus on the arrest of Hemant, Congress minister Alamgir Alam and senior IAS officers in separate money laundering and illegal mining cases), Sita’s attacks could further dent the JMM-led INDIA bloc’s image in the tribal heartland of Santhal Pargana division, where JMM and Congress won 16 out of 18 seats in the 2019 assembly polls.On the law and order front, Dumka doesn’t have a good record with news of crimes, particularly against women and children, often hitting headlines.A Spanish woman who was on a global bike tour with her husband was gang-raped in Dumka. It was also where a Class 12 student was set on fire by her stalker and his accomplice while she was asleep. She died of burn injuries days later, in Aug 2022. BJP, which has been accusing the JMM-led coalition govt of turning a blind eye to illegal immigration from Bangladesh, had then accused the govt of appeasing minorities.“In Dumka, Shibu is respected across party lines. BJP does not speak ill of him, given his political stature and popularity among the tribals,” said Ramesh Mandal, a BJP worker from Nala in Jamtara district. “Yes, it is true that Sita broke away from the family, but BJP supporters do not look at the candidate. They only look at the symbol and PM Modi,” he added.Nalin Soren, a seven-time JMM MLA and Sita’s opponent, calls her “bahu”. “She is my daughter-in-law, too. I haven’t spoken to her since she left JMM but until the polls are over, she is my opponent. She talks about neglect, but it was the family that made her MLA thrice from Jama after her husband’s death. It was the party that made her win, not her charisma,” he added.",JMM patriarch Shibu Soren's daughter-in-law Sita Soren has joined hands with BJP. Sita has been quite vocal in criticising her late husband’s family and JMM. She has been holding door-to-door campaigns and conducting public meetings in villages.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110480137,imgsize-1235377,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/110480137.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Claiming that the country is under dictatorship, AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal accused Union home minister Amit Shah of threatening to topple the Bhagwant Mann government in Punjab after the Lok Sabha polls. This comes after Shah, at a poll rally in Ludhiana, asked people to ensure the BJP's victory in Punjab and said, ""the Bhagwant Mann government will not last long after the BJP's victory.""Referencing Shah's statement while addressing a gathering of traders in Amritsar, Kejriwal said, ""He gave a threat. He issued a threat that after June 4, the Punjab government will be toppled. Bhagwant Mann will no longer remain the chief minister after June 4.""Kejriwal questioned the possibility of toppling the government, saying, ""We have 92 seats (MLAs). How can you topple (government)? There is a dictatorship (in the country).""He alleged that BJP leaders were openly saying they would threaten the legislators with the CBI and the ED and then ""buy"" them and added, ""Do not threaten the people of Punjab. Otherwise, they will make it difficult for you to enter Punjab.""During an interaction in Bathinda, Kejriwal asked Shah to explain what ""conspiracy"" has been hatched to topple the AAP government in Punjab. He said, ""Such language was never used by any home minister,"" and alleged that Shah had openly threatened the people of Punjab.He asked, ""What plan do you have to topple the government? Will you scare the people of Punjab with ED and CBI? Or will you impose president's rule?"" and claimed the BJP wants to end the free electricity facility in Punjab and urged people to give 13 seats to the AAP for the continuation of free electricity.Criticising the Narendra Modi government, Kejriwal highlighted it has done no work in the last 10 years to show to the people.Responding to Shah's remarks, Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann, said, ""Do you have the courage to topple the government? We have 92 seats. They are threatening us. Are you coming (here) to seek votes or threaten to topple the government?"" Mann questioned Shah's threat, saying, ""What do you think of us? Do you think we are for sale? Such a threat will not work. Punjabis are angry over this.""Mann accused the BJP of playing politics of hatred and polarization and said that the AAP was seeking votes in Punjab based on the work done by his government in the last two years. He noted that the prime minister is unable to talk about building schools and giving jobs, which is why he is only speaking about 'mangalsutra', 'meat', and 'Pakistan.'Mann criticized the BJP for terming his request for an extension of interim bail for medical tests as a ""drama.""Speaking on seeking extension of bail, Kejriwal said, ""They earnestly wish that Kejriwal die. If anybody loses seven kg in one month without any apparent reason, then it is a serious problem. Doctors have prescribed many tests. I sought only one week for tests. Unexplained weight loss is a serious thing.""Kejriwal was arrested in a money laundering case linked to the alleged Delhi excise policy scam in March and is currently out on interim bail till June 1.","AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal accused Union home minister Amit Shah of threatening to topple the Bhagwant Mann government in Punjab after the Lok Sabha polls.

The 2024 polling percentages were however lower in Jammu region as compared to 2019, showing a slight dip of 0.3 percentage points for Jammu and 1.9 percentage points for Udhampur.As regards Kashmir Valley, three parliamentary constituencies - Srinagar, Baramulla and Anantnag-Rajouri - recorded the highest combined turnout of 50.9% in three decades. Data shared by the EC on Monday put the 2019 combined turnout figure for the three Valley seats at a mere 19.2%, which is 30 percentage points lower than 2024. The comparison may however not be perfect as the geographical limits of Anantnag had undergone some significant changes during delimitation in 2020-21, with parts of Jammu division's Rajouri district added to it.EC on Monday termed the high turnout in J&K a testament to robust democratic spirit and civil engagement of its people. ""The voter turnout of 50.86% from the three seats in Kashmir Valley echoes the faith of the people in the democratic process,"" it said in a statement.Chief commissioner Rajiv Kumar, while thanking the voters of J&K, stated: ""This achievement sits on a credible wave of 25% increase in the number of contesting candidates since 2019, C-vigil complaints showing enhnaced citizen involvement and Suvidha portal showing 2,455 requests for rallies etc, reflecting the steady retaking of the election and campaign space away from hesitation and to fuller particpation"".EC sought to attribute the high turnout by the younger voters in the age group 18-39 years. This particular age category accounted for 56% of the electorate in Baramulla, 48.6% in Srinagar, 54.4% in Anantnag-Rajouri and 47.7% in Jammu.Also, 26 special polling stations - including 21 in Jammu, 4 in Delhi, and 1 at Udhampur - were set up to facilitate voting by displaced Kashmiri migrants.Recounting EC's efforts to boost voter participation in J&K, the poll body said adventure sports, symposiums, awareness rallies, nukkad natak and numerous other events were organised to propagate the message of voting.

PUNE: Two doctors of Pune's state-run Sassoon General Hospital - forensic sciences head Dr Ajay Taware and casualty medical officer Shrihari Halnor - were arrested Monday along with a mortuary staffer on charges of swapping blood samples to shield the teenager who fatally hit two techies on a motorbike on May 19 while driving a Porsche allegedly after a night of pubbing.Investigators said the trio allegedly acted at the behest of the 17-year-old's father, a Pune builder, after the latter approached them through a middleman to manipulate the lab tests to check for alcohol in the boy's bloodstream.A magisterial court remanded Taware, Halnor, and mortuary employee Atul Ghatkamble in police custody till May 30.The arrests happened after police received the underage driver's blood reports from Sassoon Hospital and an Aundh-based facility, both negative for alcohol. Investigators also received reports of the boy and his father's DNA from forensic sciences laboratory, Pune police commissioner Amitesh Kumar said.""The minor's first blood sample was collected at 11am on May 19 (eight-and-a-half hours after the accident) at Sassoon Hospital. The second was collected at the Aundh hospital around 7 pm to rule out possibility of manipulation such as replacement of blood samples,"" he said.Both these samples were sent for DNA fingerprinting to FSL. The DNA fingerprinting of the minor’s father was done at FSL after his arrest last Tuesday in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar,” the police chief said.The DNA of father and son matched in the Aundh hospital’s sample, he said. “However, it did not match at Sassoon. This prompted us to investigate the matter.” Pune police commissioner Amitesh Kumar said, “We have added sections 120-B, 213, 214 and 467of IPC to the charges.” The investigation revealed that after the accident, the builder hired an unidentified middleman to get in touch with Ghatkamble. The latter helped the builder contact Taware around 10am on May 19, Kumar said.The builder’s phone, seized from his bungalow, showed that he made a regular call to Taware and later used an application to make 20 more calls.Halnor, the police chief said, admitted during his questioning that he received Rs 3 lakh from Taware. It was Halnor who allegedly threw the boy’s blood sample into a dustbin and replaced it with that of someone else. “We are verifying the identity of the person whose sample was used. Also, we are examining Ghatkamble’s mobile phone to identify the middleman.”On Sunday evening, crime branch officials picked up Taware from his residence and Halnor from the hospital. They were arrested at 5 am on Monday. Ghatkamble was arrested on Monday afternoon.Halnor gave a clean chit to the teenager on May 19 after conducting a physical examination, Kumar pointed out.A senior police officer said the builder, who is in judicial custody in another case under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act for allegedly handing over the car to his minor son despite knowing that the latter did not possess a driving licence, will soon be arrested in the first case. Police invoked sections 304, 304-A, 279, 337 and 338 and 427 of IPC against the driver.“The incident is very serious.

They claimed six villagers, including a 15-year-old boy, were injured, and that police rounded up 50 villagers, some of whom were arrested.Police denied the charges and said those killed in Pidiya were Maoists , many of whom carried bounties. CM Vishnu Deo Sai has backed the security forces, praising them for the encounter.

Hit by heat? Delhi turnout drops to 10-year low,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/hit-by-heat-delhi-turnout-drops-to-10-year-low/articleshow/110427766.cms?pcode=462,"Voting loses steam as temp rises

NEW DELHI: Intense heat, extended weekend, and general indifference seem to have caused a drop of close to 4.5 percentage points in voter turnout in the capital for the parliamentary elections on Saturday. The city was electing seven members of the Lok Sabha after intense campaigning by BJP, AAP, and Congress, the latter two having struck an alliance.According to Election Commission's voter turnout app at 10pm, 56 per cent of over 1.5 crore eligible voters cast their votes in the capital. In 2019, the turnout had been recorded at 60.6 per cent and in 2014, it was 65.1 per cent, indicating a sharp drop in voter engagement despite strenuous efforts by EC, civil society groups and RWAs to encourage people to exercise their franchise.EC officials, however, added that the turnout figures were still undergoing revision and the final number would emerge later.Though 162 candidates are in the fray, the fight is largely between BJP, which is looking at a hat-trick with a clean sweep, and the AAP-Congress combine, which fought its first election together after making a pre-poll seat-sharing arrangement.North East Delhi parliamentary constituency, which has witnessed an interesting electoral battle between BJP's sitting MP Manoj Tiwari and Congress' Kanhaiya Kumar, recorded the highest voting percentage of approximately 60.8 per cent in the capital. The lowest voter turnout of 52 per cent was recorded in New Delhi constituency, which is home to politicians, bureaucrats and judges and has a number of upscale residential pockets. It also houses many govt employees. Here, BJP's Bansuri Swaraj is contesting against AAP's Somnath Bharti.At 10pm, the voter turnout in West Delhi was recorded at 57.8 per cent ; in Chandni Chowk 58.1 per cent ; in East Delhi 54.8 per cent ; in South Delhi 53.9 per cent ; and in North West Delhi 53.8 per cent .A senior official at the office of chief electoral officer of Delhi said voting was continuing in a few polling booths in North East Delhi and North West Delhi till 7.30pm, much beyond the cut-off time of 6pm.""We should wait till the time the final voter turnout is known to make an analysis,"" said an official from the office of the chief electoral officer of Delhi. ""Getting the data from some polling stations takes time and this does not include postal ballots,"" the official added.Polling had started at a brisk speed in the morning with the sun yet to glare down at the capital. There were queues at several polling booths across the city. But as the day progressed to noon and then late afternoon, the crowds dwindled. Queues began to form again in the evening before the closing time of 6pm.While there were some reports of EVM and VVPAT machines developing snags in some booths, officials claimed these were minor hiccups. CPI (M) functionary Brinda Karat, however, alleged she had to wait for almost an hour to cast her vote as the battery of the EVM control unit at her polling booth at St Columba's School in the New Delhi constituency ""drained out"". Poll officials, however, said it was replaced.Delhi ministers Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj also complained about alleged irregularities. Atishi allegedthat irregularities were committed by presiding officers in Janakpuri and Kalkaji.Both BJP and AAP-Congress alliance have a lot at stake in this election. While BJP is looking at asserting its political dominance by winning all seven Delhi seats, as it has done in the two Lok Sabha elections in the immediate past, Congress, with the help of AAP, is trying to reclaim a foothold in the city politics. AAP is looking to have a larger say in national politics by sending its functionaries to Lok Sabha.Under the seat-sharing arrangement, AAP has fielded candidates on four seats – New Delhi, South Delhi, West Delhi and East Delhi – while Congress is contesting three – North East Delhi, Chandni Chowk and North West Delhi.","According to Election Commission's voter turnout app at 10pm, 56 per cent of over 1.5 crore eligible voters cast their votes in the capital.

"Rishi Sunak sees 78 Tory MPs exit ahead of July poll, surpassing 1997 exodus before Tony Blair's win",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/rishi-sunak-sees-78-tory-mps-exit-ahead-of-july-poll-surpassing-1997-exodus-before-tony-blairs-win/articleshow/110445174.cms,"Britain's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak (AFP photo)

There were tears, anger and frustration as many Conservative lawmakers digested their PM Rishi Sunak 's decision to call the UK elections on July 4, much earlier than they had ever expected.

Some of those fighting to retain their seats feared the six weeks left to convince skeptical voters to back them would not be enough. For others planning to stand down, it meant an abrupt end to their political careers , forced to clear out their offices months earlier than planned.Trailing Labour by over 20 percentage points in polls, Sunak, analysts said, is betting that the Tories can cut their losses by facing the voters.

But a grassroots Conservative campaign coordinator said that the morale was the lowest he had known in five decades. Tory members of parliament seem to share this sense of futility: 78 of them have opted not to contest their seats, an exodus that includes Michael Gove, who once vied for party's top post and has been at the heart of nearly every Conservative-led govt since David Cameron's in 2010. Other high profile figures who have announced they will not seek re-election include former PM Theresa May, Northern Ireland minister Chris Heaton- Harris, ex-armed forces minister James Heappey and ex-defence minister Ben Wallace.

The number of Tories exiting is more than the previous post-1945 high of 72 who quit prior to Tony Blair's 1997 landslide win for Labour, which is expected to triumph again. The departures add to a feeling that the Conservatives are on track to be kicked out of power after 14 years, although Labour require a big swing to secure a majority. Sunak's decision to go to the polls early has triggered fears that he's leading the party to one or more ""Portillo"" moments - when a Tory big beast loses a safe seat in an election whitewash - named for the time cabinet minister Michael Portillo lost in Enfield Southgate in 1997.

NEW DELHI: British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has taken the 'unusual step' of spending a day away from public events on the first Saturday of the election campaign to strategise with his closest advisers and family, ahead of the upcoming polls on July 4, PTI reported.This comes amidst a significant number of senior Conservative Party members, including Cabinet ministers Michael Gove and Andrea Leadsom, announcing their decision not to stand for re-election in the upcoming polls.In his letter, Gove acknowledged the challenges of political office and expressed his belief that it was time for a new generation to lead. ""After careful reflection, I have decided not to stand as a candidate in the forthcoming election,"" wrote Leadsom in released a letter to Sunak.Despite claims that Sunak was hoping to reset his campaign, sources clarified that he was spending the day campaigning in his north England constituency of Yorkshire. Conservative minister Bim Afolami dismissed criticisms of the Sunak campaign made by the Opposition, emphasizing the importance of framing the election correctly.Theresa May, who previously served as the prime minister, is one of the prominent members of parliament deciding to step down from their positions. This announcement comes after Ben Wallace, the former defence minister, had already made public his intention to withdraw from frontline politics.During a visit to the Titanic Quarter in Belfast on Friday, Sunak faced a reporter's question about whether he was ""captaining a sinking ship"" heading into the election. Meanwhile, Opposition Labour leader Keir Starmer is focusing on public events to argue that the Conservatives have damaged the economy and increased living costs.A recent YouGov opinion poll conducted after Sunak called the snap summer general election showed Labour's lead falling by three points, with the Conservatives up by one point to 22 percent and Labour down two to 44 percent.","British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has taken the 'unusual step' of spending a day away from public events on the first Saturday of the election campaign.
