When Love Turns Lethal: Inside India’s Honeymoon Murders | The Silent Crisis No One Talks About

Poll Should the woman face legal consequences for her actions in this case? Yes, she should be held accountable. No, she is a victim of circumstances.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday turned the tables on a married woman, who sought cancellation of anticipatory bail to a man accused of raping her on promise of marriage, by warning her she might be liable for prosecution for having a physical relationship with a man other than her husband during subsistence of her marriage.When the woman's counsel argued that the man had continued to engage in a sexual relationship with his client on the false promise of marriage, a bench of Justices M M Sundresh and N Kotiswar Singh said, ""You are a married woman with two children. You are a mature person, and you understand the relationship you were getting into outside the marriage.""When the advocate said that she was called many times to hotels and rest houses by the man for sex on the pretext of marriage, the bench asked, ""Why did you go to the hotels repeatedly at his beckoning? You very well understand that you also have committed an offence by having a sexual relationship outside the marriage.""The bench said Patna high court was right in granting anticipatory bail to Ankit Barnwal and dismissed the plea of the woman. The trial court had refused anticipatory bail to Barnwal, who had sought relief after the woman registered a rape complaint against him.Also Read: Man arrested for raping minor sister in law The married woman and Barnwal had been in a relationship after knowing each other through social media in 2016.

Calcutta HC acquits three on death row for 2014 murder,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/calcutta-hc-acquits-three-on-death-row-for-2014-murder/articleshow/122702397.cms,"Calcutta high court

No proof that any of 3 accused was near crime spot: HC

KOLKATA: Three persons awarded death sentence for a murder and incarcerated for the past 11 years were acquitted on Thursday by Calcutta high court, which ruled that the prosecution had failed to conclusively establish their hand in the killing of a 28-year-old woman, whose mutilated body was found at Sealdah railway station in 2014.A division bench of justices Debangsu Basak and Md Shabbar Rashidi held that there was no evidence whatsoever to associate the three accused — the woman’s husband and two others — with the murder.Their presence at the scene of crime at the relevant time has not been proved convincingly, Calcutta HC held. On the morning of May 20, 2014, chopped body parts of Jayanti Deb were found in the parking area of Sealdah station, some wrapped in a quilt and some stuffed into a trolley bag. Investigating the case, Govt Railway Police arrested her estranged husband Surojit Deb, his girlfriend Lipika Poddar and one Sanjoy Biswas. Surojit and Lipika were accused of committing the murder and hiring Sanjoy to dispose of the body.Charges were framed against the three on April 21, 2015. In 2019, a Sealdah court found them guilty of murder, destruction of evidence and criminal conspiracy, and sentenced them to death.The high court bench overturned the verdict. The HC observed that there was “overwhelming evidence” that Surojit had moved out of his marital home with his daughter much before the crime, and was living elsewhere with Lipika. There was absolutely no evidence that any of the three accused was in the vicinity of the crime spot around the date of the incident, the court said, acquitting all three. “The prosecution had hopelessly failed to bring home the charges levelled against the appellants at the trial, beyond all reasonable doubts sufficient enough to secure their conviction,” the bench stated.The trial court order was based on Sanjoy’s ‘confession’, which he later retracted.","Jayanti Deb's mutilated body was found at Sealdah railway station in 2014.

ED’s action part of political witch hunt: Vadra’s office

NEW DELHI: A day after attaching his properties worth Rs 37 crore, the ED on Thursday filed a chargesheet against Robert Vadra, son-in-law of former Congress president Sonia Gandhi , in a Rouse Avenue court here accusing him of laundering “proceeds of crime” in a Gurgaon land deal worth over Rs 58 crore.Besides Vadra, ED has accused 11 others in its chargesheet against the businessman, husband of MP Priyanka Gandhi. The other accused include Onkareshwar Properties and promoters/directors Satyanand Yajee & K S Virk, sources said.The Rouse Avenue court in Delhi is yet to take cognisance of the ED chargesheet against Robert Vadra. This is the second chargesheet filed against the Gandhi family in less than three months. The ED had filed a chargesheet against Sonia and Rahul Gandhi on April 17 in the National Herald money laundering case.Reacting to the ED chargesheet, Vadra’s office said the “present proceedings are nothing more than an extension of the political witch hunt by the present govt”, adding that he would defend and clear his name in court. “As a law-abiding citizen, Vadra has always and will continue to extend his fullest cooperation to the authorities and he is confident that at the end of it all, he will be cleared of any wrongdoing,” the statement said.Vadra is facing multiple money laundering cases for several land deals he negotiated under the then Congress govts in Haryana and Rajasthan, and for alleged favours he had received from the then Congress govt in Haryana led by then CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda . The Hooda-led Congress govt had allowed changes in land use from agricultural to commercial/residential for properties acquired by Vadra, leading to alleged windfall gains for him. Vadra is also facing a money laundering investigation in a case filed against fugitive arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari. He has been accused of allegedly acquiring properties through Bhandari in London and Dubai from the proceeds of crime from multiple defence deals.In the present case in which chargesheet has been filed, Vadra has been accused of purchasing 3.5 acres in Shikohpur village in Gurgaon’s Sector 83 through his Skylight Hospitality Pvt Ltd from Onkareshwar Properties Pvt Ltd on Feb 12, 2008, for Rs 7.5 crore. The then Congress govt in Haryana immediately gave him a commercial licence to develop the property over 2.7 acres. Four months later, the same land was sold to DLF for Rs 58 crore, making a profit of Rs 50 crore within months of purchasing it.ED’s money laundering probe is based on an FIR registered by Gurgaon police in 2018, alleging fraudulent transactions in the land deal. The ED on Wednesday attached 43 properties worth over Rs 37 crore associated with Vadra and his entities, including Skylight Hospitality Pvt Ltd.","ED files chargesheet against Robert Vadra, son-in-law of former Congress president Sonia Gandhi.

BELAGAVI: Police officer Narayan Baramani , against whom chief minister Siddaramaiah allegedly made a slap gesture and who made headlines for seeking voluntary retirement (VRS) because of the incident, has been posted as deputy commissioner of police (law and order) of Belagavi city.Baramani, previously additional SP, Dharwad district, submitted his VRS papers earlier this month although the controversial incident occurred in April during a Congress rally in Belagavi. Siddaramaiah, reportedly frustrated by a disruption caused by BJP women activists, had summoned Baramani to the rostrum and had gestured as if to slap him but held himself back.In a video, Baramani, citing “humiliation, personal dignity and professional respect”, had sought VRS. The video garnered widespread public and media attention. However, after discussions with both Siddaramaiah and home minister G Parameshwara, Baramani decided to continue in service.His recent transfer to Belagavi as DCP is seen in administrative circles as a compensatory move, possibly in recognition of the public embarrassment he faced during the rally.Baramani is no stranger to Belagavi. Over his 31-year career in the police force, he served some seven to eight years at Belagavi in various capacities, including as circle inspector of Market Police Station and assistant commissioner. He is especially remembered for his effective handling of the 2014 unrest following the court-mandated removal of the ‘Yallur in Maharashtra’ signboard — a sensitive issue in the region.With four years left for his offcial retirement, Baramani’s return to Belagavi is viewed with interest, esepcially by citizens who recall his decisive leadership during tense times.",Narayan Baramani has been posted as deputy commissioner of police (law and order) of Belagavi city.
