A city court is hearing a related case in which former RG Kar principal Sandip Ghosh and former local Tala OC Abhijit Mandal had been arrested, but were later granted bail because CBI filed no chargesheets against them within the statutory 90-day period.Sources said the cops summoned now were mostly manning RG Kar's police outpost, while some were at the local Tala police station on Aug 9 and Aug 10 last year. The trainee doctor was raped and killed on Aug 9, following which massives protests by doctors and citizens erupted in the city.CBI has questioned several Kolkata cops earlier, including senior officers who were part of an SIT that probed the crime before the central agency was handed the case by the high court. Several of these officers had deposed in court in the just-concluded trial.The victim's parents have, however, been vocal about alleged CBI lapses, from lack of cooperation to shoddy probe.","CBI has summoned 11 Kolkata cops for questioning on Monday and Tuesday in connection with its probe into criminal conspiracy and destruction of evidence in the RG Kar rape-and-murder case.

This is aimed at helping BJP get more votes.""""These names don't tally with the list of permanent residents of a constituency and are aimed at helping the ruling party at the Centre.
