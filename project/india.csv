MUMBAI: In the 2019 polls, Maharashtra , which sends the second highest number of MPs to the Lok Sabha in the country, played a key role in PM Modi's victory with the BJP-Shiv Sena alliance winning 41 of the state's 48 seats. But in Verdict 2024, the state has delivered a major blow to the NDA . The opposition-led Maha Vikas Aghadi dominated the state with leads or victories in 30 seats, leaving the BJP-led Mahayuti alliance trailing far behind with leads or wins in just 17 seats. Vishal Patil, the Congress rebel who won from Sangli as an independent, is also expected to add to MVA's numbers.This is the outcome despite the BJP-triggered split of two regional parties-Shiv Sena and NCP-with the aim of fracturing the opposition and raising its own numbers. Instead, this consolidated the opposition vote, with Congress being the biggest beneficiary. Congress replaced BJP as the single largest party in the state with leads or victories in 13 seats. This was a dramatic turnaround from its historic low of winning just one seat in 2019.Responding to the results, Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray said the INDIA bloc should stake claim to form the govt at the Centre. ""We will be meeting tomorrow (Wednesday) to discuss this. It's not as if BJP has not harassed Nitish Kumar and Chandrababu Naidu who are currently with NDA.""Within Mahayuti, BJP's tally plunged from 23 seats in 2019 to leads or wins in just 9 seats. Shinde's Sena led or won in 7 seats and Ajit Pawar's NCP had to settle for a single seat. Union ministers including Raosaheb Danve (Jalna) and Bharti Pawar (Dindori) were routed and state minister Sudhir Mungantiwar lost from Chandrapur.Within the MVA, Thackeray's Shiv Sena (UBT) bagged or led in 9 seats and NCP (SP) led in or won 8 seats. Both parties won more seats than the parties that split from them. In Baramati, the most keenly watched contest in the state,Sharad Pawar 's daughter Supriya Suledefeated Ajit Pawar's wife, Sunetra Pawar.Observers said it's clear that Mahayuti's strategy of relying on PM Modi's appeal did not deliver results. On the contrary, 'Operation Lotus' boomeranged and generated sympathy for Thackeray and Sharad Pawar. Indeed, allying with Ajit Pawar who BJP had strongly targeted during the irrigation scam may have upset the party's core voters.Also, Modi's statements about appeasement of Muslims during his Lok Sabha poll campaign, his reference to Sharad Pawar as ""bhatakti aatma (wandering soul)"" and Shiv Sena (UBT) as ""nakli Sena"" seem to have backfired.Price rise, unemployment, agrarian distress and the opposition's message that the Constitution would be changed to scrap the SC quota if Modi came back to office were among the macro factors that impacted the results. The Maratha agitation similarly cost the Mahayuti, especially in its epicentre, Marathwada.Experts said the consolidation of Muslim and Dalit votes helped the MVA. ""The youth face unemployment, farmers are upset with Centre's policies and these sections went against Mahayuti. Muslims and Dalits consolidated in favour of the MVA,"" said an NCP functionary.The Lok Sabha results will have implications for the state assembly polls which are six months away.How did the two Senas perform? The Shiv Sena UBT led in 9 seats, just two more than Shinde's Shiv Sena. However, it had also contested 21 seats compared to Shinde's 15. Thackeray's strike rate for victory was 43% compared to Shinde's 47%. But Thackeray dominated in Mumbai, winning two seats compared to one claimed by Shinde in the three contests between the parties in the city. However, in the Thane region, Shinde's party wrested both the seats it contested against Sena (UBT).In the Konkan belt which has been a stronghold of the Thackeray family, Sena (UBT) lost both seats. Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg was claimed by Uddhav Thackeray's bete-noire, former CM Narayan Rane. This is the first time BJP has won a seat in the Konkan region.Within the NCP factions, Sharad Pawar's party dominated with leads in 8 seats and a victory in its citadel, Baramati. Ajit Pawar had to console himself with a single victory in Raigad for sitting MP Sunil Tatkare. Pawar Sr had contested 10 seats and had a strike rate of 80%. Ajit Pawar's party contested 4 seats and had a strike rate of 25%.Congress contested 17 seats and led in 13, leading to a strike rate of 76%. ""MVA allies worked together and supported each other, down to booth level. This is what worked for us,"" said Congress's Prithviraj Chavan.Meanwhile, BJP which won 9 of 28 seats contested, had a strike rate of 32%. It suffered a major setback in the Vidarbha region from where deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis hails, as its tally fell from 5 seats in 2019 to just 2.The party did not win a single seat in Marathwada, the heart of the Maratha quota agitation, which has also been impacted by a fierce drought.BJP's numbers also declined in its bastion North Maharashtra where the Centre's export quota ban on onions, the main crop in the region, became a poll issue. Its seats here fell from 3 to 1. BJP's tally also fell from 4 to 1 in Western Maharashtra and 3 to 1 in Mumbai.Responding to the verdict, Thackeray said, ""This is a victory of democracy. The PM should have held more rallies. The BJP lost in locations where he campaigned.""Fadnavis tweeted, ""The unfortunate outcome of the results is that the opposition attempted to win the seats through its propaganda that we would change the Constitution. But in elections, the people's mandate has to be accepted as it is.""",Maha sends the second highest number of MPs to the Lok Sabha in the country.

Congress Party: Congress needs strong strategy to revive fortunes in Delhi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-needs-strong-strategy-to-revive-fortunes-in-delhi/articleshow/110714638.cms,"Lok Sabha Elections Assembly Elections Party View Alliance View Majority: 272 543 543 Seats: 543 Results NDA WON NDA 293 INDIA 234 OTH 16 View MapView Details Source: Pvalue

NEW DELHI: The Congress party 's hopes of regaining lost ground in the national capital were tied to the Lok Sabha , as they have been unable to win the Vidhan Sabha for a decade and the corporation for 17 years. However, the party failed to secure any seats in Delhi for the third consecutive time, this time in an alliance with AAP this time.While Kanhaiya Kumar lost North East Delhi seat to Manoj Tiwari, Udit Raj was defeated by Yogendra Chandolia (North West). JP Aggarwal failed to best Praveen Khandelwal in Chandni Chowk.This defeat marks a significant blow for Congress, which had traditionally dominated Delhi's political scene, often sweeping all the seats in previous Lok Sabha elections prior to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s era at the Centre.Several factors contributed to the party’s campaign struggles, including the late announcement of candidates compared to AAP and BJP, the defection of state president Arvinder Singh Lovely to BJP just weeks before the polls and the inability to motivate cadres and unite different factions within the party. The lack of a strong grassroots structure and the absence of charismatic leaders also hindered the party's chances.“In such elections where there are only two blocks (BJP and INDI alliance), the contest becomes close. Had we managed these issues, then we could have dented BJP in some seats,” said a senior Congress functionary. The vote percentage difference between Congress and BJP candidates was around 9% in the closely contested Chandni Chowk and North East Delhi constituencies.However, Congress functionary Abhishek Dutt emphasised the party's good performance in several seats, which he believes could serve as a model for the party to revive its fortunes in Delhi. “We have done well in several states and have stopped BJP from the magic number of 272. This was possible because we raised issues that affect the common people, such as unemployment and price rise… youths are upset with the way their jobs are being snatched in the name of schemes like Agniveer,” he said.Dutt expressed optimism in using the same model in Delhi to bring back the party's glory days. “We will do a sustained campaign in Delhi like we did in Telangana and Karnataka,” he said.Senior party members, meanwhile, cautioned that if Congress didn’t take decisive action, it might encounter even greater difficulties in the upcoming Vidhan Sabha polls in Feb next year. They stressed the importance of the party reassessing its strategy, bringing in fresh leadership and launching campaigns focused on issues directly impacting the lives of the people.Party functionaries expect that the upcoming Vidhan Sabha polls will likely see BJP, AAP and Congress fighting independently.","The Congress party failed to secure any seats in Delhi for the third consecutive time, this time in an alliance with AAP this time.

He has seen it all — from a student leader to chief minister to kingmaker of central govts to being pushed into political wilderness and even to jail in an alleged corruption case. But the latest victory in Andhra Pradesh must be the most satisfying for N Chandrababu Naidu , 74, the tech-savvy ‘CEO’ in along time.After winning the 2019 assembly polls, YS Jagan Mohan Reddy and his YSRCP cadres tried to relegate Naidu to merely a Kamma community leader by attracting other communities with welfare schemes. But in the past year, Naidu not only managed to break free of the shackles, he also stitched together an alliance with BJP and actor Pawan Kalyan’s Jana Sena — a consolidated caste bloc against YSRCP.While Naidu will prefer to be the Andhra CM, he would once again don his old robe of a kingmaker at Centre with his 16 Lok Sabha seats. He lost the role of a mover and shaker of central govts in 2004, after the UPA came to power and Y S Rajasekhara Reddy helmed a Congress win in united AP. YSR and his welfare politics pushed Naidu into oblivion for two terms until he regained power in 2014.Just like former president Pranab Mukherjee, considered by some to be the ‘best prime minister India never had’, Naidu is one of the best techsavvy PMs India never had. Mukherjee aspired to be PM, but Naidu declined it in 1996.Naidu was the convener of United Front (1996-98) and NDA (1999-2004). He was the most influential regional party leader back then. He played akey role in choosing the PM candidates and presidents during coalition govts.With AP having bifurcated and left with only 25 MP seats (42 before), and BJP forming govt at Centre on its own post 2014, Naidu could not dictate terms to the Union govt as in the past. His vision for a greenfield world class capital city for AP in Amaravati to compete with Hyderabad could not fructify. As a result,TDP lost the 2019 polls and had just three MPs and 23 MLAs.Naidu had revolted against NT Rama Rao over the latter’s second wife Lakshmi Parvati’s increasing influence in TDP affairs. Many MLAs backed the move and elected Naidu as their leader. After the successful intraparty coup, Naidu became the youngest CM of united AP at 45 and won bouquets and brickbats. The concepts of good governance by integrating technology stood as a role model for many states and at national level. He is often considered as one of the pioneers of IT in India on the administrative side by bringing industry-friendly policies. Hyderabad has developed into an IT hub and the most attractive destination for investments after his policies changed its face.He faced backlash from voters as his policies did not benefit them directly. As new CM, he will have two challenges — find ways to generate revenues to fund the numerous welfare schemes that Jagan started during his term, together worth around Rs 2.7 lakh crore. He has promised to enhance the amounts on all schemes and add new ones. He will also have to raise resources and encourage investors to return to Amaravati.","N Chandrababu Naidu, 74, is the tech-savvy ‘CEO’ in along time.

BHOPAL: BJP may have suffered a bruising in UP, Maharashtra and Rajasthan, but the party has 29 reasons to celebrate in MP, the original saffron heartland.BJP’s slogan of “400 paar” had fizzled out by noon on Tuesday, but in MP the call for 29-0 was ringing out loud and clear. Even Congress ’ last bastion, Chhindwara, fell. MP has never proven its loyalty to BJP more emphatically. The victory margins said it all — the least was nearly 52,500 (Morena) and the highest was a record 11.7 lakh (Indore).Indore made another record — 2.18 lakh votes for NOTA. “No choice” turned out to be Indore’s second choice, making up 14% of votes cast.For CM Mohan Yadav, propelled from the backbenches to the state’s top post, the clean sweep comes as a morale booster. He will take all 29 newly elected party MPs to Delhi early Wednesday morning.While BJP workers celebrated across MP, there was silence in Congress offices. Never before has Congress been reduced to zero in MP. Its second-rung leaders were routed in the Nov 2023 assembly elections, and now the top leadership has been decimated. Digvijaya Singh, who didn’t want to contest the 2024 , suffered his second consecutive LS defeat — Bhopal in 2019 and Rajgarh in 2024. Nakul Nath lost Chhindwara, placing the Nath family political legacy at risk. Rumours in Feb of the Naths’ possible switch to BJP — rumours that the father and son took their time denying — seem to have cost them dearly. Former Union minister and Congress’ trib al face Kantilal Bhuria lost by over 2 lakh votes to BJP newcomer Anita Nagar Singh Chouhan.“Thank you Chhindwara,” CM Yadav tweeted.Nath and Digvijaya — Congress’ Jai and Veeru — are not riding into a glorious sunset.It was a different story for BJP’s stalwarts. From Shivraj Singh Chouhan to Jyotiraditya Scindia and VD Sharma, they won by massive margins.Chouhan, who was denied a fifth term as CM, won by over 8.2 lakh votes, proving that “Mama” is still BJP’s tallest leader in MP. After such an emphatic win, the BJP brass can longer ignore him. But a Union ministry berth may not be enough for BJP’s longest serving CM, who is a six-time MP and former state party chief.Union minister Jyotiraditya Scindia has made a comeback in Guna, his family seat, which he had lost to a former aide, KP Yadav, in 2019. BJP denied a ticket to Yadav and Scindia won by over 5.4 lakh votes, the highest ever on this seat. With this victory, he has strengthened his clout in the party he joined four years ago.For Congress, it’s a soulshattering defeat. Its new state chief, Jitu Patwari, will be walking the razor’s edge. MP sticks out as a sore thumb on a day Congress was celebrating elsewhere.","Even Congress’ last bastion, Chhindwara, fell. The victory margins said it all.

RAIPUR: Chhattisgarh has never disappointed BJP in Lok Sabha elections . It stood by it yet again on Saturday when the saffron camp was looking for numbers.While neighbouring MP handed over all 29 seats to BJP, the saffron camp looked headed for victory in 10 of the 11 seats in Chhattisgarh at 9pm, Korba being the lone Congress victory.BJP has always dominated in parliamentary polls in Chhattisgarh, winning 10 seats each in 2004, 2009 and 2014, and nine in 2019. Now, it’s back to 10.Chhattisgarh is a healing win for BJP after setbacks in Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan, and also puts first-time chief minister Vishnu Deo Sai on a stronger footing. After unseating Congress in the assembly elections in Nov last year, the thumping Lok Sabha election results indicate that Sai, the state’s first tribal CM, has succeeded in consolidating BJP’s position and his own stature in the party.Building on the momentum of the 2023 assembly polls, BJP won Naxal-hit Bastar and Kanker. In Bastar, BJP’s Mahesh Kashyap defeated former Congress minister Kawasi Lakhma by over 55,000 votes. Kanker went down to the wire and BJP scraped through by 1,884 votes.BJP’s win in Bastar division is significant because it comes in the wake of the most sustained anti-Maoist offensive in two decades — 118 Maoists have been eliminated in just five months.Former Congress CM Bhupesh Baghel, too, had to bite the dust in Rajnandgaon. He was trailing by over 44,400 votes against BJP sitting MP Santosh Pandey. On Monday, the eve of results, Baghel had alleged discrepancies in serial numbers of EVMs in Rajnandgaon, saying the numbers given by EC before voting didn’t match with those on Form 17C.In Raipur, minister Brijmohan Agrawal had an unassailable lead of over 5.2 lakh votes, and in Durg BJP sitting MP Vijay Baghel was leading his Congress rival by 4.2 lakh votes.CM Sai thanked BJP workers for putting up a winning show. He admitted that NDA didn’t meet expectations in some states but pointed out that it did exceptionally well in Odisha and Andhra Pradesh. “Once again we are going to form govt under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” he said.“Modi guarantee has resonated across the country. Beneficial schemes of the state and Centre have had a positive impact. Certainly, better results will be achieved in the future,” he said.State Congress president Deepak Baij acknowledged that the election results in Chhattisgarh did not meet their expectations but drew solace from INDIA bloc’s strong show elsewhere.","Chhattisgarh is a healing win for BJP after setbacks in Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan.

New realities may make Modi tweak game but not faze him

NEW DELHI: Narendra Modi is set to take over as PM for the third time in a row, but suffered a setback as an unexpectedly strong show by Congress, Samajwadi Party and Trinamool Congress denied him a Lok Sabha majority.The drop of 60-plus seats was caused by losses inflicted by Akhilesh Yadav 's SP in the saffron stronghold of UP, which had played a crucial role in Modi's previous two victories; smart teamwork by Congress, Uddhav Thackeray and Sharad Pawar in Maharashtra; and Mamata Banerjee's successful defence of her Bengal bastion. BJP managed to dodge a debacle because of its victory in Odisha, the sweep of Andhra Pradesh by its ally TDP and by saving its strongholds of Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh from being breached. It also performed well in Assam, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and, along with ally JD(U), retained its dominance in Bihar.The failure to secure an absolute majority and the resultant return of coalition politics dampened celebrations of Modi's success in becoming the first PM to secure three consecutive terms since Jawaharlal Nehru in 1962. BJP's score of 241, while distinctly underwhelming when viewed through the prism of the previous two single-party majorities and the 400+ target Modi had set for himself, is still a creditable performance for a govt facing 10-year incumbency.The loss of majority leaves BJP dependent on allies — both bigger like TDP (16) and JD-U (12) as well as smaller ones like Chirag Paswan's LJP. All three promptly pledged support to Modi.But both Chandrababu Naidu and Nitish Kumar are known for their transactional outlook and maximalist approach. The lurking possibility of them using their leverage, encouraged further by feelers from Congress and others in the opposition, is going to be a constant worry for BJP.The new realities of coalition politics will mark a sharp change from the first two terms, when BJP’s own numbers cushioned it from pulls and pressures from NDA partners.In any case, the party will be faced with a ‘difficult’ Lok Sabha because of the jump in opposition’s numbers and the new-found bounce in their step.In their post-verdict comments, Rahul Gandhi and Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge loudly proclaimed their intent by claiming that PM Narendra Modi had suffered a moral defeat and needed to quit. Akhilesh, who played the caste card with precision, Mamata, Uddhav and Pawar will be more than ready to supplement Congress’ aggression.The changed complexion of the Lok Sabha, the return of coalition govt in the real sense of the term, and the revival of caste factor in Uttar Pradesh and pockets of Rajasthan and Haryana mark the return of politics that was the norm until Modi’s two consecutive landslides.All these may be constraints for Modi, requiring him to calibrate his game, but may not necessarily faze him. In his address to party workers, he reiterated that his new term will be one of “historic decisions”.“This is Modi’s guarantee,” he stressed while signaling the likelihood of steps particularly aimed at women, the poor, Dalits and tribals.His statement that the year marks the 350th anniversary of the coronation of Chhatrapati Shivaji also struck many as significant.The shrinking gap with the opposition in a contest largely perceived to be stacked in the incumbent’s favour was largely because of the performance of SP-Congress combine in Uttar Pradesh. The two partners managed to expand their support beyond the ‘MY’ constituency to build a larger coalition that also included a significant number of non-Yadav backwards. They also managed to lure in large sections of Dalits, feeling disappointed with Mayawati, by successfully painting BJP’s 400+ target as an anti-quota plot.As a result, election in vast swathes of the state, which accounts for 80 Lok Sabha seats got localised with caste prevailing over BJP’s larger themes of nationalism, Hindutva and development.But the result also brought out Modi’s resilience. BJP swept diverse geographies — from MP and Delhi to Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh — and posted impressive victories in Chhattisgarh, Assam and Jharkhand.The Modi factor’s pull was also manifest in the breakthrough in Kerala with BJP candidate Suresh Gopi recording the party’s first-ever LS victory in the state, which has all along seen bipolar contests between Congress and Left. Despite the loss of seats, BJP retained its dominance in Rajasthan and, along with JD(U), in Bihar.But the results underscore the strongest challenge that Modi has had to face since he moved to the Centre in 2014. The opposition’s resolve to reduce him to a ‘normal’ PM and his response should make for an intense duel. Society, economy and polity will all feel the impact.","Narendra Modi is set to take over as PM for the third time in a row, but suffered a setback as an unexpectedly strong show by Congress, Samajwadi Party and Trinamool Congress denied him a Lok Sabha majority.

Gains for BJP: It will lead third NDA government

Gains for NDA allies: They will have more say in governance

But why is the opposition celebrating?

Gains for Congress: After 10 years of isolation, it has finally scripted a revival and will have a respectable position in opposition ranks

Gains for INDIA parties: Regional parties will have a greater say in Parliament after defeating BJP in its bastions

NEW DELHI: Those active in stock market understand how failure to meet expectations can be disastrous despite good results. We got a glimpse of that today also as Sensex tanked over 4,000 points on failed expectations and investors lost lakhs of crores. Well, that perhaps explains the political mood after the 2024 Lok Sabha election results sprang some surprises. The BJP-led National Democratic Alliance has been voted back for a historic third term. But the overriding feeling in the ruling camp is of defeat. On the other hand, the INDIA bloc is way behind the half-way mark of 272 and yet the feeling in the opposition camp is of victory.Well, this feeling of despondency has a lot to do with BJP's stupendous performance in the last two elections and the resultant expectations the supporters had from the party. In 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections , the BJP had won simple majority on its own winning 288 and 303 seats respectively. Its dependence on allies in the last ten years was a mere formality. But that has now changed. The BJP is now dependent on its allies to form NDA 3.0 and will now have to take them along in the process of decision making.It all started with Prime Minister's ambitious poll pitch of ""abki baar 400 paar"" which set the bar very high for the BJP. The idea perhaps was to mobilise BJP voters and party cadres for another big performance. All along the campaign, the BJP leaders reinforced the theme of ""400-paar"" raising the expectations of party's supporters. Then came the exit polls. Almost all the pollsters predicted a massive BJP win and at least three of them claimed that PM Modi 's 400-paar pitch would turn into a reality on June 4 when the votes are counted. This rising crescendo led to very high expectations from the saffron party - which was shattered to some extent by the results today.However, PM Modi in his victory speech tried to boost the morale of workers and supporters by calling today's victory a historic feat. He mocked the INDIA bloc for failing to come even close to the BJP numbers despite all of them uniting together.And while the BJP gears up for NDA 3.0, it is a reality that the saffron party will have to depend on new allies TDP and JD(U) to form and sustain the new government.Now, coming to the opposition camp. The INDIA bloc score is at 232. This is 40 less than the half-way mark of 272. But the spirit in the opposition camp is high. The opposition alliance was almost written off by many, thanks to the many contradictions within. The bickerings and ideological differences between disparate parties that surfaced from time to time added to the negative perception of the alliance. To sum it up, INDIA bloc was seen as an opportunistic alliance which had come together just for power.The exit poll results added to the feeling of failure with only one pollster giving the opposition alliance an outside chance of 200 seats. All others had predicted only around 150 seats for the alliance. The INDIA bloc leaders had rejected the exit polls and had exuded confidence of a good show. But, given the past track record, there were no takers for their claims. So, when the results trickled in today, there was a lot to cheer in the opposition camp. For once their performance had improved. The Congress made surprising gains almost doubling its tally from 2019. The Samajwadi Party emerged as the biggest winner handing over a shock defeat to the BJP in its bastion of Uttar Pradesh. Mamata Banerjee surprised the BJP regaining the ground she had lost in 2019. Clearly, there were several positives for the opposition to feel upbeat. And that explains why they were feeling upbeat even in their defeat.","The BJP-led National Democratic Alliance has been voted back for a historic third term.

NEW DELHI: Shrugging off celebrations in the opposition camp over BJP’s loss of majority, PM Narendra Modi on Tuesday declared that his third term will be defined by bold decisions , signalled the likelihood of fresh initiatives specifically aimed at women, the poor and SCs/STs and declared his intent to press on with his drive against corruption.“All Indians will walk together and make the country progress... the third term will be used to write new chapters of bold decisions and it is a guarantee of Modi,” the PM said in his address to BJP cadres who had gathered to applaud the verdict that will lead to the third consecutive Modi-led regime.If he was feeling disappointed over the results, Modi did not show it. Nor was there any indication that the reduced numbers would act as a restraint on him as the PM asserted that his drive against corruption would continue.“If the country has to progress in the 21st century, then we will have to wage a war against corruption . Digital India and technology have given wings to containing corruption, but this fight is becoming difficult. Glorifying the corrupt with extreme shamelessness is giving strength to them. However, the third term of NDA will be utilised to eradicate corruption in all forms,” he said, an assertion which appeared significant in view of opposition’s aggressive denunciation of alleged misuse of central probe agencies.The trademark assertiveness extended to his digs at Congress and the praise of Election Commission for “showing the mirror” to those who doubted the integrity of polls.Modi said the Lok Sabha polls were a victory of democracy and a reflection of people’s unflinching faith in the country’s Constitution and gave a boost to the pledge to make India a developed nation.Hailing the EC, its officials and security personnel, the PM said 140 Indians should be proud of the credibility of the country’s election process. “I exhort people of the country, influencers, opinion makers that they should make the whole world aware of the country’s electoral process, as it has given a new identity to the country,” he said, an apparent response to opposition parties’ continuous attack on the poll panel.The PM said NDA’s win was the victory of the world’s largest democracy, of unwavering loyalty to the Constitution, of the pledge of a developed India, of the mantra of ‘Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas’, of 140 crore Indians.Taking a swipe at opposition parties amid their celebrations over NDA’s reduced victory margin, Modi said, “Our opponents together could not win as many seats as BJP alone has won in this Lok Sabha election.”Stating that it was an emotional moment for him, Modi said, “This was my first election after my mother passed away but believe me, millions of mothers, sisters and daughters of the country never let me feel the absence of my mother. Wherever I went across the country, mothers, sisters and daughters gave me unprecedented love and blessings.”The PM said 10 years ago, the country gave a mandate for change as that was the time when the country had sunk to the depths of despair. “We were blessed with terms like ‘fragile five’, newspaper headlines were filled with scandals every day, and the country’s young generation became apprehensive about their future. Then the country entrusted us with the task of extracting pearls of hope from the deep ocean of despair. We all tried and worked with full sincerity. In 2019, expressing faith in this effort, the country again gave a massive mandate. After this, the second term of NDA became a guarantee of development and legacy,” he said.Modi further said, “In 2024, with this guarantee, we went to every corner of the country to seek people’s blessings. Today, I bow down with humility to the blessings that NDA has received for the third time.”He once again assured that the next tenure would be an era of women-led development with more focus on emancipation of youth, farmers and a campaign on a war footing to wipe out poverty, making it a thing of the past.","PM Narendra Modi on Tuesday declared that his third term will be defined by bold decisions.

NEW DELHI: Even though the BJP is leading on around 240 seats, much less than the 303 seats it won in 2019 , its vote share has seen only a marginal dip, meaning it has been unable to convert its vote share into seats this time.In 2019, the BJP had secured around 37.36% of the total votes, this time trends show that the saffron party may see a vote share of 36.59% -- a possible decrease of 0.77 percentage points.The marginal decrease in vote share however has translated into the BJP losing as many as 63 seats.This is partly due to the fact that the party has lost a lot of seats in UP and Hindi heartland states due to the seat-sharing arrangement by the INDIA bloc despite polling figures similar to the 2019 polls.It has also made several inroads in the southern states but was not able to secure any seats despite raising their voter percentage in the south.It is a completely different story for the Congress , which seems set to corner 21.22% of the vote share -- an improvement of nearly 1.73 percentage points compared to the 19.49% it registered in the 2019 polls.The slight increase in vote share has, however, allowed the Congress to nearly double its tally compared to 2019, when it won just 52 seats. As per latest trends, the Congress is set to win 99 seats.","In 2019, the BJP had secured around 37.36% of the total votes, this time trends show that the saffron party may see a vote share of 36.59% -- a possible decrease of 0.77 percentage points.

One of the fundamental rules of quantum mechanics states that reality doesn’t exist in a definitive state independent of observation. This doesn't claim that reality happens because of mere observation, it just means that observation reveals a version of reality that is unique to the observer. It’s a lesson that pollsters, politicians, journalists, and anyone who is in the business of keeping track of votes in a democracy out to remember, to hold one's horse till the fat lady sings.Therefore, it’s always important to wait till the end of the match to see the real nature of perceived reality (a phrase coined by the venerable TOI columnist Jug Suraiya) as opposed to their imagined reality.Elections aren’t fought on paper, and one shouldn’t jump the gun beforehand nor should they assume that the voter has already made his or her choice. These shockers are reminders of why one ought to wait for one’s analysis till the fat lady sings.If there’s one man who can be considered the MVP of the election, it has to be the Chandrababu Naidu who will be patting himself on the back for a series of wise decisions. Jailed by the YS Jagan Mohan Reddy government in the skill development scam case, he was released on October 31, 2024. Eight months later, he is perhaps the most important ally for BJP in the NDA, who are crossing the majority mark thanks to their alliance with TDP. Naidu played a pivotal part in stitching an alliance with Pawan Kalyan’s Jana Sena and BJP. As part of the seat-sharing deal of the NDA partners, TDP was allocated 144 assembly seats and 17 Lok Sabha constituencies, while the BJP contested six Lok Sabha and 10 assembly seats. Jana Sena meanwhile contested two Lok Sabha and 21 assembly seats. In the Andhra assembly election, the TDP-led alliance is leading in 160 of the 175 seats. In the Lok Sabha, the alliance is leading in 21 of the 25 seats, making Naidu, who was part of the UPA alliance in 2019, one of the BJP’s most important allies right now.For two elections in a row, it seemed like that the BJP was unsurmountable in Uttar Pradesh. The received wisdom was that BJP would match their 2019 count, if not better thanks to the Ram Mandir inauguration. The final numbers suggest that it's neck and neck between BJP and SP.Akhilesh’s SP, the cornerstone of the INDI alliance in Uttar Pradesh is currently leading in 35 seats with the Congress leading in 7. The leitmotif of Indian politics has always stated that the road to Delhi is through Uttar Pradesh and NDA-3’s journey was certainly made more tumultuous by Akhilesh Yadav and SP. During the 2017 Assembly Elections, the unofficial anthem of the Congress-SP alliance was “UP ke ladke” and it might have taken six years for the it to materialise, but it looks like it finally did. If things hold, they might even better their performance from 2004.Maharashtra politics just hasn’t been the same since 2019, when Uddhav Thackeray and the Shiv Sena split with the BJP to join the MVA. It was the biggest breakup since The Beatles with major political upheavals. Since then, Uddhav Thackeray has built his own personal brand which is quite antithetical to his father's fire-and-brimstone personality, with many praising his calm handling of the Covid-19 crisis in Maharashtra. However, the MVA government fell when Anand Dighe's one-time protege Ekanath Shinde split the Sena, ultimately getting control of the party symbol as well.It was a big blow for Uddhav Thackeray, a party synonymous with his father. However, as far as voters are concerned, it would appear that Uddhav Thackeray is the true inheritor of Shiv Sena’s legacy. At the time of writing, the MVA’s three parties are leading in 28 of the 48 seats and whatever the final count all eyes will be on Uddhav Thackeray when the Maharashtra assembly elections come around next year.Throughout his career, Nitish Kumar has made it a habit of switching alliances, living up to the weathervane tag that was reserved for his buddy from the JP days: Ram Vilas Paswan. Before the elections, Nitish Kumar flipped the script once again after he left the INDIA bloc despite being one of its founding members. As the final numbers stand, JD(U) along with the TDP, might turn out to be BJP’s crucial allies going forward. The 14 seats that the JD(U) are leading in will prove absolutely crucial to the NDA getting a third-term majority. At an event with PM Modi in Patna, Nitish Kumar had promised the Prime Minister Modi that he won’t undergo a change of heart yet again. This had elicited a guttural laugh from the Prime Minister, who will certainly hope that his frequent frenemy doesn’t have another change of heart in the near future.For a long time, Rahul Gandhi, the de-facto leader of the Indian National Congress has been under-fire, often treated as an object of ridicule, someone who couldn’t do anything right. Everything he said was mocked. But, to quote the only man to win the Nobel, Oscar, Grammy and Pulitzer, the times are a changin'. Two long Bharat Jodo yatras, 107 public outreach programmes and a superlative effort by the Gandhi scion will see Congress give their best performance in 10 years.The INC is expected to hove near the 100 seats, which might not be as high as the numbers that were there under his great-grandfather, grandmother, father or mother, but it’s certainly an improvement and a promise to the BJP that winning elections are going to get tougher.A lot of column space – proverbial and literal – was spent on Rahul Gandhi’s decision to contest from Rae Bareli instead of his traditional seat of Amethi. Congress General Secretary Jairam Ramesh had called Gandhi a “seasoned player of politics and chess” and had said that the move was made after “careful consideration”. Instead, Gandhi family’s trusted lieutenant Kishori Lal Sharma was picked to contest from the seat and he’s currently ahead by a margin of 82,000 plus votes against Irani. Five years ago, Irani had shocked everyone by beating Rahul Gandhi in the Gandhi family bastion. It looks like, if the votes hold, that the Congress has managed to wrest back its family bastion.In 2012, Arvind Kejriwal emerged as one of most covered figures in Indian politics. The oxygen of publicity was for various reasons including the party's presence in Delhi and savvy social media usage. However, for one of the country's fastest growing parties, Kejriwal will surely be disappointed with the party's final tally. For starters, AAP’s performance is dismal in Delhi where they had a seat-sharing pact with Congress and BJP looks set to win all seven seats. In Punjab, the AAP is only leading in three seats, a shallow return considering the fact that it recently won the Assembly elections in the state handsomely. The party had promised to change politics when it was formed, but 12 years after its inception, the party’s roar certainly seems stronger than its bite and has to make-do being a bit-part player in the scheme of national politics.Over the last few weeks, JD(S)’ Prajwal Revanna, who also happens to be former PM Deve Gowda’s grandson and sitting Hassan MP from Lok Sabha. Revanna left the country on April 26, even as the hundreds of videos allegedly involving him went viral. He is currently facing charges of multiple instances of sexual abuse by various women and is SIT custody. Many had wondered if a man who was accused of such heinous allegations ought to be a people's representative but the election result makes that particular debate moot. At the time of writing, Prajwal Revanna is losing by nearly 40,000 votes .If Chandrababu Naidu is one of the MVPs of the election, then Jagan Mohan Reddy is one of its biggest losers. Reddy has been under-fire for Andhra Pradesh’s poor financial health as the state grapples with a massive debt of Rs 13.5 lakh crore for his welfare schemes. Sources suggest that voters were frustrated by several issues including poor infrastructure, lack of drinking water, a fluctuating power, ginormous electricity bills, and huge prices of essential commodities. With the benefit of retrospect, backward policies have also backfired with his attempt to woo Muslims with 4% reservation and similar benefits to the Kapu community alienated voters. His decision to drop 14 sitting MPs and 37 MLAs from the candidate list also prompted an exodus from the party. His decision to imprison his rival Chandrababu Naidu also triggered a sympathy wave and even allowed Pawan Kalyan to forge an alliance that was perfect for the BJP. At time of writing, YSRCP is only leading in 13 assembly seats and four Lok Sabha seats, a dismal performance compared to their score last time around (151 in assembly and 22 in Lok Sabha).And finally, the biggest loser of the 2024 Lok Sabha election was without a shred of doubt, the Exit Polls which has as much credibility as the parrots that sometimes turn up on TV stations to predict elections. Most exit polls had given BJP a comfortable lead over 350 with an average of 371 of most meaningful pollsters. Reality suggests that they still haven’t crossed the 300. The problem is known to most who understand basic maths, particularly in a first-past-the-post-system which is often based on vote share that can vacillate wildly while extrapolating. A prime example is the 2014 Lok Sabha Election Result where BJP’s vote shares only increased by 12.2PP but their seat count increased by 166. Similarly, INC’s vote share decreased by 9.24PP that led to 162 fewer seats.The Opposition had labelled the polls, Modi’s Polls. While the Opposition didn’t garner the required seats, the numbers were so off that some pollsters were spotted shedding tears on live television. Getting back to our original quantum mechanics trope, it's impossible to predict whether a cat is dead or alive until a box is opened. And it's hazardous to do so based on exit polls.","Chandrababu Naidu is perhaps the most important ally for BJP in the NDA, who are crossing the majority mark thanks to their alliance with TDP.

NEW DELHI: As the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) faces the possibility of falling short of a majority on its own in the Lok Sabha, its ally Telugu Desam Party ( TDP ) has firmly pledged its support to the National Democratic Alliance ( NDA ), putting to rest any speculation of a shift towards the INDIA bloc . The Election Commission's data until 7 pm indicates a challenging scenario for the BJP , having secured 89 seats and leading in 150 more. This suggests that the party's final tally might be around 240 seats, well below the 272 required for a majority, spotlighting every alliance.The TDP is poised to secure 16 out of the 25 Lok Sabha seats in Andhra Pradesh. Kanakamedala Ravindrakumar, a senior leader of the TDP, told the news agency PTI, ""Our pre-poll pact with the BJP and Janasena in Andhra Pradesh isn't just political arithmetic; it's a matter of credibility."" He categorically stated, ""We will remain part of the NDA. There is absolutely no question of supporting the India bloc.""This assertion from the TDP comes at a crucial juncture when regional parties are being courted by both the NDA and INDIA bloc and the BJP depends on N Chandrabau Naidu and Nitish Kumar to form the government. The Congress party has already promised to grant special category status to Andhra Pradesh, a long-standing demand of the TDP, if the INDIA bloc comes to power. However, the TDP's declaration carries significant weight, considering its history in coalition politics and its past fallout with the BJP just before the 2019 elections, despite being a long-time ally.Ravindrakumar, referring to this legacy, stated, ""Chandrababu Naiduji's imprint on national coalitions is indelible. Today, as then, his maneuvers will be guided by Andhra's aspirations. Our NDA alignment is a conduit for the state's progress."" The Naidu-led NDA alliance in Andhra Pradesh is also on the verge of a landslide victory in the state elections, set to unseat the YSRC led by Jaganmohan Reddy.The TDP's strategy is evident—leveraging its national alliance for the benefit of the region. With Andhra Pradesh's development heavily reliant on central support, the party is inclined to continue its association with the NDA. A TDP insider, hinting at long-term political calculations, stated, ""Our bond with the NDA isn't transactional. It's a shared vision for India, where Andhra's resurgence is integral.""As the final chapters of the election unfold, the TDP's stance serves as a stark reminder that regional dynamics often shape the national political landscape in India's diverse political arena.

NEW DELHI: The verdict is out. The Bharatiya Janata Party-led NDA is set to form the government at the Centre for the third consecutive term. But what would usually be termed a clear victory, in turn, feels like a defeat for the BJP after the opposition INDIA bloc 's stellar show.Prime Minister Narendra Modi will once again take oath for the third term as the NDA hovers around the 300 mark. But with the surprising mandate to INDIA bloc, the BJP has managed to get a mandate on only 240 seats for now. So as the BJP celebrates the victory and the INDIA bloc leaders hold press conferences with new confidence, the results seem to have turned the tables for the two faction.After slogans like 'abki baar Modi sarkar' in 2014 and 'fir ek baar Modi sarkar' in 2019, the BJP election campaign this time revolved around 'abki baar 400 paar'. With the warcry, PM Modi set a new target for the NDA of 400 seats tally. Just after conclusion of four phases of voting, several BJP leaders, including Home Minister Amit Shah, claimed the BJP alone have already secured 270 of the 380 polled seats.What added to the narrative were the exit poll predictions which pegged the NDA at 350-400 seats. Six exit polls projected 355 to 380 seats for the NDA. Three pollsters, including Axis-My India also predicted the NDA will touch the 400 mark, driving the markets to a record high.The exit polls positioned the opposition's INDIA bloc between 125 and 165 seats. The leaders, as a matter of fact, completely dismissed the pollsters.The final results, however, have actually revealed that the exit polls were far off the mark. The INDIA bloc has not only crossed the 200-seat mark but also made made massive gains when compared to the 2019 numbers. On the other hand, the BJP now relies on its allies to come back to power.The BJP had won a majority of its own when it won power in 2014, ending an era of unstable coalition governments, and repeated the feat in 2019 by crossing the majority mark with 303 seats. This was the highest seat tally of a single party after 1991 elections when the Congress got 244 seats.But this time, the BJP will have to depend on its allies, particularly N Chandrababu Naidu's TDP and Nitish Kumar's JD(U) to form the government at the Centre.On the other hand, the Opposition's INDIA bloc eludes new energy after results, as it manages to cross the 230 mark.","The Bharatiya Janata Party-led NDA is set to form the government at the Centre for the third consecutive term.

NEW DELHI: The 2024 Lok Sabha election results have thrown up a major surprise with the NDA winning 294 seats and the INDIA opposition bloc making major gains and securing 233 seats. Though an NDA government and a third term for Prime Minister Narendra Modi is all but certain, it will be a rocky start for the incumbent regime.As per data on the Election Commission website, the BJP has won 240 seats, which is 30 seats short of majority and a whopping 63 seats less than its tally in the 2019 polls.The final figure means the BJP will be relying heavily on its NDA partners to form the government.Far from '400 paar', it seems the BJP-led NDA will have to contend with a shaky majority based entirely on alliance partners sticking together.With the BJP winning 240 seats, much less than the 303 seats it won in 2019, its vote share has seen a slight dip.In 2019, the BJP had secured around 37.36% of the total votes, this time data show that the saffron party has cornered a vote share of 36.56% -- a decrease of 0.8 percentage points. Though the dip is slight, the affect on the BJPs seat share has been massive.The Congress meanwhile cornered 21.19% of the vote share -- an improvement of nearly 1.7 percentage points compared to the 19.49% it registered in the 2019 polls. Though a marginal increase, it has translated into the Congress nearly doubling its tally compared to 52 seats in the 2019 polls.Regional parties across 5 states have made major gains in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.In Bihar, the Nitish Kumar-led JD(U) has won 12 seats while the BJP has also won 12. Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) has won 5 seats while the Rashtriya Janata Dal has won 4. In 2019, the BJP had won 17 seats on its own, JD(U) 16.In Jharkhand, the Hemant Soren-led Jharkhand Mukti Morcha has won 3 seats. On January 31, Hemant Soren was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate. He handed over his resignation letter to the Governor of Jharkhand, who appointed Champai Soren as his designated replacement.The BJP has won 8 seats. In 2019, it had won 12 of 14 seats.The power of the region parties was particularly pronounced in Maharashtra where the Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena (UBT) and Sharad Pawar-led NCPSP made major gains.In 2019, the BJP had won 23 of 48 seats while its ally Shiv Sena had won 18. This time around, however, the BJP has won just 9 seats while the Ajit Pawar-led NCP has secured 1 seat and the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena has won 7 seats.Meanwhile, Shiv Sena UBT has won 9 seats and Sharad Pawar's NCP 8. The Congress meanwhile is leading the charge with 13 seats in the bag.In the most shocking setback for the BJP, the party has won just 33 of 80 seats in Uttar Pradesh. A far cry from the 62 seats it won in the 2019 polls. The Samajwadi Party on the other hand has made major gains and has won 37 seats, it won only 5 seats in the last general elections.In West Bengal, the Trinamool Congress has bettered its 2019 tally. It has won 29 seats; the TMC had won 22 seats in 2019. Meanwhile, the BJP, which had won 18 seats in 2019, has secured 12 seats this time.In 2019, the BJP had won 176 of the 225 seats in the 10 states the Hindi belt is composed of: Uttar Pradesh (62 seats won out of 80), Uttarakhand (5/5), Bihar (17/40), Jharkhand (11/14), Chhattisgarh (9/11), Madhya Pradesh (28/29), Delhi (7/7), Haryana (10/10), Himachal Pradesh (3/4) and Rajasthan (24/25).This time around, the BJP has won just 126 of the 225 seats. The saffron party suffered the biggest setbacks in Uttar Pradesh (32 seats won out of 80 seats), Haryana (5/10) and Rajasthan (14/25).The saffron party has also lost ground in Bihar (12/40) and Jharkhand (8/14).In Uttarakhand (5/5), Chhattisgarh (10/11), Madhya Pradesh (29/29), Delhi (7/7) and Himachal Pradesh (4/4), the BJP has either kept its dominance or even bettered its 2019 performance.Muslim voters seem to have veered away from the BJP, as per data released by the Election Commission. This, however, did not translate into an advantage for the Congress.In 2019, out of the 103 Muslim-dominated seats, the BJP had won 45, Congress 11 and others 47.This time around, however, the BJP won 35 seats, Congress 12 and others 55.The BJP's target of ridding India of the Congress now seems even farther out of reach. In 2019, the Congress was reduced to just 52 seats, however, it has made major gains this time securing 99 seats.Buoyed by seat-sharing arrangements with its INDIA bloc members, the Congress has won big in Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Telangana.In Telangana, the Congress won 8 of 17 seats. In 2019, it had won just 3 seats in the state.In Maharashtra, the Congress won 13 seats. In 2019, it had won just 1 seat.In Rajasthan, the Congress had failed to open its Lok Sabha account in 2019. This time around, it has won 8 seats.In Haryana too, the Congress had won 0 seats in the last elections, but now has won 5 seats and is neck and neck with the BJP.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's south-north Bharat Jodo Yatra, and subsequent east-west Nyay Yatra seems to have had a major positive impact for the party.States he visited during the yatras have seen major shift towards the Congress.During a presser on Tuesday, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge highlighted how Rahul's yatras convinced lakhs of voters to introspect and ditch the BJP and ""politics of hatred"".Rahul, who is contesting from Wayanad in Kerala and Rae Bareli in Uttar Pradesh, won both seats with large margins.Rahul cornered 59.69% of votes and won against Communist Party of India's Annie Raja with a vote margin of 3.6 lakh. BJP came a distant third, garnering 13% of the votes.In Rae Bareli, Rahul secured an even more decisive win and cornered 66.17% of the votes -- nearly 10 percentage points more than what his mother Sonia Gandhi commanded when she won the seat in 2019. Rahul defeated BJP's Pratap Singh by a vote margin of 3.9 lakh.The pran pratishtha of Ram temple in Ayodhya was seen by experts as a clincher for the BJP in UP and beyond. The strategy, however, seems to have not at all worked for the saffron party.In Faizabad -- the Lok Sabha seat under which Ayodhya comes -- Samajwadi Party's Awadhesh Prasad beat BJP candidate Lallu Singh by a margin of over 54,000 votes.As per the election results, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) has failed to open its account in Uttar Pradesh. In 2019, the BSP had won 10 seats, up from 0 in 2014.This time around, the BSP has cornered just 9.39% of the votes, down nearly 10 percentage points compared to 19.43% of votes it commanded in the 2019 polls.Even when it had won no seats in 2014, the BSP had still cornered 19.77% of the votes.Despite the major setbacks in the Hindi heartland states, the BJP made major strides in Odisha where it won 20 of the 21 seats.The Congress won 1 seat while Naveen Patnaik's BJD failed to open its account.In 2019, the BJD had won 12 seats and the BJP 8.The BJD's vote share this time around was 37.53%, nearly 5.3 percentage points less than what it had secured in 2019. The BJP's vote share meanwhile has gone up from 38.4% in 2019 to 45.34% in 2024.Can freebies win you elections? Or to put it more succinctly, can freebies alone win elections? It seems not.Telangana under KCR was a showcase state of freebies model. It helped him win 2 consecutive elections. But the freebie-led model reached its expiry in the third assembly elections. All the freebies could not help KCR win Telangana for the third time.Next, YSRCP under Jagan Mohan had depended a lot on its freebies to win the Andhra assembly elections again. But Chandrababu Naidu, with his promise of more, has managed to win over voters and the state.There is no denying that freebies play their part in winning elections. But the thing with freebies is that someone can always promise more. But it is increasingly becoming obvious: Freebies may be necessary but not sufficient to win elections.The major twist in the Lok Sabha results now point to heated battles in upcoming assembly polls in Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Haryana.Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena and Sharad Pawar-led NCPSP along with the Congress now seem to be in a very strong position going into the assembly elections in the state, which are likely to take place sometime in October this year.The arrest of Jharkhand former CM Hemant Soren seems to have positively impacted the party, possibly due to sympathy vote as the JMM has repeatedly said the BJP is leading a political witch-hunt against the party. Along with a resurgent Congress, the assembly polls in Jharkhand -- sometime in November or December this year -- is likely to be a tough contest for the BJP.In Haryana, the BJP government is already facing the ire of disgruntled farmers; and the JJP, which has 10 assembly seats, has pulled away from the alliance. With the Congress now in a stronger position, the polls -- to be held sometime in October this year -- will see a tough contest with the BJP fighting an uphill battle.","The 2024 Lok Sabha election results have thrown up a major surprise with the NDA winning 294 seats and the INDIA opposition bloc making major gains and securing 233 seats.

MUMBAI: With his Shiv Sena (UBT) winning 9 of the 21 Maharashtra Lok Sabha seats it contested as part of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance, the results are a mixed bag for Uddhav Thackeray , who has lost the official party name and symbol to the rival Eknath Shinde-led formation .Thackeray had built a narrative of betrayal around the ‘mashaal’ or flaming torch (his symbol), ever since Shinde mobilised a majority of Sena MPs and MLAs to ally with BJP two years ago. Sena (UBT) has won two seats more than the Shinde-led party and seven of 13 in which it was pitted against the latter. In Mumbai, where the party was founded, Sena (UBT) won three of the four seats it contested. But it has lost in Konkan, which was another of its strongholds.“I had expected we would win more seats. We have certain suspicions…in Mumbai North West, we will challenge the election of Ravindra Waikar. We have lost the seat in Konkan, this is a surprise but we will see why this happened,” Uddhav said.The results mean redemption for Thackeray, who recast a party founded on hardline Hindutva ideals to make common cause with Congress and NCP. Shinde’s charge that the Thackerays reneged on party founder Balasaheb’s core values haven’t stuck. The outcome is also significant because Sena (UBT) held on despite snapping ties with BJP, which was seen as the dominant partner in Lok Sabha campaigns. Thackeray is now in a position to be the opposition’s CM face for the Maharashtra assembly polls in October“Sena’s core Marathi voters have stayed with Thackeray and he has managed to add Muslim and Dalit voters. This makes him the most acceptable face for assembly polls,” said an observer. The Lok Sabha results also show vote transfer can take place among MVA allies. With the state showing strong anti-incumbency amid a farm crisis and anxiety about jobs and price rise, Thackeray will be in mission mode for the assembly polls.Sena (UBT) functionaries also expect many workers and mid-level office bearers from the Shinde group to return. While Thackeray has said that his doors are shut for defector MLAs and MPs, he may take back mid-level functionaries and grassroots workers. “Uddhav may go on an overdrive to woo former corporators and shakha-level workers even if MLAs and MPs aren’t taken back,” said an observer. Come Oct, Sena (UBT) would also eye a big chunk of assembly seats within MVA.","Shiv Sena (UBT) won 9 of the 21 Maharashtra Lok Sabha seats it contested as part of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance.

LUCKNOW: All four Samajwadi Party ( SP ) Muslim candidates fielded came out with flying colours despite facing tough BJP competition as the community voted en bloc in favour of the Akhilesh Yadav led party as well as his INDIA ally Congress .SP fielded just four Muslims in a bid to shrug off its image as a party of Muslims and Yadavs (MY). This was against 20 put into the fray by BSP. The pattern was so stark that the 20 BSP candidates not only failed to win but managed to get a very small share of votes. The four SP Muslim winners were Iqra Hasan (Kairana), Mohinullah Nadvi (Rampur), Zia Ur Rehman (Sambhal) and Afzal Ansari (Ghazipur).The outcome this time is a far cry from not too long ago when Muslims were seen as a deciding factor on at least a dozen seats of BJP-governed UP’s 80 Lok Sabha seats.Then came a stage when BJP managed to bring most castes under Hindutva umbrella, rendering minorities’ votes almost redundant. The state’s 19% Muslim population was regarded by many as fragmented “tactical voters” who would vote for anyone in a position to defeat the saffron party.That pattern has snapped this time, with Muslims managing to break the two moulds and voting as a homogeneous entity for SP and INDIA bloc, irrespective of the candidate.As per the exit polls assessments available in public domain, 87% of the Muslim votes polled went to the INDIA bloc across the state which reflected a massive increase of 38% from 2019 polls. Most of these voters — 34% to be precise — were those who voted for BSP in the last parliamentary polls. The exit polls found that only 2% of the Muslim votes went to BSP, down from 36% in 2019. The exit poll has also found that against the 12% Muslim votes that went to BJP in the last Lok Sabha elections, this time only 6% went to the saffron party.BJP made Muslims a large part of its 2024 Lok Sabha campaign, with various party leaders and even Prime Minister Narendra Modi asking the community to vote keeping in mind the future of the generations to come. In UP, the coming together of Congress and SP worked to consolidate the community votes in a big way. The growing perception in the community that Mayawati had sided with BJP, only helped the opposition alliance better.In 2019 LS polls, 6 Muslims made it to Parliament, three of whom were from Mayawati’s party —Danish Ali (Amroha: BSP), Afzal Anasari (Ghazipur: BSP) and Fazlur Rehman (Saharanpur: BSP).",Samajwadi Party fielded just four Muslims in a bid to shrug off its image as a party of Muslims and Yadavs. This was against 20 put into the fray by BSP.

JAIPUR: Rajasthan’s Lok Sabha mandate Tuesday defied predictions to dash BJP’s hopes of making a clean sweep of the desert state’s 25 Lok Sabha seats for the third consecutive election.Congress, along with its INDIA bloc partners, won 11 seats to not only dent BJP’s ambitions but also prove wrong exit poll projections that had given the saffron party around 20 seats.While BJP was restricted to 14 seats, Congress snagged eight, just over six months after the saffron party unseated the erstwhile the Ashok Gehlot govt in the assembly polls. INDIA bloc partners won in Sikar (CPM’s Amra Ram), Banswara (BAP’s Rajkumar Roat) and Nagaur (RLP’s Hanuman Beniwal).BJP’s vote share dipped from 59.1% in 2019 to 49.2%, reflecting the party’s sudden slide after a strong showing in the assembly polls.Anti-incumbency against sitting MPs, the supposedly underwhelming performance of the new state govt and Congress’s poll campaign focused on safeguarding the Constitution and SC-ST reservations are being cited as the decisive factors in the poll.Victory margins of Congress in six of the eight seats it won was less than a lakh votes each. Also, most of the seats that Congress and its allies won had voted in Phase-I on April 19.Among the Phase-II seats, which went to polls on April 26, Congress won Tonk-Sawai Madhopur and Barmer, while BAP got Banswara. PM Modi’s “mangalsutra” remark criticising Congress’s wealth redistribution promise was first heard at a rally in Banswara on April 24.Union minister Kailash Choudhary lost badly from Barmer, finishing third. Congress candidate Ummedaram Beniwal defeated independent candidate and sitting Sheo MLA Ravindra Singh Bhati by 1.2 lakh votes from here.Union ministers Bhupendra Yadav (Alwar) and Arjun Ram Meghwal (Bikaner) won by slim margins, while Gajendra Singh Shekhawat (Jodhpur) recorded a convincing victory by 1.1 lakh votes. Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla won Kota by around 42,000 votes.BJP’s loss in Bharatpur, which is CM Bhajan Lal Sharma’s home turf, left the saffron brigade perplexed. There, Congress greenhorn Sanjana Jatav defeated former MP Ramswaroop Koli of BJP by nearly 52,000 votes.East Rajasthan saw a strong performance from Congress. The party also did well in north and northeast Rajasthan, winning Ganganagar, Churu and Jhunjhunu. In west Rajasthan, Con gress won Barmer, but former CM Gehlot’s son, Vaibhav, lost Jalore by over 2 lakh votes.BJP’s Mahima Kumari Mewar had the biggest win margin, defeating Congress’s Damodar Gurjar by 3.9 lakh votes in Rajsamand. The closest contest was for Jaipur Rural, where BJP’s Rao Rajendra Singh defeated Congress’s Anil Chopra by 1,615 votes.Ex-CM Gehlot wrote on X, “The first phase of voting in Rajasthan sent a message to the entire country that the dictatorial nature of this government can be fought against. The wave that started in the first phase in Rajasthan reached the entire country. India alliance winning double digit seats in Rajasthan shows that the public felt that despite good schemes and good governance, BJP misled people and took votes and formed the government (in Rajasthan). I think that as a kind of atonement, the public has taught BJP a lesson (in LS polls).”","Congress, along with its INDIA bloc partners, won 11 seats to dent BJP’s ambitions.

LUCKNOW: In a stunning setback to NDA in UP, SP-Congress combine won 43 Lok Sabha seats , restricting BJP and its allies to just 36 which was a loss of 28 seats compared to the 64 seats that NDA won in 2019. BJP vote share dropped from 49.97% in 2019 to just over 41% this time.SP and Congress won 37 and 6 seats, respectively — a significant rise of 37 seats than in 2019 when the two had together won six seats.Smriti Irani was among the seven Union ministers who lost in the state. Irani’s loss to Gandhi family loyalist KL Sharma in Amethi by a margin of over 1.6 lakh votes evinced keen interest as she had defeated Rahul Gandhi in this seat last time by over 55,000 votes.'While PM Narendra Modi and defence minister Rajnath Singh saw their victory margins falling, Rahul won by over 3.9 lakh votes. SP won all five seats from where members of the Yadav first family contested — Kannauj (Akhilesh Yadav), Mainpuri (Dimple Yadav), Badaun (Aditya Yadav), Farrukhabad (Akshay Yadav) and Azam garh (Dharmendra Yadav).SP’s emphatic win was a perceptible increase compared to 2019 when the party, in alliance with BSP, could win only five seats.Congress, too, sprung a surprise by winning six seats including both its stronghold of Rae Bareli and Amethi. Congress also won from Saharanpur after a gap of 40 years.Nagina was won by Azad Samaj Party (Kanshi Ram) chief Chandrashekhar Azad, in a development that endorsed his political rise in west UP. At the same time,Mayawati-led BSP faced a complete decimation with its vote share dipping from over 19% in 2019 to just around 9% this time, turning the spotlight back on the Dalit outfit’s sharply plunging political relevance in UP.BJP ally RLD managed to win its two seats of Baghpat and Bijnor, thereby coming back to national politics after its two consecutive decimations in the previous two Lok Sabha polls at the hands BJP.But BJP’s other ally Apna Dal could retain only one seat, Mirzapur, from where Union minister Anupriya Patel won. Two other allies, SPSP and NISHAD party, lost in Ghosi and Sant Kabir Nagar, respectively.SP vote share increased from 18.11% in 2019 — it had then contested on 37 seats — to over 33% this time when it contested on 62 seats. The increase was essentially because of the comprehensive consolidation of Muslims behind the alliance. SP is also reported to have received the support of a section of OBCs and Dalits who had drifted away from BSP and BJP.SP’s significantly improved tally bolstered its position as BJP’s main rival in Uttar Pradesh, in what could potentially set a poll narrative in the run-up to the 2027 UP polls.","SP and Congress won 37 and 6 seats, respectively — a significant rise of 37 seats than in 2019 when the two had together won six seats.

Leading INDIA bloc’s campaign in Tamil Nadu, DMK president and chief minister M K Stalin played two roles: one, as the last sentinel against a saffron surge in the South; two, as a victim of the Centre’s partisanship in funding states. He has emerged victorious, his alliance winning all the 40 seats in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry.Keeping his coalition flock — Congress, CPM, CPI, VCK and IUML — together, Stalin has retained national prominence. The DMK president may not have prime ministerial ambitions but his stature as an entrenched regional satrap gives him a centrality like his father M Karunanidhi enjoyed for decades. The Lok Sabha victory may even be seen as vindication after bruising corruption charges against at least two of his ministers.A post-Covid outreach in healthcare and education along with proactive administrative measures by his govt has held anti-incumbency in check. Going forward, a friendly relationship with the Centre would help Stalin, especially since his state faces financial challenges. But the DMK president cannot cosy up to Modi when the next assembly election in Tamil Nadu is less than two years away. After all, it was his strident anti-BJP stand that gave him a decisive lead in atriangular contest. Even after AIADMK, which he had dubbed ‘BJP’s B team’, quit NDA in Sept 2023, DMK kept criticising it for a “secret pact” with BJP. Stalin’s message was clear: I am the supreme Dravidian commander against Hindutva. That was his USP.DMK benefited from a divided opposition. If its rivals (PMK included) choose to join hands, 2026 could be harder than 2021, when DMK won 133 of 234 assembly seats. The TN chief minister has his work cut out, especially with BJP gaining in vote share. BJP state president K Annamalai was able to set a narrative that the battle — in terms of optics and decibel levels — was between DMK and BJP. The Sta lin-Annamalai war of words was so shrill that AIADMK general secretary Edappadi K Palaniswami’s criticism of Stalin — and at times BJP — was barely audible.While he is DMK’s undisputed leader at 71, Stalin will have to pass on the mantle sooner than later. The expected elevation of his son Udhayanidhi as deputy CM may give more ammo to Stalin’s detractors, but as long as DMK functionaries accept the rising son’s ascent without a murmur, dynasty politics may not harm the party’s electoral prospects. BJP, rising slowly as it is, may not be an immediate threat, but actor Vijay’s electoral entry as a disruptor in 2026 can trigger unexpected churns.","DMK president and chief minister M K Stalin played two roles: one, as the last sentinel against a saffron surge in the South; two, as a victim of the Centre’s partisanship in funding states. The Lok Sabha victory may even be seen as vindication after bruising corruption charges against at least two of his ministers.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110717930,imgsize-1276168,width-400,resizemode-4/110717930.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Unlike the trend of BJP loosening its hold on several states it had swept in 2019, the party again held Delhi in a vice-like grip winning all the seven seats for the third consecutive general elections. And like in the elections of 2019, BJP's vote share was over 50 per cent this year too.The saffron party's Ramvir Singh Bidhuri won in South Delhi, Yogender Chandoliya in North-West Delhi, Bansuri Swaraj in New Delhi, Harsh Malhotra in East Delhi, Kamaljeet Sehrawat in West Delhi, Praveen Khandelwal in Chandni Chowk and Manoj Tiwari in North-East Delhi.Except for Tiwari, the party had put up fresh candidates this year, and BJP city seniors said this helped counter anti-incumbency and keep the cadres motivated. ""When you are able to convince the electorate that your party is forming the govt at the centre, the fence-sitters also emerge in your support,"" explained a senior functionary.Delhi BJP unit president Virendra Sachdeva said, ""The people of the capital gave us this mandate for the works done by PM Narendra Modi for Delhi and for his visionary leadership."" Party functionaries said that the campaign had been decided months in advance to centre on two talking points: the performance of PM Modi and the corruption allegations against AAP, including about the excise policy, renovation of the CM's house and financial discrepancies in Delhi Jal Board.""AAP is no longer the party seen as a group of honest people with noble intentions. The liquor policy has exposed them and three of their top leaders are in jail on corruption charges with the courts refusing to grant them bail,"" said Sachdeva.With the Lok Sabha polls wrapped up, BJP anticipates the resounding win to provide it the impetus it needs for the assembly elections eight months away. The party has encountered obstacles in the previous assembly polls, winning, respectively, just three and eight seats in 2015 and 2020, despite sweeping the stakes in the two Lok Sabha elections held a year prior to each in 2014 and 2019.BJP insiders, therefore, feel the 2025 assembly polls could similarly prove arduous due not only to the absence of a compelling narrative to counter AAP's populist policy but also because of factionalism within the state unit.A party functionary admitted that BJP, which last formed the government in Delhi in 1993, lacked a charismatic figure to rival Arvind Kejriwal. He also conceded an overreliance on the Modi factor and this places them at a disadvantage in state and local polls. This was one of the reasons AAP was able to wrest control of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi from BJP in 2022.The clean sweep will result in a larger share of development projects for the city, BJP functionaries hoped. One of them said, ""With BJP also forming the govt at the Centre, Delhi can again expect a larger share of development funds as it has been doing. Delhi is the first state in the country that got the regional rapid rail besides the Delhi-Bombay, Delhi-Dehradun and Saharanpur expressways,"" he said, adding, ""You can expect more such projects. There is also a huge demand for the expansion of Delhi Metro to the fringes of the city and we have committed to our voters that we would accomplish this.""",The saffron party's Ramvir Singh Bidhuri won in South Delhi.

A young greenhorn Congress worker from Kalighat — wearing a sari and hawai chappals — has just done the unbelievable, defeating CPM veteran Somnath Chatterjee from Jadavpur, the reddest of red citadels. Mamata Banerjee herself seems surprised and pundits attribute her victory to the sympathy wave that Congress benefited from after Indira Gandhi’s assassinationMamata Banerjee is canvassing for votes at Jadavpur’s Baro Bhooter Math (translated as the “ground belonging to a dozen ghosts”). She can work up the crowd to her will and asks for this seat once more so that she can help INDIA bloc in Lok Sabha, never mind that the alliance is not on in BengalIn a political career of five decades, Banerjee has proved her critics wrong multiple times. After a bruis ing, months-long campaign, with her party winning 29 seats in Bengal — its second best Lok Sabha performance after 2014 when it won 34 — she has had the last laugh again. The tally has gone up substantially from 22 in 2019.Leading the party with 108 public rallies and multiple road shows, one of which saw her walk 12km at a stretch on her south Kolkata home turf, Banerjee, 69, criss-crossed from Coochbehar in the northernmost extreme to South 24 Parganas, where Bengal meets the Bay of Bengal. She went to Nandigram, where she lost in 2021 (a legal battle is still on over BJP’s alleged electoral malpractices). And Sandeshkhali, where her partymen have been accused of rape and land-grab, before sting videos threw up a counter-narrative of allegations being “BJP-engineered”.This journey, where PM Modi’s campaign has tried to shift the burden of anti-incumbency to the state govt, was to reach the hearts of Bengal’s women (through schemes like Lakshmir Bhandar) and its minorities (with about a quarter of the state’s votes), even trying to establish Trinamool as a nativist party of the Bengali-Hindu majority through references to Durga Puja (now a Unescorecognised “intangible cultural heritage”) and the legacy of Swami Vivekananda.Questioned for her decision to go solo, which had the potential to split traditional minority votes, Banerjee has been proven right — the community stood rock solid behind her. By splitting the Bengal battle into a three-way contest, Trinamool’s gains outweigh its losses. In the close contests which went its way, Congress-Left vote shares were higher than Trinamool’s victory margins, indicating a split in anti-Trina mool votes. Difference in vote share in 2024 between Trinamool and BJP has widened to 10%.With a final tally of 29 seats — third highest among opposition parties in India (after Congress and SP) — it gains more elbow room in INDIA bloc. That Left-Congress barely scraped through with one seat in Bengal also vindicates a pre-poll offer by Banerjee for 2-3 seats. The results may settle the unease in the Congress-Trinamool relationship. Banerjee has already said she disapproves of the way CPM “monitors” Congress in INDIA bloc.Finally, the Trinamool win sets up a lot of expectations. Most importantly, Banerjee has promised to ease the central fund flow into MGNREGA in Bengal. Her social schemes have been a defining factor. A weakened BJP at the Centre, and a stronger INDIA bloc, allows her to go beyond the anti-Centre pitch and get work done.","Mamata Banerjee has proved her critics wrong multiple times.

NEW DELHI: It is indeed ironical that when the INDIA bloc has given a tough fight to NDA, Arvind Kejriwal — with govt in two states — and his party have suffered a huge setback. In fact, the poll outcome shows a loss of credibility for brand Kejriwal. The AAP campaign pitch virtually called for a referendum on the Delhi chief minister’s arrest in the liquor policy case, portraying it as vendetta politics by BJP. This very neatly dovetailed with its criticism of LG V K Saxena for being the Centre’s malicious agent.What did AAP gain after 21 days of campaigning by its chief, who was out on interim bail? It had an alliance with Congress in Delhi and they drew a blank on all 7 seats. The Punjab story is even more dire. It has won only 3 out of 13 seats in the state where it is the ruling party. And it has failed to win any seat in Gujarat, Assam and Haryana.This puts a question mark on AAP’s relevance as a player of significance in the INDIA alliance. The party’s bargaining power in INDIA alliance will be considerably weakened with more powerful regional satraps calling the shots.It can, however, take solace from the fact that with NDA’s tally reduced, and BJP doing introspection, its mascot can expect some respite from central agencies. However, if Kejriwal insists on continuing as CM while in jail, he has to contend with the possibility of Central rule being imposed and assembly polls being called for earlier than Feb next year when the AAP govt completes five years.The slogan of “jail ka jawab vote se” didn’t yield a mandate for the party. The poll results also show that Kejriwal’s ‘Delhi model of development’ and its projection in Punjab, where it had swept the assembly polls in 2022, did not impress the electorate enough to choose AAP over BJP and Congress.AAP had joined politics promising an “alternative” to traditional parties like BJP and Congress, calling them corrupt. When it struck an alliance with Congress, it did not sit well with voters who saw it as an opportunistic move. The argument that AAP had joined INDIA in order to defeat a dictatorial dispensation at the Centre seems to have been lost on the electorate.The party, which had secured an impressive victory in Punjab assembly polls in 2022, getting catapulted into the limelight as a party that could be a national player of significance, failed to perform in the state winning just 3 seats – Sangrur, Anandpur Sahib and Hoshiarpur. Congress got 7 out of 13. Significantly, both AAP and Congress had agreed not to fight in an alliance in the face of resistance from state units who felt going separately would work better. That clearly worked for Congress, leaving AAP high and dry.As part of the INDIA alliance, AAP and Congress were also in the poll fray jointly in Gujarat. AAP contested in two constituencies – Bharuch and Bhavnagar — with the former being the home turf of later Congress stalwart Ahmed Patel. Congress has won one out of the 24 seats it contested. BJP bagged 25 out of 26. AAP drew a blank.Besides, AAP also lost Kurukshetra to BJP while Congress, which fought on 9 seats in Haryana, won 5. Kejriwal’s party was also defeated in two constituencies in Assam.With Kejriwal seen as the face of AAP in Delhi and beyond, with no other person to take over reins of the party and govt in sight yet, the way forward for his party will be determined by how long he remains in jail and how far he is able to run the show from inside while keeping his flock together.","AAP has won only 3 out of 13 seats in the state where it is the ruling party.

Himanta: Will N-E star campaigner lose sheen?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/himanta-will-n-e-star-campaigner-lose-sheen/articleshow/110717716.cms,"Lok Sabha Elections Assembly Elections Party View Alliance View Majority: 272 543 543 Seats: 543 Results NDA WON NDA 293 INDIA 234 OTH 16 View MapView Details Source: Pvalue

Lok Sabha election results present a complex picture for Himanta Biswa Sarma , Assam chief minister and key architect of BJP’s vision in the North-East. Despite his significant role in BJP’s national campaigns, the party’s and NDA’s performance in the North-East, especially in Manipur , raise questions about his future trajectory.In his home state of Assam, the party retained the same tally as 2019 but failed to improve its performance. While Sarma wasn’t directly involved in campaigning in the North-East, except Assam, the region’s electoral outcomes now raise questions about his ability to deliver in his own backyard.BJP’s decision to deploy Sarma outside the region, leaving the regional leadership to manage their own campaigns, can be interpreted as a strategic move to utilise his skills on a national platform, potentially grooming him for a larger role within the party. Conversely, it could also suggest a deliberate distancing from the complexities of the North-East, especially given the sensitive political climate and BJP’s mixed record in the region.This can be a crucial juncture in Sarma’s political future. While his national profile within BJP has undoubtedly risen, the party’s setbacks, especially in Manipur, might lead to a reassessment of his influence and standing within the party. Whether the central leadership continues to repose the same level of trust in him, and how they choose to utilize his political capital in the future, remains to be seen. Sarma’s political journey started with the Congress party.However, he lost his first assembly election in 1996. But that did not obstruct his quick rise through the ranks, holding important ministerial portfolios in the Assam government. Recognising the shifting political winds, he made a decisive move to the BJP in 2015, a decision that proved instrumental in the party’s historic victory in Assam the following year. In the run-up to the 2016 Assam assembly elections, Sarma proved his mettle as BJP’s most dependable backroom strategist.His deft maneuvering facilitated the defection of nine Congress MLAs to BJP, providing a significant boost to the party’s prospects. This strategic move paid dividends, as BJP tasted its first electoral victory in Assam, a state long considered a Congress bastion.Recognising Sarma’s contributions, then BJP president Amit Shah entrusted him with the pivotal role of convenor of the newly formed North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA). This miniature version of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) brought together almost all the regional parties of the North-East under a unified umbrella, solidifying the BJP’s foothold in the region.Sarma’s strategic prowess continued to bear fruit as BJP secured the defection of 43 Congress MLAs in Arunachal Pradesh, paving way for formation of the party’s government in the state. This remarkable feat was followed by BJP’s first government in Manipur and historic ousting of the formidable Left Front in Tripura, a state where they had held sway for decades. A wave of political change swept across North-East, with Nagaland, Meghalaya, and Mizoram also witnessing the formation of NEDA/ NDA governments. However, now there are new twists to this success story.","Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma is key architect of BJP’s vision in the North-East.

The party, in its original avatar as TRS , was formed in 2001 and contested its first Lok Sabha election in 2004 winning five seats as part of the UPA alliance. It won two in 2009 in alliance with TDP. In 2014, Telangana was formed and KCR became the undisputed leader of the state. Not winning a single seat this time leaves KCR with no role at the Centre. “Knowing that the LS polls were crucial for his party’s survival, he had embarked on a bus yatra despite undergoing hip replacement. He addressed meetings on is sues like irrigation water from Kaleshwaram project and the Krishna River water issue. The party held protests and demanded that Congress govt implement promises made during the assembly polls. But going by the results, people want to give more time to Congress,” an analyst said.

BRS had won 11 LS seats in 2014 without allies, securing 34% of votes. In 2019, its vote share rose to 41% though it won fewer seats (9). This was months after sweeping assembly polls with 88 of the state’s 117 seats. KCR seemed invincible at that point. In retrospect, it was the stage from where his popularity graph began dipping. He has been unable to arrest the slide since. His “inaccessibility” and unresolved local issues like state public service commission question paper leaks, joblessness among urban youth, allegations of corruption have dented his image.","The party, in its original avatar as TRS, was formed in 2001.

PATNA: There was much at stake for the family of RJD chief Lalu Prasad in the Lok Sabha elections. His two daughters — Misa Bharti and Rohini Acharya – were contesting from Patliputra and Saran respectively, while younger son and political heir Tejashwi Prasad Yadav was leading the combined Opposition for the first time in a general election.After drawing a blank in the 2019 LS polls, RJD has managed to claw back lost ground by winning 4 of the 26 seats it fought, including Patliputra where Misa contested. Tejashwi has now set the tone for the assembly elections due next year; the verdict makes it clear that he will be the opposition’s face for Bihar CM against Nitish Kumar or a BJP candidate. In all, the RJD member and his allies (Congress and CPI-ML) have won 9 of the total 40 seats.Tejashwi has already had his share of ups and downs. After the 2015 state polls which RJD contested with JD(U), he became deputy CM. By sticking to an agenda of jobs, employment, education, and health, the 34-year-old Tejashwi generated a following among the youth. He largely succeed ed in conveying the message that it was he who facilitated “5 lakh jobs in 17 months” as deputy CM of Bihar.Tejashwi did not resort to personal attacks on Nitish when he lost his job after the JD(U) veteran parted ways with RJD in Jan this year. Instead, by refusing to needle Nitish, Tejashwi kept observers guessing. He provoked speculation about Nitish’s plans when he said that “chacha” would take a big decision after the June 4 poll results. It forced Nitish to make it clear in his public meetings that he would never part ways with BJP.Nitish’s about-turns have given Tejashwi an opportunity to emerge from the shadow of his father and RJD chief Lalu Prasad. He has established himself not only as the face of his party but also of the opposition bloc. The elections have also proved Tejashwi’s willingness to experiment by fielding candidates of castes other than those that traditionally dominate in a particular seat. He picked a Dalit candidate in a constituency meant for the general category. And he fielded Kushwaha candidates — who belong to Nitish’s caste — to dent the NDA vote bank. His ability to look beyond Lalu’s M-Y (Muslim-Yadav) formulation is expected to yield rich dividends in the long run.",Lalu Prasad's daughters Misa Bharti and Rohini Acharya were contesting from Patliputra and Saran respectively.

Not so ‘Upyogi’?

The setback that BJP has received in UP, has come as a stunning reality check for Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath . The Yogi factor — a combination of strong law and order, development and aggressive Hindutva — which was a strong pitch used by BJP in addition to the Modi factor appeared to find resonance on the ground during the campaign.But the ‘double engine’ faltered this time around and SP chief Akhilesh Yadav’s catchphrase ‘PDA’ targeting Picchade (backwards), Dalits and Alpsankhyak (minorities) had a deeper connect with voters, especially Dalits and backwards. Yogi has spearheaded BJP’s consecutive victories in five back-to-back elections in the state — 2017 and 2022 state polls, 2019 Lok Sabha elections and two local body polls before the reversal of the trend.“Since Yogi had been credited with the wins, he will have to take the responsibility for the dismal show also,” says a political observer, adding “but he cannot be made a scapegoat.” The selection of candidates was done ignoring anti-incumbency and brewing resentment against them and has emerged as one of the main reasons for the loss.A party insider said that Yogi stands clear as the candidate selection responsibility rested with the central leadership. “Yogi is seen as a saviour for BJP. He had no say in the selection of candidates. Those who won despite the brewing anger against them will definitely credit Yogi’s contribution along with the Modi factor when they introspect the reasons for their success,” he added. In every election rally that he addressed in UP this time, PM Narendra Modi not only praised the Yogi model of law and order that prepared a conducive atmosphere for investment in the state, but also highlighted his development initiatives.In his quest to get improved numbers, he knows which is the most crucial “engine” he could have banked on. “However, this “double engine” narrative failed to attract voters in the state. This could be because it is a muchflogged slogan and Yogi has reached the halfway mark of the second term of his govt,” says another analyst. To his credit, he was one of the most sought-after campaigners for the party, having addressed nearly 170 rallies — not only in UP but also outside.Before that, he had already visited all 75 districts. But it clearly was not enough and his position in the party’s top echelon will take a beating. The extent could be a matter of debate. However, the narrative set by Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal in the middle of the campaign is back in discussion. While addressing rallies, Kejriwal claimed that after BJP’s win, Yogi will be removed like several other BJP CMs.According to UP watchers, the Delhi CM tried to create a fake narrative that all was not well within the BJP and the top leadership was wary of Yogi because of his growing popularity and it might have impacted a section of voters. “Although he was playing on Yogi’s popularity, giving a message to the latter’s admirers and voters that if you vote for the saffron party, your ‘favourite’ CM would be dispensed with, BJP came out with a rebuttal. However, with BJP losing ground in these polls, this narrative is bound to return to haunt the party,” says a BJP insider.His name also came up during discussions around Thakur protests during the election. The hype around the protest likely affected the party’s prospects, especially in the first two rounds. “But he was not alone. UP BJP’s inability to assess the intensity of the protest will also be discussed in the same breath,” the analyst says and adds it was because of Yogi that the extent of damage was curtailed. Seats won by BJP do reflect the same, he further says.While Yogi is in the third year of his second tenure and his welfare measures have reached the last strata of the society, his govt is yet to earn the trust of the minority community, as apparent from the voting pattern. “This would be a task cut out for his govt to bridge that gap,” says a political analyst. However, while making the governance more robust, the Yogi govt must be wary of its image as being “over-dependent” on bureaucracy. “Ignoring party workers and people’s representatives was a reason quoted for the lack of enthusiasm among party cadre,” he adds.","The Yogi factor — a combination of strong law and order, development and aggressive Hindutva — appeared to find resonance on the ground during the campaign.

PATNA: Politics is a game of possibilities, and no one knows this better than Bihar CM Nitish Kumar who has ditched enough allies over the years. His spectacular performance in the Lok Sabha polls has once again ensured he remains the alliance’s face in Bihar till next year’s assembly polls. More so, because former deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi’s untimely death has left BJP without a stalwart in the state.BJP can, of course, campaign using PM Modi’s name, as it did in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, but given Nitish’s considerable support base among the Extremely Backward Classes ( EBCs ) and women — JD(U) has won 12 of the 16 seats it was allotted under the seat-sharing arrangement — it would not want to distance him.The EBC category comprising 130 small caste groups like Dhanuks, Kumhars, Kahars, Noniyas, Kewats, Nais, Mallahs, Telis and Tatmas, makes up 36% of Bihar’s electorate, as per the recent caste survey. Along with this group, Nitish was backed by support from his Kurmi-Koeri (Kushwaha) community. Kurmis are 2.9% of Bihar’s electorate and Koeris 4.2%. The CM also benefitted from the Mahadalit category comprising 21 castes that he helped create. Mahadalits account for some 10% of the state’s total vote.Women form another pillar of support: Nitish reserved 50% of slots in panchayati raj institutions, urban local bodies and teaching jobs for them. He gave 35% reservation to women in all govt jobs and 33% quota to girl students in medical, engineering and sports institutions. And the blanket ban on liquor in Bihar reduced domestic violence. It’s not surprising that he’s 3.6 crore women voters.Also, vote transfer between BJP and JD(U) has never been an issue. NDA comprising BJP, JD(U), LJP (Ram Vilas), Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular), Rashtriya Lok Morcha appeared to be winning as many as 32 seats in the state and one of the main reasons is smooth transfer of votes among allies.Nitish, who has been Bihar CM for more than 17 years and aUnion minister for more than six years, is known to nurse ambitions of holding a top national-level post: PM, prez or vice-prez. Last time he was in NDA (July 2017 to August 2022), he had wanted to succeed M Venkaiah Naidu as VP. The late Sushil Modi had revealed this and insiders say BJP’s denial of Nitish’s demand had precipitated his turn towards Mahagathbandhan. Again, in Mahagathbandhan, Nitish tried to bring the opposition together to oust PM Modi in 2024, hoping he would be appointed INDIA bloc’s convenor, and PM if the bloc succeeded. But when Congress disappointed him, he rushed into NDA’s embrace.Given these facts, Nitish remains the “axis” of state politics. Strangely, his flipflops has had no impact on voters this time. JD(U) has got 18.50% votes in Bihar, only 2% less than BJP’s 20.53%.",Bihar CM Nitish Kumar has ditched enough allies over the years.

Wooing Dalits & non-Yadav OBCs

The blowback

LUCKNOW: Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav had got off to a good start. His early emphasis on ‘ Pichde (backward), Dalit, Alpasankhyak (minorities)’ was combined with a sharp focus on farmer issues, joblessness, paper leaks and rising prices. It turned out to be one of his best election strategies, backed by intelligent candidate selection.The Samajwadi Party has impressively led the INDIA bloc charge in UP winning 37 of the 62 seats it contested, its best showing in the state in a general election. The PDA formulation, in particular, became a unifying force. The highlight of this newfound “social engineering” was that the party managed to win over Dalits in general and Jatavs in particular who were, till now, seen as traditional BSP voters.This election has also shattered the hypothesis that Dalits and Yadavs can never unite in UP. As per caste assessments based on exit polls, 65% of Scheduled Caste votes polled went to the SP — an increase of 21% as compared to 2019 polls. Of these, 32% of Jatav votes polled went to SP though they have traditionally been committed voters of BSP. The shift was not only from the BSP to SP.SP strategists insist that the jump in Dalit voters was more than what was visible in 2019 Lok Sabha polls. “In 2019, SP had contested elections in alliance with the BSP. So it was no surprise that Dalits voted for our party. This time we contested against BSP and got an overwhelming response from the Dalit community,” said a senior SP functionary.Apart from the PDA pitch, Akhilesh succeeded in turning ‘Abki baar 400 paar’ into a ‘Save the Constitution’ narrative. He was among the first to say that the BJP wanted 400-plus seats to change the Constitution and end reservation for Dalits and backwards. This worked to bind together jobless youths and families from Dalit and backward segments.After the 2019 LS alliance between SP and BSP, when Mayawati had walked away with 10 seats and Akhilesh was left with 5, it was evident that vote transfer between SP and its ally was a one-way street. The SP leadership felt cheated. Party strate gists then shifted their focus to Dalit leaders with whom the party was already in touch.Former BSP minister Ghura Ram, a founding member, was the first big dalit leader to switch loyalties to SP. Soon after, more joined Akhilesh. The SP did not only pick senior leaders. Regional coordinators, former ministers and other officebearers of BSP joined the exodus. Akhilesh made it a point to ensure that in press meets he was accompanied by Dalit leaders.He decided to rope in non-Yadav OBCs as well. By Oct 2021, prominent backward BSP leaders like sitting MLAs Lalji Verma and Ramachal Rajbhar were with SP. The focus on non-Yadav OBCs was aptly reflected in the appointment of his party’s national executive in 2023. Of 62 members in the committee, around 40% were ‘non-Yadav’ OBCs and hailed from electorally influential communities like Kurmi, Rajbhar and Nishads. The list also included six members who were Dalits.As expected, the focus on Dalits and Non-Yadav OBCs left upper caste, Yadav and Muslim functionaries uncomfortable. Those eyeing tickets for 2024 Lok Sabha polls and those offered better deals by BJP were the first ones to snap. But that did not deter Akhilesh from giving tickets as per his PDA formula to all castes and communities.At least 14 candidates were exBSP. In fact, Akhilesh shed the image of the SP being an M-Y party by giving the least number of tickets to Muslims and Yadavs in the party’s history. “Of course, it was all done after taking community leaders into confidence, explaining to them how a large number of Muslim and Yadav candidates help BJP’s bid for counter-polarisation,” said an analyst.For SP strategists, the final highlight was a bunch of victories from unlikely quarters like Faizabad, which it had last won in 1998. “The victory of Awadesh Prasad and the tough fight that Sunita Verma put up against BJP is important as it exposes BJP’s attempt to use religion for political gains,” said a senior SP functionary. Two other important victories for SP came from Rampur and Moradabad—seats which have the maximum Muslim population.","The Samajwadi Party has impressively led the INDIA bloc charge in UP winning 37 of the 62 seats it contested.

In their post-results comments, opposition leaders — from Rahul Gandhi to Mamata Banerjee — described BJP ’s failure to score a majority of its own as PM Narendra Modi ’s defeat. This was to be expected, considering that the entire NDA’s campaign (TDP being a partial exception), was framed around him. His energetic campaign only served to enhance his personal liability. But while results clearly suggest that the law of politics has caught up with him, he has still pulled off a feat which most incumbents in democracy can only dream of. Modi is going to be only the second PM after Jawaharlal Nehru to have secured a third term.In fact, his achievement may be considered even bigger because it comes in a political milieu that is polarised, fragmented and far more competitive than the one Nehru had to reckon with. Moreover, Nehru also had the advantage of having been blessed by none other than Mahatma Gandhi, and being leader of a party that basked in the glow of being the vanguard of the freedom movement.In contrast, Modi arrived as dissent; a challenger to the mainstream. Coming back to 2024, while the tally of 243 looks like a nosedive both from the standards of the 400- paar campaign as well as the widely held perception of the polls being a no-contest, this is the best to have been posted by any non-BJP party since 1984 when Congress rode the massive sympathy wave generated by Indira Gandhi’s assassination. However, the setback has brought to fore issues like price rise and unemployment which emerged as warning signs during the campaign but were seen as minor irritants because of the assumption, wrong and smug as it turned out to be, that an absolute majority was already in the bag.Although Modi did a good job of containing inflation, the assumption that voters would go only by the sincerity of intent, while also taking into account the international pattern of runaway inflation, turned out to be wrong. Modi pushed for expansion of public infrastructure and generation of employment in the informal sector. The calculation that this, along with the post-Covid push for filling up vacancies in central govt jobs, would help assuage the concern about jobs did not come to pass. The retention of sitting BJP MPs, despite internal surveys and cadre feedback flagging their unpopularity, was another big and avoidable mistake. The 400+ target, which was supposed to convey strength and selfassuredness, also boomeranged, with the opposition saying this was part of a design to change the Constitution and scrap quotas. The counter-manoeuvre by Modi in the form of an aggressive pitch against Muslim quota did not work as Hindus voted along caste lines.If anything, it gave an opening to his opponents to renew the charge that he was divisive and desperate. This may have caused consternation to the moderates among his supporters. The resultant reduction in seats has turned the third term into a challenge. Apart from a stronger opposition which is going to be more aggressive, Modi also has to contend with allies like N Chandrababu Naidu and Nitish Kumar, who are not in sync with the themes on BJP’s agenda and may act as restraint.At the same time, RSS will also be keeping a wary eye on how he deals with pressure from allies. But Modi is not alien to struggles. His career is essentially that of negotiating challenges and taking them on at the opportune moment. And, despite the apparent diminution, he will be approaching one with strengths that few can boast of. BJP’s numbers, although reduced, are also a testimony to the goodwill and credibility he enjoys in an age when loyalties are shortlived and fleeting, and goodwill evaporates in the heat of ever-escalating expectations. This is the main reason why BJP could survive the ‘caste’ and ‘consolidation’ card played so adroitly by the opposition.His credentials as a ‘staunch nationalist’ are considered beyond reproach, and the massive upgrade of public infrastructure that happened under his leadership is a lived and real experience that may be appreciated again now that resentments have been vented. The robust exchequer is going to be a strength. Addressing the concerns of Dalits and OBCs cannot be beyond a leader and a party which has been more sensitive to caste sentiments than the older BJP. The third term is going to be his legacy term, and Modi will leave no stone unturned to ensure it is remembered for accomplishments rather than as a weak arrangement. Going by his track record, he may not like to let the challenges become an alibi for non-performance, and a stint which dwarfs the memory of his achievements in the first two terms. Conclusions about decline may yet turn out to be premature.","PM Narendra Modi is going to be only the second PM after Jawaharlal Nehru to have secured a third term.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India has declared results for all Lok Sabha constituencies , with the BJP winning 240 of the 543 seats and the Congress 99. The last result to be announced was that of Beed constituency in Maharashtra, where NCP (Sharad Pawar) candidate Bajrang Manohar Sonwane defeated the BJP's Pankaja Munde by 6,553 votes.While the Lok Sabha has 543 members, counting was held for 542 seats after the BJP's Surat candidate Mukesh Dalal was elected unopposed.According to the final results, declared early on Wednesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is poised to form the government for a third consecutive term with the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance ( NDA ) getting a majority in the Lok Sabha, notwithstanding crushing losses in three Hindi heartland states after a bitterly fought election that was projected as a referendum on his popularity.The BJP, whose candidates contested in the name of Modi, won in 240 seats, falling short of the 272 majority mark and needing the support of allies in the party-led NDA for government formation , a far cry from the 303 and 282 seats it had won in 2019 and 2014, respectively, to have a majority on its own.With support from key allies N Chandrababu Naidu's Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and Nitish Kumar's JD(U), which won 16 and 12 seats in Andhra Pradesh and Bihar, respectively, and other alliance partners, the NDA crossed the halfway mark.The Congress, which is part of the opposition INDIA bloc, won 99 seats compared to 52 it won in 2019, eating into the BJP's share in Rajasthan and Haryana.As the Samajwadi Party kept the INDIA bloc's morale high in Uttar Pradesh with 37 seats, the Trinamool Congress (TMC), another key member of the opposition alliance, won 29 seats in West Bengal, higher than its 2019 tally of 22. The BJP, which had won 18 seats in the last Lok Sabha elections, won 12 seats.The results did not throw up a landslide victory the BJP-led NDA had hoped for and what was projected by the exit polls.More than 640 million votes were to be counted in the world's largest democratic exercise, conducted from April 19 to June 1 in seven phases.","The Election Commission of India has declared results for all Lok Sabha constituencies.

NEW DELHI: In previous national elections , BJP lorded over the social media space. In LS 2024, YouTubers played a significant role in snatching that space out of the saffron party’s grip, thereby improving Congress-led INDIA’s position. Anti-govt influencers earned eyeballs and shaped opinion , even attracting the attention of British weekly, The Economist. As per statista.com, India has 476m YouTube viewers.Statistics shows Dhruv Rathee is the most viewed You Tuber during this election. Rathee’s Modi: The Real Story alone garnered 27m views. Media commentator Sevanti Ninan describes him as “the big new phenomenon of these elections”. Media commentator and columnist Madhavan Narayanan says that YouTubers like him are often playing the role of what mainstream media ought to do: check facts, question self-contradictions and supply meaningful context and background.“People seem to like them for their passion, informality and storytelling styles. News related YouTubers are knowledge jockeys who have replaced staid or shrill TV anchors. I’ve no doubt this has reshaped opinion and media consumption among educated youths and middle classes,” he says.Media commentator Vanita Kohli-Khandekar says national TV gratifies this audience and wonders why no news channel caters to all Indians or to a large section. “There is an information gap. And nature abhors a vacuum. WhatsApp, YouTube, Facebook, Reels and dozens of short video apps fill this gap. Some do a better job than others and therefore get more eyeballs,” she says.Politicians have also sought out YouTube channels to connect with voters which enables them to sidestep the gatekeeping role of mainstream media, Ninan says. “There is a power shift happening within the media universe from companies to individuals,” she says.The impact is noticeable. The govt aims to bring broadcast services, including OTT channels, within its ambit through the proposed Broadcast Services (Regulation) Bill, she says.",Dhruv Rathee is the most viewed You Tuber during this election.

For Congress foraging in the 50s in Lok Sabha over the last decade, the doubling of tally is a psychological victory. The decent score for the crisis-ridden party is seen as its revival, as it comes with appreciable performance in the north and the northeast.The geographical advance was not anticipated in the election that came against the backdrop of the Ayodhya temple inauguration and the party’s woes of resource crunch and defections. The turnaround points to what it has managed to get right – policy , communication and leadership . These are the three fronts on which Congress would feel confident going forward.It has cemented the leadership of the triumvirate of Mallikarjun Kharge-Rahul Gandhi-Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. In 2024 polls, they addressed 315 rallies, communicating with voters and taking on BJP.Marginalised among the urban and upper caste demographics, Congress lurched towards a Mandalite reinvention, espousing causes like “caste census-50% ceiling removal”, along with an aggressive welfarist and secular outreach. Its decimation in the Dec assembly polls had raised doubts about the policy makeover’s efficacy. But LS results have restored its credibility, and Congress may have shed its policy confusion for good.Also, the effective campaign, physical and virtual, has resolved another handicap. The party has been in search of the strategy to counter Modi’s hyper communication.The decision of Sonia Gandhi, Kharge and Rahul to address the media early after the results showed the party is buoyed by its performance. The facts on the ground pointed to a crisis to be overcome, and not a war to be won.Its biggest advantage has been the coming together of regional parties. With Maharashtra and Haryana polls four months away, Congress and allies would fancy their chances on the turfs BJP had come to own over the last decade.The party is still to find an anti-dote to Modi’s national appeal, but it is set to draw confidence from the LS outcome that it is making progress.","The decent score for the crisis-ridden party is seen as its revival, as it comes with appreciable performance in the north and the northeast.

For years, PM Modi has taken a stand against rewdis. Even in the run-up to polls, ‘Modi ki Guarantee’, BJP’s manifesto, stayed clear of promises of assured pension for govt staff or restoration of rail concessions for seniors. This contrasted with Congress ’s moves to announce annual doles of Rs 1 lakh for women and education and farm loan waivers.Even after Tuesday’s result, which points to Modi for the first time leading a govt without an absolute majority, it is not as if there will be a U-turn. After all, Modi had refused to give free electricity as Gujarat CM. However, the reluctance to open purse strings is expected to be far less, more so because demands are going to rise from voters, NDA allies.The approach will remain calibrated. So, BJP and its allies, while steering clear of guaranteeing MSP for farmers or reworking the formula, will be more generous in increasing the price. Besides, the Centre, which was reluctant to increase the PM-KISAN annual payout from Rs 6,000 announced five years ago, will be more open to it.Ahead of polls, Modi govt focused on filling up vacancies in govt. That’s something that is expected to get a fillip given that jobs have been a key poll issue. The Union Budget, which is expected in mid-July, will lay out the roadmap.","Even in the run-up to polls, ‘Modi ki Guarantee’, BJP’s manifesto, stayed clear of promises of assured pension for govt staff.

When, contrary to many pundits’ and its own expectations, Congress lost late-2023 assembly polls in the heartland, two things didn’t happen. One, Rahul Gandhi didn’t lose his temper. Two, he disagreed with party veterans like Ashok Gehlot who said BJP won by polarising voters. He had pointed out that in Rajasthan, for example, Congress vote share (40%) was just 2 percentage points behind BJP’s (42%). That’s not a sign of polarisation, Gandhi had said, that’s a sign of poor communication.Four months later, that cool-headed analysis seems to have paid off. Gandhi had told Congress seniors that an Ayodhya-focussed BJP can be confronted, with a good agenda backed by better campaign .The 2024 general elections did see Congress run a far better campaign – fronted by a calm, collected Rahul Gandhi. The change seems to have happened as he walked those miles, crisscrossing India during his Bharat Jodo Yatra.The 2024 Congress story is a story of Rahul Gandhi’s evolution. The new Gandhi didn’t let Congress’s poor Lok Sabha numbers in 2014 and 2019 demoralise him. He didn’t let December 2023’s heartland losses break his heart. He didn’t let an aggressive Narendra Modi intimidate him. His party was in blue funk in December 2023. Congress’s 2024 strategy was predicated on wins in MP and Chhattisgarh and a close fight in Rajasthan. Anticipation of good results had even led to Congress deferring the orga nisational restructuring by a year, and the defeats saddled it with serious holes in management of states close to polls.But Rahul rallied his troops, ordered fresh strategising, and worked on a manifesto that went into the heart of the Congress’ UPA-era agenda of welfare-jobs-growth. If the manifesto struck a chord with voters, Congress owes much to Gandhi. He has been at the forefront of a “guarantees” based welfare policy and caste outreach, repeatedly arguing this was the only way to take on a no-holds-barred campaign of polarisation by BJP.For Gandhi and the party, the stakes were clear. The Modi machine billed this general as the ticket to Modi’s place in history. There was huge asymmetry in resources between Congress and BJP, blanket media coverage of Modi, arrests of opposition leaders, and income-tax action on Congress bank accounts. Post Ayodhya consecration, it looked like a one-party election.Then came the poll schedule. A two-month, seven phase election seemed to favour Modi, who could campaign across the country, backed by a party flush with funds.For Congress, the much talked about existential crisis seemed finally here.Except for Rahul Gandhi. He persevered, held strategy sessions, and sharpened his ideas. The key idea: maximise gains in south, pick up seats in the north, and try breaking new ground in states that had gone barren after the advent of Modi. Seats Congress has won in the North — UP, Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab — are a testament to a resilience that none but Gandhi believed in.It was a methodical appro ach. Few in the party wanted a East-West Bharat Jodo Yatra after the December state defeats, but the Gandhi scion had a plan. Strategists picked 100-plus districts and seats where they thought Congress stood a decent chance in general elections. Gandhi covered 110 districts across 15 states in 62 days. The joint shows with INDIA allies became a forerunner for a campaign of unity.The approach was pragmatic. At the high table of Congress planning, Kharge and Gandhi were unanimous that the party had to strike compromises and ensure that the antiBJP alliance held firm. Congress contested 326 seats, the lowest in LS election history.This was premised on one belief Rahul Gandhi had – that Modi had to be opposed and that the opposition can’t be a passive player or an occasional right-wing drumbeater out of fear of popular backlash, or stay on right side of what Congress sees as a vindictive prosecution machinery.This was Gandhi’s strategy from Day 1 of the first Modi sarkar. He took a 55-day sabbatical to force Congress to toe his line. That led to public agitations against amendments to the Land Acquisition Act. That also made him one of the key players in getting Lalu Prasad to accept his nemesis Nitish as the face of the “mahagatbandhan’ that humbled BJP in Bihar in late 2015. There were a string of disappointments, especially the Pulwama-influenced 2019 elections. But later, working as the backroom strategist after Kharge’s elevation as party chief, he unfurled the Yatras and the agenda of pro-poor outreach and “mohabbat ki dukaan”. In these polls, Gandhi’s sharply ideological line paid dividends. Broken up opposition parties like Uddhav Sena and Sharad Pawar NCP, parties targeted by probe agencies, RJD, AAP and JMM, agreed to take Gandhi’s line – that standing for secularism, civil rights and the Constitution was the only counter in a Modi-dominated, Hindutva-laden political atmosphere. And INDIA’s campaign had the unmistakable imprint of Rahul Gandhi.Caste census emerged from this thinking as a stick to beat BJP with, and Opposition targeted votes of three pan-India groups – Dalits, Muslims and OBCs. Inside his own par ty, Gandhi’s “radical” positioning on secularism and reservations was doubted by many old timers schooled in centrist politics. But he pressed on.He made mistakes. It was no surprise that when his “chowkidar chor hai” campaign backfired in 2019, he was the only one surprised in Congress. Others had foreseen the disaster the shrill pitch was inviting, given Pulwama and Balakot. His other mistakes: Rafale fizzled out during the 2019 campaign, and Pegasus petered out during Modi’s second term. Many asked him to be pragmatic. Not all govt transgressions and scandals, no matter how serious, resonated with the public, especially when BJP had systemic hegemony under a popular leader.Reassessing, this time he continued his focus on Modi, but attacked him on governance “failures” – jobs, prices, unequal growth, small business ‘distress’, and social justice. National security, especially after Galwan, was a big issue for Gandhi, but the party didn’t highlight in its campaign. The “electoral bonds scam” was widely used, but only as a mood enhancer around the “panch nyay” hype.The smart use of the campaigning trio of Kharge, Gandhi and Priyanka helped Congress match BJP’s firepower. Between them, they addressed 335 rallies and events.But ultimately, it boiled down to communication with voters. By general reckoning, and with even rivals tipping their hat, Congress was at its smartest in the publicity game –short videos, wit over anger and outrage, targeting Modi on manifesto issues. They reminded many of the 2004 “aam aadmi” campaign. Door knocks, press conferences, nukkad sabhas were used for targeting voters at block and sub-district level. Gandhi’s own YouTube channel notched 35 crore views in 28 days till mid-May.2024’s will go down as a rare election in contemporary times when a party fought an election on its manifesto, even delivering it to every household in a constituency.It showed that voters can reward simple promises targeting basic needs even in times of polarisation and cult-style campaigns.It showed this time Rahul Gandhi, fighting an aggressive right, had got in right.","The 2024 general elections did see Congress run a far better campaign – fronted by a calm, collected Rahul Gandhi. The change seems to have happened as he walked those miles, crisscrossing India during his Bharat Jodo Yatra.
