'Yechury saw BJP and RSS as danger to the country': Rahul Gandhi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/that-was-the-last-time-i-saw-my-friend-rahul-gandhi-remembers-sitaram-yechury/articleshow/113767258.cms,"In memory of Sitaram Yechury Ji | Condolence Meeting | Talkatora Stadium, New Delhi

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi , while speaking at a condolence meeting for late CPM leader Sitaram Yechury recalled Yechury's concerns about the state of the country under BJP and RSS Rahul Gandhi said whenever Yechury discussed the BJP and RSS, it wasn’t about specific actions, but rather a broader warning. Rahul said, “Whenever he would speak to me about the BJP and RSS, he would not say that they were doing this and that, he would say that look, this is a danger to the country.What they are doing to our institutions, what they are doing to our structure, what they are doing to our education system is going to destroy India.""Rahul Gandhi paid a heartfelt tribute to Yechury, whom he described as a man of great integrity and conviction. ""He was a person you could trust, someone you were 100% sure wasn’t compromised in today’s political environment. Whatever he did, he always did it in the interest of the country. Maybe my brothers on the Left might not like it, but every time his starting point was India, and after that came his political ideology and convictions,” said Gandhi.Gandhi further reminisced about his long association with Yechury, noting how despite their ideological differences, Yechury had a unique ability to understand opposing viewpoints. ""I observed him carefully, and what I found was a person who was flexible, who listened, and despite being on the opposite end of the ideological spectrum, he had the ability to understand where we were coming from. He also allowed us to understand where he was coming from,"" Gandhi noted, calling Yechury a “bridge” between the Congress party and other parties in theINDIA alliance .The Congress leader emphasised Yechury's behind-the-scenes role in keeping political alliances intact. ""There are people who are visible and upfront, and then there is the glue that holds the structure together. Sitaram Yechury was that glue,"" he said, referring to Yechury’s role in the INDIA and UPA coalitions.On a personal note, Rahul Gandhi shared memories of Yechury's habit of smoking cigarettes, something Yechury was never able to quit. ""I always noticed how stress was countered with a cigarette, and I used to tell him, ‘Yechury Ji, why don’t you get rid of this?’ That, I think, was the only habit he couldn’t let go of,"" Gandhi said with a smile.In an emotional moment, Gandhi recounted Yechury's reluctance to go to the hospital during their last meeting. ""That was the last time I saw my friend,"" he said, recalling how he had insisted Yechury go to the hospital after observing him cough.Rahul Gandhi also reflected on the profound loss Yechury endured when his son passed away. He admitted that during their conversation, he was left speechless, unsure of what to say. ""I called him, but I didn’t know what to say. When I met him a few days later, the same tough, brave Yechury Ji was back,"" Gandhi said.","Rahul Gandhi paid a heartfelt tribute to Yechury, whom he described as a man of great integrity and conviction.

Zoon to zyeun: How Iltija's PDP slogan has been adopted by NC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/zoon-to-zyeun-how-iltijas-pdp-slogan-has-been-adopted-by-nc/articleshow/113776395.cms,"Imitation is the best form of flattery, says PDP candidate Iltija Mufti (PTI photo)

SRINAGAR: With political parties and workers unleashed after a long wait of 10 years, the Kashmir poll campaign struck a tone, harsh and partisan. But it also witnessed a tune so captivating that it acquired a universal appeal.The reverberating chants of ""zyeun ho zyeun ho, albain zyeun ho"" from a hall of packed supporters of National Conference candidate Hilal Akbar Lone and the social media post of party mascot Omar Abdullah with his inked finger and same caption, could be called a tribute to arch-rival and PDP functionary Iltija Mufti - who coined and popularised the slogan.'Albain' is the NC symbol 'plough'.The ""zoon ho zoon ho, PDP zoon ho"" that the Mufti heir apparent has personally led the crowds to chant started off as an irritant for rivals, moved to becoming an object of derision for critics, but ended up being adopted by the rivals in the last stretch. Clearly, it was too catchy and inspiring to have remained copyrighted.Iltija has claimed victory. ""Imitation is the best form of flattery,"" she told TOI, as she reacted to the deluge of NC chants of her coinage by dubbing the rivals as ""copycat monkeys"". When the assembly contest started a couple of months ago, Iltija was out front firing up the workers with a slogan that, riding on its pithiness and rhythm, acquired a life of its own.Aided by social media posts and WhatsApp forwards, it settled on the lips like nursery rhymes do with children.It was amusing to find random passersby humming it on the streets of Kashmir for no rhyme or reason.But delivered as a full-throated slogan, led by Iltija herself, it gave a disproportionate presence to a visibly shrinking PDP, widely viewed as fighting for its survival. ""PDP has been splintered into pieces and we are at our weakest. Yet, our campaign is way more energetic, so much so that others are copying us,"" she said.The crucial bit was that it stoked an unending parallel discussion on Kashmiri social media. After all, ""zoon"" is ""moon"", while ""Zyeun"" is ""win"".Iltija, who grew up in Delhi and abroad, was mocked for her ""feeble acquaintance"" with the native language.""They are mocking my Kashmiri,"" she chuckled, unaffected.Poet Ayaz Nazki feels the mispronunciation by Iltija made it a convenient tool for NC to show her up, a reason why it has been taken up by the rival. ""There is no other reason,"" he laughed.And the Mufti girl improvised. Soon, the ""zoo"" became ""zeu"", as she tried to get the phonetics in place.The chants only became louder and lustier at PDP rallies, where workers danced with energy and stomped the ground to welcome a party star or candidate.The crowd that witnessed the reception of party candidate Syed Aga Muntazir and functionary Waheed Parra in Sholipura, Budgam, last week were visibly enchanted.With PDP finding competition from NC even on the slogan it coined, the political fight has only got that bit more intense in the home stretch and people are waiting with bated breath for the results on an election long delayed and keenly fought. But Iltija has already delivered a ""zyeun"" that few can deny.","PDP functionary Iltija Mufti coined and popularised the slogan 'zyeun ho, albain zyeunho' She has claimed victory.

NEW DELHI: Samajwadi Party is set to have two front seats in Lok Sabha , in what will give it the chance to accommodate another member besides party chief Akhilesh Yadav Congress , meanwhile, will have four front seats and DMK one in the 18th Lok Sabha.Congress front row will be led by leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi , and comprise deputy Gaurav Gogoi, senior-most House member Kodikunnil Suresh, and AICC general secretary and Rahul's confidant KC Venugopal.But it is SP bench that is bound to elicit interest by way of its second MP to share the prime space with Akhilesh. During two short sessions held after the election, with permanent places still to be allocated to the members, the SP chief has seated Faizabad MP Awadhesh Prasad next to him.The choice has been politically significant as Faizabad comprises temple town Ayodhya, where SP vanquished BJP and delivered it a psychological blow. Its implication is amplified by the fact that Prasad is a veteran Dalit face who was fielded from a general seat, where he overcame BJP's known local face identified with Hindutva.With SP looking to increase its reach among the Dalit voters of UP, rendered uncommitted by the collapse of BSP, Prasad is viewed as the magnet to woo the vast populace.During the LS sessions, the large and vocal Samajwadi contingent and Congress mascot Rahul repeatedly held up Prasad to rile BJP, even as the veteran himself spared no opportunity to get under the skin of the ruling benches. A section of opposition is also pushing him for deputy speakership, with demand that Modi govt hold election to the prestigious, if ceremonial, post.INDIA bloc cobbled during 2024 parliamentary polls returned with a strength of 240 MPs, including TMC which too is expected to get front row seats besides the seven allocated to Congress, SP and DMK.Sources said that the seating arrangement is still being discussed, as the Speaker's office has sought names of MPs for individual seats across rows allocated to the opposition.","Samajwadi Party is set to have two front seats in Lok Sabha.
