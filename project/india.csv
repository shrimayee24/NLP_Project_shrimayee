NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday turned the tables on a married woman, who sought cancellation of anticipatory bail to a man accused of raping her on promise of marriage, by warning her she might be liable for prosecution for having a physical relationship with a man other than her husband during subsistence of her marriage.When the woman's counsel argued that the man had continued to engage in a sexual relationship with his client on the false promise of marriage, a bench of Justices M M Sundresh and N Kotiswar Singh said, ""You are a married woman with two children. You are a mature person, and you understand the relationship you were getting into outside the marriage.""When the advocate said that she was called many times to hotels and rest houses by the man for sex on the pretext of marriage, the bench asked, ""Why did you go to the hotels repeatedly at his beckoning? You very well understand that you also have committed an offence by having a sexual relationship outside the marriage.""The bench said Patna high court was right in granting anticipatory bail to Ankit Barnwal and dismissed the plea of the woman. The trial court had refused anticipatory bail to Barnwal, who had sought relief after the woman registered a rape complaint against him.The married woman and Barnwal had been in a relationship after knowing each other through social media in 2016. The woman had alleged that at the behest and pressure of Barnwal, she had sought divorce from her husband, which was granted by a family court on March 6.Within a fortnight of getting the divorce she allegedly asked Barnwal to marry her but he refused. She then lodged a complaint with Bihar police accusing him of sexually exploiting her in the false promise of marriage.The HC had granted anticipatory bail to Barnwal on finding from record that he had not indulged in any sexual activity with her after her divorce from her husband.","A married woman sought cancellation of anticipatory bail to a man accused of raping her on promise of marriage.

BJD activists clash with police over Balasore incident

BHUBANESWAR/BALASORE: Minutes before a 20-year-old college student set herself ablaze on July 12, she was allegedly coerced by her college principal to withdraw a sexual harassment complaint against a senior faculty member and apologise to the accused, according to a police complaint filed by her family.FIR says the student was summoned to the principal’s office between 12 and 12.30 pm. She left the room and by 12.40 pm had doused herself in petrol and set herself on fire. Her cousin, who filed the complaint, alleged that the principal warned her, “You won’t be able to show your face to anyone. You’ll be forced to end your life if you don’t withdraw the complaint.”Both the accused teacher and the principal were suspended and arrested. The crime branch has taken over the probe amid growing questions about how the student procured petrol within 10 minutes of leaving the principal’s office.Both the accused teacher and the principal were suspended and arrested. Odisha police’s crime branch has taken over the investigation amid growing questions about how the student procured petrol within 10 minutes of leaving the principal’s office.Investigators are probing whether anyone helped her.The student suffered burns on over 90% of her body and had inhaled flames, smoke, and petrol vapours that damaged her lungs, kidneys, and heart. She died late July 14 at AIIMS Bhubaneswar.Her death has become a flashpoint for public anger over institutional apathy and women’s safety in Odisha.BJD and Congress dismissed the crime branch probe as superficial and renewed calls for a judicial inquiry. “Crime branch is part of same system that failed her,” said former law minister and senior BJD member Pratap Jena.Congress MP Rahul Gandhi spoke to the student’s father and pledged full support. The party plans to raise the matter in Parliament during upcoming monsoon session.

Calcutta high court to Centre: Explain sudden raids against Bengali-speakers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/calcutta-high-court-to-centre-explain-sudden-raids-against-bengali-speakers/articleshow/122597837.cms,"Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee leads a TMC rally in Kolkata Wednesday to protest the ‘targeting’ of Bengali-speaking people in BJP states

KOLKATA: Calcutta high court asked the Union government on Wednesday to file an affidavit explaining the rationale behind the ""sudden"" countrywide raids in June targeting Bengali-speaking people as potentially illegal Bangladeshi migrants.""What were the reasons? Was this pre-planned?"" a division bench of Justices Tapabrata Chakraborty and Reetobroto Kumar Mitra said while hearing multiple habeas corpus petitions on the allegedly illegal detention of Bengali-speaking migrants in Odisha and six people being ""pushed into Bangladesh"".""Let these issues be cleared. Else, it will send out a wrong message. This could be a wrongful act. Allegations have been made that people are being illegally deported to Bangladesh just because they speak Bengali,"" it said.HC also sought affidavits from the Bengal government and Delhi Police over the deportation of a family of three from Birbhum to Bangladesh.State's senior counsel Kalyan Bandyopadhyay said speaking Bengali couldn't be grounds for suspicion that the person is an illegal immigrant. ""You can't detain and deport anyone for speaking Bengali. There is a procedure,"" he said, seeking to know how many such people had been held or deported.Delhi Police's counsel Dhiraj Trivedi said nobody had been deported for speaking Bengali. ""Around 165 people in Kashmir, including some who spoke Bengali, had been arrested after the terrorist strike on tourists in Pahalgam, but everyone was released.""The Centre's counsel, Asoke Chakraborty, wondered whether a writ of habeas corpus could be filed after a deportation order had been issued. There was also an argument over identical habeas corpus petitions being filed in both Delhi and Kolkata. Petitioners' counsel Raghunath Chakraborty said the kin of those deported had no knowledge of the case pending in Delhi HC.""Don't try to play tricks. Was it not your duty to ascertain whether they had earlier moved any other court? Do you think our orders are just scraps of paper? What sort of conduct is this?"" Justice Chakraborty responded.",HC also sought affidavits from the Bengal government and Delhi Police over the deportation of a family of three from Birbhum to Bangladesh.

SRINAGAR: Leader of opposition in Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi , and Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday, demanding the restoration of statehood to Jammu & Kashmir by bringing a bill in the monsoon session of Parliament.They also urged the Centre to grant constitutional safeguards under the Sixth Schedule to the Union territory of Ladakh to “address the cultural, developmental, and political aspirations of the people of Ladakh, while safeguarding their rights, land, and identity”.J&K CM Omar Abdullah welcomed the development. “We had been waiting for the day when the opposition would raise our voice in Parliament,” he said.Abdullah said the restoration of statehood is not an unusual demand, reminding that the Centre has repeatedly promised, inside and outside Parliament, in Supreme Court, and at public platforms, to restore J&K’s statehood “at an appropriate time.”However, PDP functionary and former minister Naeem Akhtar opined that there is not much reason for optimism, given the sharp divide between the Centre and the opposition on every issue. But he added, “The return of statehood would bring some relief.”National conference chief Farooq Abdullah said he would react only after the government introduces such a bill in Parliament.Ladakh MP Haji Hanifa Jan also welcomed the Congress move. He told TOI that jobs are a major concern in Ladakh. “But more than that we want the restoration of democracy, and safeguards for our culture and identity.
