Slow Traffic, Then Sudden Fireball: CCTV Captures The Delhi Red Fort Blast That Killed At Least 10

SRINAGAR: It took a doctor-cop to catch a “white-collar” terrorist network of doctors. When Jaish-e-Mohammed posters appeared overnight on Oct 19 across Nowgam-Bunpora in Srinagar, warning security forces of “dire consequences”, most residents brushed it off as a ghost from Kashmir’s violent past. For Srinagar SSP Dr GV Sundeep Chakravarthy, the signs were too deliberate — and too dangerous — to ignore.By dawn, he had ordered a case under UAPA, Explosive Substances Act, and Arms Act at Nowgam police station. CCTV footage combed frame by frame revealed three men. They were detained. Interrogation led to one name — Moulvi Irfan Ahmad of Shopian, who had led prayers at Nowgam mosque since 2020.Police teams moved fast. Ahmad’s Shopian home was searched. Another residence in Nowgam was examined. Digital footprints traced from his communications pointed to operatives beyond J&K — connections stretching into Haryana and UP.A team was dispatched. In coordinated follow-up action, police took custody of Muzammil Ahmad Ganaie, a doctor from Pulwama working in a Faridabad medical college and allegedly linked to the Jaish network. What had begun as an inquiry into wall posters turned into the exposure of a sophisticated cross-state, “white-collar” module.Three Nowgam residents were also held.A senior officer called the effort “a thorough forward-and-backward investigation that mapped every link in the chain”. “It was a good investigative effort that led to the arrest of doctors based in UP and Haryana. During questioning, more links were identified, which led to seizures, including IED-making material,” the officer said.For Chakravarthy, the 2014-batch IPS officer, this was another chapter in a career defined by frontline counterterror operations. Born in Kallur in Andhra Pradesh’s Kurnool, son of retired govt medical officer Dr GV Rama Gopal Rao and health department official PC Rangamma, he studied medicine at Kurnool Medical College and graduated in 2010. He served there briefly as a doctor before trading the stethoscope for the service revolver.On Aug 14, he received his sixth President’s Police Medal for Gallantry for his role in multiple antiterrorism operations in J&K. He took charge as SSP Srinagar on Apr 21 this year. The poster probe now stands as one of his most intricate investigations — one that allegedly peeled back layers of radicalisation and revealed an unlikely alliance of a moulvi, medics, and modules.","Jaish-e-Mohammed posters appeared overnight on Oct 19 across Nowgam-Bunpora in Srinagar.

CHANDIGARH: Punjab and Haryana high court has refused to hand over the investigation into the suicide of senior Haryana IPS officer Y Puran Kumar to CBI.""There does not appear any unnecessary delay or laxity in the investigation of the case to date.

Only 3 opposition members in 31-MP JPC on 3 bills to oust mantris,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/only-3-opposition-members-in-31-mp-jpc-on-3-bills-to-oust-mantris/articleshow/125283923.cms,"BJP MP Aparajita Sarangi (File photo)

Most parties refused to join panelNEW DELHI: Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla on Wednesday constituted a parliamentary committee to scrutinise three bills seeking removal of PM, CMs and ministers if they are under arrest for 30 consecutive days on serious criminal charges, with only three opposition members being part of the 31-MP panel after most opposition parties refused to join as a mark of protest against the proposed laws.Second-term BJP MP Aparajita Sarangi will head the joint parliamentary committee which has 21 members from Lok Sabha and 10 from Rajya Sabha.It includes 15 BJP MPs, including Ravi Shankar Prasad, Bhartruhari Mahtab and Anurag Thakur, 11 from its allies such as TDP, JDU, LJP(RV), Shiv Sena, NCP and AIADMK, and three opposition MPs in Supriya Sule of NCP-SP, Asaduddin Owaisi of AIMIM and Harsimrat Kaur Badal of Shiromani Akali Dal.Others members are S Niranjan Reddy of YSR Congress, a party unaffiliated to either the governing NDA or opposition but which has often backed govt in Parliament, & nominated MP Sudha Murty.The committee has been constituted following an unusually long delay as the opposition INDIA bloc, barring NCP-SP, after informal deliberation decided to be not part of the panel, leading to a fresh search.Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju and the speaker had reached out to Congress and other opposition parties.While Congress did weigh both the choices, it finally decided to join its regional allies in keeping away from the committee in a show of opposition unity. Congress and several other regional parties like TMC and DMK have termed the proposed laws as against the Constitution and federalism, and aimed at ""destabilising"" state govts run by opposition parties.Senior Congress MP Manickam Tagore was quick to slam the panel as ""not a Joint Parliamentary Committee - it's a JPC of BJP & its B-Team"", noting that over 340 MPs of the INDIA bloc are boycotting it. ""This JPC is nothing but a rubber stamp for Modi's unconstitutional agenda... 340 MPs have boycotted because this govt formed the JPC without consensus or parliamentary ethics,"" he said.Home minister Amit Shah had introduced the Constitution (One Hundred And Thirtieth Amendment) Bill 2025, the Government of Union Territories (Amendment) Bill 2025; and the J&K Reorganisation (Amendment) Bill 2025 in LS on Aug 20, and the House decided to send them to a parliamentary committee on his request.Its introduction in LS and RS the next day witnessed fierce protests from opposition MPs who tore copies of bills & demanded the proposed laws be withdrawn. The bills have proposed that if PM, Union ministers or CMs are arrested or detained in custody for 30 consecutive days for offences that attract a jail term of at least five years, they will lose their position on the 31st day.","Most parties refused to join panel.
