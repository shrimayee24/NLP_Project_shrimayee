Telangana HC slams SI for interfering in civil disputes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/telangana-hc-slams-si-for-interfering-in-civil-disputes/articleshow/122355409.cms,"



HYDERABAD: The Telangana High Court reprimanded the cops for involving themselves in civil disputes and harassing individuals under the guise of settling these disputes in police stations. On Wednesday, the High Court criticised the Sub-Inspector of Chintapalli police station, Nalgonda district, for allegedly involving himself in a civil dispute concerning a 32-acre land and harassing individuals to settle the matter, as well as conducting a survey of the disputed land.While issuing notices to the DGP Telangana, Principal Secretary Home, SP Nalgonda, and DSP Devarakonda, Justice T Vinod Kumar also ordered the SI to submit his explanation regarding the matter. The judge passed the orders while dealing with a petition filed by a television presenter and her associate, who alleged harassment from SI Rammorthy of Chintapalli police station.During the arguments, the judge remarked that the cops have turned police stations into 'addas' for civil and land settlements. The petitioner contended that they purchased the said land from a private person in 2017, but now the same person is forcing them to part with the land and harassing them using the cops. Despite permanent injunctions in the matter from a lower court in their favour and orders to provide police protection to them, the local cops have been ignoring the court orders and further harassing them, the petitioners claimed. The matter is posted for further hearing in four weeks.","The High Court criticised the Sub-Inspector of Chintapalli police station, Nalgonda district, for allegedly involving himself in a civil dispute concerning a 32-acre land.
