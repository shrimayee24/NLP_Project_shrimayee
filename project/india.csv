NEW DELHI: In his maiden address after taking over as BJP national president, Nitin Nabin on Tuesday asked party workers to mount a fight to “protect” the centres and legacy of Sanatan faith, saying political parties opposed to ‘deepam’ tradition in Madurai or existence of Ram Setu should have no space in politics.Nabin, whose elevation at 45 years of age is being seen as a generational shift in BJP, called Prime Minister Narendra Modi an inspiration and urged the youth to heed his call for joining active politics by saying “keeping a distance is no solution”. Youth should treat politics as a marathon and not a 100-metre sprint and prioritise stamina over speed, he said, adding that BJP’s “watch tower” is vigilant enough to identify their talent.Nabin’s unopposed election as the 12th BJP president was announced at a function at the party headquarters in New Delhi in the presence of PM Modi and several former party chiefs, including JP Nadda, Amit Shah, Rajnath Singh and Nitin Gadkari.Shah congratulated Nabin, expressing confidence that his tenure as BJP president under Modi’s guidance will infuse new energy and speed in the party’s dedicated work towards national interest and people’s welfare.The fifth-term MLA and first person from Bihar to head BJP’s organisation ticked off the party’s twin planks of Hindutva and nationalism in his inaugural address, which will be pored over by its rank and file, a large number of whom might not have heard much of him before he was appointed BJP working president last month. DMK ’s strident opposition to bid by Hindu groups to light a ‘deepam’ at a hilltop considered sacred by them was seized by BJP to mount a political challenge as the state heads to assembly polls.Nabin also flagged the decision by DMK and its allies to move a motion for removal of Madras high court Judge GR Swaminathan, who had decided in favour of Hindu groups, to target the parties. A division bench had later rejected state govt’s challenge to the verdict. He also voiced the party’s concerns over infiltration, which is a key part of its agenda in poll-bound Bengal and Assam.","Nitin Nabin, 45, is the 12th BJP president.

Nationalism, Sanatan, Demographic Change: Nitin Nabin Draws Red Line In First Speech As BJP Chief

(With ANI inputs)

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Tuesday took a swipe after Nitin Nabin formally took charge as the BJP's new national president without a leadership contest and also took a dig at Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Gyanesh Kumar, whom the largest opposition party has been attacking, alleging irregularities in elections.“Where is the election? Why do you even call it an election? You announce the president first and then say there will be an election, and then there is no election,” Pawan Khera, head of the Congress’ media and publicity department, said at a press conference.Attacking the CEC, Khera added with a quip, “Gyanesh Kumar wants to resign in protest; he has no role, he can’t even influence, he can’t even manipulate anything.”Commenting on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s remark that Nitin Nabin is his “boss” in party matters, Khera remarked, “They can keep playing games among themselves. Sometimes Mohan Bhagwat becomes someone’s boss, sometimes Modi becomes someone’s boss. We don’t care about the tears of seers and are playing boss-boss.”“Is Bigg Boss game being played here? What is this? The biggest boss of Hindu dharma is shedding tears and they are busy playing Bigg Boss,” he added.Khera’s comments referred to the controversy over authorities allegedly preventing Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati from taking a holy dip in the Ganga at Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh. Mohan Bhagwat is the head of the RSS, the ideological parent of the ruling BJP.Another Congress leader, Lok Sabha MP Manickam Tagore, pointed out that the grand old party conducted a leadership contest between Mallikarjun Kharge and Shashi Tharoor in 2022, in which Kharge won and succeeded Sonia Gandhi as the Congress’ national president.“We hold elections in the Congress. Mallikarjun Kharge and Shashi Tharoor were candidates, and voting took place. This is called democracy. PM Modi and [Union Home Minister] Amit Shah want to take over the role of all the workers… BJP is an authoritative party and moving towards dictatorship… Even the RSS is stunned to see this,” Tagore said.Congress ally Rashtriya Janata Dal also criticised the BJP, with RJD MP Manoj Jha saying, ""Don’t call it an election... an election is only called when there are two or more choices. Nevertheless, he has become the national president, and I extend my best wishes to him.""Nitin Nabin, born in the same year (1980) as the saffron party, is the youngest and 12th president of the saffron party. Hailing from Bihar, he was appointed the national working president in December last year, signaling his eventual elevation to the top post.He succeeds Union health minister JP Nadda, who had been the BJP chief since January 2020, following Amit Shah.","The Congress took a swipe after Nitin Nabin formally took charge as the BJP's new national president without a leadership contest.
