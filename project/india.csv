He even said he would take a dip in the Yamuna in front of Delhiites.

Cleaning it is not rocket science. All the silt should be removed by machines, sewerage treatment plants should be built, water treatment plants should be built... Just like our Prime Minister Modi ji built the Sabarmati Riverfront, Yamuna Riverfront can be built in the same way. 11 years is a very long time,"" Verma said.""Arvind Kejriwal repeatedly said that he will clean the Yamuna, if I am not able to clean it then the people of Delhi should not vote for me. Arvind Kejriwal can never become CM again. All the ministers released on bail from Tihar are still accused, they can go to jail again tomorrow. So I want to tell the people of Delhi that please vote for a good government, the Bharatiya Janata Party, so that both the governments work together,"" Verma said further.The latest attack comes days after Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath targeted AAP and its leadership and accused it of turning the Yamuna River into a ""dirty drain"" and referred to it as a ""sin.""He questioned Kejriwal’s commitment to the river’s cleanliness, recalling his visit to the Sangam in Prayagraj for the ongoing Maha Kumbh.""I along with my ministers took a holy dip in the Sangam. I challenge Kejriwal to bathe in the Yamuna in Delhi with his ministers. He should answer if he has the moral courage,"" Yogi said.","Union minister Amit Shah reminded Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal of his promise to clean Yamuna and dared him to take his 'world-famous dip' in the river.

Karnataka high court: Victim's note cannot override cruelty charges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/karnataka-high-court-victims-note-cannot-override-cruelty-charges/articleshow/117567234.cms,"BENGALURU: Karnataka high court rejected a petition to quash a dowry death case despite the victim's suicide note not naming anyone.Justice M Nagaprasanna's verdict, on plea filed by a Bengaluru man and his parents, cited prima facie evidence of harassment. Court said the victim's final note cannot override substantive allegations of matrimonial cruelty . The victim was married on Oct 24, 2019. After living for about a year with her husband at their Bengaluru home, she died by suicide, following which her father filed a complaint on Oct 24, 2020.The man and his parents were booked under IPC Sections 498A and 304B , and Sections 3 & 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act. This led to police filing a chargesheet. The petitioners said victim's suicide note blamed herself. ""Neither offence under Section 498A nor 304B of IPC or offence under Dowry Prohibition Act are met,"" they argued.The complainant's counsel countered that her death was under mysterious circumstances and should have been registered as murder.Justice Nagaprasanna reviewed all available evidence and found that as per chargesheet victim was harassed for dowry of Rs 4-5 lakh and subjected to abusive comments about her appearance. The judge observed: ""Too much emphasis is laid on the death note of the complainant's daughter. SC considers those very issues and convicts or affirms conviction of the husband and family, notwithstanding the death note blaming none.""","Karnataka high court rejected a petition to quash a dowry death case despite the victim's suicide note not naming anyone.
