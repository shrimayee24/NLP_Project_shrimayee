My party made me go here and there a couple of times earlier, but this is not going to happen again. Who made me CM? It was the late Atal Bihari Vajpayee,"" Nitish said.His remarks come days after he blamed his close aide, Rajiv Ranjan alias Lallan Singh, for the break-up with the BJP, accusing the saffron party of trying to split the JD(U). Nitish’s confession came at a rally in Madhubani in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.""We had been together since the beginning. It was my party colleague sitting here who caused me to go astray,"" the JD(U) supremo said, pointing toward Lallan Singh.""We had fought them (RJD) together. He (Lallan) knows it well. He has been in the party for long and even served as its president. He, too, finally realised that they (RJD) were up to some mischief,"" he added.Lallan was then the national president of the JD(U), and he stepped down just a month before Kumar abruptly exited the INDIA bloc, which both leaders had helped form.Speculation had been rife that Lallan was made to resign due to perceptions that he had grown too close to the RJD, headed by Kumar's long-time rival, Lalu Prasad Yadav The JD(U) and BJP's alliance dates back to the 1990s. It first broke in 2013 over disagreements regarding the elevation of PM Modi, who was chief minister of Gujarat as the BJP’s prime ministerial candidate.Kumar later allied with RJD supremo Lalu Prasad, but that alliance lasted only until 2017, when he returned to the NDA fold.The alliance continued until 2022, when Kumar once again joined hands with the RJD-led Mahagathbandhan, vowing to defeat the BJP and accusing it of attempting to split his party.However, ahead of the Lok Sabha polls last year, Nitish returned to the NDA, abandoning the INDIA bloc that he had helped form by uniting parties opposed to the BJP.","Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Sunday attributed his previous switch from the BJP-led NDA to his party colleagues.

We want freedom of expression, which has not been allowed under the Congress in the past.""The student also referred to the Anandpur Sahib resolution , which he claimed the Congress mis-characterized as a separatist manifesto.

Special session of Punjab House today to discuss water release to Haryana,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/special-session-of-punjab-house-today-to-discuss-water-release-to-haryana/articleshow/120880057.cms,"This is a representational image

Will safeguard state’s waters, says Punjab Cong; SAD petitions PM

Poll Should Punjab consider negotiations with Haryana to resolve the water-sharing issue? No, stand firm on water rights. Yes, dialogue is essential.

CHANDIGARH: Punjab assembly will hold a special session Monday as the decades-old water-sharing dispute with Haryana reignited. The session follows Centre's directive for Punjab to release an additional 4,500 cusecs a day to Haryana from Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB) reservoirs for eight days.The move, adding to the existing 4,000 cusecs a day already flowing to Haryana, has drawn resistance from Punjab, which contends it has no surplus water to spare. State officials said Haryana has already exceeded its quota and current flow was allowed only on humanitarian grounds.Punjab boycotted a BBMB partner states meeting Saturday, protesting the short notice and asserting it will not engage further until the assembly session concludes. According to Punjab, BBMB regulations require a seven-day notice for special meetings. Two previous meetings were also held with just a day’s notice.The row comes ahead of the annual BBMB water allocation cycle beginning May 21. The dispute escalated after Centre, represented by Union home secretary Govind Mohan, sided with Haryana’s demand despite Punjab’s objections. On April 30, both state officials attended a BBMB meeting where the board ordered the release of 8,500 cusecs to Haryana.Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann convened an all-party meeting Friday, followed by the assembly session call. All political parties in Punjab expressed solidarity, although BJP politicians said Haryana had received additional water in the past, suggesting the current crisis was avoidable.In a parallel move, Haryana held its own all-party meeting, with unanimous backing for its position. Haryana CM Nayab Singh Saini claimed Punjab had agreed to the extra release, prompting Mann to call the statement “completely false and misleading” in a sharply worded letter, accusing BJP-led Union and Haryana govts of “bullying tactics against the people of Punjab”.Leader of opposition Partap Singh Bajwa said after a Congress legislature party meeting: “We are prepared. We will safeguard the state’s waters and interests,” adding the party would withhold its full strategy from the press. Despite a united front, Punjab’s political parties have a long record of trading blame over the state’s water disputes.SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal appealed to PM Narendra Modi to intervene, criticising AAP govt in Punjab. “The current rulers of the state are playing with fire by openly promising to release water to Haryana and Rajasthan,” he said. “Our CM Bhagwant Mann’s belated posturing is like shutting the door after the horse has bolted.”Of SAD’s three MLAs in the 117-member assembly, only Ganieve Kaur Majithia remains aligned with the party. AAP holds 93 seats, Congress 16, BJ, BSP 1, with one independent and one seat vacant ahead of the Ludhiana West bypolls.","The session follows Centre's directive for Punjab to release an additional 4,500 cusecs a day to Haryana.

Poll How important is it to conduct a caste census in India? Somewhat important Very important

NEW DELHI: Even as Congress claims PM Narendra Modi buckled under its pressure to reverse his earlier decision on enumerating caste, the party Sunday added a twist by releasing a 2021 govt answer in Parliament in which it had stated that it will not conduct a caste census in 2021 as a policy decision, and also quoting a Centre's affidavit beseeching Supreme Court not to order a caste census against the govt policy. The opposition party asked the PM if he will accept that he has taken a U-turn on the issue.To amplify its attacks on BJP, Congress has directed its state units to hold statewide rallies at the assembly level to showcase the role of Congress and Rahul Gandhi in making caste census a reality, with the directive that they should highlight that BJP has been against the idea. The party also asked its netas to intensify the demand for removal of 50% barrier on reservations and for implementation of quotas in private educational institutions.Home ministry told Lok Sabha on July 20, 2021, that govt had taken a policy decision not to enumerate caste in the census. Also, as per Congress, PM Modi government told SC on Sept 21, 2021: ""The exclusion of information regarding any other caste [outside of SCs and STs] from the purview of census [2021] is a conscious policy decision taken by the central govt.""Congress spokesman Jairam Ramesh said, ""Evidence abounds on Modi's sudden, complete, and desperate U-turn on the caste census... Will he explain to the people and Parliament the reasons for the change in govt's policy?""","Congress claims PM Narendra Modi buckled under its pressure to reverse his earlier decision on enumerating caste.
