Jharkhand moves contempt plea against Centre in SC for delay in appointing CJ,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jharkhand-moves-contempt-plea-against-centre-in-sc-for-delay-in-appointing-cj/articleshow/113506040.cms,"Centre's deliberate inaction violates

Article 216

: Jharkhand to SC

NEW DELHI: In a first, Jharkhand government has moved Supreme Court seeking contempt of court action against the Centre for its ""deliberate and wilful"" delay in implementing the SC collegium 's July 11 resolution recommending appointment of Justice M S Ramachandra Rao as chief justice of the state, reported.In its petition, the Hemant Soren govt said the state was without a chief justice for two months, since the retirement of Justice B R Sarangi on July 19.It said the SC's five-member collegium led by CJI D Y Chandrachud, anticipating the vacancy, had recommended to the Centre to transfer the Himachal Pradesh HC CJ to Jharkhand HC as its CJ.It said despite the passage of more than two months, the Union govt was deliberately sitting over the SC collegium's recommendation, a situation that displayed the Centre's complete disregard for the highest court's decisions.Jharkhand govt said Centre's deliberate inaction on the collegium resolution was also in violation of Article 216 of the Constitution, which says, ""Every high court shall consist of a chief justice and such other judges...""Constitutional courts are empowered to initiate contempt of court proceedings against anyone who wilfully disobeys or ignoresjudicial orders of such courts. However, it is to be seen whether SC collegium resolutions can be put on the same pedestal as judicial orders to attract provisions of the Contempt of Courts Act if the Union govt disagrees or delays implementation.Seeking to push swift implementation of the collegium's recommendations, retired SC judge Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul had warned Centre of contempt of court proceedings but refrained from acting on the caution.SC, through three judgments in the 1990s, made the collegium the sole arbiter in appointments of judges to the apex court and HCs but it has not spelt out the timeframe within which the recommendations are to be implemented. Moreover, while the Centre cannot refuse to comply with the collegium's decision, it can seek a review by flagging issues which it feels escaped the attention of the body or did not get adequate consideration.Information about Jharkhand moving a contempt petition against Centre was shared by CJI Chandrachud with attorney general R Venkataramani when the top law officer was requesting adjournment of Friday's hearing on a PIL by Harsh Vibhor Singh, who sought time-bound implementation of the collegium's recommendations for appointment & transfer of HC judges.The AG told the bench of CJI and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra he would provide details on appointment of CJs to HCs next week. SC asked the AG to renew the request for adjournment on Friday as the case was already listed.Apart from recommending transfer of Justice Rao from Himachal Pradesh high court to Jharkhand, the SC collegium on July 11 had passed a resolution for appointment of chief justices to seven HCs. However, the Centre cited certain ""sensitive material"" to request the collegium to reconsider certain recommendations.Based on the material, the collegium on Sept 17 had changed its proposals on appointment of CJs to three HCs - Himachal Pradesh (after the retirement of Justice Rajiv Shakdher), Madhya Pradesh, and Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh.","In a first, Jharkhand government has moved Supreme Court seeking contempt of court action against the Centre.

NEW DELHI: PM Modi on Wednesday accused Congress and its ally National Conference of toeing Islamabad's line after Pakistan defence minister Khwaja Asif recently endorsed NC's demand for restoration of Articles 370 and 35A.Referring to Asif's remarks made on a Pakistani TV channel, PM Modi told an election rally at Katra in Jammu region, ""There may not be enthusiasm in J&K about the Congress-National Conference alliance, but the neighbouring country is very enthusiastic about them.""""They (the alliance) have made it an election issue.Pakistan and the National Conference-Congress alliance are on the same page in J&K to restore Articles 370 and 35A,"" Asif said in an interview with Geo TV. He went on to say there was ""high chance"" of Congress-NC winning the polls and coming to office in the UT.Speaking at Katra, PM Modi said, ""Congress and NC want to implement Pakistan's agenda in Jammu & Kashmir. But we will not allow that here. No power in the world can bring back Article 370 in J&K,"" the PM said as he asserted that Pakistan itself has exposed the Congress-NC alliance.Home minister Amit Shah also hit out at Congress over Pakistan defence minister Khwaja Asif's endorsement of the demand for restoration of Articles 370 and 35A, saying that the Pakistan minister's remarks are evidence that the neighbouring country and Congress have the ""same intentions and agenda"".He said, ""Be it asking for proof of air strikes and surgical strikes against terrorists or saying objectionable things about Indian Army, the tune of Rahul Gandhi's Congress and Pakistan has always been the same and Congress has always been hand-in-glove with the anti-national forces.""While NC made restoration of Articles 370 and 35A its chief election plank, Congress, which had initially opposed their abro-gation, has not spelt out its current position.Shah and former I&B minister Anurag Thakur ridiculed the promise of restoration of the twin provisions which BJP has blamed for stoking secessionist tendencies.

BJP minister booked for calling Rahul Gandhi 'number one terrorist',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-minister-booked-for-calling-rahul-gandhi-number-one-terrorist/articleshow/113490186.cms,"NEW DELHI: An FIR has been lodged against Union minister Ravneet Singh Bittu for his alleged comments targeting Congress leader Rahul Gandhi regarding his statements made in the US about the Sikh community 's condition in India, police confirmed on Thursday. The complaint was filed by a Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee official.In his comments, Bittu said, “If those ‘manufacturing bombs’ were supporting him, he is the ‘number one terrorist’.” The Congress party condemned Bittu’s statement, describing it as “senseless.”The FIR, registered at High Grounds police station , includes charges under sections 353 (2) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita Act, which pertains to making or circulating false information, 192 (provoking riots), and 196 (promoting enmity between different groups).Bittu, who serves as minister of State for Railways, made headlines on Sunday after he labelled Rahul Gandhi a ""number one terrorist"" in response to Gandhi’s remarks about the condition of Sikhs in India. Bittu’s remarks followed Gandhi’s statements about Sikhs being limited in their ability to wear traditional symbols such as turbans and kadas or to visit Gurudwaras.In a video message, Bittu said, ""I want to tell Mallikarjun Kharge and every Congress worker that you can happily protest against me if this makes the Gandhi family happy. When Rahul Gandhi said something against Sikhs, he was supported by the biggest enemy of the country, Gurpatwant Singh Pannun , who is conducting a referendum for Khalistan. That person gave a statement in favour of Rahul Gandhi."" Clarifying his controversial remarks , Bittu said in a video message on Wednesday that his comments were in response to Congress's silence over Gurpatwant Singh Pannun’s support for Gandhi’s statements. Pannun, a Khalistani separatist and co-founder of the banned SFJ, had praised Gandhi’s remarks, leading Bittu to accuse the Congress party of aligning with Pannun.Bittu said, “When Rahul Gandhi said something against Sikhs, he was supported by the biggest enemy of the country, Gurpatwant Singh Pannun... Whatever Rahul Gandhi said about Sikhs, it was endorsed by the most dangerous terrorist. When you did not say this, then I said that it is clear that Mallikarjun Kharge and Congress leaders are standing with Pannun.”Meanwhile, regarding the FIR Bittu said that, he stands by his comments and is not afraid of police complaints.In response, Himachal Pradesh chief minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu criticised Bittu’s remarks, suggesting they were a ploy to attract attention and criticising BJP leadership for allowing such statements. Sukhu remarked, “The BJP is making their junior leaders make remarks against him (Rahul Gandhi)... National President JP Nadda should control such leaders.”Rahul Gandhi’s comments about the Sikh community, which he made during his US visit, sparked a political uproar. Pannun had supported Gandhi’s statements, further fuelling the controversy. The Congress party has since lodged additional complaints against three other NDA leaders for their remarks against Gandhi, with protests held in Delhi against Bittu and other BJP leaders .","The complaint was filed by a Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee official.

Also, three of the four Valley districts covered in Phase I — Pulwama, Shopian and Kulgam — saw a jump of around 2 to 12 percentage points in turnouts as compared to 2014 assembly poll.Overall, the people’s participation in J&K Phase I poll, at slightly over 61.1%, was better than the 60% polling witnessed in 2014 assembly poll and way higher than the corresponding 50.3% turnout in the same districts in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls .The polling was higher in all four Valley’s districts as compared to 2024 LS but slightly lower only in Anantnag when compared to 2014 assembly polls. As regards the three districts of Jammu region that voted — Kishtwar, Doda and Ramban — the polling was higher for all as compared to LS polls but a tad lower in respect of Doda and Ramban ACs, when compared to 2014 assembly polls.The turnout figures for Wednesday’s polling are still provisional. Also, an assembly constituency (AC) wise comparison between 2014 and current assembly elections would not be accurate as the constituencies were redrawn in 2022 as part of the delimitation exercise.Commenting on the improved turnout, chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar told TOI that the people of Jammy & Kashmir have proven right the Urdu couplet recited by him while announcing J&K polls on August 16, which, translated into English, means that “in the celebration of democracy, your (J&K people’s) participation will show the world the story of defeat of mala fide intentions (napaak iraadon ki shikast)”.A comparison of AC-wise turnouts between 2014 Lok Sabha polls and the current election shows thatKulgam AC , where six terrorists were killed in two separate encounters in July, recorded the highest surge of 28.5 percent age points (34.2% to 62.7%). In once terrorist-infested Anantnag, there was a jump of over 14 percentage points in turnout across both Dooru AC and Srigufwara-Bijbehara AC, 12.1 percentage points in Anantnag AC and 11.8 percentage points each in Anantnag West AC and Shangus-Anantnag East AC.Pulwama AC and Pampore AC in Pulwama district, where a terror attack on a CRPF convoy in Feb 2019 had killed 40 personnel, witnessed an improvement of 6-7 percentage points in turnout as compared to 2024 Lok Sabha polls, even as Tral AC saw a rise of 3 percentage points. Pahalgam AC showed the district’s highest jump at 13.6 percentage points.In terror-hit Shopian, Shopian AC and Zainapora AC saw a turnout increase of 14.4 and 13.2 percentage points respectively over the LS polls.In the Jammu region, Doda AC, Doda West AC and Bhadarwah AC in Doda district, where five soldiers were killed by terrorists in two separate incidents in July, respectively witnessed a 4.3, 6.6 and 4.2 percentage points increase in polling over LS elections. Banihal AC and Ramban AC in Ramban district recorded a surge of 12.3 and 2.9 percentage points respectively. In Kishtwar, Kishtwar AC and Inderwal AC clocked an over 13 percentage point rise each in polling as compared to Lok Sabha elections.","All 24 assembly constituencies and seven districts of J&K that went to polls on Wednesday recorded higher turnouts than in LS polls held barely four months back.

MUMBAI: Bombay high court Thursday said creative freedom and the freedom of expression could not be curtailed and the censor board could not refuse to certify a film just because there was an apprehension of a law and order problem.Expressing its displeasure with the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) for not taking a decision on the issuance of certificate to the Kangana Ranaut-starrer 'Emergency', a division bench of Justices B P Colabawalla and Firdosh Pooniwalla said, ""You have to take a decision one way or the other.You must have the courage to say this film cannot be released. At least then we will appreciate your courage and boldness. We don't want CBFC to sit on the fence."" The court ordered that a decision be taken by September 25.CBFC's counsel Abhinav Chandrachud had earlier told the court that the board's chairman had referred the movie to the revising committee for a final decision. He said there was an element of apprehension of public disorder.The court was hearing a petition filed by Zee Entertainment Enterprises, the producer of the movie, seeking direction to CBFC to issue certificate.The biographical drama, earlier scheduled for release on September 6, got caught in a controversy after Sikh organisations raised objections and accused the film of misrepresenting the community and historical facts.The court asked if CBFC thought people were so naive that they would believe everything shown in a movie. ""We don't see why people are so sensitive. Movies make fun of my community all the time. We don't say anything. We just laugh and move on,"" Justice Colabawalla said in a lighter vein.Appearing for the petitioner, senior counsel Venkatesh Dhond said CBFC was stalling just to buy time and ensure the movie was not released before October, when elections are to be held in Haryana.Questioning the political angle, the bench asked if the petitioner was claiming that the governing party was itself against Ranaut, who is co-producer of the film. ""The co-producer herself is a BJP MP. So you are saying her own party is against its member?"" the court asked. Dhond claimed that the governing party was willing to displease a sitting parliamentarian just to appease a particular section of society.",Bombay high court orders Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) to issue certificate to Kangana Ranaut-starrer 'Emergency' CBFC's counsel Abhinav Chandrachud had earlier told the court that the board's chairman had referred the movie to the revising committee for final decision.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113502679,imgsize-891959,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/113502679.jpg"

Senior leaders in the BJP, who have frequently paid visits to drum up support, have reiterated multiple times that there is no place for Article 370 in the Indian constitution.""This Article has become an old chapter of India’s history,"" Union minister Amit Shah said on Tuesday during a campaign trail.“I want to ask the NC-Congress how they can bring back Article 370. Let me clarify that neither terrorism nor Article 370 will return,” he added.Recently, this week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi hit the campaign trail by holding a rally in Doda, marking the first visit to the region by an Indian Prime minister in 42 years. The Prime Minister, in his rallies, accused the NC-Congress alliance of wanting to restore Article 370, which, he said, will never happen under the current government.Today's development also coincides with PM Modi's scheduled campaign rally in Srinagar and Katra, a day after the first phase of the Jammu and Kashmir assembly election saw a 59 percent voter turnout.“I look forward to being among the people of Jammu and Kashmir today. I will address a rally in Srinagar and Katra. Yesterday’s turnout has shown that the people of J&K are very enthusiastic about the elections and are keen to make the poll process vibrant. I will speak about our development agenda and seek people’s blessings,” PM Modi wrote on X.Meanwhile, while the National Conference has vowed to restore Article 370, the Congress has been completely silent on the issue and has not mentioned it in its manifesto. However, Congress has promised its commitment to restoring full statehood status to Jammu and Kashmir.","Pakistan's defence minister Khwaja Asif says Congress, National Conference party, and Pakistan are all on the same page when it comes to restoring Article 370 and 35A in Jammu and Kashmir. Union home minister lashed out at Pakistan defence minister's statement about Congress and JKNC's support.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113479239,imgsize-21750,width-400,resizemode-4/113479239.jpg"
