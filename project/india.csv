NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Parliamentary Board is set to convene on Sunday at the party headquarters in New Delhi to finalize the National Democratic Alliance’s (NDA) candidate for the upcoming Vice-Presidential election, scheduled for September 9.The meeting, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi , will include key leaders such as Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, and BJP President J.P. Nadda, among others. The NDA has authorized Modi and Nadda to select the candidate for this critical constitutional post, with the decision expected to be endorsed by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).The urgency to select a candidate follows the abrupt resignation of former Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar on July 21, 2025, citing health reasons, though speculations of political differences had surfaced. Sources indicate that the BJP is keen on choosing a candidate deeply rooted in the BJP-RSS ecosystem, with names like Gujarat Governor Acharya Devvrat, Karnataka Governor Thawarchand Gehlot, Sikkim Governor Om Mathur, and Jammu and Kashmir Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha being considered.Devvrat, a Jat community member, is a strong contender to appease the community, while Gehlot’s selection could bolster the BJP’s outreach to backward caste voters.The NDA, with its majority in the electoral college comprising Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha members, is poised for an easy victory if the election is contested. The opposition INDIA bloc may field a candidate, with discussions slated for August 18. Meanwhile, all NDA Chief Ministers and Deputy Chief Ministers have been summoned to Delhi on August 21 for the nomination filing, signaling a unified front. The decision on Sunday is expected to reflect strategic political calculations, balancing caste dynamics and RSS influence.","The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Parliamentary Board is set to convene on Sunday at the party headquarters in New Delhi.

BHOPAL: Congress removed Saturday 68 district presidents in Madhya Pradesh, appointing 71 new chiefs that include six sitting MLAs and eight former legislators. The overhaul is part of Rahul Gandhi's Sangathan Srajan Abhiyan (organisational rejuvenation campaign), launched two-and-a-half months ago in the state.Raghogarh MLA Jaivardhan Singh, son of former chief minister Digvijaya Singh, has been named district president for Guna, while Digvijaya's nephew Priyavrat Singh takes charge in Rajgarh.Only three incumbent district chiefs have retained their posts. All three are considered close to state Congress chief Jitu Patwari.Patwari said the appointments would strengthen the party against BJP, describing district chiefs as the ""backbone of the organisation"". He said: ""Under the guidance of Congress top leadership, the organisation rejuvenation campaign has now reached the stage of responsibilities within the party."" Congress claimed 70% of the new chiefs have experience in Youth Congress, NSUI or Seva Dal, with the team's average age between 45 and 50.Political observers, however, said senior functionaries Digvijaya Singh, Kamal Nath, Patwari and former PCC chief Arun Yadav ensured their supporters found place.Appointments allegedly reflect factional balance: Digvijaya loyalists Jaivardhan Singh, Priyavrat Singh and Vipin Wankhede; Kamal Nath loyalists Vishwanath Okhte, Saurabh Nati Sharma and Ravi Naik; Patwari's backers formed about 20% of the list, while Arun Yadav's supporters gained some slots in Nimar.Party insiders said district presidents will have authority to recommend candidates for the 2028 assembly elections. ""By instating their supporters, senior functionaries have ensured they can endorse their choice of candidates,"" a party member said, requesting anonymity.Congress, however, maintained that senior functionaries' recommendations were not entertained.",The overhaul is part of Rahul Gandhi's Sangathan Srajan Abhiyan (organisational rejuvenation campaign) The 71 new chiefs include six sitting MLAs and eight former legislators.

CHANDIGARH: Opposition parties in Punjab have urged the Election Commission to take action against AAP and its Punjab in-charge, Manish Sisodia, over a social media video where he allegedly tells party workers that AAP would resort to “saam, daam, dand, bhed… ladai, jhagda” to win the 2027 assembly election.Punjab BJP president Sunil Jakhar has written to the Chief Election Commissioner to file an FIR against Sisodia, disqualify him from future elections and bar him from giving speeches. Shiromani Akali Dal has demanded that AAP be barred from contesting elections in Punjab. The AAP leadership, however, says Sisodia’s words have been taken out of context and that the clip is being used to misrepresent his speech. The video is purportedly from a speech Sisodia gave at an AAP women’s wing leadership training programme in Mohali on Aug 13.""2027 ki chunav jitwane ke liye saam, daam, dand, bhed, sach, jhoot, question-answer, ladai-jhagda, jo karna padega karenge.

Whatever we have to do, we will do. Are you ready? With passion? Very good),” he purportedly says in the video.Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann and AAP Punjab president Aman Arora were present during Sisodia’s speech, and AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal had addressed the event virtually.An AAP politician told TOI that the “brief, one-minute video does not convey the full meaning or entire thought process” of what Sisodia was trying to communicate. “Ironically, the theme of the training programme was to prepare party workers to counter the very type of false propaganda that is now being spread via this clip. The address was part of an internal party meeting and was not livestreamed,” he said, suggesting that “someone recorded the video and edited this clip out of context”.The video has put Punjab politics on the boil, though. Punjab BJP president Sunil Jakhar accused Sisodia of openly advocating corrupt and violent practices to win the polls. On Saturday, he wrote to the CEC demanding an FIR against Sisodia, saying his words “clearly reveal AAP’s intent to undermine the democratic process”.“These statements amount to an open admission of intent to adopt corrupt practices, intimidate voters, spread enmity, and disturb public order in the state, thereby threatening the peace, development and prosperity of Punjab,” his letter claims. SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal shared the clip on social media, and urged EC to take “strong notice of Sisodia’s highly provocative statements and get his bail cancelled”. “AAP’s cat has finally been let out of the bag. The mask has been removed from their faces. To remain in power in Punjab in 2027, AAP’s deceptions, lies, false promises, and cheap tactics — including riots, violence, and the game of money — have all been shamelessly and openly admitted by their Delhi-based leader, Manish Sisodia,” Sukhbir Singh Badal claimed. “In view of this brazen admission, AAP must be debarred in Punjab to save this sensitive border state from a repeat of the dangerous past. I also urge strict and prompt legal action against him (Sisodia) for inciting fraternal bloodshed in Punjab,” SAD president wrote.State Congress chief Amarinder Singh Raja Warring took a dig at Sisodia for “revealing your intentions and exposing your designs”. “Sisodia is miserably mistaken about Punjab and Punjabis. If he believes that AAP can win by resorting to the tactics he mentioned in his speech, he is living in a fool’s paradise. You can win over Punjabis with folded hands as you did in 2022 only","Punjab BJP president Sunil Jakhar has written to the Chief Election Commissioner to file an FIR against Manish Sisodia.

‘Non-application of mind’: What Supreme Court observed while cancelling Kannada actor Darshan’s bail; pulls up Karnataka HC for giving ‘acquittal order to accused’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/non-application-of-mind-what-supreme-court-observed-while-cancelling-kannada-actor-darshans-bail-pulls-up-karnataka-hc-for-giving-acquittal-order-to-accused/articleshow/123315703.cms,"Misconduct & influence

BENGALURU: Cancelling the bail granted to Kannada actor Darshan and his six aides in the Renukaswamy murder case, the Supreme Court Thursday observed that the order of the Karnataka high court depicted ""non-application of the mind"".The apex court noted that courts are not expected to render findings on the merits of the case at the bail stage. On Dec 13, 2024, the high court single bench judge Justice S Vishwajith Shetty granted regular bail to Darshan (accused number 2), Pavithra Gowda (accused no 1) along with other accused - R Nagaraju, Anu Kumar alias Anu, Lakshman M, Jagadeesh alias Jagga and Pradoosh S Rao - on grounds of non-furnishing of a memo for reasons of arrest as per the mandate of CrPC, several inconsistencies in statements of witnesses, etc.The state govt challenged the verdict. Now, after 244 days, the Supreme Court reversed the order.During the course of hearing the appeals, the SC bench of Justices JB Paridiwala and R Mahadevan even remarked that the high court had handed out ""an acquittal order to the accused"".The bench, in the 66-page order, stated: ""In the present case, the high court failed to properly evaluate the nature of allegations, involving premeditated murder and conspiracy, attracting Section 302 of IPC read with Section 120B IPC; the chain of circumstantial evidence, including CCTV footage, call records and forensic report showing a deliberate attempt to destroy evidence (e.g.,disposal of blood-stained clothes and vehicle cleaning); and the incriminating role of A2 (Darshan), who was in constant touch with A1 (Pavithra Gowda) and other co-accused before and after the incident, and who facilitated the conspiracy and cover-up. On the other hand, it simply recorded that A2 (Darshan) had 'no direct role' and there was 'no prima facie case', without discussing or analysing the incriminating material on record. This amounts to non-application of mind and renders the order unsustainable in law.""By treating Darshan's stature as a mitigating factor, the high court committed a ""manifest perversity"" in the exercise of its discretion, thereby warranting cancellation of bail.""A2 is not a common undertrial. He enjoys celebrity status, mass following, political clout and financial muscle. His conduct inside jail - including recorded instances of VIP treatment, violations of jail rules and registered FIRs for misuse of facilities - reflects his capacity to defy the system even while in custody. If a person can subvert the prison system, the risk of interference with evidence, threatening or influencing witnesses and tampering with the course of justice is both real and imminent,"" the top court observed.Moreover, Darshan's immediate return to social events sharing the stage with prosecution witnesses, and continued influence over police witnesses, despite being on bail, establish that his liberty is a threat to the integrity of the proceedings, the court noted.""Granting leniency to such persons despite grave charges of conspiracy and murder sends the wrong message to society and undermines public confidence in the justice system. Accordingly, the accused's antecedents, influence, jail misconduct, and the seriousness of the charges against him make him unfit for bail,"" the SC stated.The apex court noted that on a cumulative analysis, it is evident that the high court suffers from serious legal infirmities. The order fails to record any special or cogent reasons for granting bail in a case involving charges under Sections 302, 120B and 34 of IPC. Instead, it reflects a mechanical exercise of discretion, marked by significant omissions of legally relevant facts.Moreover, the high court undertook an extensive examination of witness statements at the pre-trial stage, highlighting alleged contradictions and delays - issues that are inherently matters for the trial court to assess through cross-examination. The trial court alone is the appropriate forum to evaluate the credibility and reliability of witnesses, the SC observed.","Kannada actor Darshan and his six aides were granted bail in the Renukaswamy murder case.
