IPS Officer 'Suicide': Wife Seeks FIR Against Haryana DGP, Rohtak SP Over 'Harassment And Abetment'

Body taken to mortuary but autopsy put off

Pressure on Haryana governement to take action against DGP

CHANDIGARH: In the strongest commitment yet of action in the alleged suicide of senior IPS officer Y Puran Kumar, Haryana chief minister Nayab Singh Saini warned on Saturday that no one will be spared, “no matter how influential”.The CM’s statement came hours after Rohtak SP Narendra Bijarniya was removed from his post. Bijarniya has not been given any posting and will be attached to police HQ in Panchkula. Bijarniya and Haryana DGP Shatrujeet Kapur were named in Puran Kumar’s suicide note and his wife IAS officer Amneet P Kumar’s complaint to policeas the alleged “harassers” who drove him to suicide.Amneet has refused to allow an autopsy of her husband’s body until action is taken against the DGP & SP. It has been nearly five days since Puran Kumar’s suicide. On Saturday evening, while addressing the BJP state executive in Panchkula, Saini began by offering condolences to the deceased IPS officer. He expressed solidarity with the IPS officer’s family and said: “Our governement will conduct a thorough investigation into this matter.” He urged the opposition not to play politics.Chandigarh police faced backlash from the family of the IPS officer when it tried to get an autopsy done on Saturday, leading DGP Sagarpreet Hooda to say that the postmortem would not be conducted until the family agreed, reports Pawan Tiwari.Wife Amneet’s brother Amit Rattan, an AAP MLA, alleged police shifted the body without notifying the kin. The body was moved to PGI mortuary, where a team was ready for an autopsy. However, the family’s objection forced police put it on hold. DGP Hooda, IG Pushpendra Kumar & SSP Kanwardeep Kaur went to Amneet to get her nod, but she refused.Amneet P Kumar was a member of Haryana CM Nayab Singh Saini’s delegation on an official tour of Japan when her husband, Y Puran Kumar, allegedly shot himself dead.

On returning from Japan, CM Saini had called on Amneet at her Chandigarh residence.During the meeting, Amneet had handed him a two-page letter seeking justice and protection for her family and action against those named in the suicide note, especially DGP Shatrujeet Kapur and then Rohtak SP Narendra Bijarniya, for abetting her husband’s “suicide”. Two days later, on Saturday, Haryana governement removed Bijarniya and replaced him with IPS officer Surinder Singh Bhoria. This was the first action initiated by governement. Pressure is mounting on the governement to take action against Kapur as well. There is intense speculation that he may be asked to go on leave, but till Saturday evening there was no word from governement.The question in bureaucratic circles is whether governement will take action against the DGP. A section of Haryana IAS officers has also demanded Kapur’s arrest. Amneet said a “false FIR” registered in Rohtak was the “trigger point” for her husband’s “suicide”. Bijarniya was the supervising officer of the case in which head constable Sushil Kumar, PSO to Puran Kumar when he was IG Rohtak, was arrested on allegations of extortion. Police claimed Sushil had “confessed” during questioning that he had demanded money on behalf of Puran Kumar.A day after the IPS officer died, Bijarniya said, “The complainant provided audio-visual evidence which led to Sushil’s arrest. He was taken into custody for two days and confessed to demanding on behalf of Kumar. We were in the process of further investigation when we came to know about this incident (Kumar’s alleged suicide).” Kumar was shifted out as IGP (Rohtak range) on September 29. Sushil was arrested soon after. A day after the FIR was lodged, Kumar allegedly died by suicide. State chief secretary Anurag Rastogi and ACS-home Sumita Misra spent almost the entire Friday trying to pacify Amneet, but she stuck to her stand.",Haryana chief minister Nayab Singh Saini warns that no one will be spared.
