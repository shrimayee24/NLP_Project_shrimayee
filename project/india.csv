There’s no resolution on Article 370. Scaling down demands to mere statehood is a huge setback, especially after seeking votes on the promise of restoring Article 370,” PDP youth president and Pulwama MLA Waheed Parra wrote in a post on X.Baramulla MP Engineer Rashid accused Omar of playing into the hands of BJP --- a stunning reversal from the recent assembly polls when Omar had dubbed Rashid a BJP pawn who fielded candidates of his Awami Ittehad Party (AIP) to split votes. Now, Rashid alleged that NC won its 42 seats because it received “tactical” help from BJP.“NC has promised a fight against Article 370 but Omar is deviating from the main issues by focusing on statehood restoration only,” Rashid said. The MP pointed out that since PM Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah have already pledged statehood, stressing on this point while ignoring other “grave issues” tantamounts to a “betrayal” by the new CM.Rasheed claimed Omar had recently spoken about seeking restoration of special status when “BJP would not be in office at the Centre”. “I want to ask him whether Kashmiris should wait 100 years if BJP remains in power till then,” Rasheed said.People’s Conference chief and Handwara MLA Sajjad Lone argued that the resolution should have been passed in the assembly rather than the cabinet.“All across the country, to the best of my knowledge, the assembly is the proper institution for addressing major issues like that of statehood or Article 370. The will of the people of J&K is reflected in the assembly, not in the cabinet. The cabinet is a majoritarian institution. It does not reflect all shades and opinions as per the will of the people,” Lone argued. He added that revival of special status was a promise NC had made before the polls along with that of statehood.Lone questioned what he described as “secrecy” behind the way Omar’s cabinet approved the resolution and the need for it to be handed over to PM Modi.","Omar’s five-member National Conference (NC) cabinet, including deputy CM Surinder Choudhary, approved the resolution late Thursday.

BJP to contest 68 of 81 Jharkhand seats,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-to-contest-68-of-81-jharkhand-seats/articleshow/114364023.cms,"BJP cedes some J’khand seats to avoid vote-split

RANCHI: BJP announced Friday it would field candidates in 68 of Jharkhand ’s 81 assembly seats in the two-phase polls starting Nov 13, leaving the lion’s share of the rest – 10 seats – to the Sudesh Mahto-led Ajsu-P . Two seats for Bihar CM Nitish Kumar's JD(U) and one for Union minister Chirag Paswan’s LJP (Ram Vilas) rounded off NDA ’s seat-sharing math, with Jitan Manjhi’s HAM missing out.In 2019, BJP fought 79 seats and won 25. Just two out of 53 Ajsu-P candidates won.Assam CM and BJP’s Jharkhand co-incharge Himanta Biswa Sarma unveiled the list with the caveat that there could be “last-minute tweaks”, based “purely on strategy” after analysing the governing JMM-Congress combine's choice of candidates.Hours after BJP announced it would contest 68 out of 81 Jharkhand seats and leave the rest for NDA allies, JMM predicted infighting in the bloc once the constituents started announcing their candidates.JMM general secretary and spokesperson Supriyo Bhattacharya said BJP “ceded” seats in Jharkhand to its allies to keep its alliance at the Centre afloat.Sarma, who held a press conference at BJP’s state headquarters in Ranchi with Union agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, Mahto and former chief minister Babulal Marandi, said the first list of candidates would be announced along with those for Maharashtra “within the next two days”.BJP and AJSU-P intend to campaign jointly with a blend of national and regional issues, but there will be no predetermined chief ministerial candidate. “The will be contested under the stewardship of our leaders here and the karyakartas. The chief ministerial face will be decided after the election,” Sarma said.BJP chose to contest fewer seats compared to the last election, purportedly to prevent vote division. “We contested against each other five years ago, and it benefited the JMM-Congress-RJD alliance,” AJSU-P spokesperson Devsharan Bhagat said.Mahto dismissed speculation that he was disappointed at his party being allocated 10 seats. “There is no difference in opinion among us regarding seat-sharing. There has been coordination all along. We respect each other,” he said.Sarma said AJSU-P would contest the Silli, Ramgarh, Gomia, Dumri, Jugsalai (SC), Potka (ST), Icchagarh, Mandu, Pakur, Lohardaga (ST) and Manoharpur (ST) seats. JD(U) will field candidates in Jamshedpur (West) and Tamar (ST), while LJP (Ram Vilas) will contest Chatra (SC).",Assam CM and BJP’s Jharkhand co-incharge Himanta Biswa Sarma unveiled the list with the caveat that there could be ‘last-minute tweaks’ The first list of candidates would be announced along with those for Maharashtra “within the next two days”,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114364068,imgsize-1577702,width-400,resizemode-4/114364068.jpg"

The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections , which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases. The results will be declared on November 23, along with Maharashtra.In the Tribal-dominated state, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and CM Hemant's Soren Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) are in a direct fight, while the Congress party and Lalu Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) are in alliance with the JMM.The JMM-Congress-RJD alliance are also reportedly seeking to deal with Left parties, Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party and other tribal outfits that have been contesting the elections in the state as independent entities and make efforts to field candidates against the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) on all 81 seats collectively.In the last assembly polls in 2019, the JMM-Congress-RJD alliance won a comfortable majority of 47 seats in a House of 81.The BJP slipped to 25 seats from 37 it held in 2014. The poor performance was perceived to be the outcome of its decision to contest alone backfiring. The party did not foster an alliance with the Ajsu in the 2019 polls when Raghubar Das, currently the Odisha governor, was serving the state as CM.In this year's Lok Sabha polls in Jharkhand, the BJP-led NDA secured nine out of the 14 seats, with the BJP winning eight and its alliance partner, the Ajsu (All Jharkhand Students Union) Party, retaining its single seat.On the other hand, the opposition India bloc improved its tally, increasing its seat count from two in 2019 to five in the parliamentary polls.BJP and JMM have spruced up their pace of campaigning from the ground zero to social media. BJP and JMM leaders are actively rebutting and challenging each other on a range of issues, including illegal immigration, youth welfare, employment and housing.INDIA bloc parties in Jharkhand slammed the EC for holding assembly elections in the state along with that of Maharashtra but claimed that they were ready to slug it out with BJP-led NDA, which has welcomed the announcement of poll dates.JMM, Congress, and CPI (ML-L) said the announcement showed that EC was in a hurry to conduct elections though the assembly tenure was due to end in January next year.Also, both the INDIA bloc and BJP-led NDA are expected to get into huddles to discuss the modalities of seat-sharing which is going to be a challenge for both the competing teams.","The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections, which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra. Elections in Maharashtra will be held in single phase on November 20. The counting of votes will be on November 23.Maharashtra is gearing up for elections as the two major political alliances—the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) and the Mahayuti—prepare to face each other for the first time in a Vidhan Sabha election.The Maha Vikas Aghadi, comprise of the Congress, the Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray), and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) under Sharad Pawar, will go head-to-head with the Mahayuti , which includes the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Shiv Sena faction led by Eknath Shinde, and the NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar. This will be the first electoral contest between these two alliances since the splits within the Shiv Sena and NCP.The MVA is hopeful of replicating its recent Lok Sabha success, while the Mahayuti aims to retain power by leveraging its populist schemes targeted at women and youth. Both alliances have set their sights on winning the state.Narayan Rane, a former Union Minister and the victor in the Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg Lok Sabha constituency, is poised to be a key figure for the BJP in the Konkan region during the forthcoming elections. Meanwhile, two constituencies are expected to be critical battlegrounds: chief minister Eknath Shinde's Kopri-Pachpakdi seat in Thane City and Worli in Mumbai, where Aaditya Thackeray, a leader of the Shiv Sena (UBT), is seeking reelection.In the last Vidhan Sabha elections in 2019, the BJP secured 26.1% of the votes, the Congress 16.1%, the NCP 16.9%, and the Shiv Sena 16.6%. The BJP and the Shiv Sena (then united) formed the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which secured a majority. However, the coalition soon crumbled due to disagreements over government formation, plunging the state into a political crisis.After no party could establish a government, Maharashtra was placed under President's rule. Devendra Fadnavis was briefly sworn in as chief minister, with Ajit Pawar as deputy chief minister. However, both resigned just days later before a scheduled floor test.By November 28, 2019, a new coalition emerged, with the Shiv Sena (Uddhav faction), NCP (Sharad Pawar faction), and Congress forming the Maha Vikas Aghadi government, led by Uddhav Thackeray as chief minister.The state's politics took another turn in June, 2022, when Uddhav Thackeray resigned following a rebellion within the Shiv Sena, led by Eknath Shinde, who then allied with the BJP. Eknath Shinde assumed the role of chief minister, with Devendra Fadnavis returning as deputy chief minister.",The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra.

NEW DELHI: Union Minister Giriraj Singh on Friday kicked off ' Hindu Swabhiman Yatra ' from Bhagalpur district in Bihar The yatra began from Baba Budhanath temple, a shrine dedicated to Lord Shiva, where religious leaders presented him with a large ""Trishul"" (trident).The senior BJP leader shared his views with journalists before embarking on a 'Hindu Swabhiman Yatra' from Bhagalpur district in Bihar, about 150 km from his Begusarai Lok Sabha constituency.Talking to reporters before the yatra, Giriraj Singh highlighted the ""threat"" faced by Hindus , who, despite being the majority, need to be more ""organised.""""Hindus are not organised, which is why they are under threat despite being in the majority. In Bahraich, a Durga Puja procession was attacked, and a similar incident occurred in Sitamarhi, Bihar. Such incidents happen frequently, even though Hindus have never disrespected Tazia processions during Muharram. I have participated in Tazia processions myself,"" Singh said.""This yatra is not a programme organised by my party. I was born a Hindu, shall die a Hindu, and I feel it is my duty to ensure my community's safety,"" he added.He referred to attacks on Durga Puja processions in Bahraich and Sitamarhi, Bihar, as examples of the threats Hindus face despite being the majority. Singh remarked on the peaceful nature of Hindus, who do not disrespect Muharram Tazia processions, in which he has personally participated.He said his goal was to personally interact with party workers as they are closer to the ground realities and offer valuable insights.Singh also mentioned the plight of Hindus in Bangladesh and Pakistan, adding that former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru did not follow Dr. B R Ambedkar's suggestion for a complete population exchange during Partition.Singh chose Bhagalpur as the starting point due to its ""many old wounds,"" referring to past Hindu-Muslim clashes , particularly the deadly riots of 1989.While the yatra will cover several districts in the coming days, it has drawn criticism from opposition parties like the RJD BJP state unit chief Dilip Jaiswal was unaware of the yatra, emphasising the party's motto of ""sabka saath, sabka vikas."" However, BJP national spokesman Ajay Alok defended Singh's actions, stating, ""As a senior BJP leader and Union Minister, Giriraj Singh has a commitment to his faith, and he is fulfilling that.""The backdrop includes a recent incident where a 22-year-old man was shot dead, and several were injured, during communal violence in Bahraich on Sunday.","Union Minister Giriraj Singh kicked off'Hindu Swabhiman Yatra'from Bhagalpur district in Bihar.
