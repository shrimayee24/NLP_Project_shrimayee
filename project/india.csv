Gupta, who secured a decisive victory in the recently concluded assembly elections from Shalimar Bagh, will take the oath of office on Thursday at Ramlila Maidan.A seasoned BJP leader, Gupta has held several key positions within the party. She previously served as the general secretary and president of the Delhi University Students' Union (DUSU) and is a member of the party’s national executive. Her political journey includes two successful terms as a councillor, representing Uttari Pitampura in 2007 and North Pitampura in 2012.Gupta’s rise to the chief ministerial post follows her triumph over AAP's Bandana Kumari by a margin of 29,595 votes.The BJP announced its chief ministerial candidate at the last moment as part of its political strategy. Several names were in contention for the post, including Parvesh Verma, Vijender Gupta, Harish Khurana and Shikha Roy. There was also speculation about nominating MPs such as Manoj Tiwari and Bansuri Swaraj for the position.Preparations are in full swing as the BJP returns to power in Delhi after a 27-year gap, having secured victory in the February 5 assembly elections. The party ended its exile by defeating the Aam Aadmi Party , marking a significant political comeback.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah, BJP-ruled state chief ministers, NDA leaders, Union ministers, and other prominent figures are expected to attend the ceremony, according to party sources.In the results declared on February 8, the BJP secured 48 seats, significantly weakening AAP, which saw its representation drop below one-third of the total seats.

NEW DELHI: Chief minister Rekha Gupta and her ministers, sworn in on Thursday at a public function at Ramlila Maidan that was attended by PM Modi , Union ministers and many chief ministers, hit the ground running. Soon after a visit to the secretariat, the cabinet were on the Yamuna banks before convening for a meeting in the evening.The portfolios were announced at night. Among the key departments, Gupta will handle finance and revenue; Parvesh Verma PWD and water; Ashish Sood home, power, urban development and education; Manjinder Singh Sirsa industries and environment; Kapil Mishra law and justice; Dr Pankaj Kumar Singh health and transport; and Ravinder Indraj Singh social welfare.Vijender Gupta is likely to be the new Speaker.A hoarding of the CM and PM, positioned on opposite sides, served as the backdrop of the stage with 'Viksit Dilli Ka Shapath Samaroh' inscribed in the centre as lieutenant governor V K Saxena administered the oath to Gupta and her council of six ministers. She took the oath amid chants of ""Jai Shri Ram"" from a large crowd of party supporters.Sood incorporated his parents' names in the oath while Sirsa, a former Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) member, delivered his oath in Punjabi. The audience enthusiastically applauded Kapil Mishra, a Brahmin from Poorvanchal, when he took the oath.The cabinet composition reflects a careful balance of regional and caste representation, including Pankaj Singh, who is a Thakur from Poorvanchal, Indraj, who is a representative of the Scheduled Castes, and the chief minister, who is a Bania.Gupta, Sood, Singh and Indraj are first-time MLAs.The choice of venue was politically significant as it had witnessed the Jan Lokpal protests by anti-corruption activist Anna Hazare which eventually gave birth to AAP. This was the place where Arvind Kejriwal and his cabinet had been sworn in on Feb 14, 2015. Kejriwal had promised to rid the city of corruption and warned his party against ""ahankar"" (arrogance).Gupta, who became the fourth woman — and ninth overall — CM of the capital, offered prayers at Marghat Wale Hanuman Temple at Kashmere Gate before reaching the venue. She was followed in the swearing-in ceremony by New Delhi MLA Parvesh Verma who too drew enthusiastic cheers from the audience with some shouting, “Parvesh ji ko Jai Shri Ram”. Newly-elected MLAs Ashish Sood (Janakpuri), Dr Pankaj Singh (Vikaspuri), Manjinder Singh Sirsa (Rajouri Garden), Ravinder Indraj (Bawana) and Kapil Mishra (Karwal Nagar) followed.People had started gathering at the venue since early morning with many showing their support for Prime Minister Modi by wearing his masks and holding up his cutouts. Many were waving the Tricolour and party flags. A band performed patriotic and devotional melodies like ""Ram Aayenge to angna sajaenge"" and ""Aai watan"".Union home minister Amit Shah was among the first senior leaders to reach the venue, followed by BJP national president JP Nadda and Rajasthan chief minister Bhajan Lal Sharma. The loudest cheers were, of course, for Modi when he entered the stage with ministers, NDA leaders and others on the stage standing up to greet him. The PM and CM exchanged greetings with Gupta wearing a broad smile. Several women who have worked with Gupta in the party’s women’s wing had turned up in large groups to show their support to the chief minister.The event was also attended by defence minister Rajnath Singh, Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan and Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. The stage was a showcase of NDA unity with Bihar deputy CM Vijay Kumar Sinha, Rajasthan deputy CM Prem Chand Bairwa, Goa CM Pramod Sawant, Andhra Pradesh CM Chandrababu Naidu, Haryana CM Naib Singh Saini and Madhya Pradesh CM Mohan Lal Yadav also present on the stage.Spiritual leaders were also put centre stage at the event that concluded with the national anthem.Rajya Sabha MP from the Aam Aadmi Party, Swati Maliwal, whose relationship with the party turned bitter in recent times, and Congress’s Delhi president Devender Yadav were the only representatives of the Opposition.Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Modi conveyed his best wishes to Rekha Gupta on X. “Congratulations to Smt Rekha Gupta ji on taking oath as Delhi’s chief minister. She rose from the grassroots, being active in campus politics, state organisation, municipal administration, and now MLA as well as chief minister. I am confident she will work for Delhi’s development with full vigour. My best wishes to her for a fruitful tenure.”",Chief minister Rekha Gupta and her ministers were sworn in on Thursday at a public function at Ramlila Maidan.

Why it's good to be a first-time MLA in BJP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-its-good-to-be-a-first-time-mla-in-bjp/articleshow/118419086.cms,"From left - Gujarat CM Bhupendra Patel, Delhi CM Rakhi Gupta and Rajasthan CM Bhajan Lal Sharma

NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), on several occasions, has given reasons to believe that it is good to be a first-time MLA in assembly elections. Picking dark horses over front runners has been a consistent strategy by the BJP's top brass while choosing chief ministerial face in states the party has won, particularly after 2014.The BJP's first bet on a first-timer for the chief ministerial post was in 2014 when the party chose Manohar Lal Khattar to serve Haryana as CM.In 2014, Khattar was a first-time MLA, an unknown face in the state's politics who had surprised everyone by being handed the top post after BJP won 47 seats in the assembly election.Associated with the Rashtriya Swamsevak Sangh (RSS) for over four decades and BJP for 20 years, Khattar had worked as the organising secretary of BJP in Haryana and established his reputation as a key strategist for the party in the state.Khattar had worked closely with the PM when the latter was BJP in charge of Haryana in 1996. When Modi was contesting from Varanasi in the 2014 general elections, Khattar was in charge of 50 wards in the constituency.His ability to align and consolidate the non-Jat voters in favour of the BJP endeared him to the party even as the Jat community, which dominated the Haryana politics for a long period, strongly resented the BJP for reasons such as farming issues and Jat quota agitation.Another such surprise move by the party came in 2024 when it picked Bhajan Lal Sharma the chief minister of Rajasthan.Bhajan Lal Sharma, a general secretary in the BJP's state unit and a first-time MLA from Jaipur's Sanganer constituency, kept a low profile in the party before his sudden rise to the top post.Interestingly, when a group photo was taken at the BJP office ahead of the legislature party meeting, the photo showed Bhajan Lal Sharma in the very last row. However, during the Rajasthan legislature party meet Bhajan Lal was announced as the leader.Considered a hardcore RSS man, Sharma was actively involved in the agitation for the Ram temple in Ayodhya at the site where the Babri mosque stood. In 1992, he spent time in jail for this. That was around the beginning of his political career. Over the past 30 years, Sharma had held various posts in the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) and in the party organisation.The list of first-timers becoming CM only got longer on Wednesday when the BJP's top leadership backed Rekha Gupta for the Delhi CM post over Parvesh Verma who defeated Ex-Delhi CM Kejriwal in assembly elections.Rekha Gupta rose through the ranks of the RSS-affiliated outfit Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad. She has held key positions in government and the party.Gupta's political journey began in DUSU, in which she served as secretary in 1995-96, before winning the president's post in 1996-97 as an ABVP candidate. Her trajectory mirrors BJP's strategy of grooming leaders from grassroots movements.In a political purge that was seen as BJP's most audacious experiment, the party in 2021 replaced all 22 ministers from the erstwhile Vijay Rupani cabinet. The tsunami of transformation capped a frenetic six days for the state, starting with Rupani’s sudden resignation as CM. More surprising was the elevation of first-time MLA Bhupendra Patel to the chief ministership.Unanimously elected as the BJP legislature party leader, Bhupendra Patel made his way up in the state politics from the municipality level. His name was floated by outgoing CM Vijay Rupani himself.Fondly called 'Dada' by many, Patel (59) had contested his maiden assembly election from Ghatlodia constituency in Ahmedabad in 2017 and won it by a margin of over 1.17 lakh votes, which was a record during that election.BJP's move to pick CM face is not restricted to only MLAs, the party gave top post responsibility to Yogi Adityanath, who was MP from Gorakhpur, to serve as Uttar Pradesh CM in 2017.When it comes to selecting chief ministers, the BJP's script has been the same - state after state. Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Odisha, Gujarat, Haryana - all these BJP-ruled states have chief ministers who were relatively unknown figures in the party till they were picked to lead the state.The heavyweights and the frontrunners in these states lost the race to the top post. This also helps the BJP in delivering the message that a grassroots leader with an apolitical backdrop can reach the helm of electoral politics.",Picking dark horses over front runners has been a consistent strategy by the BJP's top brass. The BJP's first bet on a first-timer for the chief ministerial post was in 2014 when the party chose Manohar Lal Khattar to serve Haryana as CM. Another such surprise move by the party came in 2024 when it picked Bhajan Lal Sharma the chief minister of Rajasthan.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118422608,imgsize-1577912,width-400,resizemode-4/118422608.jpg"

The court also directed Mhada and the Nashik deputy collector (urban land ceiling) to take measures to cancel allotment of the flats after the appeals period was over.On a plea moved later, the court granted bail to the NCP functionary and his brother to enable them to appeal against their conviction before a sessions court in Nashik. Under the Representation of the People Act, a legislator attracts disqualification if convicted for two years or more, unless the conviction is stayed.Kokate is the second minister of Ajit Pawar's NCP to face the heat after Dhananjay Munde, who is under attack in the murder case of Massajog sarpanch in Beed district.Kokate, who was in court, later told reporters, ""It's a 30-year-old politically motivated case. Then MLA and former minister Tukaram Dighole raised the matter, and a police complaint was registered against me by a govt official. I haven't yet read the judgment but we will certainly file an appeal.""The court said, ""The accused no.1 at the time of the alleged incident was having post in a political party... also, he is an advocate and now he is a minister in agriculture department... therefore such approach of accused no.1 for getting the flats at a low rate by concealing information regarding his income is highly dreadful (sic).""","Manikrao Kokate and his brother, Vijay, were convicted and sentenced to two years' rigorous imprisonment for securing a flat each in 1995.
