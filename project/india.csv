HC rules out giving more time to vacate Signature View apts

New Delhi: Supreme Court Tuesday ask ed ED whether its probe into the money laundering aspect of alleged massive corruption in liquor sale by Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation (Tasmac) amounted to interference in the state’s affairs and federal structure of governance, leading the agency to assert that under the anti-money laundering law it is obligated to investigate cases anywhere once an FIR is registered.“What happens to the federal structure? Law & order are a state subject. Would ED investigations into FIRs lodged by state police not amount to encroaching upon police probe? Can ED go and investigate any crime relating to corruption in any state for inquiring into the money laundering aspect,” asked a bench of CJI B R Gavai & Justice K Vinod Chandran.New Delhi: A last-ditch effort by a few residents of Signature View Apartments to extend the timeline to vacate the towers failed before Delhi High Court on Tuesday as it said, “We will not put our seal at your risk.”A bench of Chief Justice DK Upadhyaya and Justice Tushar Rao Gedella pointed out that even the Supreme Court had highlighted that the buildings were in a dilapidated state. “In view of the order of the Supreme Court dated Oct 10, we are not inclined to grant any time extension,” the bench observed, dismissing the fresh plea filed by nine residents who had invoked the “mercy” jurisdiction of the court to seek a grace period.“If we extend time for you, we have to extend for all. This is a well-reasoned order; you challenged it, nothing was done. You are, in fact, under contempt. We will not put our seal at your risk; what if something happens to you tomorrow?” the bench orally observed. However, it suggested that the petitioners, several of them advocates, approach senior advocate Sanjay Jain, representing Delhi Development Authority, and left it to the agency’s discretion.Jain maintained that there was no sc ope for relief since SC itself had made observations. “The apex court said how can we take any responsibility on us if an untoward incident happens. No one can take any risk, given the fact the buildings are dilapidated,” he submitted.The high court, however, reminded Jain that the residents were “in this state” because of his client. “Let’s not forget that. People buy these flats with their hard-earned money and what do they end up with? The same issue is with other agencies, such as NBCC, pending before us,” it pointed out. In March, DDA issued a tender to demolish and reconstruct Signature View Apartments after Delhi High Court first cleared its proposal. Last week, the Supreme Court refused to entertain a plea challenging HC’s order that there would be no stay on demolition.",HC rules out giving more time to vacate Signature View apts.

Bihar elections 2025: How BJP is balancing anti-incumbency with caste outreach in its first candidate list,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-elections-2025-how-bjp-is-balancing-anti-incumbency-with-caste-outreach-in-its-first-candidate-list/articleshow/124556654.cms,"BJP fields Samrat Choudhary, Vijay Sinha in first list for Bihar polls

How BJP chose candidates

NEW DELHI: The anti-incumbency wave against several sitting MLAs seems to have played a major role as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) shortlisted 71 candidates out of its 101 allotted seats for the upcoming Bihar elections.In Patna alone, the BJP replaced three out of six sitting MLAs and gave a chance to fresh faces. The list came as a surprise to many, as some veterans were missing while several unexpected names appeared.For instance, former cabinet minister and Bihar assembly speaker Nand Kishore Yadav’s name was missing from the Patna Sahib seat. Similarly, many-time MLA Arun Kumar Sinha was dropped from the Kumhrar seat in Patna.""I stand with the decision of the Bharatiya Janata Party. The party has given me a lot, and I have no complaints. I welcome and congratulate the new generation. The people of the Patna Sahib Assembly constituency have elected me seven times in a row. I will never forget the affection and love they have shown me as a BJP candidate. My heartfelt gratitude to everyone,"" Nand Kishore Yadav said after the BJP released its list.Additionally, former Union minister Ram Kripal Yadav, who lost to RJD’s Misa Bharti from the Patliputra constituency in last year’s Lok Sabha elections, has been fielded from Danapur.However, of the 71, a majority, around 50 names, are repeat candidates who contested in the 2020 elections, including Awadhesh Singh from Hajipur, Sanjay Saraogi from Darbhanga), Rana Randhir Singh from Madhuban, and Pawan Jaiswal from Dhaka.The list of candidates also includes nine women, including shooter Shreyasi Singh, who made her debut from Jamui five years ago.In its first list, the BJP seems to strike a balance between social justice and political strategy. The list includes 20 candidates from Other Backward Classes (OBCs) - four Yadavs, eight Vaishyas, one Dangi, four Kushwahas, and three Kurmis.Additionally, 11 candidates from Extremely Backward Classes (EBCs) and six from Scheduled Caste (SC)-reserved seats are also fielded in the first phase of the elections.A fair representation has also been given to upper-caste groups, with candidates from Bhumihar, Brahmin, Rajput, and Kayastha backgrounds. Among the upper castes, 15 Rajputs, 11 Bhumihars, seven Brahmins and one Kayastha have been included in the first list.Fresh candidates have been fielded in Purnea, Kishanganj, Rajnagar (SC), and Narpatganj, reflecting a mix of youth representation and caste-balance considerations.Meanwhile, prominent names in the list include deputy chief ministers Vijay Kumar Sinha (Lakhisarai) and Samrat Choudhary (Tarapur), along with Mangal Pandey (Siwan), Tarkishore Prasad (Katihar), Prem Kumar (Gaya Town), and Shreyasi Singh (Jamui).The Election Commission has announced the schedule for the Bihar assembly elections. The 243 assembly seats will go to the polls in two phases - on November 6 and November 11 - with counting scheduled for November 14.The total number of electors in the final list stands at 7.42 crore, compared to 7.89 crore as of June 24 this year. An Election Commission press release stated that 65 lakh voters were removed from the draft list, bringing the total number of electors in the August 1, 2025 draft to 7.24 crore.In the 2020 assembly election, the BJP contested 110 seats and won 74, securing 19.8% of the vote share. The Janata Dal (United) contested 115 seats and won 43, with 15.7% of the vote share. The Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) contested seven seats, winning four, and achieved 0.9% of the vote share.","BJP shortlisted 71 candidates out of 101 allotted seats for Bihar elections.

NEW DELHI: Jan Suraaj on Tuesday nominated Chanchal Singh as its candidate from Raghopur for the upcoming Bihar assembly elections, reported ANI.The announcement comes amid speculation that jan suraaj chief Prashant Kishor himself might contest from the RJD stronghold. Raghopur has long been associated with the Yadav family - represented over the years by Lalu Prasad Yadav, Rabri Devi, and currently Tejashwi Yadav , who won the seat in both 2015 and 2020.Kishor, addressing reporters recently, had taken a sharp swipe at the RJD leader, saying, “If I contest from Raghopur, Tejashwi Yadav will face the same situation Rahul Gandhi faced in Amethi.” He further predicted Tejashwi’s defeat, drawing a parallel with Rahul Gandhi’s 2019 Lok Sabha loss to Smriti Irani.Referring to the political legacy in Raghopur, Kishor said, “Tejashwi Yadav, who was voted by the people of Raghopur - they made his parents the CM, and him the deputy CM. Now, the people there are in trouble, but Tejashwi doesn't care about it. He must be scared because of this.”His remarks came amid reports that Tejashwi may consider contesting from two constituencies in the upcoming polls.Raghopur is expected to be a key battleground in the elections, with Jan Suraaj looking to mount a serious challenge to the RJD in one of its core constituencies.On Monday, the jan suraaj party released its second list of candidates for 65 assembly seats.","Jan Suraaj has nominated Chanchal Singh as its candidate from Raghopur.
