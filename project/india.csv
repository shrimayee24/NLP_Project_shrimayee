CVC probing ex-CM house 'irregularities',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cvc-probing-ex-cm-house-irregularities/articleshow/123987767.cms,"Speaker's complaints on ex-CM's residence allege many violations

NEW DELHI: The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) has formally taken up the probe into alleged irregularities in the construction of former Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal's official residence on Flag Staff Road, a senior Delhi govt official.Two complaints lodged in 2024 by then leader of opposition in assembly and current speaker Vijender Gupta have been taken up by CVC after the chief vigilance officer of Central Public Works Department submitted his report. ""The apex anti-corruption body will ascertain accountability and determine future course of action,"" the official said. AAP did not comment on the matter.Gupta had allged irregularities in the construction and renovation of the CM's official residence at 6 Flag Staff Road, Civil Lines. The complaints were formally registered by CVC after the CPWD vigilance probe.The first complaint, filed in Oct, alleged illegal construction and regulatory violations in the house. Gupta alleged that there was unauthorised demolition of eight Type-V govt flats at Rajpur Road, and two govt bungalows (8A and 8B, Flag Staff Road) were amalgamated into the residence, creating a complex of nearly 8 acres without the mandatory statutory approvals.He also alleged that tenders were floated under the description of ""additions and alterations"", whereas, in reality, an entirely new structure was constructed in violation of building norms. He further alleged environmental breaches, stating that several trees were felled without the requisite clearance.The second complaint, filed in the same month, alleged misuse of public funds in renovation of the residence, claiming that crores of rupees were spent.During the Delhi assembly elections in Feb, BJP had targeted AAP on the issue, calling the renovated bungalow, ""Sheesh Mahal"". The party alleged that lavish modifications and refurbishment of the house, where Kejriwal stayed during most of his tenure as CM, showed AAP had abandoned its principles of ""representing the common man and austerity"".In 2022, the vigilance department initiated an inquiry, on LG V K Saxena's direction, into alleged irregularities and cost escalation in the renovation.AAP, in its defence, had earlier said the house was in very bad condition and needed urgent repairs; otherwise, there could have been accidents. It dismissed BJP's allegations and said whatever expenses were incurred were for the CM's house, which anyone, even after Kejriwal, would have used.","Two complaints lodged in 2024 by then leader of opposition in assembly and current speaker Vijender Gupta have been taken up by CVC.

"BJP neta's son fakes 'death' to dodge Rs 1.4 crore loan, held",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-netas-son-fakes-death-to-dodge-rs-1-4-crore-loan-held/articleshow/123986018.cms,"Vishal Soni fabricated his own death.

Neta's son also tried to stage kidnapping

BHOPAL: What began as a frantic river rescue in MP's Rajgarh district a fortnight ago, has unraveled into an elaborate fraud - Vishal Soni, son of Rajgarh BJP leader Mahesh Soni, fabricated his own death to evade Rs 1.40 crore in loans, sending police, administration, and SDERF teams on a 10-day, 20-km search of the Kalisindh River, even as he remained hidden in Maharashtra.The drama began unfolding on Sept 5, when police received information about a car sinking in the Kalisindh river. Divers retrieved the vehicle, only to find it empty. The car was identified as belonging to Vishal Soni, prompting a large-scale rescue mission. Following allegations of negligence by Vishal's father, three separate teams scoured the river for nearly two weeks, covering a 20-km stretch.When no sign of Vishal emerged after eight days, suspicions deepened. Station house officer Akanksha Hada obtained Vishal's mobile call detail records, which revealed his location in Maharashtra.Acting swiftly, MP police - assisted by their counterparts in Maharashtra - apprehended Vishal in the Fardapur police station area of Sambhaji Nagar district.During interrogation, Vishal confessed to owning six trucks and two public vehicles but being overwhelmed by debts exceeding Rs 1.40 crore.""I was told that if I got a death certificate, the bank loans would be waived,"" he reportedly told police.On September 5, at 5 am, Vishal collected money from his truck driver near Gopalpura, drove to the riverbank, switched off his car's headlights, and pushed the vehicle into the river before fleeing on the driver's bike to Indore. Reading newspaper reports of his own ""death,"" he traveled to Shirdi and Shani Shingnapur.When news reached him that police had traced his location, Vishal attempted to stage a kidnapping by tearing his clothes, rolling in dust, and filing a false report at Fardapur police station.Two days prior to his arrest, police had questioned Vishal's father and brothers, who admitted suspecting he was staying with relatives. Police noted that there was no direct constitutional provision to penalise a man for faking his own death, so Vishal was handed over to his family without a formal case.","Vishal Soni fabricated his own death to evade Rs 1.40 crore in loans.

NEW DELHI: The seat-sharing negotiations for upcoming assembly elections in Bihar have become more complex as two new parties - Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and Pashupati Paras's LJP faction - joined the Mahagathbandhan alliance. The situation is getting trickier as major parties are firm on their seat demands.The 243 seats will now be divided among eight parties -- Rashtriya Janata Dal, Congress, CPI, CPM, VIP, LJP (Paras) and JMM.“Two more parties are expected to be part of the INDIA bloc soon and we all have to sacrifice our share of seats to accommodate the new partners.” State Congress president Rajesh Kumar told reporters after a discussion during a key meeting of INDIA bloc leaders at the official residence of RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav.Meanwhile, Congress insist that it cannot go below the 70 seats.VIP chief Mukesh Sahani, on the other hand, has demanded “60 seats plus the post of deputy CM” while the CPI-ML is pressing for at least 40 seats, pointing to its past performance.The RJD is also unwilling to contest on fewer than 150 seats.In 2020 assembly elections, Rashtriya Janata Dal had contested on 144 seats, of which it won 75.Congress won 19 out of 70 seats.CPI-ML contested 19 seats and won 12.CPM contested 4 seats and was successful in winning 2 seats.CPI contested on 6 seats and won 2 seats.RJD's Tejashwi Yadav has already declared himself as the CM face of the opposition INDIA bloc.Addressing the rally in Ara town, the last stopover of the 'Voter Adhikar Yatra', Tejashwi questioned the Nitish Kumar government in Bihar for ""frequently copying his ideas"" and described it as a ""copycat government"". Ridiculing the government for copying his ideas, he said that at present he was moving ahead while the govt was behind him.""Tejashwi aage-aage, Sarkar pichhe-pichhe. Original CM chahiye ki duplicate?"" (Tejashwi is moving ahead while the govt is following him from behind. Do you want a duplicate CM or the original CM?), Tejashwi asked the crowd.","Two new parties - Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and Pashupati Paras's LJP faction - joined the Mahagathbandhan alliance.
