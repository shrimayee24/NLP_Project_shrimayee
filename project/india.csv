'Didi Defeated ED, She Will Now Defeat BJP': Akhilesh Yadav After Meeting Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee

(With ANI inputs)

NEW DELHI: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi should not ""hurt"" her, saying it would make her ""dangerous,"" and alleged that Bengali-speaking people were facing harassment in states ruled by the BJP, the governing party at the Centre.""One person came and said the government supports the Bangla language, but that's not true. Even Bengali people are being hurt for speaking Bangla in other states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. If you hurt me, I will become very dangerous,"" Banerjee said, addressing PM Modi.She also claimed that the ongoing electoral roll revision in the poll-bound state is causing people to ""suffer.""""In the name of SIR (Special Intensive Revision), you (PM Modi) are making people suffer. Shame on you. Election Commission, this is not your work,"" the Trinamool Congress chief remarked.Earlier this week, Banerjee launched a sharp attack on the Election Commission of India (ECI), accusing it of ""snatching away"" people's voting rights while simultaneously celebrating National Voters' Day (January 25). In a post on X, she wrote she was ""deeply distressed"" by the ECI's conduct, alleging that the poll body is ""harassing people"" under the pretext of ""logical discrepancies"" in voter lists.""Election Commission of India is celebrating National Voters' Day today, and what a tragic farce that is! The Commission—working as His Master's Voice—is busy snatching away people's voting rights, yet they have the temerity to celebrate Voters' Day! I am deeply distressed and disturbed by their conduct today,"" Banerjee posted.She added, ""Instead of complying with the Hon'ble Supreme Court's verdict and following rules to protect the democratic voting rights of people, the ECI is finding newer pretexts in the name of logical discrepancy to harass and deny people their electoral rights.""West Bengal is expected to hold assembly elections in April and May. Banerjee, who has led the TMC government since 2011, will seek a fourth consecutive term when the state goes to the polls.","West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said Prime Minister Narendra Modi should not ""hurt"" her.

'To Remove Corrupt DMK': TTV Dhinakaran Meets Goyal As AMMK Rejoins NDA Ahead Of Tamil Nadu Polls

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Rahul Gandhi and DMK parliamentarian Kanimozhi met on Wednesday for discussions on the Tamil Nadu assembly elections but no agreement was reached on seat-sharing in the state, where the DMK is in power and the Congress is its ally.“It was a pleasant meeting, and no seat-sharing numbers were discussed, but there was an emphasis on showing respect for the Congress,” a party source said, according to PTI.The source added that during the meeting at former Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s 10, Janpath residence in Delhi, her son and Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi told Kanimozhi that the DMK should hold talks with the committee formed by Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge to resolve seat-sharing issues.Congress leaders in Tamil Nadu are reportedly seeking a ""substantial increase"" in the number of seats the party contests in the upcoming assembly elections, along with a ""proper share"" in power. However, the DMK is unwilling to offer more seats than it did in the last election.In 2021, the grand old party contested 25 of the 234 assembly constituencies and won 18.Tamil Nadu chief minister and DMK supremo MK Stalin shares good relations with the Congress leadership and, therefore, the issue is expected to be resolved soon, sources noted.Some state Congress leaders have also discussed the possibility of an alliance with actor Vijay’s newly formed Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK), though the Congress leadership is reportedly keen on contesting the elections with the DMK.The Tamil Nadu assembly elections are likely to be held in April–May.","Congress MP Rahul Gandhi and DMK parliamentarian Kanimozhi met on Wednesday for discussions on the Tamil Nadu assembly elections.
