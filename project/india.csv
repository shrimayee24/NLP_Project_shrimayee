'Vote Chori Is The Biggest Anti-National Act': Rahul Gandhi Slams BJP In Lok Sabha

Kharge says RSS ideology will destroy the country

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Sunday said his party stood with “satya” (truth) and pledged to oust the “Narendra Modi-RSS government” from power.Addressing the Congress party ’s ‘Vote Chor Gaddi Chhod’ rally at Ramlila Maidan in Delhi, the leader of opposition in the Lok Sabha launched a sharp attack on the Election Commission He named Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar and Election Commissioners Sukhbir Singh Sandhu and Vivek Joshi, alleging that they were working in favour of the Bharatiya Janata Party.“We will stand with ‘satya’ (truth) and will remove the Narendra Modi-RSS government from power. They have ‘satta’ (power), and they indulge in ‘vote chori’,” Gandhi said.He claimed that the BJP transferred Rs 10,000 during elections but alleged that the poll panel failed to take action. “In this fight between truth and untruth, the Election Commission is working with the BJP government,” Gandhi said.Gandhi further alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had brought in a new law granting immunity to the Election Commission and said it would be changed. “(Prime Minister Narendra) Modi brought a new law to give immunity to EC; we will change this law retroactively and act against election commissioners,” he said.Asserting that truth would ultimately prevail, even if it took time, Gandhi added, “We’ll work with truth and non-violence to defeat Modi and (Amit) Shah.”Alleging that the ideology of the Manusmriti, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will ""destroy the nation"", Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge on Sunday pitched that it is only the ideology of the opposition party which will ultimately save the country's Constitution from being destroyed.""Only Congress party's ideology can save the nation; ideology of (Mohan) Bhagwat, (Madhav Rao) Gowalkar Guruji, or the Manusmriti will not save the nation, but destroy it. The path the BJP, PM Modi is going, slowly and steadily, they are trying to finish the Constitution,"" Kharge said during his speech.The Congress chief praised Rahul Gandhi for working to ""save the country"" and the people's vote.""Rahul Gandhi is fighting for the country, and to strengthen that fight is the responsibility of us all, that is what I want to request you all. If you do strengthen those ideas then it is your loss, the country's loss, not his loss. If you want to save the country, if you want to save your vote, protect it, if you want to save the Constitution, then you can work for yourself. The work of bringing forward our ideology, ideas, is being done by Rahul Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi, today Priyanka is also doing,"" Kharge said.Launching a scathing attack on the party, Kharge alleged that the ideology of the 'sangh parivar' is looking to enslave people under the guise of Hinduism.""Everyone is there under the Hindu religion, but under the guise of Hinduism, they want to enslave people. If you want to be a slave, if you give up your self-respect, then you will be finished. The freedom we got (from the Britishers) was given by Congress. Did Modi give it? Modi was not even born then. Amit Shah was just a kid then. These people talk against Nehru, Gandhi, and Ambedkar,"" he said.",Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Sunday said his party stood with “satya’ (truth) and pledged to oust the “Narendra Modi-RSS government’ Gandhi also launched a sharp attack on the Election Commission. He named Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar and Election Commissioners Sukhbir Singh Sandhu and Vivek Joshi.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125960780,imgsize-13014,width-400,resizemode-4/rahul-gandhi-ram-lila-rally.jpg"

‘Didn’t Go For Son’s Operation’: Kharge Lauds Rahul Gandhi In ‘Vote Chori’ Rally, Calls BJP ‘Gaddar’

NEW DELHI: Taking his months-long campaign of ""vote chori"" to its climax, Congress's Rahul Gandhi on Sunday led a packed Ramlila Maidan rally to raise the slogan of ""vote chor, gaddi chhod"", as he claimed that the Modi-led BJP is winning elections by stealing votes but ""Narendra Modi-RSS govt"" would ultimately be evicted from power.Rahul said ""vote chori"" is principally BJP's attack on Ambedkar's Constitution that has enshrined the right to vote. He said BJP's DNA has ""vote chori"" just as truth is Congress's DNA, and accused Election Commission of working at BJP's behest.Interacting with the party workers who had poured in from across the country for the rally, Rahul said PM Narendra Modi has lost his confidence which is reflected on his face, just like Amit Shah's hands were trembling in Lok Sabha when he challenged the home minister to a debate on his press conferences about ""rigged"" elections.""You look at Modi's face carefully. Have you seen it? It is so because he knows his 'vote chori' has been caught, and the country would know their reality in the coming time,"" he said, referring to a point made by Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in her speech.Planned as a mass gathering to mark the conclusion of the party's nationwide signature campaign on ""vote chori"", the dais featured the Congress brass of Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge and Sonia Gandhi, CMs Siddaramaiah, Sukhwinder Sukhu and Revanth Reddy, CWC members Ajay Maken, KC Venugopal, Sachin Pilot, Abhishek Singhvi, Gaurav Gogoi and P Chidambaram, among others.In framing the argument made by speakers who linked ""vote chori"" to BJP's desire for victory at all costs, Rahul started his speech by referring to RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat's reported statement in Andamans that ""world recognises power, not truth"". ""Hindu religion, and ideology of world religions, says that truth is most important, but Bhagwat says truth means nothing and power is important. That is the crux of the ongoing battle in India. It is a fight between 'satya and asatya',"" he said, mentioning ""Satyam Shivam Sundaram"" and ""Satyamev Jayate"".Rahul, as also Priyanka, kept the poll panel in their crosshairs, even leading the crowd in repeating the names of CEC Gyanesh Kumar and ECs SS Sandhu and Vivek Joshi. ""Remember the names,"" they said to the crowd in their separate speeches. Rahul said Congress govt will retrospectively remove the immunity provided to the ECs by the law brought by Modi in 2023, and would act against them, repeating the chilling warning he made during the debate in LS. ""You are India's EC, not Modi's EC,"" he said.","Rahul Gandhi led a packed Ramlila Maidan rally to raise the slogan of ""vote chor, gaddi chhod"" He claimed that the Modi-led BJP is winning elections by stealing votes but ""Narendra Modi-RSS govt"" would ultimately be evicted from power.

Bihar Minister Nitin Nabin Appointed National Working President Of BJP

New Delhi: As far as dark horses go, Nitin Nabin 's elevation in the BJP organisation was as big a surprise as they come. The BJP parliamentary board on Sunday named the 45-year-old minister in the Bihar govt its working president, putting him on track to become the youngest to helm the party, though with considerable experience as a five-term MLA.His appointment is being seen as a precursor to his eventual election as the party's national president in place of JP Nadda once the polling process is unveiled. The generous praise heaped on him by its brass, led by PM Narendra Modi, made it all but certain.Nabin's rise bears an unmistakable imprint of Modi, who is known for his out-of-box approach on weighty issues of governance and politics, and Amit Shah , and marks another generational change at the apex of BJP's organisation, which underwent its first round of transformation after Modi's elevation as the party's mascot in 2013, with Shah in 2014 and Nadda in 2020 being entrusted with the organisational leadership.Modi praised him on X, saying, ""Nitin Nabin has made his distinct identity as a dedicated worker. He is a young and hardworking leader who has a considerable organisational experience. His work as an MLA and minister in Bihar has been very effective, and he has worked with complete dedication to fulfil people's aspirations. He is known for his humble nature and grassroots work.""","Bihar Minister Nitin Nabin appointed National Working President of BJP.

'We Are United...Will Go To Delhi If High Command Calls': Siddaramaiah, Shivakumar After Meeting

BENGALURU: Karnataka deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar met with over 30 Congress legislators and ministers for a dinner meeting late Thursday night in Belagavi, amid ongoing speculations about potential leadership changes in the state government.According to news agency PTI sources, dinner gathering included prominent ministers K H Muniyappa, Mankal Vaidya, Dr M C Sudhakar, and several MLAs including N A Haris, Ramesh Bandisiddegowda, H C Balakrishna, Ganesh Hukkeri, Darshan Dhruvanarayana, Ashok Kumar Rai, and K Y Nanjegowda.Expelled BJP MLAs ST Somashekhar and Shivaram Hebbar were also present.This meeting followed a separate dinner hosted by former Belagavi North MLA Feroz Sait the previous day, which was attended by Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and his close associates.While party leaders describe these as casual dinner meetings, they have attracted attention due to the ongoing power dynamics within the ruling party regarding the chief minister position.The timing of these gatherings is significant as they occurred after speculation about a possible change in chief minister when the Congress government completed its half-term on November 20, 2023.The party high command had recently instructed both Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar to meet over breakfast at each other's residences.This move was seen as an attempt to pause the leadership tussle between the two leaders.These breakfast meetings were also interpreted as a signal for Siddaramaiah's continuation as chief minister for the immediate future, particularly before the Belagavi legislature session.The recent developments follow rumors about a possible power-sharing agreement between Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar after Congress won the Assembly election in 2023."," DK Shivakumar met with over 30 Congress legislators and ministers for a dinner meeting late Thursday night in Belagavi.
