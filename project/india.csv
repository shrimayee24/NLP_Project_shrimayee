""Sharad Pawar is a large-hearted and senior leader. His comments are priceless for me,"" he added.Last week, Thackeray and Fadnavis held a meeting for over 20 minutes at the office of Legislative Council Chairman Ram Shinde.The meeting was held a day after Fadnavis said that Thackeray ""can come to the ruling side in a different way.""""At least till 2029, there is no scope for us to come there (opposition). Uddhav Ji can think about the scope of coming to this side (ruling party) and that can be thought about in a different way, but there is absolutely no scope left for us to come there (opposition),"" Fadnavis had said.The BJP and Shiv Sena enjoyed a stable alliance for over 25 years until friction emerged in 2014 over seat-sharing arrangements.Despite contesting the 2019 Maharashtra assembly elections together and securing a majority, Uddhav Thackeray broke away post-polls to form a government with the Congress and NCP under the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) banner, a move seen as betrayal by the BJP.However, in 2022, Fadnavis played a central role in engineering a dramatic political coup. With support from Eknath Shinde, who split the Shiv Sena, the MVA government collapsed, and the BJP returned to power in alliance with the Shinde-led Sena faction. Fadnavis took the deputy chief minister’s post, while Shinde assumed the chief ministership. Although the alliance secured a sweeping mandate in the 2024 elections, Shinde, who had been chief minister since the coup, appeared hesitant to relinquish the top post to Fadnavis.Moreover, speculation over a possible alliance between Uddhav Thackeray’s Shiv Sena (UBT) and Raj Thackeray’s Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) has grown since the two leaders appeared together on July 5, their first joint appearance in 20 years. The show of unity came as they celebrated the state government’s rollback of Hindi language mandates in schools.",Devendra Fadnavis thanked NCP(SP) president Sharad Pawar and Shiv Sena(UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray for praising him in the coffee table book 'Maharashtra Nayak' This comes amid a heightened political chatter of a reunion.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122840516,imgsize-886303,width-400,resizemode-4/122840516.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Parliament on Tuesday witnessed a strong opposition offensive against the special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar, with members across party lines forcing a washout of proceedings in Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha, and holding a sit-in in the Parliament complex.INDIA bloc members Rahul Gandhi, Akhilesh Yadav, Kanimozhi, TR Baalu, Misa Bharti, Manoj Jha, Kalyan Banerjee, KC Venugopal and a host of other MPs gathered at the main gate of the Parliament building, where they raised slogans against the SIR and demanded that it be scrapped.At the meeting of the INDIA bloc in the chamber of Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, the opposition decided to take up the issue in the two Houses to ensure that the urgent concern of RJD was not overshadowed by the controversy over Pahalgam terror attack and Operation Sindoor in the opening days of the Monsoon session.The issue figured prominently in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha that failed to transact any business. The opposition has listed Election Commission's electoral rolls review in poll-bound Bihar as its top priority alongside the terror attack for discussion. Congress whip Manickam Tagore said, ""In the first half, LoP (in LS) Rahul Gandhi wanted to speak but he was not allowed, just like Monday. We want a discussion on SIR which is a govt conspiracy to take away the right to vote of the poor. """,MPs across party lines forced a washout of proceedings in Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha.

SRINAGAR: As Congress launched protests in Delhi on Tuesday for restoration of J&K’s statehood, chief minister Omar Abdullah voiced displeasure at not being consulted or informed by its INDIA bloc ally.“Let them talk to us first. We only read about these things (protests) in newspapers. No one reached out to us. Even during the recent INDIA bloc meeting (July 19), there was no mention of these things. Had they informed us, we would have joined,” Omar said when asked if NC would back Congress’s agitation.Omar’s statements mirrored “quiet frustration” within the ranks of his National Conference (NC) over Congress’s “sudden interest” in the issue, with some fearing such protests could delay statehood as the Narendra Modi-led NDA govt at the Centre would not want to be seen buckling under opposition pressure.Omar pointed out that statehood restoration had been a long-standing demand of his govt and his party. “We passed a resolution for it in the very first cabinet meeting (Oct 2024) and later in the assembly. It is good that Congress is finally remembering this issue after a long time. But if they need our support, they should first talk to us,” Omar said.On July 17, Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi and Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge wrote to Prime Minister Modi demanding statehood restoration by bringing a bill in Parliament’s ongoing monsoon session.Two days later, Congress held protests in Kashmir on the issue.NC sources said they were caught off guard by Congress’s letter to the PM and the subsequent protests. “At a time when we believed the Modi govt was showing some inclination towards restoring statehood, it was prudent for Congress to wait until the end of the monsoon session,” a senior NC functionary said.By jumping the gun, Congress may have politicised a sensitive issue and, possibly, delayed the restoration, NC sources said. “Modi govt is unlikely to give any impression that it is yielding to opposition pressure, even though the restoration of J&K’s statehood is its own commitment. Congress should have taken the CM (Omar) and NC into confidence before writing to the PM or going for the protests,” the NC senior said.",Omar Abdullah voiced displeasure at not being consulted or informed by its INDIA bloc ally.

"'This is hypocrisy': Mutton Rogan Josh spices up Bihar politics on Shravan Monday; BJP, RJD trade barbs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/bihars-election-platter-turns-spicy-with-mutton-parties-in-shravan/articleshow/122843613.cms,"As the holy month of Shrawan sees Shiva devotees fasting, mutton dishes have sparked political debates in Bihar. Mutton Rogan Josh served at the state assembly stirred controversy, with Tejashwi Yadav accusing NDA leaders of hypocrisy regarding meat consumption during the sacred period.





PATNA: Holy Shrawan month is on, and temples are abuzz with Shiva devotees fasting. Vegetarianism is in vogue. But in poll-bound Bihar, guess what's stealing the spotlight? Mutton curries!Mutton Rogan Josh — that rich, aromatic Kashmiri delight made a surprise appearance in the central hall of the state assembly on Monday, the second Somwari. The occasion? First day of the monsoon session before the state goes to polls.The serving was enough to stir a political potboiler.Leader of opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav wasted no time. He accused the NDA leader of adopting a ""double standard"" over meat consumption.""BJP MLAs relished mutton on Shravan Somwari (Monday). We have no objection to anyone's food choice, but the PM should not be ‘selective' in his attacks. While he finds it pleasing that his party leaders eat mutton during Shravan, he doesn't hesitate to attack opposition leaders even though they avoid non-vegetarian foods,"" Tejashwi posted on social media.He also uploaded a video of the stall with ""Mutton Rogan Josh"" to highlight his point. The video has gone viral on social media.The BJP reacted by saying that Tejashwi, being the leader of the opposition, should focus on the election looming large rather than watching who is eating what.""Maybe the caterer also arranged for the mutton dish along with vegetarian food, but did Tejashwi only watch who ate the mutton?"" state BJP spokesperson Manoj Sharma said on Tuesday.Mocking Tejashwi, Sharma said whether the leader of opposition should scan the CCTV images to find out who consumed what or focus on Bihar's development.This isn't the first time mutton has made an entry in Shravan when majority Hindus turn vegetarian.Last week, Union minister Rajiv Ranjan alias Lalan Singh triggered a similar row when he hosted a mutton party for his supporters in Lakhisarai, which is a part of his Munger Lok Sabha constituency. In a video that went viral, Lalan is heard saying that he arranged both ""vegetarian and non-vegetarian"" foods. Tejashwi again took a dig at Singh for hosting a mutton party during Shravan.Earlier this month, Jan Suraaj founder Prashant Kishor arranged ""biryani"" for all those who came to hear his speech in Kishanganj district. TV footage released later showed people crowding the food stalls and scrambling to get the food packets. But the party claims it was ""vegetarian biryani"" and not mutton.Mutton had been the menu for controversy earlier also when RJD chief Lalu Prasad cooked a special mutton dish for Congress MP Rahul Gandhi at his daughter's residence in Delhi during Shrawan in 2023. The video of Lalu cooking mutton in a desi style and stirring in a pot went viral at that time, drawing sharp reactions from the NDA.Later, Tejashwi and his ally, Muhesh Sahani, drew bitter criticisms from the NDA leader after both were caught on camera relishing fish during a chopper ride as part of the poll campaign during the LS elections. The NDA leaders targeted the duo, describing their acts as an ""insult to sanatan"" for relishing during ""Navaratra"". Later, Tejashwi clarified that they had eaten the non-vegetarian dish before the start of Navarata.","Mutton Rogan Josh served at the state assembly stirred controversy.

PUNE: A purported aide of a senior BJP leader, Prafulla Lodha (62), who has been accused by the opposition of being involved in an alleged honey-trapping operation used to topple the MVA govt in the state, has been booked by Pune's Bavdhan police on charges of sexually assaulting a 36-year-old woman under the pretext of helping her husband secure a job and later threatening to take away her job when she refused to have sex with him.Lodha is in Mumbai police's custody in connection with similar cases registered at MIDC and Sakinaka police stations.Pimpri Chinchwad police said that the alleged sexual assault occurred on May 27 in a hotel room in Pune. ""The woman approached us with her complaint on July 17 and we immediately registered a case. We are in the process of securing Lodha's custody from our Mumbai counterparts,"" said senior inspector Anil Vibhute of Bavdhan police.Police have invoked sections 64 (1) (rape) and 351 (2) (criminal intimidation) of Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita in the case.The survivor is the sole breadwinner of her family and the accused threatened to take away her job using his influence. Vibhute said the woman was scared after the accused threatened her. The officer said she reached the police station more than a month after the incident, when she gained the courage to lodge a complaint.Sakinaka police had booked Lodha, from Jalgaon district, earlier this month for allegedly sexually assaulting a 16-year-old girl and her friend, also under the pretext of getting them jobs. He was also accused of holding them captive and torturing them at his house in Chakala. In another case registered against him at the MIDC police station in the same month, he allegedly raped a woman in Andheri using the same ruse. He was arrested by Mumbai police from Chakala on July 5.On Monday, Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut had alleged that Lodha had played a key role in an alleged honeytrap operation involving several MPs and MLAs of the state. Raut had said they were blackmailed using compromising videos and these were also used to topple the MVA govt. Last week, Congress leaders had claimed that 72 politicians, bureaucrats and former officials had allegedly fallen prey to the honeytrap in the state.
