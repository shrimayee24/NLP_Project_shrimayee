'Gaping holes': SC frees death row convict in Mumbai rape-murder,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gaping-holes-sc-frees-death-row-convict-in-mumbai-rape-murder/articleshow/117664389.cms,"NEW DELHI: In the Jan 2014 Mumbai rape-murder of an IT professional that created as much sensation as the 2012 Nirbhaya case , Supreme Court Tuesday acquitted Chandrabhan Sudam Sanap by setting aside concurrent decisions of a trial court and Bombay HC that had convicted him and awarded death penalty. ""He shall be set at liberty forthwith, if not required in any other case,"" SC said.Authoring the 113-page judgment that results in a heinous crime going unpunished, Justice KV Viswanathan, part of a bench comprising Justices B R Gavai and Prashant K Mishra, said, ""Prosecution has not established its case beyond reasonable doubt. Hence, we are constrained to come to the sole irresistible conclusion that the appellant is not guilty of the offences for which he has been charged.""The 23-year-old woman, referred to as 'EA' in the SC judgment, was working in Mumbai and staying at the YWCA Hostel for women in Andheri. She had visited her parents in Machilipatnam in Andhra Pradesh in Dec and was seen off at the Vijayawada railway station by her father on Jan 4, 2014.As she could not be contacted over phone subsequently, the father lodged a missing person complaint and went to Mumbai in search of his daughter. EA's body, half-burnt and decomposed, was discovered on Jan 16, 2014, in some bushes near the Eastern Express Highway.SC analysed and re-appreciated the entire evidence produced by police before the trial court and said, ""We allow the appeal (of Sanap) and set aside the judgment of the HC and acquit the appellant with regard to the offences for which he was charged in this case.""Doubting the veracity of Sanap's purported extra-judicial confession about committing the crime after picking the woman from the railway station in Mumbai on the promise to drop her to Andheri, the apex court bench said, ""There is no corroboration in material particulars and hence we are inclined to reject the extra-judicial confession.""The SC discarded the evidence linking the bike allegedly used in the commission of the crime to the accused. The court also discarded the evidence emerging from the test identification parade during which the accused was identified by witnesses on the ground that the photo of the accused was splashed all over the media by the time the TIP took place.The court also discarded the alleged recovery of the deceased woman's suitcase from the accused's sister and said, ""Merely based on the recovery, no conviction for the offence charged could be sustained against the appellant in this case. As to why the college identity card of the deceased EA would be preserved by the accused and kept in custody of the sister nearly two months after the incident is something we find very intriguing.""The SC added, ""All these facts cumulatively constrain us to conclude that there are gaping holes in the prosecution story leading to the irresistible conclusion that there is something more than what meets the eye in this case. While the adage - witness may lie but not the circumstances - may be correct, however, the circumstances adduced, as held by this court, should be fully established. ""There is a legal distinction between 'may be proved' and 'must be or should be proved' as held by this court. The circumstances relied upon when stitched together do not lead to the sole hypothesis of the guilt of the accused and we do not find that the chain is so complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused.""","The 23-year-old woman, referred to as 'EA' in the SC judgment, was working in Mumbai and staying at the YWCA Hostel for women in Andheri. She had visited her parents in Machilipatnam in Andhra Pradesh in Dec and was seen off by her father on Jan 4, 2014.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117664451,imgsize-48978,width-400,resizemode-4/117664451.jpg"

"Give proof of Yamuna ‘poisoning’, EC directs Arvind Kejriwal as it cites BNS provisions",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/give-proof-of-yamuna-poisoning-ec-directs-arvind-kejriwal-as-it-cites-bns-provisions/articleshow/117663020.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission on Tuesday issued a notice to former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal seeking facts and evidence to substantiate his allegation that Haryana had poisoned Yamuna waters released to Delhi, which he claimed could have caused “genocide” had the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) engineers not stopped the waters at Delhi border.Importantly, the poll panel reminded him of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) provisions against statements that cause enmity between groups, are prejudicial to national integration and create public mischief, all of which attract a maximum jail term of three years.This could mean that EC, in the event of lack of sufficient evidence backing Kejriwal’s allegations, may consider ordering a criminal case/FIR to be registered against him, invoking the aforesaid provisions of BNS as well as Section 123(4) of the Representation of the People Act (false statement being a corrupt practice). This would be in addition to likely action for violation of the model code of conduct.Stating that the allegations of an elected govt poisoning the Yamuna waters with an intention to kill the residents of Delhi and equating this with nuclear or biological war, coming from a leader of Kejriwal’s stature, are “extremely serious in nature and unprecedented”, the Election Commission asked the AAP national convener to reply to its notice by 8 pm on Wednesday, citing the “factual foundation” of his allegations, “especially when the veracity...is contested”. The notice cites the clarification of Delhi Jal Board, posted on X on Monday, denying Kejriwal’s poisoning claims as “false, misleading and factually incorrect”.“Being a very senior leader with vast administrative experience, you must definite have the evidence to substantiate such serious allegations....It is presumed that the Govt of NCT of Delhi must have officially taken up such a serious and grave issue of public health with the state govt of Haryana,” EC stated in its notice that followed separate complaints by the BJP and Congress.Stating that Kerjiwal’s allegations, if true, run the risk of “creating enmity between the regional groups, residents of neighbouring states, and threat of law and order situation due to actual or perceived shortage of non-availability of water during this time of the year”, EC drew his attention to BNS provisions including Section 196 (statements that promote enmity between groups), Section 197 (imputations prejudicial to national integration) and Section 353 (public mischief), all of which carry a maximum three-year jail term, fine or both.The EC also cited Section 123 (4) of the R P Act as well as model code provisions that restrain candidates and parties from activities that create hatred and tension between groups, as also from criticism of other parties based on unverified allegations or distortion.As regards the other complaint received from chief ministers of Delhi and Punjab about sharp increase in ammonia levels in Yamuna waters released by Haryana, which the former claimed had made it untreatable, leading to a water shortage and public health crisis, EC said it had already called for a report from Haryana govt and was dealing with the complaint separately after considering the inputs from Haryana govt.","The Election Commission has issued a notice to former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.
