KOLKATA: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP-led Centre over comments made at his Alipurduar rally, accusing them of ""going silent in front of America"", selling ""sindoor everywhere"", and using Operation Sindoor for ""political traction"".She also targeted junior Union minister Sukanta Majumdar's ""Operation Bengal after Operation Sindoor"" statement in Modi's presence. ""This implies equating Bengal with terrorism,"" she said, challenging Modi to ""hold elections tomorrow if you have the courage"".Banerjee accused BJP of politicising women's safety, saying: ""Why have terrorists responsible for wiping sindoor not been arrested yet? ... he is selling sindoor everywhere, even in poll campaigns.""Responding to Modi's ""cruelty"" remark, Banerjee accused BJP of being ""the mastermind behind riots"". She referred to Madhya Pradesh's Vyapam scam to return the PM's teacher recruitment fire: ""What happened in Vyapam? How many people died?

Unnatural sex against wife's will is cruelty: MP HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/unnatural-sex-against-wifes-will-is-cruelty-mp-hc/articleshow/121500149.cms,"Representative image

BHOPAL/JABALPUR: Madhya Pradesh high court (HC) held that forcing unnatural sex on one's wife, coupled with physical assault and cruelty, constitutes an offence under IPC section 498A, and upheld an FIR registered by a woman against her husband. The court, however, said the husband cannot be prosecuted under IPC sections 377 or 376 as 'marital rape' is not an offence under the law.Police had registered a case against the accused under IPC sections 377, 323 and 498A which he challenged in HC, contending that unnatural sex with wife is not recognised as an offence in Indian law. Also, 498A is not applicable as no dowry harassment has been alleged in the FIR, he argued.Justice G S Ahluwalia of Gwalior bench, in his order, said, ""Committing unnatural sex with a wife against her wishes and on her resistance, assaulting and treating her with physical cruelty will certainly fall within the definition of cruelty. It is not out of place to mention here that demand of dowry is not sine qua non for cruelty.""The order said, ""From a plain reading of IPC section 498A, it is clear that any wilful conduct which is of such nature as is likely to drive the woman to commit suicide or cause grave injury or danger to life, limb, or health, whether mental or physical, to the woman, would amount to cruelty.""It is clear that unnatural sex with wife would not be an offence under section 376 or 377 of IPC, HC said, and quashed this charge in the FIR.""However, since there are specific allegations that whenever the wife resisted the unnatural conduct of petitioner, she was assaulted and treated with physical cruelty, this court is of the opinion that offence under section 498A IPC is made out. Accordingly, this application is partially allowed. Offence under section 377 is hereby quashed. However, FIR in relation to offence under Section 498A and 323 stands,"" the court said.","Madhya Pradesh high court upholds an FIR registered by a woman against her husband. The court, however, said the husband cannot be prosecuted under IPC sections 377 or 376 as'marital rape' is not an offence under the law. Police had registered a case against the accused under Ipc sections 377, 323 and 498A.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121500307,imgsize-1154230,width-400,resizemode-4/121500307.jpg"

""They were detained for two days before being falsely shown as arrested with opium under NDPS Act. All five were sent to jail and remained in custody for a month,"" their advocate said.Their advocate Mohammad Tasleem Gazi said, ""We filed an application under BNSS section 175 in the court of CJM Budaun Mohd Tauseef Raza.

But the general diary mentioned July 30 as the arrest date, and the FIR was registered on July 31 under NDPS sections. The cops confined my clients illegally in the thana."" The CJM also directed a probe.In a similar incident in Agra, a local court in June 2023 acquitted Ankit Gupta, a 37-year-old salesman who had been falsely accused of possessing 74.9 kg of marijuana.
