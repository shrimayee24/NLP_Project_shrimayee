NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) National Convenor Arvind Kejriwal wrote a letter on Wednesday to Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat, raising questions about the Bharatiya Janata Party 's (BJP) actions. Kejriwal sought clarification on whether the RSS supports certain practices by the BJP.In his letter, Kejriwal asked, ""Whatever wrong BJP has done in the past, does RSS support it? BJP leaders are openly distributing money. Does RSS support buying votes? Dalit and Purvanchali votes are being cut on a large scale. Does RSS think this is right for democracy? Does RSS not think that BJP is weakening democracy?""Kejriwal also raised concerns about alleged voter list manipulation by BJP leaders. Dalit and Purvanchali votes (from the voter list) are being cut on a large scale. Does RSS think this is good for democracy? Doesn't RSS feel that the BJP is weakening democracy?""Earlier on Monday, AAP spokesperson Priyanka Kakkar accused BJP leader Vishal Bharadwaj of filing applications to delete voters’ names in the Shadara constituency, particularly targeting Purvanchali voters. Kakkar said, “When we raised our voices against it, then he stopped it.”She also claimed that BJP leader Parvesh Sharma distributed money for votes in the New Delhi constituency and submitted conflicting applications to the Election Commission (EC) for voter additions and deletions. “A BJP leader put an application in ECI for deletion of voters' names. There was another application to add names of voters. BJP is rattled,” Kakkar said.On Sunday, Kejriwal had alleged that BJP is “manipulating voters' lists.” However, the Chief Electoral Officer of Delhi clarified that all objections and claims regarding the draft electoral roll had been resolved by December 24, and the final roll would be published on January 6, 2025.The allegations come as AAP and BJP prepare for the 2025 Delhi Assembly elections, with both parties accusing each other of voter-related irregularities.",Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) National Convenor Arvind Kejriwal wrote a letter on Wednesday to Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat.

NEW DELHI: The Congress party on Monday issued clarification on BJP's allegations that the top party leaders did not accompany the family for immersion of the ashes of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.""Senior Congress leaders did not accompany the family to gather and immerse the ashes of Manmohan Singh ji out of our deference to the privacy of the family,"" AICC's media and publicity chairperson Pawan Khera said in a statement released on Monday.The statement further read, ""After the cremation of our beloved departed leader, Sonia Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra met the family at their residence.""""After discussing with them, it was felt that since the family did not get any privacy at the time of the cremation and some extended family members could not reach the pyre site, it would be appropriate to give them some privacy for the Phool Chunana and the immersion of the ashes which is an emotionally painful and difficult ceremony for close family members,"" the statement added.The ashes of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh were immersed in the Yamuna River near the Majnu ka Tila Gurdwara on Sunday by his family members, following Sikh rituals.Singh’s ashes were collected from the Nigambodh Ghat on Sunday morning and taken to the 'Asth Ghat' on the Yamuna River bank near the gurdwara for immersion.His wife, Gursharan Kaur, and their three daughters—Upinder Singh, Daman Singh, and Amrit Singh—were present at the ceremony along with other relatives.However, the BJP criticized the absence of members of the Gandhi family during the immersion.

He was behaving like a bouncer, not like the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha , a post once occupied by great personalities like Vajpayee ji,"" BJP MP added.Sarangi alleged that Gandhi's actions caused MP Mukesh Rajput to lose balance and fall, leading to Sarangi’s own injury. ""Rajput ji fell on me, and my head struck a hard surface, possibly a stone-like object, resulting in a deep cut,"" he recounted, mentioning that his head injury required stitches.When asked if Gandhi showed concern afterward, Sarangi acknowledged that the Congress leader briefly approached him but left quickly.
