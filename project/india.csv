NEW DELHI : The Supreme Court has granted interim bail to social activist Jyoti Jagtap in the Elgar Parishad case.A bench of Justices M M Sundresh and Satish Chandra Sharma on Wednesday granted her the relief till the next date of hearing in Feb next year, after senior advocate Aparna Bhat told the court that the activist has been in jail for more than five years.According to NIA chargesheet, speeches given by the accused at Elgar Parishad contributed to violence at Koregaon Bhima near Pune.

Bihar: Nitish Kumar to take oath as CM for 10th time today,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-nitish-kumar-to-take-oath-as-cm-for-10th-time-today/articleshow/125447647.cms,"Nitish Kumar To Take CM Oath For Record 10th Time At Patna's Gandhi Maidan, PM Modi To Attend

Samrat Choudhary, Vijay Sinha likely to retain deputy CM posts

PATNA/NEW DELHI: Nitish Kumar is set to take oath for an unprecedented 10th time as Bihar CM on Thursday after leading his party, JDU , and the governing bloc, NDA , to their second-best performance in the state, proving his resilience and popularity in an election where he was perceived as a vulnerable link in the alliance.Nitish and his ministerial colleagues will be sworn in at the historic Gandhi Maidan - the sprawling venue of his inauguration in 2005, and later in 2010 and 2015, before he chose the sober precincts of the Raj Bhawan as he swung between alliances and his stock fell. PM Narendra Modi , Union ministers Amit Shah and Rajnath Singh and several CMs, and allies such as N Chandrababu Naidu and Eknath Shinde will attend the ceremony.Sources said around 20 legislators may be sworn as ministers against a maximum strength of 36.Deliberations continued late on Thursday to finalise details of portfolio allocations after Shah arrived in Patna.Also read: 4 of 5 Bihar seats with max & min SIR deletions won by NDA PM Narendra Modi had not attended the ceremony in 2020, an election in which NDA barely scraped through due to the drastic fall in JDU's tally to 43 from 71 in 2015. Amit Shah and BJP president J P Nadda were then the main presence from their party.If the return to Gandhi Maidan, likely to be thronged by a big crowd of supporters, attests to Nitish Kumar's bolstered political strength after JDU's numbers soared to 85, the presence of BJP bigwigs underscores the surge in the party's confidence as well as its show of support to his leadership.BJP has emerged as the single-largest party with 89 seats.Nitish (74) was elected the leader of the NDA legislature party in a meeting of MLAs and senior leaders of its five constituents - LJP(RV), HAM(S) and RLM besides the two main parties - and he was then joined by allies in staking claim to governor Arif Mohammad Khan.BJP lawmakers re-elected Samrat Choudhary, an OBC Kushwaha, as their leader, while Vijay Kumar Sinha, a upper caste Bhumihar, was picked as his deputy, in a clear indication that they would retain the position of deputy CMs in the new govt.BJP has stuck to the backward-upper caste combination for the top two jobs from its quota, a social coalition which was the hallmark of its candidate selection in the election.BJP and JDU have held lengthy deliberations to finalise details of the new govt, with both parties agreeing to the status-quo in key positions after exchange of differing views. If there was a suggestion from some in JDU for getting the speaker's post, currently held by its ally, BJP indicated its keenness for the home department, which is administered by Nitish, sources said, adding that the existing arrangement is likely to continue.Sources said, among outgoing ministers, Nitin Nabin, Mangal Pandey, Nitish Mishra and Sanjay Saraogi may be retained from the BJP quota. JDU's Vijay Kumar Chaudhary, Lacy Singh and Shravan Kumar, too, are tipped to be sworn in as ministers again along with representatives of three other allies.After being elected BJP legislature party leader, Choudhary said the new govt would work in overdrive to fulfill the development vision of Modi and Nitish for Bihar.","Nitish Kumar set to take oath for an unprecedented 10th time as Bihar CM on Thursday.

No dispute, just different points of view: NDA neta

NEW DELHI: BJP and JDU are resisting their ally LJP(RV)'s demand for deputy chief minister position in the new Bihar govt, which will be sworn in on Thursday.Leaders of the two main NDA parties held long discussions on Tuesday, with sources indicating that BJP may retain the post of assembly Speaker. There is also a buzz that JDU, too, is interested in having the Speaker's chair, but sources said it was more an expression of aspirations as the two allies worked out the details of the new govt.It is learnt that Union minister Chirag Paswan-led LJP(RV), which has 19 MLAs and brings crucial Dalit votes to the alliance, is keen on having a deputy CM from its quota.BJP has two deputy CMs in the outgoing govt and is expected to keep the post to itself in the new dispensation as well. The name of Arun Bharti, the member of Lok Sabha from Jamui and Chirag's brother-in-law, was doing the rounds in political circles as LJP's choice for the position of deputy CM.Home minister Amit Shah and BJP president J P Nadda held talks with JDU working president Sanjay Jha and Lalan Singh, the regional party's presence in the Modi cabinet, as the composition of the new govt is likely to be somewhat different from the outgoing one due to the rise in JDU's numbers and entry of two new parties - LJP(RV) and Upendra Kushwaha's Rashtriya Lok Morcha.It is natural for allies to have different points of view in thrashing out the details of a govt with five parties. But there is no dispute,"" a key functionary said.National Democratic Alliance won a thumping majority by bagging 202 seats in the 243-member assembly. BJP emerged as the single largest party with 89 seats, while JDU is close behind with 85. This contrasts starkly with the outgoing assembly in which BJP had 80 MLAs and JDU 43. This reflected in the power equation in the current govt in which BJP has 21 ministers as against 14 from its allies, including Nitish and an Independent MLA.This is for the first time that BJP and JDU have nearly equal strength. Until its number declined sharply in 2020, JDU was the dominant partner since they won their first state poll together in 2005. However, BJP has always endorsed Nitish's leadership.HAM(S) and RLM, having five and four MLAs each, are expected to get one berth in the new govt, while Paswan's party may bag two to three ministerial positions.BJP has two deputy CMs, one Kushwaha (OBC) and one Bhumihar (upper caste), in the outgoing govt. The party on Tuesday named an observer and two co-observers for the meeting of its legislature party to elect their leader. The choice of its three central leaders is rich on social messaging with Uttar Pradesh deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya, a prominent OBC face of the party in the state, being joined by Union law minister Arjun Ram Meghwal, a Dalit, and former Union minister Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti, who comes from most backward Nishad caste.Deputy CM Samrat Chaudhary, who has seen as a rapid rise in BJP, is current legislature party leader and is being seen as a frontrunner for the position again.A joint meeting of NDA parties is expected to elect Nitish as their leader on Wednesday. PM Narendra Modi and Union ministers Rajnath Singh and Amit Shah besides other NDA heavyweights will be joining the oath-taking ceremony to be held in Patna's sprawling Gandhi Maidan in the presence of a big crowd.","BJP and JDU are resisting their ally LJP(RV)'s demand for deputy chief minister position in the new Bihar govt.

Delhi’s Fake ‘Professor’ and Team Pulled Off a ₹50 Crore Money Heist Inspired by Netflix Crime Drama

8 special teams to probe case

BENGALURU: In one of the well-scripted daring daylight dacoities in Bengaluru, five to six miscreants posing as RBI officials looted Rs 7.1 crore from an armoured cash van from a busy flyover in south Bengaluru on Wednesday afternoon.The incident took place between 12.30pm and 1pm when the van, owned by CMS Info Systems, was moving cash in three boxes from HDFC Bank in JP Nagar to HBR Layout, 22km away. The stunning drama involved an MUV, two hatchbacks and the CMS-run armoured van.Read also: Bengaluru horror: Fake police hold cat at knifepoint, rob woman via UPI The drama started when a hatchback, a Maruti Zen, blocked the cash van near Ashoka Pillar, Jayanagar 2nd Block, around 12.30pm. Besides driver Binod Kumar, there were three occupants in the van: custodian Aftab and gunmen Rajanna & Tammaiah.Three men sprang out of the hatchback, which was tailed by an Innova, an MUV, and directed the van occupants : ""We are RBI officials. There is a complaint against your firm for violating RBI guidelines. We have to record your statements.""The CMS staff readily believed the imposters. The two gunmen Rajanna and Tammaiah left their licensed single-barrel guns in the vehicle and entered the MUV along with the custodian.One of the miscreants advised the cash van driver to go to Dairy Circle flyover — about 3km from Ashoka Pillar — and wait for “the RBI officials”. While Kumar drove ahead, the MUV with the CMS staff and miscreants closely followed the van. On reaching Nimhans junction, the MUV stopped.The miscreants directed the three CMS staffers to disembark: “Come to the police station and we’ll take your statements. Before that, we should take the cash boxes to the RBI.”The CMS staffers walked in the direction of Siddapura police station. Driver Kumar drove up to Dairy Circle flyover and waited there.“Soon, the MUV with miscreants stopped near Kumar. At gunpoint, miscreants shifted the cash boxes into another hatchback — a Maruti WagonR — for inspection by RBI. In the blink of an eye, the miscreants sped away, leaving behind Kumar, his van, and their MUV,” a police officer said.Read more: Bengaluru man slits estranged daughter-in-law’s throat in her sleep over unpaid loan; arrested Bengaluru City police commissioner Seemanth Kumar Singh said they are probing the case from all angles. “Unfortunately, there was a delay in CMS approaching us.

Police discovered the licence plate (KA-03-NC-8052) was fake, and it is of a sedan owned by a person in Kalyannagar.Nataraj, senior security adviser from CMS, said he didn’t suspect any of his staffers and added that police investigation will reveal the men behind it.
