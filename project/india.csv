Big INDIA bloc parties reject smaller allies' plea to find a way to let Parliament run,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/big-india-bloc-parties-reject-smaller-allies-plea-to-find-a-way-to-let-parliament-run/articleshow/123127569.cms,"NEW DELHI: As the opposition's protest seeking a discussion on the special intensive revision (SIR) of Bihar electoral rolls has brought Parliament to a halt, some members in the INDIA bloc ranks Tuesday urged the alliance brass to find a way to run Parliament, but their plea was shot down.Sources said at the meeting of the INDIA bloc on Tuesday morning, CPM's John Brittas, RSP's NK Premachandran and IUML's ET Mohammed Basheer felt that the Parliament session should not be washed out. While Brittas is a Rajya Sabha MP, Basheer and Premachandran are in Lok Sabha.However, their plea was countered strongly by the bigger parties of the bloc like Congress , DMK, TMC, SP, Shiv Sena, RJD, who felt the govt cannot get away by evading a discussion on a politically critical issue like the electoral rolls review. With the opposition programmes targeting the Election Commission lined up in coming days - dinner meeting at Rahul Gandhi's residence on Thursday, Bangalore protest led by Rahul on Friday, and the joint march to EC on Aug 11 - the opposition is unlikely to relent till then.A wider consensus to raise a protest over the electoral roll revision was evolved last week after a discussion on Pahalgam-Operation Sindoor in the two Houses over three days.As they gathered to chart out the future strategy, SIR came to dominate the discussion. Opposition leaders were told by Rahul that issues being raised in Parliament were important but BJP was winning elections by manipulating the electoral rolls.He told INDIA bloc members that a ""deep dive"" on voters' list done by Congress in a sample Bangalore seat has unearthed serious irregularities, and the govt should be forced to discuss the subject in Parliament. Since then, the opposition has mounted vigorous protests in the parliament every morning.","Opposition's protest seeking a discussion on the special intensive revision (SIR) of Bihar electoral rolls has brought Parliament to a halt.
