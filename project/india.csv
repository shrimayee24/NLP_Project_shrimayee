VARANASI: The country continues to bless BJP-led NDA as it works without discrimination and with good intentions, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Sunday in Varanasi on his second visit after retaining his LS constituency this summer and less than a fortnight after the governing combine's Haryana hattrick.Modi targeted Congress and Samajwadi Party (SP) for their ""dynastic, discriminatory and appeasement"" politics.""They discriminated in development, but our government believes in Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas ,"" Modi said at Varanasi Sports Complex, Kashi, after opening and kicking off 23 projects worth Rs 6,700 crore.The PM reeled off his government's signature achievements as he explained why Haryana retained BJP and the party received record votes in J&K polls. ""We do what we say. A grand Ram temple has been built in Ayodhya and millions visit daily. We fulfilled the promise of women's reservation, liberated Muslim daughters from social evils like triple talaq, and gave constitutional status to the OBC commission with 10% reservation for the poor.""Accusing Congress and SP of having neglected Varanasi for years, Modi said, ""Why did the colourful cultural city, Kashi, which houses the sacred Jyotirlinga of Lord Shiva, salvation site of Manikarnika, and knowledge site of Sarnath, remain deprived of development and neglected for decades?""Those who governed UP and Delhi for long never cared for Varanasi due to dynastic and appeasement politics, Modi said.He recalled his Independence Day speech to bring one lakh youths with no political background into politics to change Indian politics, eradicate corruption and nepotism. ""I appeal to the youths of UP and Kashi to be part of this new political journey,"" Modi said. The PM indicated that he hit the ground running when he started his third term this summer, pointing out that his govt ""started working with triple pace"". ""In just over 125 days, projects worth over Rs 15 lakh crore have been initiated, with a significant portion allocated for the poor, farmers, and youth,"" Modi said.","Modi targeted Congress and Samajwadi Party for their ""dynastic, discriminatory and appeasement"" politics.

Maharashtra muddle? Congress cancels 2 meets as Aaditya talks to Pawar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maharashtra-muddle-congress-cancels-2-meets-as-aaditya-talks-to-pawar/articleshow/114406004.cms,"Sharad Pawar (left), and Uddhav Thackeray

MUMBAI: Crucial meetings of the AICC's central election and screening committees scheduled for Sunday were abruptly cancelled owing to a lack of consensus on MVA's seat-sharing formula. These panels will meet in a day or two.According to a Congress office-bearer, the party is prepared for any eventuality if there is no agreement on seat sharing. Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut has echoed a similar sentiment, saying anything can happen in politics.Seat sharing talks had resumed late on Saturday after AICC's Maharashtra in-charge Ramesh Chennithala met Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray and NCP (SP) supremo Sharad Pawar to defuse the situation. Sena (UBT) MLA Aaditya Thackeray , along with Sena (UBT) MLC Anil Parab, too, met Pawar. Sena (UBT) functionaries said this meeting was to discuss the MVA manifesto, but political observers noted that the tiff over seats hasn't been fully resolved, especially between Sena (UBT) and Congress. On Sunday, Uddhav also called for a meeting of party functionaries at Matoshree, the Thackerays' residence, but no candidate list was declared by any MVA party.Since no solution had been found when its committees' members met on Sunday, AICC deployed former minister and CWC member Naseem Khan to meet Pawar to resolve the dispute. ""I had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar on the disputed seats. Since he is an architect of MVA, he spoke to both Uddhav Thackeray and Sanjay Raut. I am sure following the intervention of Sharad Pawar, the dispute will be resolved soon,"" he told TOI.Recently, Congress had reviewed all assembly seats and identified 288 nominees.MVA constituents had met on seven occasions in recent times. All the meetings were attended by MPCC president Nana Patole, Raut and NCP (SP)'s Jayant Patil, but there was a lack of consensus owing to Sena (UBT) and NCP (SP)'s ""unrealistic demands"".""Their (Sena (UBT) and NCP (SP)) demands are unrealistic. They have demanded seats where their presence is almost zero,"" a Congress functionary said.","MVA constituents had met on seven occasions in recent times.

"Scarred by Haryana loss, Congress focusing on 'rebel factor' in Maharashtra",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/scarred-by-haryana-loss-congress-focusing-on-rebel-factor-in-maharashtra/articleshow/114406806.cms,"Mallikarjun Kharge (left), and Rahul Gandhi

NEW DELHI: Scarred by the Haryana debacle, Congress now is focusing on the "" rebel factor "" in the ensuing Maharashtra polls .Sources said the appointment of senior leaders as observers in each region of the state is for the primary objective of controlling disappointed ticket aspirants from turning rebels, and persuade them to stay loyal with the promise of future accommodation.The party managers appointed as observers will be given the specific brief to focus on reining in members who may want to challenge the official party nominees.While Congress appoints special observers in every election, those named for Maharashtra are known members with vast experience and also a robust social profile. Besides, two or three observers have been appointed for each of the five regions - like Ashok Gehlot and Karnataka home minister G Parameshwara for Mumbai/Konkan region, former CMs Bhupesh Baghel and Charanjit Singh Channi, and leader of opposition in MP Umang Singhar for Vidarbha, Sachin Pilot and senior Telangana minister Uttam Reddy for Marathwada, among others. The party has also appointed AICC office-bearers with local roots - Mukul Wasnik and Avinash Pande - as senior coordinators.A Congress manager said the ""concern"" about rebels is compounded by the fact that ticket aspirants who lose out in the final decision, are easy targets for rivals, who provoke them and even sponsor them into taking the plunge to damage Congress.Much to its woes, Congress found that rebels damaged the prospects of official candidates in key constituencies in Haryana. Thus, the party is paying special attention to this part of micro-management after the shock defeat, as it moves to the crucial contest in Maharashtra. The senior observers, because of their profile and proximity to the leadership, would have the political weight to make promises to rebellious leaders to convince them to drop the ante.",Congress appoints senior leaders as observers in each region of the state.

‘BJP is not confident of going into Maharashtra poll with new faces’

MUMBAI: BJP made its preference for the old guard clear on Sunday as it named 71 sitting MLAs in its first list of 99 candidates for the Maharashtra assembly polls. Some found themselves on the list despite their losses in this year's LS polls. In all, 13 women, including four debutants, were given tickets.BJP is part of Mahayuti bloc, which is yet to announce its seat-sharing pact.Deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis was nominated for the sixth time. Rajya Sabha MP Ashok Chavan's daughter Srijaya was nominated from the family's traditional seat Bhokar in Nanded district.Political observers said the decision to repeat sitting MLAs, unlike in Haryana where the party replaced many sitting MLAs, clearly indicated that BJP was not confident of going into elections with new faces. “It also indicates that RSS and its various organisations are actively involved in the decision-making process,” said an observer requesting anonymity.State BJP chief Chandrashekhar Bawankule , who belongs to the Teli community, has been given a ticket from home constituency Kamthi in Vidarbha . In 2019, he was denied a ticket to contest the poll, resulting in huge resentment within the community. In the recent polls, the defeat of Ramdas Tadas from Wardha had also upset the community, said sources.Chandrakant Patil, who was nominated from Kothrud in 2019, causing huge resentment among BJP workers in Pune, was renominated from the same seat.Cabinet minister Sudhir Mungantiwar, who contested the LS polls and lost, has been picked for Ballarpur constituency in Chandrapur district, where he is the sitting MLA. Similarly, Mihir Kotecha, who lost from Mumbai North-East in the LS polls, has been given the ticket from Mulund, where he is the sitting MLA.Ganpat Gaikwad, MLA from Kalyan East, who is in jail for firing at Shiv Sena functionary Mahesh Gaikwad, was replaced by his wife Sulabha Gaikwad, while Babanrao Pachpute was replaced by his wife Pratibha Pachpute for the Srigonda assembly seat.The renomination of Patil, as well as Madhuri Misal from Parvati in Pune, came as a huge surprise. Former corporator from Pune Srinath Bimale was keen to contest from Parvati, while former corporator Ujwal Keskar was trying hard for Kothrud.In Mumbai where it has 16 MLAs, the party announced 14 candidates, including ex-corporator Vinod Shelar, brother of BJP Mumbai unit chief Ashish Shelar, who will contest from Malad West in place of Ramesh Singh Thakur, who lost to Congress’s Aslam Shaikh in 2019. BJP has not announced candidates for Borivli, Versova and Ghatkopar East it won in 2019. “It means there are questions being raised about the sitting MLAs Sunil Rane, Bharati Lavekar and Parag Shah. In fact, during Navratri, there were only former MLA Prakash Mehta’s banners all across Ghatkopar East,” said a party source.Ashish Shelar said his brother has been a corporator and worker for the party for the last 30 years and is originally from RSS. In Navi Mumbai, the party retained Manda Mhatre from Belapur, refusing to concede to senior politician Ganesh Naik’s demand to nominate his son, Sanjeev, from the seat. Ganesh was nominated from Airoli assembly seat.","BJP named 71 sitting MLAs in its first list of 99 candidates for the Maharashtra assembly polls.

The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections , which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases. The results will be declared on November 23, along with Maharashtra.In the Tribal-dominated state, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and CM Hemant's Soren Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) are in a direct fight, while the Congress party and Lalu Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) are in alliance with the JMM.The JMM-Congress-RJD alliance are also reportedly seeking to deal with Left parties, Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party and other tribal outfits that have been contesting the elections in the state as independent entities and make efforts to field candidates against the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) on all 81 seats collectively.In the last assembly polls in 2019, the JMM-Congress-RJD alliance won a comfortable majority of 47 seats in a House of 81.The BJP slipped to 25 seats from 37 it held in 2014. The poor performance was perceived to be the outcome of its decision to contest alone backfiring. The party did not foster an alliance with the Ajsu in the 2019 polls when Raghubar Das, currently the Odisha governor, was serving the state as CM.In this year's Lok Sabha polls in Jharkhand, the BJP-led NDA secured nine out of the 14 seats, with the BJP winning eight and its alliance partner, the Ajsu (All Jharkhand Students Union) Party, retaining its single seat.On the other hand, the opposition India bloc improved its tally, increasing its seat count from two in 2019 to five in the parliamentary polls.BJP and JMM have spruced up their pace of campaigning from the ground zero to social media. BJP and JMM leaders are actively rebutting and challenging each other on a range of issues, including illegal immigration, youth welfare, employment and housing.INDIA bloc parties in Jharkhand slammed the EC for holding assembly elections in the state along with that of Maharashtra but claimed that they were ready to slug it out with BJP-led NDA, which has welcomed the announcement of poll dates.JMM, Congress, and CPI (ML-L) said the announcement showed that EC was in a hurry to conduct elections though the assembly tenure was due to end in January next year.Also, both the INDIA bloc and BJP-led NDA are expected to get into huddles to discuss the modalities of seat-sharing which is going to be a challenge for both the competing teams.","The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections, which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra. Elections in Maharashtra will be held in single phase on November 20. The counting of votes will be on November 23.Maharashtra is gearing up for elections as the two major political alliances—the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) and the Mahayuti—prepare to face each other for the first time in a Vidhan Sabha election.The Maha Vikas Aghadi, comprise of the Congress, the Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray), and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) under Sharad Pawar, will go head-to-head with the Mahayuti , which includes the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Shiv Sena faction led by Eknath Shinde, and the NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar. This will be the first electoral contest between these two alliances since the splits within the Shiv Sena and NCP.The MVA is hopeful of replicating its recent Lok Sabha success, while the Mahayuti aims to retain power by leveraging its populist schemes targeted at women and youth. Both alliances have set their sights on winning the state.Narayan Rane, a former Union Minister and the victor in the Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg Lok Sabha constituency, is poised to be a key figure for the BJP in the Konkan region during the forthcoming elections. Meanwhile, two constituencies are expected to be critical battlegrounds: chief minister Eknath Shinde's Kopri-Pachpakdi seat in Thane City and Worli in Mumbai, where Aaditya Thackeray, a leader of the Shiv Sena (UBT), is seeking reelection.In the last Vidhan Sabha elections in 2019, the BJP secured 26.1% of the votes, the Congress 16.1%, the NCP 16.9%, and the Shiv Sena 16.6%. The BJP and the Shiv Sena (then united) formed the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which secured a majority. However, the coalition soon crumbled due to disagreements over government formation, plunging the state into a political crisis.After no party could establish a government, Maharashtra was placed under President's rule.
