'Your Future Is Being Stolen': Rahul Gandhi's Bold Message to India's Gen Z For Democratic Change

NEW DELHI: Disproportionate focus on SIR/vote chori at the cost of crucial local issues of cost of living, migration and corruption was cited by some senior functionaries as a reason for the decimation of Congress in Bihar, as they urged the central leadership to fix accountability for the defeat if the party is serious about reviving itself in the state.Some local functionaries listed three reasons for the defeat: govt's payment of Rs 10,000 to women during the polls, booth manipulations and a lack of coordination among partners. The AIMIM was also blamed for division of minority votes in Seemanchal region and beyond. It was alleged that BJP had used a ""basket of tools"" to ""fix"" the polls which spanned SIR, EVMs, the buying of votes and use of the administration against opposition candidates. Days after the Bihar debacle, the AICC brass of Mallikarjun Kharge, Rahul Gandhi and KC Venugopal held a review of the poor show with poll candidates and MPs.Around 70 members met the leadership in batches. Before the meetings started and top netas arrived, two losing candidates were reported to have clashed over the reasons for the defeat - with one taking exception to the other advocating violence against ""outsiders"" who got party tickets.Some claimed that the idea of meeting the state functionaries in batches was also to avoid a potential clash in a large gathering.A politician is said to have found fault with the manner of candidate selection which, he said, cost the party heavily. He is said to have told Rahul Gandhi that just like he had taken responsibility for the defeat in 2019 Lok Sabha polls and stepped down as party president, heads should roll in the state too - in what was a veiled jibe at AICC in-charge Krishna Allavaru - an issue that was also raised by other members, sources said. A section of party members also targeted the alliance with RJD, saying the ally brings some votes but also polarises other communities. It was also demanded that Congress break the alliance with RJD. However, at one group meeting, Rahul is said to have rebuffed it by asking why the party failed on seats that witnessed ""friendly fights"" with Congress and RJD in the fray against each other.Questions were asked about the weightage given by Congress to caste census with arguments that victory of candidates from individual upper castes is vastly higher than their population share, while that from some large OBC communities is just in line with their numbers - in a veiled reference to the advocacy of ""share as per population"" slogan.","Some local functionaries listed three reasons for the defeat: govt's payment of Rs 10,000 to women during the polls, booth manipulations and a lack of coordination among partners.

"Cong reviews Bihar debacle; contestants flag Rs 10,000 transfer, delay in seat-sharing, 'vote chori'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cong-reviews-bihar-debacle-contestants-flag-rs-10000-transfer-delay-in-seat-sharing-vote-chori/articleshow/125620916.cms,"PM Modi Reveals Why NDA Swept Bihar, Says Emotional Mode And 24x7 Development Win Elections In India

NEW DELHI: Several of the Congress leaders who contested the recent Bihar assembly elections conveyed to the party's top brass on Thursday that the NDA government's Rs 10,000 transfer to women beneficiaries, delay in seat-sharing deal among the Mahagathbandhan allies, internal rift and ""electoral malpractices"" were among the reasons for the poll debacle.Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, former party chief Rahul Gandhi and AICC general secretary in-charge organisation K C Venugopal met the candidates to hold a review meeting with them days after the Bihar election defeat.The three top leaders met the candidates in batches of 10.Later, they also deliberated on the reasons for the massive defeat with senior state leaders, including Bihar Congress chief Rajesh Ram, AICC leader in-charge of Bihar Krishna Allavaru, Congress MPs Akhilesh Prasad Singh and Tariq Anwar, and Independent MP from Purnia Pappu Yadav.There were some reports of an altercation between two candidates during the review meeting. However, Pappu Yadav refuted them and said these reports were ""false"".After the meeting, Venugopal said the four-hour review meeting made one thing absolutely clear -- the Bihar election was not a genuine mandate; it was a grossly managed and fabricated outcome.""They highlighted how SIR (Special Intensive Revision) enabled targeted voter deletions and dubious additions, how blatant cash bribery under the so-called MMRY (Mukhyamantri Mahila Rojgar Yojana) scheme was used to influence voters even at the polling stations and how identical margins across constituencies exposed a pattern that no independent election commission would ever overlook,"" Venugopal said on X.""These issues point to organised electoral malpractices and brazen violations of the Model Code of Conduct, carried out under the watch of an ECI that has increasingly behaved like an active collaborator in BJP's election rigging,"" he said.What happened in Bihar is nothing short of a direct assault on democracy, Venugopal alleged.""The Congress Party will not allow this stolen mandate to become the new normal. The fight to protect India's democracy continues -- fearlessly, relentlessly, and with the people by our side,"" he said.The Congress' Araria MLA, Abidur Rahman, said, ""There were several reasons for the defeat. The first reason is that 10,000 rupees were given in violation of the model code of conduct. The alliance could not be formed at the right time. There was a friendly contest in 10-11 seats, which sent the wrong message to the public.""""The alliance should have been formed on time. The spread of religious and caste frenzy had an impact,"" he said, and also cited AIMIM's strong performance in the Seemanchal belt of Bihar.The situation was such that if a man voted for the Congress, his wife voted for the NDA, Rahman said, elaborating on the impact of the transfer of Rs 10,000 to women beneficiaries.There was discord between the old and young party leaders, Rahman claimed.Another contestant Tauqeer Alam said that the leadership met the candidates in groups of 10 and held a discussion on the reasons for the defeat.The Congress won only six of the 61 seats it contested in the Bihar Assembly elections.Its state unit president Rajesh Kumar lost from the Kutumba seat, legislature party leader in the outgoing Assembly, Shakeel Ahmed Khan, was defeated by JD(U) candidate Dulal Chandra Goswami from the Kadwa seat by a margin of 18,368 votes.The six Congress candidates who won are Surendra Prasad (Valmiki Nagar), Abhisekh Ranjan (Chanpatia), Manoj Bishwas (Forbesganj), Abidur Rahman (Araria), Mohd Qamrul Hoda (Kishanganj) and Manohar Prasad Singh (Manihari).","Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, former party chief Rahul Gandhi and AICC general secretary in-charge organisation K C Venugopal met the candidates to hold a review meeting with them days after the Bihar election defeat.

"MLA Rahul Mamkootathil under fire again: Kerala woman files sexual assault plaint with CM; produces chats, audio proof",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/woman-submits-sexual-assault-complaint-against-congress-mla-rahul-mamkootathil/articleshow/125622660.cms,"(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A woman on Thursday submitted a sexual assault complaint to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan against suspended Congress MLA Rahul Mamkootathil, days after an audio recording of a purported phone conversation between the two surfaced. The MLA is allegedly heard pressuring the woman to undergo an abortion and threatening her for not complying in the audio clip.The woman met Vijayan at his office in the govt secretariat and submitted the complaint along with evidence. She has reportedly handed over a pen drive containing WhatsApp chats and audio recordings of alleged conversations between her and Rahul. The meeting lasted almost 45 minutes and Vijayan is learned to have assured her of prompt and proper action.The CM has forwarded the complaint to the state police chief and it will now be referred to the crime branch, which is likely to record the complainant's statement soon.The development comes months after Rahul faced multiple allegations of sexual misconduct. Responding to it, the Palakkad MLA said he would fight the case legally. ""As long as I am convinced that I have done no wrong, I will continue to fight legally. I will prove everything in the court of law as well as in the court of the people.Truth will prevail...,"" he wrote on his Facebook page. There are reports that Rahul will seek anticipatory bail.The crime branch had registered a suo motu case against Rahul earlier, but investigators were unable to proceed as there was no formal complaint. Police had earlier contacted the complainant when the first audio clip was leaked, but she was not ready to pursue the matter then. They will now proceed with the investigation after recording her statement.Congress leaders maintained that the party had already taken action against Rahul. ""He is no longer a party member and hence the party has nothing to comment,"" KPCC president Sunny Joseph said. Opposition leader V D Satheesan said the efforts to revive the issue were part of a plan to divert attention from the Sabarimala gold scam. The matter had already been discussed in the party and action taken against the MLA, he said. No Congress leader will fall into the CPM's ploy to divert attention, he said.Earlier, Youth Congress state general secretary Sajan B Sajan lodged a complaint with the AICC and Priyanka Gandhi, demanding the appointment of an inquiry commission — including women leaders — to meet the affected women in person and examine the issue seriously. He also said Congress should dispel any suspicion that it was adopting double standards on women's issues.Rahul was suspended from the primary membership of Congress in Aug following the allegations. The Palakkad MLA had earlier resigned as Youth Congress state president after an actress, without naming him but dropping enough hints, accused ""a young leader of a prominent political party"" of misbehaviour, triggering protests by BJP and DYFI. Several women and a transgender person also levelled similar allegations against him.",A woman on Thursday submitted a sexual assault complaint to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan against suspended Congress MLA Rahul Mamkootathil.
