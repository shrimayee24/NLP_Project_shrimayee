"Rahul's claims absurd, bring into disrepute Cong's own polling reps, say EC officials",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rahuls-claims-absurd-bring-into-disrepute-congs-own-polling-reps-say-ec-officials/articleshow/121702679.cms,"Rahul Gandhi

NEW DELHI: Election Commission officials on Saturday slammed Leader of the Opposition Rahul Gandhi for accusing it of “fixing” Maharashtra polls, saying that the “absurd” allegations – already dismissed in a letter to the Congress dated Dec 24, 2024 – not only demotivate lakhs of govt staff who work untiringly to deliver transparent elections but also “bring into disrepute” party’s own representatives from the polling station to the constituency level.“Any misinformation being spread, by anyone, is a sign of disrespect towards the law, under which polls are held. After an unfavourable verdict by the voters, trying todefame the Election Commission by saying that it is compromised, is completely absurd,” an EC functionary told TOI.EC also found it strange that the LoP, instead of directly writing to the EC, has thus far chosen to air his grievances at various other forums – party meetings, Lok Sabha, even interactions on foreign soil and, now, an Op-Ed article. “If he is aggrieved, why is he shying from write to EC directly or seeking a meeting?” asked the functionary mentioned above.On Rahul faulting the appointment process of CEC and election commissioners, officials underlined that it was only under Modi govt that the law was amended to allow LoP a say in the appointments. “All CECs and election commissioners under previous Cong govts were appointed at the sole will of the Executive,” said an officer.Stating that Rahul, in his Op-ED article, has only harped on the allegations denied by the poll panel in December 2024, with additional clarifications published in TOI on April 22, EC officials rejected his charge of extraordinary surge in last two hours. It emphasised that over 6.4 crore electors in Maharashtra, who reached the polling station from 7 am to 6 pm on November 20, 2024, had voted. Thus, about 58 lakh votes were polled per hour on an average. “Going by these average trends, nearly 116 lakh voters could have voted in the last two hours. Therefore, casting of 65 lakh votes by electors in two hours is much below the average hourly voting trends,” an EC functionary pointed out.As regards the anomalies alleged by Rahul in roll revision, the functionary underlined that over 27,000 booth level agents (BLAs) appointed by the Congress were actively involved at every step of the summary revision of Maharashtra rolls ahead of the state polls, including raising claims and objections against the draft roll.Interestingly, while electors increased by 8.1% in Maharashtra since the last assembly poll, the corresponding rise was 13.4% for Jharkhand and 16.2% for Telangana. Congress won both Jharkhand (in alliance with JMM) and Telangana polls.Even after the final roll was published with a total 9.7 crore electors and its copies shared with all political parties including the Congress – allowing them to file two-point appeals, if dissatisfied – only 89 appeals were filed before the first appellate authority (district magistrate) and one before the second (chief electoral officer). “It is thus amply clear that there was no grievance of Congress or any other political party before the conduct of Maharashtra polls,” said the EC functionary.As regards allegations of irregularities in polling, EC officials shared that polling agents of all candidates and parties, including Congress, were present at the polling stations. “Congress’s nominated candidates or their authorized agents did not raise any substantiated allegations with regard to any kind of abnormal voting at the time of scrutiny before the returning officer and the election observers,” said an officer.“It appears that all these facts brought to the Congress notice by EC in its letter dated December 24, 2024, have completely been ignored,” said an EC functionary.","Election Commission officials slammed Leader of the Opposition Rahul Gandhi for accusing it of “fixing’ Maharashtra polls. “Any misinformation being spread, by anyone, is a sign of disrespect towards the law, under which polls are held.

Charges include murder, rioting, house-trespass

Communal unrest lasted days, over 300 arrested

NEW DELHI: Haragobindo Das and his son Chandan Das were dragged out of their home and brutally killed with an axe in front of their family members during the communal violence that erupted in Murshidabad in April, police said in a chargesheet filed in the case.The police on Friday submitted a 900-page chargesheet before the Jangipur court, naming 13 accused in connection with the killings and the broader violence that rocked the district.According to the chargesheet, the victims, residents of Betbona village in Zafarabad, were among three people killed during the unrest, which broke out amid protests over the Waqf (Amendment) Act in the Muslim-majority district.The 13 accused have been charged under multiple sections of the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita, including murder committed by a group, rioting, house-trespass, and house-breaking. Provisions of the Arms Act have also been invoked, a senior officer confirmed.Read: Rahul Gandhi hits back at EC: Congress MP demands voter rolls, CCTV footage; rebuts 'evasive' reply to 'match fixing' claim The chargesheet outlines in detail how the accused forcefully entered the Das family's home, attacked the father-son duo in full view of other family members, and later fled the scene. It also documents the police's efforts to track down and arrest the suspects, some of whom went into hiding immediately after the crime.The violence, which engulfed parts of Murshidabad from April 8 to 12, led to large-scale arson and destruction of property.The situation grew so volatile that the Calcutta High Court had to intervene, ordering the deployment of Central Armed Police Forces to restore order.Police have since registered over 60 FIRs across the district and arrested more than 300 individuals in connection with the riots.The trial in the Das murder case is expected to begin soon, officials said, as the court begins examining the voluminous evidence submitted by officials.","Haragobindo Das and his son Chandan Das were dragged out of their home and brutally killed with an axe in front of their family members.

Bangladesh's Supreme Court on Sunday ordered the Election Commission to restore the right-wing Jamaat-e-Islami's party registration, nearly eight months after the interim govt lifted a ban on it, clearing the way for its participation in future elections.Court officials said the SC's appellate division, led by chief justice Syed Refaat Ahmed, directed the commission to restore the party's registration.The apex court said it was up to EC to decide if Jamaat could contest polls using its traditional ""scale"" symbol.EC scrapped the registration of Jamaat, which was opposed to Bangladesh's 1971 independence from Pakistan, in Dec 2018 in line with a HC ruling.
