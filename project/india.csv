SC refuses to quash FIR but gives YouTuber relief,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-refuses-to-quash-fir-but-gives-youtuber-relief/articleshow/123572488.cms,"New Delhi: Supreme Court on Thursday granted four-week protection from arrest to journalist and YouTuber Abhisar Sharma but did not accept his plea for quashing the FIR registered by Assam police over his video accusing state govt of 'communal politics' and questioning its allotment of 3,000 acre of tribal land to a private entity. A bench of Justices Justices M M Sundresh and N Kotiswar Singh asked Sharma to move Delhi HC for dismissal of FIR.It, however, agreed to hear his plea challenging constitutional validity of Section 152 of BNS which is akin to sedition provision but turned down repeated pleas to hear his petition against the FIR. The bench was initially not inclined to entertain the plea, leading senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for the journalist to argue that another bench of SC had agreed to hear a similar plea filed by another journalist - a reference to a petition filed by Siddharth Varadarajan and Karan Thapar's petition which was entertained by the court.Sibal insisted that SC must maintain uniformity and Sharma's plea be also heard. The bench however refused the plea and granted interim protection to Sharma to enable him to approach HC. Sharma told the court that the alleged offensive video posted by him stems from a recent Guwahati HC proceeding with respect to such allotment.Refuting the allegation of ridiculing and denigrating the govts, the petitioner said his statements are not fabricated assertions but grounded in verifiable facts which were supported by original video clips of political speeches made by the Assam CM available in the public domain.","Abhisar Sharma accused state govt of 'communal politics' and questioned allotment of 3,000 acre of tribal land to a private entity.

RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat , while speaking at the event “100 Years Journey of Sangh – New Horizon” on Thursday, clarified ongoing speculation around retirement norms. He dismissed reports suggesting that he or anyone in the Sangh must step down upon reaching the age of 75.""No bar on a family person becoming RSS chief, but the person needs to devote all his time to the organisation. I never said I will retire or someone else should retire at 75 years,"" RSS chief Bhagwat said.Over the past few years, the opposition has consistently criticised the BJP for its apparent policy of not fielding candidates older than 75.This stance was allegedly based on comments made by Shah prior to the 2019 Lok Sabha election, where he stated that it was his party's decision not to give Lok Sabha poll tickets to those above 75 years of age, leading to veteran leaders like L K Advani and Murali Manohar Joshi missing out.Shah said, ""Only the media is pushing this issue. No one above 75 has been given tickets. This is the party's decision."" He made these remarks in an interview to 'The Week'.However, Shah later clarified that this was an electoral decision, emphasising, ""There is no provision regarding age, anywhere in the Constitution of the BJP.""Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal also voiced his concerns, stating, ""He ( PM Modi) will retire next year.

'Talks Are On With...': Rahul’s Wedding Remark After Tejashwi’s Tip Sparks Political Banter In Bihar

Poll Do you believe the government's response to the SSC protests was justified? Yes, they acted appropriately No, it was excessive

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday hit out at the Centre over the alleged lathicharge on Staff Selection Commission (SSC) aspirants and trainers protesting at Delhi’s Ramlila Maidan. He accused the Modi government of ignoring the concerns of the youth, alleging it had come to power by “stealing votes. ”In a post in Hindi on X, Gandhi said the lathicharge on SSC aspirants and teachers peacefully protesting at Ramlila Maidan was “not just shameful, but the hallmark of a cowardly government.”The protest, held on Sunday, saw the participation of several SSC candidates and their trainers, who were demanding transparency and better conduct of recruitment examinations. The SSC exams have faced repeated complaints of abrupt cancellations, server crashes, unresponsive systems and exam centres located as far as 500 kilometres from candidates’ homes.“The youth had only demanded their rights — employment and justice. What did they get? Lathis,” Gandhi said.He alleged that the government first manipulated elections to secure votes, then allowed irregularities in examinations, followed by failures in providing jobs and ultimately sought to suppress citizens’ rights and voices.The Congress leader further said the government does not prioritise the demands of youth, farmers, the poor, Dalits and minorities, as it does not depend on their votes. He urged people not to be afraid but to stand firm and fight back.Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge also condemned the alleged police action, claiming the Modi government had made it a “habit” to jeopardise the future of the youth.“Stealing the future of the country’s youth has become a habit of the Modi government. The brutal lathi-charge by the Modi government’s puppet police on students protesting against rigging in SSC exams at Delhi’s Ramlila Maidan is highly condemnable,” Kharge said in a post on X.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra too criticised the government, calling the use of force on protesting students “inhuman and shameful.”In her post on X, she said, “The youth of the entire country are troubled by rigging in every exam, scams in every recruitment and paper leaks. The corruption in the recruitment process and exams under the BJP rule is ruining the future of the youth.”Denying the allegations, a senior Delhi Police officer said around 1,500 protestors had gathered at the site, and about 100 refused to leave after the permitted time despite repeated requests.“Out of those who were not leaving, 44 protestors were detained. There was no lathi-charge,” the officer clarified.The SSC is a statutory body responsible for conducting recruitment examinations for various posts across ministries, departments and other government organisations.The Phase 13 exam, held between July 24 and August 1 at 194 centres in 142 cities, faced multiple disruptions. Approximately five lakh candidates appeared for the examination during this period.These issues sparked widespread protests across Delhi last week, drawing thousands of aspirants to the streets and triggering a strong backlash on social media.",Rahul Gandhi hits out at the Centre over the alleged lathicharge on Staff Selection Commission (SSC) aspirants and trainers protesting at Delhi’s Ramlila Maidan.
