'Only Mistake I Made Was...': Prajwal Revanna Tells Court Before Life Sentence In Rape Case

Poll Do you think protests will effectively change the political situation in Punjab? Yes No

PATIALA: AAP MLA Harmeet Singh Pathanmajra has allegedly escaped police custody while being taken to a local police station after his arrest.According to Punjab Police sources, Pathanmajra and his accomplices fired at police officers during the escape and even ran over one personnel, leaving him injured.According to reports, Pathanmajra and his accomplices ran over police personnel with an SUV.The Sanour MLA was arrested a day after publicly criticising his party’s Delhi leadership.His detention in Patiala was linked to a rape case filed against him, sparking political uproar in the region.In a social media post, Pathanmajra claimed the case related to his former wife and alleged that the fresh charges of rape were politically motivated.“I was booked because I raised my voice against my own government, especially the Delhi leadership,” he wrote.His brother, Hardev Singh, said the MLA was taken into custody under Section 376 of the IPC despite already having been granted bail by the Punjab and Haryana High Court. “He was arrested from Dabri in Haryana in a case where bail was already granted. This is clearly an attempt to silence him,” he alleged.CIA Patiala confirmed that three weapons have been recovered and one accomplice of MLA Pathanmajra has been arrested.The arrested individual has been identified as Balwinder Singh, while the search for MLA Pathanmajra continues.Police said two officers were injured when stones were thrown at them during the MLA’s escape attempt.Authorities added that supporters of the MLA not only pelted stones but also opened fire at the police team.Before his arrest, Pathanmajra had appealed to colleagues and supporters via Facebook to protest outside the Patiala SSP’s office at the Mini Secretariat. He urged people to reach “in tractors, trolleys, and cars” to demand his release. “I will not be silenced even if more cases are registered against me. Will AAP’s Delhi leadership rule Punjabis now? Even Congress and BJP did not interfere to this extent,” he said.The MLA has repeatedly accused the party’s central leadership of sidelining Punjab leaders and “remote-controlling” the state. Recently, he criticised officials of the Irrigation Department over flood relief efforts in his constituency. Soon after, his security cover was withdrawn and police officers in the area were reshuffled — moves that raised eyebrows.“This is retaliation. They looted Punjab more than Abdali. Now they want to sell Punjab,” Pathanmajra declared.","Harmeet Singh Pathanmajra allegedly escaped police custody while being taken to a local police station after his arrest.

Must have a thick skin if you are in politics: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/must-have-a-thick-skin-if-you-are-in-politics-sc/articleshow/123775798.cms,"NEW DELHI: Given the common practice of unfiltered accusations made in the political arena, Supreme Court on Monday had a word of advice for netas and parties: ""If you are a politician, you must have a thick skin"".A three-judge bench headed by the CJI - he comes from a political family; his father, R S Gavai, was an MP - made the remark while junking an appeal filed by Telangana BJP challenging the dismissal of its defamation suit against Congress CM Revanth Reddy over his alleged comments against the saffron party while campaigning for the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.Appearing for BJP's Telangana unit, senior advocates Ranjit Kumar and Guru Krishna Kumar said HC had held the defamation case filed against the CM was maintainable but dismissed it saying the case was filed without prior authorisation from the party. The counsel said that even if the defamation case was not maintainable, the utterances of the Congress neta during electioneering constituted an offence under Section 125 of the Representation of People Act as it promoted enmity between classes of people in the electoral context.In Aug last year, the trial court had entertained the defamation suit against Reddy. However, on an appeal filed by the CM, the Telangana HC had dismissed the defamation case, upholding Reddy's contention that no prima facie case was made out against him.HC had said, ""Even if this court were to accept that the complainant is a part of the national unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party and may be treated as a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party, the complaint is not maintainable for the lack of authorisation. ""BJP then challenged the HC order in the SC.

"HC: Treat arrest, even without exchange of fire, as encounter",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hc-treat-arrest-even-without-exchange-of-fire-as-encounter/articleshow/123775718.cms,"CHANDIGARH: In an order with wider ramifications on recruitment disputes in Punjab, Punjab and Haryana high court has held that apprehending armed militants can also be treated as an ""encounter"" for purposes of granting reservation benefits to wards of police personnel. ""It is, in fact, an achievement of police officers if they succeed in apprehending militants instead of killing them in an encounter,"" the court held, observing that successful arrest of armed militants advances the spirit of govt policy.Justice Jagmohan Bansal passed the order on Sept 4 while allowing a petition filed by Sonam Kamboj of Bathinda district, who was considered ineligible for recruitment to the Punjab police under a category reserved for wards of police personnel who have taken part in at least three encounters.In 2021, Punjab police invited applications for several posts, including sub-inspectors and intelligence officers. Kamboj, the daughter of a serving police officer, applied under the quota for wards.However, her claim was rejected by a committee constituted by the Punjab DGP, which concluded that her father had participated in only two encounters, whereas the 1996 policy laid down three. The state argued that one of the FIRs cited by the petitioner could not be treated as an encounter since no exchange of fire took place, even though four militants were arrested.As per the state, ""encounter"" means an exchange of gunfire between terrorists and police which results in a casualty.After hearing all the parties, HC held that the 1996 policy is a piece of beneficial legislation and its interpretation by Punjab govt seems to be ""pedantic and un-holistic"". The court observed that the object of the policy was to encourage as well as protect sincere and brave police officers. The expression ""encounter with terrorists"" cannot be interpreted in a way that there should be gunfire and casualty.""In the instant case, the police party was successful in apprehending four militants with arms and anti-national material. It would be unfair to conclude there was no encounter with terrorists because no casualty took place in the operation,"" observed the judge. HC directed the govt to grant a police job to the petitioner within six weeks.",Petitioner Sonam Kamboj was considered ineligible for recruitment to the Punjab police under a category reserved for wards of police personnel who have taken part in at least three encounters.

UP assembly reinstates NDA’s lone Muslim MLA: Abbas Ansari regains Mau Sadar; SBSP tally rises to six,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/up-assembly-reinstates-mla-abbas-ansari/articleshow/123772719.cms,"Abbas Ansari





LUCKNOW: The UP assembly on Monday restored the membership of Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party MLA Abbas Ansari, 18 days after Allahabad high court overturned his conviction in a 2022 hate speech case. Abbas, MLA from Mau Sadar, is the son of late gangster-politician Mukhtar Ansari who died in Banda jail in 2024.Principal secretary, Vidhan Sabha, Pradeep Dubey, in an order issued Monday evening said Abbas membership was deemed restored as the high court had suspended his conviction. The order said the cancellation of his membership stood ""ineffective"" under article 191 of the Constitution, read with section 8 of the Representation of People's act, 1951. Abbas was disqualified as MLA in May this year after a special court in Mau sentenced him to two years imprisonment for a hate speech. He was found guilty under Section 153-A (promoting enmity between groups), Section 189 (threat to public servant), Section 506 (criminal intimidation) and 171F (undue influence during elections) of the Indian Penal Code. He was also fined Rs 2,000. His election agent, Mansopor Ansari, who was also present on the stage during the speech, was also sentenced to six months jail.Abbas moved the appellate court, which dismissed his challenge on July 5. He subsequently approached the Allahabad high court which quashed the conviction.The Supreme Court had granted interim bail to Abbas Ansari in Mar this year in a case under the Gangsters Act.The controversy arose after Abbas delivered a speech during the 2022 assembly elections, allegedly warning the govt officials of the consequences if Samajwadi Party came to office. SBSP was an ally of the SP during the 2022 assembly polls though it later joined the BJP govt.""I have told SP chief Akhilesh Yadav that after (SP) govt formation no transfer or posting of bureaucrats will be done for six months. First there will be a `hisab-kitab' (scores will be settled), only then will transfer take place,"" he is reported to have said.Following restoration of Ansari's membership, the strength of SBSP will increase to six again. Abbas is again the lone Muslim MLA in the BJP-led NDA camp in UP.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to visit Punjab on Tuesday to assess the damage caused by heavy monsoon floods that have affected thousands across the state.The flood situation has worsened, with the death toll rising to 51, up from 46 on Sunday, according to the Department of Information and Public Relations, Punjab.Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann, who is recovering at a private hospital in Mohali, welcomed the PM’s visit and expressed hope for adequate relief measures.In a late Tuesday evening social media post, Mann wrote, ""I welcome him. I am unwell, otherwise, I would have personally come to make him inspect flood-affected areas. I hope that the Prime Minister will announce an adequate package or make an announcement to give relief for the losses suffered by Punjab and Punjabis due to the natural calamity.""In the CM's absence, Punjab AAP president and cabinet minister Aman Arora and agriculture minister Gurmeet Singh Khudian are expected to meet the PM during the Gurdaspur review meeting.

Jakhar said that Modi is also scheduled to meet flood-affected residents at the meeting venue.A senior Punjab Police officer said that while the PM’s visit is primarily for an aerial survey, all arrangements are in place should a road visit become necessary due to weather conditions.""Weather permitting, it will be an aerial survey only. In case there is inclement weather and he takes to the road route, all arrangements are in place,"" the officer said.Punjab’s ruling AAP has accused the Centre of “not taking any steps"" and withholding a ""rightful share” of Rs 60,000 crore owed to the state. However, Jakhar defended the central government, highlighting the assistance provided by the Army, Air Force, and NDRF in rescue operations. He further said that both the Prime Minister and Union Home Minister Amit Shah have held telephonic discussions with the CM regarding the flood situation.“Criticising the PM for not taking to social media is not correct,” Jakhar said, adding, “Had the PM put out a tweet, he would have been accused of doing nothing but merely tweeting.” Union Agriculture Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and central teams have already visited the flood-hit areas, Jakhar added.Punjab BJP working president Ashwani Sharma posted on X that the visit sends a clear message that ""the central govt stands with us in Punjab’s pain and suffering"". He added, ""The terrible floods that struck Punjab have severely affected the farmers, labourers, and common citizens of Punjab.
