17th woman to hold CM's post in independent India

NEW DELHI: New chief minister, Atishi , will continue to hold the 13 portfolios that she had earlier, including finance, planning, power, water, revenue, and public works department, while Saurabh Bharadwaj will have eight and new face Mukesh Kumar Ahlawat will handle five ministries.Apart from the ministries he held in the Kejriwal govt, Bharadwaj has been given charge of two more, social welfare and cooperatives, which were held by Raaj Kumar Anand, who quit the govt and party earlier this year.Mukesh Kumar Ahlawat, the new face in the council of ministers, has been assigned the remaining five departments that Anand held, including labour, employment, and SC&ST welfare.Gopal Rai, Kailash Gahlot, and Imran Hussain will retain the portfolios they held in the last govt. While Rai's three departments included environment and development, Gahlot will have the charge of five, including home, transport and women and child development, while Hussain will have two - food and supply, and election.Atishi was sworn in as the eighth chief minister of Delhi on Saturday at an event at Raj Niwas, replacing her mentor and AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal, who resigned from the post earlier this week. At 43, she's the second youngest CM of Delhi after Chaudhary Brahm Prakash (34) in 1952-55 and the youngest among the three women CMs -- Sheila Dikshit and Sushma Swaraj being the other two -- that the city has seen to date.Along with Atishi, five ministers also took oath, including four - Gopal Rai, Kailash Gahlot, Saurabh Bharadwaj and Imran Hussain - from the previous dispensation, and Mukesh Kumar Ahlawat, a new entrant to the Cabinet. She and others were administered the oath of office and secrecy by LG VK Saxena.Atishi has also become the 17th woman to hold the post of a chief minister in independent India. A first-time legislator, Atishi will have a brief stint of just five months as CM in this term.Before swearing in as CM, Atishi, along with her cabinet ministers, called on outgoing CM Kejriwal at his residence and held a brief discussion. Soon after taking oath, Atishi took blessings from Kejriwal by touching his feet. Former deputy CM Manish Sisodia, Delhi assembly Speaker Ram Niwas Goel, leader of opposition Vijender Gupta and police commissioner Sanjay Arora also attended the ceremony, as did her parents, Vijay Singh and Tripta Wahi, who were professors at Delhi University.Addressing a press conference soon after taking oath, Atishi said it was an ""emotional day"" for her as her ""guru"" and Delhi's son Kejriwal will not continue to be CM. She urged people to ensure Kejriwal returned to the top post again after the assembly polls in the capital in Feb 2025.LG Saxena extended his best wishes to Atishi and her council of ministers in a post on X after the event. ""May they work for the betterment of Delhi and its people,"" he wrote. The new govt is likely to prove its majority in the 70-member assembly in a special session on Sept 26-27. Atishi has been elevated to the top post at a crucial time for AAP, which is looking to retain office in Delhi for the third consecutive term, in polls scheduled early next year.With assembly polls around the corner, the new AAP govt is likely to have a challenging stint. Apart from playing a balancing act with the LG and bureaucrats, the new CM will also be expected to fast-track pending policies and schemes of public welfare, including the rollout of the Mahila Samman Nidhi Yojana, and relaunching the flagship doorstep delivery of services scheme.","Atishi was sworn in as the eighth chief minister of Delhi on Saturday.

I want to ask every Sikh brother and sister in India and abroad - is there anything wrong in what I have said? Shouldn't India be a country where every Sikh - and every Indian - can freely practice their religion without fear?"" Gandhi wrote.""As usual, the BJP is resorting to lies.They are desperate to silence me because they cannot stand the truth. But I will always speak up for the values that define India: our unity in diversity, equality, and love,"" he added.Soon after Gandhi's social media post, BJP leader Shezad Poonawalla claimed that the Leader of Opposition (LoP) was 'brazenly' defending his remarks and justifying them.Poonawala said, ""Chori aur upar se seenazori.

Instead of apologising for his remarks, when the entire Sikh community has been reacting to his remarks in the US and expressing outrage, Rahul Gandhi is brazenly defending his remarks and justifying it.""""No Sikh community is supporting Rahul Gandhi. The support is coming from the 'seek for justice' banned group. Rahul Gandhi did not once condemn the support from Pannun and he has been admiring that support so much so that he has been repeating all that he said all over again. Is there any limit to hypocrisy? The Congress only wants the support of the seek for justice group and that is why these things are being repeated, to instigate and to divide and rule, this is the target of Rahul Gandhi,"" he added.Meanwhile, BJP cited a joint statement of several Sikh groups to ask Congress leader Rahul Gandhi to withdraw his statement, which has allegedly created an atmosphere of fear in the country.BJP leader Manjinder Singh Sirsa said that several Sikh and gurdwara management bodies met minister of state for home affairs Nityanand Rai over the issue and he asserted the sacrifices of the Sikhs have made the country strong.""Today all the Sikh organisations across the country and several Sikh committees met with minister of state for home Nityanand Rai over the statement of Rahul Gandhi in the US. Rahul Gandhi should take his statement back, this is the demand of the Sikh delegation,"" Sirsa said.Read also:""I believe Rahul Gandhi will respect the sentiments of Sikhs and withdraw the statement he made in the US,"" he added.Earlier, euring his address to a gathering of Indian Americans, Rahul Gandhi accused the RSS of considering certain religions, languages, and communities as inferior to others. He said that the fight in India is not about politics but about the rights of individuals to practice their religion freely.Gandhi specifically asked a Sikh attendee, ""What is your name, brother with the turban,"" and then said, ""The fight is about whether a Sikh is going to be allowed to wear his turban in India or a kada in India. Or he, as a Sikh, is going to be able to go to a gurdwara. That's what the fight is about. And not just for him, for all religions.""""Fight is also about, I can see here in the crowd, people from Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Haryana, Telangana, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Kerala. When I say Kerala, I have been a Member of Parliament for Kerala. When I say Kerala, Kerala is a simple word, and Punjab is a simple word, but these are not simple words.

"Amit Shah accuses ‘dynastic’ NC, Congress, PDP of spreading terrorism in J&K",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amit-shah-accuses-dynastic-nc-congress-pdp-of-spreading-terrorism-in-jk/articleshow/113558189.cms,"JAMMU: Union home minister Amit Shah accused National Conference (NC), Congress, and PDP of holding democracy hostage and spreading terrorism in J&K. Speaking at an election rally in Mendhar near the LoC in Poonch district of Jammu division Saturday, Shah blamed the Abdullah, Mufti, and Nehru-Gandhi families — whom he called “dynastic leaders” — for the insurgency and violence that erupted in the region in 1989 and led to the deaths of 40,000 people.“This election is going to end the rule of three families in J&K,” Shah said.“J&K democracy was held hostage by three families. However, since 2014, Modi govt has paved the way for true democracy in the region.”Targeting NC president Farooq Abdullah, the Union minister said: “Abdullah promoted terrorism in J&K and is responsible for giving guns to the youth, destroying their future.”Shah highlighted BJP govt’s achievements in ending terrorism in Kashmir valley. “The youth here have been given laptops instead of stones. Today, BJP govt led by PM Narendra Modi has eradicated terrorism from J&K.”Shah also referenced the call by PDP and NC-Congress alliance for resumption of dialogue and diplomatic ties with Pakistan to resolve what they called the “unsettled issue” of Kashmir.“(Congress MP) Rahul Gandhi speaks of ‘Mohabbat Ki Dukan’, but issues ‘Atank ka farman’ (invitation to terrorism) by bidding for talks with Pakistan. But I say with assertion that we will not hold talks with Pakistan until it ceases terrorism. My dialogue will not be with Pakistan, but solely with my children from the hills,” Shah said.Referring to the security situation in Kashmir, Shah said: “Do you remember how much firing used to take place in J&K in the 1990s? Earlier, there used to be firing here because the masters here were afraid of Pakistan. Now, Pakistan is afraid of PM Modi. They do not have the courage to open fire, and if they do, the bullets will be answered with shells.”On the issue of reservation, Shah assured that BJP would ensure quota benefits for Pahadi, Gujjar, and Bakarwal communities. “BJP has decided that they should not only be given reservation in jobs but also in promotions. This is your right,” he said, while blaming Congress, NC, and PDP for depriving these communities of their rights.“Rahul Baba recently said in America that they will remove reservations once their party is in power. But I want to tell him that his party has always been anti-reservation. As long as BJP is there, no one can remove reservations,” he said.Shah underscored the significance of the local governance reforms under the Modi govt. “It was because of these three families that J&K didn’t see panchayat, BDC, and DDC polls for a long time. Today, over 30,000 representatives of panchayats, blocks, and districts are enjoying the fruit of democracy,” he said.Shah later addressed another rally in Surankote, urging votes for BJP and reiterating his party’s commitment to development in J&K.These are the first assembly elections in J&K in a decade and since the abrogation of Article 370 in Aug 2019 and the bifurcation of the region into two Union territories, including Ladakh. The elections are taking place against a backdrop of escalating terrorist violence. Between May 4 and Sept 13, J&K recorded 21 security force fatalities — 17 in Jammu zone and four in Kashmir valley.The first phase of the three-part elections were held across 24 constituencies on Sept 18, covering seven districts in south Kashmir and Jammu division. Voting for 26 seats will be held in the second phase on Sept 25.","Union home minister Amit Shah accused National Conference (NC), Congress, and PDP of holding democracy hostage and spreading terrorism in J&K.
