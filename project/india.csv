Can’t penalise retired employee for ‘misconduct’ without proper inquiry: HC bench,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cant-penalise-retired-employee-for-misconduct-without-proper-inquiry-hc-bench/articleshow/123928203.cms,"JAMMU: A division bench of J&K high court has quashed a govt order that directed the recovery of honorarium from the pension of a retired police officer, stating disciplinary proceedings cannot be extended beyond retirement unless backed by due process and proof of loss.A bench of Justice Sanjeev Kumar and Justice Sanjay Parihar made the ruling while hearing a petition from Sudershan Mehta, a retired deputy superintendent of police, who said he was being penalised for serving as joint secretary of Jammu & Kashmir Cricket Association (JKCA) while in service.The court said a retired person cannot be subjected to departmental proceedings for misconduct committed during service unless specific charges of negligence or fraud causing loss are established in proper inquiry. It added the govt order is clearly in violation of principles of natural justice and cannot be sustained.Senior additional advocate general Monika Kohli said Mehta had violated service conduct rules by accepting a remunerated post in JKCA between 2003 and 2016 without prior approval.Kohli cited Article 168-A of J&K Civil Service Regulations, which allowed recovery from pension for losses caused by an employee.An inquiry officer had concluded Mehta had received a monthly honorarium of Rs 12,000 in addition to his govt salary, following which the home department had ordered the recovery of the amount from his pension in Nov 2022.Mehta's counsel, Parveen Kapahi, said no charge of financial loss had been framed against him, making the recovery untenable.Dismissing the govt order, the court further said about 51 other senior officers had also held posts in sports associations without prior sanction, but no similar action was taken against them.",A bench of Justice Sanjeev Kumar and Justice Sanjay Parihar made the ruling while hearing a petition from Sudershan Mehta.

""Subjecting political parties to the POSH Act would open a Pandora's box and become a tool for blackmail,"" it said.Appearing for petitioner Yogamaya G, senior advocate Shobha Gupta told a CJI Gavai-led bench that though many women are active members of political parties, only CPM has set up an internal complaint committee (ICC) with external members. This leaves women in political parties remediless against sexual harassment.Demanding that the law must apply in equal rigour to registered parties which owe allegiance to the Constitution that mandates protection of dignity of women, including safe work atmosphere, the petitioner alleged that AAP lacks transparency about its committee while BJP and Congress have admitted to inadequate ICC structure.But, the bench asked, ""How do you equate political parties as workplace? When a person joins a political party, it is not employment. It is not a job as they join political parties on their own volition and on non-remuneration basis.

NEW DELHI: The seat-sharing negotiations for upcoming assembly elections in Bihar have become more complex as two new parties - Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and Pashupati Paras's LJP faction - joined the Mahagathbandhan alliance. The situation is getting trickier as major parties are firm on their seat demands.The 243 seats will now be divided among eight parties -- Rashtriya Janata Dal, Congress, CPI, CPM, VIP, LJP (Paras) and JMM.“Two more parties are expected to be part of the INDIA bloc soon and we all have to sacrifice our share of seats to accommodate the new partners.” State Congress president Rajesh Kumar told reporters after a discussion during a key meeting of INDIA bloc leaders at the official residence of RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav.Meanwhile, Congress insist that it cannot go below the 70 seats.VIP chief Mukesh Sahani, on the other hand, has demanded “60 seats plus the post of deputy CM” while the CPI-ML is pressing for at least 40 seats, pointing to its past performance.The RJD is also unwilling to contest on fewer than 150 seats.In 2020 assembly elections, Rashtriya Janata Dal had contested on 144 seats, of which it won 75.Congress won 19 out of 70 seats.CPI-ML contested 19 seats and won 12.CPM contested 4 seats and was successful in winning 2 seats.CPI contested on 6 seats and won 2 seats.RJD's Tejashwi Yadav has already declared himself as the CM face of the opposition INDIA bloc.Addressing the rally in Ara town, the last stopover of the 'Voter Adhikar Yatra', Tejashwi questioned the Nitish Kumar government in Bihar for ""frequently copying his ideas"" and described it as a ""copycat government"". Ridiculing the government for copying his ideas, he said that at present he was moving ahead while the govt was behind him.""Tejashwi aage-aage, Sarkar pichhe-pichhe.

"Kejriwal’s house allotment: ‘Can’t be selective’, HC tells Centre",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/kejriwals-house-allotment-cant-be-selective-hc-tells-centre/articleshow/123934818.cms,"Arvind Kejriwal





NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court on Tuesday criticised central govt for delaying the allotment of a residential accommodation to former chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in the city, noting that the approach resembled a ""free system for all"". Centre cannot selectively decide who gets a house in the national capital, it pointed out.Justice Sachin Datta demanded that central govt submit within two days the records outlining the policy governing the allotment of houses from the general pool of residential accommodation and the current waiting list.The court was hearing AAP's plea seeking directions to Centre to allot a house to Kejriwal in Delhi. Senior advocate Rahul Mehra, representing AAP, said that though the govt counsel kept taking time to seek instructions on the party's proposal to allot the bungalow at 35 Lodhi Estate to the party's national convener, it was allotted to someone else. The bungalow was vacated by BSP chief Mayawati in May.The govt's counsel had repeatedly sought adjournments, citing the unavailability of the additional solicitor general, Mehra alleged, highlighting that on the last two dates, Centre continued to delay the matter while quietly allotting the bungalow to someone else. ASG Chetan Sharma admitted that it was allotted to a minister of state and urged the court to grant some time to return with the details of the allotment.Sharma argued that a party could not demand a particular bungalow, highlighting a ""long waiting list"". The former chief minister, he said, would be allotted a house ""as and when it becomes possible"". The high court, however, directed Centre to apprise it of the specific date when 35 Lodhi Estate was allotted. ""Before Aug 26 or later, that is very crucial,"" Justice Datta remarked.""It is completely unacceptable, you have allotted 35 Lodhi Estate while you seek passovers. You are not interested in this matter. Last time, the same thing happened. Previous day also. There was a clear direction for records. The waiting list cannot deter allotment. It has never deterred in the past,"" HC said. ""I want to know the governing policy for allotment from the general pool. What is the waiting list? You cannot pick and choose. ""The AAP petition said Kejriwal had vacated his official residence at 6 Flagstaff Road on Oct 4, 2024, after stepping down as CM. Since then, he has been staying at the official residence of another party member near Mandi House, it added.","Delhi High Court criticises central govt for delaying allotment of a residential accommodation to former chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.
