TN defies HC for 2nd time in 2 days on hilltop lamp ritual,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tn-defies-hc-for-2nd-time-in-2-days-on-hilltop-lamp-ritual/articleshow/125775300.cms,"BJP state chief Nainar Nagenthran (right), party veteran H Raja (centre) and other partymen being arrested in Thiruparankundram on Thursday

MADURAI: The Karthigai Deepam issue has snowballed into a major controversy in Tamil Nadu, with the state govt Thursday defying for the second time a Madras HC order allowing lighting of the lamp at Deepathoon (a stone lamp pillar) atop Thiruparankundram hills, even as a division bench of the HC rejected its appeal against a contempt order. Meanwhile, BJP state chief Nainar Nagendran and dozens of others were detained by police during protests.State govt filed an SLP in the Supreme Court challenging the division bench order, which dismissed its appeal against a single bench order on a contempt plea.Earlier in the day, the bench of Justices G Jayachandran and K K Ramakrishnan dismissed the state’s appeal, saying it was meant to preempt contempt action. The bench upheld Justice G R Swaminathan’s orders permitting lighting of the lamp at Deepathoon with CISF protection. The single bench had also initiated contempt proceedings Wednesday after the Deepam was lit at Uchi Pillaiyar Temple, not at Deepathoon atop the hill, as directed by it on Dec 1.Despite the single-bench order on Wednesday, police had prevented the petitioner and 10 others, who had been allowed to light the lamp at Deepathoon, from proceeding to the hills citing prohibitory orders.Following the rejection of the state’s appeal Thursday, Justice Swaminathan resumed the contempt proceedings, quashed the prohibitory orders imposed by Madurai district administration, and once again permitted lighting of the lamp atop the hill, this time under protection of Madurai city police. If officials defied the order, “harsh consequences will ensue”, the judge said.However, police once again stopped the individuals from proceeding, saying it would be detrimental to public order. It was a re-enactment of the scene from Wednesday at the Thiruparankundram foothills, with hundreds of BJP workers and Hindu group activists protesting against state govt, and over 1,000 police personnel deployed. BJP’s Nagendran had an argument with police before he was detained along with several others, including H Raja and Amarprasad Reddy, and about 50 cadres to prevent them from proceeding to the hills.Meanwhile, the HC division bench will on Dec 5 take up the appeals filed by Madurai district collector and executive officer of the Subramaniya Swamy temple authorities, challenging the order passed by the single bench allowing the lamp to be lit at Deepathoon.Justice Swaminathan had Monday allowed Rama Ravikumar and other petitioners to light the lamp at Deepathoon, brushing aside objections on proximity of the site to a dargah and the fact that the lamp has been lit at Uchi Pillaiyar Temple for decades.","State govt files an SLP in the Supreme Court challenging the division bench order, which dismissed its appeal against a single bench order on a contempt plea.

Rajnath Singh Claims Nehru Wanted Babri Built With Public Funds But Sardar Patel Blocked His Plan

KOLKATA/BEHRAMPORE: Calcutta HC directed the Bengal govt Friday to do whatever it takes to pre-empt communal disturbance in Murshidabad’s Beldanga ahead of suspended TMC MLA Humayun Kabir ’s planned foundation-laying ceremony for a “Babri Masjid”, coinciding with the Dec 6 anniversary of the Ayodhya structure’s 1992 demolition.“The state must act per its stand... The law-and-order situation in Murshidabad shall be strictly maintained, and the lives and properties of citizens will be protected,” the division bench of acting Chief Justice Sujoy Paul and Justice Partha Sarathi Sen said while disposing of a PIL against the scheduled event.Kabir’s mosque plan comes barely eight months after communal violence in Murshidabad, triggered by protests against the Wakf (Amendment) Act, 2025.Advocate-general Kishore Datta told the bench the state had already deployed adequate forces to thwart any plan to disturb peace. Deputy solicitor-general Rajdeep Majumdar said 19 companies of CISF were stationed in the area. A 3,500-strong security contingent, including RAF units, fanned out into Rejinagar and its surrounding areas on the eve of the event. Two BSF companies are on standby to secure NH-12.MLA Kabir, suspended by TMC a day ago, was summoned to Rejinagar police station Friday evening and questioned for several hours, sources said.Earlier in the day, a defiant Kabir supervised arrangements for Saturday’s event and asked his team to arrange 30,000 packets of biryani for his guests. He met splinter groups of Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind and All Bengal Imam Muezzin Association.“The main programme will start at noon. The Quran will be read for two hours. There will be no speeches, no political representation, no party flags, and no political canards. I will be there with 2,000 volunteers. Everyone knows... this isn’t a new thing,” he told reporters.TMC spokesman Kunal Ghosh alleged a conspiracy hatched by TMC’s main rival to discredit the party as the state heads into an election year.(With inputs from PTI)",Calcutta HC directs Bengal govt to do whatever it takes to pre-empt communal disturbance in Murshidabad.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday asked the Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and governor Rajendra Arlekarto sort out their differences and finalise the names for the posts of vice-chancellor of two state universities by consensus and made it clear that the court would have to intervene otherwise and appoint them out of the names suggested by the Supreme Court-appointed committee.A bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and P B Varale was hearing the matter related to the appointments of vice-chancellors of the APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University and the University of Digital Sciences Innovation and Technology.Deferring the hearing for the next week, the bench said, “You all have to reach some consensus.
