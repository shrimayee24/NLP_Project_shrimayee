PDP legislator Waheed Rehman Parra had said in the Assembly that after the abrogation of Article 370, media was the biggest casualty in Kashmir, and that the Kashmir Press Club needed to be restored to journalists.

NEW DELHI: Waqf (Amendment) Bill is expected to be introduced in Lok Sabha next week, inviting another round of confrontation between govt and opposition as both are firm on their stands as majority of opposition parties have opposed the legislation.Cabinet has approved the proposed amendments to the Waqf (Amendment) Bill incorporating the changes recently recommended by the parliamentary panel , paving the way for it to be tabled for discussion and passage.The bill was referred to JPC in Aug 2024 after it was introduced in Lok Sabha by minority affairs minister Kiren Rijiju . The parliamentary panel adopted the report with majority vote while all 11 MPs from opposition parties in the panel had objected to the report. They had also moved dissent notes. The 655-page report was submitted to both Houses of Parliament earlier this month. The panel, while doing away with the “Waqf by User” provision, going forward, has allowed only existing “Registered Waqf by User” to be recognised as waqf. This will exclude the cases where the properties are under dispute or owned by govt. As per the report, the panel had supported inclusion of non-Muslims in waqf boards, which can go upto four and recommended transfer of dispute investigation authority from district collectors to senior state govt appointees.The state waqf boards will now include one member from the Muslim OBC community, ensuring broader representation. NDA, led by BJP is safely placed in Lok Sabha as a simple majority requires 272 votes to pass any legislation. NDA has 293 of 543 seats. In Jan, JPC approved 14 amendments proposed by NDA members, with TDP and JDU backing the revised version, signaling their alignment with BJP’s agenda. The proposed amendments introduce a series of changes designed to modernise the Waqf system. Among the key provisions are stricter regulations governing the registration and monitoring of Waqf properties.",Cabinet has approved the proposed amendments to the Waqf (Amendment) Bill.

Woman who accused Maharashtra minister Jaykumar Gore of harassment held for extortion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/woman-who-accused-maharashtra-minister-jaykumar-gore-of-harassment-held-for-extortion/articleshow/119322238.cms,"KOLHAPUR: A Satara-based woman who had accused Maharashtra minister Jaykumar Gore of harassment was arrested while accepting Rs 1 crore as the first tranche of the Rs 3 crore she had allegedly demanded to settle the matter, police said on Friday.Gore, who is state rural development and panchayati raj minister, had claimed that the woman had demanded the extortion money through a Wai resident, Viraj Ratansinha Shinde, to not sit in protest at Raj Bhavan, a police officer said.The woman had allegedly told Shinde that if the money was not paid, she would also accuse the minister of raping her and lead a campaign seeking his resignation, the officer said.""Shinde approached us with the complaint that the woman was blackmailing the minister. With the help of two witnesses, the complainant arranged Rs 1 crore (arranged in 10 wads of Rs 10 lakh each). She told the complainant to come to her lawyer's officer, where we arrested her while she was accepting the money. A case has been registered with Satara city police station under BNS Sections 61 (2) [criminal conspiracy], 308 (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) [related to extortion], 351(3) [criminal conspiracy], and 3(5) [common intention]. She will be produced before a court in Satara on Saturday. We have ample evidence to seek police custody,"" said inspector Arun Devkar of the local crime branch in Satara.Though TOI tried to contact Gore for comment, his phone was switched off till late evening and text messages remained unanswered.In 2016, the woman had accused Gore of sexual harassment, assault, stalking, and transmitting material containing sexually explicit acts. Recently, in an interview on an online video-sharing platform, she alleged that Gore was maligning her image and that she was coming on record in public about the 2016 case. Gore denied the charges, stating that he had fought a legal battle and the court had acquitted him. On March 10 this year, Satara police arrested journalist Tushar Kharat after Gore alleged that he had sought Rs 5 crore to stop the smear campaign. After his police custody ended, Kharat was remanded in judicial custody till March 26 by a Vaduj court.The woman's allegations triggered an uproar in the ongoing assembly session, with the opposition demanding his resignation. The minister, however, brought a breach of privilege motion against NCP(SP) MLA Rohit Pawar and Kharat.Following the woman's arrest, opposition questioned the circumstances leading to the payment of Rs 1 crore and the source of the cash.Rohit Pawar said: ""What did the woman possess that Gore agreed to pay her Rs 1 crore? There was an agreement between the woman and Gore that if the latter stopped harassing her, she would let him free. What was the reason for agreement?""NCP (SP) MP Supriya Sule said: ""After demonetisation, how can a person have Rs 1 crore in cash? It was a double-engine govt that brought in demonetisation. The question arises whether the woman had sought the money or it was deliberately handed to her. Central agencies, such as ED and CBI, should investigate the source of Rs 1 crore cash.""Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut said, ""The journalist and the woman were arrested in the same way. It is sheer misuse of power."" BJP MLA Parinay Phuke, however, said it was an opposition conspiracy to defame the minister and force him to resign.","Satara-based woman had accused Maharashtra minister Jaykumar Gore of harassment.

NEW DELHI: Boxing Federation of India’s (BFI) elections are heading towards an intriguing finish.Incumbent Ajay Singh and the opposing faction challenging his presidential candidacy are exercising every conceivable strategy to outmanoeuvre each other in this high-stakes electoral contest.After the initial triumph of having rejected former sports minister Anurag Thakur ’s bid to contest the federation’s elections following an unexpected office directive and suspending secretary general Hemanta Kalita and treasurer Digvijay Singh on allegations of corruption and favouritism, Singh-led BFI has been compelled to confront successive setbacks within a span of two days through various court orders, yielding the advantage to their opponents.On March 7, the Delhi high court had stayed the federation’s directive that only bonafide and duly-elected members of BFI’s affiliated units are authorised to represent their respective states in the forthcoming elections, scheduled for March 28 in Gurugram. The court had ruled on a petition filed by the Delhi Amateur Boxing Association (DABA), paving the way for its office bearers Rohit Jainendra Jain and Neeraj Kant Bhatt to vote in the BFI’s annual general meeting (AGM) as Delhi boxing body’s representatives.On Thursday, another ruling by the Himachal Pradesh high court allowed Thakur to contest the BFI’s presidential election by staying his disqualification from the electoral college based on the March 7 circular and directed Returning Officer – former Delhi high court judge R K Gauba – to include the senior BJP leader and four-time Lok Sabha MP’s name as one of the representatives from the Himachal boxing body to enable his candidature.A single judge bench of Justice Ajay Mohan Goel directed the BFI to extend the last date of submission of nominations so that Thakur can file his papers whilst permitting him to represent the Himachal Pradesh Boxing Association (HPBA) in the AGM and “fully participate therein”.Justice Goel ruled that the electoral college approved by the RO on March 12 and 13, which left out Thakur, “is prima facie bad and not sustainable in law”“In this backdrop, balance of convenience is also in favour of the petitioners and if interim, as prayed for by the petitioners is not granted, then irreparable loss shall be caused to them. As an ad-interim measure, this court stayed the operation of notice, dated 07.03.2025, as well as the rejection of nomination of one of the two nominated members namely, Mr. Anurag Singh Thakur. It also goes without saying that the election process will be subject to the final outcome of this writ petition or any other order that may be passed by the court in this application,” the order stated.The court ruled that prima facie, it was evident that the March 7 order by Singh was issued “without any authority and without any power”.Thakur was declared ineligible on the grounds that he wasn’t an elected member of the HPBA and can’t represent the state in the BFI’s AGM. The HPBA maintained that Thakur was an elected member of the state unit since 2008 and served “in different capacities, including chairman”.HPBA’s president Rajesh Bhandari will be another representative from the state, along with Thakur.Reacting to the development, a BFI source close to president Singh’s camp said that the next course of action will be decided after going through the 34-page order. “A lot will now depend on the RO. We have received both the court orders and the BFI’s legal team will go through them. We will certainly challenge them in the respective courts,” added the source.",Boxing Federation of India’s (BFI) elections are heading towards an intriguing finish.
