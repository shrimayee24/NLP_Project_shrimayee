crosses its ‘threshold votes’, it gains disproportionately, and if its votes fall below this threshold, its seats fall dramatically.Since analysis of a party’s electoral performance is more focused on seats, people tend to ignore the fact that a party might not be winning seats but still remains a force on the ground. Other factors like elections From the time of Jan Sangh — 1951 to 1971 — to BJP’s ﬁrst election in 1984, the party had a low conversion ratio of votes into seats. Its vote share was always higher than its seat share. In 1984, it got 7.4% of the votes and 0.4% of the seats. From the next election onwards, when it crossed 11% of votes — which might be near the party’s seat conversion threshold — it saw a dramatic increase in seats.From 1989 onwards its seat share was always higher than vote share. Between 1984 and 2014, the party peaked in 1998-99, when it got around 24-26% of the votes and 34% of the seats. The next dramatic jump came in 2014. From 18.8% in 2009, vote share increased by 12.5 percentage points to reach 31.3%. Share in seats, however, improved by more than 30 percentage points — from 21.4% in 2009 to 51.9% in 2014.Congress, on the other hand, went on a different trajectory. In 2009, the party had got 28.6% of the votes and won 37.9% of the seats. In the next election, its vote share declined by 9 percentage points while seats came down by almost 30 percentage points. Despite getting around 20% votes in 2014 and 2019 – which seems to be lower than the party’s threshold – the party got less than 10% of the seats, indicating that seats alone are no benchmark to understand its ground presence.Between 2004 and 2009, the Left’s vote share increased by 0.4% while seats increased by 3.1%, indicating that for that election the party’s threshold was between 7% and 8% of votes. In the next election, the party saw a 0.6 percentage point dip in its vote share but the seat share came down by 6.4 percentage points.Trinamool Congress’ vote and seat shares show an interesting trend. Between 2004 and 2009, its vote share increased by 1.1 percentage points while seat share saw a 3.1 percentage point rise.For these elections, which were multi-cornered between the Left, Trinamool and Congress, the party’s threshold might be around 3% votes, and hence a small jump in votes gave a disproportionate gain in seats. Elections in West Bengal kept on becoming two-cornered, which might have pushed the threshold vote share. Between 2014 and 2019, when the election was between BJP and Trinamool, the party’s vote share increased by 0.4 percentage points while its seats dropped by 2.2 percentage points.Similarly,as the contest became more bipolar.Samajwadi Party saw a slight increase in its vote share butbecause of a similar reason.BSP, on the other hand, has a slightly different story.In 2019, its vote share declined but seat share increased. This happened because it contested fewer seats as it had allied with SP.For many parties like DMK and ADMK, the dedicated voters remain loyal as their vote share remains constant but seats might change dramatically. This could be because fence-sitting voters with no committed loyalty to DMK or ADMK switch votes in different elections. For instance, in the 2004, 2009 and 2014 LS elections, DMK’s vote share remained constant at 1.8% while its seats changed from 16 to 18 to 0 in the three elections.In 2019, its vote share increased by 0.6 percentage points while its seats increased by 4.4 percentage points. Similarly for ADMK, between 2009 and 2014, the vote share increased by 1.6 percentage points while the corresponding increase in seat share was more than 5 percentage points.","The first-past-the-post system of voting can often lead to counterintuitive outcomes.

NEW DELHI: Replying to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's allegations that the Congress has received money from businessmen Adani and Ambani , Congress leader Rahul Gandhi challenged the PM to initiate a CBI or ED investigation into the matter.Gandhi questioned whether PM Modi's comments about money being sent by businessmen in a tempo were based on his ""personal experience"".""The money that PM Modi has given to the two businessmen, the Congress party will give the same amount of money to the people of India through the various schemes that the party has promised,"" Gandhi said.""The country knows who is the driver and helper of the BJP's tempo of corruption,"" he said in a post in Hindi on X.""Modi ji, are you a little scared?

Is it your personal experience?"" Gandhi said.""Do one thing - send the CBI, ED to them and carry out a thorough investigation and don't be scared,"" he said.Earlier, at an election rally in Telangana, PM Modi accused the Congress of having a ""deal"" with ""Ambani and Adani"" and questioned if the party had received ""tempo loads of black money"" from the businessmen in exchange for Rahul Gandhi's silence on the issue.PM Modi pointed out that the Congress had been criticizing Adani and Ambani for five years but suddenly stopped after the announcement of elections, suggesting that something suspicious had occurred.""Certainly something is fishy.

Sam Pitroda quits Congress post after row over his racial remarks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sam-pitroda-quits-congress-post-after-row-over-his-racial-remarks/articleshow/109954643.cms,"Racist remark: PM Modi tears into 'Shehzade's Philosopher' Sam Pitroda

NEW DELHI: Sam Pitroda on Wednesday quit as the chairman of the Indian Overseas Congress after a massive row over his racist remarks. Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge has accepted his resignation .""Sam Pitroda has decided to step down as Chairman of the Indian Overseas Congress of his own accord. The Congress President has accepted his decision,"" Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said on X.Earlier in the day, Pitroda landed in controversy as he compared Indians from different parts of the nation to Chinese, Arabs, Whites and Africans while talking about diversity and democracy in India during an interview.""We are a shining example of democracy in the world...we could hold country together as diverse as India where people in East look like Chinese, people in West look like Arab, people in North look like maybe white and people in South look like Africa. Doesn't matter, we are all brothers and sisters,"" said the chairman of the Indian Overseas Congress.Soon after the clip of the remark went viral on social media, Prime Minister Narendra Modi lashed out at Sam Pitroda during his Telangana rally. ""I am very angry today... I am very angry with the remark made by Sam Pitroda"". The PM added, ""We will not accept this racist mentality"". PM also linked Pitroda's statement to Congress's decision of fielding a candidate against Droupadi Murmu for the presidential election in 2022.Pitroda has made controversial remarks in the past as well garnering the anger of opposition and the public.In the midst of awaiting the inauguration of the Ram Mandir in June 2023, Sam Pitroda claimed that the construction of temples would not provide solutions to the critical challenges faced by India, specifically highlighting the urgent matters of joblessness, rising prices, educational concerns, and healthcare issues.Sam Pitroda sparked another debate when he discussed the concept of inheritance tax in the United States. He explained, ""In America, there is an inheritance tax. If one has 100 million USD worth of wealth and when he dies he can only transfer 45 per cent to his children, 55 per cent is grabbed by the government. That's an interesting law. It says you in your generation, made wealth and you are leaving now, you must leave your wealth for the public, not all of it, half of it, which to me sounds fair."" His comments stirred up controversy as he only gave the example of the United States. Pitroda's remark led to the BJP and PM Modi attacking Congress on the issue of ""wealth redistribution"".Another incident involving Pitroda was in wake of the Pulwama attack in February 2019, as he said, “I don’t know much about attacks. It happens all the time. Attack happened in Mumbai, also. We could have then reacted and just sent our planes, but that is not the right approach. According to me, that’s not how you deal with the world,"" Pitroda had said.In response to a question about former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's alleged role in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, Pitroda sparked yet another controversy in May 2019 with his dismissive remark, ""so what."" His statement quickly ignited a firestorm of outrage. Pitroda said: ""Ab kya hai '84 ka? Aapne kya kiya 5 saal mein, uski baat kariye.""Sam Pitroda had also faced backlash from the BJP in early 2024 after he shared an article authored by Sudheendra Kulkarni, a former close aide to prominent BJP leader LK Advani. The article in question argued that India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, played a more significant role in the creation of the Indian Constitution than BR Ambedkar. Pitroda's support prompted the BJP to criticise Congress, accusing it of being 'anti-Dalit'.","Sam Pitroda quit as chairman of the Indian Overseas Congress on Wednesday.

Normally, you speak of Adani-Ambani in closed rooms. For the first time, you have taken their names in public. You even know that they send money in tempos, is that your personal experience? Send CBI-ED to them, get an inquiry done as soon as possible,” Rahul said in the message, hours after Modi made the surprise attack.Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge joined in the counter-attack and said the PM had turned on his friends because of his fear of imminent defeat in elections.“Since April 3, Rahul Gandhi has mentioned Adani 103 times and Ambani more than 30 times in his speeches,” Congress general secretary in-charge of communications Jairam Ramesh said. He added that Congress had repeatedly demanded the formation of a joint parliamentary committee to investigate the “Modani scam” since Jan last year.Rushing to her brother’s defence, Priyanka Gandhi said, “The PM might be saying that Rahul does not take the name of Adani and Ambani, but the fact is that he (Rahul) does so every day. On the contrary, I feel the PM is giving a lot of clarifications these days. After all, he has given the nation’s wealth to billionaires. Airports, ports, roads or mines, you name it, and it is gone.”Kharge said Modi’s attack on his “own friends” was the best opinion poll on the first three phases of elections. “Time is changing... A friend is no more a friend. After completion of three phases of elections, the PM has started attacking his own friends,” he said.Congress general secretary (organisation) K C Venugopal called the PM’s statement “laughable” and one that further “confirms his desperation after the drubbing in phase three”.

Although the BJP govt technically appears safe for now, three Independents withdrawing support could affect the party's prospects in the Lok Sabha poll. The state will vote in the fifth phase on May 25, with BJP facing the challenge of retaining all 10 seats it won in 2019.Dushyant, JJP's national senior vice-president, told reporters at his residence in Hisar that the party would write to the governor to ask the BJP govt to take a floor test to prove its majority. The rulebook stipulates that a no-confidence motion can't be moved against any govt within six months of the previous one, which in Haryana's case was in Feb.But Dushyant said CM Saini should either prove his majority in the assembly or immediately resign.The three Independents who withdrew support to the govt — Sombir Sangwan (Dadri), Randhir Singh Gollen (Pundri) and Dharampal Gonder (Nilokheri) — said at a presser on Tuesday that they would back Congress , which has 30 MLAs in the House.Dushyant said JJP MLAs violating the party's whip risk facing the same treatment some rebel Congress legislators in Himachal Pradesh some time ago for turning against their party in the Rajya Sabha election.He said JJP had already issued notices to three MLAs for sharing the stage with rival parties. One of them could be JJP's Narwana MLA Ramniwas Surjakhera, who backed BJP's Sirsa candidate Ashok Tanwar at the saffron party's rally in his constituency on Wednesday. CM Saini led the campaign.The JJP MLA previously attended a rally by former CM Khattar, who is BJP's nominee for the Karnal seat.Khattar downplayed the withdrawal of support by three Independent MLAs, saying at roadshows in Nilokheri and Indri that such things were par for the course in politics.“It's election time, someone will join the party while someone will quit.

Let him declare how much money has been taken from Ambani-Adani…how many sacks of black money? Have tempos full of currency notes reached Cong? What deal has been struck? PM Modi

HYDERABAD/NEW DELHI: In a curious twist to the electoral discourse on crony capitalism , PM Modi on Wednesday accused Congress of striking a deal with “Ambani and Adani” and asked if the party had received “tempo loads of black money” from the two businessmen in return for Rahul Gandhi to stop “abusing” them during the elections.“You must have seen, for the past five years, the Congress shehzada used to chant morning to evening...Since his Rafale issue got grounded, he started chanting about ‘five industrialists’... then ‘Ambani-Adani’. But ever since elections have been announced, these people (Congress) have stopped abusing Ambani-Adani,” the PM said at a rally in Karimnagar in Telangana.The PM said, “Mein aaj Telangana ki dharti se poochna chahta hoon… shehzade ghoshit kare ki chunaav mein yeh Ambani-Adani se kitna maal uthaya hai. Kaale dhan ke kitne bore bhar kar ke rupye maare hain? Kya tempo bhar kar ke notein Congress ke liye pahunchi hai kya? Kya sauda hua hai? (I ask from the soil of Telangana, let the shehzada declare how much money he has taken from Ambani-Adani these elections… how many sacks of black money? Have tempos full of currency notes reached Congress? What deal has been struck?)”PM Modi said there was certainly something fishy (“daal me kuch kaala hai”) as for five years, they (Congress and Rahul) abused Adani-Ambani and it stopped overnight. “It means you have received some tempo loads of ‘chori ka maal’ (looted money),” he added.The PM accusing Congress of taking huge amounts of black money came as a surprise since he has been at the receiving end of the opposition party’s barbs on crony capitalism.While Congress rejected the charge by saying Rahul has consistently attacked Ambani and Adani, there were indications that BJP may not close the fresh front it has opened. Sources in BJP said unlike in the past, the campaign has seen Adani-Ambani ceasing to be Congress's main line of attack. “In any case, isn’t Ambani now missing from their concocted narrative of crony capitalism?” a source asked.Modi’s speech focused on alleged corruption in Telangana under the Revanth Reddy-led Congress govt with the PM suggesting that one part of the bribes earned by one “R” in Hyderabad was getting transferred to another “R” in New Delhi. Mentioning the Telugu blockbuster ‘RRR’, Modi said there was a discussion on an “RR Tax” in Telangana. “Even a child in Telangana knows about the double R tax... You all know about the RRR film but I was told that the RR have left behind the RRR film in collections. As you know, RRR earned more than Rs 1,000 crore but I was told that this much was collected by RR just in a few days, such a loot they have organised,” he said.Although the PM did not take any names, his mention of “RR” was seen as a reference to Rahul and Revanth Reddy. He said wherever Congress formed govt, its “ATM of money collection” started as he also mentioned unaccounted cash collected from the staff of a Jharkhand minister.Modi said Congress’s fuse was blown after the third phase of polling and that the INDIA bloc would need a microscope to find its winning seats after the fourth phase. “Congress was already, in any case, having to use magnifying glass to spot seats they could win. Now after three rounds of polling, they realise that they have to use a new, more powerful magnifying glass to identify the few they can still win,” he said.“Wherever there is Congress, there will be plenty of lies and fraud,” Modi said. “It is an anti-SC/ST/OBC party. One of the prominent faces of the Congress alliance has stated that all reservations must be given to Muslims. This despite Ambedkar making it clear that no religious reservations can be given. They have no respect for the Constitution. These people do not want SC, ST and OBC to come up and take away their seats,” he added.","PM Modi accused Congress of striking a deal with “Ambani and Adani’ and asked if the party had received “tempo loads of black money” from the two businessmen. “It means you have received some tempo loads of ‘chori ka maal’ (looted money),” he added.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109958955,imgsize-1114414,width-400,resizemode-4/109958955.jpg"

They neither understand India nor its heritage,"" Ravi Shankar Prasad told news agency ANI.Calling Pitrodia ""Shakuni"" of the Congress party, former Congress leader and BJP spokesperson CR Kesavan slammed his comment as ""vile and racist"".He said the senior Congress leader's remark ""exposes very clearly the bigoted & divisive mindset of the Congress leadership"".""Vile and racist statement by the Shakuni of the Congress party, Sam Pitroda has demeaned and insulted every one of our 140 crore Indians today. This also exposes very clearly the bigoted & divisive mindset of the Congress leadership...What kind of a perverse and parochial mindset is this?...It reflects the diseased and divisive mindset of the Congress party,"" Kesavan said.""Congress party owes an explanation...First, they need to take action & expel Sam Pitroda from the Congress party...Rahul Gandhi, on behalf of Congress party, should come before the nation and seek an unconditional apology for this racist, bigoted mindset of Congress party,"" he further added.The Congress has dissociated itself from the Pitroda's analogies, calling them ""mostunfortunate and unacceptable"".""The analogies drawn by Mr Sam Pitroda in a podcast to illustrate India's diversity are most unfortunate and unacceptable. The Indian National Congress completely dissociates itself from these analogies,"" Jiram Ramesh, Congress's general secretary in-charge communications, posted on X.This is not the first time the Congress leader has triggered a political firestorm with his remarks.Pitroda had earlier expressed his support for the idea of an inheritance tax, drawing inspiration from the American system.He explained that in the United States, when a wealthy individual passes away, only a portion of their assets can be transferred to their children, while the government claims a significant share. Pitroda suggested that adopting a similar approach in India would be fair and beneficial for the public.Pitroda's ""inheritance tax"" remark led to the BJP and PM Modi attacking Congress on the issue of ""wealth redistribution"".Prime Minister Narendra Modi seized on his statement to step up a blistering attack on the ""wealth redistribution"" issue, saying """" is the opposition party's mantra to ""loot"" people.Later, the Congress party clarified its stance saying that sensationalising these remarks was an attempt at diverting attention from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ""malicious"" poll campaign.Pitroda also clarified that he had only mentioned the US inheritance tax as an example during a normal conversation on TV. He emphasised that his comments had nothing to do with the policy of any party, including the Congress.","Congress disassociates itself from Pitroda's remark.

"In Kuppam heat, Naidu locked in revival battle",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-kuppam-heat-naidu-locked-in-revival-battle/articleshow/109963025.cms,"KUPPAM: At 74, TDP national president Nara Chandrababu Naidu is pulling out all the stops to reclaim the position of chief minister of Andhra Pradesh . However, he faces a tough challenge right in his backyard — Kuppam — where he’s seeking his eighth consecutive term in the 2024 elections.Naidu’s political journey began in 1978 when he contested from Chandragiri on a Congress ticket. He swiftly rose through the ranks, becoming one of the youngest ministers in T Anjaiah’s cabinet in 1980.However, his life took a turn in 1980 when he married Bhuvaneswari, the daughter of legendary actor N T Rama Rao.The emergence of Telugu Desam Party (TDP) in 1982, led by NTR, changed the political landscape of Andhra Pradesh. After facing defeat in 1983, Naidu jumped ship and joined TDP, shifting focus to the Kuppam constituency in Chittoor district, securing his maiden victory here in 1989.Naidu has now been the MLA of Kuppam for 35 years, serving thrice as CM between 1995-2004 and 2014-2019. However, the 2024 elections present a critical challenge for him both at the state level and in his very own constituency.After YSRCP reduced TDP to just 23 seats in the 2019 elections, they set their sights on unseating Naidu in Kuppam. The ruling party’s focus intensified after chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy entrusted minister Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy with the task of ending Naidu’s winning streak. YSRCP introduced the “Why not Kuppam” slogan and fielded MLC KRJ Bharat against Naidu, backed by local support.Bharat, the son of former IAS officer K Chandramouli, emerged as Naidu’s strongest contender, with the direct backing of the CM and minister Ped direddy Ramachandra Reddy.In response, Naidu coined “Bangaru Kuppam” to counter the campaign — ‘Bangaru’, a term of endearment to refer to someone beloved. He appointed MLC Kancherla Srikanth to handle constituency issues and thwart opposition strategies.Breaking from tradition, Naidu personally campaigned in this election, supported by his wife, Nara Bhuvaneswari, who joined him on the campaign trail to secure his 8th consecutive victory in Kuppam.As polling day approaches, both parties are leaving no stone unturned. The YSRCP aims to dethrone Naidu, while Naidu aims to secure a majority of 1 lakh votes, having seen his vote share decline drastically in the 2019 elections.“The people of Kuppam have been my strength and inspiration through my political journey,” Naidu said at a recent campaign rally. “Their trust and support have been unwavering, and I am committed to continuing to serve them with dedication and integrity.”Meanwhile, Bharat ex pressed confidence in connection with the voters. “Kuppam deserves effective representation and real change. I am here to be the voice of the people and address their concerns head-on,” he declared passionately, emphasising his determination to bring about a positive change in the constituency.Amid the campaign fervour, both parties are not only focusing on mobilising supporters but also on reaching out to undecided voters. With door-to-door campaigns, public rallies, and social media blitzes, every effort is being made to sway the voters in their favour.Adding to the drama, Kuppam’s residents express mixed feelings. “We’ve seen Naidu’s long reign, but now it’s time for change,” says a local vendor, capturing the sentiment of many. On the other hand, a retired schoolteacher defends Naidu, stat ing, “He’s brought development to our region. Why fix what’s not broken?”Local businesses are abuzz with discussions about the upcoming election. “This election will decide the fate of our town for the next few years,” says a shop owner, echoing the sentiments of many residents who see the election as a pivotal moment in Kuppam’s history.While the candidates trade barbs and promises, the people of Kuppam are weighing their options carefully. “I’ve always supported Naidu, but this time, I’m not so sure,” says a farmer, reflecting the uncertainty that pervades the electorate.With just days left until the election, as the candidates make their final push and the voters prepare to cast their ballots, one thing is certain — Kuppam is at the centre of attention, and the outcome of this election will reverberate far beyond its borders.","TDP national president Nara Chandrababu Naidu is seeking his eighth consecutive term in the 2024 elections.

Before the CM's arrival, dozens of bulldozers reached the venue and, amid loud music, the machine operators performed stunts as the crowd cheered and 'Jai Shri Ram' slogans reverberated.BJP workers with party flags were seen on the dozer blades as the operators rotated the machines 360 degrees and used brakes and engine thrust to move the shock absorbers of the heavy vehicles up and down to simulate ""brake dance"" steps.However, the stunts did not go down well with BJP's Aliganj MLA Satyapal Singh Rathore. On seeing that the gathering was more interested in the bulldozer dance rather than the speeches delivered from the stage, Rathore first requested the BJP workers and the machine operators to stop their show. But the stunts intensified and the crowd increased, prompting the MLA to reprimand the bulldozer drivers and asked them not to carry on with the stunts as any mishap might happen.After the CM arrived, he said, ""We have invented a unique use of these machines to deal with criminals and anti-nationals....

Pakistan SC suspends Peshawar HC order denying reserved seats to Imran-backed party,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-sc-suspends-peshawar-hc-order-denying-reserved-seats-to-imran-backed-party/articleshow/109898987.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s Supreme Court suspended on Monday a high court verdict that a political party aligned with candidates backed by incarcerated former prime minister Imran Khan was not eligible for reserved seats for women and minorities in the national and provincial legislatures.Since the Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) was barred by the top court from contesting the Feb 8 elections under its traditional electoral symbol of a cricket bat on technical grounds, the party had subsequently struck an alliance with another party, Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), in an attempt to secure reserved seats in parliament.Under Pakistan’s election rules, political parties are allotted reserved seats — (there are 60 for women and 10 for minorities in the National Assembly) — in proportion to the number of parliamentary seats they win in the election. This completes the NA’s total strength of 336 seats.In March, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had ruled that SIC was not eligible for reserved seats and decided to distribute the seats among other parliamentary parties, with the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) becoming major beneficiaries. The verdict was rejected by PTI as unconstitutional and the alliance had filed a plea against the electoral watchdog’s decision in the Peshawar HC, but it rejected the appeal.In response, SIC moved the Supreme Court last month urging it to allot the party the reserved seats in the national and provincial assemblies and set aside the Peshawar HC ruling.Accepting SIC’s appeal for a hearing, the apex court clarified that the Peshawar HC order upholding ECP’s decision was suspended to the extent of the remaining reserved seats distributed among other parties.After losing the extra reserved seats, PM Shehbaz Sharif’s coalition government had lost its two-thirds majority in the National Assembly.","Pakistan’s Supreme Court suspended on Monday a high court verdict that a political party was not eligible for reserved seats for women and minorities.
