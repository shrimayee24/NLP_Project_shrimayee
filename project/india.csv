Mamata Banerjee Takes SIR Battle Against Election Commission To Supreme Court, Openly Challenges BJP

KOLKATA: A new welfare scheme called ‘Banglar Yuba-Sathi’ for Bengal’s unemployed youth and a 50% hike in the payout to ‘Lakshmir Bhandar’ beneficiaries headlined the Mamata Banerjee govt’s last budget — a vote-on-account — before the state goes to polls later this year.Finance minister Chandrima Bhattacharya on Thursday had some cheer for state govt employees too, budgeting for a 4% hike in DA. Govt rechristened its Karmashree scheme as “Mahatma Shree” and hiked the minimum number of workdays from 75 to 100 in what is being seen as a nod to Trinamool Congress ’s opposition to the Centre’s decision to replace MGNREGA.Lakshmir Bhandar, Banerjee’s signature women-focused scheme launched before the 2021 assembly polls, will see monthly payouts increase from Rs 1,000 to Rs 1,500. Bhattacharya also announced a Rs 1,000 increase in the monthly honorarium for ASHA and anganwadi workers, para-teachers and civic volunteers. Banerjee said the number of social welfare schemes had crossed a landmark. “We had 94 schemes. We just hit a century with the new ones. ”Economist and BJP MLA Ashok Lahiri termed the vote-on-account “more like the Trinamool manifesto” than a budget, saying it doesn’t account for additional funding required to pay higher DA to govt employees.",New welfare scheme called ‘Banglar Yuba-Sathi’ for Bengal’s unemployed youth. 50% hike in the payout to ‘Lakshmir Bhandar’ beneficiaries.

'Arrogant, Liar': Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee Attacks CEC Gyanesh After SIR Meet In Delhi

KOLKATA: Bucking the trend set by governors of Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka, West Bengal governor CV Ananda Bose avoided a confrontation with the elected govt over his inaugural address of the budget session of assembly. Although he delivered a truncated four-and-half-minute speech, he scaled down the pitch that had previously put the state govt and Raj Bhavan at loggerheads over multiple issues.Bose read out portions of the address highlighting law and order, including references to Kolkata being among the safest cities in the country. In a rare display of cordiality, he was even seen briefly holding hands and speaking with CM Mamata Banerjee after his address, prompting BJP legislators to sarcastically comment “well done”, as he exited the House.During a heated discussion that followed the governor’s address, there were fiery exchanges between the CM and leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari. Hitting out at BJP, Banerjee said: “We will win in court and we will win the vote as well. Don’t even imagine winning Bengal. You are already in trouble in Delhi. Everyone can see the condition of the so-called double-engine govt. You were zero, you are zero and you will remain zero.Stay well, stay healthy, but remember you will lose many seats.”Her remarks came amid repeated interruptions and counter-allegations from Adhikari, who said Bose deliberately curtailed his address to avoid reading out sections critical of the Union govt. The leader of opposition claimed the governor read the speech for barely 4.5 minutes and stopped before reaching references such as ‘Ghatal Master Plan’.Responding to the charge, Banerjee said it was part of the legislative convention for the governor to read the opening portions of the address and formally lay the document in the House. Looking directly at Adhikari, she added: “People will point at you and say — you don’t know anything at all. Just keep watching; many will lose their seats this time.”The governors of the three opposition-governed southern states had earlier stoked a controversy by refusing to stick to the speech documents provided by respective state govts and even walking out of the House before completing their address.Meanwhile, the assembly saw sharp political sparring over a proposed discussion on SIR of electoral rolls after speaker Biman Banerjee ruled out a debate on the issue, noting that the matter was pending before SC. TMC had sought a discussion on SIR, arguing it had caused widespread harassment of voters ahead of the 2026 assembly polls.","West Bengal governor CV Ananda Bose avoided a confrontation with the elected govt over his inaugural address of the budget session of assembly.

'Justice Is Crying...': Mamata Banerjee Takes EC Head On In Supreme Court Over SIR Row In Bengal





KOLKATA: Snapping its decade-old alliance ties with the Left Front, Congress on Thursday decided to ""go it alone"" in the 2026 Bengal assembly polls and fight in all 294 seats, setting the stage for a four-cornered contest.Putting to rest speculation over a seat-sharing arrangement with the Left Front and its smaller allies, AICC general secretary and Congress's Bengal in-charge Ghulam Ahmad Mir said: ""We decided to walk alone and it was a collective decision of the leadership. We will contest in all 294 seats. We entered into an alliance with the Left Front earlier but that did not boost the morale of party workers at the ground level. ""Pradesh Congress functionaries, while maintaining that the party had gained considerable strength in around 60 seats, left the decision to Adhir Chowdhury on whether to contest.The meeting took place at the official residence of Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge at 10, Rajaji Marg, New Delhi. During the session, the majority of netas advocated for Congress to contest the elections alone. Some state netas were also contacted over virtual meeting platforms.""Electors in Bengal and workers in the state have the aspiration of fighting alone this time,"" Mir said.This meeting with the party high command over a possible seat-sharing was delayed twice before.Kharge and Congress neta Rahul Gandhi met Bengal functionaries, including the party's Bengal president, Subhankar Sarkar, Adhir Chowdhury and Malda South MP Isha Khan Chowdhury.Pradesh Congress was already divided into two camps over seat-sharing with the Left Front. While the Murshidabad unit, led by former PCC president Adhir, was in favour of an alliance, the Malda unit spoke against any probable seat-sharing formula.In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, Congress secured leads in 13 seats, mostly in Malda and Murshidabad. It progressed in terms of vote tally despite inconsistencies over the alliance.At the meeting, Adhir highlighted the necessity of an alliance with the Left. He pointed out that by forming an alliance with the Left in 2016, Congress had become the main opposition party in the West Bengal Legislative Assembly. Although both the Left Front and Congress were reduced to 0 seats in the polarised 2021 elections, Congress managed to win the Sagardighi by-election with support of the Left.Pradesh Congress president Sarkar, who was in favour of assessing the party's strength alone, said;, ""The youth were in favour of fighting alone this time. The high command kept their opinion in mind before coming to the decision.""The Congress high command, a source said, also took the equation between the CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front and the Congress-led United Democratic Front in Kerala into consideration.","Congress decides to ""go it alone"" in the 2026 Bengal assembly polls and fight in all 294 seats.
