"With Eye On Muslim Votes, Owaisi's Party Plans To Contest 10-12 Seats",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/with-eye-on-muslim-votes-owaisis-party-plans-to-contest-10-12-seats/articleshow/117037743.cms,"HYDERABAD/NEW DELHI: The All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen ( AIMIM ) is planning to contest 10-12 seats in the upcoming Delhi elections . So far, it has announced only two candidates - Tahir Hussain from Mustafabad and Shafur Rehman, who is the Jamia Alumni Association (AAJMI) president, from Okhla.AIMIM's Delhi unit, in consultation with party president and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi , is likely to announce the remaining candidates in the next couple of days.Sources in AIMIM told TOI the Delhi unit is keen to contest from Babarpur, Ballimaran, Chandni Chowk, Okhla, Jangpura, Sadar Bazar, Matia Mahal, Karwan Nagar and Seelampur. Most of these constituencies have a large population of Muslims. Except Karwan Nagar, which was won by BJP in 2020, the others have been electing an AAP candidate for the last two terms.If AIMIM fields a candidate in Jangpura, the person would be up against AAP's former deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia. BJP has fielded Tarvinder Singh Marwah while Congress has given a ticket to former councillor Farhad Suri.AIMIM's Delhi head Shoaib Jamai said the party has the scope to become a kingmaker, adding it will support any party that defeats BJP and can beat it in the future too.On fielding Delhi riots accused Tahir Hussain from Mustafabad, Jamai said everyone has the right to contest elections in a democracy. ""Other parties too are fielding candidates who went to jail. Ultimately, it is the people who decide who should represent them. We are trying to give voice to those suppressed,"" he added.Hussain was linked to the 2020 Delhi riots, with the police naming him as a key accused. AAP parted ways with him after he was charged. Recently, he got a reprieve in a related case after Delhi High Court quashed an FIR against him.AIMIM had contested the municipal polls from a few wards in northeast Delhi and Muslim-dominated constituencies. Owaisi had campaigned in the national capital, but the party drew a blank.The smaller parties have largely not been able to pose any major challenges to AAP and BJP in the assembly polls, which have been a bipolar contest. The third player in the ring, Congress, has seen its vote percentage erode in recent times, shrinking to 4% in the last assembly elections.","The All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen is planning to contest 10-12 seats in the upcoming Delhi elections.

Arvind Kejriwal with his freebies is AAP's best guarantee,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/arvind-kejriwal-with-his-freebies-is-aaps-best-guarantee/articleshow/117037671.cms,"NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party, which is the only party to have announced candidates for all 70 seats for the Feb 5 assembly elections in Delhi, has undergone significant transformation in its character and approach since the last polls in 2020. The party, which once talked about Congress and BJP as being chips off the same block and enmeshed in corruption, now prioritises electoral win in selecting candidates and has nominated eight individuals who were earlier members of BJP and Congress.Some long-standing members who were associated with the party since the Anna Hazare era have departed, among them Rajya Sabha member Swati Maliwal and minister Kailash Gahlot. Maliwal left after accusing Arvind Kejriwal's aide Vibhav Kumar of physically assaulting her, while Gahlot charged the party with deviating from its founding principles. The two Dalit ministers, Raaj Kumar Anand and Rajinder Pal Gautam, quit the party claiming AAP wasn't attentive to scheduled castes.Following corruption allegations against senior functionaries, AAP was beset with internal challenges until Kejriwal was released on bail from jail in Sept last year. His presence helped reunite the party and present a cohesive front to the public. Its electoral strategy continues to centre on Kejriwal's leadership, emphasising his ""ability"" to fulfil promises. The party has announced direct transfer of Rs 2,100 to women, garnering positive support among the public. To counter criticism about the funds required for such an outlay, Kejriwal described himself as a ""magician of finances"", asserting that ""only"" he knew how to save money to fund such programmes.Since the 2020 polls, AAP's leadership has undergone substantial changes, partly forced by desertions and partly by imperatives after the jailing of Kejriwal and deputy CM Manish Sisodia on corruption charges. Atishi, Saurabh Bharadwaj and Durgesh Pathak rose to prominence as key party representatives, assuming duties formerly managed by Sisodia and incarcerated minister Satyendar Jain.The party has also focused on building an organisation structure with Rajya Sabha member Sandeep Pathak taking on the main responsibility. Pathak, an MP from Punjab, played a pivotal role in the party's victory in Punjab in 2022 and now focuses on grassroots mobilisation. Vijay Nayyar, who was arrested in the excise policy case, also acts as the backroom boy on formulating AAP's election strategy.For AAP, winning Delhi again is about vindicating it's stand that its functionaries were framed by BJP in a cynical turf war. Kejriwal, when resigning as CM, declared that the people's court would decide the corruption allegations. An AAP functionary said, ""The people of Delhi know that our leaders were wrongly framed after BJP realised it couldn't defeat us democratically. We have made Delhiites' lives easier. No other state gives so much to people in the form of free services.""AAP has had three significant turnouts in assembly elections. It's first ever foray as a political party in 2013 got it 28 of Delhi 70 assembly seats. It formed the govt with Congress support that lasted 49 days. In 2015, it got a landslide victory, triumphing in 67 seats. It maintained its dominance in 2020 by grabbing 62 seats. However, AAP's performance in the Lok Sabha polls has been notably poor and it failed to secure any of the seven parliamentary seats in the last three general elections. The Lok Sabha voting in terms of assembly seats shows that AAP led in only five seats in 2019, the rest going to BJP. In 2024, BJP had leads in 52 constituencies, while AAP had the upper hand in 10 and Congress in eight.","Aam Aadmi Party is the only party to have announced candidates for all 70 seats for the Feb 5 assembly elections in Delhi.

BJP makes graft slur against AAP campaign's pivot,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-makes-graft-slur-against-aap-campaigns-pivot/articleshow/117037670.cms,"NEW DELHI: Out of power in Delhi for more than 25 years, BJP has focused its campaign on allegations of corruption against AAP functionaries and renovation of the chief minister's residence, which they refer to as ""Sheesh Mahal"". The party is yet to spell out its own agenda for governance if it manages to oust AAP.With the AAP govt's promise of a Rs 2,100 direct transfer to women being one of the talking points ahead of the polls, some Delhi functionaries are waiting for the party's nod for their strategy to somewhat blunt the threat from AAP's Mahila Samman Scheme with their own offer of direct transfer benefits to women which it could include in its manifesto.A senior party functionary said BJP is in a good position to convince people with the examples of party-ruled Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.AAP's claim that BJP will put an end to freebies related to 200 units of electricity, bus travel and water if it came to power was countered by PM Narendra Modi himself at the 'Parivartan Rally' in Rohini on Sunday. He gave the assurance that BJP won't end any of the welfare schemes being run by the AAP govt.He also targeted former CM Arvind Kejriwal over the renovation of his residence at Flag Staff Road, giving a clear indication that the issue is critical for BJP's campaign.The party, with its extensive karyakarta network and with the benefit of a decade long anti-incumbency against AAP , aims to maintain its Lok Sabha voting percentage of over fifty percent in the forthcoming election. With a vote share of 54.33 per cent, BJP made a clean sweep of all the seven Lok Sabha seats in Delhi for the third time in a row last year. Its vote share in 2019 was 56.7 per cent.The party has conducted a year-long outreach programme in jhuggis, an AAP stronghold during the previous two Vidhan Sabha elections, to achieve this target. This approach was again evident during the PM's speech where he urged party members at the venue to record photographs and videos of Swabhiman Apartments. He instructed party workers to reach out to those who don't have pucca houses and inform them about similar housing opportunities. The PM's remarks were in reference to the 1,675 newly built flats at Swabhiman Apartments in Ashok Vihar, which were inaugurated on Friday and some handed over to slum-dwellers.The party is also counting on what it perceives as discontent against AAP. ""There is anti-incumbency against both state govt and MCD with the latter failing to keep the city clean or build roads. There is waterlogging everywhere during rain,"" pointed out a BJP functionary.What BJP, however, lacks is a chief ministerial candidate and AAP has targeted the party on the issue. However, BJP considers this approach advantageous, having successfully implemented it in several states, including Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana.While some BJP members believe having a leader matching Kejriwal's popularity could have been beneficial, the absence of a CM face prevents factionalism, which is prevalent in BJP's local unit. The party attributes its poor performance in the 2020 elections partly to naming Kiran Bedi as the CM candidate.Party insiders said that at the core of BJP's strategy is whipping up a wave in the last month. ""This involves several central leaders campaigning in Delhi, wide publicity and taking the corruption allegations against AAP leaders to the residents of Delhi. These efforts will help change people's minds,"" they said.",BJP has focused its campaign on allegations of corruption against AAP functionaries and renovation of the chief minister's residence. The party is yet to spell out its own agenda for governance if it manages to oust AAP.

After all, the party failed to open its account in the Delhi assembly in 2015 and 2020, a decimation that started with it being supplanted by the newbie AAP of Arvind Kejriwal in 2013 as Congress was relegated to eight seats.Delhi has held a political appeal disproportionate to its size and partial statehood, as it was used by Congress in 2003 to project its resilience in the face of BJP's sweep of polls in Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and MP. The 2015 results, that defied the national mood of Narendra Modi's sweep to office, was deployed by Kejriwal to proclaim AAP as the ""new Congress"". The mood held, even if the promise did not.Going by past narrative, Congress is in an unenviable position. It is looking at its negligible muscle in Delhi to beef up the national mood, dampened by its shock defeats in Haryana and Maharashtra just after it had announced ""revival"" following LS 2024.From the national perspective, Congress would hope for a marginal bounce back and enough AAP slide that can lead to an alliance govt of estranged INDIA partners.
