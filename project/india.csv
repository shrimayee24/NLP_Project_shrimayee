PM Modi a ‘shahanshah': Priyanka Gandhi responds to ‘shehzada' jibe for Rahul,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-a-shahanshaah-priyanka-gandhi-responds-to-shehzada-jibe-for-rahul/articleshow/109844698.cms,"NEW DELHI: Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra launched a scathing attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, labeling him 'Shahanshah' (king of kings) during a public rally held in Lakhani, Gujarat's Banaskantha Lok Sabha constituency. Her remarks came in response to PM Modi 's recent jibe at her brother Rahul Gandhi, where he referred to him as ' shehzada ' (prince).Addressing a public rally at Lakhani in Gujarat's Banaskantha Lok Sabha constituency to canvass for her party candidate Geniben Thakor, she also accused PM Modi of using the people of Gujarat for power and then forgetting them.“He calls my brother ‘shehzada'. I would like to tell him that this shehzada walked for 4,000 kilometres from Kanyakumari to Kashmir to listen to your (people's) problems, met my brothers and sisters, farmers and labourers and asked how we can resolve their problems,” she said.Addressing a rally in Gujarat on Thursday, PM Modi had targeted Congress MP Rahul Gandhi, saying Pakistan was eager to make the ‘shehzada' of the grand old party India's next PM as the country's enemies want a weak government at the helm.“On the other hand is your ‘shahanshah', Narendra Modiji. He lives in a palace. Have you ever seen him on TV? Clean clothes with not a single speck of dust, not a single stray hair strand. How will he ever understand your hard work, your farming? How will he understand your problems, that you are overburdened with inflation?” she said.In her speech, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also criticized PM Modi's governance, alleging that his policies have weakened the rights of the public, citing attempts to amend the Constitution and privatize government sectors.“When they say they want to change the Constitution, it means they want to reduce and weaken all the rights given to you in the Constitution. If you understand politics today, the biggest thing that Modi has done in the last 10 years is to weaken the rights of the public,” she said.She questioned PM Modi's decision to contest the Lok Sabha elections from Varanasi instead of Gujarat, attributing it to his detachment from the people of Gujarat, whom she claimed he had utilized for gaining power but subsequently forgotten.“Modi is surrounded by power and no longer recognises you. Why is he not contesting elections from here if he is not cut off from the people of Gujarat,” she asked.She said Modi was contesting from Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh and not Gujarat because he is cut off from the people of Gujarat.“He used you, earned power, name and respect with your support and went on to become the prime minister only to forget you and cut himself off from you,” she said.Gandhi also attacked Modi over his statement that Pakistan wanted to make Rahul Gandhi the next PM of India and use X-ray machines to steal ‘mangalsutra' and gold belonging to the public when voted to power.“The is in India, and Pakistan is being talked about...Such low-level utterances by the country's prime minister? You elected a prime minister to keep the country's respect intact, one whom the entire country could see talking sense, because this has been our tradition,"" she said.She alleged that the PM speaks a lot of lies.“Earlier it was limited to lies, now he utters such gibberish that Congress will steal one of your two buffaloes. Congress had been in power for 55 years, did it ever steal your buffalo and jewellery using an X-ray machine,” she asked.The PM is making such statements because the public is waking up and asking him not to make Hindu-Muslim the issue in an election and instead talk about electricity, water, jobs and inflation, she said.She said that the then Congress government formed cooperative sectors like Amul and Banas Dairy for the prosperity of farmers and claimed that today BJP leaders are trying to capture the sector.Equality is enshrined in the Constitution. “Today the prime minister himself says that those fighting for equality are anti-Constitution. You must understand how you are being misled,” she said.Gandhi also targeted Modi over unemployment and said that over 30 lakh central government posts are vacant.She claimed that the unemployment rate is the highest in 45 years and accused Modi of giving away government properties to billionaires which she claimed has reduced jobs. Privatisation of government jobs has ended reservations, she said.“Youth are jobless but the government is not filling these posts. You are focused elsewhere and not on job creation. When you don't get a job, you work for outsourcing and contract employment,” she said.“All the (country's) properties now belong to the billionaires. If the government understood (this) properly, they'd know that they need to create jobs...But he does not think about you...All policies are meant for billionaires,"" she said.She said Modi's biggest policy is to make everything ""for the success and prosperity of billionaires”.Gandhi said the now-scrapped Electoral Bonds were “a scheme for corruption”.“The government came out with a scheme for corruption. At one time, corruption was committed with stealth. Now it is being committed through a scheme. And you still have the gall to say you are honest and all other leaders are corrupt,” she said.She said the BJP became the world's richest political party by taking away the properties belonging to the public.In Banaskantha, which will go to polls in the third phase on May 7, the BJP has nominated Rekha Chaudhary, an engineering college professor and first-timer, against Congress' Thakor.(With inputs from agencies)","Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra launched a scathing attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

.

""Does Rahul Gandhi really want to win Amethi and Raebareli? If he really wanted to win Amethi, why would he give a Lok Sabha ticket to his peon from Amethi? Rahul Gandhi will lose both Raebareli and Amethi seats,"" he said.

""He (Rahul Gandhi) has run away from Amethi and as far as I believe, Rahul Gandhi will not ask for votes. There is Smriti Irani who just like a family gave love and respect to Amethi.

The BJP candidate also accused Sonia Gandhi of leaving Raebareli out of fear of losing, ""Sonia Gandhi left Raebareli in fear that if she loses, she will have to leave the 'das Janpath'. He (Rahul Gandhi) came, filed a nomination and left for Delhi. Dinesh Pratap Singh after filing his nomination, started moving in the streets of the villages of Raebareli,"" he said.

Singh also questioned the Gandhi family's lack of remembrance for Feroze Gandhi, the first MP from the area and the father of Rajiv and Sanjay Gandhi.

""Why doesn't the Gandhi family remember Feroze Gandhi, who was the first MP, from here? Feroze Gandhi's grave is 100 km away from here. Did Rahul Gandhi ever go there to offer flowers? In our culture, the relationship between grandfather and grandson is very sacred. If they do not believe in it, then they only consider the relationship as electoral,"" said the BJP candidate.

Following weeks of speculation the grand old party on Friday announced that Rahul Gandhi would contest from Raebareli, while KL Sharma would face off against Smriti Irani in Amethi.

The Amethi seat had been represented by Rahul Gandhi from 2004 to 2019, when he lost to Smriti Irani. Sonia Gandhi had also contested from Amethi in 1999 before passing the baton to Rahul in 2004.

Addressing a rally at Bodeli in Gujarat's Chhota Udepur, he said: ""When he (Rahul) lost from Amethi, he went to Wayanad. This time around, there was a risk in Wayanad.So, he fled to Rae Bareli. The problem is not with the constituencies, but with him. Rahul Gandhi will lose wherever he goes.

""Sonia Gandhi has launched 'Rahul Yaan' for the 21st time, but it will crash again,"" he said.In Daman, Shah took potshots at the INDIA bloc, saying they were facing a bankruptcy of leaders who could helm the country. ""There's no chance of the alliance winning. But, imagine if they do, who will be the PM? Can Sharad Pawar, Mamata Didi, M K Stalin or Uddhav Thackrey run this country? Don't laugh, but can Rahul baba run the country?""Shah accused Congress and its allies of spreading canards that PM Modi would abolish reservations if he won another term. It was the INDIA bloc that had robbed the quota meant for dalits, tribals and backward classes and given it to Muslims, he alleged, citing the examples of Karnataka and Andhra.""This is like the pot calling the kettle black. They snatched the reservation, but they are levelling allegations against Modi,"" he said.He accused the past Congress govts of going soft on terrorism out of fear that their vote bank would be upset.Dubbing AAP as an ""urban Naxal party"", Shah alleged in Vansda town of Navsari that if the Congress candidate won the Valsad seat, the Maoist menace would rear its head in the tribal region.Shah claimed Rahul had spread misinformation about the Covid-19 vaccine drive, urging tribals not to take the jab, which led to many deaths ""But, both brother and sister (Priyanka) clandestinely took the vaccine at night. They were not ashamed of playing politics in a pandemic,"" he alleged.In Daman, Shah said, ""For 23 years, he served as a CM and then as a PM, but Modi did not even take a Diwali break and instead spent time with jawans at the borders.

This can be understood only by those who have experienced poverty, those who have led a life of hardships.

They came to be known as the ""high potential boys"", a total of 10 shortlisted out of 135 following an evaluation of their performance in districts where they were posted for some time.AICC general secretary and J&K politician Ghulam Ahmed Mir recalls that Sharma and he, part of the first batch, were very young, and were sent to Amethi to look after the constituency.While Mir went on to become a name in Kashmir politics, Sharma, who hails from Ludhiana, stayed on with Amethi and Rae Bareli , spending four decades in the family borough. ""After the Nehru-Gandhi family, Sharma is the man best known to workers and locals,"" Mir said.No wonder, he was elated at his ""batchmate"" becoming the Congress candidate for the VIP seat. Mir now plans to campaign for his friend in the constituency he once managed for the party and its first family.Four decades of affiliation, from Rajiv Gandhi to Satish Sharma to Sonia Gandhi to Rahul Gandhi, and the resultant trust, is what made the Gandhis pick ""Kishoriji"" above any relative or loyalist as the standard bearer in the place identified with them.A soft-spoken Punjabi known for his man skills, Sharma has managed a low profile while delivering high results. As Sonia and Rahul worked on the national stage during the UPA decade, he was the go-to man who patiently listened to the demanding constituents used to having the personal ear of prime ministers and potential PMs, managing the local office and travelling across the region, with a team of aides. From time to time, he would also bring batches of people for personal audience with the VIPs, working overtime to keep all in good humour. The voters of Amethi-Rae Bareli-Sultanpur were famously known as pampered. In Delhi, he would operate faceless out of a South Avenue bungalow, attending to visitors from the family borough.What set him apart from others was that he stayed on in one place, building a wealth of knowledge about mohallas, villages, castes, and their political leanings. His data bank on demographics and a keen eye on shifting sands of local politics has served the party well, a reason why rivals found it hard to break through the fortress barring the occasional success. As Mir recalls, Sharma has stayed put for four decades, which is impossible for a political worker given personal aspirations.When Rahul came to politics in 2004, he built his team for the constituency, while Sharma looked after Rae Bareli. But he was the overall incharge, keeping an eye on the goings on. He also became an AICC secretary, looking after other states like Bihar.An aide joked that ""Kishoriji"" would find it difficult to fight polls because he would forever be concerned if his campaign team was managing as competently for him, as he has been doing for others. So highly is his work rated.Now, with a twist of fate turning him from a campaigner to a candidate, on a seat with eyes across the nation trained on, this is Sharma's moment to live up to his original billing as ""high potential boy"".",Kishori Lal Sharma is the first of the cadre of youngsters recruited by Rajiv Gandhi in 1983.

"How Congress finally managed to untangle Amethi, Rae Bareli knot",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-congress-finally-managed-to-untangle-amethi-rae-bareli-knot/articleshow/109846398.cms,"As Priyanka apparently against the idea of another Gandhi in Parliament stuck to her guns, Rahul had to contend with contesting alone in UP

NEW DELHI: It was not a minor coincidence that the day Rahul Gandhi 's Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra entered Rae Bareli on Feb 20 was also the day Sonia Gandhi was elected to Rajya Sabha from Rajasthan, marking her transition in Parliament and creating a vacancy that was at the root of the tortuous brainstorming which ended with Rahul's nomination from Rae Bareli on Friday.Rahul's switch from Amethi to Rae Bareli and Kishori Lal Sharma's elevation from a constituency manager to candidate, all at the last moment, marked the culmination of cogitation in Congress that made aligning available options with political objectives a Herculean task. In the end, Congress managed to land on its feet, as shown by the surge of emotion and support during the nomination in the patch of UP that once was known as the Gandhi family bastion, but has since morphed into a veritable challenge.Like all that turned the world upside down for Congress in the run up to Mandate 2024, the defeat in Decpolls in north India rekindled doubts among strategists who were eagerly waiting for wins in MP and Chhattisgarh to cement the party's claim in the twin seats. But within two months, as Rahul's yatra waded into the VIP pocket to a tumultuous welcome, Congress swung back from despair to hope.The assumption was that Priyanka Gandhi Vadra would replace mother Sonia in Rae Bareli, while Rahul would contest a second seat from Amethi, after Wayanad.Simple as it sounded, it turned out to be a far more complicated task.Though the discussion spanned two months, it is learnt that neither of the siblings were keen to contest. Rahul had scruples about the prospect of vacating Wayanad, which stood by him when he lost Amethi in 2019, while Priyanka apparently was against the idea of another Gandhi in Parliament, especially in the same. It was here that the Congress brass led by chief Mallikarjun Kharge started nudging the siblings that they should fight the elections from UP.Pressure was piled on Rahul that Rae Bareli could not be surrendered, as it represents a family legacy, starting with Feroze Gandhi who chose it for the first election post-independence in 1952 to Sonia Gandhi till 2024. Sources said Priyanka was nagged till as late as this week that she should take up the battle too.The concern was if Rahul shifted to Rae Bareli, BJP would land with a readymade attack line that he ran away from Amethi and Smriti Irani, his nemesis in last election. At the same time, some felt that Priyanka in Amethi would be a better strategic manoevure in the form of a ""woman vs woman"" contest.As if the multiple variables were not enough, allies and workers doubled their push for the Gandhi siblings to take up the cudgels, warning that a no-show would shatter the perception that the party had miraculously managed in what was supposed to be an impossible 2024 matchup against post-Ayodhya BJP.But as Priyanka stuck to her guns, Rahul had to contend with contesting alone in UP, even as the issue of family legacy hovered over the discussions to dictate the choice of seat. In the end, a reluctant Rahul agreed to contest from Rae Bareli to balance the umpteen equations. And Congress, left with no family friends like Satish Sharma in the past, fell back on constituency manager K L Sharma, who has been marshalling cadres and strategy for the past four decades.During this period, part of the delay was because Rahul and the party were careful that any public debate on the issue was only held after the voting concluded in Wayanad, lest it riled the voters in Kerala. In future too, vacating Wayanad would not be easy, as Congress would be preparing for Kerala assembly polls in 2026. Kerala is a priority for Congress since rival Left managed to win an unprecedented repeat term in 2021, triggering a crisis in state Congress while a covetous BJP is trying hard to step into any opening.Notwithstanding BJP's trolling that Rahul ran away from Amethi, stakes remain high for the Gandhi family in its former borough. With K L Sharma by her side and a packed crowd in front, Priyanka told the nomination rally in Amethi that she would return on May 6 and would camp there till the end of election.As days pass, it would be clear that it is the family's equity on the ballot despite Sharma being the candidate.","Rahul's switch from Amethi to Rae Bareli and Kishori Lal Sharma's elevation from a constituency manager to candidate marked the culmination of cogitation in Congress.

HYDERABAD: Eight years after PhD student Rohith Vemula died by suicide over alleged caste-linked discrimination at University of Hyderabad , Telangana Police has filed a closure report saying that nobody was to blame for his death and that Vemula was not even a Dalit .Citing lack of evidence to incriminate the then VC and others for abetment of Vemula’s suicide in a hostel room on January 17, 2016, the closure report insinuates he possibly feared being exposed for allegedly acquiring an SC certificate fraudulently.An outcry over the report, submitted to LB Nagar sessions court on March 21, led DGP Ravi Gupta to reopen the probe late on Friday.Doubts have been expressed by the mother of the deceased and others over the conduct of the investigation... A petition will be filed requesting the magistrate to permit further investigation into the case,” the DGP said.Vemula’s family said they would legally challenge the report, which they termed “full of lies” and farcical. “After his suicide, Rahul Gandhi and Congress supported our cause and promised to stand by us till justice is delivered. But within four months after their party came to office in Telangana, police closed the case. This is extremely shocking. We are all heartbroken with the findings,” Vemula’s brother Raja told TOI from Vijayawada.The report claims that the Guntur district administration cancelled SC certificates obtained by Vemula and his family members after finding out that they were from OBC Vaddera community.A case of abetment of suicide and other charges under Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, had been registered against ex-VC Apparao Podile, then Union minister and Secunderabad MP Bandaru Dattatreya, BJP’s N Ramchander Rao, and university students Krishna Chaitanya, Nandanama Susheel Kumar and Nandanam Diwakar.They were charged with harassing Vemula because of his caste and driving him to suicide.The closure report mentions a letter from Dattatreya to then Union HRD minister Smriti Irani’s office, quoting a complaint by ABVP about campus disturbances. It also cites a representation on the matter by Rao to ex-VC Podile.“The action taken (against Vemula and his friends) by the university authorities cannot be attributed to Bandaru Dattatreya and Ramchander Rao. None of the proctorial board members or the executive council stated that they were aware of any such communication to the VC and they acted independently,” the report states.The report says that being prosecuted for fraudulently obtaining an SC certificate would have led to Vemula losing the academic degree he had earned over the years.It also declares there is no evidence of harassment by the ex-VC, who had suspended Vemula and four other students from their hostels.According to the investigating officer, Podile took a lenient view and reduced the original punishment of expulsion for one semester, hostel and scholarship.“In view of this leniency, it cannot be said that the VC discriminated against Rohith Vemula and his friends,” the report says.It mentions that in Dec 2015, Vemula wrote a letter to the vice-chancellor asking him to provide poison and a rope to die by suicide.“If this can be considered an indication for suicide, it was written a month prior to that (expulsion) and could have been due to disappointment and anger, and (which) might have died down due to lapse of time.”The report says that Vemula’s parents were separated and that he was more involved in politics on campus than studies.",Rohith Vemula died by suicide in January 2016 over alleged caste-linked discrimination at University of Hyderabad.

London Mayor to be announced

Britain's Labour Party urged Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to call a general election after his governing Conservative Party suffered heavy losses in local elections in England.The Tories lost around half the seats they contested. In contrast, Labour won councils that the party hasn't held for decades, regional mayorships, and a special election for the Blackpool South seat in parliament.""Here in Blackpool, a message has been sent directly to the prime minister,"" Labour leader Keir Starmer said.""This was directly to Rishi Sunak to say we are fed up with your decline, your chaos and your division and we want change,"" Starmer added.Sunak has the power to decide the general election date, but it must be held before January 28 next year at the latest.He struck a defiant note after the Conservative Ben Houchen won re-election as the mayor of the northern region of Tees Valley.""Come a general election, [voters] are going to stick with us too,"" Sunak said.The chairman of the Conservative Party, Richard Holden, said it had been ""a tough night.""National polls suggest Labour is 20 percentage points ahead of theConservatives in terms of general election choices.According to the BBC, if replicated in a nationwide contest, the initial tallies suggested Labour would win 34 percent of the vote, with the Tories trailing by nine points.Sky News' projection for a general election using the partial results would see Labour become the largest party but short of an overall majority.Results will continue to come in over the weekend, including the key mayoral contest in London, where Labour's Sadiq Khan hopes to be re-elected.Elsewhere, the centrist Liberal Democrats and the Green Party also made gains, as did Reform UK, which is trying to take voters from the Conservatives on the right.Yet there seems to be no apparent moves amongst Tories to replace Sunak, which at this point would barely be possible in time for an election campaign.Sunak has previously said he was eyeing a vote in the ""second half of 2024.""","Tories lose half the seats they contested in local elections in England.

Labour won control of councils in England that the party hasn’t held for decades and was successful in a special by-election for Parliament that, if repeated in the general election, would lead to one of the Conservatives’ biggest-ever defeats.Though the results overall, admittedly on a low turnout, make for grim reading for PM Rishi Sunak , he was able to breathe a sigh of relief when Conservative mayor of Tees Valley in the northeast of England was reelected, albeit with a depressed share of the vote.The victory of Ben Houchen , who ran a very personal campaign, may be enough to cushion Sunak from any revolt by Conservative lawmakers.For Keir Starmer , Labour Party leader, it’s generally been a stellar set of results, with the only real negative coming in some areas with large Muslim populations, such as Blackburn and Oldham, where the party’s candidates appear to have suffered as a result of the leadership’s pro-Israel stance in the conflict in Gaza.","Britain's governing Conservative Party suffered heavy losses in local election results Friday.

The families of former chief ministers S Bangarappa and BS Yediyurappa have locked horns in yet another political battle in Shimoga constituency , which goes to the polls on Tuesday.Spicing up an otherwise regular electoral bout between the two families is the entry of former deputy chief minister KS Eshwarappa, who has openly defied the BJP brass and has been dismissed from the party.Eshwarappa, who had taken ticket denial in the 2023 elections in his stride, didn't take kindly to the party - with which he had been since its birth - denying ticket to his son KE Kanthesh this election. Believing that Yediyurappa and his sons were behind it, he has vowed out to teach them a 'lesson' by denting the prospects of sitting MP BY Raghavendra, the elder son of the BJP strongman. Speaking to STOI, he asserted he was contesting only to rid the BJP of its illusion that Yediyurappa and his family are indispensable for the party in Karnataka.Knowing well that Hindutva sells better in Shivamogga, Eshwarappa has been constantly highlighting how Yediyurappa and his sons have sidelined hardcore Hindutva ideologues like CT Ravi, Nalin Kumar Kateel, and DV Sadananda Gowda. He is also banking on women self-help groups which have benefited from his family-run microfinancing company and Tamilians who constitute around 25,000 of the electorate.While it remains to be seen how many votes Eshwarappa will snatch from Raghavendra's camp, his rebellion has certainly buoyed the Congress camp. ""The more votes he takes, the brighter our chances of victory,"" said Basavarajappa, a Congress worker who runs a shop in Eesuru village in the segment.Congress' confidence is reflected in the campaigning of its candidate, Geetha Shivarajkumar, Bangarappa's daughter and wife of Sandalwood star Shivarajkumar. With her husband and her brother Madhu Bangarappa, a minister in the Siddaramaiah govt, throwing their all into the campaigning for the past month, Geetha is seeking to end her family's losing streak against the Yediyurappa family.This is the fifth time the families are facing off in a Lok Sabha election , and the Bangarappas haven't won even once previously.Geetha is also banking on Congress govt's five guarantees and the party's promise to give Rs 1 lakh a year to women heads of families if it wins the Lok Sabha polls . ""Since the constituency is predominantly dominated by backward classes, SCs and STs, and most of them have benefited from the Congress' guarantees, Geetha's victory seems certain,"" said Naveen, a Congress sympathiser. She and her brother have also been working to consolidate about four lakh votes from their own community - the Idigas. A few film actors, including Duniya Vijay, have also been drawing good crowds to her meetings and rallies.On his part, Raghavendra is banking on his father's popularity among voters cutting across caste barriers, PM Narendra Modi's appeal, and the unprecedented development works the constituency, especially in urban pockets, has witnessed over the past decade. Be it building national highways, improving district and village roads, introducing more rails or constructing an airport, people believe Yediyurappa and Raghavendra have been instrumental. ""Raghanna is a worker,"" is what even his opponents say.The Yediyurappa family is also campaigning aggressively, leaving nothing to chance as it is aware that losing Shivamogga will end the family's grip on the state BJP unit, considering the growing opposition to them within the party after BY Vijayendra, the younger son of Yediyurappa, took over as the state party president.""We do realise the importance of winning this election and the necessity of overcoming Eshwarappa's rebellion. But my performance as an MP and Modi's popularity will help me win. People are also aware it is Modi's election and they should vote for BJP,"" Raghavendra said.",The families of former chief ministers S Bangarappa and BS Yediyurappa have locked horns in yet another political battle in Shimoga constituency.

Lingayat: Can Congress breach BJP's stronghold in Kittur Karnataka after 20 years?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/lok-sabha-elections/lok-sabha-election-news/can-congress-breach-bjps-stronghold-in-kittur-karnataka-after-20-years/articleshow/109850498.cms,"BENGALURU: The Lingayat-dominated Kittur Karnataka region, popularly known as Mumbai-Karnataka, has become a BJP stronghold over the past four general elections — precisely two decades — with the saffron party winning almost all the Lok Sabha seats since 2004.The previous BJP govt renamed the region, formerly part of the Bombay presidency before Independence, as ‘Kittur Karnataka’.This region comprises seven districts — Uttara Kannada, Belagavi, Dharwad, Vijayapura, Bagalkot, Gadag, and Haveri. The name ‘Kittur’ pays homage to a historical taluk in Belagavi district ruled by Rani Chennamma (1778-1829), renowned for her resistance to the British, preceding the famed exploits of Jhansi Rani Lakshmibai.Among the seven Lok Sabha seats of the region, the saffron party lost only once — in Chikkodi in 2014 to Congress .This time, though, all the seats are witnessing a tight and direct contest between the BJP and Congress, with JD(S) choosing to contest only from three seats in south Karnataka.For BJP, securing a significant number of seats is imperative to maintaining its overall tally above 15 in the state, which it has consistently done since 1999.Despite its sweeping victory in the region in 2019, BJP faces stiff challenges this time. By deftly leveraging the Lingayat card, Congress effectively countered BJP’s influence in the 2023 assembly polls, capturing 33 of 50 seats in the region. In 2018, BJP had won 30 assembly seats, while the Congress got 17.In the 2023 assembly polls, the Congress capitalized on the Lingayat community’s discontent over the denial of reservation enhancement to Panchamasalis — a major sub-sect of Lingayats. Additionally, the party gained momentum after BJP refused party ticket to two prominent Lingayat leaders — former chief minister Jagadish Shettar and former deputy CM Laxman Savadi. This decision dealt a blow to the saffron party. Shettar, contesting on Congress ticket from Hubballi-Dharwad Rural assembly constituency, lost to a newcomer, while Savadi secured victory in Athani by a substantial margin.Since then, there have been significant developments. Shettar rejoined the BJP camp, while Savadi is actively engaged in campaigning for Congress though speculation is rife that he may be leaning towards a “ghar wapsi” (returning home) to his former party.Ultimately, the outcome hinges on the voting behaviour of the Lingayat community, a dominant force in many constituencies. Congress is optimistic Lingayats will continue to support it, as they did in the 2023 polls, based on its guarantees which have since been implemented.BJP, however, exudes confidence in the ‘Modi factor’ and believes that the recent tragedy involving the murder of MBA student Neha Hiremath by her former college-mate in Hubballi will sway voters in its favour, particularly tapping into the anger within the Lingayat community. But Congress functionaries argue the Prajwal Revanna episode has effectively neutralized this sentiment.","The Lingayat-dominated Kittur Karnataka region, popularly known as Mumbai- Karnataka, has become a BJP stronghold over the past four general elections.

He helped us. We convinced Trinamool people to do all this (level the allegations). They (the complainants) never said no, they did whatever we told them to do. He (Adhikari) had told us that if we could not do this, if we could not get the big shots (Trinamool seniors of the area) arrested, we would not be able to stand (survive) here,"" Koyal is heard saying. ""I had to do all this very smartly. We said it (the alleged rapes and torture) happened seven-eight months ago. We had to work hard,"" he adds.Trinamool, including party chief Mamata Banerjee and national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee, latched on to the video. The CM first took to X and then spoke at length at public meetings in Nadia's Chakdah and Taherpur on Saturday. ""The sting shows how deep the rot is within BJP. In their hatred for Bengal's progressive thought and culture, the Bangla birodhis (the anti-Bengal brigade) orchestrated a conspiracy to defame our state at every possible level. Never before in the history of India has a ruling party in Delhi tried to malign an entire state and its people. History will witness how Bengal will rise in rage against Delhi's conspiratorial regime and ensure their bisarjan (defeat),"" she wrote on the X platform.Adhikari himself was more guarded in his initial response, opting not to say anything directly about its contents: ""I have not seen the video. I will find out whose voice it is and then speak on this matter."" Later on Saturday, he said truth could be ""twisted and a misleading version circulated"". ""But its shelf life is very, very short. Ultimately, truth prevails,"" he added. ""I will approach the CBI and seek a full probe so that the perpetrators are punished,"" Adhikari said.One of the first Sandeshkhali complainants and now BJP's candidate from Basirhat, Rekha Patra, called the video a Trinamool ""ploy"".""The video is fake, there is no truth in it. Koyal is a BJP man, he can never say all this,"" she said. But she also added that Trinamool Congress ""may have threatened Koyal to say all this"".The video shows BJP mandal president Gangadhar Koyal crediting Suvendu Adhikari for everything. “It was he (Adhikari) who controlled.... Why has the Sandeshkhali movement survived for so long? He is still holding on, that is why. No one else has the ability to sustain this movement for so long,” he says in the video. “Empty pockets (khali haat) canot do all this,” he replies when the interviewer asks him whether Adhikari sent mobile phones and money.Koyal is also heard saying some women backed off from making complaints because they were scared of going to police stations and of the investigations that would follow. The video shows a woman saying she backed out because she had not been instructed properly. BJP Sandeshkhali Block-I president Shanti Dolui is seen nodding in agreement with the interviewer when asked whether the pistols recovered by central agencies later were “planted”. The male interviewer remains unidentified throughout the video but, from the body language of Koyal and others, it appears they are comfortable with him and know him.“You scripted a good drama on Sandeshkhali,” CM Mamata Banerjee later said in Chakdah. “The fact has been unveiled. I have been telling you all for some time that this is a conspiracy and a BJP-scripted drama. I have heard of this expose from the media and have not seen it in detail myself but I will definitely see it,” she added, tying it up with the molestation allegations against governor C V Ananda Bose: “Centre’s representative, the honourable governor, have you seen what he has done, what he does with Raj Bhavan employees, calls girls and molests them?And then Modi spends the night there and leaves. The person who gives a big sandesh (message) on Sandeshkhali: why have you not given one sandesh to governor?”Koyal himself later called the “viral video a conspiracy and a plot”. “They have used technology to fake my voice. This is a ploy to defame me, my party, the mothers of Sandeshkhali and my leader (Adhikari),” he added.","The 33-minute video focuses on Sandeshkhali Block-II BJP mandal president Gangadhar Koyal.

Prajwal Revanna sex scandal: Karnataka in turmoil; here's what we know so far

Controversy over Prajwal Revanna's scandalous video escalates in Karnataka. SIT issues lookout notice, FIR filed, political tensions rise amid BJP-JD(S) alliance for upcoming elections.

BENGALURU: The recent series of incidents, starting with the Neha Hiremath murder in Hubballi followed by PM Narendra Modi’s reference to the snatching of mangalsutra and Congress and BJP’s focus on women voters, along with the Prajwal Revanna sex videos scandal, has brought attention to the significance of women voters in the elections . Both parties are now eyeing the women electorate as crucial to their fortunes in the 14 constituencies of north Karnataka scheduled to see polls on Tuesday.Approximately 1.2 crore women are eligible to vote in the region, with the highest number registered in Gulbarga constituency.An analysis of data from the first phase of the Lok Sabha elections in the state reveals that a little over 1 crore women, accounting for more than 69.6 % of the registered women electors, participated in the voting process on April 26. In comparison, the male voter turnout, also of a little over 1 crore, was 69.4% of the total electorate. Mandya constituency saw the highest female voter turnout, with 7.3 lakh votes cast, representing 81% of the registered women voters.“We’ve witnessed a heartening turnout of women voters at the polling stations and we’re hopeful they’ve cast their ballot in favour of the Congress due to our guarantees. But on the flip side, the PM’s mangalsutra narrative may have resonated among many Hindu women. We’ll have to see if the same trend continues in phase 2,” said a senior Congress functionary and state minister.The larger issue that has emerged since the completion of the first phase of polling is the Prajwal Revanna sex scandal and rape case. Hassan, the epicentre of the scandal involving the incumbent MP, witnessed 6.7 lakh votes cast by women, accounting for 77.3% of the registered women voters.There is a prevailing sentiment within Congress that the sex scandal could “offset” the negative impact of the Neha murder, which equally shocked the nation.On the other hand, the BJP believes that the Revanna case has shifted public attention away from ‘constructive debates’ on selecting the next PM.",There is a prevailing sentiment within Congress that the sex scandal could “ offset” the negative impact of the Neha Hiremath murder.

HYDERABAD: Chief minister A Revanth Reddy on Saturday assured Radhika Vemula that justice will be ensured by reinvestigating the case of her son Rohith Vemula , a student of University of Hyderabad who died by suicide in 2016. The CM gave this assurance when Radhika called on him and demanded justice for her son.Cyberabad police had filed a closure report in the case, but the CMO forwarded Radhika Vemula's representation to DGP Ravi Gupta with an instruction to re-investigate the case.The DGP, in turn, sent it to Cyberabad police.The then AICC vice president Rahul Gandhi had visited the University of Hyderabad and joined the students' protests, demanding justice for Rohith Vemula. He had also sought an apology from the Modi govt then.In its closure report on Rohith Vemula's death, Telangana police had claimed he was not a Dalit and died by suicide in 2016 as he feared that his ""real caste"" would be discovered.The DGP said the investigation officer in the case was the assistant commissioner of police, Madhapur, and that the final closure report was prepared before Nov 2023, based on the investigation. The final closure report was officially filed in the concerned court on March 21, 2024. In its closure report, police had also given a clean chit to accused, citing lack of evidence with regard to allegations of abetment and the SC & ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. The university's then vice-chancellor Appa Rao Podile, then Union minister Bandaru Dattatreya, BJP ex-MLC N Ramachander Rao and some ABVP leaders were among accused.However, the closure report by the Telangana police, claiming that Rohith Vemula was not a Dalit, has the potential to cause embarrassment to the ruling Congress in Telangana as it had given the much-needed ammunition to the opposition BRS and BJP.Congress had vehemently targeted the Modi government then, alleging discrimination against Dalits in educational institutions. Congress had demanded the sacking of then HRD minister Smriti Irani and then Union minister Bandaru Dattatreya and also removal of Appa Rao.What has come as a blow to Congress is that it promised, in its election manifesto, to bring in a Rohith Vemula Act to address discrimination against students belonging to the backward communities in educational institutions.Meanwhile, the DGP has also said a petition would be filed in the court concerned requesting the magistrate to permit further investigation in the case.Soon after Rohith Vemula's family contested the findings of the police probe into his suicide on six different grounds, Telangana police are now in the process of seeking court's permission to reinvestigate the case.""Based on the representation given by Rohith's family members who expressed doubts over the investigation, a petition will be moved in the court seeking reinvestigation. If the court permits, we will reinvestigate the case,"" a senior police officer told STOI.Once the court gives nod, an assistant commissioner of police rank officer will be appointed as investigating officer to probe the case afresh, sources confirmed. In their closure report that came to light on Friday, Cyberabad police declared that it was not a case of abetment to suicide, and as per the report submitted by the Guntur district authorities Rohith belonged to an OBC community and was not a Dalit.It is learnt that Cyberabad police filed the closure report in March in the lower court since Telangana high court had repeatedly questioned police for undue delay in completing the investigation. It was after eight long years, the investigators concluded the case by filing the closure report.","Chief minister A Revanth Reddy assured Radhika Vemula that justice will be ensured by reinvestigating the case of her son.

Getting AIIMS to Raichur will be my utmost priority: Kumar Naik,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/lok-sabha-elections/lok-sabha-election-news/getting-aiims-to-raichur-will-be-my-utmost-priority-kumar-naik/city/hubballi/getting-aiims-to-raichur-will-be-my-utmost-priority-kumar-naik/articleshow/109850824.cms,"Hoping to liberate

From

bureaucrat to politician, was politics a choice or happen by chance?

As

you know, Raichur has gained very little compared to the long list of all it lost over the years. How do you plan to address this disparity?

What

has been the people's response to the five guarantee schemes? Would they help you reap the political dividend?

Does

Kumar Naik have any special plans for Raichur?

has determined to wrest the seat from BJP and fielded former additional chief secretary G Kumar Naik as its candidate. Known to lose development projects in the past, the people of Raichur are keen on electing a leader who could change the district's landscape and provide enough opportunities for the overall development of the district.Excerpts from his interview on the sidelines of his busy campaign.Bureaucracy and politics go hand in hand. One is incomplete without the other. Be it the bureaucracy or politics, my objective had always been serving people. As a bureaucrat over the last three decades, regardless of the positions I held, I have always connected with the people and tried my best to resolve their problem. Hence, it is a continuous journey but in a different capacity.I completely agree with you. Be it the AIIMS, irrigation projects, or infrastructural push, the district is always lagging behind other districts. If elected, getting AIIMS to Raichur will be my utmost priority and will ensure enough funds for the ongoing mobility and infrastructure projects. My experience in bureaucracy will be like a shot in the arm, as I know how to get funds from the Centre to the district. Besides, all the district leaders are extending their full cooperation .The state govt has successfully implemented the five guarantee schemes that were promised. The schemes have provided relief to the citizens from the pinching inflation. This has helped in gaining the trust and confidence of the voters. It is not just one section of the society that has been benefitted, but all have been benefitted alike. Now, our national manifesto also talks of similar guarantees to different sections of society. This goodwill of citizens in favour of the state govt's administration will help us again in reclaiming Raichur from the BJP.I want to address the gap in providing quality education, focus on resolving malnutrition and put an end to the mass exodus of people from various parts of Raichur to urban areas in search of better livelihood by creating enough employment opportunities.","Congress fielded former additional chief secretary G Kumar Naik as its candidate.

How do you think this election will change the situation?

BJP says their agenda for this election is 'Ram, ration aur shasan'. Do you agree?

The central govt says it is giving

free ration

to 80 crore people. Do you think it will affect the electorate at some level?

Having come this far in politics, who have you learnt more from? Netaji (Mulayam) or Akhilesh (husband)?

Seeking her fourth term as a member of parliament, Samajwadi Party's Dimple Yadav has several firsts to her credit. She is the first woman in Uttar Pradesh to be elected unopposed to the parliament, and the first MP from the state whose husband was a chief minister. Having won the 2022 bypoll from Mainpuri, which had fallen vacant following the death of her father-in-law and SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav, Dimple is now seeking a fresh term from the same constituency.Talking to Neha Lalchandani a day before the end of campaigning for the third phase of election, she said that this time people will vote for change. Excerpts:I think what stands out is the current situation in the country. The BJP govt is following 'dabaav ki niti' ( pressure tactics ). We have been seeing this for the last 10 years. Farmers want to protest peacefully but they are not given permission. We have seen the use of force against students at JNU and BHU, and against teachers protesting due to lack of recruitments. This govt is not inclined to allow people to raise their voice. It wants no protests. However, the Constitution gives us the right to express ourselves, and the govt is suppressing the right to expression.This is the election for change . BJP has started the trend of destroying democracy . See how senior leaders of other parties are being sent to jail. The impact of pressure tactics is being felt in cities as well as rural areas. SP lost three seats of chairperson in Mainpuri in local body polls where record of counting was not available. This should not have happened. Everyone can see how the party in power is trying to manipulate things. People want a change now.Not at all. This is not a religious fight but a political one. This is the struggle for ideology. BJP is not benefitting anyone.Compare the quality of food people were getting 10 years ago and what the govt is giving them now. Earlier, they used to get rice, flour, sugar, and kerosene oil. Now they are being given 'bajra'. The situation on the ground is bad and people are upset as the quality of 'bajra' is so bad that it is not even fit for animals. The govt's aim is not to serve the country but to distract attention from real issues. They do not want to talk about relevant issues.If we really want to learn, we learn something from everyone around us. Everyone comes with their own special experiences, and we can learn from everyone in life. I am also trying to do that.","Dimple Yadav is the first woman in Uttar Pradesh to be elected unopposed to the parliament, and the first MP from the state whose husband was a chief minister.
