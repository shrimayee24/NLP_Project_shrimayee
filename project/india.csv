Lapsed 5% Muslim quota in Maha formally nullified,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lapsed-5-muslim-quota-in-maha-formally-nullified/articleshow/128534765.cms,"Chief Minister of Maharashtra Devendra Fadnavis

Mumbai: Eleven years after the BJP-Sena govt led by Devendra Fadnavis scrapped the 5% Muslim quota in govt jobs and education, the Mahayuti govt has cancelled a circular outlining the process of issuing caste validity certificates for the quota. Officials said the long-delayed process was completed after a query was raised in the last state assembly session.The 5% minority quota had been introduced by the Congress-NCP govt led in June 2014. However, the ordinance lapsed by Dec 2014 since it had not been converted into an Act under the subsequent BJP-Sena govt led by Fadnavis. A high court petition also led to a stay on the quota for jobs.In March 2015, the Fadnavis govt issued an order officially cancelling the ordinance. However, a related circular on caste validity certificates for minorities issued by the social justice department was overlooked. It is this circular which has now been cancelled. ""This is just a formality,"" said an official.",The 5% minority quota had been introduced by the Congress-NCP govt led in June 2014.

NDA Rajya Sabha tally set to cross 130 as 37 seats go to polls in March,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nda-rajya-sabha-tally-set-to-cross-130-as-37-seats-go-to-polls-in-march/articleshow/128525129.cms,"Rajya Sabha (File photo)

NEW DELHI: The governing NDA is set to further strengthen its tally in the Upper House after biennial polls for 37 seats in Rajya Sabha on March 16, but the fate of prominent retiring members such as Sharad Pawar (NCP-SP), Abhishek Manu Singhvi (Congress), Ramdas Athawale (RPI-A), Tiruchi Siva (DMK) and Priyanka Chaturvedi (Sena UBT) will depend on how their respective parties coordinate with their alliance partners.BJP-led NDA's tally is expected to cross 130 with the advantage of at least four additional members in Rajya Sabha, whose current strength is 243 with one vacancy each in Jharkhand and West Bengal.The states where seats will be vacant in April are Maharashtra (7 seats), Tamil Nadu (6 ), West Bengal (5), Bihar (5 ), Odisha (4), Assam (3), Telangana, Chhattisgarh, Haryana (2 each), and Himachal Pradesh (1).NDA has govts in six - Maharashtra, Odisha, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Haryana and Assam - of the 10 states where seats will be vacant due to members retiring, giving it a clear advantage. The opposition alliance has govts in Himachal Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and West Bengal.In Maharashtra, since the governing coalition, Mahayuti, is expected to secure six seats as against one by opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi, it's advantage NDA in the state.On the other hand, MVA will see a lot of political maneuvering as the alliance will have to choose between the candidates of Sena UBT and NCP(SP). In case NCP(SP) sticks with Pawar, it is to be seen whether NCP extends his support to him amid talks of a merger of the factions.Despite not having the numbers, NCP (SP) working president Supriya Sule didn't rule out the possibility of nominating her father, claiming that a MVA meeting would be held soon to finalise a name.The seven Rajya Sabha members from Maharashtra whose terms are set to expire on April 2 are Pawar, Fauzia Khan (NCP-SP), Bhagwat Kishanrao Karad (BJP), Dhairyasheel Patil (BJP), Athawale, Chaturvedi and Rajani Patil (Congress).In Bihar, polls will be held for five seats, three of which are held by governing NDA, including two by JDU.RJD, the principal opposition party in the state, has only 25 MLAs, leaving the combined strength of the alliance (Congress and the Left) at 35 - five less than the number it would require to retain an RS berth. In this scenario, it would be extremely difficult for RJD to repeat MP and former Union minister Prem Ch-and Gupta in the Upper House.In West Bengal, the governing Trinamool Congress is expected to win four of the five RS seats while the opposition BJP may secure one.","BJP-led NDA's tally is expected to cross 130 with the advantage of at least four additional members in Rajya Sabha.

NAGPUR: In a ruling clarifying the legal status of electronic communication in criminal proceedings, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court last week held that summons issued through WhatsApp is legally valid under Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023, and set aside an order imposing costs on a police personnel for effecting such service,.Justice Urmila Joshi-Phalke quashed a Jan 21 order of a Pocso court in Nagpur which directed recovery of costs from constable Santosh Ramteke on the ground that summons served through a mobile phone was ""not allowed"". The court faulted the trial court for ignoring amended provisions under BNSS.The Pocso court noted that two prosecution witnesses in a pending case were absent and that the summons was served via mobile phone, resulting in delay in recording evidence. The court imposed costs on the constable for not serving the summons through a ""legal mode"". The Maharashtra govt challenged the trial court order, filing a criminal plea on behalf of Lakadganj police station.The state argued that the trial court overlooked BNSS section 70 under which electronically served summons are deemed legally valid, and section 530 which permits trials, inquiries and proceedings, including service of summons, to be conducted in electronic mode.Justice Joshi-Phalke observed that the purpose of service is to put a person on notice and that ""the mode is surely irrelevant""."," Bombay HC rules that summons issued through WhatsApp is legally valid under Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023.
