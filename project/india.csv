PATNA: A controversy over an alleged remark by Uttarakhand minister Rekha Arya’s husband Girdhari Lal Sahu that “Bihar girls are available for marriage for Rs 20,000-Rs 25,000” deepened Saturday. MP Pappu Yadav demanded Sahu’s tongue be “chopped off”. MLA IP Gupta announced a Rs 10-lakh reward for anyone who brings Sahu to Bihar. RJD women workers burnt his effigy.The controversy erupted after a video went viral from BJP-ruled Uttarakhand in which Sahu was purportedly seen interacting with a group of young men, asking about their marital status and suggesting marriages could be arranged with “Bihar girls at low cost”.“People must chop off the tongues of persons making derogatory remarks... Either they be eliminated with speedy trials or their tongues be chopped off,” Independent Purnia MP Yadav said. He alleged that some made such statements merely for “political gains” while ignoring bigger issues of public concern and poverty.RJD activists breathed fire as they burnt Sahu’s effigy. “The protest is a warning that such comments won’t be tolerated,” an RJD spokesman said.",Controversy over alleged remark by Uttarakhand minister Rekha Arya's husband Girdhari Lal Sahu.

Key Hindu candidate barred from contesting Bangladesh polls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/key-hindu-candidate-barred-from-contesting-bangladesh-polls/articleshow/126330070.cms,"NAGPUR: Amid persecution of minorities in Bangladesh and rising concerns in India, the nomination of a key Hindu candidate, Gobindadeb Pramanik was rejected Saturday by the returning officer. Pramanik sought to contest as an Independent from Gopalganj-3 in the February 12 polls. Ousted PM Sheikh Hasina was the MP from this seat, which has over 50% Hindu voters.Pramanik is also general secretary of Bangladesh Jatiya Hindu Mahajote. An apolitical organisation, it is an alliance of 23 outfits and is considered a Hindutva fountainhead in the country.A provision in Bangladesh’s electoral laws, which requires an Independent candidate to submit signatures of 1% of the voters in the constituency backing the candidature, was invoked by returning officer to turn down his nomination, said Pramanik.Talking to TOI from Gopalganj, Pramanik alleged that after he had managed to secure 1% signatures, workers of Bangladesh Nationalist Party threatened those who signed in his favour with dire consequences. They were asked to turn up before returning officer and say that their signatures were not taken or were wrongly submitted. Following this, returning officer rejected the nomination on grounds of “invalid” signatures.Pramanik said he preferred to fight as an Independent because he had support. He pointed out that 51% of the around 3 lakh voters in Gopalganj are Hindus, adding BNP resorted to such tactics as it does not stand a chance. “Although the signatures of 1% of my voters were correct, the district returning officer did not accept the affidavits. The officer ruled that the signatures were not valid. I shall file an appeal before the election commission and may even move HC after that. ”Another Hindu candidate, Dulal Biswas, also saw his papers turned back. Since Biswas was fielded by a registered political party, Gono Forum, the 1% voters’ affidavit rule did not apply to him. The application was stayed for want of papers, and he got a chance to submit the documents afresh, a source said.In nearby Gopalganj 2, another Independent Hindu candidate, Utpal Biswas, is in the fray. The seat was once represented by Hasina’s cousin Sheikh Salim. “I work among the farmers and the downtrodden. I expect that they will vote for me,” Biswas said.","Gobindadeb Pramanik sought to contest as an Independent from Gopalganj-3.

Vague claims against in-laws insufficient for prosecution: Karnataka HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/vague-claims-against-in-laws-insufficient-for-prosecution-karnataka-hc/articleshow/126329862.cms,"Heartbreak, divorce & deadly crimes | Dark Truth Of Failed Marriages | Ft. Anand Handa

BENGALURU: Karnataka high court has observed that mere assertion that in-laws “instigated” the husband or used abusive language, without any specific instance of such misdemeanour, cannot form the foundation for criminal prosecution. Quashing the proceedings against one Abeda, her husband Mohammad Runkuddin Jumna, and five others, Justice Sachin Shankar Magadum noted that if the court declines to exercise its inherent jurisdiction, then the petitioners “would be unnecessarily subjected to the rigmarole of criminal prosecution”.Under the circumstances, continuation of proceedings against the petitioners would amount to abuse of the process of law, Justice Magadum observed. The couple, residents of Kalaburagi city, along with their family members, had challenged FIR registered by women’s police station and pending proceedings before local court, based on a complaint filed by Tehseen Begum, their daughter-in-law.The petitioners stated Tehseen had acknowledged in her written complaint dated July 22, 2023, that she lived separately, with her husband Nooruddin Jumna. “All allegations pertaining to neglect, marital discord, & harassment are specifically directed only at Nooruddin.There are absolutely no individual or specific allegations against any of us.”Justice Magadum noted, “The complainant explicitly acknowledges there was a family partition, pursuant to which, a separate residential portion comprising three rooms was allotted. This itself indicates that the petitioners lived separately and did not share the common household with the complainant.” He added, “The complaint repeatedly refers to the prolonged stays of Nooruddin in Gulf region, which appears to be the primary reason for marital discord. The allegations against the petitioners are, therefore, unsubstantiated, lacking any particulars of date, time, place, or specific acts.”","Karnataka high court quashes proceedings against one Abeda, her husband Mohammad Runkuddin Jumna, and five others.
