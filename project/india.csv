Urging that the party win back the votes it has lost after 2009, he said it can be done only through constructive criticism and not by unrelenting negativity. He said Congress has an illustrious history but the “young voters who are a majority today, do not give much importance to history, and want to know what we will do for them today and what kind of tomorrow we can give them. Our resolution will be judged by that and that is what we must focus on.”“Congress must be a party of hope, not of resentment. Of positivity and not just negativism. Of the future and not just the past, and of positive narrative and not just criticism,” he said.","Sachin Pilot and Shashi Tharoor got the pride of place at the AICC session here.
