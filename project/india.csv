Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal gets bail in excise policy case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/arvind-kejriwal-gets-bail-in-excise-policy-case/articleshow/111144956.cms,"'Truth can be troubled, not defeated'

NEW DELHI: Delhi's Rouse Avenue Court on Thursday granted bail to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on a bond of Rs 1 lakh in the money laundering case related to the alleged excise policy case. The court also declined Enforcement Directorate (ED) prayer to stay the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader's bail order for 48 hours.Kejriwal has been in jail since March 21 and was granted bail for a short period to campaign for his party during the Lok Sabha elections held last month.The court, however, imposed conditions on the bail, including prohibiting him from hampering the investigation or influencing witnesses. Kejriwal has been instructed to appear before the court whenever required and to cooperate with the investigation.Special Judge Niyay Bindu issued the order after listening to arguments from both the prosecution and the defence counsel. On Wednesday, Kejriwal's judicial custody had been extended until July 3.The judge had reserved the order earlier in the day after hearing arguments from the ED, which sought to link Kejriwal to the alleged proceeds of crime and co-accused individuals. The defense argued that the prosecution lacked evidence to substantiate claims against the AAP leader.ED will now move Delhi high court on Friday morning against trial court's judgement in Arvind Kejriwal case.AAP leader Atishi commented ""Satyamev Jayate"" (truth alone triumphs) following the grant of bail.Kejriwal's arrest stemmed from allegations tied to financial irregularities in the excise policy, which led to a high-profile investigation by the ED. The case has drawn significant attention and sparked numerous political reactions.""We have faith in the court… Kejriwal gets bail… truth wins…,"" Punjab CM and AAP leader Bhagwant Mann wrote on X.""Truth can be troubled, but not defeated,"" said AAP.Delhi Minister and AAP leader Saurabh Bharadwaj said, ""Rouse Avenue court granting bail to CM Arvind Kejriwal is a milestone for the whole country. This decision will become a big example in our law system. In PMLA, most people get relief only from the Supreme Court. Usually, lower courts never give relief. So it is evident that the central govt has no proof in this case.""AAP national spokesperson Priyanka Kakkar said, ""This case is completely fake, the whole case has been written in the BJP office. We are very grateful to the court for giving a historic decision. Regular bail in a PMLA case is nothing less than an acquittal.""",The court also declined Enforcement Directorate (ED) prayer to stay the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader's bail order for 48 hours.

Ajay Rai

is elated over INDIA bloc’s performance in the state. He himself put up a brave front while contesting against

Prime Minister Narendra Modi

in Varanasi where the PM’s victory margin substantially dipped from 4.79 lakh in 2019 to 1.52 lakh votes against Rai this time. In conversation with

Shailvee Sharda





What are the key takeaways from the Lok Sabha election?





How do you see your party’s performance in UP?





Constitution or caste – which was been the bigger force that acted as a multiplier for INDIA bloc?





Different surveys have come up indicating that Dalits have voted for the INDIA bloc. Do you agree?





What worked in favour of the Congress?





Why do you say that Ram and ration did not resonate with voters?





SP-Congress alliance has worked well so far. What next?





Rahul Gandhi has said that Priyanka could have defeated PM Modi from Varanasi. Your take?





Do you think you could have done better in Varanasi?

, Rai said that people rejected the politics of polarisation and voted for the country. Excerpts:Lok Sabha elections proved that even Prime Minister Narendra Modi is not invincible, and that people of India hold the supreme power. It has been established that those who cannot ensure public interest and welfare will get a thumbs down from voters. People have rejected the politics of hatred and foiled all efforts of the BJP to polarize elections. It appears people resorted to strategic voting in many seats and voted for the nation.We did well. Winning six out of 17 seats is a good strike rate but the number could have been higher. We have been made to lose on certain seats. Bansgaon is an example where a candidate lost by a margin of 3,150 votes. Similarly, in Deoria, Maharajganj, Kanpur and Amroha our candidates did well in many rounds, but the BJP candidate took the lead in the final round. Had the elections been fair, the Congress tally would have been 10. Despite this, we have gained as the hard work put in by the party since 2019 to strengthen the organization has finally paid dividends. The results have energized our cadre.Constitution, for sure. People from all walks of life – SC, ST, Dalits, Muslims, OBCs, women and youth – supported the cause. The Constitution is the core of our existence as an Indian. People feared that the Modi govt would change the Constitution and the anxiety deepened when BJP candidates, MPs, MLAs reiterated this to polarize the election. INDIA bloc and Rahul Gandhi offered hope to the people and their faith shaped the election outcome.Not just Dalits, people across caste lines have reposed faith in us. In Varanasi, Sonkars – who are said to be the traditional vote bank of BJP – have voted for me. Pasis and Kurmis voted for us in various constituencies. The economy has been affected by BJP’s faulty policies. Instead of taking remedial measures, BJP distracted people.BJP workers and committed RSS cadre did not venture out to campaign as they did not want to face the people. I think the workers had been failed by the leadership. Promises were not fulfilled, jobs were not created, and the people’s problems were not solved. In Varanasi, workers were sidelined, and all work was carried out by event management companies which relied on hired workforce.Hindus are religious and hold a personal bond with their deity. Both PM Modi and the BJP commercialized faith. The ration given by the BJP may have been a good act, but they started taking credit for it and used it to bargain for votes. This hurt the self-respect of the people.We will continue to work together. The leadership would devise a strategy for upcoming byelections and the future course of action.Absolutely true. Even I had urged ‘Didi’ to contest from Varanasi even before the election was notified.There is always room for improvement but I am satisfied that we all fought with full might despite limited resources. They had the backing of ‘businessmen friends’, govt machinery, corporates and an army of governors and CMs holding meetings. Modiji may have won the seat, but I have been able to earn the love of the people of Varanasi known for their largesse and straightforwardness, thanks to the blessings of Baba Vishwanath.","Ajay Rai says people rejected the politics of polarisation and voted for the country.

The other three requests seek checking of EVM chips across 26 select polling stations of Gajapathinagaram AC and Ongole AC in Andhra Pradesh and Jharsuguda AC in Odisha. The PCs with the most polling stations selected for EVM check are Ahmednagar PC (40); Virudhunagar PC and Zahirabad PC (20 each); Jharsuguda AC (13) and Ongole AC (12).Interestingly the verification was sought not only for the closely contested seats with thin victory margins but also where margins exceeded 2 lakh votes. For instance, the margin was 2.49 lakh in Vizianagaram PC, 2.32 lakh in Karnal PC from where Union minister Manohar Lal was elected; 1.73 lakh in Faridabad PC; and 2.16 lakh in Vellore PC. In Kanker PC, the narrow margin of 1,884 votes seems to have prompted defeated Congress candidate Biresh Thakur to seek EVM chip verification; as in Jharsuguda AC where the BJD candidate Dipali Das lost to BJP rival by 1,333 votes; and Virudhunagar PC where the Congress opponent defeated DMDK candidate by 4,379 votes.

Election petition filing deadline being July 19, 2024, the technical SOP enumerating the methodology and steps for verification of EVM microcontrollers will be issued by EC in the four weeks after that.EC on Thursday said the manufacturers will issue schedule EVM checking within two weeks of receipt of election petition (EP) status from CEOs, and the same will start within four weeks of confirmation of EP status.",The Election Commission has received a total of 11 applications from candidates defeated in the recent Lok Sabha and assembly polls.

Shehzad Poonawalla criticizes Congress over Priyanka Gandhi's candidacy in Wayanad,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shehzad-poonawalla-criticizes-congress-over-priyanka-gandhis-candidacy-in-wayanad/articleshow/111064900.cms,"NEW DELHI: Congress MP Rahul Gandhi 's decision to retain Rae Bareli seat in Uttar Pradesh prompting his sister, Priyanka Gandhi , to contest the bypolls for the Wayanad seat in Kerala sparked criticism from BJP leader Shehzad Poonawala, who accused the Congress party of operating as a 'family business.'Poonawalla on Monday said, ""Congress is not a party but a family business, and this has been proved today. The mother has entered the Rajya Sabha, the son has entered the Lok Sabha from one seat, and Priyanka Gandhi has been made a member from another Lok Sabha seat. All three members of the family will be in the Parliament."" He further claimed that Rahul Gandhi, despite his win in Rae Bareli, is dependent on the Samajwadi Party's support and is unwilling to risk a by-election, which he believes could jeopardize a second victory.Poonawalla also criticized Rahul Gandhi's move to Wayanad, asserting that it was a betrayal to the people of the constituency. ""Annie Raja kept saying that Rahul Gandhi would move out of the state after the elections, which he did,"" he said, adding, ""Another thing has become very clear: the political legacy of the family will be with the son and not the daughter.""Earlier today, Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge announced that Rahul Gandhi would continue to represent Rae Bareli in the 18th Lok Sabha, while Priyanka Gandhi would contest from Wayanad. Kharge said that, ""Rahul Gandhi was elected from two seats. As per rules, he will have to vacate one seat and continue on one seat. Since June 18 is the last date, we have decided that Rahul should keep his Rae Bareli seat, since it has been very close to the family for a long time. He has received love from the people of Wayanad, and people there want him to retain the seat, but the rules do not allow it. So, after a lot of deliberations, we decided that Priyanka Gandhi should contest from Wayanad, and she has agreed.""Expressing her enthusiasm for the first electoral contest Priyanaka Gandhi said, ""I am very happy to be able to represent Wayanad. All I can say is that I won't let them feel his absence. As Rahul said, he will come many times with me, but I will work hard, and I will try to make everyone happy and be a good representative. I have a special connection with Rae Bareli. I have worked for 20 years in both Rae Bareli and Amethi.""Rahul Gandhi on reatining the Rae Bareli sear said that he had an emotional connection with both Rae Bareli and Wayanad. ""I was the Wayanad MP for the last five years, and the people of Wayanad gave me love, for which I thank them. Priyanka will contest from Wayanad, but I will continue to visit Wayanad, and the promises we made to Wayanad will be fulfilled. I have a long relationship with Rae Bareli, and I am very happy that I will be representing it. This was not an easy decision because my affection is with both,"" he added.(With inputs from agencies)","Congress MP Rahul Gandhi's decision to retain Rae Bareli seat in Uttar Pradesh prompting his sister, Priyanka Gandhi, to contest the bypolls for the Wayanad seat in Kerala.

"It is said PM stopped Ukraine-Russia war but ...': Rahul Gandhi takes jab at PM Modi over NEET, UGC-NET paper leaks",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/it-is-said-pm-stopped-ukraine-russia-war-but-rahul-gandhi-takes-jab-at-pm-modi-over-neet-ugc-net-paper-leaks/articleshow/111137555.cms,"PM has psychologically collapsed: Rahul



Education system captured by BJP's parent outfit: Rahul

Rahul takes potshots at PM



No one afraid of PM Modi now, says Rahul



NEW DELHI: Congress MP Rahul Gandhi on Thursday launched a fierce attack against the BJP-led government over alleged leak of NEET and UGC-NET exam papers that has affected tens of thousands of students, stating that he will be raising the matter in the upcoming session of Parliament and put immense pressure on the Centre.""Now, people are clear that we are sitting on a disaster and we have a government that is crippled. It is a national crisis, it's an economic crisis, it's an educational crisis, institutional crisis. But I don't see any response. I don't see a capability of response (from the government),"" the MP said during a press conference.The Congress MP went on to say that the silence of the government is because ""the PM is crippled""""Right now, the PM's main agenda is the (election of) the Speaker. He is bothered about his government and Speaker ... The PM has psychologically collapsed and he will struggle to run a government like this. PM Modi 's idea of running govt is to generate fear in people. But now people are not scared of him. The basic concept of Modi has been destroyed in this election. If there were Vajpayee ji or Manmohan Singh ji, they might have been able to survive because they had humility, respect and conciliation. But Narendra Modi doesn't believe in all this.""""Enquiry is underway, one (UGC-NET) has been cancelled; we don't know whether the other (NEET) one will be cancelled or not. But, someone is responsible for all this and they should be arrested and action should be taken against them,"" he added.He also explained why there has been a rise in such paper leaks.""The reason behind paper leaks is that the education system has been captured by the BJP's parent organisation. Till the time this is not reversed, paper leaks and cancellation of exams will go on. PM Modi has facilitated this capture. It is an anti-national activity,"" said Rahul.Talking directly to the affected students, the MP said: ""Our vice-chancellors are placed not based on merit but because they belong to a particular organisation. And this organisation and the BJP have penetrated our education system and destroyed it. What was done by PM Modi to the economy with demonetisation, has now been done to the education system. The reason this is happening and the reason you're suffering is because an independent, objective education system has been demolished ... It is very important that the people who are guilty here are brought to book and they are punished.""He went on to take a potshot at the PM, stating: ""It was said that Narendra Modi stopped the Ukraine-Russia conflict, Israel-Gaza war but due to some reason, he is either not able to stop the paper leaks in the country or he doesn't want to stop them. The students end up suffering as this is their future. Vyapam took place in Madhya Pradesh, which is now being spread across the country by PM Modi and his government.""""Now nobody in the country is afraid of him (PM Modi). Earlier the chest was 56 inches, but now I cannot give the number, but it has become 30-32 ... His way of working is to scare people, to intimidate them, now that fear is gone. I don't know if you saw it or not but someone hit him with a 'chappal' in Varanasi. Before the elections, if someone wanted to hit him, there was fear, now that fear has ended. There are internal problems too, there are problems in their party, there are issues in their parent organisation. So I want to say that the concept of Narendra Modi has been demolished by the opposition, it has been finished ... There is a very strong opposition, so it is a very interesting time,"" he added.",Congress MP Rahul Gandhi launched a fierce attack against the BJP-led government over alleged leak of NEET and UGC-NET exam papers.
