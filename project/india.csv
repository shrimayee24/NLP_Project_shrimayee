'Crass politics': Shashi Tharoor's post on Uttar Pradesh irks BJP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/crass-politics-shashi-tharoors-post-on-uttar-pradesh-irks-bjp/articleshow/111206793.cms,"Shashi Tharoor's post on UP went viral. BJP reacts

CBI registers FIR in alleged NEET-UG paper leak case, say officials

NEW DELHI: Amid the ongoing controversy over the irregularities in national-level examinations and paper leaks, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor took a swipe at the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government with a “Uttar Pradesh kise kehte hain? (Define Uttar Pradesh .)” meme. The post, however, has drawn sharp criticism from the BJP accusing Tharoor of stereotyping the state.In a post on X, the Congress MP on Saturday shared a viral post, showing an image of an answer sheet with a question asking the students to 'define Uttar Pradesh'. And the answer: ""Wah pradesh jahan pariksha se pehle uttar ka pata chal jaaye, usse Uttar Pradesh kehte hai (The state where the answer is known before the exam is called Uttar Pradesh).""This post, however, didn't go well with the BJP and the senior Congress leader faced backlash.Responding to Shashi Tharoor's post, Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said, ""This gentleman frequently indulges in satirizing various cultures (first Northeast and now UP) with remarkably caustic words. He has succumbed to the beguiling whispers of lunacy, his mind adrift in the ethereal mists of derangement.""Meanwhile, Union minister Jitin Prasad said that Tharoor's remark is an insult to UP is deplorable and must be condemned.BJP spokesperson CR Kesavan called Tharoor a “repeat offender” and alleged that he had earlier insulted the people of the northeast by “ridiculing their traditional attire as outlandish.”“To belittle a serious issue, implying that the state of UP is a state of cheaters is indefensible and unpardonable. Splattering fancy English words does not necessarily make one civil and dignified,” he added.State minister AK Sharma also responded to Tharoor's post and said that after winning the election the 'dead Congress' even didn't thank people properly and had already insulted those who had voted for their party. He also highlighted some great leaders born in the UP.""Congress, which has insulted Uttar Pradesh in this manner, should apologise to the people of the state. Otherwise, the people here will take revenge from them. This mentality of Congress is highly condemnable,"" he added.Former Union minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar, who lost against Tharoor in the Thiruvananthapuram Lok Sabha seat, said, “Shameless crass politics of shaming other fellow Indians - thats the Congress way, ably demonstrated by this self-titled Global citizen.”Referring to the recent controversy around Sam Pitroda's description of Indian nationals from different parts of the country, he added, “Runs deep in the Cong DNA, this type of superiority complex.”BJP leader and Rajasthan minister Rajyavardhan Rathore said, “Shashi, you having to resort to frivolity!! And in doing so condemning people of an entire state? You don’t see UP as yours, since you are deriding it. When a person of your stature and intelligence mocks a State, why wouldn’t others do? And then what!!”The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has registered a First Information Report (FIR) regarding alleged irregularities in the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test for Undergraduate (NEET-UG) conducted on May 5, according to officials on Sunday. The agency is also taking measures to include cases filed by police in various states under its jurisdiction.This development follows the Centre's announcement on Saturday that the investigation into the alleged irregularities would be transferred to the CBI. The agency has initiated a new case against unidentified individuals under sections 120-B (criminal conspiracy) and 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), among others, based on a reference from the Union education ministry.The NEET-UG examination was conducted across 4,750 centers, with approximately 24 lakh candidates participating. The decision to hand over the probe to the CBI was made after a review, in response to demands from students protesting in several cities for an investigation into alleged malpractices during the examination.""Certain cases of alleged irregularities, cheating, impersonation and malpractice have been reported in NEET-UG which was conducted on May 5,"" a senior education ministry official said.""For transparency in the conduct of the examination process, it was decided after a review that the matter be handed over to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for a comprehensive investigation,"" the official added.Meanwhile, minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas of India Hardeep Singh Puri in his X post said, ""Seriously, Shashi Tharoor is this the level to which you wish to take this discourse? Uttar Pradesh is not only known for its contribution to our civilisation but has also produced innumerable literary luminaries, political stalwarts & achievers. Ironically, it is also home to the first family, to which all Congress leaders pay obeisance. Despite the privilege of having been educated at the best of institutions, I am surprised that you chose to stereotype, trivialise and caricature an entire state like this. Need for serious introspection, my friend.""","Congress MP Shashi Tharoor took a swipe at the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government with a “Uttar Pradesh kise kehte hain?

The apex court, which is scheduled to hear the matter on July 8, has not stopped the counselling process, but has not ruled out cancellation.

It is now clarified that the Irrigation Department has not given the clearance to hand over these two acres to the YSRCP,"" as mentioned in the TDP release.Earlier in the day, YSRCP chief YS Jagan Mohan Reddy claimed that the Chandrababu Naidu-led NDA state government had demolished the under-construction central office of the opposition party in Tadepalli,Guntur district , disregarding high court orders.""Chandrababu took vendetta politics to the next level.
