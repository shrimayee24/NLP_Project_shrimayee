Will take steps at right time: Mallikarjun Kharge after INDIA meeting,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-take-steps-at-right-time-mallikarjun-kharge-after-india-meeting/articleshow/110751234.cms,"NEW DELHI: On the day BJP and allies sealed the deal to form the next govt, the opposition said it will take “appropriate steps” in the future to “realise the people’s desire not to be ruled by the BJP govt”, in a clear bid to create uncertainty about the coming NDA regime in which the BJP will depend on the allies to make the numbers. The opposition dubbed the Modi rule as “fascist”.Stalwarts of the INDIA bloc met Wednesday for over two hours to discuss the election results, with sources saying that most of the parties expressed the wish to form the govt but conceded that it was difficult to stop the BJP now that it has stitched the alliances.Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge told reporters that “people’s mandate has given a befitting reply to BJP and its politics of hate, corruption and deprivation”. He said the mandate is “in defence of the Constitution of India and against price rise, unemployment and crony capitalism, and also to save democracy.” He assured that the INDIA bloc will continue to fight against the “fascist rule” of BJP led by Modi.“We will take appropriate steps at the appropriate time to realise the people’s desire not to be ruled by the BJP govt. This is our decision that whatever promises we have made to the people, we will keep,” Kharge said, flanked by opposition biggies including Sonia Gandhi, Sharad Pawar, Rahul Gandhi, M K Stalin, Akhilesh Yadav, Abhishek Banerjee, Sitaram Yechury, Tejashwi Yadav, Dipankar Bhattacharya, among others.In what sounded like an invite to BJP allies to defect, Kharge said, “INDIA alliance welcomes all parties which share its fundamental commitment to the values enshrined in the Preamble to our Constitution and to its many provisions for economic, social and political justice.”The post-meeting photo op and remarks showed that the opposition believes it is not possible to stake claim after falling short of the ruling NDA despite a good performance. But the feeling among the allies is that running a coalition would test Modi because of his “dictatorial attitude”, and his hard agenda and the desire for absolute control can repel partners. “There can be realignment in the future. That is the meaning of the statement about ‘taking appropriate steps at an appropriate time’,” senior participants in the meeting explained.Sources said Pawar, who is seen as the best exponent in power games, explained the situation and advised “let us wait and watch the political developments”. The same view was offered by the Congress brass.The meeting was attended by N K Premachandran (RSP), Dipankar Bhattacharya (CPI-ML), Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Sanjay Singh and Raghav Chadha (AAP), T R Baalu (DMK), Supriya Sule (NCP), Arvind Sawant and Sanjay Raut (ShIv Sena), Sitaram Yechuri (CPM) and D Raja (CPI), among others.Concern was also expressed that BJP govt could resume its “weaponising of agencies” and “breaking of parties” once it is back in saddle. The apprehension of harassment of opposition parties was expressed by more than one leader, sources said.Sources said the meeting also lauded the performance in UP, West Bengal and Maharashtra, which severely dented the BJP tally. However, there was lament about the relatively low performance in Jharkhand, Bihar and some other states. Members suggested that steps should be taken to make INDIA bloc more dynamic.",BJP and allies sealed the deal to form the next govt.

Maratha quota stir singes NDA in over half-dozen Marathwada seats,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maratha-quota-stir-singes-nda-in-over-half-dozen-marathwada-seats/articleshow/110750202.cms,"CHHATRAPATI SAMBHAJINAGAR : Soon after the battle for Beed LS constituency ended late Wednesday, the opposition NCP (SCP) candidate Bajrang Sonawane , who defeated BJP’s Pankaja Munde — sister of sitting MP Pritam Munde — by a thin margin of 6,553 votes, headed to Antarvali Sarati village in Jalna district and met Maratha quota activist Manoj Jarange at 2am. “Dada, you made me an MP,” Sonawane said touching Jarange’s feet.The Maratha reservation agitation , which has kept Maharashtra’s politicians on their toes for several months now, is believed to have played a big role in the loss of BJP-led front’s candidates in Marathwada constituencies such as Beed, Parbhani, Jalna, Nanded, Hingoli and Osmanabad. The alliance lost seven of the eight seats here. Even in western and northern Maharashtra, the agitation affected the poll results.It was most visible in Parbhani and Beed, where the opposition fielded Maratha candidates to take on NDA’s OBC nominees.In Jalna, the epicentre of the agitation, Union minister Raosaheb Danve, who won by a margin of over 3 lakh votes in 2019, lost this time by over one lakh votes to Congress.In Nanded, where BJP’s RS member Ashok Chavan was heading the poll campaign for Pratap Chikhalikar, the ex-CM met with stiff resistance from quota supporters. And Vasant Chavan of Congress clinched the seat from BJP by over 59,000 votes — here Ashok Chavan had won as Congress candidate in 2014 amid a Modi wave.Across Marathwada, Aurangabad was the only bright spot for NDA. Here, Shiv Sena candidate Sandipan Bhumare, who is believed to have a rapport with Jarange, won by over 1.3 lakh votes.In western Maharashtra, Maratha voters shifted from BJP to MVA in Solapur and Madha after backing the saffron party’s candidates in the last two general elections.In Solapur, Congress candidate and winner Praniti Shinde — her father ex-Union minister Sushil Kumar Shinde lost here by over 1.5 lakh votes in 2019 — gained in rural Solapur mainly because of the consolidation of Maratha votes. Jarange had held public meetings in Solapur. It was the same in Madha where Dhairyasheel Mohite Patil of NCP (SCP) gained.The Maratha agitation, however, had no effect in Satara, Sangli, Kolhapur and Hatkanangle seats.In north Maharashtra, Nana Bachhav, a member of the Sakal Maratha Samaj Nashik, said: “All the sitting members, especially those of BJP, have been defeated and the community has supported others. We were told that we would get the reservation under the OBC category. But state govt failed to enact any law.” Bachhav said the defeat of the sitting MPs in Nashik and Ahmednagar was an example of how the Jarange factor played out.While Jarange played down Sonawane’s visit, saying “different politicians meet me”, he warned: “We will not remain silent till we get our reservation. We will fight in all 288 assembly seats in the upcoming state elections by teaming up with people from other castes.”","The Maratha reservation agitation is believed to have played a big role in the loss of BJP-led front’s candidates in Marathwada constituencies such as Beed, Parbhani, Jalna, Nanded, Hingoli and Osmanabad.

The remaining seat was won by the Congress.Naveen Patnaik made an unexpected entry into state politics through the BJD, a party named after his father, former Odisha CM Biju Patnaik. His political career began with a victory in the 1998 Lok Sabha bypoll, representing his father's constituency of Aska. Following the BJD's success in the 2000 Assembly elections, where they formed a coalition with the BJP and gained a majority, Patnaik resigned from his position in the Union cabinet to become Chief Minister.Since then, Patnaik had been the second longest-serving chief minister in India, after former Sikkim CM Pawan Kumar Chamling.Patnaik had for the first time taken oath as the chief minister of Odisha on March 5, 2000.","The Biju Janata Dal, which has governed Odisha since 1997, lost to the BJP.

RANCHI: In Jharkhand, the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance secured nine out of the 14 seats, with the BJP winning eight and its alliance partner, the Ajsu Party , retaining its single seat. This outcome mirrors the nationwide decline in the appeal of Modi's leadership. On the other hand, the India bloc demonstrated an improved performance, increasing its seat count from two in 2019 to five in the current election.The results in Jharkhand highlight the shifting political landscape, with the BJP's dominance facing challenges from opposition parties. The India bloc's gains suggest a growing support base and a potential shift in voter preferences. As the nation witnesses a change in the political dynamics, it remains to be seen how these developments will shape the future course of governance and policy-making in the state and beyond.The India bloc has secured all the tribal reserved seats in the recent elections. According to analysts, the Enforcement Directorate's actions against Hemant Soren, the working president of the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and former chief minister, were not well-received by the tribal voters.The JMM emerged victorious in Dumka, Singhbhum, and Rajmahal seats, successfully capitalizing on the tribal sentiment. This sentiment was fueled by the BJP-led central government's refusal to include a separate sarna code in the census register, which is a matter of identity for the tribal community.In an attempt to win the Dumka seat, the BJP had nominated Sita Soren, the elder daughter-in-law of Guruji. However, she was defeated by JMM's Nalin Soren, who secured a margin of 22,527 votes.","In Jharkhand, the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance secured nine out of the 14 seats.

Modi is likely to call on President Droupadi Murmu on Friday evening to submit letters of support from NDA constituents.The impetus for early swearing-in came from NDA partners at the meeting of the alliance. “Modi played a major role in our historic Andhra victory, should take over the reins of the govt without delay. He has the full support of all of us,” a source quoted TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu as saying in the meeting.JD(U) president and Bihar CM Nitish Kumar articulated the same sentiment and wondered why the matter was being delayed. “Instead of holding discussions, he should have been elected leader straightaway,” Kumar said, according to sources.NCP’s Praful Patel also spoke along the same lines. “Our numbers may have come down but there is no mistaking your overwhelming popularity. Majority of people see you as best suited to be PM,” the Rajya Sabha MP said.The drill for Modi’s record-equalling third swearing-in got underway on Wednesday with the Union cabinet recommending the dissolution of Lok Sabha. Chief election commissioner Rajeev Kumar, along with election commissioners Gyanesh Kumar and S S Sandhu, will call on the President with the list of newly-elected MPs.Rashtrapati Bhavan is closed for the public until Sunday, in what is being seen as part of preparations for the swearing-in ceremony.The NDA meeting was held amid growing buzz about Naidu staking claim to important infrastructure-related ministries besides demanding the position of Speaker as a pre-condition for pledging the support of his 16 MPs to Modi. Some political circles also maintained that Naidu had asked for a common minimum programme and appointment of an NDA convener for better coordination among partners. Sources, however, denied any muscle flexing.The meeting of the 28 NDA partners also saw JD(S) leader H D Kumaraswamy, Jayant Chaudhary of RLD, Sudesh Mahto (AJSU) and Anupriya Patel (Apna Dal) saying the PM’s popularity was crucial to NDA getting a majority after a decade in office. Patel said the UP numbers dipped because of the opposition’s false propaganda that NDA would change the Constitution. “We could not counter it in time but that is something to be addressed later,” a source quoted Patel, minister of state in the outgoing govt, as saying.Besides Modi, those present in the meeting included his senior BJP colleagues Amit Shah, Rajnath Singh and J P Nadda, Maharashtra CM Eknath Shinde of Shiv Sena, LJP’s Chirag Paswan, Jitan Ram Manjhi, JSP’s Pawan Kalyan, Sunil Tatkare (NCP), Rajiv Ranjan Singh and Sanjay Jha (JDU).In its resolution, the alliance said the NDA govt will continue working to lift people’s living standards for the country’s all-round development while conserving its heritage. “We are all proud that NDA fought the 2024 Lok Sabha polls unitedly under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi and won. We all NDA leaders unanimously elect Narendra Modi as our leader,” it added.The resolution said people had seen the country being developed in every sector in the last 10 years due to the pro-people policies of the NDA govt under Modi. It acknowledged “the nation's choice of robust leadership for the third consecutive term”.",Narendra Modi was unanimously elected leader of the National Democratic Alliance on Wednesday.

Rahul cashes in on Modi’s absence to sweep Manipur,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rahul-cashes-in-on-modis-absence-to-sweep-manipur/articleshow/110748306.cms,"GUWAHATI: The year-long ethnic conflict in the heart of India’s northeastern region, Manipur , deeply affected its multi-ethnic groups, resulting in the collective mandate of these communities going against NDA as the conflict significantly impacted their lives and changed the political dynamics in the Lok Sabha elections.Kukis, Meiteis, Nagas and Muslims, who historically coexisted in a blend of harmony and tension, overwhelmingly voted in favour of Congress, which won the two Lok Sabha seats, defeating BJP in Inner Manipur in the valley and NPF in the hills.Analysts say the continuation of the ethnic conflict, albeit sporadically, coupled with perceived negligence from the Centre, fuelled widespread discontent.The newly elected 50-year-old Outer Manipur MP, Arthur, said he got maximum votes from all communities, “be it from Muslims, Nagas, Meiteis and Kukis”.Arthur, a singer-turned-journalist-turned-politician, attributed it to people’s understanding “what is reality and the fiction that was sold by BJP. I guess people are informed and they voted for a party that lives in reality”. Inner Manipur winner, 57-year-old JNU assistant professor Akoijam cautioned: “It’s a clear message, don’t take people of this state for granted.” A significant point of contention has been Prime MinisterNarendra Modi ’s absence from the state during these trying times. This absence was perceived not merely as a physical absence but as a symbolic neglect of the state’s dire need for attention and intervention from the highest levels of government. In stark contrast, Rahul Gandhi made two visits to Manipur amidst the ongoing ethnic conflict. He met Meities, Kukis, Nagas and Muslims. His presence in Manipur, and his engagement with the issues faced by its people, offered what many in the state felt was sorely lacking from the central leadership.These visits were not just political manoeuvres but were seen as gestures of solidarity and acknowledgment of the state’s plight.BJP also sent Amit Shah twice. Once for assessment of the deepening conflict and holding meetings with stakeholders and on the other occasion to campaign for the party. This distinction between the actions of Rahul and Shah became a focal point in the polls, with the electorate viewing Rahul visits as an embodiment of the concern and involvement they year-ned for. The turning point was Rahul’s Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra that started from Manipur’s Thoubal in Jan.","Kukis, Meiteis, Nagas and Muslims, who historically coexisted in a blend of harmony and tension, overwhelmingly voted in favour of Congress.

NEW DELHI: The NDA members on Wednesday unanimously elected Prime Minister Narendra Modi as their leader during a key meeting in Delhi. The NDA parties, including TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu and JDU's Nitish Kumar, signed the resolution to elect PM Modi as the alliance leader. The NDA MPs are set to meet again on June 7 to formally elect PM Modi as their leader, after which they will submit their letters of support to the President.The new government is expected to be sworn in over the weekend, with efforts being made to expedite the formalities and prevent any uncertainty that the opposition may seek to exploit.Meanwhile, TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu and JD(U) leader Nitish Kumar dismissed suggestions of defecting to the opposition and reaffirmed their commitment to the NDA.On the other hand, the INDIA bloc also held a meeting where they resolved to continue their fight against the BJP's rule and take appropriate steps ""to realize the people's desire not to be ruled by the BJP government"". Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge also invited parties sharing a commitment to the Constitution's values to join the INDIA bloc.Besides, President Droupadi Murmu dissolved the 17th Lok Sabha after the recommendation of the Union cabinet.These developments came after the BJP emerged as the largest party in the recently concluded Lok Sabha elections, securing 240 seats, while the Congress came in second with 99 seats.The NDA alliance, which includes the BJP and its partners, has a majority with 293 seats, surpassing the halfway mark. The opposition alliance secured 234 seats.Although the BJP fell short of a majority on its own, it is likely to form the government with the support of its allies.The TDP and JD(U), which won 16 and 12 seats respectively in Andhra Pradesh and Bihar, have dismissed suggestions of defecting to the opposition. However, sources indicate that the Congress and other opposition parties are attempting to woo these allies.Prime Minister Narendra Modi presided over a meeting of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance's members on Wednesday, as he prepares to take the oath for a third consecutive term as the head of a coalition government. The NDA members unanimously elected him as their leader during the meeting.According to HAM (Secular) leader and former Bihar chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi, NDA MPs will convene on June 7 to formally elect Modi as their leader, and the alliance leaders will then submit their letters of support to the President. Some sources suggest that the new government is likely to be sworn in on June 8.The timing of the swearing-in ceremony may also depend on how quickly the BJP and its allies can reach an agreement on matters such as the distribution of ministries among the parties and other terms of negotiations. Alternatively, they could postpone the resolution of these tricky issues to a later stage.The meeting was attended by 21 leaders from 16 parties, including TDP leader N Chandrababu Naidu, Bihar CM Nitish Kumar, Maharashtra CM Eknath Shinde, LJP(R) leader Chirag Paswan, JD(S) leader H D Kumarawamy, Jana Sena's Pawan Kalyan, AGP's Atul Bora, and NCP's Praful Patel, in addition to Modi and BJP's Amit Shah, Rajnath Singh, and J P Nadda.JDU national spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan dismissed rumors about Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar joining the INDIA bloc after the Lok Sabha results. In a press statement issued by the party, Ranjan said that despite investing heavily in various manipulations and false propaganda, the INDIA bloc leaders have lost their mental balance after facing defeat in the elections for the third consecutive time.""The false propaganda about Nitish Kumar is a result of their frustration. They should know that the unity of the NDA is as strong as a rock,"" Ranjan said.""On one side were those eager to maintain their family dominance, and on the other were leaders like Namo-Nitish who care about the nation's interests. Even though our seats have slightly decreased, by defeating the dynastic parties for the third consecutive time, the people have shown that the days of dynastic rule are over. The public stands with democracy and development,"" the statement read in Hindi.After attending the NDA meeting to discuss the formation of the new government, TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu confirmed that the TDP is aligned with the NDA. He posed the question, ""How can we contest elections collectively if we are not part of the NDA?"", stressing the importance of being part of the alliance.Naidu described the meeting with BJP's top leadership as positive. When asked about the TDP's role in the NDA, he reiterated, ""How can we contest elections if we are not a part of the NDA? We fought this collectively.""The presence of Naidu and Nitish Kumar at the NDA meeting holds significant importance, as their parties' support is crucial for the BJP to form the government. This time, the BJP fell 32 seats short of the majority mark of 272 and will need to rely on its allies to form a government.In a statement following the INDIA bloc's first meeting, parallel to the NDA in Delhi after the Lok Sabha poll results, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge announced that the alliance partners would take necessary actions at the appropriate moment to fulfill the public's desire not to be governed by the BJP.The nearly two-hour meeting concluded with the leaders resolving to persist in their struggle against the BJP's ""fascist rule"" led by Narendra Modi, while expressing gratitude to the people for their immense support to the INDIA bloc.Kharge, reading from a statement adopted unanimously by all alliance members, said, ""We will take appropriate steps at the appropriate time to realise people's desire not to be ruled by the BJP's government."" He emphasised that this decision was made collectively by all INDIA bloc constituents.The Congress president had called the meeting to assess the political landscape and election outcomes, and to explore the possibility of forming a government and reaching out to former partners Nitish Kumar and Chandrababu Naidu. Kharge also affirmed that the opposition would continue to collaborate and stand by the commitments made to the people.Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge extended an invitation to all parties that uphold the principles outlined in the Constitution's Preamble to join the INDIA bloc during the opposition grouping's first meeting following its commendable performance in the Lok Sabha elections.Kharge commended the INDIA bloc partners for their united and resolute efforts in the polls. He emphasised that the election results indicated a rejection of Prime Minister Modi's politics, both in substance and style, marking a significant political and moral defeat for him. However, Kharge accused Modi of attempting to undermine the will of the people.""The INDIA alliance welcomes all parties which share its fundamental commitment to the values enshrined in the Preamble to our Constitution and to its many provisions for economic, social and political justice,"" Kharge said reaffirming the bloc's commitment to the Constitution's principles.PM Modi submitted his resignation, along with that of the council of ministers, to President Droupadi Murmu. The President accepted the resignations and requested the Prime Minister and the council of ministers to continue in their roles until the formation of the new government.Earlier in the morning, the Union Cabinet convened its final meeting at the Prime Minister's residence, during which a proposal was approved for the dissolution of the 17th Lok Sabha. This development follows the Lok Sabha election results announced on the previous day, which granted a clear majority to the BJP-led NDA, securing nearly 295 seats and setting the stage for the next government formation.President Droupadi Murmu organized a dinner at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, inviting PM Modi and the outgoing council of ministers. Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar and Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla were also present at the event.The President's office shared the news on 'X', saying, ""President Droupadi Murmu hosted a dinner for the outgoing Union Council of Ministers, led by Prime Minister @narendramodi, at Rashtrapati Bhavan.""Earlier in the day, two photos of Bihar rivals Nitish Kumar and Tejashwi Yadav went viral in which they were seen traveling in the same plane. Both the leaders were on their way to Delhi to attend meetings of the NDA and the INDIA bloc respectively. What caught people's attention on social media was how in the first pic the leaders were seen sitting in different rows (Tejashwi behind Nitish) and in the second photo, they sat together. The pics sent people into a frenzy as it led to the wild speculation of Nitish coming around to the INDIA bloc.Later, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav shared what went on the plane and the story behind the viral pictures. According to Yadav, the two leaders exchanged greetings, and Kumar invited him to sit together despite Yadav being assigned a seat behind him. ""We greeted each other, I was allotted the seat behind him but he saw me and called me to sit with him,"" Tejashwi said.As the NDA and INDIA bloc leaders converged in Delhi for their respective meetings, prominent figures such as Nitish Kumar and N Chandrababu Naidu from the NDA, along with Tejashwi Yadav from the RJD, found themselves on the same plane.After the BJP's Lok Sabha seats in Maharashtra dropped from 23 to 9, deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis offered to resign from his post today. He expressed his desire to work ""full time"" for the party in preparation for the upcoming assembly elections.Fadnavis took responsibility for the BJP's performance in Maharashtra and requested the party leadership to relieve him of his duties in the government. He acknowledged his shortcomings and pledged to overcome them. The assembly elections in the state are scheduled to take place within the next six months.Meanwhile, CM Shinde said,""Electoral defeat is a collective responsibility. All three parties had worked together in the elections. If you look at the vote share, Mahayuti got more than two lakh votes in Mumbai. The reasons for the defeat will be honestly reviewed.""""In the last two years, the government has made many good decisions in the state. I will be speaking to Devendra ji soon. We have worked together in the past and we will keep on working in the future. We have collectively failed to counter the false claims of the opposition,"" he added.The Congress, meanwhile, criticized Fadnavis' offer to resign, calling it a ""drama"" and suggesting that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should be the one to quit. State Congress spokesperson Atul Londhe accused Fadnavis of running an ""unconstitutional government"" and publicly admitting to breaking up two parties to return to power.US President Joe Biden, Russian President Vladimir Putin, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, and French President Emmanuel Macron were among the numerous world leaders who extended their congratulations to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the victory of the BJP-led NDA coalition in the general elections. They expressed their eagerness to collaborate closely with him in the future.In his congratulatory message, Biden said, ""Congratulations to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the National Democratic Alliance on their victory, and the nearly 650 million voters in this historic election. The friendship between our nations is only growing as we unlock a shared future of unlimited potential.""During a phone call, President Putin conveyed his warm congratulations to Modi on his party's electoral success, acknowledging the support for the Indian leadership's political course and the country's socio-economic development and growing international influence. Both leaders expressed satisfaction with the current state of the Russian-Indian special and privileged strategic partnership and agreed to continue expanding it in all areas.British Prime Minister Sunak spoke to PM Modi and congratulated him on his election victory, emphasizing the close friendship between the UK and India. French President Macron noted the conclusion of the world's largest elections and expressed his desire to continue strengthening the strategic partnership between India and France.Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed, Taiwan President Lai Ching-te, and Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning also congratulated Modi on his victory. They highlighted the significance of India's role in global affairs and expressed their willingness to work together to advance bilateral ties and contribute to peace and prosperity.Leaders from Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Mauritius, Maldives, Bhutan, Barbados, Jamaica, Lithuania, and Kenya also extended their congratulations to Modi and the BJP-led NDA coalition. They emphasised the importance of strengthening bilateral relationships and working closely with India to achieve shared goals and overcome challenges.","The NDA parties, including TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu and JDU's Nitish Kumar, signed the resolution to elect PM Modi as the alliance leader.

The victory of these two independent candidates came in the 40th anniversary week of 1984’s Operation Bluestar at the Golden Temple that had led to Indira Gandhi ’s assassination that Oct and a Sikh massacre in Delhi that Nov.Life changed for six-year-old Sarabjit when his father Beant Singh, a Delhi police SI who was part of the PM’s security detail, along with another of her bodyguards, Satwant Singh, assassinated Indira Gandhi in Oct 1984. The rest of the PM’s security killed Singh and the Sikh community later declared him a ‘qaumi shaheed (martyr of community).’Sarabjit recalls that his family had seen times when it had no money even to pay his school fees. “My father didn’t care for the family and laid down his life...

That brought a procession of Sikh preachers, ragis, and dhadis to his campaign and changed Faridkot’s opinion.Soon, his campaign became a Sikh movement for repaying the “debt” owed to his father for “avenging” 1984’s terrorist-flush-out military raid on Harmandir Sahib, holiest of the faith’s shrines.“Now that I have won, my priority will be to raise my voice in Parliament to ensure legally there is provision of death penalty for the heinous crime of sacrilege... we will field Panthic candidates in byelections and upcoming SGPC election,” he said.","Sarabjit Singh Khalsa won the Faridkot parliamentary seat.

Clamour grows in Congress for Rahul to take over as LoP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/clamour-grows-in-congress-for-rahul-to-take-over-as-lop/articleshow/110747135.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amid elation in the Congress camp over its performance in the Lok Sabha elections, there is a growing desire in the party that Rahul Gandhi take up the post of leader of opposition in Lok Sabha and lead the party from the front in Parliament.Congress failed to get the top opposition perch after it fell short of numbers in 2014 and 2019 (54 MPs) which would automatically qualify it for the LoP’s post. Mallikarjun Kharge , who is now the Congress president, served as the “party leader in the Lok Sabha” in the first Modi govt, while Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury succeeded him in the last Parliament. With party strength now at 99 excluding two rebels, party members want him to take up the position.While Congress netas were eager that the Gandhi scion became the face in the LS after the party’s ouster from government in 2014, Rahul repeatedly refused to accede to their entreaties.However, some feel the situation has changed with Mandate 2024, given that the party has the numbers to get the official position of LoP, which comes with its own perks and status.Besides, Rahul has in the past few years become the political front representing the opposition against Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s BJP, which only makes it natural for him to be the LoP.Also, ten years in the opposition have exhausted all options of replacements, and it is time for Congress’ de facto leader to use the Parliament pulpit for positioning the party and the opposition for coming political battles, it is felt.A reason claimed earlier was that Rahul was disinclined to be the “leader in LS” because he was the party president, and did not want two responsibilities which come with attendant routine work. However, this Parliament would start without Rahul being the Congress chief — the post that he took over in 2017 and relinquished after the 2019 LS debacle.“We want him to be the LoP. But there has not been any discussion on it yet. However, this is the feeling in the party,” a key functionary said.Another crucial decision that Rahul has to take soon is the seat he should quit from LS — Rae Bareli or Wayanad.","Congress failed to get the top opposition perch after it fell short of numbers in 2014 and 2019.

"Success and setbacks part of game, PM tells ministers",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/success-and-setbacks-part-of-game-pm-tells-ministers/articleshow/110746790.cms,"NEW DELHI: “Success and setbacks are part of the game and if we are in politics , we should take setbacks in our stride. Small fluctuations should not deter us from continuing the good work we have done in the last 10 years,” PM Narendra Modi said at the last meeting of the Union cabinet , which recommended dissolution of the 17th Lok Sabha on Wednesday.The dip in numbers for the party and alliance, development work of the Modi govt since 2014 and India’s “improved” position in the global order were among the subjects discussed. The PM, who chaired the meeting at his residence, urged colleagues to gear up for the next five years to carry on from where the second BJP-led NDA govt had left off.Thereafter, the Union cabinet recommended the dissolution of Lok Sabha.

"Dharmendra Pradhan, CAG among Odisha CM contenders",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/dharmendra-pradhan-cag-among-odisha-cm-contenders/articleshow/110747332.cms,"BHUBANESWAR: BJP ’s Mission Odisha has moved on from breaching BJD’s fortress to racing the clock in search of someone matching the stature and influence of outgoing CM Naveen Patnaik to helm its first govt in the state. Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan , four-time MLA Mohan Majhi , and comptroller and auditor general Girish Murmu are seen as the main contenders for the chief ministership, reports Ashok Pradhan.BJP parliamentary board will take a call and is likely to announce its pick in the next two days, sources said. Pradhan is seen as potentially the strongest claimant because of his role in strategising for BJP in the past three elections.“As already announced by PM Modi, the CM will take the oath of office on June 10. Also, as promised, the CM will be a young Odia,” state BJP president Manmohan Samal said Wednesday. Samal, too, was a contender until he lost the contest for the Chandabali seat. Pradhan is credited with crafting BJP's state manifesto with ‘Odia asmita’ (pride) as a key poll theme, factors believed to have contributed to the party's leap from a lone Lok Sabha seat to 20. As an OBC figure, he also aligns with the caste dynamics of a state where more than 50% of the population are from backward groups. The one factor that may come in the way of Pradhan being chosen CM is BJP looking at utilising his electoral acumen nationally.","BJP parliamentary board will take a call and is likely to announce its pick in the next two days, sources said.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to take oath his third successive term on June 8.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) secured victory in the recent Lok Sabha elections, clinching 240 seats. However, this figure falls significantly short of the impressive 303 seats the party had won in the 2019 elections, meaning it has been unable to convert its vote share into seats this time.Several factors contributed to the loss of over 60 seats. The Samajwadi Party, led by Akhilesh Yadav, made substantial gains in Uttar Pradesh, a crucial state that had played a pivotal role in the Prime Minister's two previous victories. The Samajwadi Party emerged as the star performer of the Congress-led alliance, delivering its best-ever Lok Sabha performance. The BJP's seat count in the state fell from 64 in 2019 to 33, while the NDA's tally dropped to 34.In Maharashtra, the effective collaboration among Congress, Uddhav Thackeray, and Sharad Pawar resulted in a setback for the ruling party's performance. In West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee successfully defended her stronghold.The following is a state-wise breakdown of the election results:","Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to take oath on June 8.

"Samajwadi Party win mirrors Akhilesh’s PDA pitch: 86% MPs are OBCs, Dalits, Muslims",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sp-win-mirrors-akhileshs-pda-pitch-86-mps-are-obcs-dalits-muslims/articleshow/110748294.cms,"LUCKNOW: Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav ’s poll narrative of PDA (Pichhda, Dalit and Alpsankhyak) has come to reflect much more prominently with more than 86% of the party’s elected MPs in Uttar Pradesh coming from OBC , Dalit and Muslim background.SP ’s 37 MPs includes 20 from OBC, eight from SC and four from the Muslim community. Among the upper castes, only one MP each is from among Brahmins (Sanatan Pandey), Vaishya (Ruchi Veera) and Bhumihar (Rajeev Rai), while two are Thakur (Anand Bhadoria and Birendra Singh).In fact, it was only SP that experimented with the idea of fielding SC candidates from general seats like Meerut and Faizabad. SP’s Dalit candidate Awdhesh Prasad defeated BJP’s Lallu Singh from Faizabad by a margin of 54,567 votes. In Meerut, the party fielded Sunita Verma, a Dalit, who, however, lost to BJP’s Arun Govil by a slender margin of just over 10,500 votes. Verma is the former mayor of Meerut.SP ally Congress, which won six seats comprises one MP each from the OBC (Rakesh Rathor), SC (Tanuj Punia) and Muslim (Imran Masood) community. Of the other three, Rahul Gandhi is a Kashmiri Brahmin, Ujjwal Reoti Raman Singh is a Bhumihar and KL Sharma is a Punjabi.SP and Congress’s combined list of candidates included 33 from OBC, 19 from SC and six Muslims.At the other end, BJP’s list of MPs is dominated by upper castes, which have traditionally voted in favour of the saffron party since the peak of Ram temple movement that attained a countering overtone against Mandal politics.Data show that 15 out of 33 BJP MPs (eight Brahmins, five Thakur and two Vaishya) – or 45% of its winners– are from upper castes, which together make up for around 20% of the electorate. Of the rest, 10 are OBC and eight are SC – in what makes up for 55%. This is potentially less than the electoral numbers of OBC and SC, who taken together are well above 60% of the electorate.BJP allies like RLD and Apna Dal (S) saw election of three more OBC candidates – Rajkumar Sangwan (Jat) and Chandan Chauhan (Gurjar) in case of RLD and Apna Dal chief Anupriya Patel (Kurmi). But that changed the caste equations in the saffron camp only marginally.The caste matrices of BJP-led NDA and SP-Congress alliance draw a sharp parallel with the past. Data shows that of the five SP MPs in 2019, three were Muslims (Azam Khan, Shafiqur Rahman Barq and ST Hasan) while two were OBCs (party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav and Akhilesh). The party did not have a single MP from upper castes or the Dalit community.Likewise, out of BJP’s 62 MPs in 2019, 28 (12 Brahmins, 11 Thakur and five Vaishya/other) – making for 45% of the total – were from upper castes. The saffron list included 14 SCs and 20 OBCs (including Lodh, Jat and Gurjar), which made up for around 55% of its total MPs.","More than 86% of the party’s elected MPs in Uttar Pradesh come from OBC, Dalit and Muslim background.

Sitapur seat: Congress' last-minute candidate upsets veteran BJP leader in UP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/congresss-sitapur-victory-defines-bjps-fall-in-up/articleshow/110747366.cms,"NEW DELHI: Nearly 200km from Ayodhya lies Sitapur, connected to Sita and considered to be the heart of UP and BJP’s fort. Today, Sitapur defines BJP’s debacle in UP.Having failed to find any takers for the Sitapur seat and passing around the ticket between Samajwadi Party and Congress , it was left to Rajesh Rathore, an anonymous man whom the locals say has neither a name nor a recall value, to fight the elections for Congress. Rathore not only fought the elections, but he also defeated veteran Rajesh Verma, who had been winning the seat first for BSP and then for BJP, by 89,641 votes.It was a general expectation that after Ram temple consecration in Ayodhya in January, it would be almost impossible to defeat BJP. The perception of BJP’s invincibility was so strong that anyone who was offered a ticket either refused to accept it or returned it after accepting.Sitapur was first earmarked for SP and it wanted to field six-term former MLA Narendra Verma. But despite repeated attempts by Akhilesh Yadav, Verma did not relent and cited health reasons for refusing the ticket.Having failed to find a candidate, SP passed on the seat to Congress and it immediately nominated former BSP minister Nakul Dubey. But within four days, Dubey returned the ticket and Congress was left with a seat but no candidate to field.Observers said it was the fear of losing that made both Verma and Dubey refuse the ticket.Left with no choice, Congress finally approached Rathore, who immediately accepted the offer. Congress’s desperation was visible in their fielding of Rathore, as he comes from the lower OBC Teli community that hardly has any presence in Sitapur.To Rathore’s fortune, within days of his nomination there was a clear shift, with OBCs and dalits joining hands against BJP and moving towards INDIA bloc.Seeing the silent wave of OBCs and dalits moving towards INDIA bloc, Verma is said to have confided to his friends that he had “made the biggest blunder” of his life by refusing Akhilesh’s offerSitapur is just one of the many seats that went the INDIA bloc way as OBCs and dalits consolidated against BJP.In adjoining Dhaurhara, an SP candidate Anand Bhadauria won, while nearby Barabanki saw former Congress MP and dalit leader P L Punia’s son Tanuj winning with ease. In Faizabad, which includes Ayodhya and is a general seat, SP’s dalit candidate won comfortably.The ‘gatbandhan’ not only swept the Kaushambhi-Pratapgarh-Allahabad belt, but also eastern and central UP.SP-Congress outreach to OBCs, ‘most backwards’ and dalits saw a silent consolidation of votes in their favour, with the group voting to “save Ambedkar’s Constitution” and the ‘Mandalite agenda’. BJP’s anti-Yadav strategy that had helped woo this group from 2014 moved away from the saffron fold, while Muslim consolidation ensured there was no division of votes even in favour of “BJP’s proxy candidates” from the community under other banners.“Earlier, kamandalwadi politics was being done with mandalwadis, like Kalyan Singh and then Modi who projected himself as OBC. But this election saw the unification of OBCs for two reasons—BJP’s opposition to caste census and denial of quotas in the appointment of 68,000 teachers, which led to protests. On the other hand, SP-Congress spoke of PDA-caste census and gave tickets to OBCs in large numbers, while restricting Yadavs to the minimum,” said OP Singh, former MLA and minister in Mayawati govt.Despite PM Narendra Modi throwing the Muslim-mangalsutra-mujra gauntlet at INDIA bloc, the OBC-dalit combine did not get swayed and delivered an unprecedented victory to the opposition.","Rajesh Rathore, an anonymous man whom the locals say has neither a name nor a recall value, to fight the elections for Congress.

We will assess our performance and take strict action in favour of the party and the movement.”BSP contested 79 seats and gave tickets to Muslim candidates for 20 of these. Only five of them — in Amroha, Sambhal, Sant Kabir Nagar, Azamgarh and Ambedkarnagar — received more than 1.5 lakh votes. Qamar Hayat Ansari in Ambedkarnagar was the party's highest scorer with 1.9 lakh votes. The rest lost their respective contests by a margin of two to five lakh votes.A source said Mayawati had entrusted BSP's national general secretary SC Mishra with the task of assessing the reasons for the bruising poll setback.","BSP contested 79 seats and gave tickets to Muslim candidates for 20 of these.

These are Shiromani Akali Dal, All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen, Azad Samaj Party (Kanshi Ram), Bharat Adivasi Party, Zoram People’s Movement and Voice of the People Party.SAD is a Punjab-based party and a former ally of NDA. AIMIM is based out of Hyderabad and though vociferously opposed to BJP , it isn’t aligned with the INDIA bloc either. The same is true for Azad Samaj Party (Kanshi Ram), led by Dalit leader Chandrasekhar Azad. Bharat Adivasi Party from Rajasthan, Mizoram-based ZPM and Voice of the People Party from Meghalaya round off the cast.The seven Independents are Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav from Purnia (Bihar), Vishal (Dada) Prakashbapu Patil from Sangli (Maharashtra), Amritpal Singh from Khadoor Sahib (Punjab), Sarabjeet Singh Khalsa from Faridkot (Punjab), Umeshbhai Babubhai Patel from Daman and Diu, Abdul Rashid Sheikh from Baramulla (J&K) and Mohammad Haneefa from Ladakh.In the past, YSRCP has sided with the BJP-led govt for the passage of key bills. Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh on Wednesday called YSRCP the B-team of BJP.“Over the past 10 years, BJD was the B-team of BJP in Parliament. It supported Modi on every issue. Over the past 10 years, YSRCP was another B-team of BJP, which supported Modi on every issue. From B-teams, they have become the has-been teams. This is what happens to regional parties who place their trust in the ‘hum do’, who have suffered a humiliating moral and political defeat yesterday,” Ramesh said on X.","The 18th Lok Sabha will have 17 MPs who are Independents or non-aligned.

In contrast to the 2019 elections, where VBA had garnered between 2% and 8% of total votes cast in all six constituencies, pushing Nota to a distant position, Nota did well this time.

"Congress' crop cuts across caste, age lines",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-crop-cuts-across-caste-age-lines/articleshow/110748257.cms,"NEW DELHI: The rise in the Congress tally is not just about the numbers. The revival in party fortunes after a decade of stagnation has also refreshed its benches on generational and social lines.The new entrants include younger representatives who belong to SC/ST segments in good numbers as also general sections, with a fair mix of greenhorns and those with experience in the state legislatures. Congress is laying great store by its new members , as it waits to build on its new performance.Sample the election of Sanjna Jatav (26), Priyanka Jarkiholi (27), Praniti Shinde (43), Tanuj Punia (39), Sasikanth Senthil (44), Varun Chaudhry (44), as the faces from ST and SC communities, while Sagar Khandre (26), Raja Warring (46) are from general classes. Also joining the Congress ranks is former BJP MP from the Jat heartland in Rajasthan, Rahul Kaswan (47), who single handedly shook the ruling party with his rebellion and managed to create a stir in the desert state. Adding heft to the opposition bloc would be Charanjit Channi, the first Dalit CM of Punjab.Then, there are veterans like Kumari Selja and Varsha Gaikwad, who have served as ministers at the Centre and in the state respectively, just like Warring who has been a minister in Punjab while also being the current state unit president.They would add to the ranks of younger but weathered organisational hands Gaurav Gogoi, Manickam Tagore, Saptagiri Ulaka, and other veterans who have been around.Now, the Congress ranks have 13 women of which six belong to SC/ST communities. In all, the party has 31 members from reserved seats, while two are Dalits/tribals who have won from general constituencies.Congress is celebrating its performance in the 2024Lok Sabha polls as a major achievement given that its tally of 99 seats plus two “rebels” has come amid adverse political circumstances, and in the wake of a decade-long fall to the margins of national politics. The party could barely manage 44 and 52 seats in 2014 and 2019.The party also has a better regional balance now, given that it virtually vanished from the northern belt after the emergence of BJP as the dominant player in 2014. The eight members from Rajasthan, representing the rainbow social coalition of agrarian upper castes and SC/STs, and eight from Punjab, six from UP and five from Haryana, four from Bihar and two from Jharkhand, will help restore the national image of Congress. For the last decade, its numbers were largely confined to Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Telangana, with Punjab being the sole exception from the north.Adding to the mix will be the return of Rahul Gandhi as MP from Uttar Pradesh, a major change after his defeat in the family fief of Amethi in 2019 amplified the perception that Congress was a spent force in the north.","The new entrants include younger representatives who belong to SC/ST segments in good numbers as also general sections.

Mahayuti's tally of 18 may have further dipped to 14 in the event of a pact between MVA and Ambedkar , say experts. Congress and its allies in Maharashtra had held several rounds of negotiations with Ambedkar, but he had held firm on his demand for six seats.""We are doing a post-mortem on our poll defeat and will issue a statement to the media in a couple of days. All our candidates suffered this time. We were always ready to join MVA, but they refused to grant us a minimum number of seats to contest. We suggested just six seats, where our chance of winning was more, but they offered us just Akola and Mumbai North. So, we decided to fight on our own,"" Ambedkar told TOI on Wednesday.In 2019, VBA, which has a pro-dalit tilt, garnered over 41.3 lakh votes from the 48 Lok Sabha seats in Maharashtra. Its performance in three-cornered contests had a decisive effect in at least 10 seats. Congress and NCP candidates who lost due to the split in votes included big names like former CM Ashok Chavan, former FDA minister Rajendra Shingane and Ambedkar himself, who finished second from Akola.Compared to 2014, when VBA candidates contested on just four seats and secured a total vote share of 0.75%, the party's share in 2019 had spiralled to 14.75%. In 2024, its vote share has plunged to just 0.24% as it secured 15.79 lakh votes.On his poll strategy for the assembly polls later this year, the VBA chief said they would take a call on an alliance after analysing the situation.Majority VBA candidates finished at third, fourth and fifth position in the 38 seats it contested, including Ambedkar himself, who finished third with 2.76 lakh votes in Akola. The party's support base comprises Buddhist, Dalit, and minority communities. BJP's Anup Dhotre won the seat by over 40,000 votes against Congress candidate Dr Abhay Patil.

Why Didi’s Eleven is raring to say ‘Khela Hobe’ in West Bengal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-didis-eleven-is-raring-to-say-khela-hobe-in-west-bengal/articleshow/110747819.cms,"NEW DELHI: What do an anganwadi worker, two doctors, four actors, one investment banker and three career politicians have in common? They are all women, all newly elected MPs, all from Bengal, and all from Trinamool Congress . ‘ Didi’s Eleven ’ have put Bengal on top of the list of states that have sent the most female representatives to the 18th Lok Sabha.The 11 MPs were among a pool of 29 from the party — 37.9%, or more than one in three — that the party sent to the Lower House, the eclectic mix an indication of the depth of the party’s pool of female representatives.That’s perhaps not surprising. The party, founded by a woman in 1998, has always been committed to women’s empowerment and welfare, party seniors say.Trinamool’s first batch to Lok Sabha — in 1999 — had two women out of eight MPs. Apart from founder Mamata Banerjee, Krishna Bose, a historian and a member of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s family, was the other parliamentarian then.From two women MPs in 1998 to 12 in 2014 and 11 in 2024, it’s been an eventful journey, one that mirrors the importance of women in Bengali society, said Sukhendu Sekhar Roy, a Trinamool Rajya Sabha MP and spokesperson.“From the women-centric schemes that help even the poorest of women in Bengal’s villages, to the representation that we give women in the highest chamber of Indian democracy, everything represents our commitment to women’s uplift,” he added.For the 2024 poll battle, 12 women got Trinamool tickets, of whom 11 won.BJP had fielded five women, including former Union minister Debasree Chowdhury and other big names like Agnimitra Paul and Locket Chatterjee, apart from surprise newbies like Rekha Patra and Amrita Roy. Each lost.The high number of women getting elected from Bengal is not a flash in the pan, felt sociologist Prashanta Roy. “Women voters tend to choose Trinamool. The CM herself, being a woman, is also a reason, along with social schemes like Lakhsmir Bhandar,” he explained.The winning MPs agree. “In Bengal, women’s empowerment has been on the upswing since Mamata Banerjee became CM in 2011,” said first-time MP Sharmila Sarkar, who was elected from Burdwan East. “We’ve created a milieu where women can assert themselves.”ICDS worker Mitali Bag, also a first-time MP (from Arambag), said: “I want to ensure no one in my constituency faces the hardships I’ve had to face. Inspired by Didi, I want to take women forward.”Yet another first-time MP, actor June Maliah, felt her party has “walked the talk” when it came to women’s empowerment. “And we can assure one thing: this team of 11 women is going to make a lot of noise in Parliament,” she said. “We will raise our voice on issues that matter.”— Inputs from Mohammad Asif","Bengal has sent the most female representatives to the 18th Lok Sabha. The 11 MPs were among a pool of 29 from the party — 37.9% or more than one in three. The party, founded by a woman in 1998, has always been committed to women’s empowerment and welfare.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110747833,imgsize-27980,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/110747833.jpg"

I accept that I personally fell short and I will take steps to make up for these shortcomings.” Addressing the media at the BJP state headquarters in Mumbai, he said, “I shall request the party leadership to relieve me of govt responsibilities so that I can work full-time for the party in view of the upcoming assembly elections. Whatever is required to be done in govt shall be done by our team,” he said.Reacting to Fadnavis’ statement, CM Shinde said that the electoral defeat was a collective responsibility and that he would talk to Fadnavis soon.Fadnavis in his press meet admitted to mistakes in failing to assess the anti-incumbency factor while deciding on LS poll candidates, such as farmer issues not being fully addressed including the onion price issue. He said there were global issues with regard to soyabean and cotton, and while the govt did announce compensation, not all of it could be distributed on account of the election code of conduct.Elections, he said, had a certain arithmetic. Thus, in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, BJP secured 27.8% of the vote share and won 23 seats. However, this time BJP secured 26.2% vote share, a decline of less than 1.5% over last time, but it got only nine seats. On the other hand, Congress got a 17% vote share this time as against 16.4% in the last LS elections but won 13 seats against one in 2019.

Though the TMC candidate polled nearly 4.2 lakh votes, he lost to the BJP candidate by a margin of 44,072. The BSP candidate polled nearly 1.6 lakh votes, which may have helped the BJP candidate, Dr Vinod Kumar Bind, win.

Rajasthan's Phalodi Satta bazar loses the bet,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rajasthans-phalodi-satta-bazar-loses-the-bet/articleshow/110747411.cms,"JAIPUR: Often looked up to as a predictor of election outcomes , Rajasthan's popular Phalodi Satta Bazar market failed this time, with BJP securing fewer seats than anticipated, both in the state and in the country. The satta market is known for its accurate predictions in elections, cricket matches or weather forecasts.Until late Monday night, on the eve of the counting of votes, the betting market was offering odds of 1:1 for BJP to secure 303-306 seats, meaning a bet of Rs 1 would yield a profit of Rs 1. Similarly, the market predicted that Congress would win 61-63 seats, with the same 1:1 odds.In Rajasthan, the market predicted a maximum of 20 and a minimum of 19 seats for the BJP, and a maximum of 6 seats for Congress. But BJP only secured 14 seats, falling 5 seats short of the prediction, while Congress gained 5 seats.A punter who was closely following the market said, ""Until the last minute, the market showed no signs BJP would win fewer than 300 seats. A margin of 7-8 seats in a poll is significant,"" he said.A bookie said the market has sources for political information, with individuals placed across major political centres. The bazaar sets rates based on the inputs it receives. However, it keeps on fluctuating as per the trend. When the betting market opened two months before the LS election, the number of seats predicted for BJP had decreased considerably. In mid-April, bookies were expecting BJP to win a maximum of 325 seats and a minimum of 322, and they were accepting bets accordingly.The bookie said, ""This doesn't mean that all punters lost. Some placed bets on BJP, while others on Congress. The market only provides rates based on trends, it does not influence any punter.

"Mantris’ loss, need for allies will give ministry new look",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mantris-loss-need-for-allies-will-give-ministry-new-look/articleshow/110747350.cms,"New govt’s 100-day agenda set for rejig

NEW DELHI: With 19 Union ministers , including at least four with cabinet rank , losing elections, there is space to accommodate new faces , although some BJP members who could not make it to the 18th Lok Sabha may return through the upper House.In any case, there were several ministries — ranging from communications to electronics and IT, petroleum, agriculture, food and consumer affairs, textiles, steel, environment, skill development, chemicals and fertilisers, cooperation, sports and youth affairs and minority affairs — which were being handled by different ministers holding “additional charge”.These could come handy when portfolio allocation is discussed within BJP leadership as well as with allies , some of whom could be eyeing prominent ministries. There is also scope to induct more ministers, the outgoing council of ministers included 71 members; almost 10 short of what is allowed.Although there was talk of merging ministries, Tuesday’s election results, necessitating the inclusion of allies, may result in the issue being put on the backburner.Over the last two terms, Prime Minister Modi has clubbed some ministries, seeking to draw upon the synergies, and may continue with the practice. For instance, power and new & renewable energy have been handled by the same minister. Similarly, communications and IT ministries were given to Ashwini Vaishnaw (who was also railway minister) and to Ravi Shankar Prasad before him. Since 2014, the finance and corporate affairs ministries have also been part of one portfolio.The size of the ministry is unlikely to be smaller. For, the last two terms, when allies were given ministries such as heavy industries, civil aviation and steel, BJP will be under pressure this time to cede “meatier” portfolios.Regional balance will need to be established too. For instance, the composition of the council of ministers, so far tilted in favour of the north to suit the region’s contribution to the strength, may have to aligned with the organisational priority for a southern push.As usual, electoral considerations will weigh. For instance, Odisha may be rewarded for the mandate and yet, Uttar Pradesh, where the saffron party suffered a setback, cannot be ignored. Similarly, state elections in Maharashtra due later this year and in Bihar next year will be part of the calculation. But with allies from these states going to be part of the cabinet, the leadership may face a problem seeking to accommodate BJP MPs from these states.The first 100-day agenda of the new govt is set to go back to the drawing board after allocation of Cabinet portfolios to ministers.TOI has learnt that inputs and ideas of new ministers would be included for some tweaks or improvements in the plans, which have been prepared by the Special Group of Secretaries and has been presented to the cabinet secretariat.","With 19 Union ministers, including at least four with cabinet rank, losing elections, there is space to accommodate new faces.

Although the law prevents them from participating in the proceedings of the 18th general polls in India, they still possess the Constitutional right to take the oath of office as members of Parliament.According to the Election Commission's announcement on Tuesday, Amritpal Singh, a jailed Sikh preacher, has secured victory in the Khadoor Sahib constituency, while Sheikh Abdul Rashid, also known as ""Engineer Rashid,"" who is currently imprisoned, has won the Baramulla seat.Engineer Rashid has been lodged in the Tihar jail since August 9, 2019 on charges of alleged terror financing, while Singh has been booked under the National Security Act and sent to the Dibrugarh jail of Assam.The question that arises is whether these jailed candidates can be permitted to take the oath of office, and if so, what procedures are involved.PDT Achari, a Constitution expert and former Lok Sabha secretary general, stressed the importance of adhering to Constitutional provisions in such cases. He said that being sworn in as a member of Parliament is a constitutional right, reported PTI.However, due to their current incarceration, Engineer Rashid and Singh must obtain permission from the authorities to be escorted to Parliament for the oath-taking ceremony. After taking the oath, they will be required to return to jail.Achari further clarified the legal aspects by referring to Article 101 (4) of the Constitution, which addresses the absence of members from both Houses of Parliament without prior approval from the Chair.He explained that after taking the oath, they will inform the Speaker in writing about their inability to attend House proceedings. The Speaker will then forward their requests to the House Committee on Absence of Members.The Committee will then make a recommendation on whether the member should be allowed to remain absent from House proceedings. The Speaker will then put the recommendation to a vote in the House.If Engineer Rashid or Singh are convicted and sentenced to a minimum of two years in prison, they will immediately lose their seats in the Lok Sabha, as per the Supreme Court's 2013 judgment. This decision invalidated Section 8(4) of the Representation of the People Act, which previously allowed convicted MPs and MLAs a three-month period to appeal their convictions.","Engineer Rashid has been lodged in the Tihar jail since August 9, 2019 on charges of alleged terror financing.
