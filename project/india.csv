The case has been under investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation ( CBI ) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED).K Kavitha after her release spoke to reporters and said, ""I want to thank all of you.I became emotional after meeting my son, brother and husband today after almost 5 months. Only politics is responsible for this situation. The country knows that I was put in jail only because of politics, I did not make any mistake I will fight...""Kavitha said, ""We are fighters, we will fight it out legally and politically. They have only made the BRS and KCR's team unbreakable"".The apex court's bench, comprising Justices BR Gavai and KV Viswanathan, ordered her immediate release on strict conditions, including the submission of her passport to the trial court and regular attendance at trial proceedings.Kavitha, who had been in custody for five months, was released after furnishing a bail bond of Rs 10 lakh each in both the CBI and ED cases. The court emphasized that she must not tamper with evidence or influence witnesses during the ongoing trial.""The appellant is directed to be forthwith released on bail in both cases. She shall not make any attempt to tamper with evidence or influence the witnesses,"" the court ruled.During the hearing, the Supreme Court questioned the evidence presented by the CBI and ED against Kavitha. The bench noted that the investigation was complete, and the chargesheet had been filed, making her continued custody unnecessary. The court further stated that undertrial custody should not become a form of punishment, particularly when the trial's conclusion is unlikely to occur in the near future.Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, representing Kavitha, argued that the investigating agencies had already completed their investigation against her and drew parallels with the Supreme Court's decision to grant bail to Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Manish Sisodia, who is a co-accused in the same cases.However, the additional solicitor general, S V Raju, representing the investigating agencies, alleged that Kavitha had destroyed or formatted her mobile phone, which he claimed amounted to evidence tampering. Rohatgi dismissed the allegation as ""bogus.""The Supreme Court also addressed the Delhi High Court's earlier decision to deny Kavitha bail, describing the high court's reasoning that bail could not be granted simply because a woman is educated and independent as ""perverse"" and ordered it to be quashed.Kavitha, the daughter of Telangana chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao, was arrested by the ED in Hyderabad on March 15 and by the CBI on April 11 while she was in Tihar jail.

'Stop this murderous game', says West Bengal governor

NEW DELHI: Kolkata and the adjacent Howrah witnessed large-scale violence on Tuesday as protests over the alleged rape and murder of a junior doctor at RG Kar Medical College turned into pitched battles between demonstrators and the police.The unrest began when protestors, aiming to march to the West Bengal state secretariat, Nabanna, were intercepted by police at multiple locations.The ensuing clashes, which lasted nearly four hours, saw protestors pelting stones and glass bottles, leading to injuries on both sides. Senior police officers and women protestors were among those hurt, with 15 personnel from Kolkata Police and 14 from the state police sustaining injuries. Over 200 people were arrested across the state.Here are the top developments in the case:Demonstrators faced a strong response from police on Tuesday during the 'Nabanna Abhijan' protest march in Howrah's Santragachi area. The police employed water cannons to disperse the protesters who were attempting to scale the barricades and engaged in confrontations with the officers on duty.The situation escalated as the demonstrators ""dragged away police barricades,"" prompting the authorities to resort to lathicharge and the use of tear gas shells to regain control. Heavy police had been deployed around the West Bengal state secretariat to maintain order and prevent any untoward incidents.In response to the police action, the BJP announced a 12-hour general strike in West Bengal on August 28. The strike is a protest against what the BJP described as the ""autocratic"" crackdown on peaceful demonstrators seeking justice for the deceased doctor.BJP state president Sukanta Majumdar criticised chief minister Mamata Banerjee's government, accusing it of ignoring public outcry and failing to ensure the safety of women in the state. He condemned the police's use of batons, tear gas, and water cannons to disperse the crowd, who were demanding Banerjee's resignation.The CBI has intensified its probe into the RG Kar Medical College rape-murder case, seeking court permission to conduct a polygraph test on Kolkata Police assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Anup Dutta. Dutta is suspected of having extended various favors to the accused, Sanjay Roy, and the CBI aims to uncover whether Roy confided in Dutta about the crime.To strengthen its investigation, the CBI will consult forensic experts from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) regarding the DNA and forensic evidence in the case. This step is crucial to confirm whether Sanjay Roy acted alone or if others were involved in the heinous crime. The CBI has been working on the premise that Roy was the sole perpetrator, but the involvement of others can only be ruled out after receiving expert opinions from AIIMS.The violent protests have further intensified the political battle between the BJP and the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC). The BJP has accused chief minister Mamata Banerjee of protecting those involved in the crime and demanded her resignation to ensure a fair probe. The party also called for a polygraph test on Banerjee and Kolkata Police Commissioner Vineet Goel, alleging a cover-up. On the other hand, the TMC hit back, accusing the BJP of orchestrating chaos and disrupting law and order in the state.West Bengal governor CV Ananda Bose conveyed his distress regarding the turmoil that engulfed Kolkata's streets in the aftermath of the 'Nabanna Abhijan' protest rally on Tuesday. Bose described the scenes witnessed in the city as a ghastly sight.""I would say disproportionate force and coercive power were used by the state in dealing with the situation, ignoring the Supreme Court's pronouncements that state power shall not be unleashed against peaceful protesters. This is the ghastly sight that we saw today on the streets of Kolkata. Certainly, this cannot be appreciated in any manner,"" he said.Bose emphasised that the current state of affairs is far from normal, and all individuals involved in public life feel compelled to unite and confront the government's irresponsible actions, given the severity of the situation.","Kolkata and Howrah witnessed large-scale violence on Tuesday as protests over the alleged rape and murder of a junior doctor turned into pitched battles between demonstrators and the police.

The party has called for a CBI investigation into the matter and petitioned the Karnataka governor to dismiss Priyank Kharge, Mallikarjun Kharge's son, from the state cabinet.The controversy revolves around the alleged allocation of five acres of land by the Karnataka Industrial Area Development Board (KIADB) to the Siddhartha Vihar Trust, run by the Kharge family, in the hi-tech Defence Aerospace Park near Bengaluru.The trust includes Mallikarjun Kharge, his wife Radhabai, son Priyank Kharge, son-in-law Radhakrishna Doddamani, and younger son Rahul Kharge.BJP's national spokesperson, Gaurav Bhatia, demanded the resignation of Mallikarjun Kharge as Congress president and Priyank Kharge as a Karnataka minister. He also called for Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah to step down.""There is a consistency in the Congress' acts of corruption. Wherever we will go we will do corruption is the new slogan of the Congress. It will not be wrong to say that the Congress has become synonymous with corruption,"" Bhatia said.Bhatia pointed to the alleged irregularities, stating, ""As per information with us, several companies and organisations had given applications for the land, but it was allocated to the Kharge family-run trust by flouting the rules."" He also referenced previous alleged scams under the Siddaramaiah government, including the MUDA and Valmiki Development Corporation scams.Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah defended the land allocation, stating, ""It has been done in accordance with law. Their trust is eligible, so we have done it."" He further questioned the BJP's previous decisions, asking, ""How did the BJP (while in power) allot the land for Chanakya University? We have done it in accordance with law.""Additionally, leader of opposition in the Karnataka legislative council, Chalavadi T Narayanaswamy, described the land allocation as a case of ""criminal breach of trust"" by the Kharge family towards fellow Scheduled Caste entrepreneurs. ""With utmost pain, I bring to your kind knowledge another case of nepotism of the Karnataka government,"" Narayanaswamy stated in a letter submitted to governor Thaawarchand Gehlot.Earlier today, speaking to reporters before meeting the governor, Narayanaswamy reiterated his stance, saying, ""It is clear to the naked eye that the land has been given to prominent and influential people.""Meanwhile, BJP leader and member of Rajya Sabha Lahar Singh Siroya on Sunday questioned the eligibility of the Kharge family to receive the KIADB land, asking, ""When did they become aerospace entrepreneurs to be eligible for the land?"" He further inquired whether the case involved misuse of power, nepotism, and conflict of interest.Reacting to these accusations, Priyank Kharge on Monday clarified that the site allocated to the trust is not meant for industrial or commercial purposes but for educational purposes. ""The intention of the trust is to set up a multi-skill development centre in the CA site,"" Priyank Kharge said, questioning, ""Is it wrong?""He said that there was no subsidy or subsidised rate for civic amenity plots allotted to SC/ST organizations and defended the trust's eligibility, stating, ""The trustees have a background of establishing and managing good quality and affordable education institutions."" Priyank Kharge further criticised the BJP, saying, ""BJP lacks basic common sense that CA sites are not allotted or auctioned; they have to be purchased as per KIADB and government guidelines."" He noted that only 43 organizations applied for 193 available sites, dismissing the allegations of nepotism and influence as ""baseless.""Priyank also pointed out that the previous BJP government had allocated lands to various institutions, including Prerana Trust, Chanakya University, and Rashtrotthana, questioning the legitimacy of those decisions.""Here we are purchasing a CA site, we have not sought any subsidy or deferred payment or anything illegal. What is illegal in this, I don't understand,"" Priyank said, accusing the BJP of politicising the issue by invoking the names of the chief minister and Mallikarjun Kharge.","The controversy revolves around the alleged allocation of five acres of land by the Karnataka Industrial Area Development Board to the Siddhartha Vihar Trust.

The individuals responsible for the fabrication and installation of the statue might have overlooked important local factors, such as high wind speed and the quality of the iron used.

It needs the boost considering that it drew a blank in the 14 seats in the Kolhan region in 2019 as well as in light of the success of Hemant Soren in turning his arrest by ED into a case of injustice to tribals in the Lok Sabha elections which saw the saffron party losing all the five seats reserved for tribals.Some of the BJP insiders went to the extent of saying Champai's joining is set to fetch the party at least eight to 10 seats in Kolhan, brightening its prospects in the state polls this year.Party sources said Soren is joining the party unconditionally, but they acknowledge his key role in the selection of candidates, especially in the Kolhan region, as he will also bring with him the legacy of JMM which he was associated with since the statehood agitation days, being one of the most trusted aides of party patriarch Sibu Soren.Even the JMM leadership seems to be worried about his imminent departure as the party has not taken action against Champai, who earlier expressed outrage over the JMM leadership, accusing it of humiliating him and forcing him to quit as chief minister unceremoniously.",Champai Soren is likely to help BJP counter Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren's attempt to polarise tribals against the party.

NEW DELHI: The NDA reached the majority mark in Rajya Sabha on its own for the first time since it assumed office in 2014 with BJP winning nine seats and its allies two in bypolls to 12 seats in the latest round. All candidates were elected unopposed.BJP now has 96 seats in the House of 237, with eight seats - four in J&K and four in the nominated category - lying vacant.Along with allies and the support of six nominated and two Independent members, NDA has touched the majority mark of 119. With its improved tally, NDA can get any legislation passed without having to enlist the support of friendly non-NDA, non-UPA parties. In its last term, Modi govt had to depend on either YSRCP (11 members), BJD (8) or AIADMK (4) to get the required numbers in RS. NDA reaching the majority mark on its own is crucial given the uncertainties attached to YSRCP and BJD which have decided to side with the opposition this time.Since nominated members invariably go with the governing party, govt has one more window to increase its lead once it nominates four members to the vacant seats. In that case, NDA's tally with support of nominated and independent MPs will reach 123 - two more than the majority mark in the House of 241.Congress' Abhishek Manu Singhvi won the lone seat from Telangana unopposed, with the party reaching 27 in the Upper House - two more than what it needs to retain its leader of opposition post in Rajya Sabha. Before the bypolls, the party had 26 members, putting the fate of leader of opposition Mallikarjun Kharge hanging by a thread.In the bypolls, BJP won one seat each from Madhya Pradesh (George Kurian), Rajasthan (Ravneet Singh Bittu), Odisha (Mamata Mohanta), Tripura (Rajib Bhattacharjee), Maharashtra (Dhairyashil Patil), Bihar (Manan Kumar Mishra) and Haryana (Kiran Choudhry), and two from Assam (Rameswar Teli and Mission Ranjan Das) whereas its allies won one seat each from Bihar (Upendra Kushwaha of Rashtriya Lok Manch) and Maharashtra (Nitin Patil of NCP).Ten of the 12 seats fell vacant as sitting BJP, Congress and RJD members from seven states were elected to Lok Sabha while one member each from Telangana and Odisha resigned and switched to other parties. In Telangana, BRS member K Keshava Rao resigned and joined Congress while in Odisha BJD's Mamata Mohanta resigned and joined BJP.","The NDA reached the majority mark in Rajya Sabha on its own for the first time since it assumed office in 2014.

"SC questions fairness of ED, CBI probe, gives Kavitha bail",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-questions-fairness-of-ed-cbi-probe-gives-kavitha-bail/articleshow/112846750.cms,"'Be fair': SC says 2 others not being tried

NEW DELHI: In a relief to Bharat Rashtra Samithi's K Kavitha who has been in custody for the last five months in the Delhi excise policy case, Supreme Court Tuesday granted her bail in both corruption and money laundering cases, and put CBI and ED in the dock over its ""fairness"" and ""pick-and-choose"" approach in arresting accused in the case.A bench of Justices B R Gavai and K V Viswanathan said the trial was not going to conclude soon and undertrial custody should not become a punishment for an accused.The bench also expressed strong disapproval of Delhi high court's order rejecting Kavitha's plea for bail as per Sec 45 of PMLA that makes a special case for bail for women, among other categories. The HC had said Kavitha being ""highly educated and accomplished"" could not be given benefit of the provision which was meant for a ""vulnerable woman"". SC said courts could not create a subcategory when the provision only mentioned 'woman'.After half-an-hour of hearing and after examining some of the evidence, the bench raised objections over the probe and told additional solicitor general S V Raju that if he continued to argue the case on behalf of the agencies, then it would have to pass a detailed order and would have to pass observations on the merits of the evidence which could affect trial proceedings. Reluctantly, the ASG relented. He agreed for bail to Kavitha and asked the court not to pass any remarks on the merits of the case, paving the way for the court to pass a brief order granting bail. The bench also clarified in its order that its observations would have no bearing on the merits of the case.Kavitha, daughter of former Telangana chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao, who was arrested by ED on March 15, is the third high profile accused after AAP leader Manish Sisodia and MP Sanjay Singh to come out of prison in the case. Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal got bail in the PMLA case but his bail plea in the CBI case is pending in SC.The bench invoked the same principle applied in Sisodia’s case that delay in trial and long incarceration could be grounds for bail in money laundering cases. The court noted that the probe against Kavitha in both cases was complete and chargesheet/complaint had been filed in court and no custodial interrogation was needed. It said trial in both cases were unlikely to be completed soon since there are about 493 witnesses and the documentary evidence runs to nearly 50,000 pages and it was a fit case for bail as an undertrial’s custody should not be turned into a punishment.On the high court’s order denying bail on grounds of Kavitha being “highly educated and accomplished”, the bench said, “This court puts a caution that courts, while deciding such matters, should exercise discretion judiciously. The court does not say that merely because a woman is well-educated or sophisticated or a member of Parliament or member of Legislative Council is not entitled to the benefit of Section 45 of PMLA Act. We find that the learned single-judge bench totally misdirected itself,” the SC said.The bench also questioned why Buchi Babu, the auditor who allegedly received Rs 25 crore on behalf of Kavitha, was not an accused in the money laundering case when ED accepted that he took money. The court also said the role of Magunta Reddy, a liquor businessman, was similar to Kavitha’s but he was not made an accused but a witness. Reddy’s son was made an accused but he was granted pardon and turned approver in the case.“Prosecution has to be fair. A person who incriminates himself has been made a witness. Tomorrow, you pick up anyone as you please and leave anyone as you choose? You cannot pick and choose any accused. What is this fairness? Sorry to see this state of affairs. If he has a role, his role is almost equal to that of Kavitha. So you will pick and choose anyone?” the bench said.Sensing the mood of the bench, CBI and ED decided not to press the case against Kavitha as any adverse observations by the SC on the merits of the case would affect the trial.The bail plea of another accused in the case, Vijay Nair, also came up for hearing on Tuesday before a bench headed by Justice Hrishikesh Roy. It deferred the case for a week after CBI-ED sought time to respond to his petition.","Kavitha, daughter of former Telangana chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao, was arrested by ED on March 15.

It is an emotional moment for me, and I am truly honoured,” Iltija said.She reflected on her family’s deep political roots in Bijbehara, noting that both her grandfather Mufti Mohammad Sayeed and her mother Mehbooba began their political careers in this constituency. “This is the continuation of a legacy and it is a privilege to be part of this tradition,” Iltija said.Mehbooba has vowed not to contest assembly elections until J&K’s statehood is restored.

His son and current NC chief Farooq Abdullah won the seat in 1983, 1987, and 1996. In 2008, Omar was elected from Ganderbal.Omar admitted that staying out of the elections contradicted the party’s efforts. “Seeking votes from the people while not being a candidate myself seemed contradictory,” he said. His change of stand came Monday after the formalisation of the NC-Congress seat-sharing pact for the three-phase polls from Sept 18 to Oct 1.These elections will be the first since the 2019 abrogation of Article 370 and the bifurcation of the region into two Union territories, including Ladakh. The NC-Congress campaign centres on the restoration of J&K’s statehood, a demand that resonates across both Kashmir valley and Jammu.“We are committed to defeating BJP and its allies. We have presented our manifesto and roadmap to the people,” Omar said.According to the deal, NC will contest 51 seats, Congress will vie for 32, while one seat each has been allocated to CPM and J&K National Panthers Party — both part of INDIA bloc. The alliance will field candidates for 83 of the 90 seats, leaving room for “friendly contests” in five constituencies.NC has released names of 44 candidates. “Since NC and Congress will contest the elections as a united front, some NC members will not be able to contest on the party’s ticket due to the alliance,” Omar said.Omar also welcomed the decision of several former militants, separatists, and their relatives to contest the elections, calling it a “huge development”. “Those who had declared elections haram and questioned J&K’s place within India are now willing to join the electoral race,” he said.Dr Talat Majeed and Nazir Ahmad, former members of the banned Jamaat-e-Islami J&K, filed their nominations Tuesday as independent candidates from Pulwama and Devsar constituencies, respectively. Another former separatist is expected to file his papers for Sopore in north Kashmir.“We have to look at the situation from a geopolitical perspective… I thought we should get into the mainstream,” Majeed said, emphasising the importance of political engagement to address the region’s problems and represent the people’s aspirations in a changing political landscape.Jamaat-e-Islami J&K, which participated in elections until 1987, saw Hurriyat leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani serve as an MLA for three terms before the assembly was dissolved in 1990 because of militancy.The group recently announced its support to independents, with its former general secretary Ghulam Qadir Lone saying: “Our backing will depend on the candidates’ character and their commitment to assisting with legal efforts to lift the ban. We will vote because it’s our constitutional and democratic right and the only path to achieving change.”","National Conference (NC) vice president Omar Abdullah will contest from Ganderbal constituency in central Kashmir, sources said Tuesday.

With a heavy heart, I said in a meeting of the legislative party that - 'A new chapter of my life is going to start from today'. I had three options in this. First, to retire from politics, second, to form my own separate organisation and third, if I find a companion on this path, then to travel further with him. From that day till today, and till the upcoming Jharkhand Assembly elections, all options are open for me in this journey,"" Champai Soren had said in a post on X.",Champai Soren briefly served as Jharkhand's 12th chief minister.

NEW DELHI: The BJP on Monday reprimanded party MP Kangana Ranaut and distanced itself from her controversial remarks suggesting that farmers' protests could have led to a Bangladesh-like situation in the country if the BJP's top leadership was not strong enough.“The statement made by BJP MP Kangana Ranaut in the context of the farmers' movement is not the opinion of the party.The Bharatiya Janata Party expresses its disagreement with the statement made by Kangana Ranaut,” the BJP said in a statement.

But they are still sitting there,"" she said. The BJP MP also claimed that China, America, and other foreign powers were involved in this conspiracy to destroy the country with the help of insiders.The Congress reacted strongly to Kangana's remarks. Responding to her post, senior Congress leader Surjewala wrote on X, “After all, why do BJP people hate the country's food providers so much?

The question is that, has Kangana made this cheap allegation against the farmers as per the BJP's election strategy?”The All India Kisan Sabha also condemned the BJP MP's remarks. AIKS president Dr Ashok Dhawale said Ranaut's remarks were highly condemnable, adding these were made by the actor-turned-politician to please her ""external and internal bosses who want to devour agriculture"".
