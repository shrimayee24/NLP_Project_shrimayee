NEW DELHI: Shiv Sena leader and Maharashtra tourism minister Shambhuraj Desai urged police on Thursday to promptly arrest comedian Kunal Kamra , cautioning against testing party workers' patience.This comes after Sena workers had vandalised a Mumbai studio on Sunday night where Kamra had recorded his show, expressing anger over his parody song criticising Maharashtra deputy Chief Minister and Shiv Sena president Eknath Shinde ""We have been asked by Shinde to be observe restraint, that is why we are quiet. As Shiv Sena workers, we know how to drag him out from wherever he is hiding, but as ministers we have some restrictions,"" Desai told reporters. ""We want to tell the police, do not test our patience and nab him from wherever he is, put him in a tyre and give him 'prasad',"" he added. In Marathi, 'prasad' traditionally refers to a divine offering, whilst also serving as a subtle reference to punishment.This row erupted when, during his recent performance, Kamra performed a parody version of a popular song from ""Dil Toh Pagal Hai"", incorporating the term ""gaddar"" (traitor), apparently directed at Shinde.Following Sunday night's vandalism at the Habitat Comedy Club in Khar by Shinde-led Shiv Sena activists, several individuals were arrested and subsequently released on bail.

The accused named in the case include former Maharashtra minister Aaditya Thackeray, ex-Mumbai Police Commissioner Parambir Singh, former officer Sachin Vaze, and actor Aditya Pancholi.Speaking to ANI on Thursday, Satish Salian claimed he had initially been misled into believing that his daughter had died by suicide.

Therefore, it’s requested that further orders be awaited before the conflicting orders of the high courts are acted upon,” Gauba quoted Singh as saying in his order.The RO – a former Delhi high court judge – said that the election process would remain paused until the federation informs him of the steps taken in response to the court orders.“Thus, the process is paused till BFI informs of the action taken in the wake of the court orders,” Gauba wrote.Two days ago, the Delhi High Court had stayed the federation’s March 7 directive signed by Singh that “only duly-elected members of BFI’s affiliated units are authorised to represent their respective states in the elections”.The court had ruled on a petition filed by the Delhi Amateur Boxing Association (DABA), paving the way for its office-bearers Rohit Jainendra Jain and Neeraj Kant Bhatt to vote in the BFI’s annual general meeting (AGM) as Delhi boxing body’s representatives.On Thursday, another ruling by the Himachal Pradesh High Court allowed former sports minister Anurag Thakur to contest the BFI’s presidential election by staying his disqualification from the electoral college based on the March 7 circular, and directed Gauba to include the senior BJP leader’s name as one of the representatives from the Himachal boxing body to enable his candidature.It’s been learnt that the Maharashtra state boxing association has also filed a writ petition before the High Court of Judicature at Bombay, impleading the RO to stay the elections.",Boxing Federation of India ’s forthcoming elections were on Friday “paused’ by Returning Officer RK Gauba.
