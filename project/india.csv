NEW DELHI: BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya on Tuesday flagged an alleged public altercation between Trinamool Congress MPs Kalyan Banerjee and Kirti Azad - a former cricketer - at the Election Commission headquarters on April 4. He also claimed that tensions also spilled over onto a party WhatsApp group, with a cryptic reference to a ""versatile international lady"" fuelling the drama.Taking to X, Malviya wrote that the two TMC MPs had a heated exchange at the ECI office, where they had gone to submit a memorandum. According to him, ""It appears the party had instructed its MPs to gather at the Parliament office to sign the memorandum before proceeding to the EC. However, the MP carrying the memorandum skipped the Parliament meeting and went directly to the EC.""This reportedly irked the other MP, leading to a loud verbal confrontation that required ""police intervention.""The matter, Malviya claimed, escalated to West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee , who instructed both MPs to stand down.However, the episode didn’t end there. Screenshots posted by Malviya, allegedly from the ‘AITC MP 2024’ WhatsApp group, show that the feud continued online, with TMC leaders taking sides and trading accusations.The alleged WhatsApp exchange between TMC MPs Kalyan Banerjee and Kirti Azad, shared by BJP's Amit Malviya, shows a personal turn in their growing spat. Banerjee appeared to take a veiled dig at Azad, writing:""Today I Congratulate the gentleman who opened the beautiful activities of versatile international lady. That day not a single boyfriend of her stood behind her. This foolish man whom she wanted to arrested by BSF, stood behind her. Today of course 30 years famous player stood behind her to get me arrested.""Azad, in his purported response, said: ""Take it easy Kalyan. You have had one too many. Don't act like a juvenile delinquent. You have been entrusted with a very serious responsibility by Didi to everyone along with you. So relax, have a nice sleep. I have no axe to grind with you. I humbly request you as a senior in age to me, not in politics to kindly take everyone together. Stop your childish and erratic behivour. Act like an adult. Don't instigate anybody. Think with the cool mind. Good night.""“In the middle of it all,” Malviya wrote, “the question still lingers: who exactly is the ‘versatile international lady’? That mystery is one for the world to unravel.”","BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya flagged an alleged public altercation between Trinamool Congress MPs Kalyan Banerjee and Kirti Azad.

BENGALURU: Karnataka home minister G Parameshwara sparked outrage Monday by appearing to make light of safety concerns stoked by an unidentified stalker molesting a woman in Bengaluru's Bharathi Layout, saying that ""in a big city like Bengaluru, incidents like this do take place here and there"".Parameshwara's remark came amid a search for a suspect caught on CCTV camera stalking two women, one of whom he held against a wall and allegedly molested at 1.52am on April 3. The home minister said police were working round-the-clock ""in rain and cold"" to prevent crimes that were ""unfortunate"", albeit not ""uncommon"" in a city the size of Karnataka's capital. ""I regularly tell the Bengaluru police commissioner (B Dayananda) to ensure patrolling of every area in a disciplined and effective way.""BJP demanded Congress MPs Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra respond to Parameshwara's remark.

"After tulip stroll with Rijiju, Waqf thorns sprout for Omar Abdullah",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-tulip-stroll-with-rijiju-waqf-thorns-sprout-for-omar-abdullah/articleshow/120073497.cms,"SRINAGAR: J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah went for morning walk Monday in Srinagar’s famed Tulip Garden with Union minister Kiran Rijiju, leading a prickly opposition in the assembly hours later to slam him over rejection of a motion to discuss the Waqf law while indulging in a stroll with the man who piloted it in Parliament.Two contrasting pictures played out. Union minority affairs minister Rijiju described his walk “amid vibrant hues” with Omar and his father, National Conference (NC) president Farooq Abdullah, as “refreshing”. Hardly so, chorused People’s Democratic Party (PDP) and Peoples Conference as they slammed Omar in the assembly over laying out the “red carpet for the BJP minister who introduced the Waqf bill meant to disempower and debilitate Muslims”.The assembly witnessed prolonged shouting matches after Speaker Abdul Rahim Rather -- who is from NC -- rejected the adjournment motion brought by nine legislators to discuss the Waqf (Amendment) Act. These included eight NC members.Rather pointed out that the Waqf (amendment) bill had now become law with the President giving consent. Also, the law has been challenged in the Supreme Court and assembly rules prohibit debates on a sub-judice issue, the Speaker contended.But NC legislator Tanvir Sadiq, who moved the adjournment motion, cited precedents where laws passed by Parliament were discussed in assemblies across the country. Punjab and Rajasthan assemblies had discussed farm bills, Sadiq said. PDP’s Waheed Parra weighed in, saying Tamil Nadu assembly recently discussed the Waqf law.BJP legislators thumped tables, applauding the Speaker. NC legislators waved black bands, railing against the Waqf Act as a “black law” and raising Allahu Akbar slogans. BJP MLAs chanted Jai Shri Ram.PDP president and former CM Mehbooba Mufti accused NC of “meekly surrendering before the BJP” “It’s disappointing that the Speaker has rejected the Waqf motion. Despite securing a strong mandate, the (NC) govt appears to have completely yielded to BJP’s anti-Muslim agenda, cynically attempting to appease both sides,” Mehbooba alleged.She stressed that “the NC could learn” from Tamil Nadu’s DMK govt and the way in which it firmly opposed the Waqf bill. “In J&K, the only Muslim-majority region, it’s alarming that a supposedly people-centric govt lacks the courage even to debate this critical issue,” Mehbooba added. Mehbooba’s daughter Iltija Mufti echoed the views.Sajad Lone of People’s Conference hit out at Omar over the garden walk, saying the CM of the only Muslim-majority region in India should have stayed away from Rijiju. “Instead, he tagged along Farooq sahib as well. What a shame,” Lone said.Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, chairman of All Parties Hurriyat Conference, stressed the contrast with Tamil Nadu. “Tamil Nadu, which only has 6% Muslim population, passed a strong anti-Wakf resolution in its assembly. The assembly Speaker of Muslim majority-J&K is struggling and refusing by hiding behind technicalities to discuss it,” Mirwaiz said.",J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah went for morning walk in Srinagar’s famed Tulip Garden with Union minister Kiran Rijiju.

NEW DELHI: Chaos erupted at Sadaqat Ashram, the Bihar Congress office in Patna, following Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi's visit for a party function. Party workers drove away an individual, calling him thief and 'BJP agent.'The incident occurred on Monday at Sadaqat Ashram, where Rahul had stopped as part of his day-long tour that included a march in Begusarai and a symposium in Patna. While Rahul's visit to the venue lasted approximately 30 minutes, a video clip emerged of Congress workers chasing a man out of the office premises.After Rahul left, journalists noticed a young man carrying a pamphlet expressing support for the wakf bill. The man identified himself as ""Ram Babu Yadav, a native of Bhojpur district.""""He is a BJP agent, who has been sent here in exchange for money,"" alleged party workers as they forced Yadav out of the premises, labelling him as '' and ''.Later, one of the quarreling persons told reporters, ""I am a Congress supporter by birth. I am a Panchayat member. The one who was trading blows with me is an ex-MLA who is actually a BJP agent.""Former state president and Rajya Sabha MP Akhilesh Prasad Singh also got into the altercation, reportedly slapping a Congress worker on his way out.Two party workers blocked Singh's way while he was trying to reach his car. Singh stopped the fight by slapping one of them before leaving in his car.Rahul's day-long tour included multiple engagements across Bihar, including participation in a march at Begusarai and attending a symposium in Patna before concluding at the Congress headquarters.On his third visit to Bihar in four months, Rahul participated in the ""palayan roko, naukri do"" march in Begusarai, addressing unemployment and migration issues. Though he didn't speak publicly there, he was accompanied by numerous young supporters wearing white T-shirts, reminiscent of the ""Bharat Jodo Yatra"".At the ' Samvidhan Suraksha Sammelan ', Rahul said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had established a structure where 5% of the population governs the country, with 10-15 individuals controlling the corporate sector. Speaking at a symposium in the state capital before the assembly polls, he addressed the Congress alliance with RJD and the Left, which aims to challenge the ruling NDA.""I must be the first person in the Congress to admit that we did not work, in Bihar, with the zeal we should have. But we shall move forward learning from our mistakes. Our party, and the coalition of which we are a part, shall strive for uplift of SCs, STs, OBCs, extremely backward classes and minorities,"" said the Congress leader, noting his party's decline in Bihar since the 1990s Mandal wave.""We recently did something which may not have been great but was still of significance. We reconstituted District Congress Committees. Earlier, two-thirds of these were headed by upper castes. Now two-thirds of these are headed by the deprived castes. This has been in line with clear instructions from (national president Mallikarjun) Kharge ji and me for the organization,"" Rahul added.","Chaos erupted at Sadaqat Ashram, the Bihar Congress office in Patna.

Can arrange for jobs in other depts: Mamata

KOLKATA: Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee said on Monday that she was willing to risk jail to throw a lifeline to all ""eligible"" teaching and non-teaching employees of state-run schools whose jobs were on the line after Supreme Court's verdict last week on the SSC recruitment scam .She pledged to regularise these jobs within two months, assuring the affected employees at a meeting that she had a ""Plan A"" and ""Plan B"" ready, just in case.""Let SC clarify and give us the list of eligible and ineligible candidates. No one has the right to dismantle the education system. Who'll run these schools? My request is, do not take away jobs if you can't provide them. The education dept will do what is necessary,"" she said.I know I can be jailed for saying this, but I don't care. Standing with people in distress is my prime concern,"" she said , addressing a 7,000-strong gathering here, and advising those affected by the SC verdict to ""voluntarily"" continue working in their respective schools till they received termination notices. The CM said the Trinamool govt would ensure no ""eligible"" teacher or non-teaching staffer was affected by a ""service break"".""We will take whatever alternative action is necessary even if the verdict does not go in our favour. The process will be completed within two months; your service will not be interrupted and you will receive additional concessions,"" Mamata told them. ""We can arrange for jobs in other departments,"" she said without elaborating on the proposal. The CM said the School Service Commission would first seek a clarification from SC before filing a review petition for ""a modification of the verdict"".""We need to know what the court's explanation is before we conduct a fresh recruitment exam. There is no need for secrecy. We will act in accordance with law. We are bound by the SC ruling and are taking proactive steps to ensure that the situation is handled with utmost care and fairness...I have studied law and whatever I am saying is within the ambit of law."" The Bengal govt is in talks with a battery of senior SC advocates - Abhishek Manu Singhvi, Kapil Sibal, Rakesh Dwivedi, Kalyan Banerjee and Prashant Bhushan - to safeguard the rights of ""eligible"" teachers, the CM said.A liaison committee, including representatives of the affected school staff, will coordinate with the legal team. State education minister Bratya Basu met some school staffers later to set up the liaison committee.Mamata's speech was disrupted several times by members of the audience. She immediately sought to placate them. ""Let us first resolve the issue of 'eligible' teachers. Then I will review the evidence against those labelled 'ineligible'. Don't fight among yourselves till then; have faith in me,"" she said.The CM blamed CPM and BJP for the plight of those facing joblessness for no fault of theirs. ""Why did Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya (lawyer and CPM MP) file a case? Answers must be given. CPM must respond to this,"" she said.Mamata also referred to the Vyapam scam in BJP-governed Madhya Pradesh and the dismissal of around 10,000 teachers in Tripura during CPM's stint in govt there. ""Not a single teacher has been reinstated despite BJP's election manifesto promise to give back their jobs,"" she said.","Mamata Banerjee says she is willing to risk jail to throw a lifeline to all ""eligible"" teaching and non-teaching employees of state-run schools.
