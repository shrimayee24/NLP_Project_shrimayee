There has been an earlier strategy of BJP to replace candidates to neutralise their anti-incumbency. This was not seen this time.

parties of manufacturing poll issues out of nothing and said that Cong MP Rahul Gandhi shouldn’t have fled Battleground Amethi.Excerpts from the interview:■ There is a huge attraction towards (PM Narendra) Modiji. ‘Satisfied’ would be a big expression, but I want to say that people have a good feeling about the performance of the govt in the past 10 years. They are happy that the country’s stature has risen and its respect has increased internationally. Social welfare schemes have reached the people at the grassroots level with full honesty. The leakage and pilferages in the beneficiary schemes which was common earlier has completely ended. People are happy with all this.■ Pakka badhenge (Will rise for sure). Koi duvidha nahin hai (There is no ambiguity).■ This is all cooked up narrative. Sometimes it’s said Thakurs are unhappy, sometimes it’s Brahimns. There is nothing like this. Ek do logon ke naraz hone se qaum khilaf nahin hoti hai (Anger of a couple of people doesn’t reflect the sentiment of the entire community).■ Tickets are given only after assessing things on the ground. There might be some anger over some selections, but people have this common goal that the country should move forward.■ It’s not just a slogan. They (Congress) are not able to digest our firm march towards a 400-plus goal. Since Cong doesn’t have any issue, it’s making issues out of nothing.■ He should not have left the battleground. What do you call a person who flees the battleground?■ The govt is thinking about the welfare of the entire country. No section of the society will remain un touched. Development of every section will be done irrespective of caste, creed, or religion. Unless and until all are not developed, our dream of ‘Viksit Bharat’ will not be realised.■ We will definitely increase our tally in the first two rounds and there is no question of BJP turning the discourse communal. The beneficiary schemes which have reached to the grassroots level have not been done based on caste, creed, or religion.■ Hot weather is one reason. If there is lack of excitement it is mostly in the voters of the opposition. Supporters of opposition parties are hopeless. It’s because they have not been able to make a strong alliance as they had expected.■ I have travelled both in Tamil Nadu and Kerala. The party is sure to get seats in both the states. We are getting more seats even in Andhra and Telangana.This remains our commitment.■ These allegations are baseless. Opposition parties should desist from making such comments on the issues of border security and Army martyrs.■ Yes. I made similar statements around two years ago as well.■ Let him react. I do not have to say anything about his reaction. It is my firm belief that the way development work has begun in Jammu & Kashmir, the country is moving forward, people everywhere want such things to happen.",Defence minister Rajnath Singh is confident about a substantial rise in his party's tally.

Why everyone is talking about Pandian in Odisha,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-everyone-is-talking-about-pandian-in-odisha/articleshow/109931583.cms,"BHUBANESWAR: All of a sudden, the elections in Odisha seem to be revolving around VK Pandian , a Tamil Nadu-born former IAS officer of the Odisha cadre, who quit the service to join BJD and is now the party’s key campaigner and strategist. He is also being seen as CM Naveen Patnaik ’s political successor.Pandian has become the prime target of opposition leaders, right from PM Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah, BJP president JP Nadda to Congress’s Rahul Gandhi.Questions are being raised on how a non-Odia may take over the state’s reins if BJD returns to office. How Odia “asmita” (self-respect)” is in danger in a state formed on the basis of its language.In BJD, Pandian is among 40-star campaigners whose names figure in the list after Naveen. Flanked by party candidates, he occupies centre stage everywhere, even in meetings attended by Naveen.After joining the CM’s office as Naveen’s private secretary in 2011, Pandian’s efficiency caught the attention of Naveen. Soon enough, he was picked to be a ‘backroom boy’ to devise Naveen’s poll strategy for the 2014 and 2019 elections.Local BJP and Congress leaders had been raising the issue of extra-constitutional powers Pandian appeared to enjoy when he was the CM’s secretary till October last year. But as the 50-year-old took voluntary retirement and joined BJD, the “outsider” tag became the key talking point.But Pandian is unflappable. “I am an Indian by birth and Odia by breath. The mother tongue of my children is Odia and Odisha is my karmabhoomi (land where one works),” he said.On the issue of succeeding Naveen, Pandian said he considers himself a successor to Naveen’s values of impeccable integrity, absolute commitment to the people of Odisha and his hard work. He added that Naveen has always said the people of Odisha will decide his successor.Pandian, a 2000-batch IAS officer, was initially allotted the Punjab cadre. But barely a few months into his training, he got it changed to Odisha after marrying Sujata Rout, now Sujata R Karthikeyan, another IAS officer of the 2000-batch Odisha cadre. Sujata is from a village in Odisha’s Kendrapada district. On an Election Commission directive, she was recently transferred to a non-election related, non-public dealing post in the state finance department for alleged violation of poll code.Like his “guru” Naveen, who wears loose-fitting white kurta-pyjama and slippers when in public, Pandian is invariably seen in an untucked full-sleeve white shirt, and predominantly grey trousers at all his meetings.When alliance talks between BJP and BJD were going on in March, Pandian was the main negotiator for BJD, making several trips to Delhi.On Pandian’s rise, BJP’s Odisha face and Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan said it is not about a specific individual, but rather the subversion of established processes under Naveen’s leadership. “Democratic principles have been undermined and Odisha’s dignity disregarded. Mandate given to Naveen and BJD has been sidelined by the transfer of power to an unelected official,” he said.Cashing in on “Odia asmita,” BJP is hoping to have its first govt in Odisha and increase its 2019 Lok Sabha tally of 8 seats. In the last election, BJD had won 12 LS seats and Congress one. In the assembly polls, BJD had got 113 seats, BJP 23, Congress 9 and others 2.Leaving it to the people of Odisha to judge if he is an outsider, Pandian said BJP has no right to talk about Odia ‘asmita’, pointing out how a deserving Biju Patnaik – in fact, none from Odisha – was found suitable for a Bharat Ratna, while Odisha’s Paika revolt of 1817 was not given due recognition by BJP govt.Speculation is rife that Naveen, who has been contesting from two assembly seats — Hinjili and Kantabanji — may vacate one for Pandian.Political analysts feel Naveen (77), who is seeking a sixth term, has taken a calculated risk by elevating Pandian from the role of a backroom boy to a star campaigner. “If BJD does well, Pandian will get legitimacy and grow in stature. If it falters, the blame will fall on him because Naveen has never lost elections since he became CM for first time in 2000,” said Surya Nayaran Mishra, a retired professor of political science from Utkal University.“It’s a test case for electoral politics in Odisha as nothing similar has happened in the past,” said RK Satapathy, another retired professor of political science at North-Eastern Hill University. “If BJD does well, Naveen will make history by becoming the longest-serving CM within a few months. Pandian’s acceptability will also increase. For a large section of voters, content with freebies, who is at the helm doesn’t matter much. But I doubt if politically conscious people will accept him,” he said.", VK Pandian is a Tamil Nadu-born former IAS officer of the Odisha cadre. He quit the service to join BJD and is now the party’s key campaigner and strategist. He is also being seen as CM Naveen Patnaik ’s political successor.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109931601,imgsize-1830697,width-400,resizemode-4/109931601.jpg"

I cannot do anything now to stop corruption. I just made the start by filing my nomination. My fight will continue,” said Ghadai, a resident of Karimpur village.Ghadai, who has studied up to Class IX, came down heavily on the elected representatives for doing very little for the development of Brahmagiri in all these years.

Lucky Bhopal voters take home diamond rings,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/lucky-bhopal-voters-take-home-diamond-rings/articleshow/109927498.cms,"BHOPAL: Polling booth in Char Imli locality, where senior bureaucrats and ministers reside, has traditionally been a VIP polling booth in Bhopal. This time it was no different and the distinction where the crème de la crème vote was evident from the gifts offered to voters in lucky draw to boost voter turnout by the district administration . Balloons were put at different points outside the Char Imli booth to make the voting day look like a festival of democracy, a tent was also put up outside the booth to allow voters wait for their turn.Besides, drinking water and cooler were also arranged to ensure that voters at this VIP booth remain comfortable while voting.No wonder that at this booth, the gifts offered to winners in the lottery held for voters by the district administration was very different from that offered at the ordinary booths elsewhere in the city. While winners in the first lottery held at 10 am in other booths were offered a T-shirt or a water bottle, the first winner at Char Imli booth got a diamond ring and the second winner, a mixer and grinder. Water coolers and other gifts wrapped in shiny papers were stacked on a small platform outside the booth for the prospective winners in the subsequent draws.In fact, Bhopal district administration had offered gifts to three voters selected through the lottery drawn three times during the day — at 10 am, 2 pm and 6 pm to boost the turnout.A staff member on duty at a booth in Trilanga told TOI that the gifts on offer are a cap, T-shirt and water bottle. But, at Char Imli booth, Yaggoj Sahu was seen posing for photographs for the media with a diamond ring that he had won in the first lottery draw at 10 am. Another person who had won a mixer grinder was also there but as soon as Yaggoj Sahu’s name as winner of the diamond ring was announced, he was left in the oblivion.A visibly happy Sahu said that he didn’t want to participate in the draw, but his wife insisted that they should put their slips in the box. He said that it was an innovative scheme of the district administration and would definitely help in boosting voting in Bhopal constituency.When nodal officer, SVEEP, Rajesh Sharma, was asked how unlike in other booths, at Char Imli booth, winners in the draw are being given diamond ring and mixer, gifts supposed to be given in the bumper draw taking place next day after the polling, said that it was decided to have a bumper draw at some polling booths on the day of polling itself, then there will be a bumper draw comprising voters from all the polling booths from across the Bhopal constituency on May 9.Bhopal collector Kaushlendra Vikram Singh, when asked on the issue, said there were 5 diamond rings, 4 given at 1 booth each in all the 4 assembly segments of Bhopal today and the remaining one will be given in the bumper draw on Wednesday, when 200 gifts would be given to the winners.","Bhopal district administration had offered gifts to three voters selected through the lottery drawn three times during the day.

In this phase, Assam saw the highest turnout with 81.7%, according to data on the Election Commission ’s voter turnout app as of 11.45pm. The lowest was in 10 seats of Uttar Pradesh, where the turnout was 57.3%, as against 60% in 2019, followed by Bihar (58.2%) and Gujarat (59.2%). Polling was held for all the seats in Gujarat except Surat where the BJP candidate was elected unopposed.While the four seats in West Bengal saw 75.8% turnout, it was much lower than the 81.7% clocked five years ago.Poll analysts said the voting percentage in UP and Bihar was the lowest in all three phases. “That’s a matter of concern despite several efforts put by the EC,” said a source. Chhattisgarh, Karnataka and Goa saw an increase in turnout in the third phase.With the conclusion of phase three, polling is now over in 283 parliamentary constituencies across 20 states and UTs. “Though polling was till 6pm, voters were seen in the queue at many polling stations. Voters participated enthusiastically to cast their vote at their polling stations, braving hot weather conditions in some areas,” the EC said. It added the voting was smooth and peaceful. The three phases covered the entire north-east, LWE affected and vulnerable areas in Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh.Starting with the third phase, the poll panel has commenced a system of SMS alerts, WhatsApp messages and voice calls from national and state icons, with support from major telecom service providers, to encourage voter participation.EC said the data would be updated by field-level officers as polling parties keep returning and be available PC-wise live on VTR App. “As per the laid down procedure, scrutiny of election papers takes place one day after the polling day in the presence of candidates or their authorised polling agents. The decision to conduct repoll, if any, is also taken thereafter. Some polling parties return after polling day depending on the geographical/ logistical conditions,” it said.The EC also said that after the scrutiny and depending on the number and schedule of repoll, it will publish the updated voter turnout along with gender-wise breakup by May 11.","Voter turnout in the third phase of polling for 93 Lok Sabha seats on Tuesday touched 64.5%, compared with 66% in 2019.

'Fabric of society being torn apart'

NEW DELHI: The political slugfest over reservations took centrestage once again on Tuesday with Prime Minister Narendra Modi citing RJD chief Lalu Prasad 's pitch for Muslim quota to allege that a ""dangerous conspiracy of Congress and INDI alliance"" has been exposed. The opposition counter came from Sonia Gandhi who accused PM Modi and the BJP of promoting hatred for political gains.Prime Minister Narendra Modi latched on to Lalu's remarks that ""Muslims should get complete reservations"" to renew his attack that the opposition bloc wants to give complete reservation to Muslims by snatching it from the SCs, STs and OBCs.""Today, a senior leader of the INDI alliance who has eaten animal fodder, has been convicted by court in a corruption case and is out on bail due to health reasons is saying Muslims should not just get reservation but all the reservation should be given to Muslims. This means they want all the reservation to Muslims by snatching it from the SCs, STs and OBCs,"" PM Modi said at an election rally attacking the opposition alliance over Lalu's remarks.""Modi is asking for 400 seats so that the Congress does not hand over the country's vacant land and islands to other countries, it does not take away reservation given to SC/ST/OBCs and give it to its vote bank, and does not declare all castes of its vote bank as OBC overnight,"" he said.PM Modi had earlier also accused the Congress of distributing people’s property, land and gold among Muslims if the party was voted to power. He had then cited Congress’s promise to address the inequality of wealth and income in its manifesto and had linked it to an old statement of Manmohan Singh of minorities, especially Muslims, having the first right on nation's resources.The BJP also targeted the opposition over Lalu's remarks. ""This word, 'pura ka pura' (full), used by him in his statement, is very serious. This makes it clear that they (INDIA bloc) want to provide reservation to Muslims from the share of SCs, STs and OBCs,"" BJP national spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi said.With PM Modi and the BJP unleashing a fresh offensive on Muslim reservations , Lalu was quick to issue a clarification. Lalu Prasad said he was in favour of extending reservation benefits to Muslims but emphasised that it should be based on social backwardness and ""not on the basis of religion"". The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) supremo further claimed that it was he who had implemented the Mandal Commission.""I am senior to Narendra Modi (in politics). He does not know many things that I know. It was during my reign Mandal Commission recommendations were implemented (in Bihar). There are hundreds of social groups which got reservations as per the Mandal Commission report. But it was done not on the basis of religion. In the Constitution, there is no provision for reservations on religious basis"", Lalu Prasad said.However, it was former UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi who countered PM Modi's all-round offensive against the Congress and the opposition INDIA bloc. In a video message, the former UPA chairperson accused PM Modi and BJP of promoting hatred for political gains. Sonia alleged that fabric of society was being torn apart and expressed anguish at Constitution and democracy being under threat.Sonia claimed that youth unemployment, crimes against women and discrimination against Dalits, Adivasis, and minorities had reached unprecedented levels under the BJP government. These challenges, she claimed, stem from the ""niyat"" (intention) and ""niti"" (policy) of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP which aim for power, rejecting inclusivity and dialogue.The senior Congress leader appealed to the people to reject the proponents of lies and hatred and vote for her party for a ""brighter and more equal future"" for all. She said the Congress and the INDIA bloc members were committed to defending the Constitution and democracy.(With inputs from agencies)","Prime Minister Narendra Modi latched on to Lalu's remarks that ""Muslims should get complete reservations"" to renew his attack that the opposition bloc wants to give complete reservation to Muslims by snatching it from the SCs, STs and OBCs.

He has revealed the intention of Congress’s Shehzada (PM’s moniker for Rahul Gandhi in election rallies) to reverse Supreme Court’s decision on Ram Mandir as his father did in the Shah Bano case.”Elaborating the need for a heavy mandate for NDA, he said INDIA bloc plans to execute a “Mission Cancel” if elected to office by nullifying his govt’s decisions on issues like Article 370 and CAA.“Modi is asking for 400 seats so that Congress does not hand over the country’s vacant land and islands to other countries; it does not take away reservation given to SCs/STs/OBCs and give it to its vote bank, and does not declare all castes of its vote bank as OBCs overnight,” he said.The PM countered Congress’s accusation that BJP wants to change the Constitution, saying: “It’s only because of the power of Indian Constitution that the people of India rejected namdar (dynast) and elected a kamdar (workaholic) and this is why Congress hates Baba Saheb (Dr Ambedkar).”Modi said the country was at an important turning point of the history, where the voters had to choose between “vote-jihad and Ram-Rajya”.

There was a 1.3% drop in Bhopal despite diamond rings being handed out in voter lottery draws. Betul saw the sharpest drop of 4.7%.Rajgarh, where sitting BJP MP Rodmal Nagar is being challenged by Congress stalwart Digvijaya Singh, recorded the highest polling at 76.2%, followed by Vidisha (74.2%), where former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan is returning to the Lok Sabha arena after 18 years. Guna, where aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia of BJP and Congress's Rao Yadvendra Singh Yadav are locked in battle, reported 72.4% polling.S cindia is looking for redemption in the seat he lost to a former aide in 2019.Betul saw 73.4% polling, Sagar 65.7%, Bhopal 64.3%, Gwalior 62.3%, Morena 58.6% and Bhind 55.4%.Barring minor skirmishes, elections were held peacefully across the state. State chief electoral officer Anupam Rajan said, ""There was a dispute between two groups in Bhind constituency but police controlled the situation"".A youth was also shot and injured in Bhind but Rajan said it wasn't related to polls but an old enmity. In Morena, the candidates of all three major parties were kept at the police lines till late afternoon.There was a rumour in Badol polling booth of Chachora in Guna that 11 votes were polled but 50 was shown on the EVM. Officials verified it and found it wasn't so, Rajan said.Officials said 104 ballot units, 98 control units and 164 VVPATs were changed during mock polls.

The final figure is likely to remain close to the voter turnout of 71.79% reported in 2019 elections. The constituency has remained stronghold of BJP for nearly four decades now. Former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan who is in fray has represented the constituency for five times. Congress candidate from Vidisha, Pratap Bhanu Sharma who is in the fray against BJP's Shivraj Singh Chouhan had also represented the constituency twice in 1980 and 1984.

This completes the NA’s total strength of 336 seats.In March, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had ruled that SIC was not eligible for reserved seats and decided to distribute the seats among other parliamentary parties, with the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) becoming major beneficiaries. The verdict was rejected by PTI as unconstitutional and the alliance had filed a plea against the electoral watchdog’s decision in the Peshawar HC, but it rejected the appeal.In response, SIC moved the Supreme Court last month urging it to allot the party the reserved seats in the national and provincial assemblies and set aside the Peshawar HC ruling.Accepting SIC’s appeal for a hearing, the apex court clarified that the Peshawar HC order upholding ECP’s decision was suspended to the extent of the remaining reserved seats distributed among other parties.After losing the extra reserved seats, PM Shehbaz Sharif’s coalition government had lost its two-thirds majority in the National Assembly.","Pakistan’s Supreme Court suspended on Monday a high court verdict that a political party was not eligible for reserved seats for women and minorities.

Politically dominated by Pasis , followed by Yadavs , Muslims , Jatavs, Thakurs, Brahmins, and Kurmis, Mohanlalganj has seen shifting political allegiances over the years.In 2019, Kaushal Kishore secured victory by overcoming the challenge posed by the SP-BSP alliance , clinching a victory with a substantial margin of 90,204 votes.With a significant presence of Muslims and Yadavs in the constituency, traditionally aligned with the SP, and BSP retaining its Dalit voter base , and Kishore hailing from the Pasi community, the stage is set for an interesting battle ahead.Political analysts predict that the consolidation of non-Dalit votes has been pivotal in determining the results and this will be again tested in 2024. The first election in the constituency took place in 1962. So far, 15 elections have been held in the constituency. From 1962 to 1977, Congress won from this seat five times and thrice consistently from 1962 to 1977 and then Janata Party won once in 1977.BJP won in 1991 and then in 1996. However, thereafter, from 1998 to 2009 the seat remained with the Samajwadi Party. In 2014, BJP wrestled back the seat. While initially Congress maintained its dominance in this constituency, political dynamics shifted in subsequent elections and BJP and SP emerged as key players. BSP, despite having a significant SC vote share, has struggled to capture this seatCongress relied on the combination of Dalit-Muslim and upper caste votes for its victory here. Like elsewhere, the assertion of backward caste politics led to the defeat of Congress in the 1989 by Janata Dal. This was again largely a consolidation of non-Dalit votes in favour of a winning party.In the 1990s and afterwards, the constituency emerged as the strongholds of the BJP and the SP. From 1991 until 1998, BJP held this seat. In the election of 1998, SP won the seat and retained it until 2009. In 2014, BJP gave the ticket to popular Left Party's candidate Kaushal Kishore and secured this seat. BSP never won this seat despite having the highest proportion of SC votes in the constituency.","Mohanlalganj is a reserved parliamentary seat spanning Lucknow and Sitapur districts.

Raut is aiming at a hat-trick from the seat.Another important seat in the region was Solapur, where former Union minister Sushilkumar Shinde's daughter Praniti Shinde is pitted against the BJP's Ram Satpute. The constituency logged 57.6% turnout.In Madha, the battle between BJP sitting MP Ranjeetsingh Naik Nimbalkar and former BJP leader Dhairyasheel Mohite Patil, who joined the NCP (SP) just before his nomination, witnessed a 62.2% turnout.Over 100 polling booths in the 11 constituencies recorded glitches in the electronic voting machines (EVMs), holding up the polling process for about 30-40 minutes, a senior election official said. The officials said Madha, Satara and Raigad constituencies faced the maximum glitches, following which ballot units (BU), control units (CU) and VVPAT machines were replaced immediately.The fate of both Supriya Sule of the NCP (SP) and deputy CM Ajit Pawar's wife Sunetra Pawar of the NCP was sealed on Tuesday, a little over five months after Ajit Pawar for the first time announced that his party would field a candidate against Sule, who is his cousin.As expected, the Baramati constituency remained at the centre of attraction as NCP (SCP) chief Sharad Pawar, Ajit Pawar and other members of the family, along with Sule and Sunetra, cast their votes in the morning. The rest of the day remained eventful following complaints of ""cash for votes"" and ""threat messages"" from various areas across the constituency. After casting his vote, Ajit Pawar said, ""I had joined Mahayuti govt for the cause of development. Mahayuti will win in the state","Baramati recorded 56.1% voter turnout on Tuesday, nearly 6% lower than that in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The constituency went to the polls in the third phase of general elections with 10 other seats in Maharashtra. Besides Baramati, Raigad, Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg, Satara, Kolhapur, Madha, Solapur, Osmanabad, Latur, Hatkangale and Sangli went to polls.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109933777,imgsize-1112386,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/109933777.jpg"
Muslims: Polarisation remains major peeve for minorities,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/lok-sabha-elections/delhi/news/polarisation-remains-major-peeve-for-minorities/city/delhi/polarisation-remains-major-peeve-for-minorities/articleshow/109929643.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a shop in Sri Ram Colony in northeast Delhi , 32-year-old Abrar sips a cold drink to beat the heat. A cloud of dust blows and disturbs him. The locality, which is predominantly inhabited by Muslim families, has dilapidated roads, uncovered manholes and mounds of garbage. The sewer lines are overflowing and emanate a foul odour.“Every day, we struggle with clogged drains, overflowing garbage and defunct streetlights,” said Abrar, an executive in a private firm.Yet these conditions haven’t yet forced his voting preference. He said he would make his decision closer to the date.In the various neighbourhoods, TOI found the Muslims, like Abrar, keeping their cards close to their chest. With the community accounting for around 12.9% of Delhi’s population as per Census 2011, political parties crave their support in the Lok Sabha polls . Though the North East Delhi Lok Sabha constituency has the highest percentage of Muslims voters at 20.7%, others also have a sizeable number. Chandni Chowk has 14%, East Delhi 16.8%, New Delhi 16.8%, North West Delhi 10.6%, South Delhi 7% and West Delhi 6.8%. Among the major political parties, however, only Bahujan Samaj Party has fielded a Muslim candidate: Abdul Kalam Azad in Chandni Chowk.Sitting on a wooden plank in Joharipur, affected by communal riots in 2020, Mohammad Mushtaq, 66, said he would vote for Congress candidate Kanhaiya Kumar in North East Delhi. “We felt troubled by the cow vigilantism cases. However, unemployment is a problem for both Muslims and Hindus,” said Mushtaq. “Notification of the Citizen’s (Amendment) Act will not reap any benefits for BJP. And though triple talaq has been scrapped, it has not ended divorce and people are adopting legal routes to end their marriages.”His neighbour, Mohammad Anish Ansari, 42, who runs a bed linen business, believes that CAA was notified just before the polls to polarise voters. “We are aware that BJP leaders are passing remarks about the Muslims community to divide votes,” he said. Ansari too said he would vote for Kumar because he was educated and would likely usher in positive change in the area.At the tyre market in Gokalpuri, which was devastated by the 2020 riots and then the Covid lockdown, there has been a gradual recuperation, according to Nazar Mohammed, the market secretary. “During the riots, 50% of the shops were burnt down, 20% were looted. We took loans to rebuild what we lost,” he said. He identified finance and inflation as the primary challenges to business and the factors that would influence their vote. With business having reduced, employment has been hit. Mohammed himself chopped his staff strength from 10 to just one.In Shaheen Bagh, the globally acknowledged ground zero of the CAA-NRC protests in 2020, there was mixed notification of voting preferences. While welcoming CAA, property dealer Syed Nazmi Habib, 47, said, “Our biggest opposition is to the division of Hindu and Muslim communities for cheap political returns. People now consider each other with suspicion, even hatred. This is creating panic because it impacts life and business.”Shabana, a housewife in Mustafabad, declared she would vote for the development of her locality, which has no community centre, potholed roads and traffic congestion. Nawab, 70, a shopkeeper in Old Delhi, was certain BJP would win the May 25 contest because “they have done some work”.Tasleem Ahmad, who owns a tour and travel business in Old Delhi, expressed disillusionment with the political system and intended to press the None of the Above (NOTA) button. ""The elected leaders don't work for the public. They make promises but never deliver. They consistently fail to fulfil their commitments to the common people,” he explained.Political analyst Chandrachur Singh, associate professor in political science at Hindu College, observed, “Though the Muslims are not vocal about their voting strategy, I have this perception that they will vote en bloc for the INDIA candidates. It’s obvious that they are not comfortable with BJP, which the party is well aware of.” He pointed out that in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls in Delhi, the fight was three-cornered among BJP, Congress and AAP. “This year, there is a bipolar contest between BJP and INDIA. To some degree, the indecisive element no longer exists,” he added.","Muslim community accounting for around 12.9% of Delhi’s population as per Census 2011.

We don't want you to run govt if given bail due to polls: SC to CM Arvind Kejriwal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/we-dont-want-you-to-run-govt-if-given-bail-due-to-polls-sc-to-cm-arvind-kejriwal/articleshow/109932335.cms,"Court shouldn’t treat politicians as separate class for interim relief: SG

NEW DELHI: Amid opposition from ED, which said granting interim bail to Arvind Kejriwal would send the wrong message that some accused were more equal before the law, Supreme Court on Tuesday reserved its order and observed the PMLA case linked to the alleged excise policy scam concerned ""extraordinary situations"" where the accused was an elected CM and not a ""habitual offender or somebody involved in many other cases"".However, the court told the CM, ""Suppose we grant interim bail on account of elections. Then if you say you will attend office, it may have a cascading effect. We don't want you performing official duties as... it will lead to conflict (of interest). It's not a matter of legality but of propriety.""Meanwhile, a Delhi court extended Kejriwal's judicial custody till May 20.SC said it has to consider interim relief, if at all, as it was not possible to conclude hearing and deliver judgment on Kejriwal’s plea challenging his arrest before May 17 when the court goes into summer recess and Delhi votes on May 25.Taking cue from the observation of the SC bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Datta, senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for Kejriwal, instantly assured the court that he would not sign any document after coming out of jail but the Delhi lieutenant governor should also not return files for lack of his signature.Opposing the proposal for interim relief, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said the court should not treat politicians as a separate class for interim relief as it would demoralise common people like workers, farmers and labourers who would think the law is favourable to those who hold high posts.""All are equal before law and the message should not go that some are more equal. Do not earmark politicians as a separate class,"" Mehta said. He added that a wrong perception was being created that Kejriwal was arrested just before the election but the fact was that he had defied nine summons issued by ED and derailed the probe for six months. Mehta said a farmer could ask for interim relief for harvesting.""Look, there are 2-3 issues...one is, he is an elected chief minister. The elections are round the corner. These are extraordinary situations. He is not otherwise a habitual offender, or somebody who has been involved in many other cases... and elections are held once in five years. It's not like harvesting after every six months,"" the bench said.Mehta said hundreds of politicians were in jail but no politician had so far been released on bail for election campaigning. ""Arvind Kejriwal was not picked up suddenly because of elections. He was summoned by ED since last six months. Kejriwal was not appearing before ED under pretexts like going for meditation etc. Still, ED did not directly pick him up and approached the court. Six months were wasted by Kejriwal and, therefore, he was arrested belatedly,"" he added.The court clarified that it had been granting interim relief in many cases, even in those involving heinous offences and it was considering Kejriwal's plea not because he was a politician. It referred to SC's verdict granting relief to journalist Arnab Goswami.""Let it be very clear that we are not going by whether he is a politician or not. We are only considering whether the person falls under special circumstances in view of the election,"" the bench said. It added that the CM was entitled to say that he was arrested just before the election as his name first cropped up in the case in Feb 2023.",Supreme Court reserved its order and observed the PMLA case linked to the alleged excise policy scam.

BENGALURU: Braving the scorching summer sun and heatwave, voters of north and central Karnataka turned out in their numbers to vote in the second phase of Lok Sabha elections helping the state register a 70.4% turnout in 14 seats on Tuesday that catapulted the cumulative figures for the two phases of polling to 69.9% - the best ever for the state since electioneering began in 1951.Of the 14 seats that went to the polls in the 2nd phase, Chikkodi, with 76.9% polling had the best figures. This seat had also recorded the highest voter turnout of 75.5% in 2019.Gulbarga, which recorded a maximum temperature of around 43°C on Tuesday, saw the lowest turnout among the 14 parliamentary seats, with only 61.7% voters exercising their franchise.The final figures for the 14 segments in north Karnataka defied all expectations and proved many a pundit wrong as there were concerns that the turnout may be lower compared to 2019, primarily in view of the heatwave sweeping across the state.The turnout not only surpassed the stats for the last three Lok Sabha elections, but was also close to the significant 70% turnout milestone.The state has a total of 28 Lok Sabha constituencies. The first phase of polling for 14 seats in the southern and coastal districts on April 26 had recorded a 69.5% turnout. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the state's 28 seats had recorded a 68.8% voter turnout. Overall, polling remained peaceful in the second phase, with only minor incidents of violence reported, including stone-pelting in Shorapur (Surapur) that left one person injured.No major violence was reported in the second phase of polls in the state, Manoj Kumar Meena, the Chief Electoral Officer of Karnataka, said.While voter turnout in north Karnataka outshone that of the southern and coastal constituencies, Mandya, which went to polls in the first phase, retained its lead in terms of voter participation with a 81.1% turnout.In 2019, Raichur had recorded the lowest polling with 58.3% voters turning out, but it came up with a marginally improved showing this time around with 61.8% voters turning out to vote.In comparison, Bangalore Central, the IT-BT capital of the country, recorded barely 54% turnout and was the lowest among all the 28 seats in the state this time.Meanwhile, Shorapur (Surapur), the sole assembly seat that had bypolls due to the death of sitting Congress MLA Raja Venkatappa Naik, registered 66.7% polling.","Voters of north and central Karnataka turned out in their numbers to vote in the second phase of Lok Sabha elections.
