NEW DELHI: Calling PM Narendra Modi pure like the holy water of the Ganga, BJP Wednesday hit out at Congress MP Rahul Gandhi for his denunciation of the ""Gujarat model"" and accused the Gandhi family of being the most corrupt and ""chor parivar (family of thieves)"" in the country.BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia's attack on Rahul came after he alleged during his public meetings in Bihar that the Gujarat model, projected as a showpiece for growth when Modi was the state's chief minister, was ""all about vote chori"". ""If there is one family that is the most corrupt and 'chor' (thief), then it is the 'nakli' (fake) Gandhi family. Sonia Gandhi , Robert Vadra and Rahul Gandhi are out on bail in corruption cases."" Bhatia also reminded Rahul how his ""chowkidar chor hai"" slogan against Modi had backfired. Modi is ""pure like the Gangajal"" as he is fully dedicated to the service of people, Bhatia said, as he criticised Rahul for levelling an unfounded allegation and using tasteless language against the PM.","BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia's attack on Rahul came after he alleged during his public meetings in Bihar that the Gujarat model was ""all about vote chori"" ""If there is one family that is the most corrupt and 'chor' (thief), then it is the 'nakli' (fake) Gandhi family,"" he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123554687,imgsize-1637923,width-400,resizemode-4/123554687.jpg"

5 Kerala ex-police officers acquitted in custodial death case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/5-kerala-ex-police-officers-acquitted-in-custodial-death-case/articleshow/123554212.cms,".

KOCHI: Kerala high court Wednesday acquitted five former police officers, including one who was sentenced to death by a trial court in the Udayakumar custodial murder case. The murder took place at Thiruvananthapuram’s Fort Police Station in 2005.A bench of Justices V Raja Vijayaraghavan and K V Jayakumar set aside the conviction and sentences of former ASI K Jithakumar, former crime branch DSP T Ajith Kumar, retired SP E K Sabu and retired ACP T K Haridas, citing serious lapses in the CBI investigation. Jithakumar and S V Sreekumar had been awarded the death penalty by a CBI special court, while the others were sentenced to three years’ imprisonment. Sreekumar died in 2020, during the pendency of the appeal, while another accused, Soman, had died pending trial.According to the prosecution, P Udayakumar, a 28-year-old man, was picked up by Jithakumar and Sreekumar at around 2.15am on Sept 27, 2005, while with a friend at Sreekanteswaram Park. A sum of Rs 4,000 was recovered from him, and he was taken to Fort Police Station, and then to the circle inspector’s office nearby where he was allegedly subjected to custodial violence. He was later declared dead at the medical college hospital.The prosecution claimed his death resulted from torture in custody.The initial CB-CID probe arraigned only three officers as accused, but the trial faltered as most prosecution witnesses turned hostile. Udayakumar’s mother then moved the HC, which ordered a CBI probe. CBI arraigned eight more police officers as accused; on the same day, their applications seeking pardons were filed before court. Pardon was granted on the condition that they make full and true disclosure of all facts and circumstances. CBI later filed its final report, naming six officers as accused. The trial court convicted and sentenced them, leading to the appeals before the HC.The bench held that CBI committed a serious illegality by filing its final report before a magistrate’s court in a case already committed to a sessions court, thereby violating the right of the accused to a fair trial. The procedure adopted in seeking pardons before the chief judicial magistrate was also found to be ex facie illegal and contrary to mandatory provisions of CrPC.","Kerala high court acquitted five former police officers, including one who was sentenced to death by a trial court in the Udayakumar custodial murder case.

'Talks Are On With...': Rahul’s Wedding Remark After Tejashwi’s Tip Sparks Political Banter In Bihar

Poll Do you believe the government's response to the SSC protests was justified? Yes, they acted appropriately No, it was excessive

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday hit out at the Centre over the alleged lathicharge on Staff Selection Commission (SSC) aspirants and trainers protesting at Delhi’s Ramlila Maidan. He accused the Modi government of ignoring the concerns of the youth, alleging it had come to power by “stealing votes. ”In a post in Hindi on X, Gandhi said the lathicharge on SSC aspirants and teachers peacefully protesting at Ramlila Maidan was “not just shameful, but the hallmark of a cowardly government.”The protest, held on Sunday, saw the participation of several SSC candidates and their trainers, who were demanding transparency and better conduct of recruitment examinations. The SSC exams have faced repeated complaints of abrupt cancellations, server crashes, unresponsive systems and exam centres located as far as 500 kilometres from candidates’ homes.“The youth had only demanded their rights — employment and justice. What did they get? Lathis,” Gandhi said.He alleged that the government first manipulated elections to secure votes, then allowed irregularities in examinations, followed by failures in providing jobs and ultimately sought to suppress citizens’ rights and voices.The Congress leader further said the government does not prioritise the demands of youth, farmers, the poor, Dalits and minorities, as it does not depend on their votes. He urged people not to be afraid but to stand firm and fight back.Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge also condemned the alleged police action, claiming the Modi government had made it a “habit” to jeopardise the future of the youth.“Stealing the future of the country’s youth has become a habit of the Modi government. The brutal lathi-charge by the Modi government’s puppet police on students protesting against rigging in SSC exams at Delhi’s Ramlila Maidan is highly condemnable,” Kharge said in a post on X.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra too criticised the government, calling the use of force on protesting students “inhuman and shameful.”In her post on X, she said, “The youth of the entire country are troubled by rigging in every exam, scams in every recruitment and paper leaks. The corruption in the recruitment process and exams under the BJP rule is ruining the future of the youth.”Denying the allegations, a senior Delhi Police officer said around 1,500 protestors had gathered at the site, and about 100 refused to leave after the permitted time despite repeated requests.“Out of those who were not leaving, 44 protestors were detained. There was no lathi-charge,” the officer clarified.The SSC is a statutory body responsible for conducting recruitment examinations for various posts across ministries, departments and other government organisations.The Phase 13 exam, held between July 24 and August 1 at 194 centres in 142 cities, faced multiple disruptions. Approximately five lakh candidates appeared for the examination during this period.These issues sparked widespread protests across Delhi last week, drawing thousands of aspirants to the streets and triggering a strong backlash on social media.",Rahul Gandhi hits out at the Centre over the alleged lathicharge on Staff Selection Commission (SSC) aspirants and trainers protesting at Delhi’s Ramlila Maidan.
