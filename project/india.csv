Rekha Gupta to be Delhi CM: Frontrunners lose race again as BJP picks first-time MLA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rekha-gupta-is-delhi-cm-bjp-surprises-again-picks-first-time-mla-over-heavyweights/articleshow/118393944.cms,"Rekha Gupta will be the only woman chief minister among the states being ruled by the BJP at present.

She enjoys close ties with the RSS and is actively engaged with women-related matters.

Gupta is also the national vice president of BJP Mahila Morcha and a member of the party's national executive.

She is a former president of the Delhi University Students' Union (DUSU) and a civic body councillor.

Rekha Gupta entered politics as an Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) member in 1992.

NEW DELHI: Another state, another surprise pick. The BJP has done it again. On Wednesday, the BJP, which returned to power in Delhi after 27 long years, picked first-time MLA Rekha Gupta as its chief minister. While the announcement ended days of suspense and speculation, it did reinforce the notion that being a heavyweight or a frontrunner for the top post in any BJP-ruled state is actually a disadvantage.The likes of Parvesh Verma , Vijender Gupta - party's old warhorses in Delhi, would perhaps have known the disadvantages of being frontrunners in this race even as they would have hoped for an exception from the party high command.When it comes to selecting chief ministers, the BJP's script has been the same - state after state. Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Odisha, Gujarat, Haryana - all these BJP-ruled states have chief ministers who were relatively unknown figures in the party till they were picked to lead the state. The heavyweights and the frontrunners in these states lost the race to the top post.With Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself leading the campaign in all state elections, the BJP uses CM pick keeping in mind long-term gains for the party.Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, Goa CM Pramod Sawant and Uttarakhand's Pushkar Singh Dhami are some of the BJP chief ministers who could buck the trend and continue with the top post after the party's victory.To that extent, Rekha Gupta should consider herself lucky as her name was also doing the rounds for the top post in Delhi. A number of factors could have helped Rekha Gupta pip the heavyweights, who played crucial role in BJP's victory.Immediately after the formal announcement, the Delhi CM-designate thanked the top BJP leadership for reposing confidence in her. ""I thank the top leadership from my heart for its belief in me for entrusting me with the post of Chief Minister. This faith and support have evoked a new energy and motivation in me. I pledge to strive with total honesty, commitment and dedication for the welfare of the residents of Delhi. I am fully committed to the significant responsibility of taking Delhi to a new pinnacle,"" she said in a post on X in Hindi.",Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) picks first woman as its chief minister.

MYSURU: Lokayukta Police gave a clean chit Wednesday to Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah , his wife Parvathi and two other co-accused in the Mysuru Urban Development Authority (Muda) land-swap case, saying the charges levelled by petitioner Snehamayi Krishna against them ""could not be substantiated"".However, Siddaramaiah, for whom the case posed a challenge to his pre-eminence within the state Congress, apparently isn't out of the woods yet. ED is separately investigating laundering charges linked to the CM's wife allegedly benefiting from preferential allotment of 14 plots within Mysuru city by Muda in exchange for land on the outskirts.Lokayukta’s inquiry report will be submitted Thursday to the special MP/MLAs’ court in Bengaluru, where a hearing is scheduled for Feb 24.Mysuru Lokayukta SP and investigation officer TJ Udesha said a notice had been issued to petitioner Krishna, giving him a week to file objections. The notice, whose contents Krishna shared with the media, states that the investigation didn’t throw up any evidence to implicate CM Siddaramaiah, his wife and others named in case.The activist dismissed the probe report as “pre-planned drama”, saying Lokayukta never bothered to cross-check any of its findings with him. “I visited Lokayukta office only to hand over the documents I had collected. My fight will continue. I will file objections,” he said.According to the Sept 27 FIR registered under IPC, Prevention of Corruption Act, Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act and Karnataka Land-Grabbing Prohibition Act, Parvathi received 14 prime plots in Mysuru’s Vijayanagar under the 50:50 Muda scheme. She returned the 14 plots to Muda after the case was filed.CM Siddaramaiah was accused of conspiring to get ownership of the 14 sites in the heart of Mysuru in his wife’s name in exchange for 3 acres, 16 guntas of land at Kesare on the city’s outskirts. The FIR named the CM, his wife, brother-in-law BM Mallikarjuna Swamy and land owner J Devaraju. After an investigation spanning 138 days, Lokayukta compiled a nearly 1,000-page report containing statements of more than 100 serving and retired Muda officers, politicians, Muda commissioner and tahsildar, among others.Lokayukta Police clarified that further investigation into Muda’s compensatory plot allocations between 2016 and 2024 was underway.

Her name had been proposed by MLAs Parvesh Verma, Satish Upadhyay and Vijender Gupta — all probable candidates for the coveted job before the central brass announced its decision.Saxena greeted her with a bouquet and gave BJP the green signal for the swearing-in ceremony to be held at Ramlila Maidan on Thursday noon.Gupta was accompanied to Raj Niwas by Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva and central observers for conducting the legislature party meet, Ravi Shankar Prasad and Om Prakash Dhankhar.""I want to thank Prime Minister Narendra Modi, our party's top leadership and people of Delhi for giving me the responsibility to preside over a new era that is starting in Delhi after 27 years.

The MLAs started arriving at 6 pm with the meeting beginning around 7 pm and lasting for an hour.Outside the venue, supporters of senior party functionaries and claimants to the top job, besides media personnel, had gathered in large numbers long before the meeting began. The supporters were shouting slogans in favour of their preferred choice, particularly Rekha Gupta and Parvesh Verma, in a show of strength.Party sources said Delhi BJP Chief Virendra Sachdeva had a private discussion with Verma, Vijender Gupta and Upadhyay. Parvesh defeated AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal; Upadhyay has previously served as the party's state chief; and Vijender Gupta had managed to buck the trend by winning in the assembly polls in 2015 and 2020 in the face of an AAP wave.According to party sources, they are all being considered for important positions, including that of ministers, speaker and other posts.When Verma came out of the meeting, he was asked if he was being considered for the post of deputy CM but he did not reply. ""We are going to the LG's office. It is a matter of happiness that a woman has been made CM,"" he said.Most MLAs who emerged from the legislature party meeting stressed on the party's decision to appoint a woman CM, highlighting its dedication to women empowerment . Party functionaries said she fulfilled three crucial criteria: that of being a woman, belonging to the Bania community and maintaining a low-key public profile. This is in keeping with the recent trend of the party going for relatively low-profile leaders for the chief minister's role as evident in other states.BJP MP from South Delhi Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, who had drafted the party's manifesto, said after the meeting: ""She will prove to be the best chief minister of Delhi. The party has always been a pioneer in women empowerment, and this is another example of that. Delhi will now become the developed and prosperous capital of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi's dreams.""MP Manoj Tiwari, who was also present at the meeting, said, ""This is a message for women empowerment.
