Nabanna Abhijan Rally illegal, says West Bengal ADGP; BJP calls it 'spineless police force'

NEW DELHI: All India Trinamool Congress on Monday accused the Bhartiya Janta Party of planning to orchestrate ruckus during the ""apolitical"" Nabanna Abhiyan rally scheduled for August 27. The saffron party reacted to this saying that Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee would single-handedly be responsible for any violence at the rally.TMC also alleged the saffron party of playing ""vulture politics"" over the students' protest in a bid ""to plunge Bengal into chaos.""The rally has been organised by ‘ Chhatra Samaj or Student Society’ in the backdrop of rape and murder of doctor at RG Kar College and Hospital in Kolkata.TMC posted a video of a person who is heard saying that the rally is not meant to ""peaceful"". ""Gun shots will be fired; rubber bullets will be fired,"" the English subtitles suggest as the person is supposedly talking to a reporter. TOI could not verify the authenticity of the video.""'Dead bodies must fall' for 'political momentum.' - SHOCKING videos have emerged indicating a sinister conspiracy behind the Nabanna Abhiyan tomorrow! BJP has resorted to the politics of DEAD BODIES under the camouflage of JUSTICE! Instead of asking CBI to expedite the probe, this is what the BJP is busy doing,"" the post accompanying the video reads.Calling it a ""well choreographed"" video, BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya said, ""Mamata Banerjee thinks such juvenile antics are going to deter people from seeking justice for the RG Kar victim and her resignation? NO. It strengthens our resolve even more.""Now, the TMC official handle has put out a well choreographed, edited and subtitled video, indicating violence on 27th and trying to blame the BJP for it,"" he said.Asserting that the ""apolitical student protest will go on"", Malviya said, ""It has support of entire West Bengal. Mamata Banerjee alone will be responsible for ANY violence.""West Bengal ADG Police (Law & Order) Manoj Kumar Verma said that Nabanna Abhijan rally was illegal, adding that it was an attempt to incite widespread unrest in Kolkata. He said that Nabanna is a restricted area, and no organization has applied for permission to hold a protest near the state secretariat.Launching a sharp attack on the state police, Amit Malviya said that since the rally has been announced, it has given ""sleepless nights to Mamata Banerjee and her spineless police force"".""Then WB Police put out a note expressing apprehensions regarding the UGC-NET exam. It is their responsibility to ensure exams happen on schedule. But the BJP has announced a student helpline for assistance, since WB Police is incompetent and is freezing in their boots,"" he said.The Bengal ADGP said that while peaceful protests are permitted in specific designated areas of Kolkata, such as those related to incidents like the one at RG Kar Medical College, Nabanna remains off-limits for demonstrations. This is due to the enforcement of Section 163 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023, which replaces the former Section 144 of the CrPC.","All India Trinamool Congress accused Bhartiya Janta Party of planning to orchestrate ruckus during the ""apolitical"" Nabanna Abhiyan rally scheduled for August 27.
