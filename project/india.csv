Cong-ress netas Mallikarjun Kharge, Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi paid tribute to Gandhi.Citing the second volume of the book by Gandhi’s secretary Pyarelal, ‘Mahatma Gandhi: The Last Phase’, spokesperson Jairam Ramesh said the description of RSS as a communal body came in his conversation with a colleague on Sept 12, 1947, and five months later, then Union home minister Sardar Patel banned RSS.Ramesh said Patel, on Dec 16, 1948, spoke at the Congress session in Jaipur. “He warned that any organisation which sought to supplant the national flag by another would be sternly dealt with,” stated a report, attached in his X post.","Mahatma Gandhi called RSS a ‘communal body with totalitarian outlook’, Congress said.

Honourable acquittal different from acquittal over benefit of doubt: HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/honourable-acquittal-different-from-acquittal-over-benefit-of-doubt-hc/articleshow/124278826.cms,"Generative AI

BENGALURU: Karnataka HC has overturned a state administrative tribunal’s reinstatement of a village accountant removed from his job over bribery allegations, distinguishing between an “honourable acquittal and one secured on benefit of doubt”.HC concluded that the tribunal shouldn’t have considered acquittal in the criminal case under benefit of doubt, noting the burden of proving misconduct lies with the employer in departmental proceedings.Shivanagouda Vasanad was compulsorily retired after a departmental inquiry found the charges correct. The accountant in Bagalkot district was caught in Nov 2011 accepting Rs 2,500 for executing a mutation entry. In May 2021, a special court acquitted Vasanad in the criminal case.Subsequently, he approached Karnataka State Administrative Tribunal, which rescinded his compulsory retirement in April 2023. Govt appealed in HC, asserting the tribunal’s consideration of the acquittal, which was not an honourable one, was improper since the departmental inquiry had proved the charges.","Karnataka HC has overturned a state administrative tribunal’s reinstatement of a village accountant removed from his job over bribery allegations.

PATNA: Former Bihar minister Tej Pratap Yadav , whom his father Lalu Prasad recently expelled from the RJD , on Thursday asked his younger brother Tejashwi Yadav to show him the respect that Lord Rama had got from Laxman .The Hasanpur MLA, who has now floated his own party, Jan Shakti Janata Dal, was asked about Tejashwi's charge that while in the RJD, he used to get close aides fielded as rebel candidates.The mercurial leader snapped, ""Being the younger brother, he should act with a sense of propriety (maryada) just like Laxman did in the case of Ram. He is getting misled by people comparable to Jaichand"".While in RJD, Tej Pratap had a running feud with his younger brother's close aides like Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Yadav, whom he has been likening to Jaichand, an early medieval period Hindu king who is said to have assisted Afghan invader Muhammad Ghori to get even with rival Prithviraj Chouhan.Tej Pratap made it clear that he will contest the upcoming assembly polls from Mahua, a constituency that is adjacent to Tejashwi's Raghopur seat and from where he had made his debut in the 2015 assembly polls.Replying to a query on the centenary celebrations of the RSS , he said, ""The RSS had played no role in the Independence movement. We are followers of Mahatma Gandhi .""He also frowned upon the ""I love Muhammad"" controversy, saying, ""I have a copy of the Holy Quran. I hold the Prophet in high esteem.
