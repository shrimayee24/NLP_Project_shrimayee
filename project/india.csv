It's BJP vs BJP in poll for Constitution Club secy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/its-bjp-vs-bjp-in-poll-for-constitution-club-secy/articleshow/123268389.cms,"Constitution Club election saw true spirit of democracy: Rudy



NEW DELHI: In a tense contest between two BJP colleagues, former Union minister and Saran MP Rajiv Pratap Rudy seemed to have gained an unassailable lead over another ex-Union minister Sanjeev Balyan in the polls for the post of secretary (administration) at Constitution Club of India. Rudy was steadily widening his margin when reports last came in late on Tuesday.What was once a low-profile election acquired exciting dimensions this year, drawing prominent netas from various parties to cast their votes, thanks to Baliyan being in the fray with open support of another prominent BJP face, Nishikant Dubey.The Saran MP, of course, held on to his core support base among BJP colleagues.Union ministers Amit Shah, J P Nadda, Piyush Goyal and Kiren Rijiju from BJP, along with Congress's Sonia Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge, voted in the keenly contested election.Himachal Pradesh governor Shiv Pratap Shukla also turned up to cast his vote as the candidates lobbied intensively to rally supporters.Balyan's campaign had appeared to be growing in strength but a vigorous pitch for him by Dubey, a vocal critic of the Congress leadership led many from the opposition benches to develop an interest in the outcome of what had started as a BJP versus BJP affair. Rudy may have benefited from the twist, noted a keen watcher.Of the 1,295 current and former MPs eligible to vote, 679 cast their ballots in person, with an additional 38 postal ballots, totalling 707 votes - over 60% turnout.With a decisive lead, Rudy reacted by saying, ""When Congress leader Sonia ji arrived along with Kharge saheb, and from our party Amit Shah ji and Nadda saheb came, the true spirit of democracy was seen in the Constitution Club elections."" ""For the first time, people learned about an institution called the Constitution Club, a body of MPs and former MPs with history and dignity,"" Balyan said. ""The country now knows of its existence, and I hope MPs will engage more actively,"" he said. Rudy, blends urbanity with political savvy, having defeated opponents like Rabri Devi and Rohini Acharya in Saran in Lok Sabha elections. Balyan, from Uttar Pradesh, embodies rural grit and warmth, with strong ties within and beyond BJP.Congress's AP Jithender Reddy and Rajiv Shukla and DMK's Tiruchi Siva had been elected unopposed as treasurer, secretary (sports) and secretary (culture), respectively.","Rajiv Pratap Rudy seemed to have gained an unassailable lead over another ex- Union minister Sanjeev Balyan.

NEW DELHI: This is not ""vote chori"" but ""attention chori"", said Union minister and Karnataka BJP senior Pralhad Joshi on Tuesday as he highlighted how state minister KN Rajanna was sacked from the state cabinet after Congress sought action against him for criticising Rahul Gandhi for his allegations.Congress's ""vote chori"" narrative was a ploy to ensure that it got some attention, Joshi said, adding that the party had indulged in another forgery and fraud as its claim about Shakun Rani's double voting - in Mahadevapura assembly constituency - was false and the Karnataka CEO had also debunked it. ""A criminal case should be filed against them for spreading fake documents,"" he said.The CEO on Sunday issued a notice to Rahul, asking him to share documents based on which he alleged that Rani had voted twice.On Rajanna's resignation, Joshi said, ""He is considered very close to Siddarmaiah. As far as I know, CM instructed him that you would have to resign. But Rahul gave a message that he has to be sacked. The message was not to accept his resignation... If someone tells the truth, that person is removed immediately. He is a 72-year-old ST leader... It is their greatest insult to democratic institutions and also to the community which he represents.Joshi said Rajanna was removed as he pointed out that EC at the district and assembly segment level means deputy commissioner/district magistrate and sub-divisional magistrate. So, if any mistake occurred, it did so during Congress's tenure.Karnataka BJP president BY Vijayendra said Rahul does not have the patience to hear the facts. ""When Rajanna has spoken the truth, when he has set the records straight, why is Rahul upset?"" he said.","Congress's ""vote chori"" narrative was a ploy to ensure that it got some attention, says Pralhad Joshi.

Notice to political parties

BENGALURU: BJP MP from Karnataka, Lahar Singh Siroya, has written to the chief election commissioner urging him to investigate allegations made by former Congress functionary CM Ibrahim that the party bought votes during the 2018 assembly elections.Ibrahim, once a close associate of Siddaramaiah, claimed that he helped the CM buy 3,000 votes in Badami constituency in 2018, enabling him to win by a small margin.Siroya, in his letter Tuesday, said BJP’s B Sreeramulu, who lost to Siddaramaiah in that poll, might have information on how votes were purchased. “If he speaks, we’ll know more on what happened in 2018 when he contested from two seats and would have practically won both if this vote purchase had not happened,” Siroya said.Governing Congress, meanwhile, defended Rahul Gandhi’s claims of vote theft and argued that the Election Commission of India (ECI) cannot threaten the opposition leader in the Lok Sabha for speaking up on free and fair polls. It urged ECI to withdraw its notice to Rahul demanding proof and an oath.Ramesh Babu, chairman, media and communications department, KPCC, said it was ECI’s duty to ensure free and fair elections and safeguard those who raise concerns in good faith.“Any act of intimidation, reprisal or threat against such citizens would constitute a violation of basic democratic rights,” Babu said. “ECI should issue a clarification saying raising doubts on the poll process, when done in good faith, is a legitimate act and not punishable. ”Chief electoral officer V Anbukumar issued show-cause notices to 10 registered unrecognised political parties that have not contested polls since 2019 but continue to enjoy benefits such as income tax exemption.
