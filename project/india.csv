The court also imposed a fine of Rs 10 lakh on the 34-year-old, as reported by news agency PTI.Revanna, the grandson of former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda , broke down in court during the sentencing hearing, claiming he had done “nothing wrong” and pleading for leniency. “The only mistake I made in my life is growing fast in politics,” he told the court, as reported by PTI.Also read: Prajwal Revanna gets life imprisonment for raping 47-year-old domestic worker The suspended JD(S) MP further said, “I have a family, I have not seen my mother and father for six months now… please give me a less sentence is what I request the court.”The case pertains to a domestic help who was allegedly raped by Revanna twice—in 2021 at the family’s Gannikada farmhouse in Holenarasipura and later at a residence in Bengaluru. The accused had allegedly recorded the act on his mobile phone.Ahead of sentencing, Revanna, claimed the charges against him were politically motivated. “They say that I have raped multiple women, but none of the women have come out voluntarily to complain, they came six days prior to election (Lok Sabha polls last year)...the prosecution side brought them purposefully and made them give a complaint,” he told the court, as quoted by PTI.Also read: Prajwal Revanna conviction, a sex scandal that shook Karnataka Revanna also questioned the timing of the complaint, pointing out that the victim had not reported the alleged crime to her husband or relatives until explicit videos began circulating. “She comes and gives complaint when certain videos were circulated,” he said.The Special Investigation Team (SIT), which had been tasked with probing the multiple cases against Revanna, filed a 1,632-page chargesheet in September 2024, featuring 113 witnesses. He was booked under several IPC sections including 376(2)(k), 376(2)(n), 354A, 354B, 354C, 506, and 201, as well as Section 66E of the IT Act.According to Special Public Prosecutor Ashok Nayak, the prosecution relied on digital evidence, including videos recorded by the accused, DNA reports, and material recovered years after the alleged incidents. “The clothes worn by the victim during the rape were also identified and seized after three-four years,” he said, crediting the Investigation Officer for preserving critical forensic evidence.Revanna was arrested on May 31 last year after landing in Bengaluru from Germany. The allegations first came to light in April 2024, just ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, when pen drives containing explicit videos allegedly featuring him were circulated in Hassan. He later failed to retain his Hassan constituency seat in the polls. Following the emergence of these cases, the JD(S) suspended him from the party.",Prajwal Revanna was sentenced to life imprisonment by a special court in Bengaluru.

Malegaon case

What happened in 2008

NEW DELHI: Sadhvi Pragya, recently acquitted of terror charges in the Malegaon blast case , claimed on Saturday that she was ""tortured and forced to name Prime Minister Narendra Modi, UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, and others"".The former Bhopal MP said she did not name them, as it was ""a clear attempt to coerce her into lying"".“They made me name several people, including Ram Madhav. To do all of this, they tortured me. My lungs gave up... I was detained in a hospital illegally. All of this will shared in the story I am writing, but the truth cannot be buried. I lived in Gujarat, so they also asked me name Prime Minister Modi (who was then Gujarat chief minister). I did not take anyone's name because they were trying to make me lie,"" she said.She further claimed that the other names she was pressured to mention included Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, Mohan Bhagwat, and senior Sangh functionary Indresh Kumar.""They said take these names and we won't beat you,"" she alleged.After nearly 17 years, a special NIA court in Mumbai on July 31 acquitted all seven accused in the 2008 Malegaon blast case, including former BJP MP Pragya Singh Thakur and Lt Col Prasad Purohit.All were already out on bail.The blast, which struck Malegaon town in Nashik district on September 29, 2008, killed six people and injured over 100. The court ordered compensation of Rs 2 lakh to the families of the deceased and Rs 50,000 to each injured victim.In its verdict, the court noted that the chassis number of the motorcycle allegedly used in the blast had been wiped out. It also ruled that there was no reliable evidence proving that Thakur owned the vehicle. The court further observed that she had taken sanyas (renunciation) two years prior to the incident and had given up material possessions.An explosive device, allegedly strapped to a motorcycle, detonated near a mosque during the holy month of Ramzan and on the eve of Navratri festivities. Among the other accused acquitted are Major Ramesh Upadhyay (Retd), Ajay Rahirkar, Sameer Kulkarni, Sudhakar Chaturvedi, and Sudhakar Dhar Dwivedi.The ATS had alleged that the motorcycle used in the blast belonged to Thakur, while Purohit brought the RDX from Jammu and Kashmir and stored it in his house. Both denied the allegations. They were acquitted from charges under various stringent sections of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) and the Indian Penal Code (IPC), including committing a terrorist act, conspiring to commit a terrorist act, criminal conspiracy, murder, and promoting enmity between religious groups.The investigation, initially led by the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) under the late Hemant Karkare, quickly led to the arrest of Thakur and now Purohit in late 2008. The ATS, at the time, alleged, for the first time, the involvement of ""saffron extremists"" and linked the accused to a larger conspiracy, including other blast cases.Investigations into the alleged larger conspiracy of the Abhinav Bharat organization allegedly brought to light a series of crucial meetings, painting a picture of a group purportedly intent on avenging perceived atrocities against Hindus and establishing a ""Central Hindu Government"" (Aryawart). The prosecution contended that these gatherings demonstrate a calculated effort to strike terror by orchestrating a bomb blast in Malegaon, a Muslim-dominated area.The case took a significant turn when it was transferred to the NIA in 2011. In 2015, special public prosecutor Rohini Salian publicly alleged that the NIA had instructed her to ""go soft"" on the accused, leading to a change in prosecution. The NIA's supplementary chargesheet in May 2016, accusing the ATS of planting RDX traces to frame Purohit and, notably, giving a clean chit to Thakur and others, citing insufficient evidence.Despite the NIA's stance, the special court on December 27, 2017, ruled that seven accused, including Thakur and Purohit, would face trial under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), though charges under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) were dropped. Finally, on October 30, 2018, terror and murder charges were formally framed against Thakur, Purohit, and five others. The trial, commenced on Dec 3, 2018.The proceedings were also characterized by over 323 prosecution witnesses, with 37 turning hostile, and a rejected plea for an in-camera trial. The trial also saw numerous dramatic moments. In June 2019, Pragya Singh Thakur, by then an elected Member of Parliament from Bhopal, famously caused a stir in court, complaining about the ""dirty and small"" chair and the ""dusty"" courtroom.The recording of final statements from the accused concluded in 2024, followed by the examination of eight defence witnesses. The long journey to judgment also saw five different judges preside over the case, with the tenure of the current special judge, A K Lahoti, recently extended by the Bombay high court till August 31, 2025, to ensure he could deliver the verdict.Final arguments concluded in April 2025, and after a brief adjournment from May 8, the matter was finally reserved for the verdict.","'I Was Forced To Name PM Modi': Sadhvi Pragya's EXPLOSIVE Claim In Malegaon Blast Case.

Rahul Gandhi's EXPLOSIVE ‘Rigging’ Allegation Against ECI Ahead Of Bihar Assembly Polls

NEW DELHI: Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday criticised Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for his comments on late union minister and senior BJP leader Arun Jaitley , calling them “irresponsible” and stating such remarks ultimately damage the Congress.Sitharaman responded to Gandhi's comments made earlier in the day where he had claimed that former finance minister Jaitley “threatened” him on behalf of the government when he was fighting against the farm laws.In a post on X, Sitharaman said, ""If irresponsibility has a face, it is Rahul Gandhi, Leader of Opposition in LS. To throw baseless allegations at people in public life, even those who are no longer with us, is becoming a personality trait for him. His remarks on the late Shri. Arun Jaitley is despicable. India needs a strong opposition party. An irresponsible leadership hurts his party @INCIndia and the country. But does he care?""Speaking at the Congress-organised Annual Legal Conclave 2025, the leader of opposition alleged in his address that the NDA government had deployed the late minister to ""threaten"" him for opposing the farm laws introduced by the Modi government in 2020.""I remember when I was fighting the farm laws, Arun Jaitley was sent to me to threaten me. He told me, 'If you carry on opposing the government, fighting the farm laws, we will have to act against you. ' I looked at him and said 'I don't think you have an idea who you are talking to,'"" Rahul Gandhi said.Earlier Gandhi’s claim drew a sharp rebuke from Jatley’s son Rohan Jaitely, who accused the Congress MP of misrepresenting the facts and politicising the memory of the late leader.He called his claims factually incorrect and in bad taste.“Rahul Gandhi now claims my late father, Arun Jaitley, threatened him over the farm laws. Let me remind him, my father passed away in 2019. The farm laws were introduced in 2020,” Rohan Jaitley said in a post on X.The Congress leader also criticised the election commission of India, accusing it of being complicit in widespread voter fraud.","Sitharaman responded to Gandhi's comments made earlier in the day where he had claimed that former finance minister Jaitley “threatened” him when he was fighting against the farm laws.

'Mai Raja Nahi Hoon': Rahul Gandhi Responds To Congress Workers' Slogans At Legal Conclave

Nahi... Nahi... Main raja nahi hoon. Raja banna bhi nahi chahta hoon. Main raja ke concept ke against hoon

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi was greeted with an unexpected chant at the party’s high-profile Legal Conclave in New Delhi on Saturday: “.” But the Leader of opposition in Lok Sabha was quick to shut it down.As Rahul took the stage to speak at the event titled “Constitutional Challenges: Perspectives and Pathways”, party workers broke into chants of “” (“What kind of king should the country have? One like Rahul Gandhi!”).In response, Rahul said, “.” (“No, no… I am not a king. I do not want to become a king. I am against the concept of kingship.”)The Congress leader used the platform to launch a scathing attack on the Election Commission of India (ECI), alleging that the 2024 Lok Sabha elections were “rigged” and that India’s electoral system is “already dead”.""The truth is that the election system in India is already dead. The Prime Minister of India holds office with a very slim majority. If 15 seats were rigged—and we suspect that the number is over 70 to 80—he would not have been the Prime Minister of India,"" Rahul claimed.He also alleged that the Congress had undertaken a six-month investigation which revealed large-scale electoral fraud. Citing one Assembly seat in Karnataka, the congress leader claimed that out of 6.5 lakh voters, 1.5 lakh were “fake”. “You will see the shockwave that is going to go through the electoral system when we release this data. It is literally like an atom bomb,” he said.Rahul further alleged that the ECI has been ""obliterated and taken over"". “We have such proof that will show the whole country that the institution of the Election Commission does not exist. It has disappeared,” he said.Reiterating that he had suspected electoral wrongdoing since 2014, the LoP recalled the BJP’s sweeping wins in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan, where Congress failed to win even a single seat. He cited the case of Maharashtra, where he said one crore new voters appeared in the run-up to the Assembly elections—most of whom backed the BJP.He concluded by asserting, “I say with absolutely no doubt that we have proof. And whoever I have shown it to has fallen off the chair. They literally said how can it be possible. But it is possible. It’s happening. Literally.”The conclave was hosted by the AICC’s Department of Law, Human Rights and RTI.","Rahul Gandhi was greeted with an unexpected chant at the party’s high-profile Legal Conclave in New Delhi on Saturday.

EW DELHI: Maharashtra deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde on Saturday strongly defended former BJP MP Pragya Thakur after her controversial claim that she was tortured during the Malegaon blast probe, and accused the Congress-led UPA government of using the incident to frame prominent Hindutva leaders.S peaking in Thane, Shinde said: “Even in the blasts that happened before the Malegaon bomb blast, it was said that this is ‘saffron terrorism’. The then Congress and the UPA government gave it this form. This is an insult to Hindus... A retired police officer had said that RSS leader Mohan Bhagwat should also be implicated in this case... An attempt was made to implicate the prominent leaders of Hindutva in this case.”Shinde also backed Thakur’s recent allegations that investigators pressured her to take Prime Minister Narendra Modi's name. “Sadhvi Pragya said that she was tortured to take PM Modi's name in this case... How can anyone do such a disgusting act for votes and politics?” he asked, before launching a sharp attack on Rahul Gandhi “Rahul Gandhi always speaks the language of Pakistan. He is famous in Pakistan... Is this patriotism? This is love for Pakistan.The politicians who pressured those conducting the investigation should be investigated, their narco tests should be performed, and strict action should be taken against them,” Shinde said.Thakur, who was acquitted this week in the 2008 Malegaon blasts case along with six others, had earlier told reporters that officers tried to force her to name top BJP and RSS leaders including PM Modi and RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat. She alleged illegal detention and torture, although the court found no evidence to support these claims. “I did not take anyone’s name because I didn’t want to lie,” Thakur said, adding that she is writing her story to reveal the full truth.The special NIA court ruled that the prosecution had failed to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt.

He mentioned that Dhankhar had suspended a record number of MPs from Rajya Sabha, while Congress MP Rajni Patil was suspended for seven months, lamenting ""this is their democracy"".But then, he said, Dhankhar one day woke up to his constitutional role because he realised that his tenure would be remembered in history if he worked as per rules, rubbing the PM and BJP the wrong way.The Congress brass, including Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, attended the conclave themed ""Constitutional Challenges: Perspectives & Pathways"".
