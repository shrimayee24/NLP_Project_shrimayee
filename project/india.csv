ECI reviews new initiatives

Political parties seek phased elections post-Chhath



NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India (ECI) is set to announce the schedule for the Bihar assembly elections and bypolls in select states at 4 pm today. The announcement comes after the poll body conducted a two-day review of preparedness in Bihar, meeting political parties and enforcement agencies to ensure free, fair, and smooth elections.The electoral battle is expected to be largely a direct contest between the ruling National Democratic Alliance ( NDA ), led by chief minister Nitish Kumar, and the Mahagathbandhan, spearheaded by the Tejashwi Yadav of Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) Tejash. The 243-member Bihar Assembly currently has 131 NDA seats and 111 Mahagathbandhan seats.On Sunday, Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Gyanesh Kumar announced that 17 new initiatives have been implemented for the Bihar polls. Speaking at a press conference in Patna, he said, “Seventeen new initiatives have been successfully implemented in Bihar; some will be implemented in the conduct of elections, and some in counting.”Highlighting improvements in voter list management, the CEC said, “Electoral Registration Officers (EROs) are responsible for preparing the voter list. In Bihar, there is an ERO in each of the 243 assembly constituencies.Together, they, along with 243 EROs and 90,207 BLOs, completed the task of cleansing the voter list after nearly 22 years.”Other measures include doubling remuneration for BLOs, BLO supervisors, polling and counting staff, CAPF, monitoring teams, and micro-observers. Provision of honorarium has also been extended to EROs and AEROs for the first time, along with enhanced refreshments. Mobile phone deposit counters outside polling stations and colour photographs of candidates on EVMs are among other reforms. The CEC added, “Hundred percent webcasting will be carried out in every booth during the Bihar polls. ”During its visit, the ECI met with representatives of national and state parties, including AAP, BSP, BJP , CPI(M), Congress, NPP, CPI(ML), JD(U), LJP, RJD, and RLJP, seeking suggestions to ensure maximum voter participation. Party representatives urged holding elections after Chhath, Bihar’s most important festival, and in minimal phases.JD(U) Bihar president Umesh Singh Kushwaha said, “We have urged the ECI to conduct elections in a single phase and just right after Chhath Puja so that people living outside the state can also cast their vote.” BJP Bihar chief Dilip Jaiswal said, “We have also called for marches of paramilitary forces in backward areas to make sure people are at ease.”The final electoral roll, published on September 30, lists 7.42 crore electors compared to 7.89 crore as of June 24. The NDA currently holds 131 seats (BJP 80, JD(U) 45, HAM(S) 4, 2 Independents), while the Mahagathbandhan holds 111 seats (RJD 77, Congress 19, CPI(ML) 11, CPI(M) 2, CPI 2).Political activity has intensified across Bihar, with parties trading charges and ramping up campaigns ahead of the high-stakes elections.","The Election Commission of India (ECI) is set to announce the schedule for the Bihar assembly elections and bypolls in select states at 4 pm today.

"Lingayat is a separate religion, says CM Siddaramaiah; hits out at caste system",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lingayat-is-a-separate-religion-says-karnataka-cm-siddaramaiah/articleshow/124325817.cms,"File photo: Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah

BENGALURU: Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah said on Sunday that Lingayat is a separate religion, a statement that is likely to reignite the opposition’s allegations made during 2013-18 that he was trying to divide Veerashaiva-Lingayat community.Speaking at the closing ceremony of Basava cultural campaign 2025, which was organised by Lingayat Seers’ Association, the CM said, “Caste system is rooted in our society. To uproot this caste system, Basavanna launched a separate religion.”The statement comes amid the confusion within Lingayat community, which has been divided over whether to register themselves in the ongoing socio-educational survey as a separate religion or as a caste under Hindu religion.While opposition BJP has been urging Veerashaiva-Lingayats to identify themselves as a caste and strengthen Hindu community in the state, the Congress leadership has been seeking to project the community as a separate religion.In fact, at the beginning of his speech, he said he did not want to dwell upon a lot of matters at the Lingayat convention as whatever he says will soon turn into a controversy. Attacking the caste system in his speech, Siddaramaiah said, “I’m a Shudra under the Chaturvarna system.Just because I’m Shudra (doesn’t mean) I can be denied opportunity for education and equality. Caste does not make anyone big or famous ... Knowledge is nobody’s property and cannot be denied. ”Siddaramaiah urged the lower castes and all those who follow the principles of Basavanna to consolidate towards ensuring a casteless society in the country.“(Ram Manohar) Lohia once said rallies by forward castes is a caste consolidation effort. But rallies by backward castes and the downtrodden is not consolidation, but a rally towards seeking equality. If we want an equal and humane society then we must consolidate to achieve this goal,” he said.",Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah said on Sunday that Lingayat is a separate religion. The statement is likely to reignite the opposition’s allegations made during 2013-18 that he was trying to divide Veerashaiva-Lingayats.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124325841,imgsize-835174,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-47.jpg"

‘Truth Will Come Out’: Vijay Releases First Video Message After Karur Stampede Tragedy

KARUR: Tamil Nadu police charged the driver of actor-politician Vijay's bus with negligent driving, a day after Madras high court questioned why no FIR was filed over two alleged hit-and-run accidents involving the convoy of the TVK chief's campaign during the September 27 Karur stampede that killed 41 people.Inspector RS Om Prakash said a case was registered against the campaign bus driver under Section 281 of BNS, which deals with rash driving or riding on a public way that endangers life. Asked why no separate case was filed under provisions specific to hit-and-run, he said Section 281 ""also covers that aspect"", but declined to elaborate.HC had earlier said: ""Media footage shows the bus carrying Vijay was involved in an accident where two motorcycles were hit. The driver, after seeing the accident, fled the scene. A similar collision at the rear of the bus is also visible. In both cases, FIRs have not been registered.""A police SIT formed to probe the stampede began its work Sunday. Headed by IG Asra Garg, the team inspected the Velusamypuram rally site. ""Probe has just begun. Nothing more can be said at this stage,"" Garg said.The team will probe alleged overcrowding, security lapses, crowd control failures, and claims that Vijay's delayed arrival triggered the fatal crowd crush. The stampede has since sparked a fierce political row - Vijay's TVK hinting at a conspiracy, while the AIADMK and BJP blamed the DMK-led state government. CM MK Stalin's govt has claimed that the crowd surge followed Vijay's delayed appearance.",Madras high court questioned why no FIR was filed over two alleged hit-and-run accidents involving the convoy of the TVK chief's campaign.
