IPS Officer 'Suicide': Wife Seeks FIR Against Haryana DGP, Rohtak SP Over 'Harassment And Abetment'

Body taken to mortuary but autopsy put off

Pressure on Haryana governement to take action against DGP

CHANDIGARH: In the strongest commitment yet of action in the alleged suicide of senior IPS officer Y Puran Kumar, Haryana chief minister Nayab Singh Saini warned on Saturday that no one will be spared, “no matter how influential”.The CM’s statement came hours after Rohtak SP Narendra Bijarniya was removed from his post. Bijarniya has not been given any posting and will be attached to police HQ in Panchkula. Bijarniya and Haryana DGP Shatrujeet Kapur were named in Puran Kumar’s suicide note and his wife IAS officer Amneet P Kumar’s complaint to policeas the alleged “harassers” who drove him to suicide.Amneet has refused to allow an autopsy of her husband’s body until action is taken against the DGP & SP. It has been nearly five days since Puran Kumar’s suicide. On Saturday evening, while addressing the BJP state executive in Panchkula, Saini began by offering condolences to the deceased IPS officer. He expressed solidarity with the IPS officer’s family and said: “Our governement will conduct a thorough investigation into this matter.” He urged the opposition not to play politics.Chandigarh police faced backlash from the family of the IPS officer when it tried to get an autopsy done on Saturday, leading DGP Sagarpreet Hooda to say that the postmortem would not be conducted until the family agreed, reports Pawan Tiwari.Wife Amneet’s brother Amit Rattan, an AAP MLA, alleged police shifted the body without notifying the kin. The body was moved to PGI mortuary, where a team was ready for an autopsy. However, the family’s objection forced police put it on hold. DGP Hooda, IG Pushpendra Kumar & SSP Kanwardeep Kaur went to Amneet to get her nod, but she refused.Amneet P Kumar was a member of Haryana CM Nayab Singh Saini’s delegation on an official tour of Japan when her husband, Y Puran Kumar, allegedly shot himself dead. She flew home immediately. On returning from Japan, CM Saini had called on Amneet at her Chandigarh residence.During the meeting, Amneet had handed him a two-page letter seeking justice and protection for her family and action against those named in the suicide note, especially DGP Shatrujeet Kapur and then Rohtak SP Narendra Bijarniya, for abetting her husband’s “suicide”. Two days later, on Saturday, Haryana governement removed Bijarniya and replaced him with IPS officer Surinder Singh Bhoria. This was the first action initiated by governement. Pressure is mounting on the governement to take action against Kapur as well. There is intense speculation that he may be asked to go on leave, but till Saturday evening there was no word from governement.The question in bureaucratic circles is whether governement will take action against the DGP. A section of Haryana IAS officers has also demanded Kapur’s arrest. Amneet said a “false FIR” registered in Rohtak was the “trigger point” for her husband’s “suicide”. Bijarniya was the supervising officer of the case in which head constable Sushil Kumar, PSO to Puran Kumar when he was IG Rohtak, was arrested on allegations of extortion. Police claimed Sushil had “confessed” during questioning that he had demanded money on behalf of Puran Kumar.A day after the IPS officer died, Bijarniya said, “The complainant provided audio-visual evidence which led to Sushil’s arrest. He was taken into custody for two days and confessed to demanding on behalf of Kumar. We were in the process of further investigation when we came to know about this incident (Kumar’s alleged suicide).” Kumar was shifted out as IGP (Rohtak range) on September 29. Sushil was arrested soon after. A day after the FIR was lodged, Kumar allegedly died by suicide. State chief secretary Anurag Rastogi and ACS-home Sumita Misra spent almost the entire Friday trying to pacify Amneet, but she stuck to her stand.",Haryana chief minister Nayab Singh Saini warns that no one will be spared. Rohtak SP Narendra Bijarniya has been removed from his post.

KOLKATA: A 48-year-old YouTuber from Bengal with almost 4.3 million followers and his teenage son were arrested in North 24 Parganas district’s Haroa on Sunday for allegedly raping a 15-year- old girl after luring her with the promise of featuring her in comedy and dance reels.The survivor’s father is a cop attached to Kolkata Police.

Congress questions 'respect' for allies



Weeks of negotiation



NEW DELHI: The ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in Bihar has finalised its seat-sharing for the upcoming assembly elections, after days of intense negotiations among allies.After earlier demanding 15 seats for his party, Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) chief and Union minister Jitan Ram Manjhi struck a somewhat contradictory tone following the seat-sharing announcement. While he expressed satisfaction with the six seats allotted to HAM(S), he also suggested that the NDA had undervalued his party and warned that such decisions could have repercussions within the alliance.""What the high command decided, we accept, but by giving six seats, they have undervalued us, it may have repercussions in NDA,"" he said.""In Parliament, we were given one seat, still we were happy. Here, we have been given six seats, and we respect the decision of the leadership.""""We are satisfied with what we have been allotted and we have no complaints,"" he added.Prior to the announcement, all eyes were on Chirag Paswan's LJP (RV), Union minister Jitan Ram Manjhi led HAM(S). While Chirag made a strong pitch for a larger share by leveraging his party’s 100% strike rate in Bihar during the recent Lok Sabha elections, Manjhi sought dignity and recognition, reportedly demanding at least 15 seats to maintain HAM(S)’s previous strike rate from the 2020 Assembly polls.The final seat allocation was announced by Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan was: BJP and Janata Dal (United) will contest on 101 seats each, while Chirag Paswan-led Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) will field candidates on 29 seats. Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) and Upendra Kushwaha’s Rashtriya Lok Morcha (RLM) will contest six seats each.Congress latched onto the seat-sharing announcement criticising NDA's 'treatment' of smaller allies.“What has Manjhi ji been saying over the past 15 days? His community was allocated 6 seats in the NDA. Upendra Kushwaha got 6 seats, indicating NDA assigned this many to the Kushwaha community. Does this mean the Kushwaha community is worth only 6 seats in Bihar?” Congress leader Manoj Kumar asked.Kumar further questioned if Chirag Paswan, who reportedly sought 40 seats, was truly respected with 29. Accusing the NDA of undermining key caste groups, he claimed the alliance had been “preparing to deal with” its allies rather than honouring them.""This was done because preparations were underway in the NDA to deal with these people... Jitan Ram Manjhi asked for respect, so did he receive it with 6 seats?"" he questioned.The seat-sharing announcement followed intense parleys in New Delhi over the weekend, involving top NDA figures including BJP president JP Nadda, Union ministers Amit Shah and Rajnath Singh, and Bihar leaders such as deputy CM Samrat Choudhary and state BJP chief Dilip Jaiswal.While BJP has sacrificed some seats (down from 110 in 2020), it seems to have emerged as the dominant partner in terms of influence, evident in how it brokered peace among allies and ensured cohesion ahead of the two-phase elections scheduled for November 6 and 11. Vote counting will take place on November 14.On the other side of the political aisle, the INDIA bloc led by the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) is yet to finalise its seat-sharing formula. RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav, his son Tejashwi Yadav, and wife Rabri Devi have travelled to Delhi amid reports of tension with the Congress, which is pushing to contest close to 70 seats—similar to its 2020 tally, when it won 19.","The ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in Bihar has finalised its seat- sharing for the upcoming assembly elections.

SRINAGAR: Jammu and Kashmir Congress president Tariq Hamid Karra on Sunday said his party would not contest the October 24 Rajya Sabha elections to four seats in the Union territory, accusing alliance partner National Conference (NC) of refusing it a “safe seat”.Addressing reporters after a party meeting here, Karra said it was unanimously agreed that Congress would not contest the Rajya Sabha polls.The Congress central leadership had sought one of the two Rajya Sabha seats that are going to polls separately but the NC offered the party one of the two seats, which are going to polls under a common notification, Karra said.“Keeping this in mind, all the participants (at the meeting) were of the opinion that seat four is not safe like seat one or two. It was unanimously decided that we will not put up our candidate for seat number four. We will leave it to our alliance partners to see what they think about that,"" Karra said.NC has already named its three candidates for the Rajya Sabha polls.Given the numbers in the Assembly, all three NC candidates appear assured of victory while the fourth candidate of the ruling alliance will need every anti-BJP vote to win.The three MLAs of the PDP , one each from People's Conference, Awami Ittehad Party and AAP will have to vote for the ruling party candidate to ensure victory on the fourth seat.Karra said a marathon discussion took place about the working of the alliance, the Rajya Sabha polls and the by-elections to two Assembly seats — Budgam and Nagrota. Omar Abdullah vacated Budgam after retaining Ganderbal, and BJP legislator Davinder Singh Rana, who represented Nagrota, died in October 2024.The PCC chief said the party has also written to the chief minister Omar Abdullah explaining the party’s stance on the RS polls. “He advised us to forward the letter to Dr Farooq Abdullah, which we did, but there has been no response so far,” Karra said.A senior Congress leader said the ruling NC is trying to please the BJP by ensuring there is no Congress candidate in the Rajya Sabha polls.However, Nasir Aslam Wani, advisor to the CM, said NC has been in discussions with Congress for many days, claiming that the Congress was in a strong position to seat four. “NC has been fighting BJP all along. If the Congress decides not to contest, we will have to field our own fourth candidate against BJP. It is we who are taking on the BJP.”All four Rajya Sabha seats from J&K have remained vacant since February 2021.The 90-member J&K Assembly currently has 88 sitting members.",Jammu and Kashmir Congress president Tariq Hamid Karra said his party would not contest the October 24 Rajya Sabha elections to four seats in the Union territory.
