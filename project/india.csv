CHENNAI: Asserting that Tamil Nadu was safe for women and children, chief minister M K Stalin on Wednesday assured ""swift investigation and filing of chargesheet within 60 days"" in the Anna University rape case . In a bid to counter the AIADMK offensive on the issue, he raked up the Pollachi sexual assault case .""Govt will make every effort to try the case quickly through a special court and ensure that the perpetrator gets maximum punishment,"" he said in the assembly.Stalin's criticism of previous AIADMK govt's handling of the Pollachi sexual assault case during its tenure sparked commotion, with party members staging a walkout.Responding to a special calling attention motion regarding the Anna University rape case, the CM described it as ""a horrific act"". ""If the investigation reveals that more culprits were involved, whoever they are, strict action will be taken without any mercy,"" he said, commending police for quick action in arresting Gnanasekaran. With the opposition intensifying the 'who is that sir?' campaign, Stalin said parties could provide any evidence to the special investigation team of the high court.On allegations of Gnanasekaran being a member of the governing DMK, Stalin said he was only a party sympathiser. ""We do not deny that. He might have taken photographs with ministers and politicians... whoever it may be, even if they are DMK persons, we will take action. There is no change in that stand. He is a sympathiser and that is the truth. We did not protect him. He was arrested immediately.""Stalin accused the opposition of indulging in ""cheap activities"" for publicity and political gains in a sensitive case involving a student, and said his govt would deal with crimes against women with an iron fist. ""Many are trying to create a conspiracy theory by using this incident to say women are completely unsafe,"" the CM said. He added surveillance cameras helped identify and arrest the accused and refuted claims of inadequate security. On the leak of the FIR, he blamed the National Informatics Centre of Union govt, while adding that state police addressed the technical glitch promptly.The CM accused AIADMK of inaction despite evidence in the Pollachi case, in which a gang sexually assaulted women over two years. The truth emerged only after CBI took over the case, he said. ""The probe clearly said the incident was committed by AIADMK members. To protect them, AIADMK enacted a big drama as if such an incident never happened.""",Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin says Anna University rape case will be tried in a special court.

One person entered politics, and the public, swayed by his smooth talk, crowned him with power. But as soon as he came to power, he shattered the public's trust. Everyone who considered him a common man was ashamed. While talking about the common man, he made himself special and gathered all the luxuries for himself. The truth of this hypocrisy hidden under the guise of a common man has been exposed,"" BJP said.""The public has uncovered the massive loot under the name of a palace. Yes, you guessed it right. We are talking about Arvind Kejriwal, who changed colors faster than a chameleon once he gained power. Kejriwal, who once spoke against taking a bungalow, built a 52-crore palace with the public's hard-earned money. And not only did he build the palace, but he also furnished it with luxuries that even a seven-star hotel doesn't offer,"" it added.BJP alleged that the CM residence includes 5-crore remote-controlled curtains, a 1-crore railing, 70-lakh automatic doors, 65-lakh TVs, 30-lakh remote-controlled lights, a 9-lakh fridge, and a 4-lakh massage chair.""However, the so-called honest and simple Kejriwal's palace includes 5-crore remote-controlled curtains, a 1-crore railing, 70-lakh automatic doors, 65-lakh TVs, 30-lakh remote-controlled lights, a 9-lakh fridge, and a 4-lakh massage chair. The list is very long. Moreover, Kejriwal is so 'common' that the cost of one of his toilet seats is 12 lakh,"" BJP alleged.""He was so fond of this 'ordinary' toilet seat that he took it with him when he vacated the palace. After all, indulgence is a big thing, even if it means emptying Delhi's treasury to fulfill Kejriwal's 'common' desires or drowning Delhi in debt for the first time in 30 years. But the grandeur of Kejriwal, who surpassed great emperors in his royal lifestyle, should not diminish at all,"" it added.Meanwhile, challenging the BJP over its allegations on the ""Sheesh Mahal"" issue, AAP leader Sanjay Singh alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi lived in a ""Rajmahal"" worth Rs 2,700 crores and challenged the BJP to open it up for a similar visit with the media.The Rajya Sabha MP alleged that all of BJP, from the prime minister to his party members, is running a propaganda campaign over the ""Sheesh Mahal"".The CM’s official residence, which underwent renovations in 2020-21, has been at the centre of a controversy following BJP’s allegations of “excessive expenditure” and violation of norms.AAP has consistently maintained that the house was not intended solely for Kejriwal, but for every subsequent CM. Later, when Kejriwal resigned from the post, his successor Atishi moved to the residence but had to vacate after PWD said it was yet to take stock of inventories before making a fresh allotment.","BJP accuses Kejriwal of steering away from his old promise of living in a two- room house and building a ""den of loot"" as he came to power.

I am personally grateful to Mamata didi. Thank you didi. You have always supported and blessed us in our good and bad times.""
