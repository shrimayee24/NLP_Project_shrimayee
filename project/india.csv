Supreme Court upholds BJP govt’s decision to cancel constable recruitment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-upholds-bjp-govts-decision-to-cancel-constable-recruitment/articleshow/118914697.cms,"Representative Image

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has said the north-eastern states, which is a confluence of people belonging to a mosaic of tribes, castes and ethnicity, must foster diversity and inclusivity in public services by ensuring representation to candidates from hills and historically backward classes.The court, which is still dealing with cases relating to Kuki-Meitei ethnic clashes in Manipur which had erupted in May 2023 over apprehensions of grant of scheduled tribe status to Meiteis, last week upheld BJP government’s 2016 decision to cancel Tarun Gogoi-led Congress government’s poll-eve interview-based recruitment of constables for Assam Forest Protection Force as no one from 16 districts of the state got selected.Setting aside concurrent judgments of single judge and division bench of the Gauhati HC directing the state to give appointment to the 104 selected candidates, a bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and Manmohan said two reasons – the selections being only based on interview which is prone to manipulation and non-selection of any candidate belonging to 16 districts – weigh in favour of cancellation of the examination.Writing the judgment, Justice Datta said, “Fostering diversity and inclusivity in public service, ensuring that there is representation from almost all the districts including from the hills and historically backward classes without, however, compromising merit should be the commitment of all govts of the north-Eastern states of the country.”The bench expressed surprise that though the notification for recruitment was published in 2014, the selection process was carried out in 2016. Immediately after the change in government, the Principal Chief Conservator of Forest (PCCF) wrote to the government complaining that the process was not fair and smacked of nepotism.Finding that the selection process had “a coat of discernible taint suggesting impropriety and bias”, the bench said, “The decision taken by the successor Government of cancelling the process initiated by the earlier govt cannot be said to be disproportionate and incommensurate with the illegalities/irregularities detected.”“We, thus, unhesitatingly arrive at the conclusion that based on the note of the PCCF dated 4th July, 2016 and the recommendation made by him for cancellation of the select list, the decision of the Government to approve the said note and, thereby, cancel the select list did not stand vitiated to attract its invalidation either by application of the doctrine of Wednesbury unreasonableness or proportionality,” the bench said. While directing the state to fill the 104 posts of constables through a transparent process.",The Supreme Court has said the north-eastern states must foster diversity and inclusivity in public services. The court is still dealing with cases relating to Kuki-Meitei ethnic clashes in Manipur which erupted in May 2023 over apprehensions of grant of scheduled tribe status to Meiteis.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118914869,imgsize-21068,width-400,resizemode-4/118914869.jpg"
"'Eyesore, public nuisance': Delhi court orders FIR against Arvind Kejriwal over alleged misuse of funds",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-court-orders-fir-against-arvind-kejriwal-over-alleged-public-property-defacement/articleshow/118890069.cms,"Court cites public nuisance and safety concerns

Investigation ordered amid allegations of cover-up

Legal proceedings revived after initial dismissal

A Delhi court on Tuesday directed the police to file an FIR against former chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and others in a case of public property defacement . Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate Neha Mittal passed the order based on a complaint by Shiv Kumar Saxena, who provided visual evidence of banners featuring Kejriwal and other AAP leaders placed illegally across the city.The court noted that the large-sized banners installed by Kejriwal, former MLA Gulab Singh, and former Dwarka Councillor Nitika Sharma not only defaced public property but also posed traffic hazards. ""Deaths caused by the collapse of illegal hoardings are not new in India,"" the court observed, emphasizing the seriousness of the offence.It ruled that ""hanging a banner board or affixing hoardings"" amounted to defacement under Section 3 of the Delhi Prevention of Defacement of Property Act, 2007. The court instructed the concerned Station House Officer (SHO) to register an FIR immediately under this provision.The court criticized the police's previous handling of the complaint, noting that an action taken report (ATR) submitted by the SHO failed to confirm whether the hoardings existed on the alleged date. ""The ATR stating that no hoardings were found appears to be an attempt to hoodwink the court,"" the order said.The court directed the police to thoroughly investigate the origins of the banners, including details of their printing and installation. It dismissed arguments from the public prosecutor regarding the omission of certain names from the complaint, stating that the investigating agency has the authority to include individuals not originally named.Saxena had first filed his complaint in 2019, alleging that Kejriwal and his associates misused public funds to install large hoardings in Dwarka. A magisterial court initially dismissed the plea in 2022, but a sessions court later ordered a fresh review.""The matter is remanded back to the trial court to decide the application under Section 156(3) CrPC afresh,"" the sessions court had ruled in January.With the latest directive, the Delhi Police now faces a deadline to register the FIR and submit a compliance report, setting the stage for a renewed legal battle for Kejriwal and the AAP leadership.","A Delhi court has ordered the police to file an FIR against former chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and others in a case of public property defacement.

NEW DELHI: After Rahul Gandhi called out Congress insiders for supporting the BJP in Gujarat, former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Digvijaya Singh asked when Gandhi would take action against those inside enemies. ""When will Rahul Gandhi expel BJP supporters from Congress?"" posted the former CM of Madhya Pradesh on X.Rahul Gandhi, while addressing party workers in Ahmedabad on Saturday, suggested that some were ""cut off"" from the people and half of them were ""in cahoots"" with the BJP. ""The leadership of Gujarat, the workers of Gujarat, the district presidents (Congress) of Gujarat, the block presidents, there are two types of people in them, there are divisions.

He was told Hindus would get angry if he said anything against the RSS. ""The Sangh does not represent the Hindus. It only misleads and exploits the Hindus in the name of religion,"" Digvijaya said adding that the Hindus have Shankaracharyas as their leaders.

NEW DELHI: A heated exchange erupted in Rajya Sabha on Tuesday over Congress president and leader of opposition Mallikarjun Kharge ’s “aapko theek se thokenge” remark, with BJP strongly protesting against the “expression” and demanded its expungement as well as an apology from him.The confrontation was set off while the opposition was agitating for an apology from education minister Dharmendra Pradhan for his remark accusing DMK MPs of fudging facts over the language row and dubbing them “uncivilized” and “undemocratic”. Congress senior MP Digvijaya Singh was speaking when Kharge rose, leading deputy chairperson Harivansh to say that he had already been allowed to speak and that it was now his colleague’s turn.Kharge was not amused. “This is a dictatorship.

Delimitation will punish states that controlled population: Congress,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delimitation-will-punish-states-that-controlled-population-congress/articleshow/118908686.cms,"Jaisram Ramesh

NEW DELHI: In first remarks on delimitation since a fresh row on the fraught issue broke out last month, Congress Tuesday said states which achieved early success in family planning will lose seats because of the redrawing of constituencies as per the population criteria. The party said delimitation will “penalise” the states that worked in line with the national objective, listing key northern states as major gainers and southern and eastern states as losers.Congress spokesperson Jairam Ramesh said, “The distribution of seats across states in the Lok Sabha is presently based on the 1971 Census. Article 82 that was amended with effect from Feb 2002 provides for a fresh distribution based on the population data from the first Census after 2026.”He quoted a study done by Milan Vaishnav and Jamie Hintson in 2019, which distributed seats across the states based on the estimated population in 2026. As per its findings, Ramesh said, “The states that lose seats are Tamil Nadu (8), Kerala (8), Andhra Pradesh and Telangana (8), Odisha (3), West Bengal (4), Karnataka (2), Himachal Pradesh (1), Punjab (1) and Uttarakhand (1).” He added that Assam, J&K and Maharashtra will not gain or lose any seats. “The states that gain are Uttar Pradesh (11), Bihar (10), Rajasthan (6), Madhya Pradesh (4), Jharkhand (1), Haryana (1), Gujarat (1), Delhi (1), and Chhattisgarh (1).”Ramesh said the states that controlled population “will be penalised for it”.While Congress has in the past said that delimitation should not hurt the states which performed well in population control , this is its first remark after a controversy broke out following the red flag raised by Tamil Nadu last month. There has been a view that as a national party, Congress may prefer to play safe as opposing delimitation on population criteria may result in a backlash in the heartland states whose share would go up in such an exercise.DMK head and TN chief minister MK Stalin Friday wrote to his counterparts of southern states and Odisha, West Bengal and Punjab to be part of a Joint Action Committee launched for an “uncompromising fight against this unfair exercise”. He has also invited CPI(M), CPI, Congress, AIMIM, JD(S), Akali Dal, YSRCP, TDP, BRS, Jana Sena, TMC, AAP and BJP units of Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Punjab, Odisha and West Bengal for a meeting on March 22.",Congress said states which achieved early success in family planning will lose seats.

Later, a TMC delegation of 10 MPs marched to the Election Commission for a meeting with the poll panel. BJD also met the full bench of the EC to flag the issue.DMK MPs staged a protest in the Parliament complex against the three-language formula under the new National Education Policy and demanded that education minister Dharmendra Pradhan apologise for his remarks against the Tamil Nadu govt. Congress MPs from Tamil Nadu wore black in solidarity and joined the protest. DMK MPs raised slogans outside the House and carried posters saying ‘Tamil Nadu educates, BJP manipulates’. MDMK MP Vaiko alleged the three-language policy was aimed at destroying states.TMC leaders met the EC and alleged that Aadhaar cards were being cloned which could lead to the possibility of these being used for fake voter registrations. The party demanded that the EC issue a separate list of voter deletions, new additions and modifications with every new revised poll roll.Party MP Sagarika Ghose expressed scepticism over the poll panel’s recent statement assuring that the concerns would be addressed in three months. “This is an extremely serious issue.

TMC slams Suvendu for ‘dangerous and provocative’ remarks



KOLKATA: Bengal’s leader of the opposition Suvendu Adhikari sparked outrage on Tuesday by declaring BJP would “physically throw Muslim MLAs out of the assembly” after the party “forms the next govt” in the Trinamool-governed state that goes to polls in 2026.CM Mamata Banerjee ’s party protested the remark, terming it “hate speech” and questioning Adhikari’s “mental stability” after the defection of BJP’s Haldia MLA Tapasi Mondal to its ranks the previous day.Adhikari, who was suspended from the assembly on Feb 17 till the end of the budget session, labelled the Mamata govt “a communal administration that is behaving like the second version of Muslim League”. “The people of Bengal will uproot them this time,” he told reporters outside the assembly.The state BJP brass declined comment on Suvendu Adhikari’s remarks.Trinamool spokesperson Kunal Ghosh said it didn’t behove an elected representative to use such incendiary language against fellow legislators. “In Parliament or state assemblies, there can be debate and arguments. But to rake up religion and target MLAs belonging to a specific community is contrary to the principles of the Constitution. It’s dangerous, provocative and depraved. It’s also a criminal offence.”This isn’t the first instance of Adhikari’s statements causing unease even in his party. After BJP’s below-par performance in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls in Bengal, Adhikari had called for an end to the party’s ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’ slogan.“I will say ‘Jo hamare saath, hum unke saath’. We don’t need minority morcha,” he said, causing party colleagues to publicly disown the remark.","Bengal's leader of the opposition Suvendu Adhikari sparked outrage on Tuesday by declaring BJP would “physically throw Muslim MLAs out of the assembly” after the party “forms the next govt” in the Trinamool-governed state that goes to polls in 2026.

Don’t arrest Ranya’s husband, says HC

(Inputs from Rajiv Kalkod in Bengaluru)

BENGALURU: Karnataka’s Congress govt has ordered a probe into whether DGP (Police Housing Corporation) Ramachandra Rao had any role in the alleged gold-smuggling racket of his daughter and Kannada actress Ranya Rao. A one-man committee, led by additional chief secretary (ACS) Gaurav Gupta, will investigate the matter.Senior officers were reportedly unaware that a constable had escorted the actor -- with 14.2kg gold bars strapped to her body -- out of Bengaluru’s Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) when Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) officials intercepted her on March 3. She had arrived from Dubai and was arrested soon after.“Gupta’s inquiry will focus on the allegations against Rao, saying it was he who directed the constable to pick up Ranya. CID will probe alleged dereliction of duty by local police in the same episode,” a senior officer said. The move follows allegations by opposition BJP that the govt was shielding the big fish in the smuggling ring.Investigations revealed a violation of police protocol. Protocol staff told DRI officials that they had instructions to pick up Ranya. CBI has issued notices to four personnel from police protocol wing to explain why they were escorting Ranya out of the airport.Late Monday night, CBI sleuths raided Ranya’s Bengaluru flat and seized key documents. A special court for economic offences has adjourned hearing on Ranya’s bail petition to Wednesday. DRI sleuths had filed objections on Tuesday.Also under the scanner are Ranya’s brother K Rushab for possible links between the gold case and a multi-crore bitcoin scam being probed by a special investigating team (SIT) of the state police’s CID.“We need to know how payments were made for the purchase of 14.2kg gold carried by Ranya from Dubai. We are exploring all angles, including cryptocurrency,” a source said.Karnataka HC passed an interim order Tuesday barring DRI from arresting Jatin Vijayakumar Hukkeri, the husband of Ranya, without following the due process of law.

Karnataka to spend Rs 60 crore public funds on Cong workers’ salaries: BJP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/karnataka-to-spend-rs-60-crore-public-funds-on-cong-workers-salaries-bjp/articleshow/118905555.cms,"DK Shivakumar

BENGALURU: Karnataka’s Congress govt, already facing criticism for allocating Rs 52,000 crore to its five guarantee schemes, came under fresh attack from BJP, which alleged Rs 60 crore has been set aside annually for more than 4,000 Congress workers overseeing implementation of the plans at the state, district and taluk levels. Govt, however, hasn’t disclosed the size of the outlay.Govt informed the assembly Tuesday about salaries and sitting charges of guarantee scheme implementation panels. Soon, it triggered an uproar, with opposition parties slamming the move as a blatant attempt to reward Congress workers at taxpayers’ expense.Karnataka has constituted 38 panels to oversee the implementation of its guarantee schemes, with each panel comprising a chairperson, five vice-chairpersons, 31 members and a member-secretary. The chairperson of these panels will hold cabinet rank, while the vice-chairpersons will be given junior minister status.These panels will be provided offices at the state, district and taluk levels. The district panel chairperson will receive Rs 40,000 a month and the district vice-chairperson Rs 10,000. The taluk chairperson will receive Rs 25,000 a month and the BBMP chairperson Rs 40,000.In addition to salaries, sitting fees will be paid to members. At the district and BBMP levels, members will receive Rs 1,200 per sitting, while at the taluk level members will be paid Rs 1,100.Responding to JD(S) MLA MT Krishnappa, deputy CM DK Shivakumar defended the decision, asserting Congress workers were entrusted with overseeing the schemes.This intensified the opposition’s fury and BJP and JD(S) MLAs stormed the well of the House alleging Congress workers were being given undue control over the implementation of public welfare schemes. “Are we — the 224 MLAs and the bureaucracy — not competent to implement these schemes? Why is the state exchequer’s money being spent towards your (Congress) workers’ fun and frolic,” leader of opposition R Ashoka asked.Amid accusations that the panels were being used as a “rehabilitation” platform for Congress workers, Shivakumar said, “It is Congress workers who are responsible for bringing the party back to office in the 2023 assembly polls, and we intend to honour them with these postings.”Despite Speaker U T Khader’s attempts to defuse tension, the protests continued. Shivakumar said he would take the opposition’s demand to the cabinet and consider appointing local MLAs as panel heads, while Congress workers remained as members. However, his assurance failed to pacify the opposition, which continued its protest in the House.","Karnataka has constituted 38 panels to oversee the implementation of its guarantee schemes.

KOLKATA: State leader of the opposition Suvendu Adhikari sparked outrage on Tuesday by declaring BJP would ""physically throw Muslim MLAs out of the assembly"" after the party ""forms the next govt"" in Bengal that goes to polls in 2026.Trinamool spokesperson Kunal Ghosh protested the remark, terming it ""hate speech"". He said it was a criminal offence for constitutional post holders to make such remarks.He also questioned Adhikari's ""mental stability"" after the defection of BJP's Haldia MLA Tapasi Mondal to Trinamool the previous day.Adhikari, who was suspended from the assembly on Feb 17 till the end of budget session, labelled the Mamata govt ""a communal administration that is behaving like the second version of Muslim League"". ""The people of Bengal will uproot them this time,"" he told reporters outside the assembly.Bengal BJP netas refused to comment on Adhikari’s statements. Speaking to reporters, Trinamool spokesperson Kunal Ghosh said: “This is an extremely objectionable statement. The Bengal opposition leader can’t discriminate in the name of religion. He cannot say MLAs from a particular religion will be thrown out physically. This cannot happen... this cannot be said... This mentality is not good.”Ghosh added: “In Parliament or state assemblies, there can be debate and arguments. But to rake up religion and target MLAs belonging to a specific community is contrary to the Indian Constitution... Pushed to the wall, the leader of opposition is making such statements due to his mental instability. This is dangerous, provocative and depraved. It is also a criminal offence.”This is not the first time that Adhikari’s statements on religion have caused unease in his own party ranks.After BJP’s poor show in Bengal in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, Adhikari had called for an end to the ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’ slogan, saying: “Stop this ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’. I will say ‘Jo hamare saath, hum unke saath’. We don’t need Minority Morcha.”Bengal BJP netas had publicly disapproved of this comment.","State leader of the opposition Suvendu Adhikari sparked outrage on Tuesday by declaring BJP would ""physically throw Muslim MLAs out of the assembly"" Trinamool spokesperson Kunal Ghosh protested the remark, terming it ""hate speech"" He said it was a criminal offence for constitutional post holders to make such remarks.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118914688,imgsize-1229915,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/118914688.jpg"
