SC castigates Karnataka govt for case against BJP's Tejasvi Surya,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/court-castigates-siddas-govt-for-case-against-bjps-tejasvi/articleshow/122824607.cms,"Tejasvi Surya

New Delhi: In a rare instance, SC Monday castigated Karnataka govt for pursuing prosecution against BJP MP Tejasvi Surya for a post on X, ED for a PMLA case against Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah 's wife and an NGO for a contempt plea against Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee, and said courts are not platforms for politics.First was the turn of Karnataka govt which had filed an appeal against HC's decision to quash prosecution against Surya, who was accused of making a false claim about a farmer dying by suicide after his land was transferred to the state waqf board.Even before additional advocate general Aviskar Singhvi could place his argument justifying the filing of the appeal and necessity of prosecuting Surya, a bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran said, ""Do not try to politicise issues before a court. Political battles are to be fought somewhere else. Go before the electorate and fight your political battles.""When Singhvi attempted to justify the filing of the appeal by the state against BJP neta, the bench softened him by saying any further argument would invite heavy cost. Singhvi accepted the dismissal of the state's petition without further demurrer.Next in line to be chastised was ED that had appealed against a Karnataka HC order quashing a case under the PMLA against BM Parvathi in the Muda case.Next was the turn of NGO Atmadeep, which had sought initiation of criminal contempt against Banerjee for her reported public statement that SC's judgment quashing the scam-riddled recruitment of teaching and non-teaching staff would not be implemented. The bench gave senior advocate Maninder Singh an advice similar to those given to the Karnataka govt and ED. However, Singh said since initiation of contempt proceedings would require the attorney general's consent, the petitioner has approached the top law officer and is awaiting his response. ""Are you sure you will get the response,"" the bench asked and adjourned hearing on the petition.","In a rare instance, SC castigated Karnataka govt for pursuing prosecution against BJP MP Tejasvi Surya.

Why are you being used?""The bench was hearing ED's appeal against the HC order that quashed proceedings against Parvathi in the case related to the alleged irregular allotment of compensatory sites in posh areas of Mysuru in lieu of her low-value land acquired by Muda.Additional solicitor general S V Raju sought to justify ED's action but was stopped by CJI Gavai who said, ""Please don't open your mouth. If you do, we will be compelled to make some harsh comments...""The bench dismissed ED's petition and said, ""Thank you for saving your client (ED) from some harsh comments.""

It also quashed the summons issued to urban development minister B S Suresh, who was not named as an accused, but was called for questioning by ED.

The summons were stayed by the court on Jan 27.Siddaramaiah is also facing allegations of illegalities in allotment of 14 sites to his wife Parvathi by Muda. The CM, his wife, brother-in-law B M Mallikarjun Swamy, Devaraju - from whom Swamy had purchased a land and gifted it to Parvathi - and others were named in the FIR registered by Lokayukta Police establishment on Sept 27 last year following the order of the special court dealing with cases of MPs/MLAs.",The bench was hearing ED's appeal against the HC order that quashed proceedings against Parvathi.

Cash-at-home row: Justice Varma removal notices handed; LS may initiate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cash-at-home-row-justice-varma-removal-notices-handed-ls-may-initiate/articleshow/122823771.cms,"MPs submit notices for removal of Justice Varma to LS Speaker

‘Removal of judge will not be completed in current session’

NEW DELHI: Notices for the removal of Justice Yashwant Varma of Allahabad HC were submitted in both Houses of Parliament on Monday in what could potentially result in the first instance of a judge being benched for alleged misconduct.While 145 LS members, cutting across party lines, signed the notice, 63 members belonging to different parties made an identical move in RS. Sources said that both the Houses are on the same legal footing in this regard and proceedings are likely to be launched in Lok Sabha.According to the Judges (Inquiry) Act, when notices of a motion are submitted on the same day in both Houses, a committee to examine the charges levelled against the judge will be constituted by LS Speaker and RS Chairman.The notable signatories to the LS notice, submitted to Speaker Om Birla, included leader of the opposition Rahul Gandhi, BJP MPs Ravi Shankar Prasad and Anurag Thakur, NCP-SP’s Supriya Sule, Congress’s K C Venugopal and K Suresh, DMK’s T R Baalu, RSP member N K Premachandran and IUML member E T Mohammed Basheer.The notice signed by 63 opposition RS members was submitted to Upper House chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar who, before his shock resignation as vice-president, said he had received a notice for the removal of Justice Varma.“It has been signed by more than 50 members of the council of states. Thus, it meets the numerical requirement of signing by MPs for setting in motion the process of removal of an HC judge,” Dhankhar said.On law minister Arjun Ram Meghwal’s confirmation that a notice has also been submitted in LS, Dhankhar asked the RS secretary general to “take necessary steps in this direction”. Hours after the opposition move, BJP also collected signatures of its RS members and those from its allies to file a notice. BJP sources said the opposition-sponsored notice in RS prompted the party to act as it did not want to be left out of the exercise in the Upper House.Party sources said they had no idea about the opposition’s unilateral move as they cited their own bipartisan exercise in LS seeking signatures from all parties. Govt sources, however, confirmed that the matter will be taken up in LS first. Sources also confirmed that since the petition is set to be referred to a committee, the removal of the judge will not be completed in the current session.According to the Act, no committee shall be constituted unless the motion has been admitted in both Houses. The committee comprising a senior SC judge, a sitting HC chief justice and a distinguished jurist will then probe the charges levelled against Justice Varma and will be asked to come out with a report in three months.As sources indicated that LS is set to witness the motion first, this is the second time that a motion for the removal of a judge is being brought in the House after 32 years. In 1993, Justice V Ramaswami, an SC judge, faced a removal motion in LS.","Notices for the removal of Justice Yashwant Varma of Allahabad HC were submitted in both Houses of Parliament on Monday.

MUMBAI: CM Devendra Fadnavis expressed shock at the Bombay HC verdict quashing conviction of all 12 accused in the 11/7 train blasts case. “Bombay HC decision is very shocking. We will challenge it in Supreme Court,” he said.Speaking to the media in Mumbai late on Monday Devendra Fadnavis said, “The lower court gave a verdict, and in 2006, after the blasts, ATS caught the accused, collected evidence and presented it before the courts. I have not read the full (HC) judgment, but I discussed it with the lawyers and informed them it must be challenged in Supreme Court. We will go to SC at the earliest,” he said.BJP’s Kirit Somaiya, who has been advocating for the train blasts survivors, said the CM had assured him that the state would appeal against the verdict. “We are all shocked and pained by the verdict. I have spoken to CM Fadnavis. He has assured us the govt will seek help of top legal experts and an appeal will be filed as soon as possible,” said Somaiya, who had taken a group of survivors to meet additional chief secretary Iqbal Singh Chahal in Mantralaya Monday.“The lower court had awarded the death sentence. But there must have been some shortcomings in the investigation conducted in 2006.I am convinced SC will give us justice,” Somaiya added.Shiv Sena MP Milind Deora said on X, “As a Mumbaikar, I cannot accept the verdict of HC. In 2006, I was an MP from Mumbai and went and saw what happened in that terrorist attack. I appeal to Maharashtra govt that they should involve the best lawyers and appeal against the verdict as soon as possible.”Congress MP Varsha Gaikwad said on X, “Victims of the the train blasts must get justice. The CM should urgently intervene in this matter. An appeal must be filed in SC.” She added, “I think Maharashtra govt may not have done what we expected in terms of collection of evidence or appointment of public prosecutor.” Rohit Pawar from NCP (SP) said, “We will have to look at why HC gave this decision and whether the evidence fell short. Did state govt fall short in presenting its position?”","Devendra Fadnavis expressed shock at the Bombay HC verdict quashing conviction of all 12 accused in the 11/7 train blasts case. “Bombay HC decision is very shocking.

Former Mumbai top cop Anami Narayan Roy described the Bombay HC verdict as a “huge disappointment”. Roy was police commissioner when the blasts took place. “We had done highly professional work and there was very little scope for finding fault with our investigation,” Roy said.Roy said between the incident and HC verdict, the accused had approached the HC and SC on umpteen occasions, but there was no relief to them, and all along, the line chosen by Mumbai police and other law agencies was upheld. Roy said he was there before the trial court for a full five days at a stretch as an authority for granting permission for prosecution.","Former Mumbai top cop Anami Narayan Roy described the Bombay HC verdict as a ‘huge disappointment’ Roy was police commissioner when the blasts took place. “We had done highly professional work and there was very little scope for finding fault with our investigation,” Roy said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122823536,imgsize-161298,width-400,resizemode-4/122823536.jpg"

AGARTALA: Tripura chief minister Manik Saha announced Monday that his govt will strictly implement Citizenship (Amendment) Act of 2019, adhering to the cut-off date of Dec 31, 2014, for granting Indian citizenship to immigrants.His comments sharpened a growing rift with BJP's coalition partner Tipra Motha which has demanded recognition of all migrants entering after the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war as illegal - echoing the Indira-Mujib Accord.The party has set up district-level committees to flag suspected immigrants who are using forged papers.Tipra Motha chief Pradyot Kishore Debbarman has also pushed for a full revision of electoral rolls to identify undocumented immigrants. Election Commission has invited the party for a meeting on Wednesday.Saha drew a clear line: ""Only those who fled religious persecution in Afghanistan, Pakistan or Bangladesh and entered India by Dec 31, 2014, are eligible for citizenship under CAA. Anyone arriving after this date will be treated as an illegal migrant.""To curb infiltration, the state has formed an STF and directed district magistrates and police to ramp up surveillance.Saha said cooperation with border forces has sharply reduced illegal entries in recent months.Tripura is developing a separate system to manage those identified as illegal immigrants. It remains unclear whether detention centres - used in Assam - will be part of that framework.The immigration debate has intensified recently following West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee's accusation that BJP-led state govts are deporting Bengali migrant workers by labelling them Bangladeshi.PM Narendra Modi hit back at Trinamool Congress at a rally in Bengal's Durgapur, accusing the party of encouraging infiltration.",Tripura chief minister Manik Saha announced Monday that his govt will strictly implement Citizenship (Amendment) Act of 2019.

Red crusader and the last of CPM's founders: Ex-CM of Kerala VS Achuthanandan dies at 101,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/red-crusader-and-the-last-of-cpms-founders-ex-cm-of-kerala-vs-achuthanandan-dies-at-101/articleshow/122823332.cms,"VS Achuthanandan

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A singular chapter of Kerala 's red history turned its last page Monday. Former CM Velikkakathu Sankaran Achuthanandan - firebrand Marxist, CPM 's founding member, and Kerala's conscience-keeper - died aged 101 in a private hospital in Thiruvananthapuram at 3.20pm after 28 days on life support.VS, as he was known across political aisles, was hospitalised after a heart attack on June 23. Trusted comrades stayed by his side to the end. Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan rushed in for a final glimpse. Funeral will be held Wednesday evening in Alappuzha. Public homage begins Monday evening at AKG Centre in Thiruvananthapuram, continues Tuesday at Secretariat Durbar Hall, and concludes at Alappuzha Town Hall.Born on Oct 20, 1923, in Alappuzha to Velikkakathu Sankaran and Akkamma, he lost his mother at four and father at 11. Hunger cut short school at Class 7. The ""chovan"" (Ezhava) boy faced casteist jeers, but his resolve only hardened. At 21, he was organising Kuttanad farm workers. By 1940, he joined Communist Party. Jail, underground life, resistance - his early life reads like Kerala's own left-wing chronicle.Achuthanandan became CPM state secretary (1980-92), was elected to the assembly four times, and led the state as CM from 2006 to 2011 - the first working-class communist in India to do so.He twice served as opposition leader, and his loss at Mararikulam in 1996 polls shocked even his critics.His brand of politics was not of quiet obedience. He challenged CPM brass, openly taking on party honchos he dubbed ""crafty revisionists"". His feud with Pinarayi cost him a politburo seat. Yet he never broke from the party.He led anti-corruption crusades, exposed sex scandals involving ministers and film stars, and sent former minister R Balakrishna Pillai to jail. A green activist before the phrase existed, he battled land grab and paddy reclamation. Even in his 90s, he hired a tutor to learn Hindi after being named administrative reforms panel chief. Supporters called him the soul of CPM. With his passing, the last of the founding reds was gone.","Former Kerala CM Velikkakathu Sankaran Achuthanandan dies aged 101.
