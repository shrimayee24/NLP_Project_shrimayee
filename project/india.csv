"Student's rape on university campus shocks Chennai, parties bicker",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/students-rape-on-university-campus-shocks-chennai-parties-bicker/articleshow/116662507.cms,"CHENNAI: A 37-year-old man with a criminal record allegedly raped a second-year engineering student of Chennai's Anna University on campus after filming her with a male friend and trying to blackmail them with the footage.Suspect Gnanasekaran, who runs a roadside eatery near the campus, was arrested Wednesday, a day after the survivor called a police helpline to report the assault on her the previous evening.Amid an uproar over the alleged rape and lack of safety on campus, cops issued a statement saying varsity authorities and senior cops would jointly review potential security loopholes and plug these.Opposition members, including AIADMK general secretary Edappadi K Palaniswami, BJP state chief K Annamalai, PMK founder Dr S Ramadoss and AMMK chief TTV Dhinakaran, slammed the MK Stalin-led DMK govt for what they said was worsening security on educational campuses.State higher education minister Govi Chezhian said action would be initiated to ensure crimes don't recur. He said those trying to politicise the issue should not forget 2019 Pollachi sexual assault cases when AIADMK was in office.Investigators said the survivor was with her friend behind an old building in a desolate portion of the campus, close to Raj Bhavan and IIT Madras, when the crime occurred around 8pm on Dec 23.The complaint states that Gnanasekaran came up to the couple and claimed to have recorded their alleged intimate moments. He intimidated the male friend, a third-year student of the institute, into leaving the place and allegedly proceeded to rape the woman.Before fleeing, Gnanasekaran demanded to know the survivor's phone number and said she should meet him whenever he called her. He had been arrested in 2011 on the charge of sexually assaulting a woman on campus. It wasn't immediately known if the case went to trial. Police said there were still around 15 cases of theft and robbery against his name.Investigators have collected samples from the scene of crime and are searching for Gnanasekaran's mobile phone as they suspect that he may have stored pictures of several women on the device.","Suspect Gnanasekaran, who runs a roadside eatery near the campus, was arrested Wednesday.

AMRITSAR : The infighting within the Congress party continues to escalate, with two distinct factions emerging that are unwilling to reconcile which has prompted the intervention from senior party leaders to mediate and resolve the growing divisions ahead of election of Mayoral candidate even as the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), currently in second place, is reportedly working behind the scenes to turn the situation to its advantage and secure the mayoral position for itself.Having won 40 out of a total of 85 wards, Congress appeared poised to easily secure the mayoral position, with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) trailing behind with just 24 wards. The BJP, SAD, and independent candidates secured 9, 4, and 8 wards, respectively. However, a clear rift within Congress became evident when one faction of the party convened a meeting shortly after the election results were announced, a gathering from which the rival faction of Congress leaders chose to abstain.According to Congress sources, the party is currently divided into two factions. One group comprising former deputy chief minister OP Soni, along with Jasbir Singh Dimpa, Inderbir Singh Bolaria, etc. and others, is advocating for Soni's nephew, Vikas Soni , to be named the Mayor of Amritsar. The rival faction, which includes Congress leaders such as Dr. Raj Kumar Verka, Sunil Dutt, and Dinesh Bassi ,etc. has not yet proposed a specific candidate. Instead, this group is pushing for the election of a ‘worker’ as the Mayor .Sources further informed that with the support of seven AAP MLAs including five from Amritsar, one each from Attari and Jandiala, the AAP leadership is exploring the possibility of luring municipal councillors from the SAD, BJP, and even Congress to join their camp in a bid to secure the mayoral position. There are also reports of ‘councilor poaching’ attempts being made from various wards.“Our task is not as difficult as compared to Congress, they (Congress leaders) will not reconciliation given their personal interests and their bid to promote nepotism “ alleged a AAP leader seeking anonymity. “Congress may have a higher number but we have the government “ said he.Senior Congress leader and former senior deputy mayor of Amritsar, Raman Bakshi, alleged ""The practice of horse trading must come to an end. The government is engaged in such tactics.”Another senior Congress leader, who wished to remain anonymous, said, ""The Congress group that first convened the meeting of party leaders and winning municipal councillors made a wrong move, that prompted us to convene a meeting of our own group. The battle lines are now drawn. We will not allow any leader to promote nepotism and will instead advocate for a common party worker to be the Mayor of Amritsar, setting a positive precedent.”District Congress Committee president Ashwani Pappu denied acknowledging any rift in the Congress unit in Amritsar and maintained “The party high command will decide over the mayoral candidate”.Former Congress MLA and a senior leader Sunil Dutt said that Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) president Amarinder Singh Raja Warring and the Leader of Opposition Partap Singh Bajwa are coming on Thursday to review the situation and listen to the aspirations of winning municipal councillors to take the appropriate decision.","Congress appeared poised to easily secure the mayoral position, with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) trailing behind with just 24 wards.
