"Thank you & doodbye, Dr Sahab: Former PM cremated on a bitterly Cold, gloomy day, amid chilly vibes over memorial row",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/thank-you-doodbye-dr-sahab-former-pm-cremated-on-a-bitterly-cold-gloomy-day-amid-chilly-vibes-over-memorial-row/articleshow/116754253.cms,"All dignified, but no BJP-Cong interaction at cremation site

NEW DELHI: In life, he always seemed, rather charmingly, a little out of place when surrounded by the trappings of high office. Some, therefore, may have found it slightly ironic that the last journey of Manmohan Singh, who had once told his security official that he preferred a Maruti hatchback to a sleek BMW, was choreographed as per the ceremonial demands of a state funeral . But state funerals are mandated for ex-PMs.But even ex-PMs are a matter of politics. The state funeral happened with Congress and BJP still locked in a bad-tempered debate over a memorial site. Singh, whose baptism in politics was pretty rough and got rougher during his second stint as PM, wouldn't probably have been too surprised at this, had he had an inkling.Under a grey sky on a wintry morning, the cortege left the AICC office for the cremation site, with heavy bandobast all the way. This being a state funeral, armed forces had their part to play. There was a military band, and ceremonial marching. The CDS and the three service chiefs were present.At the AICC office, where it all began on Saturday, Congress members gathered in force to bid goodbye to one of the party's most consequential PMs. Singh's family members, wife Gursharan Kaur and daughters Upinder, Daman and Amrit were received by party president Mallikarjun Kharge, Sonia and Rahul Gandhi . Priyanka Gandhi Vadra was also present, along with party CMs, brass and workers.The cortege left for Delhi's oldest and largest crematorium,Nigambodh Ghat , after the singing of the national anthem at the AICC office. The pace was, as it always is on such occasions, stately, keeping in mind mourners walking alongside. There was a profusion of flowers. Some mourners were silent, others respectfully vocal. The latter joining in with the chanting of two, oft-heard memorialising slogans reserved for notable, departed politicians: ""Amar rahe"" and ""Jab tak suraj, chand rahega, tab tak tera naam rahega"". Congress was front and centre at Nigambodh, as was to be expected.Rahul Gandhi, Mallikarjun Kharge, party chief ministers Siddaramaiah, Revanth Reddy and Sukhwinder Sukhu, and other senior functionaries were at the gate of Nigambodh Ghat when the casket, draped in the Tricolour, was taken in. Laying of wreaths began once the casket was put on a raised platform.The long list of dignitaries present included, aside from Singh's family members, PM Narendra Modi, Amit Shah, the three Gandhis, Rajnath Singh, other NDA govt members, presiding officers of the LS and RS, Congress functionaries, Delhi CM and LG, and armed forces chiefs. Foreign countries were represented by Bhutan's king and a Mauritius minister.There was no noticeable interaction between BJP and Congress functionaries. But obviously unlike on X, where Saturday morning saw another bout between the parties, it was all dignified.The last rites began with Sikh priests reciting verses from Gurbani. Singh's daughter, historian Upinder Singh, lit the pyre, other family members beside her.Not too long after, the state funeral was over. But politics, of course, wasn't. A slogan raised from the crowd - 'MMS ko Bharat Ratna do' - was a reminder, if anyone needed reminding.","State funerals are mandated for ex-PMs. Congress was front and centre at Nigambodh, as was to be expected.

CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu BJP president K Annamalai on Friday whipped himself several times as a mark of protest accusing the DMK government of failing to protect the students of Anna University in Chennai.Annamalai accused the DMK government and police of leaking the victim's personal details and compromising her dignity, calling it a “shameful” act that reflected the administration’s incompetence.The BJP leader, who announced on Thursday that he would forego wearing footwear until the DMK is ousted from power, criticised the lack of CCTV surveillance at the university and questioned the state’s use of the Nirbhaya fund meant for women’s safety.“The FIR itself has exposed the victim’s identity and portrayed her in a poor light. This is a disgrace, and the DMK government must take responsibility,” he said, slamming law minister S Regupathy for defending the state’s actions.Annamalai also lambasted the police for their role in mishandling the case and demanded the removal of the Chennai police commissioner or the deputy commissioner involved. Declaring an end to public protests that often result in arrests, he urged BJP cadres to stage demonstrations at their homes.The BJP chief further announced plans to observe a 48-day fast and visit the six Arupadai Veedu (Lord Muruga’s six abodes) to “complain to Murugan” about the state’s deteriorating governance.“This kind of dirty politics leaves no room for respect or healthy debate.

In a strong statement, Nadda condemned Rahul Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge's statements claiming that the Congress party, which failed to honour Singh during his lifetime, was now exploiting his legacy for political gain.""It is indeed very unfortunate that former Congress president Rahul Gandhi and current president Mallikarjun Kharge are not refraining from doing politics even on the sad demise of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh,"" Nadda remarked.He alleged that the Congress had consistently disrespected Singh, citing the party’s actions during his tenure as prime minister.

In a post on X, Rahul Gandhi criticised the government for disrespecting the former PM and highlighted Singh’s legacy. The BJP, in turn, slammed Rahul’s comments as a “new low in India’s politics.”Leader of opposition in the Lok Sabha, Rahul, also criticised the deviation from tradition, arguing that Singh deserved a memorial to honour his contributions. Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also backed Rahul, and said that the government should have looked ""beyond politics"".Broadening his criticism, Nadda accused the Gandhi family of consistently sidelining influential leaders from both within the Congress and beyond. ""The Gandhi family has neither given respect to any big leader of the country nor done justice to them,"" Nadda said, naming Sardar Patel, PV Narasimha Rao, and Pranab Mukherjee as examples of leaders who were allegedly neglected by the party.Contrasting this with the BJP’s approach, Nadda highlighted the respect shown by the Modi government. ""The government under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given place for PM Manmohan Singh's Samadhi and has also informed the family,"" he noted, accusing Congress of spreading misinformation on the matter.He also recalled Sonia Gandhi’s rejection of a proposal to build a memorial for PV Narasimha Rao at Rajghat, stating, ""It was Prime Minister Narendra Modi who established a memorial for him in 2015.""

Coal block allocation scam case against Manmohan Singh to abate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/coal-block-allocation-scam-case-against-manmohan-singh-to-abate/articleshow/116752365.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former PM Manmohan Singh 's desire to clear his name of a small blot, being summoned by a Delhi court as an accused in an alleged irregular coal block allocation case, remained unfulfilled. It would have helped him maintain his widely perceived squeaky clean antecedents.Shortly after Supreme Court cancelled the irregular allotment of coal blocks during UPA govt led by Singh and directed trial court to proceed with the trial in several such cases under Prevention of Corruption Act , a Delhi court had in March 2015 summoned the ex-PM as an accused in the alleged irregular allotment of Talabira-II coal block to Hindalco.Singh rushed to SC challenging the summoning order, fearing the ignominy of standing as an accused before the trial court. An SC bench led by V Gopala Gowda on April 1, 2015 stayed the summoning order much to the relief of the ex-PM and admitted his petition, which meant it required a detailed hearing of the plea.The trial court had issued summons to Singh despite CBI filing a closure report in the alleged irregular allotment of Talabira-II coal block to Hindalco. The trial judge had said that closure of the case by CBI was unwarranted as there was prima facie evidence to summon Singh, who held the charge of coal ministry at the relevant time, and industrialist Kumar Mangalam Birla and others as accused.Though SC had stayed the summoning order against Singh, a bench led by Justice Madan Lokur refused to stay the summoning of former minister of state for coal, Santosh Bagrodia, and said his petition would be heard along with that of Singh's on Sept 2, 2015.Alarmed by SC's decision to expedite hearing on Singh's appeal, senior advocate Kapil Sibal requested then CJI H L Dattu for an urgent clarification - that Singh's petition should not be categorised as a coal scam related case as the main thrust of his challenge was to the constitutional validity of Section 13(1)(d)(iii) of PC Act.CJI Dattu agreed with Sibal and ordered de-tagging of Singh's petition from Bagrodia's appeal.The CJI Dattu-led bench said Singh's petition would be listed forbearing only when his counsel seeks out of turn hearing on completion of pleadings - filing of response by CBI and Centre and a rejoinder by the ex-PM. Much after his retirement, Justice Dattu had confided with TOI that he could not entertain the eventuality of a ""very clean ex-PM"" facing trial as an accused in a case that had its genesis in his party's political decisions.The petition would now be disposed of as infructuous as the petitioner has passed away.","Former PM Manmohan Singh was summoned by a Delhi court as an accused in an alleged irregular coal block allocation case.

It issued guidelines to lower courts to strictly comply with Section 309 CrPC and Section 346 of Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, which mandates completion of trial within two months of filing of chargesheet. The bench also instructed the registry to forward the judgment copy for monitoring compliance. Also, it directed appointment of competent prosecutors and, if necessary, state-funded defence lawyers for the accused.Justice Govinda Sanap, while hearing appeals, noted grave lapses in over 60 cases. ""The mandate of Section 309 has not been complied with even in a single trial. The mandate has been thrown to the wind and evidence recorded in a piecemeal manner.
