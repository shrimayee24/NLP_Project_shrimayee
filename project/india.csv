Revenue minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule said CM Devendra Fadnavis took ""serious cognisance"" of the case involving a farmer from Nagbhid, Roshan Kule, in Chandrapur district who alleged that harassment by private moneylenders forced him to sell his kidney in Cambodia. ""The CM constituted an SIT to probe this deeply disturbing incident. Action was already initiated against those involved in illegal money lending, and the concerned moneylenders were arrested,"" he said, adding ""stricter action will follow and no guilty person will be spared.""As the probe gathered pace, another case of alleged financial exploitation emerged from Brahmapuri, highlighting what police described as the expanding footprint of illegal money lending in the district.A private firm employee complained that after borrowing Rs 8.5 lakh, he was allegedly forced to repay Rs 31.42 lakh, pledging gold, liquidating investments and mortgaging his house. Police registered a case against moneylender Laxman Urkude under provisions of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita and the Maharashtra Money-Lending (Regulation) Act. Urkude is also an accused in the Kule case.Earlier, the farmer Roshan Kule of Minthur village borrowed Rs1 lakh, but the amount allegedly ballooned to several lakhs due to usurious interest. He was subsequently taken to Cambodia, where one of his kidneys was removed through an illegal transplant, and later sent to Laos on the pretext of employment. ""This case involves exploitation of vulnerable farmers and points to a larger organised network,"" Bawankule said.Chandrapur police formed the SIT led by additional superintendent of police, Ishwar Katkade, with senior officers from local crime branch and cyber police included in the team.",The Maharashtra govt has set up a special investigation team (SIT) to probe the Chandrapur kidney racket.

Interpol Blue Notice Explained: How CBI Tracks Absconding Luthra Brothers In Goa Nightclub Fire Case

NEW DELHI: Advocate Vishnu Joshi, representing a victim’s family in the Goa nightclub fire case, on Wednesday said that one of the Luthra brothers requested a Dunlop mattress during police remand.Joshi explained that the court carefully considered the brothers’ health claims before granting custody. Speaking to reporters, he said, “Today, when the Goa Police presented them in court, one accused, during their arguments, claimed he had spinal issues and other health problems. He requested that they be provided with a Dunlop mattress during their police remand. The state strongly opposed this... Their pre-medical examination showed them to be perfectly fit. ”He added that the duo had attempted to evade legal proceedings since fleeing India.“Since these people (Luthra brothers) absconded and fled the country, they have been employing tactics to somehow escape. First, they filed an anticipatory bail application on vague grounds in the Rohini Court, even though that court had no jurisdiction... But that bail application was rejected. Since then, they have been trying wherever they get a chance to obtain some kind of relaxation,” Joshi said.Joshi explained that the court carefully considered the brothers’ health claims before ordering custody.“The brothers claimed to be suffering from back pain. The court considered all submissions and directed the police to first conduct a pre-medical examination and re-examination. No medical necessity was found, following which the court, exercising its full authority, granted five days of police remand,” he said.The Luthra brothers, owners of the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub in Arpora, were remanded to five-day police custody by the Mapusa Judicial Magistrate First Class (JMFC) court.They were brought back to Goa from Thailand following their deportation and produced before the court after undergoing multiple medical examinations.After landing at Manohar International Airport, Mopa, under police escort around 10.45 am, the duo was taken to a primary health centre in Siolim and then to the District Hospital in Mapusa. The court directed fresh medical examinations before ordering the five-day custody to allow investigators to question them regarding alleged safety lapses at the club.The blaze broke out on December 6 around 11.45 pm during a crowded event at the nightclub, when electric firecrackers allegedly struck the wooden ceiling. The incident claimed the lives of 25 people, including tourists and staff, while several others were injured.Police said the brothers fled India hours after the incident on December 7, leaving for Thailand while rescue operations were under way. Goa Police launched a nationwide and international manhunt, issued a lookout circular and sought an Interpol Blue Notice.Following their detention by Thai authorities for illegal stay and the suspension of their passports, the brothers were deported to India on emergency travel documents.They landed at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport on Tuesday and were arrested by Goa Police, who obtained a 48-hour transit remand from a Delhi court to facilitate their return to Goa.They have been booked under several provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, including culpable homicide not amounting to murder and negligence. Investigators have also arrested several others linked to the nightclub’s operations and are probing allegations that the venue was operating with expired licences and without mandatory safety clearances.","Advocate Vishnu Joshi, representing victim's family, says one of the Luthra brothers requested a Dunlop mattress during police remand.

KOLKATA: PM Narendra Modi took his case on CAA and voter identity concerns to X hours after leaving Kolkata Saturday. He also targeted Trinamool Congress over the chaos at Salt Lake Stadium during Lionel Messi's visit and infiltration from Bangladesh.At 6.25pm, Modi wrote that weather prevented him from addressing a planned rally in Nadia district: ""There are other issues too, which I would have raised at Ranaghat, but because of the weather, I couldn't join the rally in person.""On CAA, Modi posted: ""I assure every Matua and Namasudra family that we will always serve them. They are not here at the mercy of TMC. They have the right to live in India with dignity thanks to the CAA, which our govt brought. We will do even more for the Matua and Namasudra communities once a BJP govt takes oath in Bengal.""Modi also targeted Trinamool over the Messi mess. ""The people of West Bengal have endured a lot in recent years. The condition of West Bengal's Nari Shakti is deeply distressing. A football-loving state like West Bengal was shamed courtesy the TMC. The recent incident has broken the hearts of so many football-loving youth,"" he wrote.Accusing Trinamool of shielding infiltrators, he wrote: ""Look at the extent of TMC's affection for infiltrators - their supporters say 'Modi Go Back' but fall silent when it comes to saying 'Infiltrators Go Back'.""Trinamool struck back swiftly. Rajya Sabha member Derek O'Brien said: ""A migratory bird flew in today but did not reach his destination. Forgot his script. Tried to do late-night damage control. Hope he will do better next time."" He added that BJP had built the Ranaghat meeting as one where Modi would dispel Matua anxieties. ""The PM could not reach there, but he did speak to them. He could not say anything concrete. So after Trinamool called out the facts, the PM is now in damage control mode. But now his X statements mean nothing during the SIR process.""TMC said Modi's earlier ""sile-nce on CAA"" showed he had ""come empty-handed, with no message to dispel SIR worries in the Matua heartland"", while Bengal BJP mounted a loud CAA pitch.

'Maha Jungle Raj in Bengal, Mamata Shielding Infiltrators': PM Modi Blasts TMC in Virtual Rally

KOLKATA: PM Narendra Modi used a fog-forced virtual rally in Bengal Saturday to pursue two parallel damage-control efforts - shoring up support among Matua voters unsettled by an electoral roll revision and repairing political fallout from his recent ""Bankim da"" reference in Parliament.PM Modi was to address a public meeting at Taherpur in Nadia district but his helicopter could not land because of heavy fog. He returned to Kolkata airport and spoke virtually for 18 minutes.The Matua community - electorally crucial in Nadia and North 24 Parganas - has shown signs of unease over EC's special intensive revision of electoral rolls. At the same time, Trinamool Congress has targeted Modi and BJP over his Lok Sabha reference to Bankimchandra Chattopadhyay as ""Bankim da"", calling it proof that the party was culturally alien to Bengal.Calling Bankimchandra Chattopadhyay ""Rishi Bankim babu"", Modi praised the author of 'Anandamath' and creator of ' Vande Mataram ', saying Bengal and Bangla had enriched Indian history and culture. ""Vande Mataram was one such contribution and the entire nation is celebrating its 150th anniversary,"" he said. ""Bengal was blessed with a sage like Rishi Bankim babu, who sowed seeds of emancipation in British-ruled India.""He paid tribute to Matua icons Harichand Thakur, Guruchand Thakur and Baroma, praising the community for ""taking their philosophy of social development forward"" and crediting Harichand Thakur with teaching ""the virtue of karma"".He also invoked Sri Chaitanya, describing him as an icon of love and compassion.Modi linked SIR to infiltration, an emotive subject in border districts adjoining Bangladesh, including Nadia and North 24 Parganas. ""I can see them shouting 'go back Modi' slogans,"" he said, referring to TMC supporters. ""But they are tight-lipped when it comes to saying 'go back' to infiltrators. The infiltrators, who are trying to control Bengal, are close to Trinamool's heart. That is why they are trying to save infiltrators and opposing SIR. ""The speech did not directly address Matua fears linked to SIR. In Nadia, more than 2.7 lakh voters - over 6% of the electorate - have been flagged as ""unmapped"", unable to establish linkage with the 2002 voters' list. In North 24 Parganas, over 7 lakh voters - about 8.8% - fall in that category. Matua elders say a substantial share of those numbers belongs to their community.BJP functionaries acknowledged Matua support played a major role in the party's strong performance in 2021 assembly polls and 2024 general elections, and have issued assurances to calm anxieties. Some senior members privately expressed surprise that Modi did not directly engage with the issue.Modi also pitched BJP as the sole alternative for Bengal's development after virtually inaugurating construction of a four-lane highway. He contrasted NDA's landslide victory in Bihar with what he called ""mahajangalraj"" in Bengal, blaming Trinamool for stalled growth.",PM Modi was to address a public meeting at Taherpur in Nadia district but his helicopter could not land because of heavy fog.

We will have an alliance with like-minded parties. I spoke to Prakash Ambedkar over the phone, and a party delegation will meet him on Sunday to discuss the details.""Varsha Gaikwad said, ""Our motto will be to fight for vikash (development), not for vivad (dispute). We are against the divisive politics of caste, religion, region, and language. Pollution in the city and corruption in the BMC are among the key issues we will highlight in the election.""Chennithala added, ""We will bring a chargesheet on corruption in the BMC and will also bring a manifesto document for the city, outlining what we will do once we win the election in the BMC.""Chennithala held a separate meeting with the Maharashtra Congress chief Harshwardhan Sapkal and other state netas to discuss the election strategy in other places. He insisted that wherever the local functionaries express willingness to have an alliance with other parties, including MVA partners, they will be allowed to decide.
