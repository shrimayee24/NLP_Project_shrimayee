PATNA: BJP and JD(U), two key NDA partners in Bihar, have differed on the upcoming assembly election schedule. While BJP has urged the Election Commission (EC) to conduct polling in a maximum of two phases to reduce expenditure and disruption, JD(U) has called for a single phase, citing the good law and order situation in the state and the return of Bihar migrants during the Chhath festival, which could boost voter participation.A majority of frontline political parties in Bihar on Saturday suggested the EC to hold the assembly elections in a maximum of two phases, saying that minimal phases would be less tiring and reduce election-related costs.The suggestions came during an interaction with the full team of the Election Commission, comprising chief election commissioner (CEC) Gyanesh Kumar and election commissioners Sukhbir Singh Sandhu and Vivek Joshi, at a hotel here. The team arrived Friday night for a two-day visit to review preparations for the elections and oversee the implementation of electoral measures. The EC is expected to announce election dates after returning from Patna.While parties such as BJP, RJD, CPI-ML and LJP (Ram Vilas) favoured a maximum of two phases, the JD(U), led by CM Nitish Kumar, proposed a single phase, citing no law and order issues and stressing voter participation.They highlighted that many Bihar migrants return home for Chhath and their involvement could be crucial.“We have suggested conducting elections in a single phase since the law and order situation in Bihar is good. Naxalism is also not an issue in the state. If elections can be held in a single phase in Maharashtra, why not in Bihar?” JD(U) national working president Sanjay Kumar Jha told reporters. He also recommended holding elections around Chhath and advised the EC to ensure adequate paramilitary deployment at sensitive polling booths.The BJP argued for a maximum of two phases. “The elections should be completed in a maximum of two phases since conducting this task in multiple phases increases poll expenditure and also affects development works,” state BJP president Dilip Kumar Jaiswal said. He also demanded proper checking of identity for burqa-clad women voters and sufficient deployment of security forces to ensure full participation.RJD called for two-phase polling but sought video recording of postal ballot counting and action against officials favouring any party. “But what is serious is that the Bihar govt is crediting money to the bank accounts of women and farmers ahead of the announcement of polls, which is equivalent to bribing the voters. The EC must instantly take cognizance and initiate action,” RJD leader Chitranjan Gagan said. He also asked for details of 21.53 lakh new voters added to the list.“We demanded that the polling should be conducted in minimal phases, but at the same time, adequate deployment of security forces be made for free and fair elections,” LJP (RV) spokesperson Rajesh Bhatt said, adding the EC should provide potable water and toilet facilities at polling booths for female voters.The Congress said the number of phases was immaterial. “What matters is transparency during the voting process,” national spokesperson Abhay Dubey said, requesting details of 21 lakh new voters, as well as dead voters and women removed from the list.CPI-ML also supported two-phase polling but urged sufficient security deployment in booths dominated by Dalits, OBCs, extremely backward classes and weaker sections. “Conducting polling in multiple phases allows the ruling parties to transport fake voters to their destination centres. So polling must be held in a maximum of two phases only,” party functionary Kumar Pervez said.The EC team is in Patna for two days to assess poll preparedness. The term of the 243-member Bihar assembly ends on Nov 22. The last assembly elections in 2020 were held in three phases under Covid restrictions while 2015 and 2010, polls were held in five and six phases, respectively.","BJP and JD(U), two key NDA partners in Bihar, have differed on the upcoming assembly election schedule.

NEW DELHI: The seat-sharing negotiations for upcoming assembly elections in Bihar have become more complex as two new parties - Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and Pashupati Paras's LJP faction - joined the Mahagathbandhan alliance. The situation is getting trickier as major parties are firm on their seat demands.The 243 seats will now be divided among eight parties -- Rashtriya Janata Dal, Congress, CPI, CPM, VIP, LJP (Paras) and JMM.“Two more parties are expected to be part of the INDIA bloc soon and we all have to sacrifice our share of seats to accommodate the new partners.” State Congress president Rajesh Kumar told reporters after a discussion during a key meeting of INDIA bloc leaders at the official residence of RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav.Meanwhile, Congress insist that it cannot go below the 70 seats.VIP chief Mukesh Sahani, on the other hand, has demanded “60 seats plus the post of deputy CM” while the CPI-ML is pressing for at least 40 seats, pointing to its past performance.The RJD is also unwilling to contest on fewer than 150 seats.In 2020 assembly elections, Rashtriya Janata Dal had contested on 144 seats, of which it won 75.Congress won 19 out of 70 seats.CPI-ML contested 19 seats and won 12.CPM contested 4 seats and was successful in winning 2 seats.CPI contested on 6 seats and won 2 seats.RJD's Tejashwi Yadav has already declared himself as the CM face of the opposition INDIA bloc.Addressing the rally in Ara town, the last stopover of the 'Voter Adhikar Yatra', Tejashwi questioned the Nitish Kumar government in Bihar for ""frequently copying his ideas"" and described it as a ""copycat government"". Ridiculing the government for copying his ideas, he said that at present he was moving ahead while the govt was behind him.""Tejashwi aage-aage, Sarkar pichhe-pichhe. Original CM chahiye ki duplicate?"" (Tejashwi is moving ahead while the govt is following him from behind. Do you want a duplicate CM or the original CM?), Tejashwi asked the crowd.","Two new parties - Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and Pashupati Paras's LJP faction - joined the Mahagathbandhan alliance.
