In 2020, the party retained power with 62 seats, while the BJP won the remaining eight. Congress, once again, failed to secure a single seat.AAP and Congress each have fielded 70 candidates, whereas, BJP has contested 68 seats, leaving two for its allies—Janata Dal (United) and Loktantrik Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas).In total, 699 candidates entered the fray, including 603 men, 95 women, and one third-gender contestant.

LIVE: Joint Press Conference | Constitution Club Of India, New Delhi

NEW DELHI: Leader of opposition in Lok Sabha and Congress MP Rahul Gandhi , along with Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut and NCP-SCP MP Supriya Sule , on Friday alleged discrepancies in the voter list for the recently concluded Maharashtra elections .Addressing a joint press conference in the national capital, Rahul claimed that the opposition had uncovered ""many irregularities"" after scrutinising voter data.Rahul said, ""We represent on this table - the entire opposition that fought the last election in Maharashtra. We are going to bring some information about the election. We studied the details - the voters and the voting list. Our teams have been working, and we have found many irregularities.""Highlighting the numbers, the Congress leader alleged that while 32 lakh voters were added over five years between the 2019 Vidhan Sabha elections and the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, a 39 lakh voters were included in the rolls within just five months between the Lok Sabha elections and the Vidhan Sabha elections.""The question is, who are these 39 lakh voters? That is equivalent to the total number of voters of Himachal Pradesh. The second point is, why are there more voters in Maharashtra than the entire voting population of the state? Somehow, the voters have been suddenly created in Maharashtra,"" he alleged.Rahul further accused the Election Commission of ignoring repeated requests to investigate the anomalies. ""We have been saying to the Election Commission that we are finding anomalies. We need the voter list—names and addresses of the voters of Maharashtra. We need the voter list of the Lok Sabha election. We need the voter list of the Vidhan Sabha election. Because we want to understand exactly who these new additions are,"" he said.He also alleged that many voters, particularly those belonging to Dalit, tribal, and minority communities, had been deleted or relocated to different polling booths. ""There are many, many, many voters that have been deleted. Voters who are in one booth have been transferred to another booth. Most of these voters come from Dalit communities, tribal communities, and minority communities,"" Rahul said.""We have made repeated requests to the Election Commission. They have not answered us. The leader of the opposition has said this in Parliament House. The Election Commission has not responded. Now, the only reason they would not respond is that there is something wrong with what they have done. I am not making any accusations. I am presenting data here clearly,"" he added.Responding to Rahul’s remarks, the Election Commission of India (ECI) said in a post on X, ""ECI considers political parties as priority stakeholders, of course, the voters being the prime & deeply values views, suggestions, questions coming from political parties. Commission would respond in writing with full factual & procedural matrix uniformly adopted across the country.""Responding to Rahul Gandhi's allegations, Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said, ""Election Commission has categorically replied to all the questions. Rahul Gandhi is doing a cover fire as he knows that after the February 8, Delhi Election results, his party will be nowhere in Delhi and hence, what he will speak on that day, how he will create a new narrative, he is practising for the same. If Rahul Gandhi does not introspect and will continue to console himself with lies - his party's revival isn't possible. Rahul Gandhi should introspect his defeat.""","Rahul Gandhi, along with Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut and NCP-SCP MP Supriya Sule, on Friday alleged discrepancies in the voter list for the recently concluded Maharashtra elections.

The development comes a day ahead of the counting of votes in Delhi.The visit by ACB officials follows a directive from Delhi Lieutenant Governor V K Saxena, who ordered a probe into Kejriwal’s claims. The move came after the BJP wrote to the LG, demanding an investigation and an FIR, calling the allegations made by the AAP chief “very serious in nature.”Earlier, Arvind Kejriwal accused the BJP of attempting to poach 16 AAP candidates by offering them ministerial positions and Rs 15 crore each if they defected.AAP MP Sanjay Singh, reacting to the ACB’s visit, said, “More than 16 people have been threatened. We have disclosed one phone number. We are going to file a complaint at the ACB office. Why is the ACB creating drama instead of taking action? All details will be revealed during the investigation.”The probe was initiated after the Delhi LG’s principal secretary wrote to the chief secretary, directing an ACB inquiry into AAP’s allegations.Meanwhile, AAP legal head Sanjeev Nasiar said that ACB officials left from Arvind Kejriwal's residence. He said, ""When the ACB team came here, they didn't have a notice, but after taking instructions from someone, they have served us a notice. We will reply to the notice in a proper way.

Law department officials said this should happen within the next week and before the budget session starting in early March.According to the CMO, Gehlot raised concerns that the ordinance could negatively impact microfinance, which plays a crucial role in providing credit to poor.

NEW DELHI: In a few hours on Saturday, the fate of a high-octane electoral contest for Delhi's 70 assembly seats will be known. While the contest to form the next govt is largely considered to be between the incumbent AAP and BJP, which has sat in the opposition since 1998, Congress might disrupt the calculations of the two with a surprise or two.The counting of votes will begin at 8am and the broad trends will be available as early as 10.30am.By 1pm, Delhi may well know who will govern the city for the next five years.While AAP and Congress fielded 70 candidates each, BJP contested 68, leaving two to its two allies, Janata Dal (United) and Loktantrik Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas). But there were 699 candidates in total - 603 men, 95 women and a third-gender contestant. Over 60.5% of voters, or 9,451,997 of 15,614,000 electors, visited the polling stations on Feb 5.Delhi's chief electoral officer, R Alice Vaz, said the electronic voting machines were secure in 70 strong rooms, each for one assembly constituency, under multi-layered security across 19 locations.Most exit polls have predicted a close contest, with BJP given the edge in terms of seats and vote share. Winning a minority 28 seats, AAP formed the govt with the outside support of Congress in 2013, which lasted only 49 days. The subsequent election in 2015 saw the party gain a massive mandate with 67 of 70 seats in its kitty. In 2020, AAP reprised its triumph, winning 62 seats while BJP got the remaining eight. Congress again failed to open its account.None of the parties are laying any store by the exit polls. AAP senior Saurabh Bharadwaj told reporters on Wednesday that the exit polls had similarly predicted defeat in 2013 and 2015 and victory in 2020 but with fewer seats. ""Exit polls have always shown AAP getting fewer votes. But in several areas of my constituency, people stopped their vehicles to tell me AAP would win,"" he claimed.AAP sought a third term based on its performance in health, education, water and other sectors, including providing free power and water to frugal consumers and free bus rides to women in public transport. It has promised more welfare schemes for women, senior citizens and other sections of society.Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva exuded optimism of his party being elected with a huge margin. ""Our victory will be more spectacular than what exit polls show,"" he asserted on Friday. BJP, which has been out of office for nearly 26 years, assured it would continue the welfare schemes already implemented and proposed several new benefits for various sections of society. It also promised bigger development with a ""double-engine govt"".Delhi Congress president Devender Yadav said his party fought a very good election whatever the exit poll said. ""Our efforts will be converted into a vote bank.

When I demanded the cancellation of the 2021 recruitment exam, my concerns were ignored. Now, CID personnel have been stationed at every corner to keep an eye on me, and my phone is also being tapped,"" he says in the video.Congress latched onto the controversy, demanding CM Bhajan Lal Sharma's resignation on grounds that home dept reports to him and subjecting a minister to phone tapping is an offence.Meena's absence from the assembly's ongoing budget session fuelled talk of a rift in BJP, although minister of state for home Jawahar Singh Bedam contested the surveillance allegations.Bedam kept mum when the opposition demanded to know if and when an inquiry would be instituted.Parliamentary affairs minister Jogaram Patel attempted, albeit unsuccessfully, to make light of the row by harking back to the phone-tapping allegations against previous Congress govt when former dy CM Sachin Pilot revolted against then CM Ashok Gehlot in July-Aug 2020.The uproar in assembly led to multiple adjournments as opposition MLAs refused to let go of the opportunity to target treasury benches each time the House reassembled. On Feb 3, parliamentary affairs minister Patel informed the assembly that Meena had excused himself from the session, citing a health issue.Congress MLAs said the cabinet minister had fallen out with BJP brass, leading him to excuse himself from assembly session. Meena's office clarified that he wasn't unwell and had formally communicated the reason for his absence to the party.Late Friday, Patel convened a presser on the assembly premises to dispel what he termed ""rumours"" about Meena's phone being tapped by the govt. ""The minister has already clarified in the assembly that no phone tapping has taken place. I will meet my cabinet colleague (Meena) soon to hear his grievances, if any,"" he said.A party functionary admitted that Meena's allegation was ""yet another embarrassment for the state govt"".","Rajasthan agriculture minister Kirori Lal Meena accused his own govt of snooping on him, including phone tapping, in retaliation for flagging suspected corruption in police recruitment.
