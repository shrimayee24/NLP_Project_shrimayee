"Campaign ends in Maharashtra, Jharkhand; Results set to shape NDA, INDIA bloc narratives",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/campaign-ends-in-maharashtra-jharkhand-results-set-to-shape-nda-india-bloc-narratives/articleshow/115429505.cms,"(With inputs from Mumbai and Ranchi)

NEW DELHI: Campaigning came to a halt on Monday for high-stakes assembly polls in Maharashtra and the second phase in Jharkhand on November 20, the two states being more than just electoral battles for BJP and Congress, leaders of their respective alliances, with results poised to shape their political narrative and future trajectory. The match-up follows BJP's stunning come-from-behind victory in Haryana and has increased the stake for Congress and its allies to win the two battles in order to regain the momentum they seemed to have after paring down BJP's Lok Sabha tally.BJP obviously wants to build on the advantage it grabbed in Haryana.In Maharashtra, BJP, through its Mahayuti alliance with Shiv Sena (Shinde faction) and NCP (Ajit Pawar faction), is aiming to hold on to the state. The state had witnessed significant political realignments, with splits within its major political entities, creating a complex chessboard for parties to manoeuvre.BJP has highlighted its governance through development projects and economic policies. The 'Ladki Bahin' scheme was a centrepiece, promising financial assistance to women, aiming to capture the support of this significant voter demographic.Urban areas like Mumbai saw BJP campaign on law enforcement and anti-terrorism, while also subtly promoting its cultural nationalist agenda to consolidate Hindu votes with slogans like 'ek hain to safe hain' and 'batenge to katenge'. BJP has positioned itself as the stable anchor of Mahayuti, promising governance free from the turbulence of internal party disputes.BJP on Monday launched a new ad campaign attacking the opposition MVA and urging people to 'say no to Congress'. The campaign highlighted various incidents from the past, including the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks, and the lynching of sadhus in Palghar when Maha Vikas Aghadi was in office. BJP is contesting 149 seats, Shiv Sena 81 and Ajit Pawar-led NC for the 288-member House.MVA was well ahead of the Mahayuti in Lok Sabha polls and the alliance is hoping that the momentum is carried forward into these elections.The polls, moreover, will determine which is the real Shiv Sena and the real NCP, so a lot is at stake for Eknath Shinde, Uddhav Thackeray, Sharad Pawar and Ajit Pawar. It is because of the decisive nature of this poll that Uddhav has been harping on the 'gaddar' (betrayer) line to draw the sympathy vote, while Pawar Sr has been urging voters not just to defeat his nephew's NCP but to defeat it big.",Campaigning came to a halt on Monday for high-stakes assembly polls in Maharashtra and the second phase in Jharkhand.

While the campaigning for current round of polls ended on Monday, polling is set to be held on Wednesday, followed by counting of Saturday.This means that by the time the parties' replies land at EC's door, the assembly polls and bypolls would already be over, leaving no scope for any election curbs. It remains to be seen if EC will deem the violations serious enough to warrant an FIR.The Congress had complained against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah for allegedly labelling Congress as anti-SC/ST/OBC, and sought a ban on campaigning by the two for the remainder of the campaign period. The BJP on the other hand complained to EC about Congress MP Rahul Gandhi's remarks during campaign alleging that BJP was promoting RSS, letting Gujarat take away key investment projects from other states and also compromising the independence of Constitutional and statutory bodies like EC, CBI, ED etc. It had sought a restraint on Rahul ""handing out"" such ""lies"" and demanded an FIR against Rahul and Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge in this regard.","The Election Commission has granted the BJP and Congress an additional week to submit their respective comments on complaints filed against one another.

At the same time, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Andhra Pradesh were allotted much more, he said, questioning the ruling Mahayuti's silence on this disparity.Gadgil also criticised the government's approach to drug control, pointing out that there has been a significant rise in drug seizures while PM Modi promised a ""drug-free India"" by 2047.","Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge urged voters in Maharashtra to defeat leaders who he alleged had accepted substantial bribes to change allegiance.

The results will be declared on November 23, along with Maharashtra.In the Tribal-dominated state, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and CM Hemant's Soren Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) are in a direct fight, while the Congress party and Lalu Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) are in alliance with the JMM.The JMM-Congress-RJD alliance are also reportedly seeking to deal with Left parties, Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party and other tribal outfits that have been contesting the elections in the state as independent entities and make efforts to field candidates against the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) on all 81 seats collectively.In the last assembly polls in 2019, the JMM-Congress-RJD alliance won a comfortable majority of 47 seats in a House of 81.The BJP slipped to 25 seats from 37 it held in 2014. The poor performance was perceived to be the outcome of its decision to contest alone backfiring. The party did not foster an alliance with the Ajsu in the 2019 polls when Raghubar Das, currently the Odisha governor, was serving the state as CM.In this year's Lok Sabha polls in Jharkhand, the BJP-led NDA secured nine out of the 14 seats, with the BJP winning eight and its alliance partner, the Ajsu (All Jharkhand Students Union) Party, retaining its single seat.On the other hand, the opposition India bloc improved its tally, increasing its seat count from two in 2019 to five in the parliamentary polls.BJP and JMM have spruced up their pace of campaigning from the ground zero to social media. BJP and JMM leaders are actively rebutting and challenging each other on a range of issues, including illegal immigration, youth welfare, employment and housing.INDIA bloc parties in Jharkhand slammed the EC for holding assembly elections in the state along with that of Maharashtra but claimed that they were ready to slug it out with BJP-led NDA, which has welcomed the announcement of poll dates.JMM, Congress, and CPI (ML-L) said the announcement showed that EC was in a hurry to conduct elections though the assembly tenure was due to end in January next year.Also, both the INDIA bloc and BJP-led NDA are expected to get into huddles to discuss the modalities of seat-sharing which is going to be a challenge for both the competing teams.","The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections, which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra. Elections in Maharashtra will be held in single phase on November 20. The counting of votes will be on November 23.Maharashtra is gearing up for elections as the two major political alliances—the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) and the Mahayuti—prepare to face each other for the first time in a Vidhan Sabha election.The Maha Vikas Aghadi, comprise of the Congress, the Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray), and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) under Sharad Pawar, will go head-to-head with the Mahayuti , which includes the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Shiv Sena faction led by Eknath Shinde, and the NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar. This will be the first electoral contest between these two alliances since the splits within the Shiv Sena and NCP.The MVA is hopeful of replicating its recent Lok Sabha success, while the Mahayuti aims to retain power by leveraging its populist schemes targeted at women and youth. Both alliances have set their sights on winning the state.Narayan Rane, a former Union Minister and the victor in the Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg Lok Sabha constituency, is poised to be a key figure for the BJP in the Konkan region during the forthcoming elections. Meanwhile, two constituencies are expected to be critical battlegrounds: chief minister Eknath Shinde's Kopri-Pachpakdi seat in Thane City and Worli in Mumbai, where Aaditya Thackeray, a leader of the Shiv Sena (UBT), is seeking reelection.In the last Vidhan Sabha elections in 2019, the BJP secured 26.1% of the votes, the Congress 16.1%, the NCP 16.9%, and the Shiv Sena 16.6%. The BJP and the Shiv Sena (then united) formed the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which secured a majority. However, the coalition soon crumbled due to disagreements over government formation, plunging the state into a political crisis.After no party could establish a government, Maharashtra was placed under President's rule. Devendra Fadnavis was briefly sworn in as chief minister, with Ajit Pawar as deputy chief minister.
