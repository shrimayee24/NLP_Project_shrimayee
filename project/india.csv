What is our fault if groom flees before marriage: MP CM on Cong candidate's withdrawal in Indore,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/what-is-our-fault-if-groom-flees-before-marriage-mp-cm-on-cong-candidates-withdrawal-in-indore/articleshow/110047512.cms,"INDORE: Taking a dig at the Congress over its Indore Lok Sabha seat candidate withdrawing from the fray at the last moment, Madhya Pradesh chief minister Mohan Yadav has said it was not his party's fault if the ""bridegroom fled before the wedding"". The Congress received a jolt in Indore after its candidate Akshay Kanti Bam withdrew his nomination on April 29, the last date of withdrawal, and later joined the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ).""The Congress claimed that the BJP did something wrong in Indore. What was our fault? It is like inviting the entire village to the wedding feast and the groom running away before the marriage ceremony,"" Yadav said at the BJP's campaign rally at Betma near here on Saturday.The opposition party, which has no candidate left in the fray for the May 13 election in Indore, is insulting democracy by appealing to local voters to press the NOTA (None Of The Above) button, the chief minister said.""If someone's child runs away from home, whose fault is it? They are your children, you should take care of them,"" he said.Yadav also participated in a roadshow in Indore city in support of BJP candidate and sitting MP Shankar Lalwani.Terming the opposition INDIA bloc as ""Ghamandiya"" alliance, Yadav evoked the epic Ramayana and the city of Lanka, the capital of its arch-villain Ravan.""These arrogant people were born in Lanka 17 lakh years ago during the time of Lord Ram. Due to the bankruptcy of their intellect, they posed as fake saffron-clad (monks) to abduct Sita,"" the chief minister said during the roadshow.Calling upon the voters to reject the Congress' appeal to opt for NOTA, he said, ""Mother Sita made the mistake of crossing the 'Lakshman Rekha,' but the people of Indore should resolve that they will not cross the Lakshman Rekha under any circumstances.""Taking a swipe at state Congress president Jitu Patwari, who hails from Indore, Yadav said after suffering defeat at the hands of BJP candidate Madhu Verma in Rau seat in the district in the last year's assembly elections, Patwari was scared of contesting the Lok Sabha election.On the other hand, even some 80-year-old Congress leaders were contesting the election, he added.Referring to Congress leaving the Khajuraho Lok Sabha constituency to the Samajwadi Party as part of a seat-sharing agreement, Yadav claimed that it showed the Congress was afraid of elections.","Madhya Pradesh chief minister Mohan Yadav has said it was not his party's fault if the ""bridegroom fled before the wedding"" The Congress received a jolt in Indore after its candidate Akshay Kanti Bam withdrew his nomination on April 29, the last date of withdrawal, and later joined the BJP.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110047607,imgsize-786428,width-400,resizemode-4/110047607.jpg"
‘Will fulfil PM’s vision of Viksit Bharat’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-fulfil-pms-vision-of-viksit-bharat/articleshow/110047198.cms,"BJP, candidate from Kanpur City Lok Sabha seat, Ramesh Awasthi, is upbeat about the party’s prospects and is confident that the party would come out with flying colours in the elections. In an interview with Rajiv Srivastava, he rubbished claims of being an “outsider” and said that he would work for ‘Viksit Kanpur’ on the lines of PM Narendra Modi’s ‘ Viksit Bharat ’ call. Excerpts:





How is your poll campaign progressing?

It’s going well. The people-friendly schemes started by PM Narendra Modi have reached the ground level. The common man is very excited.

What is your agenda for the Kanpur Lok Sabha seat if you win the polls?

I will work for ‘Viksit Kanpur’ to fulfil the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Viksit Bharat Mission, 2047.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister

Yogi Adityanath

want all-round

of Kanpur. My aim is to restore the past glory of the city.

Opposition parties are claiming that you are an outsider as you belong to Farrukhabad, and you were seeking a ticket from Banda earlier. What do you have to say?

Congress had raised this issue.

Is Rahul Gandhi contesting from Rae Bareli as an outsider or a native of Rae Bareli? What is the actual definition of an outsider? I have been residing in Kanpur since 2010. I did my LLB in 1996 from Kanpur. Since then, I have also been active in Kanpur student politics.

I have my home in Swaroopnagar locality of Kanpur. I organise programmes like mango parties and Holi Milan in which people and members of all parties participate.

Were you not elected student union president of a degree college in Farrukhabad?

It is true that I was into student politics in Farrukhabad. There is no doubt that I was born in Farrukhabad, and I completed my initial schooling there. Lekin meri karmbhoomi Kanpur hai (my workplace has been Kanpur). Since 2010, I have been residing permanently in Kanpur.

I am a member of the BJP working committee representing Kanpur for the last five years. This issue is only being raised through the media.

Your nearest rival and Congress candidate Alok Misra is from Kanpur. Of the five assembly constituencies falling in Kanpur City Lok Sabha constituency, three assembly constituencies have MLAs from Samajwadi Party, including Mohd Hasan Rumi from Kanpur Cantt, Amitabh Bajpai from Aryanagar and Haji Irfan Solanki from Sisamau. How will you overcome these challenges?

There is no doubt that three assembly constituencies are with Samajwadi Party. There were some issues due to which the SP MLAs won from these three seats by a narrow margin. But in the last Lok Sabha polls, the BJP won from Aryanagar assembly segment. The BJP also won mayoral elections.

We are now regularly winning from these seats. In Lok Sabha polls, the candidate’s role also becomes significant. In the last general election, Congress had two prominent faces, Shriprakash Jaiswal and Ajay Kapoor. Now that Ajay Kapoor is in BJP, he has come with his vote support and Jaiswal is no longer active in politics. Congress is left with nothing.

How will you check the division of votes of specific castes?

There is no impact of the Opposition candidate in the city. Name one leader from any caste who is supporting the Congress candidate.

Barring his family vote, the Congress candidate will not even get the support from the staff of the school which he owns.

There is feedback that the BJP local unit is not happy with you.

This claim is baseless. I am a member of the BJP working committee from Kanpur. Each office-bearer of the district unit is with me. Can anyone name even one organisation office-bearer not working to ensure the victory of BJP in Kanpur?

People are saying you are overconfident. Is it so?

No BJP worker is overconfident.

We say what we see on the ground. Each voter is with Modi and

Yogi

in Kanpur. We have good support in Sisamau and Aryanagar.

On April 22, BJP's Mukesh Dalal was declared elected unopposed from Surat after all other candidates, including one from the BSP, withdrew their nominations.Due to a pre-poll alliance with Congress, the AAP had not fielded its candidate from Surat. Kumbhani had gone incommunicado since April 22. He was later suspended by the Congress, which blamed him for the rejection of the nomination form and also accused him of ""connivance with the BJP"".

We will act decisively and take back PoK,” Shah said.Shah’s remarks at an election rally in Chevella, Telangana , were in response to Aiyar’s statement that Pakistan has the nuclear bomb and therefore a cautious approach has to be adopted.Shah said the late former PM Atal Behari Vajpayee had conducted the Pokhran-2 nuclear test. The first was conducted by Indira Gandhi’s govt in 1974.The home minister also scoffed at Telangana chief minister A Revanth Reddy’s remarks that the surgical strikes on Pakistan “did not even kill a crow”. “PM Modi’s swift decision had resulted in terrorists in Pakistan getting wiped out in the surgical strikes,” he said.Later in the day, he told reporters that after the BJP-led NDA forms govt at the Centre for a third time, it would make sure the 4% reservation for Muslimsin Telangana is scrapped.“The fact is that reservation for Muslims is affecting the reservation for other sections, so we will scrap them,” he said. He also said Congress and BRS were spreading canards that BJP was against reservation for SCs, STs and OBCs. “We have never said we will remove reservations for SCs, STs and OBCs,” he said in Hyderabad.On the final day of campaigning for the Lok Sabha elections in Telangana, which goes to polls on May 13, Shah said, “Whichever party is in power, it is AIMIM’s Asaduddin Owaisi who holds the steering wheel.

NEW DELHI: The campaigning for the fourth phase of Lok Sabha elections , scheduled for May 13, came to an end on Saturday evening followed by the commencement of a 48-hour silence period. A total of 1,717 candidates are in the fray for the lower house of Parliament from 96 constituencies across 10 states and Union Territories.During the runup to the fourth phase of polling, PM Modi continued his onslaught on Congress over the issues of corruption and wealth redistribution.Meanwhile, the opposition INDIA bloc stuck to its 'save democracy' plea, and got a major morale boost after the Supreme Court granted interim bail to Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal till June 1.All 25 seats in Andhra Pradesh and 17 constituencies in Telangana will go to polls in this phase. Polling will also take place in 13 seats in Uttar Pradesh, 11 in Maharashtra, 8 in West Bengal, 8 in Madhya Pradesh, 5 in Bihar, 4 each in Jharkhand and Odisha as well as one seat in Jammu and Kashmir.All eyes will be on UP's Kannauj as Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav is in the fray from this seat. The former chief minister of Uttar Pradesh will be contesting against Bhartiya Janata Party's Subrat Pathak.Meanwhile, Trinamool Congress' leader Mahua Moitra will also be contesting from the Krishnanagar constituency. Hyderabad is also bracing itself for the big showdown between Bharatiya Janata Party candidate Madhavi Latha and sitting All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen MP Asaduddin Owaisi for the Lok Sabha election.The run up to the fourth phase polling saw the Election Commission and Opposition INDIA bloc entering into a spat over delay in release of voter turnout data. The poll body accused Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge of creating impediments in the conduct of free and fair elections and said that Kharge's allegations are unwarranted, without facts and ‘reflective of a biased and deliberate attempt to spread confusion’.During the campaigning, Congress chief Kharge and Rahul Gandhi also targeted Prime Minister Modi after he accused the grand old party of receiving ""tempo loads of money from Adani and Ambani"" in exchange for Gandhi's silence on the issue.Former Congress president replied to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's allegations and challenged the PM to initiate a CBI or ED investigation into the matter.Moreover, Prime Minister Narendra Modi continued his onslaught against the INDIA block and attacked the Sharad Pawar and Uddhav Thackeray factions of NCP and Shiv Sena and claimed that ""duplicate NCP and Shiv Sena"" have made up their minds to merge with the Congress after the June 4 Lok Sabha election results.Additionally, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal got a huge relief amid the ongoing Lok Sabha elections as Supreme Court granted him bail till June 1 for campaigning. Kejriwal has been lodged in Tihar Jail in an alleged money laundering case in connection with the now-scrapped Delhi Excise policy.The Lok Sabha polls are set to unfold in seven stages over a 44-day period.

Speaking at an election rally in Bargarh, western Odisha, Modi asked, “You tell me who runs the BJD govt. Do you know that the entire govt has been outsourced? There is a super-CM who is above MLAs elected democratically and the CM elected by MLAs. Do you want Odisha to fall into the hands of someone who doesn’t understand Odisha? Whose responsibility is it to save Odisha?”“I have not come here for BJP’s benefits. I have come here, requesting you with folded hands. Please save my Odisha. Odisha is getting ruined. Such a great state with great culture and tradition lost 25 years. In the past five years, outsiders have totally captured Odisha,” he said.“Tell me if the sons and daughters of Odisha are capable of leading the state,” he asked. On a two-day visit, the PM addressed three rallies, the others being at Phulbani (Kandhamal) and Balangir.In Balangir, Modi claimed Naveen could not name 10 villages of Kantabanji, from where he has been contesting, without reading it from a piece of paper. “He is cut off from ground realities,” the PM said. Stating that the countdown for a BJD govt in Odisha had started, Modi said, “Gaje Baaje ke Saath Vida Kijiye (Send them packing on a celebratory note).”Claiming that Odisha’s culture is in danger under the current BJD govt, Modi said many eminent Odia personalities, such as Veer Surendra Sai, Gopabandhu Das, Harekrushna Mahtab and Biju Patnaik, must be very sad seeing the state of affairs. “Odia asmita (self-respect) can’t be mortgaged to someone like this,” he said, an indirect reference to Tamil Nadu-born VK Pandian’s rise in BJD.",Modi claims that Odisha is controlled by outsiders who have taken over the state in the last five years.

They are looking for buyers. They are unable to sell,” Modi said, adding, “Because of Congress’s weak approach, people in Kashmir suffered from terrorism for 60 years.”Later, speaking in Jharkhand and attacking Congress MP Rahul Gandhi in particular, Modi said the number of seats Congress would win would not even equal Gandhi’s age.In Odisha, recalling that India conducted nuclear tests (Pokhran 2) on this date (May 11, 1998), when Atal Bihari Vajpayee was PM, Modi claimed that it was for the first time after Independence that people across the globe looked at an Indian leader with the utmost respect. India’s first nuclear test was conducted by Indira Gandhi’s govt in 1974.Speaking at an election rally at Phulbani, under Kandhamal Lok Sabha seat, Modi said: “This was the day when India demonstrated its strength to the world.” He added, “On the other side, there is the thought of Congress party. Time and again, Congress tried to frighten our own country. They say be cautious. Pakistan has atom bombs. These dead people also kill the heart of the country. Congress has always adopted such an attitude.”“Instead of giving them a befitting reply, Congress used to hold meetings with terror outfits. Congress feared annoying vote banks,” he alleged.Later, speaking at Murve Maidan in Simaria, Jharkhand, Modi said the alliance and the local JMM-Congress govt was full of corruption. Accusing the JMM-Congress-RJD govt of running an opium industry in Chatra, he said people should not vote for them if they want to secure the future of their children.“Mountains of cash are being recovered from JMM and Congress leaders.

If so much money is there with the PA and his servant, one can imagine the amount of black money held by ministers,” he said.“One leader of the alliance partner has offered to merge with Congress after declaration of the results.

Kharge-EC war of words rages: Cong chief asks why no action against ‘communal’ remarks by BJP leaders,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kharge-ec-war-of-words-rages-cong-chief-asks-why-no-action-against-communal-remarks-by-bjp-leaders/articleshow/110042132.cms,"NEW DELHI: Taking exception to the language of the Election Commission ’s letter to him, Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge has written to the commission asking why they have not taken action against “blatantly communal and cateist” statements made by BJP leaders. He said the Congress “is on the side of the commission and stands for its strength and independence” but “it is for the officials of the Commission to now decide where they stand.”Kharge pointed out that the letter that he had written earlier this week, even though an open letter, was clearly addressed to the INDIA bloc partners and not the EC.He expressed “surprise” that the EC wanted to respond to this letter while ignoring several other complaints given directly to it. Asserting that he has certain “misgivings about the language of the letter” that the EC has addressed to him, Kharge took a dig at EC as he added that he would not press on that issue as he understands “the pressures they (EC) are working under”.On Friday, Congress had termed EC’s response to Kharge‘s letter as a “permanent blot” on the face of a body, which is there to “ensure a level-playing field to all political parties”.Kharge in the letter, he wrote to INDIA bloc parties earlier this week, underlined the “inordinate” delay in the release of final voter turnout of first two phases and a jump of around 5.5% over the initial projection. In an unusual move, the EC responded to Kharge's open letter rejecting his allegations around voter turnout data as “baseless.”Questioning the EC, Kharge asked on Saturday that “the lack of urgency shown by the Commission in taking action against blatantly communal and cateist statements being made by the leaders of the ruling party that vitiates the electoral process seems puzzling.”“I am also puzzled by the need to write that the ‘Commission is not legally bound to publish any voter turnout data at aggregate level of a constituency or state’, though it is factual,” he added. Kharge said that he is sure that many voters would be surprised too. “Many voters who are deeply interested in the elections would also like to see the absolute number of votes polled to be put out in the public domain by the Commission directly,’ he said.He concluded by expressing disappointment and said, “it should be our collective endeavour to safeguard democracy and protect the independent functioning of the ECI.”",Mallikarjun Kharge has written to the commission asking why they have not taken action against “blatantly communal and cateist’ statements made by BJP leaders.

Pankaja in fight to stay relevant in Maha’s politics,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pankaja-in-fight-to-stay-relevant-in-mahas-politics/articleshow/110046281.cms,"Caught In Caste Calculus

Tough Match With

Camp

Much At Stake For Munde Heir

CHHATRAPATI SAMBHAJINAGAR (AURANGABAD): Until last June, Pankaja Munde had her eyes on Maharashtra’s Parli assembly seat that her cousin and NCP member Dhananjay Munde had snatched in 2019. That loss and her earlier remark: “I am the CM in people’s mind” had led to her “isolation” within the state BJP, so starting the groundwork 17 months before the state polls was understandable.But when Dhananjay and some other NCP legislators led by Ajit Pawar joined the Mahayuti (BJP plus chief minister Eknath Shinde’s Shiv Sena) govt last year, Pankaja withdrew her claim on Parli, and rumours of her candidature from Beed Lok Sabha seat whirled.Finally, on March 13, BJP declared Pankaja its Beed candidate in place of her younger sister Pritam.Beed is a water-starved constituency where many take up the traditional job of sugarcane harvesting. Lack of industrial development has halted its growth, and the district headquarters is still without a rail link. It is also a constituency plagued by caste divisions.The Maratha demand for reservation has soured relations with OBCs, who fear losing a share of their quota. In fact, Beed was the only Maharashtra district that saw widespread violence during last year’s Maratha agitation .Pankaja, daughter of late BJP MP and former state deputy CM Gopinath Munde , is the party’s OBC face , and her campaign convoy has been stopped by ‘protesters’ at least a couple of times recently, although she’s said she favours a separate Maratha quota. “My opponents are trying to polarise voters in the name of caste. I am, however, keen to take people from all castes and creeds along,” Pankaja said at a recent campaign rally.She’s found endorsement from Union minister Nitin Gadkari, who told people at a rally, “You can come to me seeking solutions to road infrastructure problems only if you vote for Pankaja.”Keeping the caste factor in mind, Sharad Pawar’s NCP (SCP) has renominated Bajrang Sonawane, a Maratha who was vice chairman of Beed zilla parishad and, briefly, deputy CM in Ajit Pawar’s camp. Sonawane got the ticket because he had bagged more than 5 lakh votes in the 2019 LS poll that he lost to Pritam Munde.Sonwane recently said the Beed contest with Pankaja would be a cakewalk for him. “There is no neck-and-neck fight. My opponent is in no position to put up a tough contest as she is hardly available in Beed.”His state unit chief Jayant Patil accused BJP of failing to develop the constituency. “We are confident that MVA – Congress, NCP (SCP), Shiv Sena (UBT) alliance – is winning at least 33 Lok Sabha seats, including Beed. We will have to send Bajrang to Delhi for the district’s development.”Attacking the Munde family, Sonawane said, “Vaidyanath cooperative sugar mill, controlled by the Mundes, went bankrupt. Sugarcane growers, transporters and cane cutters have not been paid. Before splurging on their poll campaigns, the Munde cousins should answer these people.”Gopinath Munde died in an accident on June 3, 2014 and Pankaja has been seen as his political heir. She was cabinet minister from 2014 to 2019 in the Devendra Fadnavis-led BJP govt. But she’s been without a seat since her loss in 2019, and analysts say this poll is a test of her relevance in Maharashtra’s political landscape.Pankaja has her cousin Dhananjay’s support this time, and it could bolster her prospects. “Differences with Dhananjay are a thing of the past. We were together even before Lok Sabha elections were announced,” she said.BJP’s Maratha stalwarts like MLC Suresh Dhas, ex-MLC Amarsinha Pandit and Nilanga MLA Sambhaji Patil Nilangekar have shown their support for Pankaja to prevent run-ins with quota supporters.As for the ‘audacious’ remark that isolated her and caused a ‘rift’ with former CM Devendra Fadnavis, Pankaja says, “My statement was read out of context... I never expressed a desire to become CM on any platform. My differences with Fadnavis are also hearsay.”With her house finally in order, Pankaja might not be watching her back, but she needs all her focus for the May 13 duel, which is a Munde-Sonawane and BJP-NCP (SCP) re-match with the extra dimension of OBC vs Maratha this time.",Pankaja Munde is the daughter of late BJP MP and former state deputy CM Gopinath Munde. She was cabinet minister from 2014 to 2019 in the Devendra Fadnavis-led BJP govt. But she’s been without a seat since her cousin Dhananjay Munde snatched her Parli assembly seat.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110046345,imgsize-814149,width-400,resizemode-4/110046345.jpg"

Modiji will turn 75 on Sept 17 next year. Modiji himself made a rule in BJP in 2014 that anyone in the party who reaches the age of 75 will retire,” Kejriwal said at a media interaction.“So I ask BJP, who is your PM candidate ? If they form govt, they will first tackle (UP CM) Yogiji. Then, Modiji’s most favourite, Amit Shah, will be made PM. So I want to alert the people of the country, Modiji is not asking for votes for himself, he is seeking votes to make Amit Shah PM. I want to ask Modiji and Amit Shahji, who will fulfil Modiji’s guarantees? Will Amit Shah do it?""Shah immediately responded by saying that Kejriwal was unnecessarily celebrating the prospect of Modi hanging his boots after turning 75 and the PM was not going anywhere. “I want to tell Arvind Kejriwal & co and the entire Indi Alliance, you don’t have to be happy about Modiji turning 75. This is not written anywhere in BJP’s constitution. Modiji will complete his term and continue to lead the nation. There is no confusion in BJP about this,” Shah said in the first forthright assertion that PM was not bound by the 75-year cutoff that was brought in 2014 by the larger saffron leadership to phase out veterans who were adjudged to have reached their ‘sell-by’ political date.Shah’s statement that the 75-year rule does not apply to Modi only confirms what was already known. The decision to ‘retire’ veterans like Advani reflected the consensus in the Sangh Parivar about the diminution of their capacity to contribute to the cause. In contrast, Modi is seen as the talisman, with his popularity surpassing even BJP’s in many parts and sections.Kejriwal’s statements triggered a string of reactions from other senior BJP functionaries as well, including defence minister Rajnath Singh and party chief J P Nadda. “The INDI Alliance, which is unable to decide on its leadership is speculating unsuccessfully about our leadership... INDI alliance leaders do not have even an ounce of the acceptability and credibility that Modi has among people,” Singh said.“Modi is our leader and will continue to lead us in the future,” Nadda said. “The leader who has come out of jail also knows that ‘aayega to Modi hi, rahega to Modi hi’ (only Modi will be voted to office, and he will remain there)”.","Delhi CM and AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal fired his first salvo on Saturday.

"Rahul Gandhi moots debate with PM Modi; he’s merely an MP, mocks BJP",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rahul-gandhi-moots-debate-with-pm-modi-hes-merely-an-mp-mocks-bjp/articleshow/110043683.cms,"NEW DELHI: Reacting to Rahul Gandhi ’s call for a face-to-face debate on Lok Sabha elections with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP on Saturday questioned his knowledge of poll issues as well as his standing in Congress party, noting that he is neither the president of his party nor the leader of opposition in Parliament.At a press conference, BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi asked in what capacity is Gandhi looking to debate with Modi as he is merely an MP of his party.The remark comes as Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday said he or party chief Mallikarjun Kharge would be pleased to participate in such a discussion and expressed hope that PM Modi would also take part. “It would be a positive initiative for the major parties to present their vision to the country from one platform for a healthy democracy,” Rahul wrote on X. He also added that the nation expects Modi to participate in the debate.Rahul’s post was in reply to Justice (Retd) Madan B Lokur, Justice (Retd) Ajit P Shah and senior journalist N Ram, who had written to him and the PM earlier this week, inviting them to a platform for a debate on the key election issues.“Congress welcomes this initiative and accepts the invitation for a discussion,” Rahul said. “We agree that such a debate will help people understand our respective vision and enable them to make an informed choice. It is also critical to put to rest any unsubstantiated allegations attributed to our respective parties. As the principal parties fighting the election, the public deserves to hear from their leaders directly. Accordingly, either myself or the Congress President would be pleased to participate in such a debate,” he added.In the invite addressed to PM Modi and Rahul, it was pointed out that the PM has publicly challenged Congress on reservations, Article 370 and wealth redistribution. On the other hand, Kharge has questioned the PM on possible “mutilation” of the Constitution, electoral bond scheme and the govt’s response to China and also challenged him to a public debate. In this backdrop, a debate will help the citizens to hear directly from the political leaders, the invite said.","Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday said he or party chief Mallikarjun Kharge would be pleased to participate in such a discussion. “It would be a positive initiative for the major parties to present their vision to the country from one platform for a healthy democracy,” Rahul wrote on X.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110043668,imgsize-51232,width-400,resizemode-4/110043668.jpg"

Now, the Delhi police are after you for circulating a fabricated and edited video of mine and that scaring you,” Shah said at a rally in Chevella, Telangana, in support of a BJP candidate on the last day of campaigning.Delhi police had registered a case on April 28 over the doctored video showing Shah advocating the abolition of reservation for SCs, STs and OBCs, and issued summons to Revanth to appear on May 1, which he skipped. A couple of days ago, Revanth, who is also party Telangana unit president, said: “Amit bhai is trying to scare me and using his ministry to do so. If a political party produced a doctored video against another party or leader, the party concerned has to complain.

They are interested because they are connected. Youth from Telangana serve in the Army to protect the country’s borders.

Lok Sabha elections: Arvind Kejriwal hits trail running with roadshow today,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lok-sabha-elections-arvind-kejriwal-hits-trail-running-with-roadshow-today/articleshow/110024119.cms,"NEW DELHI: The campaign of Aam Aadmi Party and INDIA bloc for Lok Sabha elections in Delhi and other states has got a shot in the arm with Arvind Kejriwal set to join it from Saturday.Given interim bail by Supreme Court solely for the purpose of elections, the Delhi chief minister is losing no time in hitting the campaign trail. He will participate in a roadshow in south Delhi on Saturday along with his Punjab counterpart, Bhagwant Mann.Kejriwal draws big crowds to his public events and will be the star campaigner for his party. In his absence, the party’s Delhi state convener, Gopal Rai, and his cabinet colleagues, Saurabh Bharadwaj and Atishi, had stepped in. His wife Sunita’s roadshows were drawing crowds but couldn’t compare with Kejriwal’s chemistry with audiences.An important constituent of INDIA alliance , AAP has fielded 22 candidates in five states. The party is contesting on four seats in Delhi as part of a seat-sharing arrangement with Congress and on two each in Gujarat and Assam and one in Haryana. It has gone solo in Punjab and is contesting all 13 seats.While voting in Assam and Gujarat is over, Delhi and Chandigarh will go to polls on May 25 and Punjab on June 1. A senior party functionary said Kejriwal is likely to spend most of his time campaigning till May 23 – the last day of campaigning for the sixth phase of elections on May 25 – and will also go to Kurukshetra in Haryana. Since Punjab will go to polls in the seventh phase on June 1, the AAP chief may address rallies and participate in roadshows there after May 23.“To show solidarity with the INDIA bloc, Kejriwal may intermittently go to other states where the alliance partners are giving a tough fight to BJP and campaign for them,” said the party functionary. “We will soon draw up a plan for his campaign after speaking to other alliance partners and keeping their requirements in mind. The leaders of other parties would surely like to come to Delhi and campaign for AAP and Congress here.”The party is also likely to coin a new name for the campaign. After Kejriwal’s release on interim bail, AAP functionaries started using “Modi can’t stop Kejriwal” as a catchphrase.Another AAP functionary said Kejriwal coming out of jail will prove to be a “gamechanger” for the INDIA group. He claimed the Delhi CM is much in demand in other states as well and his joining the alliance partners will bolster their campaign.Minutes after the SC order, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee said in a post on X said it will be “very helpful” in the context of the Lok Sabha polls.

"TMC workers ‘instilling fear in minds of Sandeshkhali women, alleges NCW; spat reaches EC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trinamool-ncw-spat-over-sandeshkhali-reaches-election-commission/articleshow/110020001.cms,"KOLKATA: The Sandeshkhali videos and retraction of rape allegations by two of three “survivors” triggered a fresh row Friday involving Trinamool Congress and National Commission for Women ( NCW ), culminating in the latter writing to Election Commission about West Bengal’s governing party “compelling women to withdraw cases”.The missive to EC came hours after TMC threatened to move the poll panel against NCW chairperson Rekha Sharma for allegedly “forcing and deceiving women from Sandeshkhali into filing fake rape complaints to malign Bengal”.At a TMC presser on Friday, the party demanded a police probe and criminal proceedings against the NCW chief for “misusing her chair” and being “one of the main conspirators” in the Sandeshkhali unrest.Four videos have emerged in the last few days, each suggesting that the rape allegations — or at least some of them — might have been concocted . A video from a purported sting in which BJP’s Sandeshkhali Block-II chief Gangadhar Koyal says the “Sandeshkhali movement” was MLA Suvendu Adhikari's brainchild is among them.There are two other videos, each showing a different “survivor” alleging she had been made to sign a blank sheet of paper, and an older clip featuring BJP's Basirhat candidate Rekha Patra telling a TV channel she suspected some of the “survivors” taken to Delhi to meet President Droupadi Murmu may have been “paid to impersonate”.TMC minister Shashi Panja said, “We will approach EC against the NCW chairperson, who coerced these women to file fake rape complaints. The BJP ecosystem started false stories for political agenda and then brought in various commissions. It is becoming clear now that these commissions were part of the conspiracy .”Sharma refuted the claims. In its letter to the poll panel, NCW alleged that TMC workers were “instilling fear in the minds of Sandeshkhali women and stopping them from coming forward with their complaints and potentially impacting the election process in the area”.The letter urges the EC to investigate the matter “on priority and direct the authorities to take appropriate measures”.“In recent developments surrounding the Sandeshkhali case, NCW has noted that a few women have suddenly taken their complaints back regarding Sheikh Shahjahan. NCW finds this turn of statement deeply concerning, particularly amid the backdrop of the general elections of 2024,” NCW said in a statement.","Four videos have emerged in the last few days, each suggesting that the rape allegations — or at least some of them — might have been concocted.
