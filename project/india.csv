BJP Hits Out at Tejashwi Yadav, Calls Rahul Gandhi PM Dreams Unrealist

(They forget that Lalu Ji’s blood runs in my veins. If he never bowed, do they think his son will be afraid? We are fighters.

Brothers, unite or they will finish your existence.)

NEW DELHI: Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav on Thursday said, “Ye log bhool gaye Lalu Ji ka khoon hai mere andar,” as he accused the BJP-led central government of undermining the Constitution and urged people to unite to safeguard their rights.He was speaking at the Samvidhaan Suraksha Samelan in Motihari as part of the ongoing Voter Adhikar Yatra.In a post on X in Hindi, Yadav referred to his father and RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav .

Otherwise, they will end your existence.”The former deputy chief minister warned that the government’s actions could gradually strip citizens of their rights. “First, they will snatch your vote, then your ration, then your pension, and finally your assets. Democracy will be replaced by dictatorship,” he said.Yadav also reiterated his party’s promise to increase reservation benefits, saying he would raise the quota to 85 per cent.Taking a swipe at Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, he remarked, “Chacha has been stuck... He is not the same as he was earlier...

NEW DELHI: The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh put a final full stop to the speculation over Prime Minister Narendra Modi's retirement as he is going to hit the age of 75 after his birthday this September. RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat , while speaking at the event “100 Years Journey of Sangh – New Horizon” on Thursday, clarified ongoing speculation around retirement norms. He dismissed reports suggesting that he or anyone in the Sangh must step down upon reaching the age of 75.""No bar on a family person becoming RSS chief, but the person needs to devote all his time to the organisation. I never said I will retire or someone else should retire at 75 years,"" RSS chief Bhagwat said.Over the past few years, the opposition has consistently criticised the BJP for its apparent policy of not fielding candidates older than 75.This stance was allegedly based on comments made by Shah prior to the 2019 Lok Sabha election, where he stated that it was his party's decision not to give Lok Sabha poll tickets to those above 75 years of age, leading to veteran leaders like L K Advani and Murali Manohar Joshi missing out.Shah said, ""Only the media is pushing this issue. No one above 75 has been given tickets. This is the party's decision."" He made these remarks in an interview to 'The Week'.However, Shah later clarified that this was an electoral decision, emphasising, ""There is no provision regarding age, anywhere in the Constitution of the BJP.""Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal also voiced his concerns, stating, ""He ( PM Modi) will retire next year. He is seeking votes to making Amit Shah the Prime Minister,"" during his election campaign. Additionally, Shah asserted that the BJP does not mandate leaders over the age of 75 to retire.",Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh put a final full stop to the speculation over Prime Minister Narendra Modi's retirement.
