​'Zero check kar lijiye': BJP's Anurag Thakur mocks Rahul Gandhi over Congress' electoral failure in Delhi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/zero-check-kar-lijiye-bjps-anurag-thakur-mocks-rahul-gandhi-over-congress-electoral-failure-in-delhi/articleshow/118122558.cms,"(Rahul ji, please check the zero.)

(""Rahul ji, please check the zero. This is not about Congress' seats)

NEW DELHI: BJP MP Anurag Thakur on Monday took aim at Congress’ latest election disaster in Delhi. Thakur called out LoP in Lok Sabha and former Congress president Rahul Gandhi saying, ""Rahul ji, zero check karlijiye,Speaking in the Lok Sabha during a debate on the Union Budget, Thakur held up a sign that read, ""12,00,000 income par 0 tax,"" referencing the tax relief for the middle class announced in the budget. He then turned his focus to Congress’ electoral record in Delhi.""Rahul ji, zero check kar lijiye. Ye Congress ki seaton ki baat nahi hai,"" Thakur remarked amid protests from NCP (SCP) MP Supriya Sule.He then listed the years 2014, 2015, 2019, 2020, 2024, and 2025, questioning how many seats Congress had secured in Delhi in each of those years. His question was met with a resounding ""zero"" from BJP MPs.Thakur declared that under Rahul Gandhi’s leadership, Congress had set a record for consistent electoral failure. His remarks came after BJP’s landslide victory in the Delhi Assembly elections, where the party secured 48 out of 70 seats, ending AAP’s decade-long rule. AAP was reduced to just 22 seats. Congress failed to win a single seat, marking its third consecutive zero tally in Delhi polls.The former Union minister IT minister also targeted Congress leaders for not participating in the ongoing Maha Kumbh, suggesting that they might have been advised against it by ""Uncle Soros and Uncle Sam."" He recalled how even former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru had taken a dip in the sacred waters but claimed today’s Congress leadership was avoiding it.""We all know that Maha Kumbh has been going on, I also got an opportunity to take a dip. I cannot explain the supernatural joy I experienced. Even Nehru had taken a dip in the Kumbh but today's generation is not ready to go.""""If they had gone, they also would have got an opportunity... maybe Uncle Soros and Sam would have issued a fatwa that no one will go to Ram Temple or take a holy dip in Kumbh,"" he said.On Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had hailed BJP's victory in Delhi, calling it historic and saying that the people had ""freed"" the city from ""AAP-da"" (a play on words referring to AAP as a disaster). Addressing BJP workers, Modi declared that the mandate signified the rejection of ""shortcuts and lies"" in politics and promised rapid development for the capital.","BJP MP Anurag Thakur took aim at Congress’ latest election disaster in Delhi.

"After drubbing AAP in Delhi, 'Bangal cholo' next for BJP?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-drubbing-aap-in-delhi-bangla-chalo-next-for-bjp/articleshow/118116026.cms,"PTI photo (File)

NEW DELHI: Since 2014, the BJP has been moving from one poll victory to another -- both on the national as well as the state level -- with seemingly nothing able to stand in the way of the Modi wave.However, one thorn in BJP's side was Delhi, where the Arvind Kejriwal-led fortress managed to survive the saffron tsunami not once, but twice.However, 2025 proved to be a breakthrough year as the BJP broke the 27-year-old jinx to storm back to power in the Capital. It defeated the indomitable Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) by winning 48 seats in the 70-member Delhi assembly.Bristling with confidence after acquiring the Rajdhani in the North, the party has already given clear indications that its next mission is to make inroads in the eastern state of West Bengal.Like Delhi, making inroads in the Mamata Banerjee-ruled Bengal has been an uphill task for the BJP for the past two assembly elections.In the 2016 assembly elections, buoyed by the majority mandate at the Centre, the BJP expected to emerge as a key party but faced an embarrassing defeat. The party won only 3 seats in the 294-seat West Bengal assembly.In 2019, the BJP came back to power at the Centre with an even bigger mandate and by then had a decent presence in even the northeastern states, where BJP had negligible presence before 2014.Two years down the line, the party made another attempt to breach the fortress of Mamata Banerjee but to no avail.In 2021, when the results trickled in, the BJP won only 77 seats with TMC winning a whopping mandate by securing victory on 215 seats. Though the BJP vote and seat share improved substantially, it was far less than the 200-seat mark the party had expected to win in the polls.Just like Delhi in 2015 and 2020, the BJP fell flat in Bengal in 2016 and 2021.However, with the BJP finally triumphing in Delhi, Bengal BJP leaders now see the possibility that Bengal may not be ""mission impossible"" anymore.As BJP was celebrating its victory in the Capital on February 8, its top Bengal leader Suvendu Adhikari shot off a salvo at CM Mamata Banerjee, saying after the national capital, Bengal would vote for the BJP by uprooting ruling TMC.""Delhi ki jeet hamari hai ... 2026 mein Bengal ki baari hai … (Delhi's victory is ours ... in 2026 it will be Bengal's turn),"" Adhikari said while reacting to BJP's massive comeback after 27 years of political exile.Pumped by the BJP's historic win in Delhi, Bengal BJP chief and Union minister Sukanta Majumdar said Delhi's victory would serve as a morale booster for party workers in West Bengal ahead of next year's assembly elections.BJP's Amit Malviya, who heads the party's I-T department, said that ""jitters from the Delhi results are being felt in West Bengal"" and claimed that ""nervous"" Mamata Banerjee would go solo in next year's assembly polls.""A nervous Mamata Banerjee has told TMC MLAs that there will be NO alliance in Bengal … It is not surprising that she applies a different yardstick to the opposition in Haryana and Delhi but is unwilling to cede space for the alliance at home,"" Malviya wrote on X.",The BJP broke 27-year-old jinx to storm back to power in the Capital. It defeated the indomitable Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in the 70-member Delhi assembly.

NEW DELHI: Haryana BJP on Monday issued a show cause notice to minister Anil Vij who has been vocal against his own party for quite some time.In the notice, the party asked Vij to reply within three days over his recent public statements against the Haryana BJP chief and chief minister position held by Nayab Singh Saini.A few days ago, Vij alleged that CM Saini's close aide colluded against him by backing the rival candidate during last year's Haryana assembly election.The minister claimed that one Ashish Tayal backed Chitra Sarwara in the Ambala Canntt constituency during the state polls in which Vij won with a margin of 7,277 votes. Sarwara contested the assembly elections as an Independent after she was denied a ticket by the Congress.Vij also posted a video compilation of pictures in which people with Tayal were seen campaigning for Sarwara during the assembly elections. The compilation also had a photo of Tayal with CM Saini.The minister has been targeting the party's state government while alleging that his orders were being ignored. His unhappiness is said to have started after a meeting of the Haryana cabinet in which he had raised this issue.""Ashish Tayal, who calls himself a friend of Nayab Saini, has many pictures with Nayab Saini on Facebook. The same workers who are seen with Ashish Tayal during the assembly elections are also seen with the BJP's opposing candidate Chitra Sarwara. What is the relationship? Tayal is still Nayab Saini's best friend, so the question arises who made him oppose the BJP candidate?,"" Vij wrote this on X in Hindi.The remark by Vij came two days after the BJP relieved Tayal of his official posts in the Ambala unit. However, the move did not pacify the minister.Anil Vij not only pointed a finger at the Haryana CM but also the state BJP chief Mohan Lal Badoli , who he said should step down given the allegations of gang rape case him. The case was registered against Badoli in December last year in Himachal.""I wonder how a person who is facing the charge of gang rape can attend or chair a meeting of the party being attended by women. Ours is a sacred party, and we maintain its sanctity. Hence, he should have resigned. He is not a bigger leader than Sh L K Advani ji, who resigned after his name was involved in a meagre controversy. Hence, he too should resign until he gets a clean chit from the police,"" Vij had said.",Haryana BJP issues a show cause notice to minister Anil Vij.

They have to decide whether they will do coalition politics or go it alone. Also, it has become necessary to make fundamental changes in the party's organisation,"" Anwar said in a post on X.Party leader Rashid Alvi echoed similar sentiments and said that the grand-old party needs to ""respect all parties in the INDIA bloc"" if they aim to defeat the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).He warned that the results were a cause of concern for the Muslim community in Delhi, adding, “This election has forced them to think that the BJP has won because of us. If we want to defeat the BJP, we must respect all parties in the INDIA alliance and strengthen the coalition.”""If Congress and Aam Aadmi Party had fought Delhi elections together, then BJP could not have won.

What has happened in Delhi is a matter of worry for the Muslims in Delhi,"" he said.""This election in Delhi has forced them to think that BJP has won the election because of us (Congress).

This victory brought the BJP back to power in Delhi after 27 years, with the party winning 48 out of 70 seats.AAP managed to win only 22, with several of its top leaders, including former chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and former deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, suffering defeats. Kejriwal lost the New Delhi seat to BJP’s Parvesh Verma by a margin of 4,089 votes, while Congress’s candidate Sandeep Dikshit performed poorly, securing just 4,568 votes.Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed the victory as “historic,” saying, “The people of Delhi have driven out ‘AAP-da’.

Ostentation, anarchy, arrogance, and the ‘AAP-da’ that had engulfed Delhi have been defeated.”Kejriwal, in a video message, accepted the mandate and congratulated the BJP. “We accept the people’s verdict with humility.

Offence is best defence: Politics of confrontation

NEW DELHI: Arvind Kejriwal 's dream run in Delhi has come to an end. After two sweeping victories - in 2015 and 2020 - Kejriwal's AAP has been swept out of power in the 2025 assembly elections. The BJP has finally managed to breach Kejriwal's Delhi fortress to regain power after a gap of 27 years. The former Delhi chief minister, who was out on bail in the excise policy case, ran a very aggressive campaign against the BJP and also targeted the Congress.So, why did Kejriwal lose? Here's a look at some of the tricks that failed to click for the AAP chief.Arvind Kejriwal, who was out on bail in the excise policy case, resigned as chief minister of Delhi in September 2024, months ahead of elections to take a high moral ground on the issue of corruption.""I am ready for Agni Pariksha. Two days later, I will resign as chief minister. I will not sit on that chair till the people announce their verdict,"" Kejriwal had said at the time of resignation.Kejriwal, who had refused to resign even when he was in jail, eventually gave up his chair amid turmoil faced by him in the Delhi excise policy case. Several top leaders, including Kejriwal himself, faced accusations of accepting bribes from liquor companies in exchange for favorable policies. Eventually, several AAP leaders were jailed in connection with the case.Kejriwal's claim to fame in his first two terms was his transparent and pro-people governance model. The AAP chief claimed credit for transforming Delhi's government schools and his Mohalla clinics provided cheap medicare to the poor. In the 2020 elections, Kejriwal sought votes for his work and AAP campaign centred around the change it had brought to the lives of the people. However, this time around AAP's campaign was centred around its attacks on the BJP leadership and the Congress. Kejriwal, who along with top AAP leadership faced several corruption charges, focused less on development and governance narratives. He called BJP ""Gali Galauj Party.""In the middle of the campaign, Kejriwal dropped a bombshell as he accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna waters to kill people of Delhi. Kejriwal's charges gave a toxic turn to Delhi campaign with both BJP and Congress going all out against the AAP chief. At the end, as the results show - the people of Delhi were not swayed by his ""concerns"" for them.Arvind Kejriwal tried to woo the middle class by unveiling his party’s manifesto for them. He claimed that the middle class were ignored by successive governments and accused other political parties of treating them as ""just an ATM for the government"". Ironically though, Kejriwal's manifesto did not mention what he would do for the middle class if voted to power but only listed seven demands from the Centre to improve their lives. Little wonder, at the end the Centre's sops for the middle class in the Uunion Budget appealed more to Delhi voters than the AAP's demands.Confrontation has been a part of Kejriwal's politics right from the beginning. This time around it was no different. Right through his campaign, Kejriwal trained his guns at Delhi Police and the Election Commission. Kejriwal accused the Election Commission and Delhi Police of colluding with the BJP to subvert the electoral process and prevent AAP from campaigning. Kejriwal targeted Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar and alleged that he ""wants a job post-retirement"" and was ""destroying the country"" for the post. Kejriwal's decision to take on the Congress along with the BJP boomeranged as on several seats, AAP's margin of defeat is less than the votes polled by the Congress candidate. Both Kejriwal and Rahul made relentless attacks against each other giving an opportunity to mock the allies-turned-rivals and take digs at opposition unity.",Arvind Kejriwal's dream run in Delhi has come to an end.

Congress is the only option for AAP MLAs as BJP has no future in state,"" he said.AAP senior spokesperson Neel Garg, however, accused Sirsa of ""rumour mongering"" to please BJP leadership as he was in race for Delhi CM's post.

""Those tainted can be segregated and the recruitment of the rest should be validated by the SC,"" he said.He was supported by senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi who appeared for the state govt.

NEW DELHI: Former Union minister and BJP leader Anurag Thakur on Sunday alleged that outgoing Delhi chief minister Atishi danced after learning that Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) convener Arvind Kejriwal’s ""ploy to engineer her defeat had failed.""Thakur was commenting on a leaked video purportedly showing Atishi celebrating her victory from the Kalkaji Assembly constituency. He claimed the defeat of top AAP leaders, including Kejriwal and former deputy CM Manish Sisodia, exposed internal rifts within the party.Thakur accused Kejriwal of sidelining party leaders for personal gain. ""He entered politics using Anna Hazare’s movement, then abandoned him, and later removed his own party’s founding members. Now, he has faced the same betrayal,"" he said.He alleged that Kejriwal’s team worked against senior AAP leaders, including Atishi. “Her name was missing from banners and campaign material, yet she won. That’s why you saw her dance in the leaked video,” he said.Thakur also claimed that Delhi voters celebrated Kejriwal’s defeat. “They tried to pin the liquor scam on Sisodia, but we always maintained that Kejriwal was the kingpin. The court has punished him, and he is currently out on bail,” he said.Calling AAP a ""disaster"" for Delhi, Thakur said the party had broken records in corruption. ""Fifteen MLAs in jail, eight ministers in jail, one MP in jail, the CM and deputy CM in jail—AAP had no honest face left to ask for votes,"" he said.He credited BJP’s victory in Delhi to PM Narendra Modi’s leadership. ""People have rejected Kejriwal’s false guarantees.
