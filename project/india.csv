Calcutta high court sets aside Ganguly order in Suvendu kin case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/calcutta-high-court-sets-aside-ganguly-order-in-suvendu-kin-case/articleshow/109704292.cms,"KOLKATA: Calcutta high court on Monday set aside an order by former judge Abhijit Ganguly that fined Egra sub-divisional police officer Rs 5 lakh for allegedly “harassing” Krishnendu Adhikari , the elder brother of BJP’s Suvendu Adhikari, Bengal’s leader of opposition.Ganguly joined BJP in March. He is the party candidate in Tamluk, one of the LS constituencies in East Midnapore, the Adhikaris’ home district.A division bench of Chief Justice TS Sivagnanam and Justice Hiranmay Bhattacharyya held that Ganguly’s order was passed without giving the state “appropriate opportunity” to present its case.The bench observed that such a situation was “uncalled for”.The bench directed the registry to list Krishnendu’s petition in an appropriate court to be heard “afresh” in June and stayed a notice sent to him by cops.Egra cops had sent the notice asking Krishnendu to attend a questioning session as a “witness” in a case over poor lighting on the Mecheda-Digha Bypass in East Midnapore. Krishnendu moved the former HC judge’s court in Nov 2023, praying for quashing the notice as the cops went beyond their remit and asked him to attend the session with 10 years’ income-tax returns.Ganguly admitted Krishnendu’s petition and passed an order the same day imposing Rs 5 lakh as cost on the Egra SDPO for “harassment”. “This is nothing but harassment. The police force was not created to harass a citizen,” the former judge had observed.On Monday, state advocate-general Kishore Datta moved an appeal. “No submission was made by the lawyer. Nothing was recorded in the order. The order was passed the day the petition reached the court,” Datta contended.Datta, pointing to the “chequered history” of the case, also referred to orders of a number of single-judge benches of HC. The CJ-led division bench did not go into the merits of the case but set aside the order saying the state was not heard. “Contesting respondents should have the opportunity to file affidavits. Let them file the affidavits,” CJ Sivagnanam observed.","Former judge Abhijit Ganguly fined Egra sub-divisional police officer Rs 5 lakh for allegedly “harassing’ Krishnendu Adhikari.

NEW DELHI: Coming to the aid of a transgender person who wants to contest Lok Sabha elections but allegedly faces threats, Delhi High Court has ordered police to provide necessary security for the person to file the nomination.The court stressed that it was the duty of the state to safeguard and enforce rights guaranteed to transgenders under the Constitution, while hearing plea of Rajan Singh, who wants to contest from South Delhi with the support of Rashtriya Bahujan Congress Party.Singh moved court claiming there was a ''life threatening attack'' earlier this month at his office in Badarpur and sought directions for appropriate security.''Article 14 of the Constitution of India ensures equal protection... in all spheres of state activity, including participation in the election process.

"In Sambhal, with a large Muslim presence, Kalki skews arithmetic",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/lok-sabha-elections/lok-sabha-election-news/in-sambhal-with-a-large-muslim-presence-kalki-skews-arithmetic/articleshow/109743011.cms,"Sambhal , a tranquil town in Moradabad about 180km from Delhi, shot into the limelight on Feb 19 when PM Modi laid the foundation stone of a Kalki temple here.Kalki is believed to be a yet-to-beborn avatar of Vishnu who will complete the deity’s dashavatar (10 incarnations), and Sambhal is believed to be where Kalki will appear. Thus, a temple dedicated to the deity, constructed by expelled Congress functionary Acharya Pramod Krishnam, who has now aligned with BJP , is generating significant interest in religious and political circles.Sambhal has traditionally been a Samajwadi Party (SP) bastion — its veteran, Shafiq Ur-Rehman Barq (who died at 93 a few months ago), had won the seat more than once. SP has now fielded his grandson, Zia Ur-Rehman Barq, the incumbent Kundarki MLA, from this constituency.With a large Muslim population — comprising almost 35% of the electorate — the seat had been a difficult place for BJP in 2019, as it lost all six seats in the Moradabad division, which encompasses Sambhal. But now, with the Kalki card up its sleeve, the party is hoping for a favourable turn of events.Krishnam, the peethadheeshwar (temple head) of Shri Kalki Dham, told TOI, “After Kashi, Ayodhya and Mathura, Kalki Peeth will be developed into a major religious centre, particularly after the PM himself laid its foundation. The move will impact the political landscape of western UP. Until now, the Hindu vote was divided into various splinter groups affiliated with regional parties. Now, it will bring all of them together.”Interestingly, Krishnam, who contested the 2014 polls from Sambhal on a Congress ticket and lost, is hoping to retain the liberal Muslims who attended various events at Kalki Dham in the past. “During the foundation ceremony, half of the attendees were not part of the BJP fold, and that included some Muslims too,” he said. “Barq had thrown a spanner into the temple proposal in 2016, but in Aug 2023, Allahabad high court gave a decision in our favour,” he claimed.Parmeshwar Lal Saini is BJP’s choice for the seat. He had lost to Barq Sr five years ago. Sambhal has always been an opposition stronghold, except for 2014, when BJP’s Satyapal Singh Saini emerged victorious, securing 34% of the votes to win a tight triangular contest against SP and BSP. In 2019, the SP-BSP alliance defeated Parmeshwar, with the latter still managing 41% of votes.Saini told TOI, “This time, we are confident that the lotus will bloom in Sambhal. The Kalki temple foundation by the PM will seal our victory. I have the support of voters, irrespective of gender, caste, or faith.”Saulat Ali, a former MLA who won from Moradabad in 1996, has since contested six elections without success. Recently, he parted ways with Congress to join BSP, and is contesting from Sambhal. Ali said, “I played a pivotal role in Zia Ur-Rehman Barq’s victory as Kundarki MLA as an SP candidate in 2022. As far as I see, SP has no significant presence in Samb hal, and the contest is two-pronged between BJP and BSP.”Ali holds considerable influence in the region considering his political experience. His father, Riyasat Hussain, was also a four-time MLA. His ability to sway supporters of Iqbal Mehmood, Barq’s rival, could impact the election outcome, especially considering Barq’s strained relations with Qureshi voters.Political experts agree on a possible Kalki effect. “BJP has skilfully used religion to blunt the impact of caste politics in the area. The Kalki event will consolidate Hindu votes for the party irrespective of the caste of the candidate they put up,” said Sanjeev Kumar Sharma, head of political science department at Chaudhary Charan Singh University, Meerut.Amroha-based analyst Shoib Chaudhary said, “Voters in Sambhal and surrounding districts have primarily been anti-BJP due to the large Muslim presence. These areas have remained SP strongholds for the last three decades, barring a few incidental wins for BJP on the back of an unconsolidated opposition. BJP had been eyeing these regions for long, and the development of a temple in Kalki Dham can work wonders for them.”","Kalki is believed to be a yet-to-beborn avatar of Vishnu who will complete the deity’s dashavatar (10 incarnations) A temple dedicated to the deity, constructed by expelled Congress functionary Acharya Pramod Krishnam, is generating significant interest in religious and political circles.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109743009,imgsize-42794,width-400,resizemode-4/109743009.jpg"
Rival lineups ready: 3 of Mumbai's 6 seats to get 1st-time LS MPs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/rival-lineups-ready-3-of-mumbais-6-seats-to-get-1st-time-ls-mps/articleshow/109743999.cms,"Cong fields Bhushan Patil against Goyal in Mum North

MUMBAI: With three days left for the deadline for filing nominations, major parties filled in the blanks in the six Lok Sabha constituencies in the city on Tuesday. Shiv Sena declared its nominees from Mumbai South and Mumbai North West, MLAs Yamini Jadhav and Ravindra Waikar, respectively, and Congress named its city unit vice-president Bhushan Patil from Mumbai North.Three of the seats will have first-timers contesting for both rival fronts: Mumbai North, where Patil will face Rajya Sabha MP Piyush Goyal of BJP; North West, where Waikar will take on Amol Kirtikar of Sena (UBT); and North Central, where lawyer Ujjwal Nikam will be pitted against Congress MLA Varsha Gaikwad.There will be only two sitting MPs in the general election in the city, Arvind Sawant of Sena (UBT) from South and Rahul Shewale (Shiv Sena) from South Central. There is one former LS member, Sanjay Dina Patil of Sena (UBT), and two sitting Rajya Sabha members, Goyal and Anil Desai of Sena (UBT), in the election.Congress on Tuesday nominated city party vice-president Bhushal Patil for the Mumbai North Lok Sabha constituency.Patil (55), who had unsuccessfully contested the 2009 assembly polls from Borivli against BJP's Gopal Shetty, will take on Union minister Piyush Goyal, the BJP candidate . ""I am contesting the election with full might. Since I have the support of all MVA constituents, securing a victory does not appear to be difficult; I am sure to win,"" said Patil, who has been associated with Mumbai Congress for over two decades. With Patil's nomination, Congress has announced nominees for all 17 seats allotted to it as per the MVA seat-sharing formula. Shiv Sena (UBT) too has declared all its 21 Lok Sabha poll candidates and NCP (SP) its 10 candidates.For Congress, it was a piquant situation since most senior leaders were shy of contesting against Goyal. Then Congress had proposed that Sena (UBT)'s Vinod Ghosalkar contest from Mumbai North and in lieu of that seat, either Sangli or Mumbai South-Central be given to it. Sena (UBT) rejected the proposal. It had also been proposed that either actor Raj Babbar or Sonu Sood be the Congress nominee for Mumbai North. Babbar has been nominated from Gurgaon, while there was no response from Sood. Congress was also keen that city party chief Varsha Gaikwad contests from Mumbai South-Central; but she has been fielded from Mumbai North-Central against special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam.","Congress names city unit vice-president Bhushan Patil from Mumbai North.
