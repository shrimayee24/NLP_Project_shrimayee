Delhi To Get BJP Woman Chief Minister Afters Decades? Meet BJP's CM Probables | Watch

Amid growing discussions about the BJP’s government formation in Delhi, the party is exploring the option of appointing two deputy chief ministers. Party insiders say this move is aimed at showcasing Delhi as a ""mini India"" by representing its diverse communities.""It is highly likely because this has been done in various other states where deputy CMs have been appointed to accommodate leaders of different backgrounds. This has been done in party-ruled MP, UP and Rajasthan,"" a party leader told news agency PTI.The final decision will be taken by the national leadership once Prime Minister Narendra Modi returns from his foreign visit this weekend. A meeting of the BJP legislative party is expected on Sunday to elect the leader of the House, who will become Delhi’s next chief minister, the leaders said.Several names are reportedly being considered for the top post, including Parvesh Verma, who defeated AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal in the New Delhi seat, former Delhi BJP chiefs Vijender Gupta and Satish Upadhyay, and senior leaders like Manjinder Singh Sirsa, Pawan Sharma, Rekha Gupta, Ashish Sood, and Shikha Rai. Newly elected MLAs Karnail Singh and Raj Kumar Bhatia are also in the race.","Party insiders say this move is aimed at showcasing Delhi as a ""mini India"" by representing its diverse communities.

All's not well in MVA? Sharad Pawar's praise for Eknath Shinde draws ire from Uddhav Thackeray's party,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/alls-not-well-in-mva-sharad-pawars-praise-for-eknath-shinde-draws-ire-from-uddhav-thackerays-party/articleshow/118175845.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) seems to be facing internal tensions after the recent loss in Maharashtra. Nationalist Congress Party (SP) chief Sharad Pawar 's felicitation of Maharashtra deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde at an event in Delhi has invoked strong criticism by ally Uddhav Thackeray 's Sena.Sharad Pawar's move has not gone down well with the Shiv Sena (UBT), with senior party leader Sanjay Raut strongly criticising Pawar for honouring the man who, with the backing of the BJP and Union home minister Amit Shah, ""orchestrated the split in the Shiv Sena in 2022.""Shinde was conferred the Mahadji Shinde Rashtra Gaurav Puraskar at the 98th Akhil Bhartiya Marathi Sahitya Sammelan, with Pawar himself presenting the award.Speaking at the evening, Pawar praised Eknath Shinde for his ""significant contribution"" to Thane, Navi Mumbai, and Mumbai.""Thane, Navi Mumbai, and Mumbai require strong and consistent leadership to navigate their political landscape effectively. Leaders like former municipal presidents Savlaram Patil and Rangnekar played key roles, and Eknath Shinde has significantly contributed as well,"" Pawar said.Also read: Sharad Pawar offers rare applause for Eknath Shinde for bridging political divides While Pawar’s party downplayed the event, calling it a literary and cultural function rather than a political one, the BJP saw it as an indirect admission by Pawar that Shinde was a better chief minister than Uddhav Thackeray.Raut, however, saw it as an insult to the alliance. “Certain things should be avoided in politics. Yesterday, Sharad Pawar did not felicitate Shinde, but he felicitated Amit Shah. This is our feeling,” Raut told reporters in Delhi. “You are a senior politician, and we respect you. But those who split Balasaheb Thackeray’s Shiv Sena with the help of Amit Shah and weakened Maharashtra, you are honouring such people. This has hurt the sentiments of Marathi people.”The BJP was quick to exploit the discord. Maharashtra BJP chief Chandrashekhar Bawankule claimed that Pawar’s gesture was an acknowledgment that Shinde was a superior chief minister to Thackeray. “Pawar has admitted that Shinde was a better CM,” he said, adding that Pawar himself had written in his autobiography that Thackeray visited the state secretariat, Mantralaya, only twice during his tenure. At the same time, Shinde worked tirelessly for 22 hours a day.NCP (SP) MP Amol Kolhe dismissed Raut’s criticism, calling it a personal opinion and stressing that the event was a cultural gathering, not a political one. “He showed statesmanship, where one does not bring politics into everything,” said Kolhe.Shinde, in his acceptance speech, showered praise on Pawar, talking about the importance of maintaining good relations across political lines. “Pawar also bowls googly deliveries that are tough to decipher. I have good relations with Pawar, but he has not bowled me a googly. I am confident that he will not bowl me a googly in the future as well,” he said, using a cricket analogy to highlight his camaraderie with the veteran leader.Shinde also focused on Maharashtra’s progress under his leadership, crediting Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah for standing firmly behind the state. He remarked that Pawar had witnessed firsthand the developmental work undertaken in the past two and a half years. “He (Pawar) calls me often. One has to learn from Pawar how to maintain relations going beyond political lines,” Shinde said.The episode comes at a time when both the MVA and the INDIA bloc are grappling with internal fissures, worsened by the outcome of last November’s elections in Maharashtra, Haryana and the recent elections in Delhi. The MVA suffered heavy losses due to internal “friendly fights,” which saw its partners contesting against each other in 21 seats. This division proved costly, as the MVA lost 17 of those contests.","Nationalist Congress Party (SP) chief Sharad Pawar's felicitation of Maharashtra deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde at an event in Delhi has invoked strong criticism by ally Uddhav Thackeray's Sena.

Punjab AAP

NEW DELHI: Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann on Tuesday dismissed claims by Congress and BJP of unrest brewing among AAP MLAs, tamping down speculation that the ripples from AAP's Delhi debacle may pose a risk to his govt.Talking to reporters after the surprise move of party boss Arvind Kejriwal to summon Punjab CM, ministers, MPs and MLAs to Delhi, Mann took on Congress and said ""switching sides is Congress's culture"" and reminded Partap Singh Bajwa, the leader of opposition in Punjab, that his party drew a blank in Delhi.Ahead of the meeting, which AAP said was attended by all 92 Punjab MLAs, Bajwa had alleged that the party was preparing the ground to oust Mann from the CM's post. He had also claimed that over 30 AAP MLAs were in touch with his party.Instead of counting our MLAs, he should see how many Congress candidates won in Delhi,"" Bhagwant Mann said. Kejriwal and other senior functionaries held a meeting with Punjab functionaries to ostensibly thank them for their involvement in Delhi campaign.According to AAP, the meeting at Kapurthala House saw all MLAs from Punjab and MPs from the state come together in what the party projected as a show of solidarity and normalcy amid the gloom of the Delhi loss. Besides Kejriwal and former deputy CM Manish Sisodia, national organisational secretary and Rajya Sabha MP Sandeep Pathak and RS MP Raghav Chadha were present.Kejriwal is learnt to have asked the Punjab MLAs to reconnect with voters while working unitedly to pave the way for AAP's return to office in 2027. The timing of the meeting following AAP's defeat in Delhi had sparked speculation about instability in the party's Punjab unit. Asked about Bajwa's allegation that he could quit AAP with a group of MLAs, Mann said, ""Let them say so. We cultivated the party with hard work by going to every nook and corner of the state. They don't worry about their own party and find fault with others. It is Congress that has a culture of switching parties.""BJP's newly-elected Rajouri Garden MLA Manjinder Singh Sirsa claimed Mann's ""nervousness and body language"" after the meeting ""supports the conspiracy theory"" that he had spoken of on Monday. Sirsa had alleged that Kejriwal was scripting a narrative to oust Mann.AAP's estranged RS MP Swati Maliwal also took a dig at Kejriwal and said, ""Some people have started treating Punjab as their personal ATM. Today, massive corruption is rampant in Punjab.""","Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann dismissed claims by Congress and BJP of unrest among AAP MLAs.
