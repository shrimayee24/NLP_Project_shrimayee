Attempt to prevent me from speaking on issues of national security: Rahul

NEW DELHI: Eight opposition MPs of the Congress and the CPI-M were suspended from the Lok Sabha for the rest of the Budget Session on Tuesday for “unruly behaviour”. MPs mounted the table and hurled papers at the Chair after Rahul Gandhi was disallowed for the second day from speaking on former Army chief General Naravane’s purported revelations on Chinese aggression in his unpublished book.In a protest letter to Speaker Om Birla, Rahul said it was the first time the LOP was not allowed to speak on the President’s joint address, and it is a blot on democracy.The suspensions and bedlam have put a question mark on proceedings for Wednesday, when PM Narendra Modi is scheduled to reply to the motion of thanks on the President’s address. Govt sources said the PM’s reply will go on as planned.The suspended members are Congress’ Manickam Tagore, Gurjeet Aujla, Amarinder Raja Warring, Hibi Eden, Prashant Padole, C Kiran Kumar Reddy, Dean Kuriakose, and CPI-M’s S Venkatesan.After the Tuesday morning session was adjourned owing to the opposition’s demand that the govt discuss the Indo-US trade deal, Rahul Gandhi picked up from Monday when his insistence on speaking on Naravane’s unpublished book elicited a red flag from the govt.Speaker Om Birla ruled that the LOP could not cite the book and should speak on motion of thanks.On Tuesday, Rahul said he was authenticating the press article he was referring to for Naravane’s book, as was asked by the Chair, but parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju said the Chair had ruled that he could not speak on the issue.As Rahul again started his speech with the contentious subject, Presiding Officer Krishna Prasad Tenneti overruled him and called the next speaker from SP Uttam Patel to speak, who refused.He moved to Shatabdi Roy of TMC who too did not speak. When BJP ally TDP’s Harish Balayogi started his speech, the angry opposition members trooped into the well. While they raised slogans, Prashant Padole climbed on the secretary general’s table, even as some members threw papers at the Chair, which forced the house to be adjourned. On resumption, Presiding Officer Dilip Saikia suspended the eight MPs. It led to bedlam and the house was adjourned for the day.In a protest letter to the Speaker, Rahul Gandhi said a member can refer to a document in his speech after authenticating it, and the refusal to let him speak suggests “there is a deliberate attempt to prevent me as LOP from speaking on matters of national security”.During the fracas, presiding officer Tenneti objected to Congress MP K C Venugopal’s use of “yaar” (pal) in his angry interventions to back Rahul Gandhi.",Eight opposition MPs of the Congress and the CPI-M were suspended from the Lok Sabha for “unruly behaviour” MPs mounted the table and hurled papers at the Chair after Rahul Gandhi was disallowed for the second day from speaking on General Naravane’s purported revelations on Chinese aggression.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127896613,width-400,resizemode-4/new-delhi-feb-03-ani-lok-sabha-lop-rahul-gandhi-congress-mp-priyanka-gandhi.jpg"

'Arrogant, Liar': Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee Attacks CEC Gyanesh After SIR Meet In Delhi

NEW DELHI: Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Kalyan Banerjee on Tuesday said the party is considering bringing a motion to impeach Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Gyanesh Kumar over the manner in which the poll body is conducting the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) in West Bengal and other states, some of which will hold elections either this year or in 2027.""We will bring impeachment motion against the CEC. The way they are conducting the SIR is wrong. This would affect the voting rights of all citizens of the country. They want to ensure nobody has voting rights. Therefore, we are considering impeachment motion over this ill-motive. We are also talking to other parties,"" Banerjee told reporters.The TMC is the third-largest opposition party—and the fourth-largest overall—in the Lok Sabha, with 28 members, all from West Bengal, which it governs. The party has been in power here since 2011.Banerjee's remarks came a day after West Bengal chief minister and TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee met CEC Kumar and two election commissioners at the EC office in Delhi to discuss the SIR issue. She reportedly slammed the table and stormed out of the room, bringing the meeting to an end.On Tuesday, Mamata Banerjee also called for the impeachment of the CEC, whom she described as ""arrogant"" following Monday's meeting.""We also want him (Gyanesh Kumar) to be impeached,"" she said at a press conference in Delhi. The West Bengal CM is in the national capital as part of her intensified campaign against the ongoing SIR in her state.She held a press conference in Delhi with “victims” of the SIR process from West Bengal. The Trinamool chief claimed they “represented many others who suffered due to the exercise.”“People sitting behind us are all SIR victims. I could have brought lakhs of people here. They are not giving an opportunity to SIR victims to defend themselves,” PTI quoted her as saying.Questioning the timing of the SIR, Mamata Banerjee asked why the exercise was being conducted just ahead of assembly elections. She also questioned why it was being carried out only in poll-bound states ruled by the opposition and not in the BJP-ruled Assam, where a special revision (SR) of electoral rolls is underway.“Out of the four election-bound states, they’re doing SIR in three states and not in BJP-ruled Assam,” she said, referring to West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala. The three states and Assam, along with the Union Territory of Puducherry, will go to polls around April–May.The Supreme Court is currently hearing multiple petitions against the West Bengal SIR, including those filed by TMC MPs."," Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Kalyan Banerjee said the party is considering bringing a motion to impeach Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Gyanesh Kumar.

Rishikesh resort murder: CBI registers case against ‘unknown VIP’; probe renewed after audio clips surface online,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/rishikesh-resort-murder-cbi-registers-case-against-unknown-vip/articleshow/127898818.cms,"



DEHRADUN: CBI on Monday registered a case against an ""unknown VIP"" in connection with the 2022 murder of a 19-year-old receptionist at a Rishikesh resort owned by a BJP leader's son. A CBI officer, requesting anonymity, confirmed the development to TOI and said a special team of the central agency reached Dehradun on Monday to initiate a probe after registering the case.""The team met officers of Uttarakhand police SIT, which had investigated the case and filed a chargesheet on the basis of which the accused were convicted. The team will examine case-related documents and probe to ascertain whether any VIP was involved,"" the officer said.Uttarakhand chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami had recommended a CBI inquiry into the alleged 'mysterious VIP' on Jan 9, following days of protests by social groups and political parties, as well as demands by the victim's parents, who sought an investigation by the probe agency under the supervision of a Supreme Court judge.CBI registered its case based on the FIR lodged at Dehradun's Vasant Vihar police station after Doon-based environmentalist and Padma Bhushan awardee Anil Joshi wrote to Uttarakhand DGP Deepam Seth.The FIR was registered against an unidentified person under BNS sections 238 (causing disappearance of evidence), 249 (harbouring an offender) and 45 (abetment of an offence).The case regained political traction after audio clips allegedly released by Haridwar-based actor Urmila Sanawar circulated online. In the clips, expelled former BJP MLA Suresh Rathore-whom Sanawar claimed was her husband-can purportedly be heard referring to a ""VIP"", whom he alleged was BJP national general secretary and Uttarakhand in-charge Dushyant Gautam. Gautam denied the allegations and filed defamation cases against the couple.An SIT was also constituted to probe the 'VIP' angle.The receptionist was murdered in Sept 2022 by resort owner Pulkit Arya and his associates, Ankit Gupta and Saurabh Bhaskar. All three are currently in jail, serving life sentences after they were convicted by a Kotdwar court last year.","CBI registered a case against an ""unknown VIP"" in connection with the 2022 murder of a 19-year-old receptionist at a Rishikesh resort.
