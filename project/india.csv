NEW DELHI: The sister of the Unnao rape survivor on Tuesday criticised the Delhi high court for granting bail to convict and former BJP leader Kuldeep Singh Sengar and suspending his life sentence in the case.The woman alleged that Sengar’s release would endanger her family’s lives.""I am not happy about this. He killed my uncle and then my father. Then this incident happened with my sister. He has been released, but we're still in danger. He killed my uncle and then my father. He (Sengar) has been released, but we're still in danger,"" she told news agency ANI.The woman added that while the court may have released Sengar, it should at least put her family behind bars for their “safety.”“My sister is in distress. If something happens to my family, will the court take responsibility? I have a brother—who knows what they might do to him? Many of his men are roaming around outside, threatening us. If we dare file a police complaint, they will kill us. That is why we do not leave our home out of fear,” she said.Earlier on Tuesday, a Delhi high court bench comprising Justices Subramonium Prasad and Harish Vaidyanathan Shankar granted conditional bail to Kuldeep Singh Sengar and suspended his sentence for the duration of the pendency of his appeal challenging his December 2019 conviction and life sentence by a trial court.The conditions of his bail include furnishing a Rs 15-lakh personal bond with three sureties of the same amount, not entering within a five-kilometre radius of the survivor’s residence, and refraining from threatening or influencing her or her mother.On August 1, 2019, over two years after the ghastly June 2017 crime, the Supreme Court had transferred the rape case and other related matters from Uttar Pradesh to Delhi.Sengar’s appeal against his conviction in the case relating to the custodial death of the survivor’s father is also pending before the high court. He was sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment in that case and has sought suspension of the sentence, citing the substantial time he has already spent in jail.",Sister of Unnao rape survivor criticises Delhi high court for granting bail to Kuldeep Singh Sengar.

NEW DELHI: Delhi lieutenant governor VK Saxena on Tuesday wrote to former chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, holding his government responsible for the capital's deteriorating air quality.In a 15-page letter, LG Saxena said, “11 years of neglect and criminal inaction on you and your Government’s part are responsible for the emergency air situation in the Capital”.However, Delhi is currently governed by BJP chief minister Rekha Gupta.Delhi LG’s letter to the former chief minister comes against the backdrop of the capital’s persistent and severe air pollution crisis.On Delhi LG VK Saxena's letter to Kejriwal, AAP national media incharge Anurag Dhandha said, ""Has the LG, who left Delhi amidst all the pollution to go to Gujarat for his own pleasure, returned? I think the pollution affecting people's lungs in Delhi has affected the LG's brain, and he's lost his memory. He doesn't remember that Arvind Kejriwal isn't the Chief Minister anymore, but Rekha Gupta is. If he wanted to ask something about the pollution, he should have asked her. .. LG sir is also a 'CameraG'. He's very fond of being on camera... But nobody pays him any attention these days... That's why he's roaming around in a frenzy...""During his tenure, AAP supremo Kejriwal grappled with similar hazardous air-quality levels and, much like the BJP’s poll manifesto, had pledged an aggressive push to curb pollution in the city.In February this year, the Aam Aadmi Party suffered a major setback, losing the elections to the BJP, paving the way for the saffron party to return to power in Delhi after 26 years.AAP is now reduced to governing only Punjab under chief minister Bhagwant Mann after its loss in Delhi.","Delhi lieutenant governor VK Saxena on Tuesday wrote to former chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.

'Maha Jungle Raj in Bengal, Mamata Shielding Infiltrators': PM Modi Blasts TMC in Virtual Rally

NEW DELHI: Even as Hindus are facing targeted attacks from Jamaat-e-Islami in Bangladesh, they are at the receiving end of ""targeted action"" of the Trinamool Congress govt in West Bengal, BJP alleged on Tuesday, slamming the state police for its use of force on protesters marching against violence aimed at minorities in the neighbouring country (Bangladesh).BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi claimed that TMC govt's action has shown that Hindus in the state are not allowed to express their pain, accusing West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee of drawing from the agenda of ""eradication of sanatan dharma"", a reference to a controversial speech made by DMK's Udhayanidhi Stalin.In this context, he cited the inflammatory comment of TMC functionary Madan Mitra that ""Lord Ram was a Muslim"", and the campaign by its MLA Humayun Kabir, who has since been sacked from the party, for building a Babri mosque and flayed the state's governing party for its policy vis-a-vis Hindus.He said that the protest by Hindu bodies was ""peaceful"", but the participants were targeted by state police. Police, on the other hand, said that they had resorted to baton-charge to disperse protesters after they breached barricades in an attempt to get closer to the Bangladesh deputy High Commission office in central Kolkata.Trivedi further added that the mindset of Bangladesh's Jamaat-e-Islami is being reflected in Trinamool Congress govt's approach.""Jamaat-e-Islami is orchestrating targeted attacks on Hindus and TMC is behind targeted action against Hindus,"" he alleged.","BJP slams state police for its use of force on protesters marching against violence aimed at minorities in Bangladesh.

NEW DELHI: Delhi high court suspended Tuesday the life imprisonment awarded to expelled BJP functionary and former four-time UP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar in the 2017 Unnao rape case, citing that he had spent more than seven years in jail while his appeal remained pending.Sengar, 59, will not walk free immediately as he continues to serve a 10-year sentence in a separate case involving the death of the survivor’s father in custody. His appeal is pending before HC.Granting relief till disposal of Sengar’s appeal against his 2019 trial court conviction in the rape case, a bench of Justices Subramonium Prasad and Harish Vaidyanathan Shankar laid down stringent conditions for release, if and when it occurs. Sengar must furnish a personal bond of Rs 15 lakh with three sureties of the same amount, all residents of New Delhi. The court barred him from entering a 5km radius of the survivor’s residence and from threatening her or her mother, warning any breach would lead to cancellation of bail.He has been directed to stay in New Delhi during pendency of appeal, deposit his passport, remain available to serve the remaining sentence if his conviction is upheld, and report to a police station every Monday at 10am.The bench said the survivor is expected to continue to receive CRPF protection. It also directed the DCP of the area where she lives to personally ensure and supervise her security.Appearing for Sengar, senior advocate N Hariharan and advocate SPM Tripathi said continued incarceration after more than seven years, with the appeal yet to be decided, would violate Article 21 of the Constitution.Rejecting the argument that Sengar should remain in custody due to threat perception to the survivor, the court said such a position was “not a tenable argument” and added that it would undermine “the laudable work of our police/paramilitary forces”.The bench recorded that accommodation for the survivor was being provided by the state and DCW was responsible for ensuring suitable housing, directing that the arrangement continue. It said the survivor remained free to approach the court during pendency of the appeal.","Kuldeep Singh Sengar, 59, will not walk free immediately as he continues to serve a 10-year sentence in a separate case involving the death of the survivor’s father in custody.
