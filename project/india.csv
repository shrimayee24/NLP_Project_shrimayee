""Not water, but poison was distributed in Indore, and the administration remained in deep slumber,"" he said.Alleging corruption in all the central govt schemes including Jal Jeevan Mission that Modi ""never gets tired of trumpeting"" about, Kharge pointed out that Indore has won the ""cleanest city"" award for eight consecutive years under the Centre's ""swacch sarvekshan survey"". The Congress brass, without naming the viral spat between a senior MP minister Kailash Vijayvargiya and a journalist, said the govt showed brazen arrogance when the families of the victims needed solace. ""When ministers are questioned, they resort to abuse and intimidation. Drunk on the arrogance of power, they turn the tables on the journalists. The entire machinery swings into action to cover up the misgovernance of BJP govts,"" Kharge said.Asking when would action be initiated against officials and leaders, Rahul said clean water is not a favour, but its ""right to life"" that has been destroyed by the ""insensitive"" govt. Kharge said the govt has fed India with empty promises for last 11 years, but has ""failed to provide either clean water or clean air"".","Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge and Lok Sabha LoP Rahul Gandhi targeted the governing BJP over deaths from contaminated water.

BARUIPUR: ""I will make three ghosts walk,"" said Trinamool Congress national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee as he ushered in three people on stage - two men from Metiabruz in Kolkata and a woman from Kakdwip in South 24 Parganas - who he said had been marked dead during the SIR of Bengal's voter rolls.Flagging off Trinamool's campaign for the 2026 assembly election with a rally in Baruipur on Friday, Abhishek made it clear that SIR would be the front-and-centre of the party's poll pitch.Abhishek said, ""The day before yesterday, we visited the EC's office in Delhi. I asked (chief election commissioner) Gyanesh Kumar to publish the list of Bangladeshis whose names have been deleted. He couldn't do it. Instead, he raised his finger at me. I told him, you are nominated, we are elected. Who are you showing aggression to?""""They thought Trinamool would go on the backfoot if they showed slight aggression. But, we have shown what it is to be a Bengali. One day Abhishek Banerjee went (to meet the CEC), Mamata Banerjee will go, too. Who will save you then?"" Abhishek added.Introducing the three people - Monirul Islam Molla, Harikrishna Giri and Maya Das - who were marked 'dead', Abhishek said there were many more such instances. ""In this (South 24 Parganas) district, 24 people who are alive have been shown dead by EC,"" he said.The TMC leader in Lok Sabha then went on to slam BJP, saying: ""In the name of logical discrepancies, 1.3 crore people were sent notices to attend SIR hearings. BJP can send (legal) notices to me and Trinamool workers. But why are notices being sent to common people? In 2016, they (BJP) made people stand in line for demonetisation. Ten years later, they are making them stand in line for SIR.""","Abhishek Banerjee: ""I will make three ghosts walk"" during rally in Baruipur, West Bengal.

Karnataka HC: Third parties can challenge lok adalat awards if fraud is alleged,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/karnataka-hc-third-parties-can-challenge-lok-adalat-awards-if-fraud-is-alleged/articleshow/126315652.cms,"Karnataka HC

BENGALURU: Karnataka HC has held that even a third party can, depending on the facts of the case, challenge a lok adalat award through a writ petition if the award is alleged to have been secured fraudulently by excluding a proper and necessary party.The observation was made by Justice M Nagaprasanna while quashing a decree passed by a civil court in Hosapete, Vijayanagara district, arising from a compromise recorded before a lok adalat.The case is related to a land partition dispute in Kamalapur village. A compromise petition had been entered into before the lok adalat between Nagamma Nagalapura and the children of Karadantappa, both belonging to different branches of the family of Khemmani Hanumanthappa, the original owner of the properties. Guramma and her children, who also claimed to be part of the same family, were not arrayed as parties to the suit.Challenging the decree dated July 8, 2023, Guramma and her children contended that they were necessary parties and the compromise was entered into in collusion, with the intent of denying them their legitimate share in property. They had initially filed an appeal but withdrew it after being advised that an appeal was not maintainable against a decree drawn from a lok adalat compromise.They subsequently approached HC. Opposing the plea, the respondents argued that the writ petition was not maintainable as Guramma and her children were not parties to the original partition suit.After examining the records, provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, and earlier judgments, Justice Nagaprasanna held that in certain circumstances, a third party is entitled to invoke writ jurisdiction to challenge a lok adalat award if fraud is alleged on the grounds that the party was deliberately not impleaded despite being necessary to the proceedings.Allowing the petition, the court ordered restoration of the civil suit before Hosapete court. It also directed that any financial transactions carried out pursuant to the compromise should be deposited before the trial court, remaining subject to the final outcome of partition proceedings.",Karnataka HC has held that even a third party can challenge a lok adalat award through a writ petition.
