Amendment to ensure capital punishment for convicted rapists

'Please come back to work'

NEW DELHI: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee , who is under all-round attack over the Kolkata rape-murder case, on Wednesday trained her guns at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and warned of adverse consequences for other states if the BJP tried to instigate trouble in Bengal.""Some people think this is Bangladesh. I love Bangladesh; they speak like us and share our culture.But remember, Bangladesh is a separate country and India is a separate country. Modi Babu you are using your party to cause fire here. But remember, if you burn Bengal .... Assam, northeast, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, and Delhi won't remain unaffected. We will disturb your chair also,"" a cornered Mamata said at the Trinamool Congress Chhatra Parishad (TMCP) foundation day rally.Mamata unleashed a scathing attack at the BJP which has been spearheading protests against the brutal rape and murder of a trainee doctor at Kolkata's R G Kar Medical College and Hospital and asked the Trinamool workers to respond. ""The time has come to resist and protest when you are insulted. When faced with ugly attacks, do not take it lying down. How you respond is up to you,"" the Trinamool Congress chief said.West Bengal BJP chief and Union minister Sukanta Majumdar accused Mamata of making ""anti-national"" remarks and shot off a letter to Union home minister Amit Shah urging the Centre to take cognisance of her statements. The West Bengal BJP leader charged Mamata with blatantly endorsing revenge politics and urged Amit Shah to safeguard the interests of people of West Bengal.""It is unthinkable and unprecedented for a chief minister, who is constitutionally bound to rise above partisan attitudes, to make such intimidating statements that pose a threat to democracy,"" he said.Mamata, on the other hand, accused BJP of hatching a conspiracy to derail probe into the rape-murder incident.“They called the bandh since they wanted political dividends over a dead body. The BJP is trying to exploit the emotions of ordinary people in the wake of the death of the young woman. They want to malign Bengal and plotted a conspiracy to derail the probe into her death so that the victim and her family do not get justice,” Mamata said.She also alleged that the BJP was ""indulging in large-scale cyber crimes using AI, causing social unrest"".""We have dedicated this day to the RG Kar doctor. We want justice but BJP today called for a bandh. They don't want justice, they are only trying to defame Bengal,"" Mamata Banerjee said.On the demand for her resignation in the wake of the RG Kar hospital incident, she said, “I will ask BJP why Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not resign owning up to his failure to prevent atrocities and sexual attacks on women in Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur and Assam. I ask why only an accused was killed in an encounter in Assam?""The BJP is making such demands as it has suffered a string of defeats in elections and knows that it won't be able to win in future, Banerjee said.Mamata Banerjee announced that her government would pass an amendment to existing laws next week to ensure capital punishment to convicted rapists. Banerjee said that she would sit for dharna outside Raj Bhavan here if the governor delays in giving assent to the amended bill or forwards it to the President for ratification.The chief minister also said that the TMC will launch a movement from Saturday at the state's grassroots to create pressure on the Centre to pass legislation for capital punishment of convicted rapists.“We will pass the amended bill in a special session of the assembly next week. We will then send it to the governor for his nod. We will stage dharna outside Raj Bhavan if he sits on the bill,” she said and added ""women will be at the forefront of the proposed dharna accompanied by 'their brothers'"".Mamata Banerjee urged the agitating junior doctors of Bengal, who have struck work for 20 days, now to urgently consider returning to duty.“I have remained sympathetic towards the cause of the doctors from the very beginning since they were seeking justice for their colleague. We did not take any action against them although so many days have passed since the incident. We understand your pain. But please come back to work now since patients are suffering,” she appealed.The police recovered the body of the woman's postgraduate trainee doctor from the seminar hall of the RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on August 9. The junior doctors of state-run hospitals have been on cease work since that evening, demanding justice for the victim and strong security measures in hospitals.Banerjee added no FIR was lodged against any doctor so far as she did not want any medic's career to be plagued by police cases.",West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee is under all-round attack over the Kolkata rape-murder case.

NEW DELHI: Former Jharkhand chief minister Champai Soren on Wednesday resigned from the primary membership and all posts of Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM).""Today I resigned from the primary membership and all posts of Jharkhand Mukti Morcha. Our struggle will continue on the issues of tribals, natives, Dalits, backward people and common people of Jharkhand,"" he said in a post on X.Soren had met home minister Amit Shah in New Delhi earlier this week and had announced he would be joining the saffron party.""My decision (to join BJP ) is in the interest of Jharkhand... I am used to struggles,"" Soren said.The former CM will join the BJP on August 30.Asked about the allegation that he is under ""surveillance"", the former CM said he is not afraid of any situationAssam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Wednesday accused the Jharkhand government of spying on its minister and former chief minister Champai Soren, who is set to join the BJP later this week.Sarma, who is incharge of Jharkhand BJP, claimed that two sub-inspectors (SIs) of Special Branch of Jharkhand Police were tracking Champai Soren's movements in Delhi and were caught by the ex-chief minister's men and handed over to the Delhi Police.News agency PTI, quoting sources, said the two Jharkhand cops were picked up from the hotel and questioned by a team of Delhi Police. The two police officers were allowed to go after questioning. The two said that they had come to Delhi on routine duty. Sarma also expressed apprehensions about Champai Soren's phone being tapped.Soren, when asked about ""surveillance"" by Jharkhand government, said he is not afraid of any situation. ""I am used to struggles,"" Soren said and indicated that he will resign from JMM and as a minister later today.The former Jharkhand chief minister, who will join the BJP on August 30 in Jharkhand capital Ranchi, said he had taken the decision to join the saffron party to save tribal identity and existence, which is at stake in the state's Santhal Pargana region due to “rampant” infiltration from Bangladesh.""We all know that Champai Soren is a minister in the Jharkhand government, he is also an ex-chief minister. He has decided to join BJP on August 30, but he is yet to resign and remains a minister…but his own government has put him under surveillance,"" Sarma claimed at a press conference here.""Soren had been put under surveillance five months ago, even before he was in talks with the BJP,"" the Assam CM claimed.He claimed the two SIs had been following Soren on his Delhi trips, taking the same flight and staying in the same five-star hotel as the minister.""Champai Soren's people spotted these two persons at the Delhi hotel on Tuesday and nabbed them. Initially, they claimed to be journalists but later admitted to be Special Branch SIs. They were handed over to Chanakyapuri Police Station there and Soren has also filed an FIR,"" Sarma said.The senior JMM leader, who briefly held the chief minister's post after Hemant Soren 's resignation, said only the saffron party seems serious over the issue of tribals, while others are indulging in vote bank politics.Champai was sworn in as 12th chief minister of Jharkhand on February 2 after Hemant Soren was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate in a money-laundering case. The party had then chosen him over Hemant's wife Kalpana Soren to lead the Jharkhand government. However, the bonhomie was short-lived. Less than a week after Hemant Soren was released on bail on June 28, Champai had to step down to make way for his predecessor.The senior JMM leader has claimed that he was insulted and humiliated by the party and was forced to choose an alternative path for himself. Champai had taken to social media on August 18 to share details of how he was marginalised within the party and abruptly asked to resign as chief minister. Champai also alleged that all his government programmes in the first week of July, when he was the chief minister, were abruptly cancelled by the party leadership without his knowledge.",Former Jharkhand chief minister Champai Soren on Wednesday resigned from the primary membership and all posts of Jharkshand Mukti Morcha.
