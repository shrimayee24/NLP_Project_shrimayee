Phir uthi akhir sada touheed ki Punjab se, Marde-kaamil ne jagya Hind to Phir khwaab se.

CHANDIGARH: In his final direct message to the people of Punjab , former Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh made an impassioned appeal, urging voters to defend the nation’s democratic ideals and uphold the sanctity of the Constitution . The heartfelt letter, written during the Lok Sabha elections , showcased his deep connection to his home state and his concern for the challenges it faces.Dr Singh began by addressing Punjabis as “warriors” and criticised the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for allegedly targeting “Punjab, Punjabis, and Punjabiyat”. He spoke of the sacrifices made by the state’s farmers, highlighting the death of 750 farmers, most of whom hailed from Punjab, during the monthslong protests at Delhi’s borders.Taking aim at Prime Minister Narendra Modi , Dr Singh pointed out the unfulfilled promise of doubling farmers’ incomes by 2022. He accused the BJP-led govt of implementing policies that, over the past decade, eroded farmers’ earnings. In contrast, he recalled the achievements of his govt, including a Rs 72,000 crore loan waiver for 3.73 crore farmers, increased minimum support prices (MSP), and ex panded agricultural production and exports.Dr Singh’s letter also highlighted the Congress-UPA govt’s contributions to Punjab’s development. He cited major initiatives such as the Amritsar-Kolkata Industrial Corridor , now part of the Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor, which passes through Amritsar, Jalandhar, and Ludhiana. He mentioned landmark projects like the oil refinery in Bathinda (2011), IIT Ropar (2008), National Law University in Patiala (2006), and the Shaheed Bhagat Singh Memorial at Khatkar Kalan.The govt also provided funds for the development of Talwandi Sabo and Anandpur Sahib during the tercentenary celebrations of Guru Granth Sahib’s Gurta Gaddi. He expressed concern over the current state of politics, accusing the ruling party of fostering discord and dehumanisation.He called on the people of Punjab to counter these forces by voting for unity, peace, and progress. “With folded hands, I appeal to each one of you to give love, peace, fraternity, and harmony a chance in India,” he wrote.He urged youth to exercise caution and vote for a brighter, inclusive future. He ended his appeal with a couplet by Allama Iqbal: “","Dr Singh began by addressing Punjabis as ‘warriors’ and criticised the Bharatiya Janata Party.
