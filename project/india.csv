This will be only the fourth time - and the first in nearly 50 years - when a speaker will not be elected by consensus.

Birla will be the fifth person after M A Ayyangar, G S Dhillon, Balram Jakhar and GMC Balayogi to hold the office two times in a row.

With NDA having an official strength of 293 in the 543-strong House, the stage is set for Birla, third-term MP from Kota, to get a second term as speaker.

BJP-led ruling NDA has 293 MPs in Lok Sabha which seats 543 parliamentarians.

YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, chief of YSRCP, said his party would back NDA in the Speaker election. Ex-Andhra Pradesh CM has 4 MPs in the House.

The opposition INDIA bloc has 233 MPs in the Lower House.

INDIA tally includes 29 MPs of TMC, which has said Congress unilaterally picked a candidate.

Motion proposing name of Speaker can be adopted by a voice vote. If opposition insists on a division of votes, paper slips will be distributed to MPs to vote since seats have not been allocated to the new Mps for the electronic display system.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be moving motion to elect Om Birla as Lok Sabha Speaker.

NEW DELHI: Failing to reach a consensus over the Speaker candidate for the 18th Lok Sabha , the opposition INDIA bloc has fielded K Suresh against BJP-led NDA 's pick Om Birla , who is in contest for the second stint.Birla, MP from Rajasthan's Kota, was renominated by the NDA for the Speaker post on Tuesday.Union defence minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday roped in INDIA bloc leaders to build a consensus on the Speaker name but failed to break the ice as the opposition wanted to name their candidate for the deputy speaker post in return for their support to NDA's Speaker pick.After hectic parleys and long discussions, the INDIA bloc decided to field K Suresh an, eight-time Congress MP from Kerala.While the opposition has put all its weight into ensuring the Speaker election is not a cakewalk for the NDA, the Speaker election has become one of a kind as it will be held after 48 years.","Om Birla will be the fifth person after M A Ayyangar, G S Dhillon, Balram Jakhar and GMC Balayogi to hold the office two times in a row.

"In his first constitutional post, Rahul to be Lok Sabha leader of opposition",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-his-first-constitutional-post-rahul-to-be-lok-sabha-leader-of-opposition/articleshow/111268028.cms,"Honour wishes of CWC on LOP post, Kharge urges Rahul

NEW DELHI: Rahul Gandhi will be leader of opposition in Lok Sabha , in a major leg up for the Gandhi scion in his parliamentary responsibilities which is widely viewed as laying the ground for an aggressive and confrontational face-off with a dominant BJP.The expectation that politics in coming days will be a ' Modi vs Rahul' duel got another fillip by the fact that as LoP - the first constitutional position he will hold - Rahul is likely to be chairman of the all-important Public Accounts Committee that has the primary function of examining CAG reports, and can also seek probes from the govt. The panel, though with govt majority which decides issues by vote, has proved to be testy for many regimes. Besides, he would also be a member of various collegiums comprising the PM and CJI or govt nominees for selection of chiefs of important investigation and transparency agencies - CBI, Lokpal, CVC, CEC/Election Commissioners and CIC.In a late evening announcement, AICC general secretary K C Venugopal said Congress parliamentary party chairperson Sonia Gandhi has written to pro tem speaker Bhartruhari Mahtab appointing Rahul as LoP. Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge said Rahul would become the ""voice of the last person standing"". AICC treasurer Ajay Maken said, ""Rahul has always been the most fearless voice among the opposition, and as LoP, his impact will be even more profound"".The decision to name Rahul Gandhi as leader of opposition in Lok Sabha lifted the suspense on the issue that has been agitating minds in Congress since results of the 2024 elections were declared, and especially after Congress Working Committee on June 9 passed a resolution urging Rahul to take up the position.In the meeting, Kharge had personally pushed the issue by telling Rahul that he was anyway playing the key role of mediation and coordination, and had gained the desired experience to take up the formal post. Besides, he had urged Rahul to honour the wishes of the party's apex body.The appointment comes in the wake of Congress being in high spirits despite losing the third consecutive election to the Modi-led BJP, encouraged by the fact that it has revived in key regions of the country and performed admirably despite the adverse circumstances of extreme polarisation, funds crunch, pressure from agencies and sidelining in media under the BJP dispensation. Besides, the strong showing and unity of the INDIA bloc has raised the prospect of a spirited fightback in the future.As the head of a rejuvenated opposition led by a strong Congress strength, the party believes Rahul can take on Modi with a focused targeting of govt on issues of governance. The Congress leader is credited with taking on BJP at a time when regional parties were cagey about its blowback. He also put ""communalism"" back on centre stage in the face of popular belief that it would repel Hindu voters - as headlined by his two countrywide yatras.Rahul himself said at a press conference last week, when he remarked, ""Earlier, only Congress was not scared of Modi, now other parties are also not scared of him.""","Rahul Gandhi will be leader of opposition in Lok Sabha. He is likely to be chairman of the all-important Public Accounts Committee. Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge said Rahul would become the ""voice of the last person standing"" The appointment comes in the wake of Congress being in high spirits.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111268033,imgsize-955092,width-400,resizemode-4/111268033.jpg"
"NDA sticks with Birla, Congress picks Suresh for 4th-ever Speaker contest",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nda-sticks-with-birla-congress-picks-suresh-for-4th-ever-speaker-contest/articleshow/111268019.cms,"We want speakers to be elected via consensus:

Rijiju

NEW DELHI: In the first trial of strength for the newly-elected Modi govt, opposition on Tuesday decided to field its candidate K Suresh against NDA 's nominee Om Birla for the post of Lok Sabha Speaker .The contest, which had looked likely, became inevitable after govt turned down the opposition's demand for the post of deputy speaker as a pre-condition for facilitating a consensus on a fresh term for Birla, the outgoing speaker. Govt refused to accept the opposition's demand, saying the issue of deputy speaker could be negotiated later.Though this will be only the fourth time - and the first in nearly 50 years - when a speaker will not be elected by consensus, the contest on Wednesday is only in line with the intense acrimony that marked the LS campaign and has since persisted. The post was contested in 1952, the first Lok Sabha, in 1967 and 1976.With NDA having an official strength of 293 in the 543-strong House, the stage is set for Birla, third-term MP from Kota, to get a second term as speaker. He will be the fifth person after M A Ayyangar, G S Dhillon, Balram Jakhar and GMC Balayogi to hold the office two times in a row. Only Jakhar completed two full terms.Congress's Suresh is a veteran of eight terms from Kerala but his choice has equally, if not more, to do with him being a Dalit. Congress and some allies are seeking to build on the advantage they are perceived to have gained among Dalits on the strength of their allegation that BJP under Modi planned to scrap caste quotas.Defence minister Rajnath Singh held several rounds of discussions with opposition leaders, including Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, for a consensus over the speaker’s choice. However, the opposition insisted on a commitment for the deputy speaker’s post going to one of their own. Govt, which had looked uncomfortable with the idea, did not agree to the condition saying the issue should be left for later.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said as per convention, the deputy speaker’s post was spared for the opposition, a claim refuted by NDA, which cited multiple instances under Congress regimes of both positions being held by nominees of the treasury benches.“For the last two days, we have been in contact with main opposition parties, talked to their floor leaders regarding the post of speaker. We want speakers to be elected unopposed and through consensus. We appealed to them to support the speaker candidate but they demanded the deputy speaker’s post. We said it is not right to conduct elections for speaker and deputy speaker posts together. We request them for no election for speaker,” parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju said.Though only the second fiddle as deputy speaker gets to preside over House proceedings in the absence of the speaker, the holder of the post can strike a discordant note for the govt in a fractious Parliament.BJP has the entire NDA flock sticking together. In contrast, TMC made public its annoyance with Congress over what it called the unilateral declaration of Suresh’s candidature.JD(U) leader and Union minister Rajiv Ranjan Singh ‘Lalan’ said Birla’s name was decided unanimously by all NDA parties. After the decision, Birla called on PM Modi, who was present in Parliament. Later, home minister Amit Shah, Rajnath Singh, BJP president J P Nadda and NDA leaders handed over Birla’s nomination papers to Lok Sabha secretary general Utpal Kumar Singh.If the opposition insists on a division during the election on Wednesday, votes will be cast on paper slips as the electronic display system cannot be used because members of the new House are yet to be allotted seats.","Om Birla, third-term MP from Kota, to get a second term as speaker.

"From Ram to Hindu Rashtra to Palestine, slogans create storm in teacup",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/for-ram-to-hindu-rashtra-to-palestine-slogans-create-storm-in-teacup/articleshow/111267776.cms,"NEW DELHI: It was the day of religious invocations and storms in the teacup on the second day of MPs oath-taking in the Lok Sabha. The repeated chants of Jai Shri Ram from BJP triggered much mirth as Samajwadi Party's showcasing of its MP representing Ayodhya (Faizabad constituency), a sore defeat for BJP, checked the enthusiasm in the governing camp. Even as it dominated the proceedings through the day, All India Majlis-E-Ittehadul Muslimeen chief Asaduddin Owaisi's hailing of Palestine after the oath triggered belated protests from BJP, leading to a minor disturbance. BJP's Chhatrapal Gangwar from Bareilly said ""Jai Hindu Rashtra "", which stoked protests from the opposition bench that called it ""against the Constitution"".The oath by Owaisi, who also used an Islamic war cry, was over and he was firmly ensconced in his seat with the proceedings smoothly under way, before Shobha Karandlaje questioned the invocation of Palestine by the Hyderabad veteran, in what was an afterthought. She was joined by NDA colleague Shrikant Shinde and C M Ramesh which led to some commotion. Sitting in his place, Owaisi stood his ground. But the Chair, Radha Mohan Singh, clarified only the oath was going on record, urging members to not create any disturbance. Earlier, pro tem Speaker Bhartruhari Mahtab had said chants and invocations should be avoided, but it was ignored by the members throughout.Interestingly, when Owaisi's name was called out and he was proceeding to the podium, BJP benches raised 'Jai Shri Ram'and 'Bharat Mata ki Jai' slogans , as if to tease him. Later, when Arun Govil of BJP raised 'Jai Shri Ram', SP's Dharmendra Yadav asked why BJP was not objecting to it, and he was joined by others. Then, Dharmendra loudly shouted 'Jai Awadhesh' and the Faizabad MP, as if on cue, stood up with raised folded hands in mock acknowledgement of the assembly - a grandstanding that triggered laughter all around.The to and fro continued. The icing on the opposition's cake was when Awadhesh Prasad's name was called. This time, the opposition benches broke into 'Jai Shri Ram', and the BJP side was mum. While INDIA bloc handed BJP a solid defeat in Lok Sabha elections in Uttar Pradesh, it is the upstaging of the saffron party in Faizabad constituency that the opposition has been using to rub it in. It proved effective in Parliament for the first two days.The plea for help for troubled regions attracted attention too. The oaths of Alfred ken-Ngam Arthur and Bimol Akoijam, MPs from Manipur, which has been roiled by ethnic conflict for over a year, led to lusty cheers of ""Manipur, Manipur"" from Congress and the opposition, with the members themselves seeking ""justice for Manipur"". Meanwhile, Owaisi hailed Palestine.","All India Majlis-E-Ittehadul Muslimeen chief Asaduddin Owaisi's hailing of Palestine after the oath triggered belated protests from BJP.

During Indira Gandhi's tenure as PM, R K Khadilkar from Congress was deputy speaker from 1967-1969, Poonawala said.He also shared details of states governed by Congress and its allies where both the posts were held by the same party. In West Bengal, TMC's Biman Banerjee is the speaker and his party colleague Ashish Banerjee is the deputy speaker.

Article 93

NEW DELHI: For the first time in nearly 50 years, elections for the Lok Sabha Speaker will see a spirited contest as the ruling BJP-led NDA alliance has been unable to strike a consensus with the now much stronger Congress-led opposition bloc INDIA.While the NDA has fielded former Speaker Om Birla , INDIA has picked Congress leader and senior-most Lok Sabha MP Kodikunnil Suresh.The Speaker for the 18th Lok Sabha will be elected on June 26. On June 27, President Droupadi Murmu is scheduled to address a joint sitting of both Houses of Parliament.This is only the third time that elections will be held for the Lok Sabha Speaker post.As per the Lok Sabha Secretariat, the first such contest was in 1952 between GV Mavalankar and Shankar Shantaram. Mavalankar won with 394 votes whereas Shantaram got 55.The second such fight happened in 1976 between Baliram Bhagat and Jagannath Rao. Bhagat won with 344 votes while Jagannath Rao got 58.The latest contest is likely to see a much narrower victory margin.In the just concluded 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the NDA secured 293 seats -- well above the halfway mark of 272 -- while INDIA bagged 234 seats. A total of 16 seats were won by Independents or other regional parties.Before Suresh filed his nomination for the post, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had said that INDIA bloc was ready to extend support to NDA's Speaker candidate, but the post of Deputy Speaker should be given to the opposition.""Rajnath Singh said that he would call Mallikarjun Kharge but he has not done that yet ... PM Modi is asking for cooperation from Opposition but our leader is getting insulted,"" said Rahul Gandhi, shortly after which K Suresh --an 8-time MP -- filed his nomination for the Speaker seat.NDA candidate Birla was unanimously elected as the Speaker of the previous 17th Lok Sabha.Birla's name was proposed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and was supported by all major opposition parties, including Congress, TMC, DMK, and BJD. The YSRCP and TDP also supported Birla's candidature.Article 93 of Constitution that deals with the Speaker and deputy Speaker of the House of the People, states: ""The House of the People shall, as soon as may be, choose two members of the House to be respectively Speaker and Deputy Speaker thereof and, so often as the office of Speaker or Deputy Speaker becomes vacant, the House shall choose another member to be Speaker or Deputy Speaker, as the case may be.""","For the first time in nearly 50 years, elections for the Lok Sabha Speaker will see a spirited contest.

This disclosure came after Udham Singh Nagar's health department, in collaboration with an NGO, conducted tests on these men and initiated their treatment at an ART centre. The process is on for testing other family members of the infected men as well.

Other members would become the bride's relatives to avoid suspicion. After several cases were reported from parts of UP and Uttarakhand, seven members of the gang, including the woman and her mother, were held and sent to jail in Muzaffarnagar.Jail superintendent in Muzaffarnagar, Sitaram Sharma, said on Tuesday, ""Once in jail, her medical examination was conducted at the district hospital where her HIV-positive status was confirmed. Ever since, her antiretroviral therapy (ART) treatment has been going on."" During the arrest, the woman had revealed she had ""married"" five times, including three men from Uttarakhand. Police, however, suspect there are more cases.While efforts are now on in Muzaffarnagar and other regions of UP to trace the ""grooms"", the health department in Uttarakhand has confirmed that the ""three men she came in physical contact with within the state are now HIV positive"". This disclosure came after Udham Singh Nagar's health department, in collaboration with an NGO, conducted tests on these men and initiated their treatment at an ART centre. The process is on for testing other family members of the infected men as well.The woman and her mother belong to US Nagar district of Uttarakhand. Chief medical officer of US Nagar, Dr Manoj Kumar Sharma, said, ""Three people who had contact with her have tested positive as well and are receiving ART treatment...""","The revelation has put health department officials of both the states in a fix. They are now desperately hunting for ""grooms"" she'd been with.

Buzz around Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal's arrest by CBI; Here is what probe agency had to say,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/buzz-around-delhi-cm-arvind-kejriwals-arrest-by-cbi-here-is-what-probe-agency-had-to-say/articleshow/111272354.cms,"NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Tuesday stayed a trial court's order granting bail to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in the excise policy case. A vacation bench of Justice Sudhir Kumar Jain allowed Enforcement Directorate's application seeking a stay on the bail order. The court said vacation judge Niyay Bindu had passed the order without going through ED 's entire material on record, which reflected ""perversity"".The HC bench said it couldn't comprehend how the trial court says in para 16 of the order that it was not possible to go through thousands of pages of documents filed by the respective parties but in para 36 asserts that relevant arguments and contentions raised on behalf of the parties have been dealt with.Taking note of the trial court's observation that ED's action was ""mala fide"" as material against Kejriwal was available with ED in July 2022 but he was called only in Aug 2023 and that the agency had failed to deal with this objection of the Delhi CM, the HC bench said, ""The vacation judge...following judicial discipline should not have observed in para 27 of the impugned order that there was mala fide on the part of ED, particularly in light of an observation made in judgment dated 09.04.2024...""The bench pointed out that the coordinate bench of the HC had in that order observed that there was absence of any mala fide intention on the part of ED. The HC was then dealing with the legality of the arrest of Kejriwal by ED. HC pointed out that although SC granted leave against that judgment dated April 9, it did not stay its operation.Responding to the argument by Kejriwal's counsel that his arrest was bad and the April 9 judgment of the high court upholding his arrest by ED had also not attained finality, HC said the same is required to be dealt with at the time of consideration of the agency's main petition.The bench added that at this stage, it cannot be said that the arrest and remand of Kejriwal was not in accordance with the law and that his personal liberty was curtailed without following the procedure established by law.Referring to ED's contention before the trial court about the vicarious liability of the CM under Section 70 of PMLA, the bench said ED's written note had mentioned it but did not find a place in the trial court order. The section deals with ""offences by companies"" and the agency is of the view that this empowered it to book a political party too.The HC bench rejected the argument of senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi that Kejriwal did not misuse the interim bail granted by SC on May 10 after taking into consideration all objections of ED, including objections/contentions raised in the present petition.Citing the SC bail order dated May 10, the HC bench said though there is no allegation of misuse of bail, the CM had not been granted interim bail on merit but in the context of the Lok Sabha elections.The HC also rejected the trial court's finding that unless and until the exercise of tracing the remaining amount of the proceeds of crime, i.e. Rs 60 crore, was completed by ED, Kejriwal cannot remain behind bars without proper evidence against him.""The perusal of the note submitted by ED before the special judge/vacation judge reflected that the said plea was encountered by ED but not sufficiently and adequately dealt with by the vacation judge,"" the HC said.""The vacation judge while passing the impugned order did not appropriately appreciate the material/documents submitted on record and pleas taken by ED, and the averments/grounds as raised in the petition under section 439(2) of the code (CrPC) require serious consideration...Accordingly, the present application is allowed and the operation of the impugned order is stayed,"" concluded the court.Section 439(2) of CrPC, 1973, gives the high court or sessions court the power to cancel bail granted under Section 436 of CrPC. It also gives them the power to direct that a person who has been released on bail be arrested and committed to custody.On ASG Raju's contention that the observations of the vacation judge in the order were not legally tenable and that the order was ""perverse"", the HC bench said it requires further consideration. Referring to the argument that the bail order was passed on the basis of irrelevant considerations, HC said these points are required to be considered by the roster bench when it considers the main petition.","Delhi high court stays a trial court's order granting bail to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in excise policy case.

The sodium levels in her body were also low.""She had hypoglycemia, a condition in which the blood sugar (glucose) level is lower than the standard range. Ideally, the blood sugar levels should be 70-100. However, at the time Atishi reached the hospital, her blood sugar levels were around 40. Hypoglycemia needs immediate treatment, especially in these weather conditions,"" Dr Kumar said.""We kept her in the ICU and she was immediately put on IV fluids. All the blood work was done.

On June 20, Atishi initiated her hunger strike to demand water from Haryana.
