"AAP MLA Balyan gets bail in extortion case, re-arrested on MCOCA charges",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/aap-mla-balyan-gets-bail-in-extortion-case-re-arrested-on-mcoca-charges/articleshow/115987496.cms,"'Investigation can't pick and choose evidence'

NEW DELHI: A short while after Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Naresh Balyan was granted bail in an extortion case by a Delhi court on Wednesday, he was arrested again by Delhi Police in a separate FIR. Balyan was taken into custody on charges under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA). He will be produced in Dwarka court on Thursday.Reacting to the fresh arrest, AAP said, ""BJP yet again misused its agencies and imposed MCOCA, misusing terrorism laws on the legislators of AAP. This arrest is only to silence Arvind Kejriwal , who is regularly questioning Union home minister Amit Shah on the failed law and order situation in Delhi.""During the hearing of his bail plea in the extortion case Wednesday, Delhi Police informed the court that they would arrest the MLA under MCOCA. ""We will be arresting him right now,"" special public prosecutor Akhand Pratap Singh submitted before the court of additional chief judicial magistrate Paras Dalal, who rejected the prosecution's request for 14-day judicial custody.Advocate Sujan Singh and others appeared for Balyan. The court dismissed their plea for his arrest in a fresh case filed under MCOCA, saying there can be no direction from it to IO, who may proceed as per law. The court said the plea was not maintainable. The court, saying it is not convinced with the investigation carried so far, observed, ""The alleged audio clip which is the main link of alleged criminal conspiracy betweengangster Kapil and present accused/applicant has yet not been forensically examined or verified despite having been seized 15 months back.""Noting that Balyan himself filed three complaints dated Dec 19, 2023, March 7, 2023 and May 5, 2023 of having received threats from gangster Kapil, the court said that the three victims who joined the investigation denied having ever heard about the involvement of Balyan with gangster Kapil's gang.""The investigation cannot pick and choose as to the evidence gathered during investigation. It was the duty of IO to forthwith investigate the authenticity of the alleged audio conversation seized in Aug 2023 and then even the complaints of the accused/ applicant should have been investigated. Till date, no other associate of accused/ applicant has been named or arrested. There is no evidence of any criminal nexus till date and no money trail has been found in the investigation. Even all the allegations are of year 2023 and none of the victims is stated to have been threatened since then,"" said the court.The court also granted one day to Balyan's counsel to file a reply on prosecution's application to collect his voice sample. In the morning, police had moved an application before the court of additional sessions judge Vandana Jain in Dwarka court seeking Balyan's interrogation in relation to the MCOCA case while he was in police custody in the extortion case. The Dwarka court allowed this application. In the evening, police told the court of ACJM Dalal in Rouse Avenue that they were arresting Balyan as he did not cooperate during the interrogation.In a statement, AAP said, ""Delhi is becoming a den of gangsters and extortionists. Balyan is himself a victim who received threats to life and extortion calls from gangsters against whom he filed five written complaints from 2022 and 2023 but no action was taken. On the contrary, false cases have been fabricated by BJP against him. However, people of Delhi are aware of these tactics and will deliver a fitting response in the assembly elections.""","Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Naresh Balyan was granted bail in an extortion case by a Delhi court. On Wednesday, he was arrested again by Delhi Police in a separate FIR.

"'Dada experienced in taking both morning, evening oaths': Eknath Shinde's cheeky dig at Ajit Pawar",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dada-experienced-in-taking-both-morning-evening-oaths-eknath-shindes-cheeky-dig-at-ajit-pawar/articleshow/115976864.cms,"Eknath Shinde (left), and Ajit Pawar

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra's caretaker chief minister Eknath Shinde on Wednesday took a cheeky dig at his ally Ajit Pawar - reminding the NCP chief of an early-morning oath as deputy chief minister in 2019 for a stint that lasted just 4 days.In 2019, when the undivided Shiv Sena of Uddhav Thackeray parted ways with the BJP over the chief minister's post, Ajit Pawar rebelled against his uncle Sharad Pawar and joined hands with BJP's Devendra Fadnavis to form a government in an early-morning operation that caught everyone by surprise. However, the government lasted for only 4 days as Ajit Pawar failed to muster the support of NCP MLAs.Also read: Fadnavis joins list of CMs who lasted a week or less On Wednesday, when the Mahayuti leaders met Maharashtra governor CP Radhakrishnan, the spotlight was on Shinde who had been upset over being denied a second term as Mahayuti chief minister and had still not cleared the air on assuming the role of deputy chief minister under CM-elect Fadnavis.When reporters asked Shinde if he would take oath as deputy chief minister along with Ajit Pawar in Mahayuti 2.0, the Shiv Sena chief said ""Wait till evening ... .""However, Ajit Pawar, who was sitting next to Shinde, interjected to say that he was definetely taking oath tomorrow along with Fadnavis. ""Sham tak unka samajh aayega (We will know about Shinde by evening), I will take it (oath), I will not wait,"" Ajit Pawar said.Ajit Pawar's readiness to take oath as deputy CM evoked an instant response from Shinde, who responded with a cheeky dig: ""Dada (Ajit Pawar) has experience of taking (oath) both in the morning and evening."" While this evoked laughter all around, it did remind everyone of Ajit Pawar's failed rebellion against Sharad Pawar in 2019.Shinde then was part of undivided Shiv Sena under Uddhav Thackeray - who had plunged the NDA into crisis by refusing to back Devendra Fadnavis as chief minister after their alliance had won a comfortable majority in the assembly.While Shiv Sena and BJP shared a great rapport in Mahayuti 1.0, Shinde's insistence on second term as Mahayuti chief minister after the 2024 assembly election results tested their bonhomie. In the last 11 days, when Shiv Sena made repeated claims for the top post, Ajit Pawar played his cards well and backed the BJP and Devendra Fadnavis to the hilt. While hectic negotiations were on, a Shiv Sena leader admitted that Ajit Pawar's NCP had reduced their bargaining power vis-à-vis the BJP. Little wonder, Eknath Shinde's remarks at Ajit Pawar may well be more than a light-hearted banter between allies.",Ajit Pawar rebelled against his uncle Sharad Pawar and joined hands with BJP's Devendra Fadnavis to form a government in an early-morning operation.

Devendra Fadnavis' invitation card for CM oath ceremony has special gift for his mother,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/devendra-fadnavis-invitation-card-for-cm-oath-ceremony-has-special-gift-for-his-mother/articleshow/115970707.cms,"Maharashtra govt formation: What’s in a name? Devendra Fadnavis adds his mother’s name to CM swearing-in invite

NEW DELHI: As Devendra Fadnavis prepares to take the oath as Maharashtra’s chief minister for the third time, a detail on the official invitation has sparked curiosity. The invite for the swearing-in ceremony, issued by chief secretary Sujata Saunik, refers to him as ""Devendra Sarita Gangadharrao Fadnavis,"" incorporating his mother Sarita’s name—a first in his political career.While it is customary for Maharashtra residents to use their father’s name as their middle name, this addition is a departure from tradition. Fadnavis had used only ""Gangadhar"" as his middle name during his previous swearing-in ceremonies in 2014 and 2019, as well as in his affidavit for the recent Assembly elections. The move has been interpreted as a personal homage to his mother, who has been a staunch supporter of his political journey.Sarita Fadnavis , who often shies away from the limelight, expressed pride in her son’s achievements after the BJP’s victory in the state elections. ""Everyone in the party wants him to be chief minister again. Even Prime Minister Narendra Modi regards him as a son,"" she said.The invitation detail adds a layer of personal significance to an otherwise political event. Preparations for the swearing-in at Mumbai’s Azad Maidan are in their final stages, with invitations extended to top political figures and dignitaries.Born into a Brahmin family, Fadnavis faced personal loss early in life when his father, Gangadhar Fadnavis—a Jan Sangh and BJP leader—passed away during his teens. Despite these challenges, Fadnavis carved his path in politics, becoming one of the youngest leaders to hold the chief minister’s post in Maharashtra.His wife, Amruta Fadnavis, a banker and social activist, and their daughter Divija are expected to attend the grand event.","Devendra Fadnavis will be sworn in as Maharashtra's chief minister for the third time.

Arvind Kejriwal calls Badal assassination attempt a 'big conspiracy'; BJP slams AAP over law and order in Punjab,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kejriwal-calls-badal-assassination-attempt-a-big-conspiracy-bjp-slams-aap-over-law-and-order/articleshow/115972484.cms,"BJP criticises AAP on Punjab's law and order



Delhi की जनता से जुड़े बेहद महत्वपूर्ण मुद्दों पर delhi assembly में संबोधन। LIVE

NEW DELHI: Former Delhi chief minister and AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday condemned the assassination attempt on Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) President Sukhbir Singh Badal , calling it a ""big conspiracy"" to defame Punjab and Punjabis. He praised the Punjab Police for their vigilance in preventing a major incident and criticised the BJP government for lawlessness in Delhi and other BJP-ruled states.Kejriwal addressing the Delhi assembly said, ""Today an incident happened in Punjab, someone tried to shoot at former Deputy CM Sukhbir Badal but due to the alertness of Punjab Police, a big accident was averted. Sukhbir Badal is safe. I condemn this incident. But one thing is clear that a big conspiracy is being hatched to ruin and defame Punjab and Punjabis and behind this many big forces are involved.""He contrasted the Punjab Police's vigilance with the situation in BJP-ruled Delhi, saying, ""Murders are taking place openly in Delhi, shootouts are taking place openly, the entire capital is in the control of gangsters, drugs are being sold everywhere, women are being raped, the entire BJP becomes silent, and their top leaders say that crime is not an issue, law and order is not an issue in Delhi.""Read also: Sukhbir Singh assassination bid: How alert 'sewadar' saved life of SAD leader at Golden Temple The attack occurred at the Golden Temple in Amritsar, where Badal was performing 'sewadar' duties as part of atonement for ""mistakes"" during SAD's tenure from 2007 to 2017. The assailant, identified as Narain Singh Chaura, fired a shot that missed Badal after being deflected by a bystander. Chaura, reportedly a former militant with a criminal history, was overpowered on the spot and arrested.BJP National Secretary Manjinder Singh Sirsa condemned the attack, terming it a ""grave breach of security and sanctity"" of Sri Harmandir Sahib. He held the AAP government responsible for the deteriorating law and order situation in Punjab.Sirsa stated on social media, ""Shocking and condemnable! An attack on S. Sukhbir Singh Badal in the sacred premises of Sri Harmandir Sahib is not just a security lapse but a grave breach of the sanctity of our religious institutions. AAP Govt has failed to ensure the safety of citizens and uphold the dignity of holy places.""He further criticised AAP leaders, saying, ""Ever since Aam Aadmi Party has come to Punjab, there is no law and order. Gangsters are ruling from jail... Punjab is being run from jail. Today, the law and order situation has deteriorated, and security has deteriorated in Punjab to such an extent that even a single person is not safe.""The assassination attempt has sparked a fresh political controversy, with both AAP and BJP trading barbs over governance and law enforcement in Punjab and Delhi. Authorities are investigating the motive behind the attack and Chaura's links to militant activities.Meanwhile, over attack on Sukhbir Singh Badal, SAD leader Bikram Singh Majithia condemned the law and order situation in Punjab and said, ""The situation is out of control. If the police had caught the man (accused shooter Narain Singh Chaura) two days ago, then I would have said that the situation was under control...A high court-monitored probe is required in this incident...If the Police knew that this man was roaming there, then were the Police waiting for him to shoot?...""""Narain Singh Chaura, a man against whom at least 30 cases are registered and was roaming there for last 3 days. AAP government says that Police are deployed there. Was the Police sleeping? I have shared videos of the man (accused shooter) conducted recee both today and yesterday. He came close to Sukhbir ji many times. If no one is safe in Golden Temple, then you can imagine what is the law & order situation in Punjab. This is the Punjab where Lawrence Bishnoi was interviewed in jail. This govt also gave protection to those guilty of Sidhu Moosewala killing...Narain Singh Chaura is son of Channan Singh Chaura. Channan Singh's second son is Narender Singh Bajwa who is the right-hand man of Sukhi Randhawa...Whenever there is a Congress govt Narain Chaura comes out...I have shared what connection this family has with Congress,"" Majithia added.Additionally, former Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi also criticised the Punjab goverment and said, ""This is condemnable, this incident should not have happened... This is the failure of the current Punjab government, their immaturity is visible. It has become clear that they are not able to run the administration properly. Such incidents keep happening in Punjab often, but because it happened with Sukhbir Singh Badal, now people are getting to know about it. People are being extorted in cities and villages, money is being collected by threatening them. There is no law and order in the state. The administrative qualities that a leader should have are not there in our Chief Minister. Another direct reason for this attack on Sukhbir Singh Badal is that people have anger and resentment against him which has now come to the fore.""","Former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal condemned the assassination attempt on Sukhbir Singh Badal. He praised the Punjab Police for their vigilance in preventing a major incident. He criticised the BJP government for lawlessness in Delhi and other BJP-ruled states.

Speaking to the media last Sunday, he had said he was open to prohibiting beef consumption in Assam if the Congress submitted a written request.

""Wait till evening,"" he said, only for Ajit to interject, ""He may decide by evening, but I am going to take oath (as dy CM)."" While Ajit's comment drew laughter, Shinde said, ""Ajit dada has experience. He can take oath in evening as well as in the morning,"" referring to the NCP chief's early-morning oath-taking as Fadnavis's deputy when BJP and an NCP faction led by him formed a short-lived govt in 2019.

NEW DELHI: Travelling in a night bus in the dacoit-infested Banda district of Uttar Pradesh nearly four decades ago, a station officer of UP police single-handedly fought a gang of armed dacoits which had waylaid the vehicle.When the dacoits fired at him, Ram Yadav whipped out his service revolver and fired at the gang, killing their ringleader. Unnerved by this, the dacoits fled.While the incident happened on March 10, 1986, the Banda SP on Aug 3, 1989, recommended Yadav's name for the President's gallantry medal. Yadav eagerly waited the recognition, but it never came. With passage of time, govt appeared to have forgotten about it but Yadav kept writing to his seniors.Decades later, on inquiring with the department concerned, Yadav learnt that the file containing the SP's 1989 recommendation had been lost. He then filed a writ petition before Allahabad HC, but court dismissed it saying it was barred by limitation as almost four decades had passed. He then moved SC.A bench of Justices Surya Kant, Dipankar Datta and Ujjal Bhuyan subsequently sought response from UP govt and also appointed senior advocate Rana Mukherjee as amicus curiae for a dignified resolution.On Wednesday, UP govt counsel Ruchira Goel informed the bench that the DGP after due verification of Yadav's documents had agreed to grant a commendation certificate to him.The bench said Yadav was honest enough to inform SC that he just wanted recognition of his bravery and not money. But the bench felt Yadav should be rewarded for his bravery that went unrecognised for 38 years, and using its discretionary powers, SC directed the state govt to give Yadav an honorarium of Rs 5 lakh.","Ram Yadav fought a gang of armed dacoits which had waylaid the vehicle.

NEW DELHI: The Maha political drama over the chief minister's post in Maharashtra's Mahayuti finally ended today with Eknath Shinde proposing the name of BJP's Devendra Fadnavis as the next leader of the ruling coalition. However, it is still not clear if Shinde will join the government as deputy chief minister.It took Shinde 11 days to finally agree to a change of leadership after BJP rejected his demand for a second term as chief minister of the Mahayuti.Here's how the drama unfolded after Maharashtra results were announced on November 23.The people of Maharashtra gave an overwhelming majority to the ruling Mahayuti with the ruling coalition winning 230 seats in the 288-member assembly. The BJP achieved remarkable success securing 132 seats on its own, just 13 less than simple majority. Allies Shiv Sena and NCP also performed exceptionally well winning 57 and 41 seats respectively.Immediately after the verdict, chief minister Eknath Shinde attributed the huge electoral success to his government's performance in the last two and a half years. Shinde claimed that the welfare programmes announced by his government, including the Ladki Bahin scheme, were the gamechangers in the elections. Shiv Sena then started its push for second term to Shinde citing his popularity and governance model.The Shiv Sena leaders started an orchestrated campaign for Shinde as chief minister. The party claimed that the BJP had promised to give the top post to Shinde if the Mahayuti won the elections. They put up posters demanding Shinde as leader of Mahayuti and also tweaked PM Modi's ""Ek hain to safe hain"" slogan to claim ""Ek(nath) hain to safe hain."" Some Sena leaders pitched for Shinde citing the Bihar model where BJP's junior partner Nitish Kumar is the chief minister of the state.After four days of silence, Shinde finally addressed a press conference to announce that he will not be an obstacle in the formation of new government and will accept the decision of Prime Minister Modi and Amit Shah on Mahayuti's chief minister pick. However, he also used the presser to list the achievements of his government and announced that the work done by his government in two and a half years was more than what other governments would do in 10 years. He also called his tenure historic. Shinde also played the victim card and claimed that for him CM meant common man and not chief minister. The Shiv Sena chief cited his humble origins to claim how he as chief minister understood the pains of common man.A day after Shinde's climbdown on CM post, the Mahayuti leaders finally met Union home minister Amit Shah and BJP chief J P Nadda in the national capital on November 28 to discuss the modalities of forming the new government. However, the meeting could not finalise the power sharing agreement and Shinde, Fadavis and Ajit Pawar decided to meet again on November 29 in Mumbai.However, this scheduled meeting of the three Mahayuti leaders in Mumbai could not take place as Shinde suddenly left Mumbai for his native village in Satara. The Shiv Sena leaders added to the suspense as they gave different reasons for Shinde's sudden absence from Mumbai. While one leader claimed he was unwell and hence had gone to village to take rest, another Sena leader claimed that Shinde was planning a big decision and hence had gone to his native village.With Shinde still sulking, the BJP decided to take control and unilaterally announced December 5 as the date for the swearing in of the Mahayuti 2.0 government. The Maharashtra BJP chief announced the date sending out a clear message to Shinde.A day after BJP's surprise move, Shinde announced that a meeting of Mahayuti leaders will be held in Mumbai on December 1. Shinde also returned from Satara to Mumbai signalling truce.However, the proposed Mahayuti leaders's meeting had to be cancelled again due to the unavailability of caretaker chief minister Shinde, who decided to go to his Thane residence as per doctor's advice for rest.The BJP, however, went ahead with its preparations for the swearing in ceremony. It appointed Nirmala Sitharaman and Vijay Rupani as party's central observers for BJP legislature party meeting on December 4.Shinde finally returned to Mumbai on December 3 after visiting a hospital in Thane for medical tests. He held a meeting with concerned officials to take stock of the preparations for the event to be held at Chaityabhoomi on the death anniversary of Dr BR Ambedkar on December 6. Following this meeting, Fadnavis went to CM house to meet Shinde.At the legislature party meeting held in Vidhan Bhawan earlier in the day, former Gujarat CM and BJP's central observer Vijay Rupani announced that Fadnavis has been unanimously elected the BJP legislature party leader.Later, Fadnavis alongwith Shinde and Ajit Pawar, met with state Governor CP Radhakrishnan to formally stake claim to form the government, presenting letters of support from coalition partners, including the Shiv Sena and the NCP.However, there is still no clarity if Shinde will join the government.(With inputs from agencies)",Eknath Shinde proposes Devendra Fadnavis as the next leader of the ruling coalition. It is still not clear if Shindes will join the government as deputy chief minister. It took 11 days to finally agree to a change of leadership after BJP rejected his demand for a second term.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115981377,imgsize-1470059,width-400,resizemode-4/115981377.jpg"

CHENNAI: Congress MP Karti Chidambaram on Wednesday wrote to the National Incharge of the Indian Youth Congress (IYC), raising concerns over the membership drive in Tamil Nadu.In his letter to Krishna Allavaru, Karti Chidambaram described the current online membership registration process as misleading.""I must emphasise that this 'drive' is nothing short of a ghost or phantom operation. Consider the facts: In 2010, TNYC claimed to have 13,32,912 members. Fast forward to 2021, and the IYC claims to have registered over eight lakh members. Startlingly, the total popular votes secured by the INC in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections in Tamil Nadu were only 17,50,990. This demonstrates that these membership numbers are deceptive and illusory,"" he stated.""If these online members were genuinely engaged, where was their involvement when it mattered most--at the polls?"" he questioned.The Congress MP also alleged that the IYC membership fees are not paid by individuals but by regional satraps, power brokers, and affluent individuals who manipulate the election process to their advantage.""This undermines those who have invested years of effort, sidelining them and demoralising the party's unity while discouraging genuine participation,"" Chidambaram added.He further highlighted the lack of a robust verification process for online members. ""What's to stop anyone from signing up without genuine commitment to the party's values? How can we expect these so-called members to contribute to party activities if they aren't even committed to the cause in the first place? The sad reality is that only a fraction of these 'members' remain active post-election. This is a waste of resources and a betrayal of the party's integrity,"" he remarked.Karti Chidambaram criticised the current online enrolment system as a failure, asserting that it risks further alienation and disillusionment within the party.""I urge a complete overhaul of the system--one that prioritises real, physical enrolment, where individuals demonstrate their commitment to the party's principles and are willing to contribute to its growth. Only those who prove their dedication should be granted the right to vote in internal elections. This will ensure that leadership decisions are made by individuals with a genuine stake in the party's future, not by a faceless mass of online members with no true allegiance,"" the Congress MP concluded.","Congress MP Karti Chidambaram raises questions on Tamil Nadu Youth Congress membership drive.

Even as it is a bilateral issue with Bangladesh and the state government is on the same page as that of the Centre on the Bangladesh issue, it is important to take Mamata Banerjee on board in the matter just as it was done for the Teesta water or Land-Border Agreement between the two countries,” since Bengal is a stakeholder on any issue with Bangladesh.In Lok Sabha, at BJP members expressed their concern and sought the intervention of PM Modi in the release of Iskcon monk Chinmoy Krishna Das, who has been jailed in Bangladesh on charges of sedition.Ujjain MP Anil Firojiya raised the issue during Zero Hour and said no lawyers were available in Bangladesh and one who was ready to represent him was battling for life (since he was attacked).BJP member from Mathura, Hema Malini, said that insult to religion, violence and injustice cannot be tolerated.

NEW DELHI: With Opposition members holding protests at the entry gate of Parliament House for a couple of days, during the ongoing Winter Session , Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla on Wednesday urged MPs not to create hindrances as it obstructs those entering the building.Since Mahatma Gandhi’s Statue at the Parliament premises -- where members would gather to protest on issues outside of the Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha chambers – was shifted out from its prominent place in front of the Parliament building, to a forlorn corner behind the old Parliament House, Opposition MPs have been protesting at the entry gate (Makar Dwar) of the new Parliament House, during sessions.Birla’s appeal came a day after the Lok Sabha secretariat urged MPs not to hold protests in front of the gates of Parliament House, contending that obstruction of movement could affect their safety and security. ""I request all political parties not to obstruct the entry gate when others are entering the building.""Women MPs have personally flagged their difficulty. I have already given direction and I request once again that if there is an issue, meet me but there should be no obstruction at the entry gate,"" Birla said ahead of Zero Hour. He said members should follow parliamentary decorum.Some opposition MPs were heard saying that the ruling BJP had started the practice of protest at the gate, while others were heard asking the Speaker to reinstate the Gandhi statue at its earlier space.The secretariat's advisory on Tuesday came on a day parliamentarians held protests on the steps of Makar Dwar, which is used by members and of the officials. ""Members are requested not to hold protests or demonstrations in front of gates of Parliament House as such actions cause serious hindrance to the movement of members to the Parliament Chambers during sittings of the Houses,"" the advisory said.

Only Maha CM, 2 dy CMs set to take oath tomorrow

In a breakthrough in power-sharing talks between BJP and Shiv Sena Eknath Shinde has agreed to join the new Mahayuti govt and will likely be one of two deputy CMs to be sworn in on Thursday in a govt that could be led by BJP's Devendra Fadnavis , a Sena neta close to Shinde said after Fadnavis met the caretaker CM at his official Varsha residence on Tuesday evening.The face-to-face interaction between Fadnavis and Shinde took place six days after they were in New Delhi for a meeting with Union home minister Amit Shah. Sources said Fadnavis visited the CM's official residence to convince Shinde to join the govt.Sena sources said BJP's central observers, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and former Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani, will meet Shinde after the election of BJP's legislature party leader on Wednesday. The final power-sharing formula will be discussed in their presence. The CM-designate and the two deputy CMs (other being Ajit Pawar ) will also meet the governor.The CM-designate and the two deputy CMs (the other being Ajit Pawar) will also meet the governor CP Radhakrishnan on Wednesday and stake claim to form govt. A Sena functionary said only the CM and two deputy CMs are likely to take oath on Thursday and a wider cabinet will come in only once the final power-sharing formula is decided. ""So far, no decision has been taken on portfolios, including the home portfolio (which Shinde has been demanding).

Shinde had said the power-sharing formula (barring the CM's post) would be decided in a meeting of the three Mahayuti netas. However, Fadnavis's meeting is seen as all-important as it came just a day before election of BJP's legislative party functionary and the swearing-in of the Mahayuti govt on Thursday. The meeting lasted around 45 minutes.Earlier in the day, BJP's Girish Mahajan met Shinde and Sena's Uday Samant met Fadnavis at the latter's Sagar residence. Samant took a dig at BJP, saying the Sena learnt about the Dec 5 swearing-in of the Mahayuti govt from the state BJP chief Chandrashekhar Bawankule's post on X. Sena's Gulabrao Patil too reiterated his party wanted Shinde to become CM at least till the local body polls or to get the DCM's post with the home portfolio.On Tuesday afternoon, Shinde drove to Jupiter Hospital in Thane for medical tests. ""He has been complaining of fever and throat infection and was being treated at home for the last two days by a physician from the hospital. He decided to undergo a few tests, including a CT scan, on Tuesday, following which he was driven to Jupiter Hospital,"" a close relative told TOI.

According to the cabinet brief, the decision is meant to strengthen the Assam Cattle Preservation Act , 2021.The legislation bans sale or purchase of cattle within a 5km radius of any Hindu temple or Vaishnavite satra (monastery), and in areas predominantly inhabited by Hindus, Jains, Sikhs and other communities. The law also bars transportation of cattle within the state without a permit.""We realised that our cattle preservation law did not have a provision barring consumption of beef at community gatherings, and in hotels and restaurants. The cabinet decision will be incorporated into the legislation,"" CM said.Without mentioning the new order, Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi on X said that Sarma was resorting to diversionary tactics.
