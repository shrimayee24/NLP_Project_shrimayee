Nitish Kumar's Hijab Shocker: BJP MP Giriraj Singh Defends Bihar CM's Act With 'Go To Hell' Remark

NEW DELHI: AIMIM leader Imtiaz Jaleel on Friday said he would ""cut off the hand of any individual who dares to touch Muslim women with ill intent,"" amid controversy over Bihar CM Nitish Kumar’s action of pulling down a hijab from a woman’s face.Addressing a rally in Maharashtra, Jaleel also took a veiled jibe at BJP , alleging that ""so-called secular parties"" often support goons and criminal elements but hesitate to stand with Muslims.""A minister from Uttar Pradesh had made an objectionable remark. If anyone dares to touch a Muslim sister with ill intent, I will cut his hand,"" the former Aurangabad MP said, referring to a comment by UP minister Sanjay Nishad on the hijab row involving Nitish Kumar.Nishad had said, ""What would have happened if he touched her somewhere else?"" and later clarified that his comment was twisted and misinterpreted.Campaigning for 17 AIMIM candidates in the upcoming January 15 municipal corporation elections, Jaleel accused other parties of branding AIMIM as communal while failing to support Muslims.""Secular parties often brand AIMIM as a communal and untouchable party, whereas in reality, they themselves are the most communal and do not want Muslims to emerge as leaders.They have no hesitation in favouring goons and criminal elements, but they hesitate to stand with Muslims or give proper representation to the Muslim community,"" he alleged, as quoted by PTI.Jaleel also mocked Maharashtra Social Justice Minister and Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Shirsat’s demand to freeze AIMIM’s ‘kite’ election symbol, citing the coincidence of the civic polls with the Makar Sankranti festival. In a lighter remark, he urged Shiv Sena and BJP leaders not to wear ""watches"" for the next month, targeting the 'Clock' symbol of their Mahayuti ally, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP).","AIMIM leader Imtiaz Jaleel said he would ""cut off the hand of any individual who dares to touch Muslim women with ill intent"" He also took a veiled jibe at BJP, alleging that ""so-called secular parties"" often support goons and criminal elements but hesitate to stand with Muslims.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126321642,imgsize-665517,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-19.jpg"

However, the meeting did not take place. “Such a meeting was not scheduled. Also, the public meeting attended by Shah in Pudukottai was a BJP event, not an NDA event. Hence, allies were not invited,” a BJP member said.Former AIADMK minister S P Velumani met Shah twice. Union commerce minister Piyush Goyal, who is BJP Tamil Nadu poll in-charge, was present during the first interaction. However, both AIADMK and BJP functionaries remained tight-lipped about the talks.Meanwhile, BJP sources said Shah may visit Chennai again later this month, when he could meet EPS.Shah also chaired a BJP core committee meeting on Sunday. On Monday, Shah visited Jambukeswarar temple in Thiruvanaikoil and Ranganathaswamy temple in Srirangam. He later reached Trichy-Madurai NH, where BJP organised ‘Namma Ooru Modi Pongal Vizha’, a traditional Pongal celebration featuring 1,008 pots. While party cadres expected Shah to address the gathering, he spent less than 30 minutes at the venue.","There was anticipation that Shah would initiate alliance talks with potential partners, PMK and DMDK.

Amid the opposition's charge that the names of PDA (Pichhda, Dalit and Alpsankhyak) community members were ""removed"" from the rolls, Yogi said a majority of the deleted names were primarily BJP supporters. The draft roll will be published on Tuesday.The meeting also assumed significance against the backdrop of the much-anticipated reshuffle in state cabinet.Yogi later called on Amit Shah, J P Nadda, and Nitin Nabin, who is expected to formally take over as BJP chief.","Yogi Adityanath meets PM Modi, JP Nadda and Amit Shah in New Delhi.

MUMBAI: For the first time in the history of BMC general elections, candidates were asked to do more than just file their nomination forms and affidavits. All 2,516 aspirants who submitted nomination papers were required to write an essay - the instructions were to keep it between 100 and 500 words - spelling out how they planned to develop their local areas if elected.""The provision was introduced in 2018 and has since been used in bypolls, but never before in a general civic election of this scale,"" said State Election Commission secretary Suresh Kakani.Officials said there were speaking orders issued by returning officers to reject nomination forms during scrutiny if an aspirant did not fill the essay column.The move left candidates sharply divided. While some welcomed the requirement as a chance to articulate their agenda, others dismissed it as unnecessary, even impractical. ""As a former corporator, I already have a clear roadmap and several pending work I want to complete once I am elected,"" BJP candidate Vinod Mishra from Malad (E) said, adding he had no trouble putting his plans on paper.Others were far less impressed. Former Congress corporator Sheetal Mhatre, who lost the 2017 election and is back in the fray, said, ""Candidates anyway distribute pamphlets or booklets house-to-house, detailing their work and promises. I don't see the point of writing another essay."" Congress MLA Aslam Shaikh, a former corporator, who has family members contesting the polls, said the real scrutiny happened elsewhere. ""Today, housing societies and local groups are grilling candidates on multiple issues. An essay in the nomination form doesn't add much.""","For the first time in the history of BMC general elections, candidates were asked to do more than just file nomination forms.

'Batenge Toh Katenge': Uddhav & Raj Thackeray Unite For Mumbai Civic Polls | Shiv Sena (UBT) | MNS







MUMBAI: Deputy CM Eknath Shinde's Shiv Sena will take on Uddhav and Raj Thackeray's parties on 87 seats in the BMC polls.The recent electoral record favours Sena (UBT). In the 2024 Lok Sabha election, of the 13 constituencies that saw a Sena vs Sena battle, UBT won seven, while Shinde's party won six. In Mumbai, UBT won three of the four seats it contested, while Sena won one of three.""The Lok Sabha and assembly elections indicated which Sena holds greater clout in Mumbai. But the BMC polls are far more intense and will decisively establish which is the real Sena,"" said a political observer. ""With the Thackeray cousins fighting together this time, it is also a referendum on the Thackeray brand. Whether the Marathi voter responds to the renewed 'Marathi Manoos' narrative will be crucial. This is, in many ways, the final battle between the two Senas. It will shape Mumbai's political future and also the political trajectories of the Thackerays.""During the LS and assembly polls, several UBT leaders from Mumbai who defected to Shinde, including MLAs Yamini Jadhav and Sada Sarvankar, and MP Rahul Shewale, lost in direct Sena vs Sena contests. Over 40 former UBT corporators have since joined Shinde. ""How they perform against the combined strength of the Thackerays will be closely watched,"" the observer said.""The outcome will largely depend on the Marathi vote. A poor showing by Shinde could also hurt BJP by disrupting Marathi vote transfer and weaken Mahayuti.""Key Shinde vs Thackeray face-offs are expected in Sewri, Worli, Dadar-Mahim, Wadala, Bhandup, Vikhroli, Ghatkopar (West), Magathane, Dindoshi, Dahisar, Bandra (East) and Kalina.","Eknath Shinde's Shiv Sena will take on Uddhav and Raj Thackeray's parties on 87 seats in the BMC polls.

ULHASNAGAR: As campaigning intensifies for the Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation elections, the BJP and Shiv Sena are contesting separately in the city, adding to the political heat. Recently, former BJP MLA Narendra Pawar triggered a debate by taking a swipe at Shiv Sena, claiming that the “dadagiri of the bow-and-arrow symbol will not work in Ulhasnagar.” Referring to the Ambernath and Badlapur municipal council elections, Pawar said such dominance had already been defeated there and would meet the same fate in Ulhasnagar.Responding to the remark, Shiv Sena MP from the Kalyan Lok Sabha constituency, Shrikant Shinde, addressed the issue during the inauguration of offices of Shiv Sena candidates and workers in Ulhasnagar.Shinde while naming Pawar advised leaders of the Mahayuti to maintain restraint and avoid public statements against alliance partners.Shinde stated that the Shiv Sena and the BJP are contesting together in several municipal corporations, while in some places they are fighting elections independently.He recalled that in the recently concluded municipal council elections across Maharashtra, alliance partners contested separately at many locations but avoided verbal attacks on each other and still achieved strong electoral results.He stressed that a similar approach should be followed during the ongoing municipal corporation elections.During the same visit, Srikanth Shinde, along with District Chief Gopal Landge, TOK Chief Omie Kalani and MLA Balaji Kinikar, met Shiv Sena candidates across the city and reviewed the status of election campaigning.Shinde informed party workers that in Ulhasnagar, the Shiv Sena, TOK, SAI p and RPI are contesting the elections together. He said the atmosphere across all panels is positive and favourable for the alliance.Highlighting development works carried out in the city, Shinde pointed to the construction of cement concrete roads, underground drainage pipelines, no-cash counter hospitals, and the ongoing work on a sports stadium. He said these development initiatives have been widely appreciated by citizens and expressed confidence that voters, taking into account the work done by Shiv Sena and its allies, will ensure a decisive victory for the alliance candidates in the upcoming elections.",Former BJP MLA Narendra Pawar triggered a debate by taking a swipe at Shiv Sena.
