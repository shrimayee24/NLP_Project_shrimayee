""I have no family..."" Rohini Acharya Cuts Ties With Lalu Clan, Exits Politics Post-RJD Defeat

NEW DELHI: Central Bureau of Investigation ( CBI ) on Saturday opposed former Bihar Chief Minister Rabri Devi’s request to transfer criminal cases from the court of Special Judge Vishal Gogne, arguing before a Delhi court that the plea amounted to “forum-shopping” and was meant to “demean the judge” and interfere with the justice system.Appearing before Principal District and Sessions Judge Dinesh Bhatt, Senior Advocate DP Singh, representing the CBI, said the transfer application made unfounded allegations against the judiciary and was an attempt to pressure the trial court. He maintained that an accused has no right to seek a change of forum merely because the case is not proceeding in their favour.“You cannot bulldoze a court. You cannot go forum shopping. You cannot demean a judge,” Singh told the court, stressing that such conduct strikes at the independence and dignity of the judicial process.The CBI counsel submitted that Special Judge Gogne had acted strictly in accordance with procedures laid down by higher courts and established judicial practice. He argued that the transfer plea was filed with the intention of stalling the trial at a critical stage.Addressing Rabri Devi’s allegation that Judge Gogne had intentionally delayed the order on framing of charges in the IRCTC corruption case to align with the enforcement of the Model Code of Conduct for the Bihar elections, Singh rejected the claim as baseless.He explained that the court had merely sought clarifications from the investigating agency, which was part of its judicial duty.“These clarifications were sought for the court’s clarity and conscience. It is the duty of the judge to ask questions,” Singh submitted.Judge Bhatt heard the submissions in detail and scheduled the matter for further hearing on December 15, 2025.In her application, Rabri Devi sought the transfer of four cases pending before Judge Gogne, in which she and several members of her family are named as accused. The cases include the IRCTC scam, the alleged land-for-jobs case, and related money-laundering proceedings.Earlier, on October 13, Judge Gogne framed criminal charges against RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav , Rabri Devi, Tejashwi Yadav, and others in the IRCTC case.Rabri Devi alleged in her plea that the special judge is biased and conducting the trials with a premeditated mindset. She has claimed that he is “unduly inclined” towards the prosecution, creating a reasonable apprehension of bias. The CBI has rejected these allegations, describing them as an effort to scandalise the court and delay the trial.","Rabri Devi seeks transfer of four cases pending before Special Judge Vishal Gogne.

'We Are United...Will Go To Delhi If High Command Calls': Siddaramaiah, Shivakumar After Meeting

BENGALURU: Karnataka deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar met with over 30 Congress legislators and ministers for a dinner meeting late Thursday night in Belagavi, amid ongoing speculations about potential leadership changes in the state government.According to news agency PTI sources, dinner gathering included prominent ministers K H Muniyappa, Mankal Vaidya, Dr M C Sudhakar, and several MLAs including N A Haris, Ramesh Bandisiddegowda, H C Balakrishna, Ganesh Hukkeri, Darshan Dhruvanarayana, Ashok Kumar Rai, and K Y Nanjegowda.Expelled BJP MLAs ST Somashekhar and Shivaram Hebbar were also present.This meeting followed a separate dinner hosted by former Belagavi North MLA Feroz Sait the previous day, which was attended by Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and his close associates.While party leaders describe these as casual dinner meetings, they have attracted attention due to the ongoing power dynamics within the ruling party regarding the chief minister position.The timing of these gatherings is significant as they occurred after speculation about a possible change in chief minister when the Congress government completed its half-term on November 20, 2023.The party high command had recently instructed both Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar to meet over breakfast at each other's residences.This move was seen as an attempt to pause the leadership tussle between the two leaders.These breakfast meetings were also interpreted as a signal for Siddaramaiah's continuation as chief minister for the immediate future, particularly before the Belagavi legislature session.The recent developments follow rumors about a possible power-sharing agreement between Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar after Congress won the Assembly election in 2023."," DK Shivakumar met with over 30 Congress legislators and ministers for a dinner meeting late Thursday night in Belagavi.
