Can state police arrest central agency staff? SC says issue double-edged,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/accused-has-no-say-on-probe-but-has-right-to-a-fair-one-supreme-court-on-alleged-corruption-case/articleshow/115824897.cms,"Accused has no say on probe, but has right to a fair one: SC

NEW DELHI: In a significant response to growing cases of arrests of officers of central probe agencies by state police, Supreme Court Friday pitched for balance between competing objectives of protecting the Centre's functionaries from vengeful actions which could trigger a constitutional crisis, while not restraining state police from probing allegations of corruption.A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Ujjal Bhuyan found themselves addressing the conflictual question while hearing a case related to the arrest of an ED officer by Tamil Nadu police for alleged corruption.Hearing a case related to the arrest of an ED officer by Tamil Nadu police for alleged corruption, a Supreme Court bench led by Justice Surya Kant said the moot question was if the officer was from central govt, should he be arrested by state police. If central govt had given permission to proceed against that officer, it was a different scenario altogether, it said.Additional advocate general for Tamil Nadu Amit Anand Tiwari told the bench, also comprising Justice Ujjal Bhuyan, that the ED officer was caught red-handed accepting Rs 20 lakh bribe and that investigation in the case under Prevention of Corruption Act was almost complete. ""State police were ready to file a chargesheet but waited because of ED approaching SC,"" Tiwari said.When the accused officer's counsel attempted to interject, Tiwari objected and said the accused could not have a say in the matter of investigation or which agency should investigate a crime. The bench said, ""The accused can have no say in the matter of investigation, but he has a right tofair investigation .""Referring to the conflicting issues involved in the case, the bench said, ""In a federal structure , each and every component should be allowed to retain its exclusive domains of jurisdiction. Take a hypothetical scenario - if a state police, out of vendetta, arrests central govt officials, it will create a constitutional crisis. So, to say that state will have exclusive power to arrest would be dangerous to the federal structure. But to deny state police its power to investigate a crime within its jurisdiction would be undesirable. We will deliberate and consider arguments from both sides to strike a balance between these two competing aspects of police power.""The bench further said, ""This is a classic case of state vs the Union and we will consider the larger federal structure scheme and determine the mechanism for investigation into such cases."" It extended the interim bail granted to the arrested ED officer till further orders.","A Supreme Court bench led by Justice Surya Kant said the moot question was if the officer was from central govt, should he be arrested by state police.

Atishi vows AAP won’t field candidate against BJP’s Vijender Gupta in Delhi elections—but on one condition,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/atishi-vows-aap-wont-field-candidate-against-bjps-vijender-gupta-in-delhi-electionsbut-on-one-condition-bus-marshal/articleshow/115812254.cms,"NEW DELHI: Delhi chief minister Atishi on Friday said that the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) would not field a candidate against BJP’s leader of opposition, Vijender Gupta , in the upcoming elections on the Rohini seat if Gupta could persuade lieutenant governor VK Saxena to approve the reinstatement of 10,000 bus marshals.Atishi went a step further, offering to personally campaign for Gupta should he successfully navigate the bureaucratic hurdles and secure approval from the LG.The comments came during a heated debate in the Delhi Assembly’s final session, where ruling AAP and opposition BJP lawmakers engaged in a blame game over the removal of bus marshals.Atishi defended her party’s stance, saying that the proposal to reinstate the marshals had been pending approval from the LG. She also responded to BJP accusations, which blamed former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal for the removal of the marshals starting in November 2023.Atishi clarified that Kejriwal had, in fact, opposed the removal, referencing a letter from October 2023, in which the CM instructed that the marshals should remain in service, and called for disciplinary action against officials who had withheld their salaries.She accused the LG of removing the marshals without regard for public safety, a decision she said was politically motivated and harmful to the welfare of the marshals and their families.BJP leaders in the assembly dismissed the AAP’s narrative, insisting that the removal of the marshals was carried out under Kejriwal’s direction, and now the AAP was merely playing politics with the issue of their reinstatement.Gupta sought answers from Atishi saying the AAP government deployed bus marshals and then removed them.BJP MLA Abhay Verma questioned the ruling party’s ability to resolve the issue, asking why the AAP government, in power for nearly a decade, had failed to bring back the marshals.Urban development minister Saurabh Bharadwaj, however, highlighted that the regularization of bus marshals fell under the jurisdiction of the LG, as it involved ""services"" and ""law and order"" matters, areas where the Delhi government has limited authority.","Delhi chief minister Atishi says Aam Aadmi Party would not field a candidate against BJP’s leader of opposition, Vijender Gupta.

HYDERABAD: After neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, Telangana govt is also set to junk the two-child norm for candidates of rural local body polls, reports Roushan Ali. A bill to amend the Telangana Panchayat Raj Act, 2018, to do away with the bar will be tabled in the forthcoming winter session of the assembly.Recently, the Andhra assembly passed a bill removing the two-child norm, with the govt stating it is being done in view of the changing socio-economic necessities and falling total fertility rate in the state.The southern states, which have performed well in controlling population, are upset that they are being penalized for their good work. Officials told Telangana CM Revanth Reddy that people have moved court complaining about the disparity between rural and urban local bodies. They contended that if candidates with more than two children could contest in urban body elections, why were candidates from rural areas being denied the same right. The court then asked the Telangana govt to take an appropriate decision.","Telangana govt is set to junk the two-child norm for candidates of rural local body polls.

NEW DELHI: In the wake of the Sambhal and Ajmer shrine disputes, CWC Friday resolved to proactively support Places of Worship Act , as it accused BJP for compromising the law as part of a strategy to keep polarisation simmering.Sources said Shashi Tharoor raised the Ajmer issue and argued that the law, which bars conversion of any religious place after Independence, was not brought by any political party, but passed unanimously by Parliament.CWC in the backdrop of electoral setbacks witnessed the leadership's disgust with infighting in state units. Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge singled out Haryana, where he said even the smallest appointment did not find a consensus among the factional netas. ""Lack of unity and bickering against colleagues hurts us the most.

NEW DELHI: Alleging that the Maharashtra elections were compromised, Congress Friday told EC there was an ""inexplicable"" rise in turnout in the last hour that added 76 lakh votes, and the governing BJP alliance manipulated the voters list resulting in an ""inexplicable"" increase of 47 lakh voters in the five months after Lok Sabha polls.It demanded an urgentin-person hearing with EC, while seeking a probe. It, interestingly, steered clear of any complaint against EVMs, just days after Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge sought a return to ballot papers.Claiming ""unchecked and arbitrary deletion and consequent insertion of voters"", Congress claimed that out of the 50 assembly seats with an average increase of 50,000 voters, the BJP alliance won 47.Talking about ""glaring discrepancies"" in turnout data, it said EC's provisional figure at 5pm was 58.2%, which rose to 65% at 11.30pm, an addition of 76 lakh votes, which then rose to 66%, that added another 10 lakh votes.Congress Working Committee, meanwhile, resolved to launch a national movement against the ""compromised electoral process"" and blamed institutional bias and electoral malpractices for the defeats in Maharashtra and Haryana. Sources said there were a couple of voices urging caution on attacking EVMs, even as they agreed on the issue of bias in EC.""CWC believes the integrity of the entire electoral process is being severely compromised. Free and fair elections is a constitutional mandate that is being called into serious question by the partisan functioning of EC... Congress will take up these public concerns as a national movement,"" a resolution said.Abhishek Singhvi is said to have argued that EVMs should be junked but suggested a graded approach - that till the system reaches a stage where voting machines can be replaced, there should be 100% matching of VVPATs or 10% VVPATS given in hand.According to sources, Ajay Maken, Rajiv Shukla and Gaurav Gogoi backed the approach but added it was about the larger issue about the ""bias"" of EC. Rahul Gandhi is said to have fleetingly mentioned EVMs while arguing that the problem was about EC's functioning.But counselling caution, Shashi Tharoor said that merely talking about EVMs may not find resonance with people, while Maken wondered how the party would contest polls if it expressed doubts about the machines.","Alleging that the Maharashtra elections were compromised, Congress Friday told EC there was an ""inexplicable"" rise in turnout in the last hour.

Eknath Shinde: BJP wants Shinde as deputy chief minister of Maharashtra to project message of unity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/bjp-wants-eknath-shinde-as-deputy-chief-minister-of-maharashtra-to-project-message-of-unity/articleshow/115789069.cms,"NEW DELHI: Mahayuti leaders Devendra Fadnavis Eknath Shinde and Ajit Pawar met with Union home minister Amit Shah late on Thursday here over the maharashtra govt formation. BJP is set on rehabilitating Fadnavis, something that would right the ‘wrong’ that was done to him when he was made to pay second fiddle for the party’s sake.But it is equally desirous of Shinde joining the team as deputy CM in order to project the message of unity.Although the S hiv Sena leader had said he would abide by the choice of PM Narendra Modi and Shah, BJP wants him to feel valued. “Besides, having him on its side will also help the party minimise its reliance on Ajit dada,” a source reasoned.While many argued that after serving as CM, becoming deputy CM may not be acceptable to Shinde, sources said this was not an issue in Maharashtra politics , and cited the example of Fadnavis as well as several others, including veterans. They also dismissed suggestions that having two Marathas as deputies may not go down well with voters, pointing out that the outgoing team also had two Marathas — Shinde and Ajit Pawar.“I cleared my stand in the press conference yesterday that there are no obstacles regarding CM of Mahayuti. This ‘ladla bhai’ has arrived in Delhi and the ‘ladla bhai’ is a designation higher than anything else for me. A meeting will be held on everything,” Shinde said, reiterating his position amid some of his party colleagues still staking a claim for the top post for their boss.There is recognition of the need to appoint a BJP CM given that the party bagged 132 seats in the 288-member House, and has also got the support of five more MLAs, leaving it just eight short of the majority mark on its own.As reported by TOI after the day election results were announced on Nov 23, Ajit Pawar has conveyed his support to Fadnavis, reducing the manoeuvring space for Shinde’s party. In any case, sources said the allies had jointly decided on seat allocation ahead of the polls and there was clear agreement on the issue.Amid speculation on the power-sharing formula in the Mahayuti, Shiv Sena MLA Sanjay Shirsat on Thursday said Shinde may not take up the deputy CM’s post. Shirsat said, according to him, Shinde will remain in Maharashtra politics but may not take up the dy CM’s post.“This will be a big thing. He may not take up dy CM’s post. This is my assessment. This offer can be given anytime (by BJP). They are ready, but I think Shinde may not take it up. He may take one portfolio and remain here, but I think he may not take up the dy CM’s post,” Shirsat said.","Mahayuti leaders Devendra Fadnavis Eknath Shinde and Ajit Pawar met with Union home minister Amit Shah late on Thursday here over the maharashtra govt formation.
