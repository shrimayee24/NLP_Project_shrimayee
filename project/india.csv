Minor tracked target's movement for 15 days

NEW DELHI: It was an almost decade-long vendetta that led to the murder of 56-year-old property dealer Lakhpat Singh Kataria in south Delhi's Malviya Nagar, police said on Sunday. A father-son duo has been nabbed for the crime after a 48-hour manhunt aided by CCTV analysis, technical surveillance and human intelligence, cops said.The man arrested for Kataria's murder has criminal antecedents, special commissioner (law and order) Ravindra Yadav said. He had filed an FIR against Kataria in 2016 following a brawl that he claimed left him bedridden for nine months. The son was just nine at the time. They nurtured the grudge for nine long years and finally attacked Kataria last week.The suspect, 47, roped in his 17-year-old son for the murder, deliberately timing the act a day before the boy's 18th birthday so that he could benefit from juvenile laws.On the day of incident, the father-son duo first attacked the victim with a cricket bat and fired multiple shots at him inside Vijay Mandal Park, Malviya Nagar. Singh was declared brought dead at AIIMS.At the crime scene, cops found bloodstains scattered across the park, along with a broken cricket bat handle and the bat itself. A case under Sections 103 (murder) and 3(5) (common intention) of BNS)and Sections 25/27 of the Arms Act was registered at Malviya Nagar police station.Deputy commissioner of police (South) Ankit Chauhan said, ""Around 650 CCTV cameras across a 55km stretch were scrutinised to track the movements of the assailants, who had arrived on a black Hero Splendor with no number plate. ""The accused waited outside the park and chased the victim inside, where they murdered him. After the incident, they escaped towards Outer Delhi using multiple routes.The CCTV analysis, combined with call detail records (CDRs), pointed towards the involvement of a 47-year-old man residing in Auchandi village, Chauhan added. His mobile phone was switched off during the relevant period, further raising suspicion. Police teams then apprehended his minor son, who led them to his father.Police have seized the motorcycle used in the crime. The accused has four FIRs registered at Malviya Nagar police station between 2006 and 2016, involving charges of attempt to murder, assault, criminal intimidation, and extortion.During interrogation, the accused revealed that the motive stemmed from a violent clash in 2016. At the time, Lakhpat Singh and his associates had allegedly assaulted the accused over a property dispute. A case was then registered against Singh and his brother, while a cross-case was filed against the accused and his family.""He has disclosed that he instigated his 17-year-old son to join him in the plan, timing the execution a day before the boy's 18th birthday to exploit juvenile laws. The accused deputed his son to recce the victim's morning routine and then arranged a country-made pistol,"" DCP Chauhan added.The son had come to stay with a relative in the area about 15 days before the incident and closely tracked the victim's movements. He noted that Singh regularly went for morning walks in Vijay Mandal Park. On Sept 25, he shared this information with his father, and together they executed the plan next morning. On Sept 26, the duo, with faces covered, arrived on a motorcycle without a number plate and executed the murder.","Property dealer Lakhpat Singh Kataria, 56, was shot dead in south Delhi's Malviya Nagar.

BJP, Congress Clash After Rahul Gandhi’s Jibe at PM Modi Over H-1B Fee Hike

The Congress party on Sunday wrote to home minister Amit Shah, raising concerns over a death threat issued against leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi during a televised debate. Congress leader KC Venugopal shared the letter he sent to Amit Shah, after Pintu Mahadev, spokesperson of Kerala BJP, reportedly said that “Rahul Gandhi will be shot in the chest.”Venugopal wrote on X: ""Disagreements in the political arena must be solved politically, within the constitutional framework. BJP leaders, however, are giving death threats to their political opponents on live TV. Surely, RahulGandhi ji’s vehement fight against the RSS-BJP ideology has rattled them.""Calling the threat “cold, calculated and chilling”, the party demanded urgent action. It said, ""This is neither a slip of the tongue, nor careless hyperbole. It is a cold, calculated and chilling death threat against the leader of the opposition and one of India's foremost political leaders.""The letter also pointed to multiple previous threats against Rahul Gandhi on social media, some linked to the BJP, and mentioned the assassination of Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi.The party called the threat a ""careless outburst of a petty functionary, symptomatic of a deliberately cultivated, toxic atmosphere of hate that renders the Lop vulnerable to mindless violence.""It urged the home minister to act immediately and decisively, warning that failure to do so would amount to “a de facto licence” for legitimising violence against Rahul Gandhi.""Any failure by you to act swiftly, decisively and publicly will be judged as complicity a de facto licence for the legitimisation and normalisation of violence against the leader of the opposition and a grave breach of your oath as Union home minister,"" it said.Also read: 'Stop the killing': Rahul Gandhi says 'Ladakh under attack by RSS, BJP'; pitches for 6th Schedule The letter added that millions of Indians regard Rahul Gandhi as a champion of rights and pluralistic values, emphasizing that a death threat against him amounts to an assault on democracy itself, not merely on one individual.","Congress leader KC Venugopal shared the letter he sent to Amit Shah, after Pintu Mahadev, spokesperson of Kerala BJP, reportedly said that “Rahul Gandhi will be shot in the chest” The party called the threat “cold, calculated and chilling”, the party demanded urgent action.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124196454,imgsize-38458,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-2025-09-28t203851508.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The seat-sharing negotiations for upcoming assembly elections in Bihar have become more complex as two new parties - Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and Pashupati Paras's LJP faction - joined the Mahagathbandhan alliance. The situation is getting trickier as major parties are firm on their seat demands.The 243 seats will now be divided among eight parties -- Rashtriya Janata Dal, Congress, CPI, CPM, VIP, LJP (Paras) and JMM.“Two more parties are expected to be part of the INDIA bloc soon and we all have to sacrifice our share of seats to accommodate the new partners.” State Congress president Rajesh Kumar told reporters after a discussion during a key meeting of INDIA bloc leaders at the official residence of RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav.Meanwhile, Congress insist that it cannot go below the 70 seats.VIP chief Mukesh Sahani, on the other hand, has demanded “60 seats plus the post of deputy CM” while the CPI-ML is pressing for at least 40 seats, pointing to its past performance.The RJD is also unwilling to contest on fewer than 150 seats.In 2020 assembly elections, Rashtriya Janata Dal had contested on 144 seats, of which it won 75.Congress won 19 out of 70 seats.CPI-ML contested 19 seats and won 12.CPM contested 4 seats and was successful in winning 2 seats.CPI contested on 6 seats and won 2 seats.RJD's Tejashwi Yadav has already declared himself as the CM face of the opposition INDIA bloc.Addressing the rally in Ara town, the last stopover of the 'Voter Adhikar Yatra', Tejashwi questioned the Nitish Kumar government in Bihar for ""frequently copying his ideas"" and described it as a ""copycat government"".

He allegedly wanted to give Rs 1 crore in cash in a hawala transaction to an areca nut trader in Tumakuru, identified as Mohan.Cab driver Hemanth (32), who is Mohan's nephew, went to collect the cash from Motaram Saturday.
