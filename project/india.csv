HASSAN: A day after JD(S)MLC Suraj Revanna's aide Shivakumar HL accused Chethan KS, 27, of trying to extort money over a sexual abuse charge, the latter filed an FIR , accusing Suraj of committing unnatural sex on him at Suraj's Gannikada farm in Holenarasipura on June 16.Following the FIR, Suraj has been summoned by CEN police in Hassan Town and is likely to be arrested.Hassan SP Mohammed Sujeetha confirmed to STOI that Chethan's complaint was first received through email and the same was forwarded to the Holenarasipura rural police station that took up the case.Suraj, though, has refuted the charges, saying that the case registered against him is a political conspiracy.He expressed his confidence in the legal system and said he would let the investigation take its own course.The FIR was registered against Suraj under IPC sec 377 (unnatural sex), 342 (wrongful confinement) 34 (common intention) and 506 (criminal intimidation).In his complaint, Chethan said he was an active JD(S) worker and had met Suraj at Kollangi village, during the last LS poll campaigns.

Opposition bloc may pull out from panel to aid pro tem Speaker,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/opposition-bloc-may-pull-out-from-panel-to-aid-pro-tem-speaker/articleshow/111196030.cms,"NEW DELHI: In continued aggression from the opposition that signals turbulence in the new Parliament , the anti-BJP bloc INDIA is likely to pull out its three members from the panel to assist the pro tem Speaker in protest against the govt “superseding” seniormost member in Lok Sabha K Suresh of Congress for the ceremonial post, which administers oath to the new MPs. Bhartruhari Mahtab of BJP has been named the pro tem Speaker.The new irritant in opposition-govt relationship came Saturday even as Congress demanded Modi regime put the three criminal laws on hold and undertake detailed discussions in Parliamentary committee and the two Houses to iron out their flaws.The three laws are up for implementation from July 1, and DMK and TMC have already asked the govt to defer them.AICC spokesman Jairam Ramesh said Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, and Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, were “bulldozed” through Parliament when 146 MPs had been suspended from LS and RS. He said they were “bulldozed” through the standing committee on home affairs without detailed interactions with stakeholders across the country and by ignoring dissent notes of MPs.With NEET/paper leaks and law on MSP already emerging as flashpoints ahead of Parliament session, opposition’s belligerence on criminal laws and on pro temSpeaker makes the mix a recipe for confrontation. Congress has alleged that Suresh, a Dalit member, has been ignored for pro tem Speaker’s post “for reasons other than merit”, and a boycott of the ceremonial functions by Suresh (Congress), Sudip Bandopadhyay (TMC), T R Baalu (DMK) will kick off the new LS on a sour note Monday. All indications are that the bitterness of the 17th LS is spilling over into the new one.While the pro tem post is only ceremonial, growing protest across parties against the three laws just ahead of their coming into force suggests a concerted action by INDIA constituents to force govt’s hand. The Modi regime passed the laws despite opposition protests last year, but the renewed aggression of the anti-BJP bloc appears a signal to Modi govt that it cannot ignore the rivals after their improved numbers post-poll.","Anti-BJP bloc INDIA is likely to pull out its three members from the panel to assist the pro tem Speaker in protest against the govt ""superseding"" seniormost member in Lok Sabha K Suresh of Congress for the ceremonial post.

NEW DELHI: Delhi's Rouse Avenue Court on Thursday granted bail to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on a bond of Rs 1 lakh in the money laundering case related to the alleged excise policy case. The court also declined Enforcement Directorate (ED) prayer to stay the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader's bail order for 48 hours.Kejriwal has been in jail since March 21 and was granted bail for a short period to campaign for his party during the Lok Sabha elections held last month.The court, however, imposed conditions on the bail, including prohibiting him from hampering the investigation or influencing witnesses. Kejriwal has been instructed to appear before the court whenever required and to cooperate with the investigation.Special Judge Niyay Bindu issued the order after listening to arguments from both the prosecution and the defence counsel. On Wednesday, Kejriwal's judicial custody had been extended until July 3.The judge had reserved the order earlier in the day after hearing arguments from the ED, which sought to link Kejriwal to the alleged proceeds of crime and co-accused individuals. The defense argued that the prosecution lacked evidence to substantiate claims against the AAP leader.ED will now move Delhi high court on Friday morning against trial court's judgement in Arvind Kejriwal case.AAP leader Atishi commented ""Satyamev Jayate"" (truth alone triumphs) following the grant of bail.Kejriwal's arrest stemmed from allegations tied to financial irregularities in the excise policy, which led to a high-profile investigation by the ED.

The mother has entered the Rajya Sabha, the son has entered the Lok Sabha from one seat, and Priyanka Gandhi has been made a member from another Lok Sabha seat. All three members of the family will be in the Parliament."" He further claimed that Rahul Gandhi, despite his win in Rae Bareli, is dependent on the Samajwadi Party's support and is unwilling to risk a by-election, which he believes could jeopardize a second victory.Poonawalla also criticized Rahul Gandhi's move to Wayanad, asserting that it was a betrayal to the people of the constituency. ""Annie Raja kept saying that Rahul Gandhi would move out of the state after the elections, which he did,"" he said, adding, ""Another thing has become very clear: the political legacy of the family will be with the son and not the daughter.""Earlier today, Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge announced that Rahul Gandhi would continue to represent Rae Bareli in the 18th Lok Sabha, while Priyanka Gandhi would contest from Wayanad. Kharge said that, ""Rahul Gandhi was elected from two seats. As per rules, he will have to vacate one seat and continue on one seat. Since June 18 is the last date, we have decided that Rahul should keep his Rae Bareli seat, since it has been very close to the family for a long time. He has received love from the people of Wayanad, and people there want him to retain the seat, but the rules do not allow it. So, after a lot of deliberations, we decided that Priyanka Gandhi should contest from Wayanad, and she has agreed.""Expressing her enthusiasm for the first electoral contest Priyanaka Gandhi said, ""I am very happy to be able to represent Wayanad. All I can say is that I won't let them feel his absence. As Rahul said, he will come many times with me, but I will work hard, and I will try to make everyone happy and be a good representative. I have a special connection with Rae Bareli. I have worked for 20 years in both Rae Bareli and Amethi.""Rahul Gandhi on reatining the Rae Bareli sear said that he had an emotional connection with both Rae Bareli and Wayanad.

Rahul takes potshots at PM



No one afraid of PM Modi now, says Rahul



NEW DELHI: Congress MP Rahul Gandhi on Thursday launched a fierce attack against the BJP-led government over alleged leak of NEET and UGC-NET exam papers that has affected tens of thousands of students, stating that he will be raising the matter in the upcoming session of Parliament and put immense pressure on the Centre.""Now, people are clear that we are sitting on a disaster and we have a government that is crippled. It is a national crisis, it's an economic crisis, it's an educational crisis, institutional crisis. But I don't see any response. I don't see a capability of response (from the government),"" the MP said during a press conference.The Congress MP went on to say that the silence of the government is because ""the PM is crippled""""Right now, the PM's main agenda is the (election of) the Speaker. He is bothered about his government and Speaker ... The PM has psychologically collapsed and he will struggle to run a government like this. PM Modi 's idea of running govt is to generate fear in people. But now people are not scared of him. The basic concept of Modi has been destroyed in this election. If there were Vajpayee ji or Manmohan Singh ji, they might have been able to survive because they had humility, respect and conciliation. But Narendra Modi doesn't believe in all this.""""Enquiry is underway, one (UGC-NET) has been cancelled; we don't know whether the other (NEET) one will be cancelled or not. But, someone is responsible for all this and they should be arrested and action should be taken against them,"" he added.He also explained why there has been a rise in such paper leaks.""The reason behind paper leaks is that the education system has been captured by the BJP's parent organisation. Till the time this is not reversed, paper leaks and cancellation of exams will go on. PM Modi has facilitated this capture. It is an anti-national activity,"" said Rahul.Talking directly to the affected students, the MP said: ""Our vice-chancellors are placed not based on merit but because they belong to a particular organisation. And this organisation and the BJP have penetrated our education system and destroyed it. What was done by PM Modi to the economy with demonetisation, has now been done to the education system. The reason this is happening and the reason you're suffering is because an independent, objective education system has been demolished ... It is very important that the people who are guilty here are brought to book and they are punished.""He went on to take a potshot at the PM, stating: ""It was said that Narendra Modi stopped the Ukraine-Russia conflict, Israel-Gaza war but due to some reason, he is either not able to stop the paper leaks in the country or he doesn't want to stop them. The students end up suffering as this is their future. Vyapam took place in Madhya Pradesh, which is now being spread across the country by PM Modi and his government.""""Now nobody in the country is afraid of him (PM Modi). Earlier the chest was 56 inches, but now I cannot give the number, but it has become 30-32 ... His way of working is to scare people, to intimidate them, now that fear is gone. I don't know if you saw it or not but someone hit him with a 'chappal' in Varanasi. Before the elections, if someone wanted to hit him, there was fear, now that fear has ended. There are internal problems too, there are problems in their party, there are issues in their parent organisation. So I want to say that the concept of Narendra Modi has been demolished by the opposition, it has been finished ... There is a very strong opposition, so it is a very interesting time,"" he added.",Congress MP Rahul Gandhi launched a fierce attack against the BJP-led government over alleged leak of NEET and UGC-NET exam papers.
