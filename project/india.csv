"In PCR call, Swati Maliwal accuses Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal's PA of beating her up at his behest",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-pcr-call-maliwal-accuses-cms-pa-of-beating-her-up-at-his-behest/articleshow/110098752.cms,"Maliwal reached police stn at 10.30am, left without filing FIR

NEW DELHI: High-voltage drama unfolded at chief minister Arvind Kejriwal 's residence in north Delhi on Monday morning after his party's Rajya Sabha MP, Swati Maliwal , claimed in a PCR call that she had been assaulted by Kejriwal's personal assistant , Bibhav , on the former's instructions. This brought the cops to the spot. Later, she went to the Civil Lines police station in order to file an FIR.However, after receiving some phone calls there, she left, telling the cops she would return. They were waiting till late at night.The cops marked her complaint as ""pending"" and no FIR had been filed till late Monday. Police have sought legal opinion on whether they can proceed on the basis of the DD entry and PCR call, a protocol followed in many cases.The incident took social media by storm. Bibhav and Swati have been with Kejriwal since his NGO days and their falling out has left a large section within AAP dismayed. It is particularly disturbing when Kejriwal is gearing up for poll campaign. AAP didn't react to the development.Swati's allegation that she was beaten up at the behest of Kejriwal has also angered many partymen.Maliwal reportedly arrived at the CM's residence around 9-9.10 am. She wanted to meet the CM which was allegedly denied by his personal staff and security. This led to the fracas and Maliwal sought police help. According to sources, Delhi Police's control room received a call from Maliwal around 9.24-25 am. ""This is Swati Maliwal, MP, calling from 6 Flag Staff Road. Vibhav has assaulted me on the CM's instruction,"" she said in the call which was logged.The PCR log states: ""Caller bol raha hai 'main abhi CM ke ghar par hu, unhone apne PA Bibhav Kumar se mujhe buri tarah pitwaya hai'."" It was the SHO of Civil Lines who had reached the CM's residence with his team. Maliwal, cops said, reiterated her complaint and was requested to come to the police station. She was seen boarding an auto from near the CM's residence around 9.50am.She was reportedly heading for some other place but reached the police station around 10.30am to lodge an FIR. However, she received a few calls there after which she stood up within a few minutes of her arrival and said she had to leave, policemen present there said. Around 10.50 am, Maliwal boarded another auto and left the station saying she would come back later.A former video journalist with a magazine, Bibhav Kumar is one of Kejriwal's most trusted aides. He has also faced ED's scrutiny in the excise policy-linked money laundering probe besides the case related to alleged irregularities in Delhi Jal Board. In February, ED had conducted raids at 12 locations, including those connected to Bibhav Kumar and AAP lawmaker ND Gupta. Last month, it had questioned Bibhav in the excise policy case as well. Recently, the directorate of vigilance had terminated Bibhav's services as personal secretary to the chief minister.Maliwal, who was previously listed as a star campaigner for Delhi, has not found a place in Punjab star campaigners’ list, evoking a response from BJP. “Instead of an inquiry being ordered, she has been removed from the star campaigner list,” said Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva.“Our ideology may be different from that of Maliwal but it can’t be ignored that she has worked for women, including getting illegal spas closed,” said another party functionary, Tajinder Bagga.","Rajya Sabha MP Swati Maliwal claimed in a PCR call that she had been assaulted by Kejriwal's personal assistant Bibhav Kumar.

‘There is no anti-incumbency against me’ says Kaushal Kishore,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/there-is-no-anti-incumbency-against-me/articleshow/110098474.cms,"Kaushal Kishore

Is there anti-incumbency against you? If yes, what’s your strategy to overcome it?

Despite numerous meetings with you, locals say many of their longstanding demands remain unmet such as a government college for girls and a flyover near Mohanlalganj tehsil.

INDIA bloc has pledged to conduct a caste-based census and to raise reservation above 50% if it assumes office. What are your views and those of your party?

Will your rival, INDIA bloc’s RK Chaudhary, pose a challenge?

Will it be ‘Abki baar 400 paar’ for BJP?

Union minister and BJP candidate,, is seeking a straight third term from Mohanlalganj and says there is no anti-incumbency against him. Amid a hectic day of public meetings and engaging with voters at his residence, Kaushal Kishore spoke toabout his campaign and BJP’s vision.There is no anti-incumbency against me.I have been in the constituency even before the enforcement of the model code of conduct, and have been constantly engaging with the people in five assembly segments. Around 1,000 people visit my house daily seeking assistance. I personally interact with them, and even my personal phone number is available to every member of the Mohanlalganj constituency . People across the country have recognized BJP as the party dedicated to the nation's development.Defence minister Rajnath Singh has assured that flyover from Koneshwar Crossing to Dubagga and Sitapur Bypass will be built. As for the other pending demands, I have written to the authorities regarding both the overbridge near Mohanlalganj tehsil and the government college for girls. Work will begin after elections. Mohanlalganj MLA has also advocated for a dedicated government college for girls, and work will begin soon.(Laughs) Rahul Gandhi always tells a pack of lies. What reservation did Rahul Gandhi and his party provide when they were in power? PM Modiji has consistently worked for the people of the country. We revoked Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir to uphold the Constitution. Soon, we will witness people from POK wanting to reside in India, supporting our govt. The opposition lacks concrete plans and issues, so it tries to mislead people by raking up such issues. Modiji and my party have never discriminated against giving facilities on lines of religion or caste. We categorize castes into four parts: women, youth, farmers, and poor. Our PM and leadership will decide on the census after the elections.In a democracy, everyone has the right to contest elections. I am confident of winning with a significant margin. You will get the answer on June 4.Yes, for sure. People will give us the numbers to make India a ‘Surakshit Bharat, Behtar Bharat, Viksit Bharat, Atmanirbhar Bharat’. People have become wise. Recently, former Pakistan minister Fawad Chaudhry praised Rahul Gandhi, calling him ‘saheb’ and suggesting he has the qualities to become PM, while urging people to ‘stop Modi’. Voting for Congress, Samajwadi Party, Mamata Banerjee, or Rahul Gandhi is now being seen as voting for a PM under Pakistan’s influence. Nobody wants that, so they have decided to vote for ‘Viksit Bharat’ and ‘Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat’.",Kaushal Kishore is seeking a straight third term from Mohanlalganj and says there is no anti-incumbency against him.

He also added that the nation expects Modi to participate in the debate.Rahul’s post was in reply to Justice (Retd) Madan B Lokur, Justice (Retd) Ajit P Shah and senior journalist N Ram, who had written to him and the PM earlier this week, inviting them to a platform for a debate on the key election issues.“Congress welcomes this initiative and accepts the invitation for a discussion,” Rahul said. “We agree that such a debate will help people understand our respective vision and enable them to make an informed choice. It is also critical to put to rest any unsubstantiated allegations attributed to our respective parties. As the principal parties fighting the election, the public deserves to hear from their leaders directly. Accordingly, either myself or the Congress President would be pleased to participate in such a debate,” he added.In the invite addressed to PM Modi and Rahul, it was pointed out that the PM has publicly challenged Congress on reservations, Article 370 and wealth redistribution. On the other hand, Kharge has questioned the PM on possible “mutilation” of the Constitution, electoral bond scheme and the govt’s response to China and also challenged him to a public debate. In this backdrop, a debate will help the citizens to hear directly from the political leaders, the invite said.","Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday said he or party chief Mallikarjun Kharge would be pleased to participate in such a discussion. “It would be a positive initiative for the major parties to present their vision to the country from one platform for a healthy democracy,” Rahul wrote on X.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110043668,imgsize-51232,width-400,resizemode-4/110043668.jpg"

Did not attend Ram mandir opening fearing humiliation as I am Dalit: Kharge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/did-not-attend-ram-mandir-opening-fearing-humiliation-as-i-am-dalit-kharge/articleshow/110094771.cms,"RANCHI/HAZARIBAG: Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge lashed out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday for trying to impose dictatorial rule in the country and said fear of humiliation kept him away from theRam temple inauguration in Ayodhya .Kharge, said he didn't attend the ""pran-prastitha"" ceremony at the Ram mandir earlier this year due to ""fear of being humiliated"" as he is from the Dalit community.Addressing his maiden 2024 Lok Sabha election rally in Jharkhand at Netarhat, in Chatra parliamentary constituency, Kharge asked, ""Why wasn't President Droupadi Murmu, who is a tribal, invited for the opening of the Parliament building or the 'pran-pratistha' at the Ram mandir? Why wasn't former President Ramnath Kovind , who is a Dalit, invited to the foundation-stone-laying ceremony of the Parliament building?""""I received the invitation for the Ram mandir but gave it a miss, fearing they would have kept doing 'shuddi' (purification) of the premises soon after.

You didn't invite them because you thought you will become 'apavitra (impure)',"" he claimed, appealing to voters to rise above caste and community to defeat Modi before it is too late.Explaining that the ongoing polls are strategic for the country, its Constitution, democracy, and existence, Kharge urged voters not to allow a dictatorial regime, citing how tribal chief minister Hemant Soren has been imprisoned in false cases as he did not bow before BJP.Hemant Soren's wife, Kalpana Soren, stoked ""tribal Asmita"" to strike a chord with voters. ""When they (BJP) denied you (the voters) houses and pension, the Hemant-led state govt launched a housing scheme to provide houses to the poor and the universal pension scheme. Hence, they tried to dislodge the govt and jailed him (Hemant) in fake cases. But people will fight against BJP excesses in the country now,"" Kalpana Soren said.Kharge also addressed a rally at Barhi, under Hazaribag parliamentary seat. Attacking Modi and BJP's divisive agenda and their changing narratives with each passing phase, he said, ""They began the election with 'abki baar, 400 paar', but shifted to mutton, mangalsutra and Muslims. This is reflective of Modi's nervousness as he knows that they are on a sticky wicket. It is time to vote for jobs, communal harmony, and to restore your fundamental rights as a citizen of this country.""He added that BJP and Modi's USP was to spread lies about Congress's manifesto, which talks about inclusiveness. ""He (Modi) now says that Adanis and Ambanis are sending money to Congress. Who is stopping you from acting against Adanis and Ambanis? Are you scared of them? When you can put opposition leaders in jail on charges of money recovery, why can't you find the money trail of Adanis and Ambanis?"" he questioned.Congress fielded K N Tripathi as the INDIA bloc candidate from the Chatra Lok Sabha seat and Jay Prakash Bhai Patel, who had recently switched to Congress from BJP, from Hazaribag.

A police contingent was assigned to her thereafter.Sonipat nominee Mohan Lal Badoli also required police intervention after heckling and haranguing by farmers.Officials said the intelligence agencies were on the job to pre-empt any protest brewing in a particular area ahead of poll campaigning by BJP and JJP candidates.In contrast to the former allies, Congress candidates have been campaigning freely and focusing on local issues, besides BJP's alleged plan to ""change the Constitution and snatch the rights of backward communities"".The undercurrents impeding BJP and JJP's poll campaigns coincided with the farmers' agitation at Shambhu and Khanauri on the Punjab-Haryana border completing three months on Monday.Farm organisations are sticking to their demand for a legal guarantee on minimum support price & a blanket debt waiver, among other things.On February 13, the tractor convoys that Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (Non-Political) and Kisan Mazdoor Morcha (KMM) had sent out to Delhi ran into concrete walls and boulders at Shambhu near Ambala and Khanauri near Sangrur, a barrier that continues to hold them down.KMM convener Sarvan Singh Pandher said, ""We didn't block the roads at Shambhu and Khanauri, it was the Haryana govt that did so.
