"Gautam Adani indictment: 4 states named by US had governments led by Congress and its allies, says BJP",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gautam-adani-indictment-4-states-named-by-us-had-governments-led-by-congress-and-its-allies-says-bjp/articleshow/115547783.cms,"NEW DELHI: BJP on Thursday aggressively responded to Rahul Gandhi's allegations against PM Narendra Modi over the indictment of Gautam Adani in the US, accusing the Congress functionary of seeking to undermine the PM without any justification.While staying clear of the charges against the Adani group by US agencies, BJP MP and spokesperson Sambit Patra said the states allegedly involved in the said bribery - Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh - were governed by opposition parties during the period in question (July 2021 to Feb 2022).""All four states that have been named in the document neither had our chief ministers nor a govt supported by us. They all had govts of Congress and its allies,"" he said. This, according to Patra, suggested that if there was any malpractice, it occurred under the watch of opposition-led states, not under BJP governance.Patra accused Congress of hypocrisy and sought answers from Rahul. ""As Chhattisgarh chief minister, why did Bhupesh Baghel take Rs 25,000 crore investment from Adani Group? As Rajasthan CM, why did Ashok Gehlot take Rs 65,000 crore investment from Adani Group? Why did your CM in Karnataka Siddaramaiah sign an MoU with Adani Group for Rs 1,00,000 crore investment? In Bengal, where you have nexus, Adani group has invested Rs 35,000 crore. Tamil Nadu has an investment of Rs 4,500 crore,"" he said.""On Oct 19, 2024, why did Telangana CM Revanth Reddy take a grant of Rs 100 crore for skill development from Adani Foundation? While according to you he is a corrupt person. Congress and Rahul Gandhi should answer all these questions,"" he said, adding that the law would take its course on the allegations against Adani.Patra said Rahul's allegations Thursday fitted the pattern of him, his mother Sonia Gandhi and Congress trying to tarnish Modi's image since 2002, a reference to the communal riots in Gujarat when Modi was chief minister, but in vain.The spokesman said Rahul alleged corruption in the Rafale deal in the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and had also gone after the central govt over the Covid vaccines issue, adding the Supreme Court had dismissed the bribery charges in procurement of the fighter jet.Instead of levelling allegations in pressers, Rahul should move courts and lodge cases if he believed that there was any wrongdoing, he added.Patra said BJP had repeatedly moved courts and received favourable judgments in its demand for an investigation into charges of corruption against the previous Congress-led UPA govt. He said Rahul has been trying to target the Indian economy by making all kinds of allegations and over 2.5 crore investors lost a lot of money as the stock market tanked on Thursday.Patra also objected to Rahul's claim that his party had to do the job of judiciary as well, saying it amounted to contempt of court. ""He does not understand legalities and technicalities around an issue and merely repeats what he is briefed by advisors,"" he added.","BJP MP and spokesperson Sambit Patra said the states allegedly involved in the said bribery were governed by opposition parties during the period in question.

And after state Congress chief Nana Patole said that Congress would be in a leadership position in govt formation, Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut said that if Patole wants to be CM, the Congress high command must announce his name and added that the MVA partners would decide their chief ministerial candidate together.Amid all the squabbling, Sena minister Deepak Kesarkar also said that ""if necessary, Mahayuti will form a govt with the support of independents.""After most exit polls projected a majority for Mahayuti, Patole said, ""MVA govt will be formed in Maharashtra under the leadership of Congress. The way voting trends are emerging, the way people are talking, on that basis, (it can be said that) most of the Congress candidates will be elected. CM will be from MVA.""Raut said about Patole's statement with regard to Congress 'leadership', ""I will not accept this and no one else will accept this. We will sit together and decide if Nana Patole has said this and if Patole has Congress command's nod. If you are becoming CM, then Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Sonia Gandhi should announce it.""Raut said the MVA will stake claim to form govt in the evening of Nov 23 itself. He said MVA will decide its CM face that day and support of independents will not be needed as MVA will cross 160 seats on its own. Raut rubbished exit polls and described them as ""a fraud.""The chief ministership has been a bone of contention between Congress and Sena (UBT). The Sena (UBT) has constantly been saying MVA should have declared a CM face before the polls. Raut and Patole had face-offs over the issue of chief ministership and seat-sharing in MVA right till the last day of filing nominations.BJP's Bawankule said, ""Our workers feel Fadnavis should become CM, Shinde's workers feel he should be CM. The central leadership has to decide.""Sena's Shirsat said, ""It is true that Chandrashekar Bawankule has said his party's leader must become CM. This is natural. We have fought the polls with Shinde as the face and people have voted for us, which shows his popularity. People have preferred Shinde's face. So we feel that it is Shinde's right to become CM and that he will remain CM. We are sure about this. Whatever decision Shinde takes, we will go with him.""",Tiff over CM's post broke out on Thursday within the Mahayuti as well as in the Maha Vikas Aghadi.

NEW DELHI: Two more exit poll agencies released their projections on Thursday giving boost to Eknath-Shinde led Mahayuti in Maharashtra assembly elections.According to Today's Chanakya exit poll predictions, Mahayuti is projected to secure 175 ± 11 seats, while the Congress-led Maha Vikas Agadi (MVA) is expected to win 100 ± 11 seats. The agency has projected 13 ± 5 seats for other parties and independents.Meanwhile, Axis My India also predicted 178-200 seats for Mahayuti and 82-102 for MVA. The agency has predicted 6-12 seats for others and Independents.The Axis My India exit poll results have also revealed that Eknath Shinde is the preferred chief minister choice at 31 per cent, followed by Uddhav Thackeray at 18 per cent and Devendra Fadnavis at 12 per cent.With this, the Mahayuti is now projected to win 168 seats, according to the poll of polls, MVA 109 and others are likely to get 11 seats.The two exit poll results are in line with the projections released a day earlier where most polls on predicted victory for the BJP-led alliance in Maharashtra.On Wednesday, three pollsters - Peoples Pulse, Matrize and Chankya Strategies predicted clear majority for the Mahayuti while three - P-Marq, Dainik Bhaskar and Poll Diary predicted Mahayuti ahead of the MVA, but short of majority.The Matrize exit poll predicted 150-170 seats for the BJP and allies in Maharashtra with a 48 per cent vote share, it gave the Congress and other allies only 110-130 seats with a vote share of 42 per cent. The poll gave others 8 to 10 seats, with a vote share of 10 per cent. People's Pulse gave NDA's Mahayuti a whopping 175-195 seats while giving only 85-112 seats to MVA and 7-12 to others in Maharashtra.The actual results will be announced by the Election Commission on November 23.During the 2019 assembly elections, BJP had secured its position as the dominant party by winning 105 seats, whilst their alliance partner Shiv Sena obtained 56 seats. A disagreement over the chief minister's position led to Uddhav Thackeray's separation from the BJP. Subsequently, he established the MVA administration with support from Congress and the NCP, which had secured 44 and 54 seats respectively.The BJP orchestrated its response in 2022 when Eknath Shinde caused a division within the Shiv Sena, leading to the MVA government's collapse. The BJP then appointed Shinde as the chief minister. The following year, Ajit Pawar's rebellion against his uncle Sharad Pawar and the subsequent NCP split resulted in the formation of the Mahayuti.",Two more exit poll agencies released their projections on Thursday giving boost to Eknath-Shinde led Mahayuti in Maharashtra assembly elections.

Sharad Pawar defends Sule, criticises BJP over ‘bitcoin scam’ allegations



'Her own brother is saying that this is her voice,' says BJP's Sambit Patra

NEW DELHI: A major political controversy has emerged on Maharashtra's polling day concerning allegations of Bitcoin scam money being utilised for election funding by NCP(SP) leader Supriya Sule and Congress leader Nana Patole .The BJP released an audio recording on Tuesday, making serious allegations against Supriya Sule and Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole.While Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar claimed that it was her ""sister's voice"" in the audio clip shared by BJP, Supriya Sule categorically rejected these accusations.On the eve of Maharashtra elections , former Pune IPS officer Ravindranath Patil accused Baramati MP Supriya Sule and Maharashtra Congress president Nana Patole of misappropriating bitcoins from a 2018 cryptocurrency fraud case to finance the state elections.Patil claimed that Amitabh Gupta, then Pune Police Commissioner, and Bhagyashri Nautake, then deputy commissioner of Police, were also involved in this alleged bitcoin misappropriation, ultimately benefiting Sule and Patole.After casting her vote in Baramati, Sule firmly denied the bitcoin misappropriation claims and dismissed the circulated audio clips as fake.“Yesterday, all these voice recordings were sent to me by the media. The first thing I did was to call the commissioner of Pune and tell him that some fake videos were running, and I wanted to complain to cybercrime,” Sule stated.“I immediately complained to cybercrime that all these voice notes and messages were lies and fake, so I sent a notice to cybercrime,” she added.When asked about her brother Ajit Pawar’s comments regarding the audio clip, she responded, ""He is Ajit Pawar, he can say anything. 'Ram Krishna Hari.'""In addition to the cybercrime complaint, Sule filed a criminal defamation notice against BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi. “I am ready to come out and answer Sudhanshu Trivedi anytime in whichever city he wants, on whichever channel he wants, at whatever time he wants, wherever he calls me, I will come and I will answer him,” she said.Sule further stated, “Familiar tactics of spreading false information to manipulate the righteous voters are being resorted to, a night before the polling day. We have filed a criminal complaint to the Hon’ble ECI & the Cyber crime department against the fake allegations made of bitcoin misappropriation.”The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday searched the Raipur premises of Gaurav Mehta, an employee of audit firm Sarathi Associates, in connection with an alleged bitcoin scam. The raids aim to trace financial irregularities tied to cryptocurrency transactions linked to the ongoing Maharashtra assembly elections, officials said.Ravindranath Patil alleged the involvement of Amitabh Gupta and Bhagyashri Nautake and said, ""My company called me as a cryptocurrency expert to investigate a case in 2018. I was arrested in that case in 2022 under allegations of fraud. I spent 14 months in jail after a trial. During that time, I was wondering what had happened, what the case was, and why I was trapped. There were other colleagues also with me. We were working on finding out the truth. A witness against us, Gaurav Mehta, who is an employee of an audit firm named Sarathi Associates.""A day before yesterday, he called me multiple times for 4-5 hours, but I did not respond... Finally, when I responded, he told me that in 2018, when Amit Bharadwaj was arrested, he had a cryptocurrency hardware wallet... That wallet was replaced by the then commissioner Amitabh Gupta and another wallet was kept. We were arrested but the real perpetrators were Amitabh Gupta and his team. He (Gaurav Mehta) took the names of two IPS officers, Amitabh Gupta and Bhagyashri Nautake. He took two people's name one is Supriya Sule and Nana Patole. He then told me that in this assembly elections bitcoins are being used,"" Patil alleged further.The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has registered an FIR into a bitcoin-based ponzi scam against Amit Bhardwaj, Ajay Bhardwaj and others.The accused persons allegedly collected 80,000 bitcoins and diverted the funds worth Rs 6,606 crore through nine overseas firms to purchase properties abroad. The agency has also summoned Gaurav Mehta to join the investigation, the CBI sources told news agency ANI.Meanwhile, Patole denying any involvement in the alleged case said, ""The IPS officer brought by BJP, Ravindra Patil is not even an IPS officer. BJP has become a party of lies. On the eve of elections, they are doing all this. My voice is not there in the audio. I am a farming man, I don't even understand Bitcoin. We have given a legal notice and filed an FIR. We will also file a defamation case against them. Be it Sudhanshu Trivedi or Ravindra Patil. Everything will be clear soon. BJP is only lying. We will fight them legally...I have nothing to do with this. We will file defamation...Our government is going to be formed in Maharashtra, we will conduct a proper inquiry in this.""Nationalist Congress Party (NCP-SCP) chief Sharad Pawar defended Supriya Sule and said, ""The person who made the allegations was in jail for several months, and taking that person along and making false allegations—only BJP can do this.""BJP MP and national spokesperson Sambit Patra, in a press conference, criticised Supriya Sule’s denial of the allegations, pointing to her brother Ajit Pawar’s acknowledgment of her voice in the recordings. ""Today Supriya Sule is saying that this is AI generated, this is not my voice, whereas her own brother is saying that this is her voice,"" Patra remarked.Patra elaborated on the allegations, claiming, ""There are four such audios of Supriya Sule... you can also see Nana Patole giving instructions to Amitabh Gupta, the commissioner. In the chat that has taken place in the Signal app, apart from Supriya Sule and Nana Patole, there are some other big players. If there is any biggest player in this game of loot and corruption in this country, then it is Sonia ji and Rahul ji,"" he stated, urging Rahul Gandhi to clarify whether he directed Patole.
