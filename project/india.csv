Uttarakhand seizes land of UP MLA Raja Bhaiya’s wife,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/uttarakhand-seizes-land-of-up-mla-raja-bhaiyas-wife/articleshow/114161154.cms,"DEHRADUN: In a move that has drawn attention amid the Uttarakhand govt’s consideration of a stringent law to safeguard agricultural land from acquisition by ‘outsiders’, the district administration of Nainital has confiscated over half a hectare (27.5 nali) of land belonging to Bhanvi Singh , the estranged wife of Uttar Pradesh MLA Raghuraj Pratap Singh, also known as Raja Bhaiya .The land, located under Kainchi Dham subdivision, was bought in 2006 for agricultural purposes, but no farming activity has taken place since.The revenue department initiated proceedings to seize the property after an inquiry. Despite challenging the action in the commissioner’s court and the board of revenue, Singh’s appeals were rejected.Naresh Aswal, a revenue department official, said Uttarakhand law mandates land purchased for agriculture must be used for that purpose within two years. “Our surveys indicated no agricultural activity on the land since 2006, prompting us to initiate the process of vesting the property in the govt,” he said.According to administrative sources, Singh had fenced the land with barbed wire to prevent encroachment, but after the lack of farming was noted, she was served a notice. After she lost her appeals, the state formally took possession of the land.Bipin Chandra Pant, Kainchi Dham sub-divisional magistrate, said the land is now under govt control and the fencing has been removed. The property is estimated to be worth between 14 crore and 15 crore. Raja Bhaiya, known as UP’s ‘strongman’ lawmaker, is an MLA (Jansatta Dal Loktantrik) from Kunda assembly.","Bhanvi Singh is estranged wife of Uttar Pradesh MLA Raghuraj Pratap Singh, also known as Raja Bhaiya.

BJP: ‘Rahul Gandhi bachao committee’: BJP takes dig at Congress' fact-finding committee over Haryana polls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rahul-gandhi-bachao-committee-bjp-takes-dig-at-congress-fact-finding-committee-over-haryana-polls/articleshow/114147192.cms,"File photo: BJP national spokesperson Shahzad Poonawalla (Picture credit: ANI)

As the results of the Haryana assembly election left Congress scratching its head, Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) on Friday took a jibe at the party's decision to make a committee to probe the poor show by calling it ' Rahul Gandhi bachao committee'.BJP national spokesperson Shahzad Poonawalla said that the aim of this committee was to not find facts but to ‘save’ Rahul Gandhi from the responsibility for the loss and blame someone else for the same.""This is less of a fact-finding committee and more of Rahul Gandhi bachao committee. The committee only aims to blame someone else for the defeat. Since Rahul Gandhi began the Bharat Jodo Yatra , they have lost 11 elections and won only two to three, that too with the help of crutches,"" ANI quoted Poonawalla as saying.Poonawalla further targeted the Congress leader by reminding his poor track record in fighting elections, which he said was 73 to 74 lost elections, also including the three Lok Sabha elections.""The main fact is that Rahul Gandhi almost lost 73 to 74 elections including three Lok Sabha elections. Despite that, Rahul Gandhi is sitting in the fact-finding committee and KC Venugopal 's ticket distribution is also being questioned. All of them are trying to blame Kumari Selja for the loss and she was not even called in the meeting that was held yesterday. We have also heard that the Congress has insulted the Dalits, and that is also a reason why they lost in Haryana,"" he said.According to Poonawalla, Rahul’s adoption of the ‘divide and rule’ policy to break the nation has not gone well with the people. Instead, the use of this policy has angered the public.""Rahul Gandhi adopted the divide and rule policy to break the country which has hurt and caused anger among the people. Can any committee take action on Rahul Gandhi now? Even the EVM has been balmed. In all states EVM is fine, but it only goes wrong in Haryana? The Congress party does not want to face the reality and have lost because of their arrogance and their disconnect with the people,"" Poonawalla added.Expressing their surprise at the poll results, Congress has described it as ""totally unexpected, completely surprising, counter-intuitive and against ground-reality and said ""it is not possible"" for the party ""to accept the results"".A party delegation also met the Election Commission over the issue on Wednesday.Congress won 37 seats, raising its tally from 31 in previous elections.
