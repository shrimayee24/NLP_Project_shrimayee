NAGPUR: A 35-year-old woman and her 17-year-old son, while trying to fight off an alleged rape bid on the mother, ended up killing a contractor at the construction site where they were working in June. While the mother of four languished in prison, the children’s father, who had supposedly tormented the family for years, allegedly raped the couple’s minor daughters over three months.The horrific abuse came to light in Oct after the couple’s younger son (14) caught the father and sought help from a neighbour, who alerted a group of transgender people living nearby. Members of the transgender community allegedly stormed the accused’s residence, rescued the children, thrashed the father and handed him over to Wathoda Police. Cops arrested the father and booked him under Pocso Act. The survivors — aged between 9 and 12 — were sent to a govt shelter for rehabilitation and counselling.Married off at 14, the woman had fled from Delhi to Nagpur in Dec 2024 with her kids to escape years of domestic violence.

‘Is There Any Law?’ Renuka Chaudhary Sparks Row After Bringing Stray Dog to Parliament

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday weighed in on the controversy over colleague Renuka Chowdhury bringing a stray dog to Parliament House, saying pets are not allowed outside the complex but “inside”.“Dog is the main topic of today, I believe. What has the poor dog done. The dog had come here. Why is it not allowed?” Gandhi told reporters, as quoted by PTI.Pointing towards the Parliament House building, he said, “Pets are not allowed here but they are allowed inside.”“I guess these are the things that India is discussing these days,” he added.Gandhi’s comments drew criticism from BJP spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari, who said on X, “Rahul Gandhi is comparing his own Congressmen, and Opposition leaders to Dog! This is how Parivarvadi treat temple of democracy.”Congress MP Renuka Chowdhury on Monday brought a stray dog onto the Parliament grounds on the first day of the Winter Session, despite objections from fellow MPs. Defending her action, she reportedly said that the ""real dogs are sitting in Parliament"" who regularly bite people.Chowdhury later explained that she had found the puppy on her way to Parliament. She said she stopped after witnessing a collision between a scooter and a car, and noticed the puppy by the roadside before deciding to take it with her.","Congress MP Renuka Chowdhury brought a stray dog onto the Parliament grounds on the first day of the Winter Session.

Allegation of fraud in entire selection process not sustainable: HC

KOLKATA: Calcutta high court Wednesday decided against scrapping the recruitment of 32,000 teachers for state-run primary schools, setting aside the order of Justice Abhijit Ganguly, who has since become a BJP MP, report Subrata Chattoraj & Poulami Roy.In 2023, Justice Ganguly, while cancelling the appointments based on 2014 Teacher Eligibility Test, said the jobs were “actually sold”. A larger bench had stayed the order.HC said it was setting aside the order because the “conclusion by the investigating authority (CBI) would not reveal that the appointed candidates were involved in any corrupt practices”.The allegation of fraud and corruption pertaining to the entire recruitment process is not sustainable and the appointment of the 32,000 teachers cannot be interfered with,” a bench of Justices Tapabrata Chakraborty and Reetobroto Mitra, hearing an appeal by the state govt against Justice Ganguly’s order, ruled.Cautioning courts against “innovating at pleasure”, the bench said, “There must have been a possibility of systemic malice, assessment of data doesn’t point to the same.”The division bench noted that CBI only found irregularities in the recruitment of 360 candidates. Of them, 264 candidates were given grace marks and identified. Additionally, 96 candidates did not secure qualifying marks but were still appointed.Their services were terminated but they are still teaching following a Supreme Court order.After the verdict, Ganguly said, “They (the HC bench) did what they thought was right. What can I say? Unless I read the judgment and its reasoning, I cannot speak.”CM Mamata Banerjee gave a cautious response. “We respect the judicial process. I’m happy our brothers and sisters have got their jobs back,” she said. Her education minister Bratya Basu showed less restraint. “They (teachers) thought him to be their God, but he turned out to be Satan,” he said.BJP’s Suvendu Adhikari defended Ganguly. “I can’t comment on the judiciary’s order but apparently, there were irregularities in the recruitment process in both TET & SLST. It is also true that thousands of deserving candidates suffered in both cases due to the presence of tainted candidates in the panel. TMC is responsible for pushing them to such a situation.”","Allegation of fraud in entire selection process not sustainable: HC. Calcutta high court sets aside the order of Justice Abhijit Ganguly.

BENGALURU: A special court for elected representatives in Bengaluru on Tuesday rejected the ‘B report’ — a case-closure report citing insufficient evidence to substantiate the allegations made in a complaint — filed by SIT, stating that there was not enough proof to clear JDS MLC Suraj Revanna of the charges of raping a man.This was the second of two rape cases filed against Suraj, the grandson of former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda and nephew of Union minister H D Kumaraswamy. In the first case, in which he is accused of raping a party worker, the SIT has filed a chargesheet. In the second case, a co-accused from the first case filed a police complaint alleging that he, too, was subjected to unnatural sex by the MLC.Recently, the victim in the second case filed a protest petition before the special court challenging the SIT’s closure report. Allowing the protest petition, special judge K N Shivakumar directed the SIT to continue the investigation and submit a fresh report by Dec 29.According to sources, SIT filed the closure report as it did not come across scientific or electronic evidence to establish charges.","This was the second of two rape cases filed against Suraj, the grandson of former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda and nephew of Union minister H D Kumaraswamy.

Rajnath Singh Claims Nehru Wanted Babri Built With Public Funds But Sardar Patel Blocked His Plan

NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Wednesday stood by his statement that Pt Jawahar Lal Nehru had wanted to rebuild the Babri mosque with public money, with his office issuing documentary evidence to support his claim, which was rebutted by Congress and other opposition parties.Singh had made the claim while addressing a gathering at Sadhli village in Gujarat’s Vadodara district on Tuesday. Responding to it, Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said the claim was aimed at diverting attention from real issues that need to be discussed.“Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was truly secular... When Pt Jawaharlal Nehru spoke about spending govt funds on the Babri masjid issue, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel opposed it. At that time, he did not allow the Babri masjid to be built with govt money. Nehru ji raised the question of reconstruction of the Somnath temple... Sardar clarified that the Somnath temple case was different; the public had donated Rs 30 lakh there, a trust had been formed, and not even a single penny of govt money was used. Ram mandir in Ayodhya has not been funded by govt money. The entire cost has been borne by the people of this country,” Singh said.The defence minister drew the information from Inside Story of Sardar Patel (The diary of Maniben Patel 1936-50), a book authored by Prabha Chopra. It was published in 2011 when Congress was in governance, and Nehru Memorial Library has a copy of the book. It is based on the diary of Maniben Patel, the daughter of Sardar Patel. The senior BJP neta’s office shared excerpts of the book to “validate” his claim.Congress, however, termed Rajnath’s claim a “lie” and “WhatsApp university story”, and said he should not tread PM Narendra Modi’s path. “These are all distractions. There are many other real issues that need to be discussed. They create a new distraction every day so that we are unable to discuss the real issues of the people,” Vadra told reporters.Asked about the issue at a press conference, Congress’ media and publicity department head Pawan Khera said, “We would like to tell the defence minister — ‘aap toh aise na the’ (you weren’t like this). We can understand others, the PM is very learned, we can understand him making such statements... show us evidence.” Congress’ whip in Lok Sabha Manickam Tagore said it is very surprising to see Rajnath “running these kinds of fake news factories and WhatsApp university stories”.","Defence minister Rajnath Singh stood by his statement that Pt Jawahar Lal Nehru had wanted to rebuild the Babri mosque with public money.
