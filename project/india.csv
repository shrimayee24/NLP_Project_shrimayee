Marathi vs non-Marathi fight flares up in Maharashtra over lighting of incense,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/marathi-vs-non-marathi-fight-flares-up-in-maharashtra-over-lighting-of-incense/articleshow/116516113.cms,"Mumbai & Maharashtra belong to Marathi people: CM Devendra Fadnavis

KALYAN/NAGPUR: An argument between two residents of a building in Kalyan over lighting of incense escalated into a Marathi vs non-Marathi dispute , which echoed in the Maharashtra legislative assembly on Friday and led to suspension of the MTDC officer who allegedly assaulted his neighbour.CM Devendra Fadnavis told the House an FIR had been registered against the officer, Akhilesh Shukla, and the process to suspend him had been initiated. On Friday, police arrested Shukla and two associates for assault and use of derogatory language against his next-door Marathi couple.Replying to opposition's charge in the assembly that Marathis were being discriminated in their own state, Fadnavis said: ""Mumbai and Maharashtra belong to Marathi people. Sometimes such characters (Shukla) display arrogance and make brazen statements. But we will not rest until the arrogance of such people is taken down,"" he said. ""Just like we have a national identity, we also have a regional identity. That regional identity means we are all Marathi. If anyone is attacking that, then we are as upset as you are, so strict action will definitely be taken.""In the same breath, Fadnavis added that the metropolis was ""a global city"" which draws people and ""everybody lives in harmony.""Shiv Sena UBT MLC Anil Parab said the incident occurred because BJP was in power. ""This is arrogance of power of BJP."" Congress MLC Bhai Jagtap said: ""From where are people deriving this confidence to make brazen statements?"" However, Fadnavis said opposition was needlessly giving the issue a political colour and blaming BJP for it.The fight among neighbours in Kalyan's Ajmera Heights started on Wednesday night when Shukla's wife Geeta lit incense and put it in the common corridor. The Marathi neighbours, Deshmukhs, objected. The Deshmukhs alleged that the Shukla family made comments about Marathi people for their non-vegetarian dietary habits.Dheeraj Deshmukh told TOI, ""When I objected to Shukla and his wife's remarks, they got angry. After the argument, we came back to the house."" He said after a while 8-10 people from outside the society knocked on his door, called him out, and began hitting him, during which his brother Abhijit too suffered head injuries. Alleging that Shukla took out a revolver from his pocket, he said that the family has intimidated other residents in the building in the past, saying he worked at Mantralaya. Deshmukh also accused Shukla of using an official blue beacon on his car. He said when he first went to the local police station to register a complaint, police were reluctant to record it, which forced him to take to social media.Shukla surrendered to Khadakpada police on Friday, while his associates, Darshan Borade and Sumit Jadhav, were arrested earlier. Shukla later issued a statement rebutting allegations by the Deshmukhs, saying it was a personal dispute and that he had made no remarks against Marathis in general.DCP Atul Zende said they are probing if Shukla had eligibility to use the beacon on his vehicle. Police have seized CCTV footage of the incident from the building. Police have also registered a cross-complaint against the Deshmukh family, in which Deshmukh has been accused of assault. Meanwhile, after news about a Marathi family being attacked went viral, MNS and Shiv Sena workers raised the issue and demanded action against the Shukla family.",An argument between two residents of a building in Kalyan over lighting of incense escalated into a Marathi vs non-Marathi dispute.

NEW DELHI: The winter session of Parliament saw differences within the INDIA bloc come to the fore with some regional parties differing openly with the Congress and some even questioning its leadership of the opposition alliance . The session saw the Congress navigating a tough path as the grand-old-party came under repeated attacks from the ruling NDA and also found itself isolated within the opposition's INDIA bloc on some key issues. At the end of it, it was the controversy over Amit Shah's Ambedkar remarks that once again united the Congress and other opposition parties as they protested together to corner the government.For the Congress, the impact of two disastrous electoral performances was evident as the grand-old-party came to Parliament losing the psychological advantage that had come with the Lok Sabha gains when it had almost doubled its tally.While the ruling NDA left no opportunity to corner the Congress over its shock defeats in Haryana and Maharashtra, INDIA bloc ally Mamata Banerjee slammed it's leadership and staked claim to lead the opposition alliance. Mamata got support from two top leaders of the alliance - NCP-SCP chief Sharad Pawar who called her a ""capable leader"" and RJD chief Lalu Prasad who said the West Bengal chief minister should be allowed to lead the opposition bloc. Lalu, an old time ally of the Congress, also made light of any objections that the grand-old-party may have over change of leadership. However, allies like DMK in Tamil Nadu and National Conference chief Omar Abdullah backed the Congress. When Trinamool cited Mamata's track record of defeating the BJP again and again in West Bengal, Congress leaders questioned her track record outside the state leading to a war of words between the allies.On the Adani US indictment issue, Congress did not get the support of two key regional leaders who refused to join the party-led protests. This was after Gautam Adani was charged by US prosecutors over his role in an alleged years-long scheme to pay $250 million bribe to Indian officials in exchange for favourable terms for solar power contracts. Rahul Gandhi once again led the charge and demanded that Gautam Adani should be arrested after his indictment in the US and accused the government of protecting him. But Akhilesh Yadav's Samajwadi Party insisted that the controversy in UP's Sambhal was far more important and distanced itself from INDIA bloc protests over the issue. Mamata's party, on the other hand, not just stayed away but also blamed the Congress along with the BJP for repeated adjournments of Parliament.However, several other allies of the Congress including AAP, RJD, Shiv Sena (UBT), DMK and the Left parties joined the protests against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and demanded accountability.Then came the issue of misuse of EVMs on which the Congress was again pushed to the corner by some of its own allies. Jammu and Kashmir CM Omar Abdullah advised the grand-old-party to not keep whining about the EVMs and at the same time, continue fighting elections. “The same EVMs gave you 99 seats. You celebrated that victory, but then you go on complaining about the same when you lose elections. You can’t be selective in blaming the EVMs,” he said.Trinamool Congress MP Abhishek Banerjee then rubbed salt on Congress's wounds as he said those raising questions on EVMs should give a demonstration of any ""discrepancies"" to the Election Commission. He went on to call the allegations made by some leaders as ""random statements.""""The people who raise questions about EVMs, if they have any evidence, should go and show a demo to the Election Commission. If the work is done properly during the EVM randomisation and the booth workers check during mock polls and counting, then I don't think there is any substance in these allegations,"" Abhishek Banerjee said.""If still someone feels that EVMs can be hacked, then they should meet the Election Commission and show how EVMs can be hacked... Nothing can be done by just making random statements,"" the TMC MP added. The Congress reacted strongly to the remarks of these allies and reminded them that it was not alone in doubting the EVMs.Then happened the Constitution debate in Parliament and the Congress once again come under vicious attack from the BJP and other partners of the ruling NDA, who accused the grand-old-party and the Gandhis of using the Constitution for their own benefit.While the Congress and other opposition leaders would have hoped to pin down the government over some of the recent incidents, the idea perhaps boomeranged as the BJP used the debate to unleash a scathing attack on the Congress reminding it of Emergency, Shah Bano case and several other constitutional amendments carried out under the party's rule. Prime Minister Narendra Modi not just cited these incidents but also alleged that the Congress had misused its own party constitution to target leaders who had differences with the Gandhis.However, much to the relief of Congress, at the end of the 4-day debate, Amit Shah's reference to Ambedkar in his concluding speech in Rajya Sabha gave the grand-old-party some ammunition to bounce back and aggressively attack the government.The Congress and other opposition parties joined hands to mount pressure on the government demanding an apology and resignation of Amit Shah. Prime Minister Modi, who led the defence against Shah, was also targeted for not taking action against his Cabinet minister.A face-off between the opposition and NDA MPs on the Parliament premises over the issue left two NDA leaders former minister Pratap Chandra Sarangi and Mukesh Rajput injured. After the incident, the BJP filed a police complaint against Rahul Gandhi, accusing him of ""physical assault and incitement"" and sought his indictment under sections of attempt to murder and other charges. The Congress, meanwhile, accused the BJP MPs of pushing its chief Mallikarjun Kharge and ""physically manhandling"" Gandhi. A delegation of Congress MPs, also filed a complaint visiting the police station in person.The last few days of the session saw a lot of drama with the Congress dominating the show. But the respite for the grand-old-party would be short-lived. Already, Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal has announced that it will not contest Delhi elections early next year in alliance with the Congress. In Bihar, where elections will be held towards the end of 2025 - the ties between Congress and RJD are already under strain. Clearly, the Congress needs to perform in elections and also put its house in order if it wants to continue to assert over its regional allies, many of whom are its political rivals in the states.","The winter session of Parliament saw differences within the INDIA bloc come to the fore.

"Chaotic winter session ends: Lok Sabha worked for 57% of the time, Rajya Sabha for 43%",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/chaotic-winter-session-ends-lok-sabha-worked-for-57-of-the-time-rajya-sabha-for-43/articleshow/116516764.cms,"Discord in House stark, just one bill has been passed in first 6 months of 18th Lok Sabha

NEW DELHI: Parliament's winter session, adjourned sine die on Friday, was one of the most tumultuous in recent memory, characterised by violence, protests and a significant drop in productivity.Despite the disruptions, the session introduced the one nation, one election bills and the two Houses held a two-day debate on 75 years of the Constitution. The session operated for roughly half its scheduled time, with Lok Sabha functioning for 57% of its scheduled time and Rajya Sabha for 43% (as of Dec 18).Dissatisfaction with the session was evident as Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla skipped the customary valedictory speech. Instead, he issued a stern warning just before 'Vande Mataram' was played to signify the session's end.Do not resort to demonstrations or protests at any gate or anywhere within the Parliament premises. Otherwise, the House will take serious action,"" Birla said amidst sloganeering by opposition MPs. ""It is improper to hold any protests or demonstrations at any of Parliament's gates. You must follow the rules in this regard. I urge you once again to take this warning seriously.""Birla adjourned Lok Sabha within three minutes without summarising the session's highlights. Notably, opposition leaders did not attend the traditional tea hosted by the Speaker, resulting in no photo release from the secretariat.PM Modi, defence minister Rajnath Singh, BJP president J P Nadda, parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju and leaders from other NDA parties assembled in Birla's chamber after the session was adjourned.The discord between the treasury and opposition sides was stark, with only one bill - Bharatiya Vayuyan Vidheyak - passed in the first six months of 18th Lok Sabha, marking the lowest legislative output in the last six terms according to PRS Legislative Research.The functioning of question hour in the winter session was severely hampered; in Rajya Sabha, it did not function for 15 out of 19 days while in Lok Sabha, it went on for more than 10 minutes on only eight out of 20 days. Also, there was no private members' business in Lok Sabha, and only one resolution was discussed in the upper House.In his closing remarks, Rajya Sabha chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar urged parties to transcend political differences and restore the dignity of parliamentary discourse, amid criticisms of partisanship from the opposition.The session hit its nadir with physical altercations on Thursday, involving MPs from rival parties, which resulted in two BJP members landing in hospital and an FIR against Rahul Gandhi. The session's highlight, however, was the two-day discussion on the 'Glorious Journey of 75 Years of the Constitution of India'.","Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla skipped the customary valedictory speech.

Sarangi, in what was obviously a well-planned manoeuvre, handed the bag to Priyanka. The Congress MP from Wayanad accepted the surprise ""gift"" from a political rival and thanked Sarangi.

"Ambedkar row turns physical; BJP, Congress trade accusations",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ambedkar-row-turns-physical-bjp-congress-trade-accusations/articleshow/116481958.cms,"No one’s admitting guilt. Parties blame each other for clash



NEW DELHI: The confrontation in Parliament over Ambedkar took an ugly turn Thursday as BJP and Congress MPs came face to face at the entrance of the new Parliament while accusing each other of insulting the Dalit icon.BJP's Lok Sabha MP Pratap Sarangi suffered a cut on his forehead and was taken to hospital along with colleague Mukesh Rajput. Both accused leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi of shoving his way through BJP MPs standing at the main entrance, Makar Dwar.Later, both sides filed complaints against each other. PTI reported, quoting sources, that LS Speaker Om Birla had banned demonstrations at any of the Parliament gates.The scuffle happened minutes before 11am when the two Houses were to gather for what would have been another stormy round. A big group of BJP MPs had gathered at the entrance to protest against Congress's alleged insult of Ambedkar. As Rahul reached, he decided to walk through the saffron column.Soon, Sarangi was seen tumbling and bleeding. He was also hurt in the knee. The 70-year-old MP from Balasore in Odisha, and his colleagues, said he suffered the injury after Rahul shoved Rajput who was standing next to him, bringing both of them down.Kya Rahul, kya? Aap ko sharam nahin aati hai, budhe ko gira diya (What Rahul, are you not ashamed of what you have done to an elderly member)?” BJP MP Nishikant Dubey was heard repeatedly shouting at Rahul as the Congress MP paused to look at Sarangi and Rajput.“What happened? I did not push him, he pushed me,” Rahul replied.Amid the welter of allegations and counter-allegations, Sarangi with a bleeding temple, and Rajput were rushed to RML Hospital. As doctors stitched Sarangi’s wound and ran a series of scans on him, defence minister Rajnath Singh and agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and others visited the hospital to check on them. PM Modi spoke with the two MPs. In a statement, RML Hospital said Sarangi was profusely bleeding when he was brought in.With BJP accusing Rahul of physical violence and goonish behaviour, Congress members wrote to LS Speaker Om Birla alleging that the LoP had been manhandled by three BJP MPs.They also alleged that BJP MPs had shoved party chief Mallikarjun Kharge.Ministers and BJP MPs, however, pressed with the charge that Rahul was the instigator. They said that faced with similar protests from Congress MPs who have been regularly blocking the entrance on a range of issues for years, BJP parliamentarians would take the passage created by security personnel to help them sidestep the opposition MPs.At a press conference later, Kharge said BJP was trying to divert attention from home minister Amit Shah’s remarks on Ambedkar.Both Houses were adjourned soon after they assembled, and then again at 2pm for the day when Congress and other opposition parties continued their protest demanding an apology and resignation of home minister Amit Shah.Speaking to reporters, parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju said, “BJP MPs were protesting outside the Parliament gate where Rahul Gandhi with a few of his MPs physically assaulted them, who were peacefully protesting against falsehoods being spread against Amit Shah on the Ambedkar issue.”He said the entire incident was recorded on CCTV cameras and everyone saw that Rahul physically attacked NDA MPs.","BJP's Lok Sabha MP Pratap Sarangi suffered a cut on his forehead and was taken to hospital along with colleague Mukesh Rajput.

'Invitees list given by Shashi Tharoor': Hardeep Puri on 2009 dinner with George Soros,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/invitees-list-given-by-shashi-tharoor-hardeep-puri-on-2009-dinner-with-george-soros/articleshow/116523193.cms,"Hardeep Puri and Shashi Tharoor (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Friday hit back at Congress MP Shashi Tharoor 's claims regarding a 2009 dinner in New York attended by US billionaire George Soros . Puri, who was India's ambassador to the United Nations at the time, hosted the dinner where Tharoor, then minister of state, was a guest.Puri responded to Tharoor’s recent post on X, saying that it was Tharoor who provided the list of invitees for the dinner, which included Soros. ""In retrospect, it is clear the name was included because the gentleman in question was among the benefactors of the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation , and the minister of state was keen to meet him,"" Puri wrote.He also added that Tharoor had previously met Soros in May 2009 and tweeted about the interaction. ""Language has frequently been accorded pride of place amongst the arts of deception. Some of my friends in the Congress Party excel in obfuscation; but they tweet at their own peril,"" Puri said, taking a dig at Tharoor.""Since I was just a few months old in the city then, but Dr Tharoor had spent considerable time in New York, I did not choose the list of invitees for the dinner. It was given to me by minister Tharoor,"" the Union minister added.The controversy arose after a BJP worker highlighted a 2009 tweet in which Tharoor referred to Soros as an ""old friend"" and praised his interest in India. In response, Tharoor clarified that he met Soros socially and had no ongoing relationship with him.In his post on X, Tharoor said that the meeting took place at a formal dinner hosted by Puri during his visit to New York. ""Ambassador Puri had invited a number of prominent Americans for a dinner discussion with me, and that was entirely appropriate,"" Tharoor wrote. He emphasised that he had not been in contact with Soros since the event and denied ever seeking or receiving funds from him or his foundations.BJP's annoyance with Soros, who has made no secret of his dislike for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and has included him in the list of targets, which also include US President-elect Donald Trump, is not new. It has also accused him of working in league with Congress.The BJP has accused the Congress party of collaborating with George Soros, a billionaire investor, and his affiliated organisations to spread misinformation and disrupt Parliament. The BJP cites French media outlet Mediapart's claims about Soros's funding of Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and its alleged ties to the US government as evidence.","Hardeep Singh Puri hits back at Congress MP Shashi Tharoor's claims regarding a 2009 dinner in New York attended by US billionaire George Soros.
