PATNA: Bihar police uncovered a cache of burned banknotes amounting to Rs 2.75 lakh in Rs 100 and Rs 500 denominations, along with NEET and NEET-PG admit cards, from a hostel room at Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH) late Wednesday. Also found during the search were an MBBS OMR sheet from Aryabhatta Knowledge University and a liquor bottle.The discovery of admit cards raises concerns about the NEET scam in Bihar and Jharkhand. Several people, including students and coaching centre operators, have been taken into custody for their alleged links to the scam, which involved impersonation, manipulation of OMR sheets, and other malpractices to secure admissions in medical colleges.PMCH principal Dr Vidyapati Choudhary filed an FIR Thursday. According to police, the room located on the ground floor of Chanakya Hostel was occupied by Dr Ajay Singh from Samastipur, who completed his post-graduation last year. Singh is currently ""absconding. The discovery came after a fire broke out around 10pm Wednesday in a room occupied by Singh. It appears the documents and notes were burned during the fire and subsequently dumped in the ground-floor room, police said.Earlier that evening, another case involving Singh occurred. ""Around 5.30pm, we received information that a doctor was assaulted by junior students and locked in a room. A police team found Singh in room 625 on the sixth floor. He reported being beaten by juniors but declined to press charges,"" the SHO said. The hostel warden said, ""Singh had occupied two to three rooms. While we can issue notices, it is the administration's responsibility to enforce evictions.""","Bihar police uncovered a cache of burned banknotes amounting to Rs 2.75 lakh in Rs 100 and Rs 500 denominations, along with NEET and NEET-PG admit cards.

JAMMU: Amid the rumblings in INDIA bloc over AAP and Congress contesting Delhi assembly elections separately, National Conference president Farooq Abdullah and his son and J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah are speaking in different voices over the issue.While Omar on Thursday lamented lack of clarity on the opposition bloc’s future, and suggested winding it up if it was meant only for Lok Sabha elections, Abdullah senior, just hours later, asserted that the alliance “is permanent…it is for every day and every moment”. “The alliance is not just about contesting elections. It is about strengthening India and eliminating hatred,” he told reporters in Jammu.“Those who believe this alliance was only for parliamentary elections should come out of this misconception,” Farooq added. It was not clear if he was referring to Omar’s remarks or to Tejashwi Yadav’s comments.Farooq also rejected criticism against Omar that he was acting as a “Centre’s man”, and stressed that as the CM, the latter had to cooperate with the Union govt for J&K’s welfare. Responding to recent remarks by party MP Aga Rahullah, Farooq said, “Let him (Aga) say what he thinks, but Omar Abdullah is the people’s chief minister. He is not working on anyone’s directives.

ECI orders Delhi's chief electoral officer to set inquiry over AAP's allegation

NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convenor and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday met Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar and doubled down on serious allegations of electoral malpractice in the New Delhi Assembly constituency , accusing the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of orchestrating a ""big scam"" to manipulate voters and influence the upcoming Delhi elections.The Election Commission has asked the Chief Electoral Officer of Delhi to inquire about the complaints made by AAP and file an action-taken report.Kejriwal represents the New Delhi constituency. He will be up against BJP's Parvesh Verma and Congress's Sandeep Dikshit in the assembly elections that will be held on February 5.Reacting to the allegations, Delhi BJP chief Virendra Sachdeva said Kejriwal was aware that he would lose the upcoming polls. ""A student who feels he is about to fail the exam goes and complains to those above him. He [Kejriwal] knows the exam will be tough and what is coming. He has stopped talking about Delhi and is focussing on only his own constituency of New Delhi.""Addressing a press conference, Kejriwal claimed that thousands of fake applications for vote cancellations and additions had been filed in the constituency in recent weeks and pointed the finger at BJP candidate from the seat Parvesh Verma.Earlier in the day, Kejriwal along with CM Atishi and other top AAP leaders, met the Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar and discussed ""concerns"" regarding alleged irregularities in the polls.""In the New Delhi Assembly constituency, from December 15 to January 7, in 22 days, 5,500 applications have come for cancellation of votes. These applications are fake,"" Kejriwal alleged.He said that when officials investigated the matter and contacted the individuals whose votes were reportedly being cancelled, they found that these applications had been filed without their knowledge.""A big scam is going on,"" he added.Kejriwal further accused BJP candidate Parvesh Verma of organising job camps and openly distributing cash to influence voters.""Where did all these people come from in just 15 days? These people are coming from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar to get fake votes registered. Thirdly, we pointed out that Parvesh Verma in the New Delhi seat is openly distributing money, and health camps are being held with glasses being distributed. He announced on January 15 that job fairs will be held. All of this falls under corrupt practices according to the Election Commission's rules. Parvesh Verma should be barred from contesting the election,"" he said.The AAP convenor called for stringent action against Verma, demanding that he be barred from contesting the elections and that his residence be raided.""The Election Commission of India must ensure that such practices are stopped immediately. The local election officer of the New Delhi Assembly constituency has surrendered to the BJP and is facilitating all the wrong works of the BJP. The local DEO and ERO should be suspended,"" Kejriwal urged.Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann also weighed in on the controversy, expressing faith in the ECI. ""We trust that the ECI will take strict action against the officers of the New Delhi Assembly constituency and also on the deletion and addition of votes. ECI is our last hope. It is the responsibility of the ECI to save democracy,"" Mann said.The allegations have sparked a political storm, with AAP urging immediate intervention by the ECI to prevent further violations. Taking to X, AAP shared a letter addressed to chief election commissioner ""to highlight a large number of voter additions and deletions in the New Delhi assembly.""According to the post, Delhi CM Atishi has also demanded that ""verification of the authenticity of objectors should be carried out before the exercise of voter deletion is done.""The letter includes the data of applications submitted for voter deletions and additions.Later in the day, Kejriwal's remarks -- ""people are coming from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar to get fake votes registered"" sparked controversy. Taking aim at Kejriwal, BJP leader Manoj Tiwari said that the AAP national convenor is disrespecting residents of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh living in the national capital.""Arvind Kejriwal and AAP have a history of disrespecting migrants from UP, Bihar, and Jharkhand. Intentions often reveal themselves naturally. I want to ask Arvind Kejriwal, how dare you call the people of Purvanchal, UP, and Bihar fake? You (Arvind Kejriwal) and (AAP) promises are fake,"" he said.BJP national president J P Nadda also criticised Kejriwal for allegedly disrespecting residents of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar by labelling them as fake voters. Nadda posted two video recordings of Kejriwal's statements on X, including an older clip and one from Thursday following an AAP team's visit to the Election Commission.""In fear of his defeat after looting Delhi for the past 10 years with his massive corruption and turning into a disaster for the city, Arvind Kejriwal in desperation has resorted to baseless comments against brothers and sisters of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar,"" the BJP leader alleged.""People of Delhi will surely reply to him by throwing him out of power,"" he added.Following AAP's uproar over alleged electoral malpractice in the New Delhi Assembly constituency, the ECI asked chief electoral officer of Delhi to inquire about the complaint of AAP, ascertain the facts and take immediate appropriate action in accordance with the Model Code of Conduct.","Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convenor and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday met Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar.

Each of the injured will get Rs 2 lakh as compensation. The CM pulled up TTD officials and police officers over lack of planning and crowd management.Preliminary investigation indicated that a senior police officer opened the main gate of the park, where the makeshift queue lines were set up, to allow an old woman devotee to move out after she complained of ill health. The ill-planned opening of the gate led to a sudden surge of devotees, who had been waiting for over 12 hours by then, towards the gate, leading to the stampede.Officials clarified on Thursday that the stampede was not a result of the opening of the gate to issue tokens before the scheduled hour. TTD had earlier announced that it would issue tokens for free darshan from 5 am on Thursday. In anticipation, thousands of devotees had stood in long queues from 8 am on Wednesday, 21 hours before the scheduled opening of the token issuing counters. However, following the stampede at around 8.03 pm on Wednesday, officials began issuing tokens at around 11 pm. It continued till 10 am on Thursday when the general darshan quota of 1.2 lakh tokens was completed.The state govt suspended DSP Ramana Kumar and TTD dairy farm director Haranadh Reddy for dereliction of duty.
