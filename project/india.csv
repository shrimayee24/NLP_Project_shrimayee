For MVA, Shiv Sena (UBT) won 20, Congress 16, and NCP (SP) 10 seats.Though Thackeray's party won the maximum seats among the MVA partners, 18 of its candidates failed to secure the second position. Its candidate from Nandgaon in Nashik district, Ganesh Dhatrak, finished fourth. Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena's Suhas Kande won the seat. Even an independent, Rohan Borse, was ahead of Dhatrak, finishing third.Among the other seats, Sena (UBT)'s pick from Airoli, Manohar Madhavi, finished third. He was in a direct fight with BJP's Ganesh Naik, who emerged the winner. In Kalyan Rural, Thackeray's candidate, Subhash Bhoir, finished third against Sena's Rajesh More. MNS's Pramod Patil was the runner-up.Congress candidates finished third in Warora, Vasai, Solapur City Central, Aurangabad East, Amalner, and Achalpur.Five candidates of NCP (SP)were pushed to the third slot in Pandharpur, Morshi, Chandgad, Ashti, and Aheri.For Mahayuti, not a single BJP candidate finished third. Six Shiv Sena candidates and three NCP nominees, however, ended up in the third position.","MVA's confidence about forming govt in Maharashtra crushed by Mahayuti juggernaut.

"Jharkhand polls: Kurmis went with Tiger, hurt BJP",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jharkhand-polls-kurmis-went-with-tiger-hurt-bjp/articleshow/115641519.cms,"JLKM and its Jairam Mahato, representing OBC Kurmi community , walked away with a sizeable chunk of traditional NDA voters, disrupting the alliance's bid to return to office in the tribal-dominated state.The three-way division proved beneficial for JMM and its partners in 13 seats, where JLKM's vote count exceeded winning margins. Even as BJP has made inroads among OBC voters in several states, it remains a challenge for the party in Jharkhand, where Kurmis are the biggest OBC constituent.Winning over the community was outsourced to AJSU's Sudesh Mahto, who lost from Silli on Ranchi's outskirts, signalling his waning popularity.While JLKM secured victory in only one out of the 71 seats it contested, its impact was felt across several constituencies, influencing the election outcome in favour of INDIA bloc parties. Jairam Mahato, popularly known as 'Tiger', polled 94,496 votes in Dumri, significantly outdistancing AJSU's Yashoda Devi, who received 35,890 votes.","JLKM and its Jairam Mahato, representing OBC Kurmi community, walked away with a sizeable chunk of traditional NDA voters.

The truck driver fled the scene, leaving the vehicle behind.Police said Vishakha Tripathi and the others were travelling from Mathura to her Dwarka home in Delhi when the truck crashed into their vehicles from behind.Those injured were her sisters - Krishana Tripathi (67) and Shyama Tripathi (69) - their driver Sanjay Malik (57) from Pratapgarh; and acquaintances Hansha Patel (56), Kashmira Patel (53), and Januka Khadka (40), all residents of Mathura; and Deepak Patel (35) from Delhi.Arvind Kumar, ACP (Greater Noida-3), said a passerby called to inform police about the accident.A team reached the accident spot from Dankaur police station in a while and brought the occupants out of the mangled cars.

As their condition deteriorated, the injured passengers were transferred to a private hospital in New Delhi.Police are trying to find out if reduced visibility because of fog caused the accident. There is speculation that the driver of the truck may have fallen asleep at the wheel. The stretch of the expressway where the accident occurred is not covered by CCTV cameras.""We haven't received any complaint yet, but have launched a comprehensive investigation to determine the cause of the accident.

NEW DELHI: The vote counting for the Maharashtra assembly elections is underway, with early trends hinting at a fierce battle between the Mahayuti alliance and the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA). The Mahayuti, comprising the BJP, Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena, and Ajit Pawar’s NCP, is pitted against the MVA coalition of Congress, Shiv Sena (UBT), and Sharad Pawar-led NCP.Maharashtra’s 288 constituencies witnessed a voter turnout of 66.05%, reflecting increased public participation compared to 2019.Both alliances remain optimistic, interpreting the higher turnout as a sign of support for their respective coalitions.Key contests are drawing significant attention, including Deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis’s fight in Nagpur South West and a high-stakes battle in Wadala, where Shiv Sena (UBT)’s Shraddha Jadhav expressed confidence in her victory.As counting progresses, leads are emerging, with the Mahayuti gaining a landslide margin of over 220 seats in several constituencies.",Shahada (2) - Rajesh Udesing Padvi Nandurbar (3) - Dr. Vijaykumar Krushanrao Gavit Dhule Rural (6) - Raghavendra (Ramdada) Manohar Patil Dhule City (7) - Agrawal Anupbhaiyya Omprakash Sindkheda (8) - Jaykumar Jitendrasingh Rawal Shirpur (9),"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115585397,imgsize-938489,width-400,resizemode-4/115585397.jpg"

We will study the reasons for the debacle and take necessary steps,"" Sharad Pawar said.He also said that the opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), which his party is part of, should have worked more for the state polls.""We (MVA) were more confident after Lok Sabha results; it seems we needed to work more,"" Sharad Pawar was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.He also defended his decision to field Yugendra Pawar against his estranged nephew Ajit Pawar in Bharamati, saying ""someone had to contest"".""Fielding Yugendra Pawar against Ajit Pawar in Baramati wasn't a wrong decision; someone had to contest,"" Sharad Pawar said in Karad.""There can be no comparison between Ajit Pawar and Yugendra Pawar,"" he said.He further said: ""No qualms in accepting Ajit Pawar got more seats in Maharashtra polls, but everyone knows who is the NCP founder.""Sharad Pawar's self-proclaimed swansong in electoral politics ended in a damp squib with his nephew's NCP winning more than 4x the seats that his own party could muster.In retaliation for Ajit's decision to field his wife against Pawar's daughter Supriya Sule, the Maratha warhorse had turned the Baramati contest again into a prestige fight, pitching Ajit's nephew against him.The gambit didn't pay off. Ajit's NCP has upped its score from a mere six assembly segment leads in the Lok Sabha results to a tally of 41 MLAs, in the process beating the senior Pawar's nominees in 27 head-to-head clashes; the latter won 7 of those contests.Ajit has extended his sway over western Maharashtra (22 seats), Marathwada (10) and Vidarbha (5) while the majority of seats the senior Pawar held on to are all in western Maharashtra.In the Maharashtra assembly elections, Mahayuti achieved a significant victory by winning 230 seats out of the total 288 constituencies. The BJP emerged as the largest party with 132 seats, whilst their coalition partners performed well - chief minister Eknath Shinde's Shiv Sena secured 57 seats, and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar's NCP obtained 41 seats in the state assembly.","Sharad Pawar says election results ""were not on expected lines"" and that he would ""study reasons and go to the people"" NCP(SP) chief acknowledged that ""women's participation in large numbers could be a reason for Mahayuti sweep in polls""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115628080,imgsize-644709,width-400,resizemode-4/115628080.jpg"

He almost faced a daring defeat if not for the namesake candidate of MVA nominee Nikam. While Walse Patil won by a wafer-thin margin of 1,523 votes, MVA's Nikam probably lost some votes to his namesake independent candidate, who came in third with 2,965 votes.This time, 17 candidates from Mahayuti and MVA faced one or more namesakes in their constituencies in four southern districts.The story was similar for 12 prominent candidates in the north.In Karjat Jamkhed, NCP (SP)'s Rohit Pawar and BJP's Ram Shinde faced their namesakes putting up a fight. Rohit won by a slender margin of 1,243 votes, while his namesake bagged 3,489 votes and came third. In the case of BJP's Shinde, his two namesakes polled nearly 500 votes.","Dilip Walse Patil, the eight-time MLA from Ambegaon constituency, was pitted against two Devdatta Nikams.

Electoral results

Party’s response

NEW DELHI: AJSU Party 's lone MLA, Nirmal Mahto , on Sunday offered to resign from his Mandu seat to make way for party chief Sudesh Mahto , who lost the polls from Silli constituency. This comes after the AJSU Party, a BJP ally, contested 10 seats in the Jharkhand Assembly elections but secured only one, with a narrow margin of 231 votes.“I have sent my resignation letter to Sudesh Mahto, requesting him to accept it so that he can contest from Mandu in the bypoll and enter the assembly,” said Nirmal Mahto, who defeated Congress candidate Jai Prakash Bhai Patel by a slender margin in Mandu.In Mandu, Nirmal Mahto secured 90,871 votes, while Patel garnered 90,640. Interestingly, Patel had contested the 2019 elections as a BJP candidate and defeated Mahto with a margin of about 2,000 votes. However, after switching to the Congress, the BJP ceded the Mandu seat to the AJSU Party for this election.Meanwhile, Sudesh Mahto faced a significant defeat in Silli, losing to JMM’s Amit Kumar by a margin of 23,867 votes.Jaleshwar Mahato, AJSU Party's central committee secretary, confirmed that Sudesh Mahto has received the resignation letter and will make a decision soon.The AJSU Party’s poor performance in these elections highlights the challenges faced by smaller allies in coalition politics. A bypoll in Mandu could serve as a critical opportunity for Sudesh Mahto to re-establish his presence in the assembly.","AJSU Party's lone MLA, Nirmal Mahto, offered to resign from his Mandu seat to make way for party chief Sudesh Mahto.

Devendra Fadnavis: Will he be back in 2024 after being so-near-yet-so-far in 2019?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/devendra-fadnavis-will-he-be-back-in-2024-after-being-so-near-yet-so-far-in-2019/articleshow/115617326.cms,"Despite leading the BJP to a historic victory in the Maharashtra assembly elections and a previous promise to return as Chief Minister, Devendra Fadnavis's future role hangs in the balance.

In 2019, he famously said: “Me Punha Yein” (I’ll be back). In 2024, he’s maintaining a diplomatic silence even as everyone’s wondering: “Toh Punha Yeil ka?” (Will he be back?).Simple math should yield a resounding yes. BJP’s numbers are more than double of Shiv Sena’s. Logically it’s a no contest. But politics is not about hard numbers alone and with Shinde camp dropping enough hints that status quo should prevail it’s to be seen whether the man from Nagpur will head to Mantralaya as CM or not.Fadnavis played a stellar role in leading the tripartite alliance to victory.While everyone focused on the bold numbers of LS polls of barely six months ago, he zeroed in on the granular details. Mahayuti’s vote share was a mere one per cent lower than MVA’s. If only two lakh more voters had voted for them, the picture would have been very different.It is precisely with this emphasis on smart poll management that Fadnavis, with a quiet resolve, went about planning the BJP’s election campaign and at the same time performing his role as Dy CM. Finally, he has returned, with a big bang – the BJP has posted its highest seat tally ever in Maharashtra with 132 seats.Fadnavis has, indeed, a point or two to prove. In 2019, the then CM Fadnavis had been BJP’s face for the state election campaign. He had even led the party’s Mahajanadesh yatra and made the famous ‘Me Punha Yein’ statement. It turned out to be quite a millstone around his neck, and he has been hoping for five years that he’d be able to cast it away.He helped BJP leadership engineer splits in the Shiv Sena and later in NCP and took it on the chin when he was appointed deputy to Eknath Shinde. His initial reluctance to be Shinde’s deputy was very visible. But like a loyal party worker he fell in line swallowing his ego and pride. All he did after that perceived diminishing of stature was to get back to work so that he could bounce back. He must be now hoping that the BJP top brass take cognizance of both his ‘sacrifice’ and subjucation of his claims to the chief ministership in the interests of the party and reward him with the top job five years around. His mother was quite vocal about her son’s credentials for the job post results.During the Maratha quota agitation, he was personally and consistently targeted by quota activist Manoj Jarange over his ‘Brahmin’ credentials. Though the LS poll debacle was a serious setback he led an aggressive assembly campaign, describing the state election as a ‘dharmayuddh.’This combination of silent, steady work with strong pronouncements has brought him back into the reckoning for the CM’s post, again. It is now up to the BJP supremos to decide whether to reward their tallest leader with the top job or, again, sacrifice Fadnavis for Shinde for the greater good of BJP in the longer term.",Fadnavis played a stellar role in leading the tripartite alliance to victory.

DK Shivakumar hints at BJP support in Congress’s Channapatna bypoll victory,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/dk-shivakumar-hints-at-bjp-support-in-congresss-channapatna-bypoll-victory/articleshow/115643792.cms,"DK Shivakumar and Laxmi Hebbalkar at a women’s awareness conference in Kanakapura on Sunday

BENGALURU: Congress state president DK Shivakumar , also deputy CM, set the cat among the pigeons by suggesting local BJP functionaries — and JD(S) cadres too — in Channapatna had lent support for CP Yogeeshwara , ensuring his win in the byelection to the assembly seat.Just ahead of the election, Yogeeshwara walked out of BJP and joined Congress which promptly made him the candidate.On Sunday, a day after Yogeeshwara was declared winner by more than 25,000 votes, Shivakumar thanked local BJP functionaries indicating that they had backed their former partyman.Amid talk of senior JD(S) MLA GT Devegowda hinting at joining Congress, Shivakumar said Congress barely secured 15,000 votes in the previous assembly elections, but the tally went up in the Lok Sabha polls. “Could we have won this election if BJP members had not supported us? We got a lot of votes in this election as we received direct and indirect support from JD(S) workers and functionaries too,” he said.Pointing to former BJP deputy chief minister CN Ashwath Narayan’s remark that he knew Yogeeshwara would win, Shivakumar said: “Is he dumb to say so having been a minister in charge of the district and deputy chief minister? He knew the pulse of people.”Meanwhile, NDA alliance stuck to the narrative that the loss was due to “huge money” Congress “distributed” in the segment. Opposition leader R Ashoka, in a post on social media, said chief minister Siddaramaiah and Congress might be “patting their backs on the victory” but it was basically “money power” that propelled the win.He went on to say Congress winning three seats was nothing compared to BJP’s “feat” of winning 17 of the 18 byelections in 2019 and predicted Congress’ defeat in the next assembly elections. However, Union steel and heavy industries minister HD Kumaraswamy of JD(S) refused to comment on the loss of his son Nikhil, in Channapatna.“The results were announced yesterday. There is no point in talking about it. We must bow to the mandate of the people,” he said.","Congress state president DK Shivakumar suggests local BJP functionaries — and JD(S) cadres too — in Channapatna had lent support for CP Yogeeshwara.
