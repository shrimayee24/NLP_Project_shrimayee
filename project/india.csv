MUMBAI: After weeklong parleys marked by a series of confrontations between Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut and MPCC president Nana Patole, Maha Vikas Aghadi on Tuesday evening reached a consensus on seat-sharing for the assembly elections. If a senior Congress politician is to be believed, Congress will contest 105 seats, UBT Shiv Sena 95 and Sharad Pawar-led NC 84, while a few seats will be given to Samajwadi Party and PWP.Maharashtra assembly has a total of 288 seats. The Mahayuti formula is also in the final stages, with BJP likely to contest between 150 and 155 seats, CM Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena 78-80 and Ajit Pawar-led NCP 52-54 seats.The dispute in the MVA over seat allocation was finally resolved following the intervention of the soft-spoken Congress legislature party leader Balasaheb Thorat, who was deployed by AICC president Mallikarjun Kharge to handle matters.The senior Congress functionary said that in Mumbai, it is expected that the UBT Sena will contest 18 seats, Congress 14 and NCP (SP) 2. The row over three seats in Mumbai - Versova, Bandra East and Byculla - is yet to be resolved as both UBT Sena and Congress have staked claim. ""We will resolve the dispute either tonight or on Wednesday, the UBT Shiv Sena or Congress will have to sacrifice, only then will the dispute be resolved,"" Congress neta said late Tuesday evening.After its success in the Lok Sabha elections, where MVA won 31 seats, at least 25 meetings were held to discuss the seat-sharing formula for the assembly elections. While a consensus was reached on nearly 240 seats, there has been no end to the row over 12 seats in the Vidarbha region, where both Congress and UBT Sena have staked claim, and the three seats in the city.At several meetings, sources said, tempers ran so high that at one stage, MPCC president Nana Patole and Sanjay Raut had a sharp exchange of words, and it was also felt at that point that it might be better if all the constituents fought the elections separately and joined hands after the elections. The dispute then reached the AICC, where Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge pacified the warring factions and deputed Thorat to resolve the matter.","Congress will contest 105 seats, UBT Shiv Sena 95 and Sharad Pawar-led NC 84.

NEW DELHI: After much suspense, Sebi chairperson Madhabi Buch is scheduled to appear before the Public Accounts Committee of Parliament on Thursday, a meeting that on agenda is slated to be a performance review of the top regulator, but which may result in fireworks over its functioning as well as about the recent allegations of impropriety levelled against Buch.Well-placed sources said Buch had sought an exemption from the PAC, but was denied. They said she should be present before the committee.The agenda of the committee's meeting is ""briefing by audit followed by oral evidence of the representatives of ministry of finance and Sebi on the subject 'performance review of regulatory bodies established by Act of Parliament'.""When the summons were issued to Buch for appearance this month, BJP protested the decision of the PAC headed by Congress MP and AICC general secretary KC Venugopal, and attributed political motives to his move. BJP members had also written a letter to the Lok Sabha Speaker protesting the summons. However, the issue appears to have settled in favour of the PAC summons.Sources said BJP has issued a whip to its members to attend the meeting, and protests against opposition members on their line of questioning may be in the offing. Though the said agenda is limited to the Sebi's functioning, political leaders believe that the Sebi chief headed team may be subjected to questions about the regulator's functioning, which gained prominence over the issue of industrialist Adani in the wake of the allegations levelled by US short-seller Hindenburg .Also, specific questions could be asked to Buch about allegations of financial misconduct and of conflict of interest. While the charges against Buch were first levelled by Hindenburg, they were followed up by various whistleblowers, and by the opposition led by Congress, triggering a political storm. Buch and her husband have rebutted the allegations.","Madhabi Buch is scheduled to appear before the Public Accounts Committee of Parliament on Thursday.

The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections , which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases. The results will be declared on November 23, along with Maharashtra.In the Tribal-dominated state, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and CM Hemant's Soren Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) are in a direct fight, while the Congress party and Lalu Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) are in alliance with the JMM.The JMM-Congress-RJD alliance are also reportedly seeking to deal with Left parties, Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party and other tribal outfits that have been contesting the elections in the state as independent entities and make efforts to field candidates against the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) on all 81 seats collectively.In the last assembly polls in 2019, the JMM-Congress-RJD alliance won a comfortable majority of 47 seats in a House of 81.The BJP slipped to 25 seats from 37 it held in 2014. The poor performance was perceived to be the outcome of its decision to contest alone backfiring. The party did not foster an alliance with the Ajsu in the 2019 polls when Raghubar Das, currently the Odisha governor, was serving the state as CM.In this year's Lok Sabha polls in Jharkhand, the BJP-led NDA secured nine out of the 14 seats, with the BJP winning eight and its alliance partner, the Ajsu (All Jharkhand Students Union) Party, retaining its single seat.On the other hand, the opposition India bloc improved its tally, increasing its seat count from two in 2019 to five in the parliamentary polls.BJP and JMM have spruced up their pace of campaigning from the ground zero to social media. BJP and JMM leaders are actively rebutting and challenging each other on a range of issues, including illegal immigration, youth welfare, employment and housing.INDIA bloc parties in Jharkhand slammed the EC for holding assembly elections in the state along with that of Maharashtra but claimed that they were ready to slug it out with BJP-led NDA, which has welcomed the announcement of poll dates.JMM, Congress, and CPI (ML-L) said the announcement showed that EC was in a hurry to conduct elections though the assembly tenure was due to end in January next year.Also, both the INDIA bloc and BJP-led NDA are expected to get into huddles to discuss the modalities of seat-sharing which is going to be a challenge for both the competing teams.","The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections, which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra. Elections in Maharashtra will be held in single phase on November 20. The counting of votes will be on November 23.Maharashtra is gearing up for elections as the two major political alliances—the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) and the Mahayuti—prepare to face each other for the first time in a Vidhan Sabha election.The Maha Vikas Aghadi, comprise of the Congress, the Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray), and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) under Sharad Pawar, will go head-to-head with the Mahayuti , which includes the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Shiv Sena faction led by Eknath Shinde, and the NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar. This will be the first electoral contest between these two alliances since the splits within the Shiv Sena and NCP.The MVA is hopeful of replicating its recent Lok Sabha success, while the Mahayuti aims to retain power by leveraging its populist schemes targeted at women and youth. Both alliances have set their sights on winning the state.Narayan Rane, a former Union Minister and the victor in the Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg Lok Sabha constituency, is poised to be a key figure for the BJP in the Konkan region during the forthcoming elections. Meanwhile, two constituencies are expected to be critical battlegrounds: chief minister Eknath Shinde's Kopri-Pachpakdi seat in Thane City and Worli in Mumbai, where Aaditya Thackeray, a leader of the Shiv Sena (UBT), is seeking reelection.In the last Vidhan Sabha elections in 2019, the BJP secured 26.1% of the votes, the Congress 16.1%, the NCP 16.9%, and the Shiv Sena 16.6%. The BJP and the Shiv Sena (then united) formed the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which secured a majority. However, the coalition soon crumbled due to disagreements over government formation, plunging the state into a political crisis.After no party could establish a government, Maharashtra was placed under President's rule. Devendra Fadnavis was briefly sworn in as chief minister, with Ajit Pawar as deputy chief minister. However, both resigned just days later before a scheduled floor test.By November 28, 2019, a new coalition emerged, with the Shiv Sena (Uddhav faction), NCP (Sharad Pawar faction), and Congress forming the Maha Vikas Aghadi government, led by Uddhav Thackeray as chief minister.The state's politics took another turn in June, 2022, when Uddhav Thackeray resigned following a rebellion within the Shiv Sena, led by Eknath Shinde, who then allied with the BJP. Eknath Shinde assumed the role of chief minister, with Devendra Fadnavis returning as deputy chief minister.",The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra.
