""Somebody is instigating him to make such statements,"" he said.The confrontation on something as innocuous as pro-tem speaker is seen as important as it is reflective of the aggression that Congress might show in Parliament as well as govt's intent to stand its ground. Who gets to function as pro-tem speaker has never been an issue. It is a non-partisan role and whoever gets to perform it fades into oblivion almost as soon as a regular speaker takes over.Rijiju said in 2004, Balasaheb Vikhe-Patil was made pro-tem speaker although he was an eight-time MP while Atal Bihari Vajpayee, being a 10-time MP, was the senior-most and George Fernandes and Girdhar Gamang were nine-time MPs. ""But Patil was made pro-tem speaker and three seniors were ignored. There have been several such examples in the past,"" he said.""Moreover, there is a SC ruling that making the senior-most MP pro-tem speaker is not a binding,"" he said.Rijiju urged other opposition parties to avoid toeing Congress's line.

Halt and review laws anew: Mamata Banerjee to PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/halt-and-review-laws-anew-mamata-banerjee-to-pm-modi/articleshow/111176000.cms,"File photo

Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee has written to PM Narendra Modi asking for deferment of the three ""unilaterally"" passed criminal laws set to be rolled out from July 1. Mamata's letter says the laws were passed ""ignoring"" dissent notes and, more importantly, by ""unethically"" expelling 146 members from Parliament. Mamata's letter was sent Thursday, four days before the new Parliament 's session begins Monday. The letter also follows her meeting with Congress stalwart P Chidambaram in Kolkata Thursday. INDIA allies Trinamool , Congress and DMK have consistently objected to the new laws. In her letter, Mamata urged the PM to ""halt and review the whole subject anew"" and to consider ""at least a deferment of the implementation date"", citing ""ethical and practical"" reasons. The letter said it would ""ethically"" be proper to debate and scrutinise the ""significant legislative changes"" afresh in Parliament.

J&K assembly polls are to be held before the Sep 30 deadline set by the Supreme Court , with chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar already having announced EC's intent to conduct them soon.PM Narenda Modi on Thursday had assured the people in Jammu and Kashmir that elections were not very far off. The poll announcement, however, may come only after Amarnath Yatra winds up on Aug 19, and the publication of the final roll for J&K on Aug 20 will pave the way for this.The term of the state assemblies in Haryana, Maharashtra and Jharkhand are expiring on Nov 3, Nov 26 and Jan 5 respectively.

NEW DELHI: Delhi's Rouse Avenue Court on Thursday granted bail to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on a bond of Rs 1 lakh in the money laundering case related to the alleged excise policy case. The court also declined Enforcement Directorate (ED) prayer to stay the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader's bail order for 48 hours.Kejriwal has been in jail since March 21 and was granted bail for a short period to campaign for his party during the Lok Sabha elections held last month.The court, however, imposed conditions on the bail, including prohibiting him from hampering the investigation or influencing witnesses. Kejriwal has been instructed to appear before the court whenever required and to cooperate with the investigation.Special Judge Niyay Bindu issued the order after listening to arguments from both the prosecution and the defence counsel. On Wednesday, Kejriwal's judicial custody had been extended until July 3.The judge had reserved the order earlier in the day after hearing arguments from the ED, which sought to link Kejriwal to the alleged proceeds of crime and co-accused individuals. The defense argued that the prosecution lacked evidence to substantiate claims against the AAP leader.ED will now move Delhi high court on Friday morning against trial court's judgement in Arvind Kejriwal case.AAP leader Atishi commented ""Satyamev Jayate"" (truth alone triumphs) following the grant of bail.Kejriwal's arrest stemmed from allegations tied to financial irregularities in the excise policy, which led to a high-profile investigation by the ED. The case has drawn significant attention and sparked numerous political reactions.""We have faith in the court… Kejriwal gets bail… truth wins…,"" Punjab CM and AAP leader Bhagwant Mann wrote on X.""Truth can be troubled, but not defeated,"" said AAP.Delhi Minister and AAP leader Saurabh Bharadwaj said, ""Rouse Avenue court granting bail to CM Arvind Kejriwal is a milestone for the whole country.

Kharge said that, ""Rahul Gandhi was elected from two seats. As per rules, he will have to vacate one seat and continue on one seat. Since June 18 is the last date, we have decided that Rahul should keep his Rae Bareli seat, since it has been very close to the family for a long time. He has received love from the people of Wayanad, and people there want him to retain the seat, but the rules do not allow it. So, after a lot of deliberations, we decided that Priyanka Gandhi should contest from Wayanad, and she has agreed.""Expressing her enthusiasm for the first electoral contest Priyanaka Gandhi said, ""I am very happy to be able to represent Wayanad.

He is bothered about his government and Speaker ... The PM has psychologically collapsed and he will struggle to run a government like this. PM Modi 's idea of running govt is to generate fear in people. But now people are not scared of him. The basic concept of Modi has been destroyed in this election. If there were Vajpayee ji or Manmohan Singh ji, they might have been able to survive because they had humility, respect and conciliation. But Narendra Modi doesn't believe in all this.""""Enquiry is underway, one (UGC-NET) has been cancelled; we don't know whether the other (NEET) one will be cancelled or not. But, someone is responsible for all this and they should be arrested and action should be taken against them,"" he added.He also explained why there has been a rise in such paper leaks.""The reason behind paper leaks is that the education system has been captured by the BJP's parent organisation. Till the time this is not reversed, paper leaks and cancellation of exams will go on. PM Modi has facilitated this capture. It is an anti-national activity,"" said Rahul.Talking directly to the affected students, the MP said: ""Our vice-chancellors are placed not based on merit but because they belong to a particular organisation. And this organisation and the BJP have penetrated our education system and destroyed it. What was done by PM Modi to the economy with demonetisation, has now been done to the education system. The reason this is happening and the reason you're suffering is because an independent, objective education system has been demolished ... It is very important that the people who are guilty here are brought to book and they are punished.""He went on to take a potshot at the PM, stating: ""It was said that Narendra Modi stopped the Ukraine-Russia conflict, Israel-Gaza war but due to some reason, he is either not able to stop the paper leaks in the country or he doesn't want to stop them.

There are internal problems too, there are problems in their party, there are issues in their parent organisation.

He was taken into custody, bailed and has been removed from operational duties.Last week it emerged that Craig Williams, parliamentary private secretary to Sunak and hitherto Tory MP for Montgomeryshire, was also facing a Gambling Commission probe. He is alleged to have placed a £100 (Rs 10,600) bet at odds of 5/1 on a July polling date three days before the July 4 election was called.

As the Gambling Commission is an independent body, it wouldn’t be proper to comment further.”The Tories on Thursday quietly deleted a gambling-themed advert from X which told voters “if you bet on Labour you can never win”.
