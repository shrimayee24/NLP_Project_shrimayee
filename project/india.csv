Devendra Fadnavis trashes Sanjay Raut's claim on PM Modi's 'looming retirement',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/devendra-fadnavis-trashes-sanjay-rauts-claim-on-pm-modis-looming-retirement/articleshow/119830253.cms,"Maharashtra deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis

NAGPUR: Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis Monday rejected speculation about his potential candidacy for prime ministerial role in 2029, asserting that PM Narendra Modi remains the 'undisputed leader of BJP' and has many years of service ahead.Fadnavis dismissed Sena UBT member Sanjay Raut 's claim that Modi's visit to Hedgewar memorial in Reshimbagh signalled his impending retirement, as baseless. ""In Hindu culture, a child is not considered a replacement for his father while the father is still alive. Such successions occur in Mughal culture, not ours. Modi remains our leader, and BJP is committed to seeing him continue as PM beyond 2029,"" he said.Raut claimed Modi's visit to RSS' Hedgewar memorial was meant to signal his exit from active politics in Sept this year, further suggesting that Modi's successor would be from Maharashtra and finalised by the Sangh. Modi turns 75 in Sept, and BJP has an informal rule that leaders beyond this age should not hold ministerial positions.Fadnavis also countered ex-Congress chief Sonia Gandhi's criticism of National Education Policy , which she termed 'communal, coercive agenda.' Defending the policy, he emphasised the necessity of dismantling the British-imposed education framework. ""British designed an education system to weaken Indian identity. Lord Macaulay explicitly stated in his letter that unless India's indigenous education was dismantled, British cannot rule. Any patriot should support efforts to Indianise our education system. Sonia must study these reforms properly and extend support,"" he said.On MNS chief Raj Thackeray's concerns on governance and rural distress, raised during his Gudi Padwa speech Sunday, Fadnavis said, ""We are working to take everyone along in running the govt. He raised some important points, and we will consider them. As for his suggestion on loudspeakers at mosques, we will strictly implement SC order prohibiting their use beyond permissible limits.""Addressing Thackeray's remarks on deteriorating condition of rivers in state, the CM pointed to the ongoing efforts to rejuvenate state's water resources, especially Godavari.","Fadnavis dismissed Sena UBT member Sanjay Raut's claim that Modi's visit to Hedgewar memorial in Reshimbagh signalled his impending retirement.

Row over Aurangzeb's tomb unnecessary: Senior RSS man,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/row-over-aurangzebs-tomb-unnecessary-rss/articleshow/119829829.cms,"Shivaji our ideal, he built tomb for even Afzal Khan: Bhaiyyaji

NAGPUR/MUMBAI: Senior RSS figure Suresh 'Bhaiyyaji' Joshi said in Nagpur on Monday that the issue of Aurangzeb's tomb was unnecessarily being raked up.""Aurangzeb ka anavashyak vishay uthaya gaya hai (The topic of Aurangzeb has been raised unnecessarily). He (Aurangzeb) died here, so his tomb has been built here. Those who have faith will go,"" he was quoted as saying in a video put out by PTI.The day also saw Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis reiterating his opposition to ""glorification"" of the tomb of the Mughal emperor, a hate figure among Hindutva supporters. However, he added that the tomb was an ASI-protected structure. The remarks of Fadnavis, who had earlier said it was ""unfortunate"" that the govt had to guard the place (tomb), did not appear to sit well with those of Joshi.Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis said, ""Whether we like it or not, it is our responsibility to follow the law. (But) we will not allow glorification over there at any cost.""While speaking on Aurangzeb, senior RSS functionary Suresh 'Bhaiyyaji' Joshi took an example from Shivaji's life. ""We have Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj as our adarsh (ideal). He had even built (Adilshahi general) Afzal Khan's tomb (at the base of Pratapgad fort). Bharat ki yeh udarta ki, sarvasamaveshakta ka prateek hai (This is a symbol of Bharat's generosity and inclusivity). Woh kabar rahe, aur jisko wahan jaana hai woh jayein (Aurangzeb's tomb can remain, and those who want to visit it can go there),"" he said.Joshi was responding to a question about MNS chief Raj Thackeray's comments on Sunday on the controversy over the tomb. Raj had said people should not fall victim to the politics of caste and communal hatred.Joshi's comments come less than a fortnight after RSS chief spokesperson Sunil Ambekar clarified that ""the tomb issue is not irrelevant, Aurangzeb is,"" after reports had quoted him as saying in a press conference in Bengaluru that ""Aurangzeb was not relevant today.""Joshi was 'sarkaryavaha' (general secretary) of the RSS for four terms starting 2009 and was replaced by Dattatreya Hosabale in 2021.The VHP and Bajrang Dal have demanded removal of the tomb, which is in Khultabad near Daulatabad in Maharashtra, and riots broke out in Nagpur on March 17 after the VHP's alleged act of burning an effigy of Aurangzeb and of a symbol of the tomb.Fadnavis, who is from Nagpur and of the favourites of the Sangh leadership, led BJP to a huge victory in the 2024 Maharashtra elections on an unabashedly Hindutva platform where he called upon Hindus to come together to foil ""vote jihad,"" a reference to the effort of opposition parties to consolidate Muslims against BJP.","Senior RSS figure Suresh 'Bhaiyyaji' Joshi says the issue of Aurangzeb's tomb is unnecessarily being raked up.
